    "text": "Weltweit auf der Flucht: Welthungerhilfe zu neuen UNHCR-Zahlen\nBonn/Berlin (ots) - Das UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR hat heute die aktuellen Zahlen zu Flucht und Vertreibung veröffentlicht. Die Zahl der gewaltsam vertriebenen Menschen ist im vergangenen Jahr erneut gestiegen. 122,1 Millionen Menschen sind mit Stand Ende April 2025 weltweit vor Krieg und Verfolgung geflohen. Die Welthungerhilfe kommentiert die neuen Flüchtlingszahlen:\nStatement Mathias Mogge, Generalsekretär der Welthungerhilfe:\n\"Der neue Weltflüchtlingsbericht ist ein dramatischer Weckruf: Mit 122 Millionen Menschen, die weltweit auf der Flucht vor Krieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung sind, erreicht die Zahl der Vertriebenen erneut einen historischen Höchststand. Dabei trifft gewaltsame Vertreibung vor allem die Jüngsten: rund 40 Prozent aller Vertriebenen sind Kinder. Die Zahl der gewaltsamen Konflikte hat sich seit mehr als 10 Jahren verdoppelt und zwingt immer mehr Familien zur Flucht. Die meisten Geflüchteten finden dabei in den Nachbarländern Zuflucht - in Staaten, die selbst mit Armut und instabilen Strukturen zu kämpfen haben.\nDie größte Vertreibungs- und Hungerkrise spielt sich aktuell im Sudan ab. Rund ein Drittel der Menschen sind vertrieben und fast 25 Millionen Menschen leiden unter akutem Hunger. Besonders dramatisch ist die Situation rund um das Geflüchteten-Camp ZamZam in Nord-Darfur. Der Zugang für humanitäre Hilfe ist extrem eingeschränkt und es ist fast unmöglich die Menschen zu erreichen, obwohl diese so dringend auf Hilfe angewiesen sind. Im April 2025 wurde das ZamZam-Camp Ziel von mehreren gewaltsamen Angriffen, was dazu führte, dass 400.000 Menschen erneut fliehen mussten und nun ohne Hilfe im Nirgendwo ausharren müssen.\nAuch in Gaza und der Ukraine treiben Krieg und Gewalt immer mehr Menschen in die Flucht. Im Gazastreifen sind praktisch alle der über zwei Millionen Menschen auf Hilfe angewiesen. Und auch dort fehlt der ausreichende und ungehinderte Zugang zu den Hungernden.\nWährend die Zahl der Geflüchteten, der Hungernden, der gewaltsamen Konflikte steigt, werden die Mittel für humanitäre Hilfe massiv gekürzt. Das ist nicht nur unverantwortlich, sondern gefährdet jeden Tag Menschenleben. Humanitäre Hilfe darf nicht zur Disposition stehen. Sie ist überlebenswichtig.\nWenn wir nicht konsequent in Friedenslösungen investieren, wird diese Spirale aus Krieg, Vertreibung und Hunger weitergehen. Es braucht politischen Willen, Investitionen in Friedensprozesse und echte Perspektiven für den Wiederaufbau. Frieden darf kein ferner Traum bleiben. Wer heute bei der Hilfe spart, riskiert, dass morgen noch mehr Menschen alles verlieren.\"\nWeitere Informationen finden Sie unter www.welthungerhilfe.de/presse\nDie Welthungerhilfe ist eine der größten privaten Hilfsorganisationen in Deutschland; politisch und konfessionell unabhängig. Sie setzt sich mutig und entschlossen für eine Welt ohne Hunger ein. Seit ihrer Gründung am 14.12.1962 wurden 12.128 Auslandsprojekte in rund 72 Ländern mit 5,07 Milliarden Euro gefördert. Die Welthungerhilfe arbeitet nach dem Grundprinzip der Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe: von der schnellen Katastrophenhilfe über den Wiederaufbau bis zu langfristigen Projekten der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit mit nationalen und internationalen Partnerorganisationen.\nPressekontakt:\nHerausgeber:\nDeutsche Welthungerhilfe e.V.\nAnsprechpartnerinnen:\nSimone Pott\nPressesprecherin\nTelefon 0228-2288-132\nMobil 0172-2525962\nsimone.pott@welthungerhilfe.de\nAssistenz: Catherine Briones\nTelefon 0228-2288-640\npresse@welthungerhilfe.de\nwww.welthungerhilfe.de\nWeiteres Material:\nwww.presseportal.de\nQuelle: Deutsche Welthungerhilfe e.V.",

    "title": "From passionate basketball player to committed manager",
    "text": "As a student manager for the UA men’s basketball team, Canyon Torres’ love for his favorite sport has evolved over the years. Growing up in Tucson, Torres played the game throughout his youth and in high school.\nHe said he realized at some point that he wouldn’t continue playing basketball competitively after high school, but still was passionate about the game and didn’t want to leave it behind. So, during his freshman year, Torres joined the UA men’s team as an equipment manager.\nNow, as a sophomore, Torres has bigger goals. After connecting with the players and coaches, learning and gaining knowledge, he hopes to join the men’s coaching staff after he graduates.\nBeing a student manager has many benefits, he said, but it also has its challenges.\n“Nobody knows what goes into the program,\" he said. “And it feels like a 9-to-5 with a lot of work.”\nPeople are also reading…\nStudent managers are expected to be available to staff and coaches, help scout for the team, help the program with team film and support the coaches.\nAs a student manager, preparing for game days means making sure players are ready and there on time, and that their equipment is well organized. It also means helping players arrive on time for film sessions and warm-ups before the game starts.\nTorres said on game days, the McKale Center’s fan base creates a lot of great energy, and even on-the-road energy is contagious. Torres loves the environment as he is walking out with the players onto the court — especially when they are about to play against a good opponent. After a win? Torres describes it as a great feeling and said celebrating in the locker room with the team is electric.\nOne of the challenges of working with the team, however, is missing out on college life because you are so busy with basketball.\n“You get FOMO, and if you don’t love being around the game, you’re wasting your time,” he said. “You don’t have much free time, you never know what days you have off while making time for yourself to be available for the team.”\nTorres said his time with the team has changed him, both personally and professionally. He used to be silent around players and coaches. His time on the team has helped him communicate better, he said. Now, he speaks up about what he believes in. He’s also learned directly from Arizona’s men’s basketball head coach Tommy Lloyd, as well as Brian Briggs, the program’s equipment manager.\nWith more than 20 years of experience in basketball management, Briggs has spread his skills and knowledge among his student managers and the program. Working together for a common goal and making sure players are taken care of is his philosophy for success.\nBriggs said Torres is a hard worker who is always on the move, and he appreciates what Torres has brought to the program and team.\nFew students work with the UA basketball team, and Torres has taken full advantage of the opportunity, making a name for himself with Briggs and the staff. As Torres enters his second year as equipment manger, Briggs said he will continue pushing him to be better at his work and craft.\nArizona Sonoran News is a news service of the University of Arizona School of Journalism.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
