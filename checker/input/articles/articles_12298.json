    "title": "Bridal Bliss: Curvy Influencer Rochelle And Michael Johnson Celebrated 15 Years Of Marriage With A Vow Renewal On The Beach | Essence",
    "text": "By Victoria Uwumarogie · Updated April 18, 2024\nThinking back to the first time Rochelle and Michael (aka, Ro and Mike) said I do on March 20, 2009, at his father’s church, Full Counsel Metro in North Little Rock, Arkansas, the fashion influencer and lifestyle maven has nothing but great memories. “It was truly a beautiful day,” she recalls to ESSENCE. “We were so young, both of us 22 at the time, and there was so much we didn’t know.”\nThat included the fact that their bridesmaids probably should have had their hair and makeup professionally done, but those were simpler times. What they did know was that they were meant for each other.\nRochelle and Michael had met a few years prior during their freshman year at Oral Roberts University. In a relationship at the time but always ready to spotlight great fashion, a friendly Rochelle complimented Michael on his “impeccable style.” That would be the beginning of a friendship that, by senior year, turned into much more.\nNine months into their romantic relationship, he proposed, and about five months later, they wed in front of a whopping 500 people. (“That’s not because we actually knew that many people,” Rochelle notes. “Out of pure excitement of the union, the entire church congregation was invited to attend the ceremony.”) The groom was impeccably dressed, as always, and the bride, a true “fashion girlie,” wore a fly Oleg Cassini princess gown “with a pleated satin bodice adorned with lots of poofy tulle.”\nIt was the perfect day. So how does one top that for a 15th wedding anniversary vow renewal? By saying “I do” again in a destination vow renewal ceremony. The Johnsons did just that in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico , inviting friends, family, and, most precious, the couple’s two children, Creed, 7, and Evan, 2, to be a part of the fun.\nSaint Street Studio “Having my original bridal party there, along with my babies, was a dream come true,” says Rochelle of the event, which took place on March 21, 2024. “Ever since I envisioned a vow renewal, I always pictured having a little girl and a little boy there, and to have my own children present was incredibly heartwarming.”\nThe event, a dream beach wedding brought to fruition, celebrated long-lasting love. Staying married for 15 years hasn’t been easy, but a shared desire to make it work and genuine love make it all possible for the college sweethearts.\n“A teamwork mentality. Doing things together. It’s all about focusing on building together,” says Michael.\nCheck out the beautiful way the Johnsons celebrated their love story in Mexico, and learn how it all came together in this week’s Bridal Bliss .\n01 01 A Blushing Bride Rochelle is captured in her bridal gown. She wore a dress from Brooklyn’s Pantora Bridal and shoes by Christian Louboutin. Her bouquet from her first wedding was made of 100 roses, and this bouquet, created by Blossom Cancun, was also a showstopper.\nSaint Street Studio 02 02 A Dapper Groom The groom wore a very unique brown tuxedo from Ndeed Regime, with shoes by Alexander McQueen. Brown is a color you’ll see lots of in their celebration photos. “We were actually inspired by a viral wedding photo we came across. In the photo, the bridal party was dressed in all neutrals, and it looked incredible!” Rochelle says. “So, we asked our guests to wear shades of neutrals—browns, tans, golds, creams.”\nSaint Street Studio 03 03 A Little Lady The couple’s 2-year-old daughter, Evan, looked as cute as can be in her dress for the occasion.\nSaint Street Studio 04 04 Like Father, Like Son The couple’s oldest child, 7-year-old son Creed, also showed up and showed out in a neutral suit for the celebration.\nSaint Street Studio 05 05 The Venue Rochelle, a Southern California native, always wanted a beach wedding. The Grand Hyatt Playa Del Carmen provided that and more. The couple’s wedding planner, Joyce, from Dream Weddings Riviera Maya, made the day magical.\nSaint Street Studio 06 06 Here Comes the Bride “When I was walking down the aisle, Mike was crying,” Rochelle recalls as one of her favorite moments of the day. “He was overwhelmed with joy and emotion. You don’t get to see that often. That was beautiful to see from him.”\nSaint Street Studio 07 07 Meet Me at the Altar The vow exchange was a favorite moment for both Rochelle and Michael. “The vows he wrote took my breath away,” she says lovingly. “The words pierced my heart so deeply. I saw a side of him that I rarely see. Not because he isn’t always loving but because life can get in the way of things. We are balancing being parents to small kids including a special needs child while building a business and working in ministry. While he was reciting his vows and pouring his heart out, I felt like I had been swept away to the most romantic fairytale. It was such a beautiful moment. Everyone could feel the love. I will never forget it.”\n08 08 You May Kiss the Bride…Again “Well, I will say that while my vows were emotional, Ro took the funny route,” Michael says. “And it’s normally the other way around. She is normally the emotional one and I have more of a sense of humor. Her “Let them Instagram ho-s know” literally reminded me that I was in fact renewing my vows to my unhinged best friend. It was all so good!”\nSaint Street Studio 09 09 The Johnson Family While the vow renewal was a special moment for Rochelle and Michael, it was also a big deal for their kids. “This was their first international trip, and although we were a bit anxious about how it would go—especially since my son is on the Autism spectrum—he did wonderfully,” she says. “Their presence made the vow renewal all the more special.”\nSaint Street Studio 10 10 The First Dance “I would say the key to a long-lasting marriage begins with marrying your best friend,” Rochelle says. “To this day, Mike and I are still best friends. I would choose to spend my day with him over anyone else. I remember telling my college roommate, ‘Whoever marries Mike Johnson is going to have such a great life’… I didn’t think it would be me, but I was onto something! Marrying someone who possesses integrity is just as important, and ultimately the most crucial factor. You can build on everything else.”\nSaint Street Studio 11 11 A Family Dance “We had a cocktail hour followed by a reception,” says the bride. “We planned to have fireworks during the cocktail hour but high winds and strong waves threw a wrench in those plans. The dinner was amazing and the reception was incredible! It was so humid and we were all so hot but we all just danced the night away. We ended the night with churros and margaritas!”\nSaint Street Studio 12 12 Issa Party “Definitely have to mention the dancing at the reception,” Michael says of one of his favorite moments from the day. “Creed and Evan wouldn’t leave the dance floor. We filmed a TikTok dance. Rochelle’s parents reminded us that they still knew how to get down on the dance floor, which was a pretty epic moment!”\nSaint Street Studio 13 13 Everybody Dance Now We’d love to have seen this choreographed dance scene in person! This photo also gives a good look at Rochelle’s reception dress, made by Onalaja.\nSaint Street Studio 14 14 15 More Years and Forever The couple, who have been “inseparable” since they tied the knot in 2009, are stronger than ever. Here’s to another 15 years of love and laughter, times infinity!\nSaint Street Studio Vendors\nPlanner: Joyce of Dream Weddings Riviera Maya\nVenue: Grand Hyatt Playa Del Carmen\nRings: Tacori\nFlowers: Blossom Cancún\nMakeup: Jaurdane Ivory\nVow Renewal Dress: Pantora Bridal\nReception Dress: Onalaja\nTuxedo: Ndeed Regime\nPhoto and Videography: Saint Street Studio",

    "text": "El vocero presidencial encabezó la conferencia de prensa matutina desde la Casa Rosada frente a los periodistas acreditados. Por Canal26 Viernes 13 de Septiembre de 2024 - 11:10 [Manuel Adorni](https://www.canal26.com/politica/manuel-adorni-se-logro-bajar-la-inflacion-del-255-en-diciembre-al-4-en-el-mes-de-julio-sin-chamanismo-economico--391007) encabezó este viernes 13 de septiembre su habitual conferencia de prensa matutina. El vocero presidencial contestó las preguntas diarias de los periodistas acreditados en la Casa Rosada acerca de la actualidad [del gobierno que lidera el presidente Javier Milei](https://www.canal26.com/politica/javier-milei-apunto-contra-los-mandriles-que-especulan-con-la-suba-del-dolar--390762). Te puede interesar: Manuel Adorni: \"Se logró bajar la inflación del 25,5% en diciembre al 4% en el mes de julio sin 'chamanismo económico'\" Este viernes, mencionó como \"insólito\" el paro de aeronáuticos que afecta a más de 300 vuelos y aseguró que los empleados de Aerolíneas Argentinas que se suman a la medida de fuerza serán \"multados y sancionados\" por la firma. \"Quienes no quieren resignar sus privilegios, van a terminar fundiendo la empresa que tanto dicen defender”, afirmó al comenzar su conferencia de prensa. Además, remarcó que “mientras que los argentinos que pasan meses ahorrando para comprar un pasaje de avión” ven afectados sus vuelos, es posible encontrar a “algún sindicalista de vacaciones en España junto a toda su familia, disfrutando de los placeres que le da el lugar que ocupa”. Incluso tuvo críticas contra los pilotos, que pueden “viajar gratis, en clase ejecutiva, junto a sus familias”, lo que representa un “despilfarro de 20 millones de dólares por año”. Por esto mismo, Adorni consideró que “no hay ninguna razón para seguir sosteniendo en un país empobrecido como el nuestro este tipo de privilegios para unos pocos”. En medio de la medida de fuerza, se confirmó que Javier Milei firma este viernes la reglamentación del Artículo 182 del Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia que establece los lineamientos para declarar como servicio esencial a la aeronáutica civil y comercial. Por otro lado, el vocero afirmó que mientras parte de los legisladores nacionales aprueban leyes con el objetivo de “quebrar el equilibrio fiscal”, para el Gobierno del Presidente Javier Milei “el equilibrio fiscal es absolutamente innegociable”, por lo que afirmó que “ese mandato va a estar asentado en el Presupuesto 2025” que el Jefe de Estado presentará este domingo a las 21 horas en el Congreso de la Nación. Además, el Vocero Presidencial celebró la aprobación del proyecto de implementación de la boleta única de papel que “fomenta la transparencia electoral y reduce el costo de las elecciones”, y aseguró que esta Ley representa un ahorro cercano al 50% de los aportes del Estado Nacional a los partidos políticos, que en el año 2023 fue de más de 16.000 millones de pesos. 1 Adorni calificó de \"insólito\" el paro de aeronáuticos y anunció que habrá multas para los que se adhieran 2 El Senado rechazó el DNU de los fondos para la SIDE y aprobó la ley de financiamiento universitario 3 El Senado aprobó en general la Boleta Única de Papel: podría implementarse en las elecciones 2025 4 Javier Milei visita el predio de la Sociedad Rural en un nuevo guiño al campo argentino 5 Cristina Kirchner se presenta en Merlo: doctorado en Honoris Causa y discurso sobre su texto económico Mantenete siempre informado",

    "text": "EF-1 tornado touched down in Gilmer County during storms, National Weather Service confirms ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - An EF-1 tornado touched down in Gilmer County during a line of intense storms Wednesday night and Thursday morning, a preliminary report from the National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed. The tornado had maximum winds between 90 and 100 mph, the NWS said. Its path is still being investigated. The NWS sent a survey team to the county on Friday after the strong winds downed power lines, felled trees, and ripped the roofs off of some buildings. “For the community, it’s good to understand exactly what happened. And it helps to educate folks around the area that this kind of thing can happen and how localized it can be,” said David Nadler, who works for the NWS as a warning coordination meteorologist. On Wednesday, the county was under a tornado warning from around 10:45 p.m. until 11:15 p.m. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: [Significant damage left behind by overnight storms in Gilmer County](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/05/09/significant-damage-left-behind-by-overnight-storms-gilmer-county/) Near Old Highway 5 and Ellington Road in Ellijay, Atlanta News First crews saw large strips of tin roofing littered on the ground and hanging from at least one power line. Resident William Buckner said his family has owned land off of Old Highway 5 for nearly 80 years — but he’s never seen storm damage like this before. His yard was littered with roofing, two-by-fours, and power lines. Some of the debris came from a nearby storage facility belonging to the Georgia Forestry Commission. “I went back in the house, and I told my wife to get down. We got down, and about 20 minutes later, it was gone,” he said. “I went right in the house in the nick of time, and it just tore everything up.” A [warming center is now open](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0267y7VLqDdiqVaZQ8uLo1BsZVWEH661exNA2zD45UvxGBYmb7QVxSE5utuFVsDnrzl&id=61553884962405&ref=embed_post) at 1561 S Main St. in Ellijay for those who need shelter. The American Red Cross of Georgia said it has helped at least 29 people after severe weather swept through the state this week. That number is expected to rise, the organization added.

    "text": "La Copa Sevilla Tenis se está disputando en el Real Club de Tenis de la ciudad desde este pasado 1 de septiembre. La final está prevista para este domingo, por lo que tenemos por delante un fin de semana de tenis al más alto nivel en la ciudad.Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos Este torneo celebra su edición número 61, se trata del torneo con más prestigioso de Andalucía y el tercero de España, sólo por detrás del Conde Godó y el Master 1000 de Madrid. Este año también cuenta con la novedad de la tierra batida en sus pistas. Un terreno que ya han probado estos días grandes tenistas como Albert Ramos o Roberto Carballés. Santiago Pérez, director de la Copa Sevilla, ha atendido a 7TV para valorar el papel de este tenista y su importancia en la historia de este torneo: “Es favorito desde el momento en que ha sido finalista y campeón en dos ocasiones aquí”. El único inconveniente que se le puede buscar a este torneo es la fecha, que suele ser un problema a nivel logístico para los tenistas. De cara a la próxima edición, la organización se plantea cambiarlo: “Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos, llegan aquí con jet lag. Yo que hablo con ellos percibo lo complicado que es jugar un torneo como este cuando apenas han dormido tres horas”, añade Santiago Pérez a los micrófonos de 7TV. Aunque la Copa Sevilla se juega desde el año 1963, esta obtuvo la denominación de Challenger en el 1991, convirtiéndola así en puntuable para la ATP. A lo largo de su historia han pasado por sus pistas estrellas como Rafa Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz o Manolo Santana.
