    "text": "COVID-19 COVID-19: Local COVID-19: National COVID-19: Business Coronavirus 101 Newsletter News Nation/World Trust in science hasn’t fully recovered from pandemic controversies Nov. 14, 2024 Updated Thu., Nov. 14, 2024 at 5:41 p.m. A young man waits in an empty patient waiting area after receiving a coronavirus vaccine at a vaccination site on June 2, 2021, during a time when the division in attitudes toward scientists grew rapidly. (Kim Raff/FTWP) X Email Reddit SMS By Joel Achenbach Washington Post The pandemic and the chaos and controversies that came with it led to an erosion of trust in scientists, and it may be a while before that trust returns to levels that preceded the contagion. That’s the implication of a survey published Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\nThe organization asked adults in the United States if they have confidence in scientists to “act in the best interests of the public.” The vast majority of people still do, saying they have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of confidence.\nBut although the new numbers show a small uptick in trust in scientists over the past year, the public’s confidence in that community remains significantly eroded.\nWhen Pew conducted such a survey in January 2019, 86% of respondents said they had “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of confidence in scientists. That sentiment held steady at 87% in the April 2020 survey at the height of the initial wave of infections that struck the United States. But in a survey in November 2020 that figure began to show the erosion, and trust bottomed out at 73% in October 2023.\nThe latest result showed a small bump to 76%.\n“We’re calling it a slight uptick,” said Alec Tyson, associate director at Pew Research Center and lead author of the report. “At least for now, it marks an end to the decline that we saw during the pandemic.”\nThe survey captures a partisan divide over scientists and their role in crafting policy. Democrats have a higher level of trust in scientists than Republicans, and are significantly more positive than Republicans about scientists being engaged in policy discussions.\nAmericans give research scientists fairly high marks for intelligence and the ability to solve real-world problems. But only 65% view them as “honest,” and 47% described them as feeling “superior to others.” Slightly more than a third of respondents said scientists don’t “pay attention to the moral values of society.”\n“My reading of that data is there’s room for scientists to be seen as more connected to the everyday issues that people face in their own lives,” Tyson said.\nThe survey comes at a moment of uncertainty for scientific organizations and government agencies as President-elect Donald Trump assembles a new administration. In his first term, Trump’s initial budget requests called for cuts in funding of some scientific research, but science has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\nThe partisan divide in attitudes toward scientists grew rapidly between the April 2020 and December 2021 Pew surveys. Among Republicans and independents leaning Republican, confidence in scientists fell from 85% to 63%.\nIn that period and beyond, the pandemic generated a swarm of controversies that pivoted on scientific research but were also influenced by misinformation and political agendas. Social media provided a decentralized platform for robust and rancorous debates about school closures, social distancing, potential cures for covid, the utility of masks and the origin of the virus.\nScientists such as Anthony S. Fauci, the most prominent spokesperson for the scientific community during the pandemic, have been grilled by Republican lawmakers in contentious congressional hearings. Across the country, public health officials endured a ferocious backlash.\n“What you had was a sustained attack on a sector of science,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn the latest survey, however, Republican trust in scientists increased 5%, noted Tyson. And he said Democrats have also experienced a shift in attitudes since 2021: They are much less likely to say they have a “great deal” of confidence in scientists.\nScience is not the only enterprise facing an erosion of trust. Surveys have shown a significant decline in the percentage of Americans who trust the federal government, the Supreme Court, political parties, business leaders and the news media.\n“Overall we’re seeing decline in trust in institutions,” Jamieson said. “Confidence in and trust in science remains high compared to those other institutions.”\nBut scientists made mistakes, she added. For example, some oversold the ability of vaccines to prevent covid infections.\n“People were told if you just took the vaccine, everything was going to be fine,” she said.\nMarcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, recalls that in early 2020 a reporter asked her to forecast the impact of the spreading coronavirus. Her response: “This will be science’s finest hour. Science is going to come up with a vaccine to save us all.”\nThe vaccines did appear – and yet trust in science went down.\n“Every scientist I know would have loved to see a massive rebound” in trust in science, McNutt said, referring to the Pew results. “But this gives us an opportunity to reexamine what we need to do to restore trust in science.”",

A él también se sumó, más temprano, [el argentino Christian Moreno](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/12/26/cobresal-se-afianza-como-el-equipo-con-mas-refuerzos-de-primera-division-sumaron-su-octava-cara-nueva/).\nEn diálogo con ADN Deportes, el central de 28 años explicó su determinación de venir al fútbol chileno. “Tenía varias propuestas de Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia y esto salió al último, se dio, hablé con el técnico, me gustó lo transparente que fueron conmigo y eso me motivó. Mi expectativa es que el club entre nuevamente a copas y pelee en lo más alto”, recalcó, destacando su versatilidad táctica en la zaga.\n“Me adapto a la línea de tres y a la de cuatro. Me tocó jugar de stopper por derecha en mi debut en Boca y ahora de central izquierdo en Venezuela. En Almirante Brown jugué de central izquierdo, derecho, de cinco, de cuatro. Me adapto”, comentó Christian Moreno, quien igualmente reconoció que todavía debe pasar por la adaptación a un equipo del que no conoce demasiado.\n“Sé que el año pasado estuvieron a punto de salir campeón. No sé cuáles son mis compañeros, no he chusmeado eso todavía. Veo que es una ciudad chica, es un club que quiere crecer. Llego para aportar ese granito de arena, sumar en la línea defensiva y en el grupo”, concluyó Christian Moreno en ADN Deportes.",

    "text": "Security researchers from Group-IB discover a unique new piece of malware It exploits extended attributes for macOS files to implement the payload The malware was most likely built by North Korean state-sponsored actors Cybersecurity researchers have encountered yet another malware variant for macOS that was likely built by North Korea’s infamous Lazarus group.\nGroup-IB’s report concerns the discovery of RustyAttr, a brand new piece of macOS malware built using the Tauri framework. T\nThe malware was not flagged on VirusTotal and was at some point signed with a legitimate Apple developer ID. The ID has now been withdrawn.\nExtensive attributes Days before, Jamf researchers found something similar: a seemingly benign app on VirusTotal, built with Flutter, that served as a backdoor for macOS victims.\nIn both cases, the malware used new obfuscation methods but was not yet fully operational, leading researchers to believe they were just experiments while crooks looked for new ways to hide the infection.\nRustyAttr was found to be abusing extended attributes for macOS, the researchers claim.\nExtended attributes (xattrs) are a feature that allows files and folders to store additional metadata beyond standard attributes such as name, size, and permissions. They are used for a variety of things, from storing security-related information to tagging files with specific metadata and enabling compatibility with other file systems. In this case, the EA name was “test” and contained a shell script.\nSign up for the Ny Breaking newsletter and get all the best news, opinions, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWhen the malware runs, it loads a website with a piece of JavaScript. This JavaScript, called preload.js, pulls content from “test”, which appears to be a location. This location is then sent to the ‘run_command’ function, where the shell script executes it.\nWhile the process is in progress, the victim is tricked with a decoy PDF file or a fake error message that appears in the foreground.\nRustyAttr was most likely built by Lazarus, the researchers said, although since no casualties have been reported, they cannot be absolutely certain. However, they believe the malware is built to test new delivery and obfuscation methods on macOS devices.\nVia BleepingComputer\nYou might also like it",

    "text": "Los cinco fenómenos implacables del cambio climático en 2023 Terminaremos este 2023 padeciendo el año más caluroso de la historia. Eventos destructivos e inquietantes como olas de calor, inundaciones, incendios forestales, terremotos y sequías dejan ver que la alarma global timbra cada vez más fuerte Crisis climática Estaciones confundidas, vientos que desgajan árboles, sequías desérticas, glaciares perdidos, temperaturas incandescentes, infiernos en los bosques, humaderas continentales… Sin duda, el cambio climático se mostró despiadado este 2023. La pasada Cumbre Climática COP28, y su anuncio del supuesto adiós de los combustibles fósiles, arrojó más interrogantes que certezas. La alarma global sigue timbrando y queda mucho por discutir y hacer. La Tierra resiste una sinfonía de alteraciones climáticas que han puesto a nuestro civilización al borde del colapso ambiental. Y es que ya no hablamos de calentamiento sino de “ebullición global\", aseguró el secretario general de la ONU António Guterres. Y a lo largo del año encontramos al menos cinco fenómenos implacables que irrumpieron con sonoro eco de advertencia. 1. Olas de calor: 2023 el año más caliente Este año, las olas de calor históricas no dieron tregua, poniendo incluso vidas en peligro. En Europa, América y Asia, los termómetros se dispararon hasta alrededor de los 50 °C. Roma, batió por récords de calor, y la región de Lazio, con un aumento del 20% en emergencias médicas. España anotó temperaturas insoportables, como los 45.4 °C en Figueres, Girona. En Alemania, el calor sin precedentes desató debates sobre la introducción de siestas laborales para sobrellevar las condiciones extremas. Francia impuso la alerta naranja por altas temperaturas en nueve departamentos mediterráneos. China y la ciudad de Turpan al noroeste experimentaron una histórica temperatura de 52.2 grados, la más alta jamás documentada en la región. En EU, cerca de 100 millones de personas estuvieron bajo alerta por máximas extremas. Phoenix marcó un nuevo récord con 19 días consecutivos de temperaturas superiores a 43 grados. Y en el sur de África, se batieron récords de temperaturas en Botsuana, Namibia y Sudáfrica. Según el Servicio de Cambio Climático Copernicus de la Unión Europea, 2023 terminará como el año más caluroso de los últimos 125,000 años cuando termine en diciembre. Y por si fuera poco, la OMM dio a conocer que se espera que el actual fenómeno de El Niño dure al menos hasta abril de 2024. 2. Incendios forestales, fuegos sin precedentes En los primeros meses de 2023, una serie devastadora de incendios forestales dejó una huella de destrucción y tragedia en diversas partes del mundo. Desde Chile hasta Brasil, los incendios consumieron vastas extensiones de tierra, cobrando vidas y destruyendo comunidades enteras. En febrero, Chile se vio afectado por incendios que provocaron la pérdida de 26 vidas, la destrucción de al menos 2,400 viviendas y la calcinación de 440,000 hectáreas en las regiones centrales de Biobío y Ñuble, así como en la sureña región de La Araucanía. En junio, EU enfrentó una ola masiva de incendios, con más de 850 eventos registrados en una veintena de estados. Nuevo México lideró en extensión calcinada, con más de 84 incendios y una superficie afectada de 358,384 hectáreas, seguido por Texas, Alaska y Arizona. Canadá preocupó bastante con sus más de 1,000 incendios forestales entre finales de junio y finales de agosto. La Columbia Británica sufrió la mayor parte, con 379 incendios y la pérdida de más de 150,000 kilómetros cuadrados de espacio forestal. Incluso la costa este de EU experimentó los efectos del humo arrojando un paisaje desolador. Grecia enfrentó una crisis en julio y septiembre, con más de 150,000 hectáreas de terreno forestal y agrícola ardiendo en todo el país. La región de Evros y las islas de Rodas, Corfú y Eubea fueron particularmente afectadas. Italia vio más de 51.386 hectáreas consumidas, concentrándose la mayoría de la destrucción en Sicilia. EU, por su parte, enfrentó una tragedia sin precedentes en Hawái, con 115 muertos y 388 desaparecidos en los incendios que arrasaron la isla de Maui, marcando uno de los eventos más dramáticos en un siglo. Y en noviembre, Brasil se enfrentó a la furia de los incendios en el Pantanal, el mayor humedal del planeta. La primera quincena del mes registró un alarmante récord de 3,098 incendios, coincidiendo de manera inusual con la estación húmeda. 3. Terremotos que estremecieron al mundo El poder destructivo los terremotos, influido por la crisis del clima, dejó una estela de devastación y tragedia en diversas partes del mundo. El 6 de febrero, Turquía y Siria fueron testigos de la furia de la tierra cuando un terremoto de magnitud 7.7 sacudió la región. Con epicentro en Pazarcik, el sismo dejó tras de sí una estampa desgarradora: más de 59,000 turcos muertos, mientras que en Siria la cifra superó los 4,500 fallecidos. El 8 de septiembre, la región de Marrakech-Safí en Marruecos fue el epicentro de otro terremoto, esta vez de magnitud 6.8. El saldo fue desgarrador: más de 2,900 vidas perdidas, más de 5,500 heridos y miles de personas quedaron sin hogar. La tierra tembló con una fuerza tal que desencadenó una tragedia humanitaria que desafió los esfuerzos de rescate y reconstrucción. Afganistán, el 7 de octubre, enfrentó su propia prueba de resistencia. Un terremoto de 6.3 de magnitud en Herat se cobró la vida de al menos 2,400 personas y dejó a más de 2,000 heridas. Las réplicas sucesivas prolongaron la agonía, causando daños adicionales y desafiando la capacidad del gobierno talibán para responder eficazmente. Y el 3 de noviembre, Nepal sufrió un seísmo de magnitud 6.4 que dejó un saldo de al menos 153 personas fallecidas. Tres días después, una fuerte réplica volvió a estremecer la región, exacerbando la angustia de una población ya afectada. 4. Lluvias torrenciales, tragedias desatadas Las lluvias inclementes se conviertieron este 2023 en heraldos de tragedias en diversas partes del mundo, dejando a su paso un rastro de destrucción y pérdida de vidas. En Ruanda, del 2 al 3 de mayo, las provincias del oeste, incluyendo los distritos de Ngororero, Rubavu, Rutsiro y Karongi, sufrieron las embestidas despiadadas de las precipitaciones. Deslizamientos de tierra y el desbordamiento del río Sebeya segaron la vida de 135 personas y destruyeron seis mil hogares. El 4 de mayo, en el este de la República Democrática del Congo, el territorio de Kalehe fue testigo del desplome del cielo. Inundaciones, riadas y corrimientos de tierra cobraron un precio devastador, con al menos 438 personas que perdieron la vida. Mientras que en septiembre, Libia sufrió la rotura de dos presas cercanas a la ciudad oriental de Derna. Un tsunami devastó todo con sus 33 millones de metros cúbicos de agua. La cifra de muertos, según OMS, superó los 4,267, mientras que las autoridades libias reportaron más de 11,000 fallecidos y al menos 10,000 desaparecidos. Mientras que recientemente, el huracán Otis dejó muestras palpables de la crisis climática en el Pacífico. Tocó tierra con categoría 5 en Guerrero y provocó al menos 46 muertos, 58 desparecidos y miles de damnificados. 5. Sequías silenciosas, alarma de muerte El año 2023 dejó también un signo preocupante sobre el fenómeno de las sequías, que a menudo pasa desapercibido pero que tiene consecuencias mortales. Esta primavera, Europa enfrentó una grave crisis hídrica intensificada por una sequía de varios años debido a la baja precipitación invernal y la escasez de nieve. Aunque hubo cierto alivio en el sur de Europa cuando el patrón de precipitación cambió a condiciones húmedas normales o superiores al promedio entre abril y junio, la perspectiva general seguía siendo crítica. La persistente escasez y las olas de calor afectaron negativamente a los cultivos, con el Mar Báltico, Escandinavia, el Reino Unido, Irlanda, España y Alemania lidiando con una grave sequía meteorológica que comprometió los rendimientos de los cultivos en algunas regiones. La reducción de los niveles de agua en el Rin, uno de los principales ríos de Europa, generó preocupaciones para la navegación a lo largo de Alemania. El Reino Unido también experimentó niveles récord bajos en los ríos, aumentando el riesgo de graves escaseces de agua. La Oficina Meteorológica Británica señaló un 30% de probabilidad de condiciones más secas de lo habitual, resaltando la importancia de la preparación proactiva. Los expertos enfatizaron la necesidad de adaptarse a sequías prolongadas, señalando el papel del cambio climático en la exacerbación de la situación. Mientras que una sequía severa afectó al 5% de los estados contiguos de EU, en China, el 15-20% de la población experimentó una creciente frecuencia de sequías moderadas a severas, cuya intensidad se proyecta aumentará en un 80% para el año 2100. En septiembre, el río Amazonas de Brasil experimentó una escasez de agua sin precedentes, con niveles aproximadamente seis metros por debajo del año anterior. Las comunidades en la zona enfrentaron escasez de recursos debido a temperaturas récord y una sequía inusual en la cuenca del río. El año que está por terminar deja constancia de que el planeta clama por ajustes que permitan limitar el calentamiento global a 1.5 ºC. Pero desgraciadamente se está imponiendo un verdad irrebocable, vamos por el peor camino para alcanzar los objetivos del Acuerdo de París, para cumplir con los más importantes compromisos medioambientales.",

    "title": "США эвакуируют дипломатов и семьи военных с Ближнего Востока на фоне роста напряженности с Ираном",
    "text": "Государственный департамент и Министерство обороны США в среду приняли меры по эвакуации некритического персонала с объектов на Ближнем Востоке.\nОб этом сообщили американские чиновники и источники, знакомые с ситуацией, передает CNN.\nПока неясно, что именно вызвало такую внезапную смену позиции, но представитель оборонного ведомства отметил, что Центральное командование США (CENTCOM) наблюдает за «ростом напряженности на Ближнем Востоке».\n«Их вывозят, потому что это может стать опасным местом, посмотрим, что будет дальше. Но мы либо уже вывезли, либо дали указание эвакуироваться — посмотрим, как будут развиваться события», — сказал президент Дональд Трамп журналистам в среду после прибытия на мероприятие в Центре Кеннеди.\nНесмотря на то, что причины повышенных мер безопасности в регионе остаются неясными, планы по эвакуации появились на фоне эскалации напряженности между Ираном и Израилем, в то время как администрация Трампа продолжает попытки заключить новое ядерное соглашение с Ираном.\nОдин из источников отметил, что министр обороны США Пит Хегсет одобрил добровольный отъезд членов семей военнослужащих из различных мест дислокации на Ближнем Востоке.\n«Безопасность наших военных и их семей остается для нас главным приоритетом, и Центральное командование США внимательно следит за развитием напряженной ситуации на Ближнем Востоке», – добавил представитель.\nГосударственный департамент также готовится отдать приказ об отъезде неосновного персонала из посольств США в Ираке, Бахрейне и Кувейте из-за роста рисков для безопасности в регионе.\nТакже будет издан приказ об отъезде неосновного персонала из консульства США в Эрбиле (Иракский Курдистан), сообщили источники. В то же время представитель иракского правительства отметил, что перемещение персонала не связано с ситуацией безопасности в самой стране.\n«Президент Трамп стремится обеспечить безопасность американцев — как в США, так и за рубежом. В рамках этого обязательства мы постоянно оцениваем уровень необходимого персонала во всех наших посольствах. Исходя из последнего анализа, мы решили уменьшить присутствие нашей миссии в Ираке», — сказал представитель Госдепа, отвечая на вопрос об изменении политики.\nРанее «Апостроф» писал, что Пентагон решил перенаправить американским войскам на Ближний Восток ключевую технологию противодействия дронам, которая была предназначена для Украины — речь идет о подрывниках для ракет, что используются для сбивания российских беспилотников.",
