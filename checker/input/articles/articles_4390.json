    "text": "A business owner has secured a £50,000 investment for his unique football shirt business.Alex Street, a former Grantham College student, appeared on BBC’s Dragons’ Den tonight (Thursday, January 16), seeking investment for his business Mystery Jersey King.The Dragons’ were impressed with his business, which involves him and his team sourcing rare football shirts from across the globe.However, it was Dragon Sara Davies that secured a deal with Alex, offering him £50,000 for a 15% investment in the business, which will reduce to 10% once her initial investment is recouped.Alex, who now lives in South Normanton in Derbyshire, said: “If you don’t shoot, you don’t score.“I was nervous walking into the Den, but I decided to stay true to myself and have fun with it.“I knew my numbers and had rehearsed as much as possible.“Securing backing from Sara Davies - the ‘queen of the north’ - is a dream come true.“She’s the perfect partner to help Mystery Jersey King to the next level.“Our UK success has been incredible, and our next big challenge is cracking the US market.“Since Sara is already a household name stateside, I’m confident we’ll make it happen.”Alex, originally from Clapham, co-founded the business with Jamie King in 2021. It sells high-quality, distinctive shirts to customers through one-off purchases or through a monthly mystery shirt subscription.Sara was impressed by the concept.She said: “Alex is such a character, and his enthusiasm lit up the room the moment he walked in.“His vibrant, eye-catching products immediately grabbed our attention, but what really impressed me was his savvy business sense and the massive potential of his idea.“With an endless supply of unique shirts that sport and fashion fans adore, Mystery Jersey King has global appeal.“I’m thrilled to join Alex on this journey and can’t wait to help scale the business.”Alex and Jamie plan to use the investment to optimise operations at their East Midlands headquarters and boost their buying power.",

    "title": "Five principles resonate today, say British experts",
    "text": "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, a foreign relations concept proposed by the Chinese leadership 70 years ago, still resonate today, providing a fundamental framework for building peace and advancing economic cooperation, British experts said.\nThe five principles — mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence — were put forward by the Chinese leadership in the 1950s as a guideline for handling bilateral relations with other nations.\nKeith Bennett, an international relations analyst and co-editor of Friends of Socialist China platform, said: \"A key test of the correctness or otherwise of a set of principles is whether or not they stand the test of time. Over the past 70 years, the five principles have only become more relevant and necessary.\"\nBennett said the virtue and necessity of the principles can be seen in the tragedies in Iraq, Afghanistan and above all today's Gaza that result from a failure of relevant parties to uphold them while pursuing an alternative course.\nThe five principles are in turn embodied and further developed in the important global initiatives put forward by China with regard to security, development and civilization, said Bennett. He added that the initiatives address the key questions and imperatives of peace and development, advance the correct and realistic ways to tackle the existential threats facing humanity, such as nuclear war, climate catastrophe and collapsing biodiversity, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\nHugh Goodacre, a lecturer in the History of Economic Thought at University College London and managing director of the Institute for Independence Studies, said that reading the five principles, one is irresistibly reminded of the Bandung Conference in 1955 when these principles were further developed and agreed upon by the leaders of other developing countries.\n\"It is among the most successful contributions of the older generation of socialist China's leaders to world peace and international respect and friendship,\" he said, adding that China's leaders today continue to emphasize those principles for the well-being of peoples of all countries, each of which is entitled to choose its own path and methods.\nJack Perry Junior, chairman of the 48 Group Club and CEO of London Export Corporation, said the principles could be applied not only in handling foreign relations but also in international business.\nPerry's grandfather was a pioneer businessman who led the first British business delegation to the newly founded People's Republic of China in the early 1950s. He listened to China's leaders laying the foundation for a relationship built on mutual respect and understanding.\n\"Following in my grandfather's footsteps, my father devoted his entire adult life to deepening our understanding of China. He witnessed firsthand the transformation of China from abject poverty to a modern, developing nation,\" said Perry.\n\"Today, as the chairman of the 48 Group, I am committed to continuing this legacy. I will strive to understand China without prejudice, learning from the examples set by my grandfather and father. Our mission remains to bridge the gap between the West and China, fostering mutual growth and understanding.\"\nIn business cooperation, people should embrace different cultures with open minds and reject bias stemming from different ideologies, he said.\n\"Peaceful coexistence is the path forward. It is essential for nations, regardless of their wealth, to work together toward a future where war is obsolete. We envision a world where international cooperation eradicates poverty and promotes peace and prosperity,\" said Perry.",

    "text": "Donald Trump’s son Barron Trump is following suit by dabbling into the real estate business. Barron is Trump’s youngest son who he shares with his wife Melania . The 18-year-old is reportedly getting ready to launch his own Luxury real estate venture.\nBarron is currently a student at New York University where he started studying in September. For years, Melania has reportedly tried her best to keep her only son away from the public eye. The 18-year-old is attending the Stern School of Business currently.\nBarron made headlines after he made a rare appearance at his father’s inauguration ceremony. Trump acknowledged his “very tall son” during his Inauguration speech. A video showed Barron standing up as the crowd went wild as they cheered for him.\nBarron Trump is now set to relaunch his Luxury real estate venture. The business was called Trump, Fulcher & Roxburgh Capital Inc. and was initially started in July of 2024. The company was officially dissolved post Trump’s election win on November 2o24.\nBarron Trump shaking hands with Biden and Harris is a very classy act. pic.twitter.com/33cbx4HLui\n— Kimberly Ross (@SouthernKeeks) January 20, 2025\nOne of Barron’s partners in the venture is his former, high-school classmate Cameron Roxburgh. “As of now, the company will not be relaunched,” Roxburgh had told Fox News in November.\nThe business venture’s primary interest is golf courses and other properties. They were mostly based in Utah, Arizona and Idaho. Business records state Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach to be the principal address for the company.\nIn a different interview with Newsweek , Cameron Roxburgh revealed that the company was dissolved to avoid election-related media attention. The second partner in the venture is Carter Fulcher who is a luxury real estate expert. Fulcher’s family owns an Idaho-based real estate firm.\nCute selfie with Barron and Eric Trump pic.twitter.com/zB5HUPrGsU\n— FLOTUS Report (@MELANIAJTRUMP) January 21, 2025\nCarter is also related to Congressman Russ Fulcher. Roxburgh told the New York Post that they are currently “working out logistics” and “might relaunch” the company in the Spring of this year.\nRoxburgh also confirmed that Donald Trump is not investing in the business venture. He also revealed that Barron is receiving some “private advice” related to the business from his father.\nThe advice seems to be well received in the father-son dynamic. During his Inauguration speech, Trump mentioned how Barron helped him with planning his Presidential campaign. The Republican revealed how his son helped him secure the youth vote because he “understood the market.”\nMelania has also previously credited her son for providing her husband with great political insights. She told Fox News how he has been “very vocal… he brought in so many young people.”\nTrump’s senior advisor Jason Miller also had only good things to say about the 18-year-old. “Hats off to the young man,” he gave props to Barron in an interview with Sky News. “Every single recommendation he’s had has turned out to be absolute ratings gold,” he continued the praise.\nTrump’s other sons Eric and Donald Trump Junior have been actively involved in the family real estate empire. The two took over the charge of the business in 2017 when Trump was in office for the first time.",
