    "text": "Another complaint was filed with the investigation agency of the International Crimes Tribunal yesterday against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina accusing her of committing crimes against humanity and genocide during the people's uprising. She was also accused in two more murder cases filed yesterday with two Dhaka courts. The complaint at the International Crimes Tribunal was filed by Muhammad Sanaullah, a resident of Baro Roypara area of Munshiganj's Gazaria. The complaint said Sanaullah's son Mehedi was killed during student protests near Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Narayanganj on July 20. Eight others accused in the complaint are Obaidul Quader, Awami League general secretary and former road transport minister; Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, former home minister; Zunaid Ahmed Palak, former state minister for telecommunications and IT; Mohammad Ali Arafat, former state minister for information; Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, former inspector general of police; Harun Or Rashid, former additional commissioner (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP); Habibur Rahman, former DMP commissioner; and Harun Ar Rashid, former director general of Rab. Investigation of this complaint and the one filed on Wednesday will be held simultaneously, Ataur Rahman, deputy director (admin) of the investigation agency, told The Daily Star last night. Once the probe is done, the agency will submit the report to the Chief Prosecutor's Office of the tribunal so that the next procedures can begin. On Wednesday, Supreme Court lawyer Gazi MH Tamim filed a similar complaint on behalf of Bulbul Kabir, father of Alif Ahmed Siam, a 9th grader who, as per the complaint, was shot dead by police in Savar. The Hasina-led government in March 2010 formed the International Crimes Tribunal to try those who committed crimes in 1971. One of yesterday's two murder cases against Hasina was filed by Tejgaon resident Abdullah Abu Sayeed Bhuiyan who accused Hasina and 15 other named and several unnamed people of killing Jobaid Hossain Imon, 12, in the capital's Mohammadpur on July 19. The complaint said the boy was shot dead by police during the protests for reforming quotas in government jobs. The case was filed with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Rajesh Chowdhury. The other accused are Obaidul Quader, former ministers Asaduzzaman, Anisul, Tajul Islam, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Hasan Mahmud and Mohammad A Arafat, former private industry affairs adviser to the prime minister Salman F Rahman, former lawmaker Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, former IGP Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, former Rab DG Harun, former DMP commissioner Habibur, former additional IGP Kh Mahid Uddin, former DB chief Harun, former DMP joint commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker, and several unnamed Rab members. After a hearing, the magistrate recorded the complainant's statement and directed the officer-in-charge of Mohammadpur Police Station to register the complaint as a first information report (FIR), said Nur Alam, an employee of the court. Sher-e-Bangla Nagar resident Abul Kalam filed the other case accusing Hasina, 10 named, and several unnamed others of killing Shahabuddin, 35, in the capital's Agargaon on August 5. The case was filed with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Faraha Diba Chanda. The other accused are Quader, Asaduzzaman, Anisul, Hasan Mahmud, Arafat, Salman, Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, Habibur Rahman, Harun Or Rashid (DB) and Biplob Kumar Sarker. The magistrate recorded the complainant's statement and directed the officer-in-charge of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station to register the complaint. The previous government fell after Hasina on August 5 fled to India amid a mass uprising that began as a student protest for reforming quotas in government jobs. Over 550 people, including students and law enforcers, were killed in violence during the uprising.",

Ara, aquesta visió es pot encara millorar des dels 20 miradors que es posen a disposició dels visitants. Turisme Cerdanya ha impulsat un projecte de molta ambició que busca posar en valor els paisatges singulars de la comarca i, alhora, fomentar el turisme sostenible.\nPer contemplar el territori res millor que fer-ho des de les altures. Per aquesta raó, el projecte inclou la identificació i promoció de 20 punts d’observació que es reparteixen per diversos espais. Són miradors que es posen a disposició del visitant per viure una activitat diferent. Aquest projecte es finança amb el que s’ha recaptat de la taxa turística. El visitant podrà viure una experiència única i connectar amb la natura i el patrimoni paisatgístic. A la web de Turisme Cerdanya es pot consultar un mapa interactiu on es localitzen tots els miradors mitjançant Google Maps, recollint de manera visual la informació detallada a cada espai. El projecte de posada en valor dels miradors de la Cerdanya reafirma l’aposta de la comarca per un turisme respectuós amb el medi ambient i accessible per a tothom. \"Volem que qualsevol persona, independentment de les seves capacitats, pugui disfrutar dels paisatges únics que ofereix la Cerdanya\", expliquen des de Turisme Cerdanya. Així, la comarca busca consolidar la seva oferta de turisme de natura i posicionar-se com un exemple de turisme sostenible i inclusiu, promovent el respecte i la conservació del patrimoni natural\", afirmen.\nEl projecte no s’acaba aquí. Segons informen els promotors d’aquesta iniciativa, entre les futures accions que es portaran a terme destaquen la \"instal·lació de taules d’observació en relleu amb plaques QR que permetran l’accés a continguts auditius en quatre idiomes (català, castellà, anglès i francès), cosa que també permetrà a les persones invidents visualitzar el paisatge de l’entorn; i la millora de l’accessibilitat per a persones amb mobilitat reduïda. També es duran a terme actuacions per garantir la seguretat i confort dels visitants i també la instal·lació de baranes i la reparació de passos\".\n-\nNoves relacions afectivesParelles sèniors que viuen separades, el model LAT en auge: «Conservo la meva llibertat i no discuteixo pel comandament de la tele» -\nEntre Vila-real i l’HospitaletCau un clan familiar que es va apropiar de 19 vehicles d’alta gamma d’un servei de subscripció conegut com ‘el netflix dels cotxes’ -\nComerçLa batuda en súpers 24 hores va detectar una vintena d’infraccions laborals -\nSi compres per Shein, Temu o Amazon, atent a la nova estafa del paquet -\nL’estratègia comunitàriaTusk crida al rearmament d’Europa i critica la política migratòria de la UE",

    "text": "Written shortly after the end of the 1984-85 miners' strike, this letter gives some details of the international solidarity efforts carried out via the Direct Action Movement.\nDear Comrades/Sisters and Brothers,\nFirst of all England is subject to creeping Tory fascism. Not only have we seen the once mighty Mineworkers Union fall victim to Thatcher’s policies but now we have more stringent laws against trade unionism, picketing, etc. There is a new Public Order Bill coming up which provides for up to 10 years in prison for riotous behaviour. Since the defeat of the miners, a depression seems to have engulfed our movement. In Britain, though there is more class consciousness than in North America, it’s at a pretty low ebb, which is why the organized working class watched the miners stoned into submission without lifting a finger or striking a blow.\nWe in the Direct Action Movement were pretty active with the miners’ strike, collecting funds, helping on picket lines, etc. Consequently anarcho-syndicalism (anarchism) got a good name with the miners who were sick of the so-called “Left” who only pushed their particular brand of “bossism.” The international anarcho-syndicalist unions in Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, Holland and Italy were all acting in solidarity, sending money, providing holidays for miners’ kids, organizing tours for miners delegations etc., all without the support of the Mineworkers/MUM bureaucracy.\nFinally can I add a plea to the members of SRAF to please write letters describing political events, opinions, etc. and not person trivia? Everyone has personal problems and gripes but the pages of our anarchist federation bulletin is not the place for them.\nI suggest the SRAF editorial people exercise a discreet censorship (dare I say it?) and refuse to print personal trivia which has no bearing on the political arena. Either SRAF continues to act as a talking shop for uncommitted loonies (not all) or else it becomes a viable anarchist federation with all that entails. So to make censorship unnecessary I beg the comrades to act responsibly (as Durruti would say) and submit only genuine political letters.\nI’ll send a donation to the long-suffering SRAF editors as soon as finances allow. In the meantime, yours in love and struggle,\nPete Ridley\nSalud y Anarquia\nFrom: SRAF Bulletin 91 (Nov.-Dec 1985) [Thanks to the comrades at CIRA]",

    "text": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes [will shift away from military commanders](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190731402/military-code-sexual-assault-biden-gillibrand) to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's [Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military](https://www.sapr.mil/sites/default/files/public/docs/reports/AR/FY22/DOD_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military_FY2022.pdf) showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3627334/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-offices-of-special/), Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the [National Institute of Military Justice](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nimj.org/__;!!Iwwt!UbPCvSmbGISuvrCLw1BPxxJS6qOL83gyaz8yBDSEXfcqUNpX0M2GK3oeNrdji2ifc4zOhakHQBUDl2_hTJPlMVGkag$), said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will still be handled by those in the chain of command who are no longer trusted to decide whether to charge murder or rape. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias, then this is all for naught.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.
