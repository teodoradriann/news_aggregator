A parking building pays for itself. To take advantage that are of a weak medical pun, it is a no-brainer. Irrrve never understood why hospitals just don’t go and establish a new carpark building. A parking building in taking out itself then doesn’t would need to come from the ‘vote health’ at what. Yet one of the biggest gripes about hospitals is often a lack of parking management system. I do believe that should you have to charge for parking and gave everyone what pleases parking on-site, as public, patient or staff, then demand would fit inventory. The by-product is increased revenue and consume good by-product to may have. To develop an accurate budget, start by researching the various options available in the market and compare their costs against the features they offer.

    "text": "Politics & Real Estate · Transportation New York City Real Estate Joins Chorus of Criticism Toward Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause By Mark Hallum June 6, 2024 5:28 pm reprints New York Governor Kathy Hochul with MTA chair Janno Lieber to the left. Photo: Adam Gray/Getty Images\nGov. Kathy Hochul is jumping over dollars to pick up dimes it seems with the recent decision to shelve New York’s almost decade-in-the-making congestion pricing program.\nWhile New Yorkers have dreamed of a congestion toll for Manhattan since at least Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, the iteration that Hochul paused at the zero-hour on Wednesday had been in the works since the great transit meltdown of 2017 and had at least $550 million already invested.\nSEE ALSO: Gymshark Playing Its First Away Game in U.S. With New SoHo Office With the tolling cameras above entry points to Manhattan below 60th Street now peering over the streets with lifeless eyes, real estate industry leaders may be refraining from the advocates hurling terms like “ coward ” and “ betrayal ” at the governor, but the pause is far from what they wanted.\n“Congestion pricing will provide environmental and transportation benefits that will make New York City more competitive on the national and international stage,” the Real Estate Board of New York said in a statement. “Any delay in its implementation should be of a limited duration.”\nOthers in real estate — which has generally supported congestion pricing before — haven’t been as outright with their opinions on Hochul’s delay. Gabe Marans, vice chairman at Savills North America, said it’s too early to tell if congestion pricing’s pause will be detrimental to the region economically, but the fact that a portion of commuters drive into Manhattan for work — small though it may be — is something to consider.\nBefore you can reduce congestion, you have to give people access to safe mass transit and the state doesn’t seem to be able to provide that until they have a stable funding stream for improvements, Marans told Commercial Observer.\nIn a pre-taped video, Hochul claimed congestion pricing would hurt low-income commuters and damage Manhattan’s recovery from the pandemic. A more believable excuse for onlookers is based on an initial report from Politico , stating that the delay was more politically driven toward helping Democrats retake a majority in Congress at the behest of U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who has denied playing a part .\nTo make up the estimated $1 billion congestion pricing was expected to funnel into the state coffers, Hochul instead proposed increasing the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on businesses within New York City, according to The New York Times . That’s something government watchdog group Reinvent Albany believes isn’t a solid replacement for congestion pricing and could hurt workers as well. State lawmakers also don’t seem keen on it and indicated they would kill the proposal, Politico reported.\nHochul has also pinned the decision to pause the toll in Manhattan’s central business district (CBD) on not wanting to impact companies mandating return-to-office for employees.\nThe Regional Plan Association, another organization advocating for congestion pricing to proceed, crunched some 2023 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and found that 26 percent of commuters from Hudson Valley drive into the CBD, while 24 percent of Long Islanders would have to pay the toll. Seventeen percent of commuters from New Jersey are motorists versus 12 percent from Connecticut and 10 percent from within the city.\nGovernment watchdog group Reinvent Albany believes the PMT increase, which would require a seemingly unlikely majority vote from Albany lawmakers, isn’t a solid replacement for congestion pricing and could hurt workers as well.\n“We remind the Legislature that the Long Island Rail Road is getting 10 percent, or $1.5 billion, and Metro-North Railroad is also getting $1.5 billion from congestion pricing as part of the 2020-2024 capital plan,” Reinvent Albany said in a statement. “It is absurd to ask only NYC employers — who will pass this on to employees –—to foot the bill for them.”\nIn the process of trying to help Democrats win on the national stage, Hochul has gathered support for her decision from people and organizations that may not be the most desirable for a Democrat, such as a mostly conservative New York City Police Department union, the Police Benevolent Association, and former President Donald Trump .\nFrom a political standpoint, Hochul’s decision seems on shaky ground. From an economic perspective, it looks even shakier.\n“This decision is misguided,” Rick Geddes, a professor of economics at Cornell University, said in a statement. “Gov. Hochul’s decision is disastrous to both the city and the broader economic region since the benefits of free-flowing traffic and faster commutes outweigh the costs.\n“Some cite concerns about ‘equity’ associated with congestion pricing, but traffic congestion itself disproportionately hurts the poor, with city buses and other public transportation stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic.”\nThe toll structure — $15 per day fee for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street and $24 or $36 per day for trucks — was determined by the Traffic Mobility Review Board that was composed of public servants who had immense track records in the real estate industry.\nIt included Carl Weisbrod, the former head of the New York Department of City Planning and senior adviser at HR&A Advisors, REBNY President Emeritus John Banks, Velez Organization President Elizabeth Velez, and Kathryn Wylde, the president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City.\nWylde’s organization criticized the delay, pointing out that taxes on businesses account for 44 percent of MTA revenues and 27 percent comes from riders, while only 13 percent from drivers — “an inequitable allocation that congestion pricing would have helped correct,” the Partnership for New York City said in a statement.\n“Congestion pricing spread the MTA funding burden equitably across all the constituencies that benefit from the mass transit system that supports the tri-state regional economy,” the group added. “The PMT burden is entirely on New York City, which is already the most highly taxed city in the country.”\nMark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com .\nKeywords: Gabe Marans , Kathy Hochul , Metropolitan Transportation Authority , Real Estate Board of New York , Regional Plan Association , Savills",

    "text": "Bhubaneswar: The objective behind celebrating Wildlife Week is to create widespread awareness for protection, conservation and growth of wildlife and their habitats, Forest, Environment and Climate Change Minister Ganesh Ram Singh Khuntia said at the 70th State Wildlife Week celebration here Thursday. “On this occasion, we should remember our commitment to protect the wildlife. ‘Jibe Daya’ (Compassion to Animals) is the basic mantra of our ancient culture and tradition. Human society and wildlife are intimately connected. This natural balance is essential for the survival of human society,” said the minister.\n“Around 36.21 per cent of the state’s geographical area has forest cover, compared to the national average of 24 per cent. The numbers indicate a tangible proof of the state’s strong initiatives towards the protection and conservation of wildlife, forests and environment,” he said. “Our rich biodiversity inhabits more than a thousand species of plants, 14 species of mammals, 537 species of birds, 29 species of amphibians and 129 species of reptiles,” he added. The minister said, “It is very important to create awareness among students and youth generating interest and curiosity by which massive deforestation and environmental damage can be prevented.”\nOn the occasion, Siddharth Pati and Sailendra Narayan Satpathy were conferred with the state-level Biju Patnaik Wildlife Conservation Award and a sum of `1 lakh. The minister also launched two new applications– ‘PRAHAR’- State Wildlife Crime Database Management Portal and ‘SARPA’, rescue and rehabilitation of snakes found in human settlements.",

    "title": "Geomagnetic storm makes Northern Lights aurora visible in areas of Tri-State",
    "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- A \"severe\" solar storm made the northern lights visible across the Tri-State and farther south across the U.S. than usual thanks to a geomagnetic storm. The forecast hinted at faint colorful displays in Canada and northern U.S. cities Thursday night and into Friday morning -- including in New York City and other parts of the Tri-State area. Viewers in New Jersey shared their view of the auroras on Thursday night. Viewers also were able to see the Northern Lights in parts of New York including Hampton Bays and Brooklyn. A fast-moving coronal mass ejection (CME) -- a powerful burst of magnetized plasma from the sun's corona -- erupted from the sun on Tuesday night, prompting NOAA's Space Prediction Center to issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch, indicating \"detrimental impacts\" to critical technology and possible widespread voltage control problems, according to NOAA. The CME was expected to cause a moderate solar storm here on Earth on Thursday and Friday, according to NOAA. A solar, or geomagnetic, storm occurs when the charged particles within solar wind interact with Earth's magnetic field, causing a significant disturbance, according to NASA. One of the most common manifestations of a CME's impact on Earth are the emergence of aurora borealis, or northern lights. The interaction between the CME and Earth's magnetic field, or magnetosphere, creates ribbons of light in the far northern skies that glow green, pink and other colors The stronger the solar storm, the father south the northern lights can be seen. But the farther south you go, a more reddish hue is visible rather than green, because the curvature of the Earth causes the particles to interact higher in the atmosphere. NOAA ranks geomagnetic storms on a five-point scale, with those rated G5, the strongest, being capable of widespread voltage control problems that could lead to power blackouts or even the complete collapse of some power grid systems. In this scenario, auroras could possibly be seen as far south as Florida and southern Texas. NYC Emergency Management had said it is monitoring the potential severe geomagnetic storm that may impact New York City on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11. Intense geomagnetic storms can also bombard Earth with subatomic particles, potentially disrupting navigation systems by interfering with radio and GPS signals and electric power networks, according to NOAA. Geomagnetic storms can also add energy to currents in Earth's magnetic field that can increase distribution of density in the upper atmosphere and cause extra drag on low-orbiting satellites. Everyday life is typically not severely affected, and power grids are equipped to handle slight disruptions to anomalous activity on high-voltage transmission lines, Shawn Dahl, coordinator for NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, told ABC News earlier this year. Last month, the northern lights display stretched as far south as Arizona, Mississippi and Texas. Earlier this week, aurora borealis could be seen in Alaska. This busy series of northern lights activity will soon come to a peak as the sun reaches its solar maximum stage in the coming months. Every 11 years, the sun's magnetic field reaches its solar maximum, in which the number of solar flares is at its highest, according to NOAA. Earth is currently approaching the peak of Solar Cycle 25, in which more sunspots with intense magnetic activity are expected. Impactful space weather events are possible throughout 2024, with the current cycle expected to peak between November 2024 and March 2026, according to NOAA.
