    "text": "Study: Adding pets may slow type of cognitive decline of people older than 50 and living alone Study: Adding pets may slow type of cognitive decline of people older than 50 and living alone (CNN) — People older than 50 living alone may be able to counter decline in their verbal cognition by adding a pet to their home, according to a new study. Losing the ability to easily find words and understand others are early signs of dementia, [research has found.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4335728/#:~:text=Language%20proficiency%20is%20affected%20both,debilitating%20aspects%20of%20cognitive%20decline.) “Pet ownership may completely offset the effect of living alone on cognitive decline,” said study coauthor Dr. Ciyong Lu, professor of epidemiology and medical science and associate dean of the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China. However, the study could only show an association, not direct cause and effect, said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study. “It’s more accurate to say MAY slow down (cognitive decline) and that more prospective studies including a randomized controlled trial would be needed to make more definitive conclusions,” Isaacson said in an email. “One caution I would say is that if a person who lives alone already has cognitive impairment, or physical limitations such as balance or vision problems, it wouldn’t generally be advisable for that person to adopt a pet to slow down their brain aging,” he added. Caring for a pet, especially a puppy or kitten, is a lot of work for anyone, Isaacson said. “Having cognitive decline makes it harder to responsibly care for a pet without help, and the person may be at higher risk of falling if they have trouble with balance or vision at baseline when walking and playing,” he said. Health impact of living alone Living alone has been linked to increased anxiety and depression, especially if it follows the death of or divorce or separation from a partner, [according to studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9714444/) A [2022 study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.954857/full) found living alone, compared to living with others, increased the risk of depression by 42%. Depression, in turn, can double the risk of developing dementia, [scientists have discovered](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/july/dementia-twice-as-likely-in-individuals-with-depression#:~:text=Of%20those%20with%20a%20depression,dementia%20diagnosis%20later%20in%20life.); a [2020 commission](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext) named late-life depression as one of 12 major risk factors for dementia. The study, [published Tuesday](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.49241?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=122623) in the journal JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from people age 50 and older participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who lived with pets. Researchers analyzed answers to an abbreviated word test about animals which “assesses the person’s ability to pay attention to the words, encode the words, and recall them later,” Isaacson said. Pet ownership was associated with slower rates of decline in an overall score of verbal cognition, verbal memory and fluency if a person lived alone, but not if they lived with other people. The reason for that is unclear, Lu said. “This test evaluates elements of attention, working memory, and short-term memory, for example,” he said. “While the results were statistically significant, the magnitude of the effects were not large for verbal memory — one half of a word (point) for the 20-point verbal memory task.” However, there was a one word, or point, difference for verbal fluency, which was more significant, Isaacson said, between people living with only pet companionship compared to people living alone. How living with pets may help While more research needs to be done, there are a number of reasons having a pet such as a dog, cat, fish, bird or the like may reduce the risk of cognitive decline, Lu said. “First, the companionship provided by pets can reduce loneliness and increase well-being,” Lu said, adding that “watching pets can help people calm, relax, and relieve stress and anxiety.” In addition, pets can provide owners with opportunities to meet new people and have conversations and while taking walks, such as with a dog, Lu said. In fact, pet owners had a lower social isolation score than non-pet owners, according to the study. Good quality sleep can play a key role as well. A [2023 study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.3889?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamaneurol.2023.3889) found each percentage decrease in slow-wave sleep per year was linked with a 27% increased risk of developing dementia and a 32% higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. “Pet owners fall asleep more easily than non-pet owners. For example, dog owners often walk their dogs before bedtime, which may have a relaxing effect on the owners and make it easier for them to fall asleep,” Lu said. Some pets require specialized food, habitat and veterinary care, which can provide a sense of meaning and purpose for their owners, Lu said. In addition, by feeding and grooming a pet, owners also engage in more physical activity, often in nature. [Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913501/) have found that [communing with nature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548093/) can boost the immune system, promoting better heath. “Compared with non-pet owners, pet owners take more moderate and vigorous physical activity,” Lu said.

    "text": "Las predicciones indican que las nevadas podrían superar las de inviernos recientes. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El mes de enero de 2025 podría traer condiciones invernales excepcionalmente frías y extremas en Nueva York , según informes meteorológicos recientes. El Servicio Nacional de Meteorología (NWS, por sus siglas en inglés) y Accuweather señalan que las temperaturas podrían ser las más bajas en más de una década, acompañadas de posibles tormentas de nieve significativas . WGNA informa que este invierno contrasta con el anterior, que fue inusualmente cálido, mientras que este año ha comenzado con un frío considerable.\nDatos del NWS muestran que, en diciembre de 2023, la temperatura promedio en Albany fue de -1,6 °C (29,1 °F), 1,3 grados por debajo del promedio histórico. En Glens Falls , la temperatura media fue de -3,4 °C (25,9 °F), lo que representa una diferencia de 0,7 grados respecto a la media habitual. Estas cifras apuntan a un inicio de invierno más riguroso de lo esperado.\nSegún Accuweather, este enero podría estar marcado por una “explosión ártica” que afectará al Medio Oeste, Sur y Este de Estados Unidos , con posibilidad de nieve e hielo en las primeras semanas del mes. “Este patrón de frío amargo podría ser el enero más frío en más de una década y quizás estar salpicado de tormentas invernales”, destaca el medio. Las condiciones actuales en la región favorecen nevadas significativas, lo que podría alterar la rutina diaria en varias áreas.\nLas autoridades instan a extremar precauciones ante las bajas temperaturas. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Cambios drásticos en el clima y la amenaza de nevadas históricas En los primeros días de enero, Albany y otras áreas de la región capitalina de Nueva York ya han comenzado a experimentar un descenso notable en las temperaturas. Accuweather, citado por WGNA , explica que “el frío ártico se asentará durante la primera semana completa de enero y el patrón será propicio para tormentas que traerán nieve o mezclas invernales”. Se espera que este patrón climático provoque acumulaciones mayores de nieve, en contraste con los inviernos recientes, que han sido relativamente suaves.\nWGNA recoge las declaraciones de expertos que sugieren que este año podría producirse una gran nevada , algo que no se ha registrado en los últimos inviernos en Albany. Esta perspectiva genera expectativas entre los residentes, pero también conlleva preocupaciones relacionadas con la movilidad y la seguridad en las vías de comunicación.\nHistóricamente, la región ha sido testigo de inviernos extremos y periodos de bajas nevadas. El NWS recuerda que el invierno 2011-2012 fue uno de los menos nevados , con solo 59,18 cm (23,3 pulgadas) de nieve acumulada. El invierno de 1912-1913 ostenta el récord más bajo, con apenas 35,05 cm (13,8 pulgadas). Sin embargo, las proyecciones para enero de 2025 apuntan a un invierno que podría inclinarse hacia el extremo opuesto, con olas de frío intensas y nevadas significativas.\nLas primeras semanas del mes podrían traer fuertes precipitaciones de nieve. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Récords históricos de frío en Albany y el desafío del invierno severo Albany ha experimentado temperaturas extremas en diversos momentos de su historia. WGNA recuerda que, desde 1874, l as 12 fechas más frías registradas en la ciudad, salvo una, han ocurrido durante enero . El 19 de enero de 1971 sigue siendo el día más frío registrado, con una temperatura mínima de -33,3 °C (-28 °F). Otros episodios destacados incluyen el 5 de enero de 1904 y enero de 1968, cuando el frío extremo afectó gravemente a la región.\nAnte la posibilidad de que este enero se acerque a esos récords históricos, las autoridades y los residentes están tomando medidas preventivas . Las condiciones actuales sugieren que podrían producirse días con temperaturas por debajo de los -20 °C (-4 °F), lo que incrementa la necesidad de vestimenta adecuada y precauciones adicionales.\nEl invierno podría alcanzar niveles de frío no registrados en más de una década. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Impacto del clima extremo en la vida diaria y las previsiones a futuro Los expertos de Accuweather advierten que el patrón de frío prolongado podría afectar no solo las actividades cotidianas, sino también la infraestructura y los servicios básicos. “El patrón favorecerá que las precipitaciones se acumulen como nieve en lugar de registrarse simple lluvia”, señaló WGNA . Esta situación podría representar un alivio para los entusiastas del invierno, pero también plantea desafíos logísticos para las autoridades locales y los servicios de emergencia.\nLa historia climática de Albany muestra que los periodos de frío extremo pueden derivar en complicaciones adicionales, como interrupciones en el transporte, cierres de carreteras y un aumento en los accidentes . Las autoridades recomiendan a la población estar preparada y seguir las actualizaciones meteorológicas para evitar riesgos innecesarios.\nA medida que avance el mes, los meteorólogos seguirán monitoreando las condiciones para prever posibles tormentas y alertar a los residentes con la mayor antelación posible. Las proyecciones indican que este invierno podría consolidarse como uno de los más rigurosos en los últimos años , lo que marcaría un cambio significativo respecto a las temporadas recientes.",

Oxígeno que ha tenido que continuar suministrándose también hoy.\nAdemás, añadía que “los análisis de sangre realizados hoy también revelaron trombocitopenia (plaquetas en sangre en cantidad inferior a lo normal), asociada a la anemia, que requirió la administración de transfusiones de sangre”.\nJubileo\nMientras tanto, en el Vaticano continúan los actos del Jubileo, y hoy se celebrará el dedicado a los diáconos, y en sustitución del papa Francisco, oficiará la misa en la basílica de San Pedro el pro-prefecto del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella.\nEl Vaticano también difundió el texto del rezo del Ángelus escrito por el papa, en el que explicó que “continúa con confianza la hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli, siguiendo con los tratamientos necesarios”, y añadió que “el descanso también forma parte de la terapia”.\n”Agradezco de corazón a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me están demostrando y por la dedicación con la que realizan su servicio entre las personas enfermas”, añadió el papa en su mensaje, que, como el domingo pasado, fue difundido sin que se celebrase el Ángelus, para que el pontífice pueda descansar.\n”En estos días me han llegado muchos mensajes de afecto, y me han impresionado especialmente las cartas y dibujos de los niños. ¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de consuelo que he recibido de todo el mundo! Encomiendo a todos a la intercesión de María y les pido que recen por mí”, añadió Francisco.",

    "title": "US to revitalise partnership with allies like India amidst China’s rise: Biden",
    "text": "Washington: The US is standing up against China’s unfair economic practice, standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and revitalising its partnership with allies like India, US President Joe Biden has said. In his last State of the Union address before the November election, Biden said the US wants competition with China, but not conflict. Biden on Thursday told Americans that the country is in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against Beijing. “We are standing up against China’s unfair economic practice, standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait but revitalising our partnership with allies and the Pacific, India. Australia, Japan, South and Korea,” he said. “For years, all I’ve heard from my Republican friends and so many others is that China’s on the rise and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backwards. America is rising,” he said. The US has the best economy in the world, Biden said in his third State of the Union Address to the Congress which was watched by millions of Americans Thursday night. “Since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up. And our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,” he said “I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China’s weapons. Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that,” Biden said. “And we’re in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else for that matter,” said the president in his speech.",
