    "title": "„Schrecklich\": „Gefragt - Gejagt\"-Fans hassen Jägerin zum Staffelstart",
    "text": "Mit einigen Änderungen startete die ARD-Quizshow „Gefragt – Gejagt“ am 23. April. Die TV-Zuschauer wunderten sich zu Beginn über ein Mysterium. Hamburg – Die neue Staffel von „Gefragt – Gejagt“ wurde von Fans sehnsüchtig erwartet. Nachdem die ARD dem verstorbenen Jäger Klaus-Otto Nagorsnik zum Todestag am 22. April gedacht hatte , war zum Auftakt der frischen Folgen nichts mehr von Trübsal zu spüren.\n„Schrecklich“: „Gefragt – Gejagt“-Fans hassen Jägerin zum Staffelstart Statt Trübsal geriet Jägerin Annegret Schenkel bei den Fans in die Schusslinie. Nach der ersten Episode der neuen Staffel am Mittwoch (23. April) halten die TV-Zuschauerinnen und -Zuschauer mit ihren Meinungen auf Facebook und Co. nicht hinter dem Berg. Einige Anhängerinnen und Anhänger der Sendung hassen offenbar die Quizexpertin:\n„Schrecklich diese Jägerin, sofort einen anderen Sender gesucht“ „Nach drei Minuten raus! Die Unsympathischste gleich zu Beginn“ „Kann diese Frau nicht ausstehen, sorry“ „Als die ‚Dame‘ kam, habe ich gleich umgeschaltet“ „Och nö, die mag ich auch nicht“ „Für mich macht sie einen unsympathischen Eindruck“ „Gefragt – Gejagt“ in der ARD kommt mit einigen Neuerungen wieder Es liegt in der Natur der Sache, dass sich auf der anderen Seite viele Fans von „Gefragt – Gejagt“ über Schenkel als Jägerin gefreut haben. Ebenfalls gehört es dazu, dass sich Menschen in den sozialen Medien über Neuerungen jeglicher Art beschweren.\nDie ARD hatte zum Staffelstart bereits ein neues Intro sowie ein neues Logo angekündigt. Fans finden das Intro „ganz nett“ und bewerten es als „marginal aufgefrischt“. Mehr Anklang fand Moderator Alexander Bommes bei den Anhängern. Dieser trug bei den Schnellrunden eine Brille.\nZwar war in den zurückliegenden Staffeln Bommes bereits hin und wieder mit Brille zu sehen, für viele Fans war der Look jedoch neu. „Dem Alex steht die Brille sehr gut“ und „Alex Bommes mit Brille…sexy“ sind nur zwei von etlichen Kommentaren, die dem Moderator schmeicheln.\nGroßes Mysterium um Hexenhut bei „Gefragt – Gejagt“ Zu Beginn der Sendung rätselten Fans jedoch über etwas ganz anderes: Beim Kameraschwenk war im Schatten auf dem Jägerplatz eine Person mit Hexenhut zu sehen. Das Licht war jedoch so abgedunkelt, dass man als TV-Zuschauerin und -Zuschauer keine Möglichkeit hatte zu erkennen, wer da saß.\n„Wer hat den Hut bemerkt?“, fragte die ARD auf den sozialen Medien die „Gefragt – Gejagt“-Fans. Tatsächlich fiel der Hexenhut deutlich auf, doch eine Auflösung des Mysteriums folgte bislang nicht. Folge Nummer zwei der neuen Staffel läuft am Donnerstag (24. April) um 18 Uhr in der ARD – wird die Frage dann beantwortet?",

    "title": "A musical triangle - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "Chinese-American musician Chelsea Guo (right) performs during her debut tour of Chinese cities in December, both as a pianist and vocalist, featuring works by Johannes Brahms, Robert and Clara Schumann. [Photo provided to China Daily] Young pianist's recitals highlight unique friendship between the composers Johannes Brahms and Robert and Clara Schumann, Chen Nan reports.\nWhat do you expect to hear from a young musician's recital? For Chinese-American pianist and soprano Chelsea Guo, whose Chinese name is Guo Ziyao, she offered audiences something rare.\nDuring her first tour in China, which ran from Dec 22 to 31 and visited cities, such as Chengdu in Sichuan province, Wuhan in Hubei province, and Changsha in Hunan province, the 22-year-old musician presented programs centering on the relationship between Johannes Brahms, Robert and Clara Schumann.\nThe Schumann couple were famous musicians during the Romantic period of classical music. In 1853, when Robert Schumann met the promising young composer, Brahms, it marked the establishment of a famous love triangle in classical music history.\nGuo explored this story through music, performing the many compositions they dedicated to one other in her recitals.\n\"The program I put together is truly about the human experience. I have always felt a strong connection to the relationship between Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann and Clara Schumann. Somehow, the love, friendship, and loyalty among these three artists tells an honest story of being human,\" said Guo, following her recital in Beijing, which was staged on Dec 28. \"Many know the famous story of Brahms' unrequited romantic love for Clara, and while the music very possibly reflects that, this set of pieces is really focused on the trio's friendship, specifically how Brahms supported the Schumanns during Robert's mental decline.\"\nThe recital's first half was all piano. According to Guo, Brahms' Variations on an Original Theme, Op 21 No 1 in D Major is one of the most warm and affectionate pieces of music, which is evidence of his deep care for the Schumanns, written shortly after the death of Robert.\nThe piece that followed, Clara Schumann's Three Romances, Op 21, is thought to have been dedicated to Brahms as an expression of her gratitude for his unwavering presence during Robert Schumann's time in psychiatric care, during which the young composer helped look after her and the Schumanns' many children.\nGuo wrapped up the first half of her recital by playing Rachmaninoff's selection from Morceaux de Fantaisie Op 3 (a collection of five piano solo pieces), and though this composer may seem irrelevant to the theme of the recital, the piece offers a different musical perspective of very similar experiences: grief, love, and a clown that cunningly mocks the tragedy of life.\nThe second half was all vocal. After the intermission, Guo took the audience into a world of love songs by Rachmaninoff, followed by Brahms' art songs, and the audience were taken back to the main story.\nRobert Schumann's art song cycle, Frauenliebe und Leben (Woman's Love and Life), Op 42, brought the recital to an end. For female voice and piano, the song cycle was inspired by eight poems by a friend and deals with the trauma of a woman, from losing the man who was her first love to the eventual death of her husband.\nThe recital closed with Robert Schumann's Widmung (Dedication), which was written for Clara as a wedding gift.\n\"Life is often tragic, but beauty, friendship and love are what bring us through,\" notes Guo.\nDespite her young age, Guo has stood out as both a classical pianist and a soprano. As she sees it, being a pianist allows her to express herself in a much quieter way while singing is very different, \"which is about being extroverted\".\n\"They represent different sides of me, both my ways of expression,\" says Guo, who won at the Young Concert Artists International Auditions in 2022 as both pianist and vocalist. The double award was a first in the history of the nonprofit organization, which was founded by Susan Wadsworth in 1961 and has been dedicated to discovering and launching the careers of exceptional, but lesser known, young musicians from all over the world.\nBorn to Chinese parents in New York, Guo learned to play the piano at about 4 years old. Her mother, He Jing, an art enthusiast who learned to play the violin and danced as a child, supported Guo's decision to become a musician.\n\"We told her lots of stories when she practiced the instrument, hoping for her to be creative and express the music with imagination,\" He explains.\nChelsea Guo [Photo provided to China Daily] As for singing, Guo says that she didn't take it seriously and only sang for fun at choirs during her childhood. Her talent for singing was recognized by her music teachers. When she studied in the Juilliard School's Pre-College program, Guo was trained with a double major in piano and classical voice. Since then, she has been developing a career both as a pianist and a soprano.\nShe recently graduated from the Juilliard School with a Bachelor of Music in piano.\n\"A very fine pianist with a beguiling voice. Here is a rare talent,\" said BBC Music Magazine upon the 2021 release of Guo's debut recording Chopin: In My Voice, featuring interpretations of a range of Chopin's piano compositions augmented by performances of several of the composer's art songs, plus an aria by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini in which Guo accompanies herself.\n\"Chopin's music is always close to my heart. In the album's name, the 'voice' means both the voice of the piano and my own,\" says Guo. She made the album when she was preparing for the National Chopin Piano Competition in the United States in 2020, at which Guo won a top prize.\nChelsea Guo [Photo provided to China Daily] As for singing, Guo says that she didn't take it seriously and only sang for fun at choirs during her childhood.

    "title": "TETFund: Redefining Research Culture In Nigeria",
    "text": "In a time when Nigeria’s higher education sector is under pressure to deliver more than just academic credentials, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) is quietly engineering a research renaissance.\nThrough its Research for Impact (R4i) Programme, TETFund is reimagining how research is conducted, not just for academic fulfilment, but for real-world solutions that speak to national development.\nSince its inception, the R4i Programme has mobilised a powerful wave of innovation across Nigeria’s tertiary institutions. LEADERSHIP recently reported that over 152 prototypes have been developed, spanning various sectors, from technology and agriculture to health and education.\nMore impressively, 707 researchers have participated, showcasing the scale and ambition of the initiative.\nBut beyond the numbers lies a deeper transformation which is the shift from theoretical knowledge to actionable impact.\nR4i is not merely about research; it’s about research that works, research that solves, research that delivers. It is a call to action, one that invites Nigeria’s academics to step out of the pages of journals and into the heart of communities.\nAt the recent closing ceremony of the 30th Cohort held at Innov8 Technology Hub in Abuja, participants reflected on what this transformation means not just for the country, but for themselves.\nEngr. Victoria Ada Abodenyi of Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi, captured this sentiment with raw emotion and clarity. “Knowledge, they say, is power. I would add only if you know how to utilise it.\n“For the first time, I saw the gap between problem and solution begin to close.”\nShe continued. “My experience at R4i was nothing short of transformative from the high-level facilitators to the state-of-the-art labs churning out real, functional innovations.”\nHer words revealed a deeper truth that many Nigerian researchers have long been working in silos, producing work that rarely leaves the confines of academia. R4i, in her view, has redefined that paradigm.\n“This is no longer business as usual. Research must be problem-based, giving value to the system and pushing towards commercialisation.”\nFakunle Abayomi of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, shared a similar awakening. A mechatronics enthusiast, Fakunle admitted that much of his past work focused on “proof-of-concept” designs projects that demonstrate functionality, but often stop short of market or societal impact.\n“Arriving at Innov8 Hub felt like stepping into a fever dream. The environment oozed excellence from the facilitators to the engineers. Everyone was focused, creative, and intensely collaborative.”\nFor Fakunle, R4i was not just a training, it was a paradigm shift. “We were taught that research should begin with demand. It should address a need, a gap, a problem. That approach doesn’t just improve the quality of research it makes it matter.”\nDuring the programme, he and his team developed a prototype exercise device, a project that taught him the value of interdisciplinary teamwork and solution-driven engineering. More than just building a device, he began to see how such innovations could scale into sustainable ventures.\n“I am taking back not just a prototype, but a mindset,” he said. “One that insists that research must move beyond the lab, into the world, into lives.”\nThe testimonials from Victoria and Fakunle are only two among hundreds. But they represent the broader impact of R4i: a cultural shift in Nigeria’s research ecosystem from abstract inquiry to applied innovation, from paper to prototype, from idea to impact.\nAs TETFund continues to champion this initiative alongside Innov8 Hub, the message is clear as Nigeria’s researchers are not short on ideas they’ve just needed the right platform to bring those ideas to life.\nAnd with R4i, that platform is here, recalibrating the nation’s academic focus toward relevance, entrepreneurship, and development.",

    "text": "Depois da paralisação de 12 a 27 de março, que contou com uma adesão, em média, de 95% \"ou superior\" em alguns dias, os associados decidiram avançar com novo pré-aviso de greve entre as 03:00 e as 09:00 de 28 de março a 11 de abril, adiantou o Sindicato Independente de Pilotos de Linhas Aéreas (SIPLA).\nNesta faixa horária, a Portugália realiza 28 a 29 voos para a TAP, mas nestes dias \"foram realizados apenas um ou dois\", além da ligação obrigatória entre Lisboa e a Terceira, nos Açores.\nA mesma fonte oficial faz um balanço \"positivo\" e revela que têm decorrido várias reuniões com a administração da TAP, muitas por telefone. Porém, como consideram que \"continua a não haver garantias de estabilidade\", decidiram renovar a paralisação.\n\"Tem havido avanços em algumas matérias, mas quando enviam a redação das propostas vêm alteradas\" face ao que foi falado nos encontros, e \"sem qualquer compromisso concreto que garantisse o futuro dos pilotos da Portugália\", segundo a mesma fonte.\n\"Em apenas um mês, a administração contradisse as próprias afirmações, provando que a única coisa que realmente mudou foi a sua estratégia de desinformação\", lamenta o sindicato.\nO SIPLA revelou ainda que lhes foi transmitido que a TAP iria reduzir a frota da Portugália de 19 para 17 aeronaves, e que não haveria garantias de trabalhadores serem integrados na companhia aérea de bandeira.\nApesar de recentemente a Portugália ter transitado da TAP SGPS para a TAP SA, no âmbito da reprivatização da companhia aérea, \"nada vai mudar\", lamentou o sindicato, acrescentando que \"temem pelo futuro da empresa\" que atualmente emprega quase 900 trabalhadores.\nO sindicato informa também que \"já avançou com a queixa junto da Autoridade da Concorrência portuguesa\" por violação das regras de concorrência no Regulamento do Recurso à Contratação Externa (RRCE), estando a preparar também uma manifestação junto da Direção-Geral da Concorrência Europeia.\nUm dos motivos da insatisfação está precisamente relacionado com o RRCE, criado em 1998, que tinha como objetivo funcionar como um travão à contratação de voos externos pela TAP, incluindo à Portugália que representa a maior fatia, impondo limites que, caso sejam ultrapassados, revertem a favor dos pilotos da TAP através do pagamento de compensações indemnizatórias.\nEste protocolo, usado por várias companhias europeias, originou custos de 60 milhões de euros no ano passado, como resultado do pagamento de seis salários-base extraordinários a cada piloto da TAP, como o Expresso tinha noticiado em maio de 2024.\nOs pilotos da Portugália, que em 2023 realizou cerca de 25% do total de voos da TAP de acordo com o relatório da TAP SGPS, têm vindo a criticar as consequências deste protocolo e defendem que só reforça que é \"considerada uma empresa externa\".\nA direção do SIPLA enviou uma proposta à administração TAP que previa a \"substituição das aeronaves atuais, aquisição de novas aeronaves, garantias laborais, proteção na redução de postos de trabalho devido à diminuição de frota, definição de um número mínimo de aeronaves e a admissão de oficiais pilotos da Portugália na TAP por concurso interno\".\nEm respostas à Lusa, em 12 de março, a TAP informou que \"na impossibilidade de um consenso que permita evitar um protesto cuja razão de ser é de difícil compreensão, a TAP tomou já todas as medidas possíveis para mitigar o efeito desta greve junto dos passageiros\".\nNesse sentido, assegura que a operação iria decorrer com normalidade neste período.\nLeia Também: Greve da Portugália com adesão de 96%.
