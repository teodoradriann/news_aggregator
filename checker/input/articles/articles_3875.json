    "text": "IPSWICH, England - Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter both scored to end Brighton & Hove Albion's run of eight Premier League games without a win as their side beat Ipswich Town 2-0 at Portman Road on Thursday.\nThe victory lifts Brighton to ninth place on 31 points, while Ipswich slip to 17th on 16 and back into the relegation zone behind Wolverhampton Wanderers on goals scored.\nThe hosts started well despite Brighton enjoying plenty of possession and Nathan Broadhead created the first decent chance of the game for Ipswich with a shot from outside the box but Bart Verbruggen got down to steer the ball behind for a corner.\nFive minutes later striker Liam Delap had a go from a similar position but again the Brighton goalkeeper was equal to the task and the Dutchman had to be on his toes again when midfielder Omari Hutchinson let fly just before the break.\nIpswich fullback Wes Burns flashed a shot just wide after a well-worked long throw in the 57th minute but the home side's failure to take their chances finally cost them dear two minutes later when Mitoma struck.\nA sliced clearance fell to Swedish midfielder Yasin Ayari and he cleverly fed Matt O’Riley, who teed up the Japanese winger for a first-time finish.\nWith Ipswich reeling, keeper Christian Walton got a measure of revenge on Brighton's Joao Pedro, who got a yellow card for clattering into him early in the second half, by making a superb save to prevent his 67th-minute shot flying into the top corner.\nBrighton were not to be denied, however, and substitute Rutter fired home form close range in the 82nd to wrap up the three points and end the visitors' long winless run.\n\"It was a long time and we suffered a little bit, and I'm really happy for the players, really happy also for the staff, because they do a lot of work in the shadows, and today, I think we deserve to win, and we're happy,\" Brighton coach Fabian Huerzeler said.\n\"An important thing (during the winless run) was to stay predictable, to stay calm and to trust the process, and I think the performances were not that bad, and we could easily win one of these eight games where we weren't able to win,\" he added.\nBoth sides will be back in action again on Sunday, with Brighton travelling to Manchester United and Ipswich hosting Manchester City.

    "text": "Turkey ready to host summit between Ukraine and Russia to end war, says Erdoğan after meeting with Zelenskiy After meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy in Istanbul, Turkey's President Erdoğan has stated at a press conference that they are ready to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. Reuters Turkey is ready to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on March 8 after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Istanbul. In a meeting lasting about an hour, Erdoğan and Zelenskiy discussed developments in the Ukraine-Russia war, shipping security in the Black Sea including the defunct grain deal, and defence industry cooperation, according to the two sides. NATO member Turkey supports Ukraine's territorial integrity, but also maintains cordial relations with Russia, and regularly speaks with both sides in the conflict, notably as a sponsor of the Black Sea deal that lifted a de facto Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. \"We discussed developments about the war in detail today, I stated our observations with all my sincerity,\" Erdoğan said at a press conference alongside Zelenskiy, whose trip comes before an expected visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin following elections in Russia on March 15-17. \"We are giving our utmost contribution for the war to end on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit that Russia will attend too,\" he said, adding he had reiterated Ankara's support for Ukraine's sovereignty. Turkey had hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, but has since complained that no diplomatic step has been taken to advance these discussions. It has repeatedly offered to host further talks, saying a summit of leaders was needed. Zelenskiy said Russia would not be invited to the first peace summit due to be held in Switzerland in the coming months, but that a Russian representative could be invited to the next meeting after a roadmap for peace had been agreed upon with Ukrainian allies. \"We do not see any representatives of Russia at this summit. We don't see how you can invite people who block, destroy, and kill everything. We want to get a result - a just peace,\" he said. Last week, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said after meeting Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that it was time for Ukraine and Russia to start ceasefire talks, but added that this must not mean the recognition of Russia's occupation. Turkey has provided Ukraine with armed drones and also inked an agreement for their joint production at a factory near Kyiv, but progress has been hindered by the war. It has provided Kyiv with other forms of military support, but opposes the Western sanctions on Russia. After arriving on Friday, Zelenskiy visited a shipyard near Istanbul to inspect construction work on two corvettes for the Ukrainian navy. He later said he had discussed the joint production of some arms and ammunition with Erdoğan. \"Today, we have reached agreements on joint defence projects both at the government level and between companies,\" he said on the social media platform X after meeting Erdoğan. \"I met with the Turkish defence industry representatives. We are prepared to move quickly to put everything we discussed into action,\" he added, without elaborating. Talks also touched on the Black Sea grain deal, which was brokered by Turkey and United Nations and allowed Ukraine to safely export grain from its ports. Ankara has pushed to revive it, but Russia, which said its requests for better terms for its own food and fuel exports were ignored, has said it is not interested. As part of its balancing act, Turkey maintains its defence industry ties with Ukraine while deepening energy cooperation with Russia. It also inked an accord to take part in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. Reuters exclusively reported last month that a U.S. threat to hit financial firms doing business with Russia with sanctions had chilled Turkish-Russian trade, disrupting or slowing some payments for both imported oil and Turkish exports.",

    "text": "As instalações de energia ao longo da Costa do Golfo dos EUA reduziram operações e iniciaram evacuações em antecipação ao Furacão Helene, que deve atingir a costa nordeste do Golfo com força catastrófica na noite de quinta-feira. O Centro Nacional de Furacões prevê que Helene será uma tempestade severa de Categoria 4, com ventos atingindo até 251 quilômetros por hora.\nO Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement informou na quinta-feira que aproximadamente 25% da produção de petróleo bruto e 20% da produção de gás natural no Golfo do México foram interrompidos devido à tempestade. Esta região é responsável por cerca de 15% da produção de petróleo bruto dos EUA, totalizando 1,8 milhão de barris por dia. A interrupção pode potencialmente pressionar os preços domésticos do petróleo e afetar o fornecimento de petróleo dos EUA.\nAs empresas de energia tomaram várias medidas em resposta à ameaça do furacão. Na terça-feira, a Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) fechou seus terminais de granéis na área de Tampa. A Shell (LON:NYSE: SHEL ) começou a evacuar pessoal não essencial de seus ativos no Corredor de Marte no sábado, incluindo as instalações Stones e Appomattox, e interrompeu a produção lá. A Chevron (NYSE:NYSE: CVX ) seguiu protocolos semelhantes, evacuando pessoal e interrompendo a produção em várias plataformas, como Blind Faith, Petronius, Anchor, Big Foot, Jack/St. Malo e Tahiti entre domingo e terça-feira.\nA Equinor começou a evacuar alguns funcionários de sua plataforma de produção de petróleo Titan no domingo. A BP (NYSE:BP) removeu pessoal não essencial de suas plataformas Argos, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Na Kika e Thunder Horse no mesmo dia. A produção em Na Kika e Thunder Horse foi interrompida, com a produção de Argos e Atlantis reduzida. Na terça-feira, a BP estava trabalhando para retomar com segurança a produção em todo o seu portfólio no Golfo do México.\nAs autoridades emitiram fortes advertências, instando os residentes em áreas costeiras a evacuar e se preparar para a poderosa ressaca e ventos. As ações coletivas dessas empresas de energia fazem parte da resposta de emergência padrão para proteger os trabalhadores e minimizar os riscos ambientais durante tais desastres naturais.\nA Reuters contribuiu para este artigo.\nEssa notícia foi traduzida com a ajuda de inteligência artificial.
