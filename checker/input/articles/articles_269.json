    "text": "‘Someone actually cares’: Man gives firsthand account of living unhoused in blistering cold By Grant Stephens Click here for updates on this story KANSAS CITY, Missouri ( KSHB ) — It’s still awfully cold, and that means the need to help people living outside or on the streets is still just as great. A group of KC-metro area volunteers hit the cold streets to help Monday night. Steven, a man who has spent the last few years homeless, said this cold spell has been the worst he’s felt in years. “Oh it’s terrible,” Steve said. “It hurts. You try to go to sleep and you wake up with your feet hurting and your hands hurting and your knees and everything’s so cold and nobody cares. The other night I was in the middle of 12th street just screaming, ‘Somebody help me! I’m freezing!’ I need a ride you know? And nobody stopped. Nobody stopped.” There are hundreds of unhoused people like Steven in dozens of camps across KCMO. “Everybody has a story,” said Shelle West, the founder of Show Me You Care KC. “And everybody’s not homeless or houseless by choice. Sometimes, it’s the last option. Sometimes, this is all they have.” For whatever reason, they’re outside in the cold, a place many believe is their only option. “You can’t even hardly imagine,” Nikki Klein, one of the volunteers said. “I’m constantly in my mind thinking, ‘How do people live like this? How do you literally live outside when it’s below zero.” Klein and other volunteers brought blankets, food, and hand warmers. They do their best to convince people to get treatment for some of their cold-related injuries. Frostbite is common. “The pain in your feet mostly and your hands. Yeah, it’s bad,” Steven said. Coats, socks, fuel – physical things go a long way – but a warm heart takes it further. “We want to show them that we care,” West said. “And that there are people out here that truly care, that won’t ride past them.” It makes all the difference to Steven. “It’s just the love that they show you more than anything, that someone actually cares,” Steven said.

    "text": "«Cari genitori, siete davvero i protagonisti e i primi artefici dell'educazione dei vostri figli, ma tale compito richiede l'aiuto di tutta la società, a cominciare dalla scuola. Un'alleanza forte tra la scuola e le famiglie permette la trasmissione delle conoscenze e al tempo stesso la trasmissione dei valori umani e spirituali», lo afferma papa Francesco nel messaggio inviato ai partecipanti al Congresso dell'Association des Parents d'Eleves del'Enseignement Libre (Apel), che si svolge a Valence, in Francia, dal 31 maggio al 2 giugno 2024. «La via da seguire» «La via da seguire in questo ambito, come in tanti altri, resta quella dell'alleanza, dell'incontro e della collaborazione. Così il vostro impegno di genitori di studenti, al servizio delle nostre comunità educative, si rivela indispensabile, e io vi ringrazio per questo. È uno dei pilastri del Patto educativo globale che vi invito a proporre con entusiasmo», sottolinea il Pontefice.\nFrancesco invita inoltre i genitori a non dimenticare «la funzione pedagogica del tempo! Sapete per esperienza che l'educazione non termina con la fine della scuola: i suoi effetti si manifestano nel corso di tutta la vita, permettendo di accogliere le gioie e le prove che la costellano». Esorta dunque a «fare buon uso del tempo» e «ad affrontare con coraggio le sfide attuali».",

    "title": "Vassar Israel-Hamas war protest: Students, school reach agreement",
    "text": "After five days, Vassar College students took down their encampment on the campus library lawn Saturday, following approximately 13 hours of deliberation with Vassar administration. On Tuesday, April 30, Vassar College students had joined protests happening across the state and nation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war. Some protests locally have led to arrests, including at the campuses of SUNY New Paltz and SUNY Purchase . Vassar Students for Justice in Palestine announced in an Instagram post they would end their encampment through an agreement reached with Vassar administration regarding their demands, but said \"we do not recognize this agreement as a victory.\" The student group said the agreement gives them support \"in pursuing a plan for divestment from weapons and surveillance manufacturers, including those that supply Israel with the materials that carry out the genocide of the Palestinian people.\" The agreement includes an invitation for students to present at an upcoming Trustee Investor Responsibility Committee meeting and the establishment of a group of faculty and students to propose \"curricular innovations around the topics of Peace and Conflict Studies and/or Middle Eastern Studies.\" Both students and administration plan to meet and continue communications to maintain effective working relationships. More: Did SUNY Purchase, New Paltz protest arrests violate free speech protections? In a letter posted on Vassar's website, Vassar President Elizabeth H. Bradley said the college \"will work to improve our understanding, dialogue about, and educational programming concerning peace and conflict, with focus on Gaza and the Middle East.\" Through the encampment, Vassar students said they received $7,000 dollars and supplies to support their efforts. \"We are able to donate all the money we raised directly to families in Gaza and all the supplies will be redistributed to organizations and people in Poughkeepsie,\" students said in an Instagram post. The Vassar campus community, Bradley said, recognizes the growing racism that affects students' experiences and \"is committed to combating all these forms of hatred\" while working toward healing.",
