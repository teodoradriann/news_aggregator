    "text": "SOUTH BEND— Backgrounds in sports other than football clearly impress the Notre Dame recruiting apparatus.\nIn addition to established two-sport college athletes Drayk Bowen (linebacker/baseball), Jordan Faison (wide receiver/lacrosse), Tyler Buchner (wide receiver/lacrosse) and Matt Jeffery (wide receiver/lacrosse), Notre Dame’s 2025 signing class includes a slew of newcomers that can shine in other sports.\nBrandon Logan, the safety/outfielder from Fort Wayne’s Snider High School, was a Vanderbilt baseball commit until Notre Dame came calling.\nJames Flanigan, the tight end from Green Bay, Wisc., won state titles in hockey and track and field.\nOffensive tackle Will Black, the highest-rated recruit in Notre Dame’s 12 th -ranked signing class, grew up in London, Ontario playing hockey, basketball and lacrosse before he outgrew those pursuits. Black now stands 6-foot-7 and 292 pounds.\nAnd cornerbacks Cree Thomas (decathlon) and Mark Zackery IV (basketball) have distinguished themselves in non-football ways.\n“We have some multisport athletes here at Notre Dame,” Irish coach Marcus Freeman said. “We love that. I encourage that. I think it’s something that we put tremendous value in.”\nLast December’s hiring of director of football performance Loren Landow, who has worked with Olympic-class athletes from a variety of sports, has only increased the potential benefits of football-plus athletic backgrounds.\nThose benefits cover everything from the physiological to the psychological, from avoiding injury to playing through various thresholds of pain. Freeman, whose eldest son, Vinny, wrestles and plays football at Penn High School; knows that better than most big-time football coaches.\nMadden 2025: Notre Dame football scores late win for California LB recruit\nFirst-hand knowledge of multisport value At 10, Freeman won an age-group national championship in taekwondo before turning his attention to wrestling and football. At Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio, Freeman competed in track and field in the spring.\n“I think there are movements that playing in different sports can really help you with in football,” Freeman said. “Yes, there’s the basic athleticism, movement traits that different sports give you. But the thing I keep coming back to is that competitive spirit.\nNotre Dame football GM Chad Bowden cites freshman impact on recruiting Notre Dame football general manager Chad Bowden says recruits see a path to playing time when freshmen like Leonard Moore shine for the Irish. “It’s hard to compete sometimes just going to a (football) trainer, and somebody might say, ‘You’re wrong because we compete in our training session.’ But I want to see you go head-to-head in track. I want to see you go head-to-head in baseball. Brandon Logan, I want to see you play baseball, and maybe not just look to specialize in one sport.”\nNewly signed offensive tackles Matty Augustine (hockey) and Owen Strebig (baseball) competed in other spots as did defensive lineman Dominik Hulak (hockey). Receivers Elijah Burress and Antavious “Scrap” Richardson honed their running form as track sprinters; Richardson, in fact, won Georgia state titles in the 100 and 200 meters.\n“I can go down the list about multisport athletes,” Freeman said. “I love multisport guys. It keeps you busy, keeps you in shape.”\nAnd Zackery, like 2024 signee and fellow defensive back Tae Johnson (Fort Wayne North Side) before him, might be as skilled on the basketball court as he is on the football field.\n“(Zackery) is one of the few football players who can truly play basketball,” Freeman said of the Ben Davis High School star from Indianapolis. “Most of our guys that play basketball are football players (who are) just on the basketball court. He’s a basketball player when he’s on the basketball court. He is a unique talent.”\nOn Freeman’s watch, Notre Dame football seems to be collecting those.\nMike Berardino covers Notre Dame football for the South Bend Tribune and NDInsider.com.

    "text": "Jean-Pierre Gey crée des vitraux. Ses créations uniques et colorées sont un symbole de l’artisanat d’art et de son savoir-faire rare. A la force de ses poumons, à la précision de ses mains et avec sa créativité, il façonne des vitraux de verre dans son échoppe de la rue Nationale depuis de nombreuses années.\nDepuis des décennies, cet artisan d’art vit de sa passion. \"On prend un bout de verre et de ce bout de verre, on va créer quelque chose\", explique-t-il. Après un apprentissage du métier chez un orfèvre, Jean-Pierre Gey affiche l’enthousiasme et la passion d’un néophyte malgré le temps qui passe. Et dans son atelier de Gimont, il aide actuellement pour un projet solidaire de terroir autour de l’église d’Aurimont.\nEt à bientôt 75 ans, le verbe et les mains sont encore intacts : \"Ma passion pour les vitraux date de l’adolescence et de l’école des beaux-arts, en 1968. Un ami m’a fait découvrir l’art du vitrail et c’est parti de cela\".\nUn loisir devenu un métier Doué pour le dessin par atavisme familial, le cursus devait être professoral, il sera tout autre à la faveur d’un séjour en Dordogne. Un loisir devenu un métier : \"Après le service militaire, je voulais découvrir le vrai métier, celui des Compagnons. J’ai frappé à la porte des meilleurs maîtres verriers parisiens et la persévérance a payé. Dans le Val-d’Oise, près d’Enghien, j’ai appris chez Jacques Juteau les bases : vitrerie, découpe, dessins sur cartons, la cuisson. Puis, je reviens sur la région Occitanie pour faire du dessin chez les Ducs de Gascogne, puis, plus tard, je me lance dans ma passion\".\nA Aurimont, Jean-Pierre Gey a répondu favorablement à un appel du pied du maire d’Aurimont, Jacques Fauré. Et à la faveur de la réfection de l’intérieur de l’église du village, le projet de mettre de la couleur a été relevé. Une fois le budget validé par le conseil municipal, les idées sont venues et le système D a battu son plein. Une vierge viendra magnifier le tout. L’église retrouve ainsi dès aujourd’hui ses lettres de noblesse.",

    "title": "Israel ready to let ships bring aid to Gaza’s shores – minister",
    "text": "By Dan Williams\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israel is prepared to let ships deliver aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip “immediately” as part of a proposed sea corridor from Cyprus, the Israeli foreign minister said on Sunday, naming four European countries as potential participants.\nUnder the arrangement first suggested by Nicosia in November, cargo would undergo security inspection in the Cypriot port of Larnaca before being ferried to the Gaza coast, 370 km (230 miles) away, rather than through neighbouring Egypt or Israel.\nIf the plan goes ahead, it would mark the first easing of an Israeli naval blockade imposed on Gaza in 2007 after militant Hamas Islamists seized control of the Palestinian enclave.\nIsrael has described the corridor as a means of ending its civilian ties to Gaza, where it has been waging an 12-week-old offensive in retaliation for a cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by Hamas gunmen.\nWith hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians displaced, the idea may also go some way toward meeting a U.N. Security Council resolution of Dec. 22 calling for expanded humanitarian relief mechanisms.\n“It can start immediately,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM when asked about the Mediterranean corridor.\nHe said Britain, France, Greece and the Netherlands were among countries with vessels able to land directly on the shores of Gaza, which lacks a deep-water port. He appeared to suggest he expected them to do that rather than offload aid in Israel.\n“They requested of us that the equipment come via (the Israeli port of) Ashdod. The answer is no. It won’t come via Ashdod. It won’t come via Israel. We want disengagement, with security control. That’s the goal of this process,” Cohen said.\nThere was no immediate response from London, Paris, Athens or Amsterdam.\nBritain and Greece have previously expressed support for the Cypriot initiative, with Britain offering shallow-bottomed vessels to approach the Gaza coast, a senior Cypriot official told Reuters.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has also backed the Cypriot plan, which would involve Israeli security agents taking part in the Larnaca inspections.\n“As of now there is a maritime blockade, and if such an (aid) ship comes from Larnaca, it will be with our approval,” Cohen said. “It will of course be a secured corridor, as we have no intention of endangering a British or French ship coming in coordination with us.”\nSeveral European and Arab donor countries have been sending aid to Gaza through the nearby Egyptian coastal town of Al Arish. Israel has been involved in monitoring those shipments, in what some humanitarian relief agencies say creates lags.\nCairo tracks traffic across its Gaza border and has ruled out any influx of Palestinian refugees. On Saturday, Israel signalled it would seize control of the Gaza-Egypt border zone as part of its efforts to demilitarise the enclave.\n(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",
