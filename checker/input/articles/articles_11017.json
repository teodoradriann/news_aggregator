    "text": "A four-year-old California boy who wandered away from a campground in the Sierra National Forest was found safe after spending 22 hours alone in the wilderness, authorities said.\nA search-and-rescue team of about 50 officers and volunteers set out around 11am on Thursday after the child was reported missing from the camping site surrounded by dense forest north of Fresno.\nThe boy, from Torrance near Los Angeles, was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said.\nAround 8am on Friday, the boy was discovered in good condition “nestled under a tree” near a lake about a quarter mile (0.4 km) from the Rancheria Campground where his family was.\n“He was hungry and exhausted, but otherwise in good health. We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad,” the sheriff’s office said on Saturday.\nOfficials say the boy simply wandered away and lost his sense of direction.\nThe sheriff’s office thanked members of the public who volunteered to join the search, “kept their eyes peeled, spread the word on social media and sent prayers up”.\n“All of this undoubtedly helped to bring (him) home safely,” the department said.",

    "text": "Revolutionizing Industries: Naveen Kumar Shares Insights on the Future of Business Innovation 04-02-2025 11:12 PM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nImage: https://www.abnewswire.com/upload/2025/04/27f72ed18a923d4478622cf62464ef44.jpg\nHost: Naveen, thank you for joining us. Your remarkable career has set benchmarks in AI, ERP, and CRM innovation. What first drew you to these transformative technologies?\nNaveen Kumar: It's a pleasure to be here! My interest began with a fascination for solving complex, real-world problems through technology. Early on, I recognized the ability of ERP and CRM systems to revolutionize business operations. As AI and cloud computing advanced, I saw an opportunity to integrate these innovations into enterprise ecosystems-transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and efficiency. Every project has been an exciting journey of discovery and impact.\nHost: Among your notable achievements, you've led major digital transformations. Could you share a project that truly defines your approach?\nNaveen Kumar: Of course! One of my proudest projects was with a global consumer goods company dealing with outdated, fragmented systems. My team and I devised a phased strategy focused on three key pillars:\nProcess Revitalization: We streamlined operations by aligning cross-department workflows for better efficiency and accuracy.\nTechnology Modernization: Migrating to a unified cloud-based ERP integrated with cutting-edge CRM capabilities allowed seamless data flow and real-time insights.\nPeople Empowerment: Through training and open communication, we ensured every team member felt engaged and equipped for the transformation.\nThese efforts led to measurable success-a 30% increase in operational efficiency, reduced overhead costs, and a stronger connection with customers through personalized services. It exemplifies how technology, when paired with strategic processes and empowered teams, can redefine business growth.\nHost: You've perfected the art of aligning technology with measurable business outcomes. How do you approach this challenge?\nNaveen Kumar: It starts with clear alignment of technology initiatives to business priorities. Engaging stakeholders early to define goals such as cost reduction, improved customer engagement, or operational efficiency creates a roadmap for success. We use performance metrics as a foundation, tracking every phase against those indicators.\nAdopting agile methodologies allows flexibility to adapt and optimize strategies in real-time. We leverage advanced analytics throughout the process, ensuring data-driven refinements. But ultimately, success hinges on balancing technology with people and processes-creating not just tools, but transformative solutions that align perfectly with organizational objectives.\nHost: Apart from your contributions to the business world, you've made an enduring mark on academia. What motivates you to pursue research and mentorship?\nNaveen Kumar: Academia provides a unique space where innovative theories meet practical application. I find immense joy in bridging that gap-whether it's publishing research that addresses emerging industry challenges or mentoring aspiring professionals to think critically and push boundaries. Serving on editorial boards like IJIET and IJNIET amplifies this passion, enabling me to guide impactful research and inspire creativity in others. It's a privilege to contribute to the collective advancement of knowledge.\nHost: Your book, Intelligent Integration: Leveraging AI for Seamless ERP and CRM Connectivity, has been praised for its insights. What inspired you to write it?\nNaveen Kumar: The idea stemmed from witnessing the difficulties businesses face in connecting ERP and CRM systems, particularly when legacy systems come into play. I saw the potential of AI to overcome these challenges and deliver smarter, integrated solutions. The book was an opportunity to compile my experiences and present actionable strategies for executives and IT leaders. It's meant to be a resource-a roadmap for driving digital success with AI-enabled connectivity.\nHost: As a judge for elite industry awards, what traits do you consider defining in a standout innovation?\nNaveen Kumar: Bold vision and precise execution are what set exceptional innovations apart. The solution must not only address a current need but also be scalable and sustainable. I look for measurable impact, whether it's improved efficiency, enhanced customer experience, or transformative growth. Integration of cutting-edge technology with practical utility is key-ensuring it solves real problems while remaining adaptable to future demands. True innovation is both forward-thinking and grounded in strategic execution.\nHost: What excites you most about the future of technology?\nNaveen Kumar: The potential is limitless! Technologies like quantum computing, edge AI, and sustainable solutions are redefining possibilities. I'm particularly passionate about mentoring future leaders and participating in ethical discussions surrounding these advancements. The interplay of emerging tech with responsible innovation will drive industries to new heights-and I'm thrilled to contribute to that journey.\nHost: To wrap up, what advice would you give to those aspiring to lead in the tech world?\nNaveen Kumar: Embrace curiosity and keep learning-technology evolves constantly, and staying adaptable is key. Build expertise with a focus on strategic thinking, and never lose sight of the ultimate goal: making a meaningful impact. Technology is a tool, but its true power lies in how we use it to create positive change.\nHost: Naveen, thank you for sharing your expertise and inspiring insights. It's been an absolute privilege speaking with you.\nNaveen Kumar: Thank you-it's been a pleasure. I hope my experiences motivate others to harness the power of technology for innovation and growth.\nWebsite - https://www.naveenkumarbio.com/\nNaveen's LinkedIn Profile - https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveengarg1/\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Naveen Kumar\nContact Person: Naveen Kumar\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=revolutionizing-industries-naveen-kumar-shares-insights-on-the-future-of-business-innovation ]\nCity: Dallas, Texas\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://naveenkumarbio.com/\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
