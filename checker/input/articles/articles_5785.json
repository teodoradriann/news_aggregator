    "title": "For failing to give jail inmate Ferreira's letter to mother, MSHRC orders Rs 2 lakh compensation",
    "text": "Mumbai, Apr 25 (PTI) The Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission has directed the state home department to pay compensation of Rs 2 lakh to lawyer Arun Ferreira, an accused in the Elgar-Parishad Maoist link case, for violating his fundamental rights as a prisoner by not forwarding his letter on Father Stan Swamy to his mother.\nFrom facts and circumstances it is crystal clear that the Taloja Central Prison superintendent \"committed a great mistake\", Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) chairperson Justice K K Tated noted.\n\"Therefore, the commission, under the relevant provisions of the Protection of Human Rights Act and Regulation of the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (Procedure) Regulations, advised the state home department and Taloja central prison to pay Rs 2,00,000 as compensation to Ferreira,\" as per the order passed on April 4.\nFerreira was arrested in August 2018 for his alleged role in the Maoist link case and was in judicial custody in Taloja jail before being granted bail by the Supreme Court in July last year.\nIn his complaint to MSHRC, Ferreira said, while in prison, he had written a letter on July 14, 2021 to his mother about the memories of father Stan Swamy under the title &apos;Stan&apos;s profound simplicity&apos;.\nInstead of forwarding the letter, the jail superintendent filed an application before the trial court saying he (Ferreira) wants to publish objectionable material and, thus, should be warned as per Maharashtra Prison Manual, the complaint further stated.\nAs per Ferreira&apos;s complaint, the action taken by the jail was contrary to the law.\nBesides ordering payment of compensation, the MSHRC also directed the respondents to conduct workshops to educate its officers on prison rules regarding the censorship of letters written by inmates.\nFerreira and several other activists are accused in the Elgar-Parishad Maoist link case. The case pertains to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 which, according to the Pune police, was funded by Maoists.\nThe inflammatory speeches made there led to violence at the Koregaon Bhima war memorial in Pune the next day, police had alleged. The case was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).",

    "title": "'Underutilized strategy': Storm drain murals raise awareness for waterway pollution",
    "text": "At the end of June, visual artist and visionary painter Molly Chopin perched under a tarp, rain trickling down the sidewalk as she brushed paint onto the pavement. Slowly but surely, small splotches of color transformed into a landscape of longleaf pines and swirling water, all centered around a single storm drain.\nAt the top of her mural were the words, “Keep our waterways clean and the earth evergreen,” a memo she selected to demonstrate the importance of keeping trash out of storm drains, which all lead to nearby creeks and eventually, Jordan Lake — a huge sourcing of drinking water for those in the Triangle.\nChopin’s art, alongside many other storm drain murals throughout Chapel Hill, was commissioned by the Town of Chapel Hill as a part of the Storm Drain Murals project, which started in 2022 as a collaboration between the Community Arts and Culture division and Stormwater Management. Since then, 11 artists have created unique public art, from a tangled, colorful pipe mural to various landscapes of the distinct N.C. deciduous forests. Chopin’s mural on Rosemary Street is the most recent addition.\nAbout 1 million residents in the surrounding area get their drinking water from Jordan Lake. According to the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice, point source pollution has remained a huge problem for Jordan Lake since the 1960s, where the Triangle has continued to see drastic population increases that has left treatment infrastructure unable to keep up with the pace.\nChopin’s piece resonates with both the aim of the project — to educate people about storm drains and their direct connection to local waterways — and with her own beliefs about nature and people, she said.\n“I create a lot of art that is intended to remind people of the spiritual nature of existence, so a lot of my work does involve landscapes, elements of nature and trying to put face to unseen energies as well as to render that which is seen,” she said. “And to create imagery to remind people of that interconnectedness between the two.”\nNature shows up in much of Chopin’s work, she said, including what she refers to as a “system of symbiosis,” where multiple systems — both man-made and naturally occurring — feed into one another.\nChopin’s painting includes both a landscape of longleaf pines and a rainbow, which Chopin also uses in much of her work, as well as a spiraling, geometric figure. This figure is known as the “seed of life,” which spiritually represents creation and the origin of all energy, she said, and is represented in numerous cultures.",

    "text": "Thrilling Outcomes in Recent High School Girls' Basketball Games\nPackers’ QB Jordan Love: A Viral Act of Kindness Amid Snowstorm\nAmid the biting cold and snow-filled streets of Wisconsin, a moment of unexpected warmth captured the internet’s attention. Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love, named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks, exhibited an act of kindness that extended far beyond the football field.\nLove’s Unplanned Act of Kindness\nIt was an ordinary snowy day in De Pere when 20-year-old Lucy Kurowski found herself struggling to free her car from a stubborn parking spot. Unbeknownst to her, she was about to experience a moment that would become an internet sensation. Love, who happened to pass by, initially drove away, only to return moments later to lend a helping hand. Despite their collective efforts, the car remained stuck, but the encounter itself was a victory for Kurowski.\nA Viral Encounter\nThe two shared a selfie, a simple memento that soon catapulted onto the global stage. Shared on social media, it quickly garnered over 3.3 million views, creating an online buzz that even caught the attention of the NFL, which acknowledged the event on their social media platforms. The encounter underlined the shared humanity that binds us, even as it highlighted Love’s character off the field.\nThe Impact Beyond the Field\nKurowski, a college student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, lauded Love for his generosity, celebrating him as an exemplary figure both on and off the field. This event occurred just hours before the Packers were set to travel to Arlington, Texas, for a wild-card playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys. But for Love, it was about more than just football. It was about embracing the spirit of community, about extending a hand when it mattered—a testament to the power of kindness that transcends the boundaries of the football field.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "text": "Informe Copernicus\nLa extensión global de hielo marino alcanza la cifra más baja desde que hay registros\nEl último informe Copernicus advierte que el pasado febrero fue el tercero más cálido desde que tenemos registros\nLos osos polares pierden hasta un kilo al día durante unos deshielos que se alargan cada vez más\n¿Qué consecuencias tendría el deshielo de la Antártida y Groenlandia?\nGroenlandia pierde hielo a pasos agigantados / Agencias\nNunca había habido tan poco hielo en el planeta como ahora. Según desvela el último informe del Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus (C3S), el gran termómetro para entender el avance de la crisis climática en el conjunto del planeta, el pasado mes de febrero la extensión global del hielo marino alcanzó un nuevo mínimo histórico. Los datos revelan que la extensión diaria del hielo marino combinada, es decir, la suma del hielo en el Ártico y la Antártida, cayó a su nivel más bajo desde que comenzaron las observaciones satelitales en 1978. En el Ártico, la extensión del hielo fue un 8% inferior al promedio para esta época, mientras que en la Antártida fue un 26% menor que lo esperado a estas alturas del año. \"Es una de las muchas consecuencias de vivir en un mundo cada vez más cálido\", afirma advierte Samantha Burgess, del Centro Europeo de Predicción a Medio Plazo (ECMWF).\nSegún apuntan los registros, la extensión del hielo marino ártico encadena ya tres meses consecutivos de mínimos récord, lo que refuerza las preocupaciones sobre su progresivo declive. Aun así, los expertos subrayan que el récord de febrero no significa que estemos ante un mínimo absoluto, ya que justo en esta época el hielo de la región se encuentra en su fase de crecimiento estacional y se espera que, si no hay más imprevistos, remonte durante el mes de marzo y registre su valor más alto del año. En el caso de la Antártida, en cambio, se estima que el hielo marino podría haber alcanzado su mínimo anual a finales de febrero, lo que lo convertiría en el segundo valor más bajo registrado hasta la fecha.\nLa extensión del hielo marino ártico encadena ya tres meses consecutivos de mínimos récord\nLa reducción del hielo marino de las zonas polares del planeta no solo afecta a los ecosistemas locales sino que, tal y como advierten los expertos, tiene efectos en todo el planeta. Cada vez son más los estudios que muestran cómo el avance del deshielo contribuye al aumento del nivel del mar, altera los patrones climáticos globales y hasta intensifica las olas de calor marinas. En el caso del Ártico, la reducción del hielo marino afecta a especies como los osos polares y las focas, que dependen de este hábitat para sobrevivir y que actualmente, debido al mal estado de estos ecosistemas, están cada vez más expuestos al riesgo de extinción.\nSíntoma del calentamiento global\nLos científicos advierten que la disminución del hielo marino está directamente relacionada con el calentamiento global. Los registros de Copernicus, de hecho, afirman que febrero de 2025 fue el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial desde que existen registros, con una temperatura media del aire en superficie de 13,36°C, lo que supone 0,63°C por encima del promedio de 1991-2020. Este último registro se suma a la preocupante tendencia de temperaturas excepcionalmente altas registradas en los últimos meses y que, en muchos casos, han marcado una larga racha consecutiva de récords mensuales de temperatura. En total, se estima que en al menos 19 de los últimos 20 meses la temperatura global ha superado la línea roja de los de 1,5 grados de calentamiento por encima de los niveles preindustriales.\n19 de los últimos 20 meses la temperatura global ha superado la línea roja de los de 1,5 grados de calentamiento global\nEn Europa, por ejemplo, la temperatura media de febrero estuvo 0,40°C por encima del promedio de 1991-2020. Se trata de una cifra anómala pero que, tras años de calentamiento extremo, ha logrado escapar del top10 de febrero más cálidos registrados en el conjunto del continente. Los territorios europeos con temperaturas más altas de lo normal destacan los Alpes, Islandia y el noroeste del continente, como la Península Escandinava y Finlandia. En total, se estima que el invierno europeo de 2025, que meteorológicamente hablando engloba desde diciembre 2024 hasta febrero 2025, fue el segundo más cálido registrado, con 1.46°C por encima de la media de las últimas décadas.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo\n¡Suscríbete y no te pierdas esta noticia!\nAyúdanos a adaptar más el contenido a ti y aprovecha las ventajas de nuestros suscriptores.\nSi ya estás registrado pincha aquí.",

    "text": "La commande gouvernementale passée aux directions d’écoles est de réduire leurs dépenses de 570 millions de dollars.\nBien que le ministre de l’Éducation, Bernard Drainville, leur ait demandé d’affecter le moins possible les services directs aux élèves, ces groupes soutiennent que cela sera impossible, vu l’ampleur des réductions demandées.\n«Ce qui se passe présentement en éducation est inadmissible et c’est pourquoi les différents acteurs se mobilisent. On coupe des postes, des mesures essentielles aux apprentissages et au bien-être des élèves. Le réseau doit être soutenu à la hauteur des ambitions des Québécois. C’est de notre avenir qu’il s’agit», a affirmé Nicolas Prévost, président de la Fédération québécoise des directions d’établissement d’enseignement.\nJusqu’ici, les voix s’étaient fait entendre séparément contre les restrictions budgétaires, mais, cette fois, les groupes concernés ont formé une coalition, un mouvement baptisé «Ensemble, unis pour l’école».\nLa Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ), qui représente 125 000 membres dans le milieu de l’éducation, en fait aussi partie, tout comme le Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec.",
