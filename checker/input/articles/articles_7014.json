    "text": "Here’s another morale booster. It is good to laugh !! Andy Borowitz writes his columns a couple times a week, and an extended one on Sundays. The Borowitz Report is, IMO, must-read. You can see TBR free on Substack. If you like his work as much as I do you can subscribe & receive it by email. www.borowitzreport.com/… It’s short enough I’ll just paste it all below. Andy gave me permission to post this and thereby spread the word about his parody pieces. PALM BEACH (The Borowitz Report)—A campaign aide confirmed on Thursday that every candidate who wants to be Donald J. Trump’s running mate must also pledge to be his cellmate. J.D. Vance, Doug Burgum, and Marco Rubio have all committed to joining Trump in prison, with Senator Rubio expressing unbridled enthusiasm at the prospect. “Whether we’re breaking rocks or picking up trash by the highway, it will be an honor to be chained to the greatest president this country has ever known,” the senator said. But Rubio may not get his wish, the aide cautioned, if Trump decides he wants a VP with prison experience. The aide said that Trump has a lengthy roster of associates who either have been in prison, like Peter Navarro and the QAnon Shaman, or might be headed there, like Rudy Giuliani and Clarence Thomas. “He’s willing to share a prison cell with any of the criminals he’s worked with,” the aide said, “except Bannon, obviously.” ~ end ~",

    "text": "Dharavi youth who fought poverty now an Army officer\nMUMBAI: The industrious inhabitants of Dharavi-Sion Koliwada were a proud lot Saturday. A tenacious 26-year-old named Umesh Dillirao Keelu became the first youth from the precinct to be commissioned in Indian Army.\nNine members of his family, including his mother and married sister, attended Saturday’s passing out parade at OTA (Officers Training Academy) in Chennai.\nYears before wearing the olive uniform, Umesh fought hand-to-hand combat with poverty and misfortune. “My father, a painter, became paralysed in 2013 and died of heart attack a day before I had to report for Army training, in March 2023,” Umesh said by phone from Chennai. “Today I completed my 11-month training and become a commissioned officer in the Army.”\nHis sunburnt upbringing, in fact, fuelled his appetite for success. Right from his teens, the determined student self-funded his education, acquiring scholarships, working at a local cyber cafe. He received assistance from Tata Trusts, PF Davar Trust and Mahalaxmi Trust.\nUmesh completed his BSc in IT and took a Masters degree in computer science. “I also worked at Tata Consultancy Services for three years followed by a stint at British Council on the weekends.” What the youth modestly does not mention is that he shouldered the responsibility of his entire family and funded his father’s treatment by this multitasking.\nEarly training in the NCC had set his sights on a career in the defence forces. His attraction was fuelled by the fact that the Army would afford him the opportunity to play sport and travel while ennobling him as he served the nation. “I managed to clear the SSB (Services Selection Board) exam after 13 attempts. I cannot reveal my posting, that is a confidential matter. Suffice to say that I am affiliated with the IT infantry unit,” he said.\nUmesh did not fail to mention the perilous circumstances that engulf Dharavi. He posted on X, “There is a high rate of unemployment. I hope my achievement will motivate other youngsters from the area to join the Army, which at present they know little about. Lots of people are facing financial crisis.”\nUmesh told TOI, “I want to say to other youth, if you are aiming for something in your life, and you are working hard, you will achieve your goal. Be prepared, move on, face all the problems, face the odds. Even if you fail your exams, keep practising. Talk to mentors, officers, that will really help you.”\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
