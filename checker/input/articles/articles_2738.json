    "text": "“As part of this unique national program, almost one in five smokers in England‍ will receive a vaping starter kit as well as behavioral support to help ⁤them quit smoking,” said in a press release. the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Care.\nThis program is part of a series of new measures aimed at helping the government achieve its goal of a smoke-free England by 2030, which amounts to reducing smoking rates to 5% or less, specifies the⁣ same source .\nLocal authorities will be invited to ​participate‍ in the program during the year and each of them will design a program adapted to their needs,​ in particular by deciding which populations to target‌ as a priority.\nIn a speech on Tuesday March ⁣11, Health Minister Neil O’Brien also ⁤announced that following ⁤the ⁣success of local programs, pregnant women will be offered financial incentives to help them quit smoking . This will⁢ involve offering vouchers, as well as behavioral support, to all pregnant women who smoke by the end of next year.\nThe government will also ​consult on the introduction of mandatory inserts on cigarette⁣ packets containing positive messages and information to help people quit smoking.\nIn addition, illicit sales of vaping products will be cracked down as part of‌ measures to prevent children and ​non-smokers from taking ​up smoking, a habit that is growing in popularity among young people, the statement said.\nHealth Minister Neil O’Brien said: “Up to two in three lifelong smokers⁣ will ‍die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on⁢ sale that can kill you if used We will offer‍ a million smokers new help to quit smoking. We will fund a new national ‌’change to quit’ programme, the first⁤ of its ⁤kind in the ⁢world. We will work‍ with municipal authorities and ⁢others to deliver. ​one million smokers in England with a free‌ vaping starter kit.\nThe new policies will achieve the government’s three goals: helping more adults quit smoking, ⁣preventing children and non-smokers from taking up vaping, and using vaping as a tool ⁢to help ⁤adult smokers quit smoking. smoke.\nFor those who quit smoking, the risk⁢ of heart attack is halved after a year of ⁣quitting, ​which halves the likelihood of ending up in a hospital bed or worse, according ⁤to the same source.\nHelping more women experience cigarette-free pregnancies will reduce the number of babies born ‌underweight ​or underdeveloped, with health problems requiring neonatal and continuing care. This will ​also reduce the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nReducing ⁤smoking rates reduces the number of smoking-related illnesses needing to be⁤ treated, reducing pressure on the NHS and helping ⁣to reduce waiting lists, according to the ministry.\nNHS figures for 2021‌ showed that 9% of children ⁣aged 11 to 15 used e-cigarettes, up from 6% in 2018.\nGiven this sharp increase, Mr. O’Brien will launch a call for ‍submissions on youth vaping to identify opportunities to reduce the number of children⁢ accessing and using vaping products – and ​explore areas where the government can go further.\nWorking with‍ law enforcement agencies and building on the Government’s work with the ​Trading Standards on‌ illicit tobacco, new funding of ​£3 ​million will also be provided to create⁤ a “brigade “Illicit Vaping Products Law Enforcement” specializes in enforcing the rules relating to vaping and combating illicit vaping products⁢ and sales to minors.\nAs part of these measures, HMRC and Border Force will also publish an updated strategy to combat illicit tobacco this year. This strategy will strategically outline how⁣ to continue to target, catch and punish those⁤ involved‍ in ‍the ‌illicit tobacco market.\nIn 2021, smoking prevalence in England was 13%, the lowest rate ever recorded, thanks to measures such as doubling ⁣cigarette duty since ‌2010 and maintaining funding for local tobacco control services. smoking.\nIn 2021-22, £68 million of public health funding was spent by local authorities on quit smoking services and ⁢almost 100,000 people quit smoking with the help‌ of a quit smoking service. help⁣ with smoking cessation.\nHowever, 5.4 million​ people ⁣in​ England still smoke cigarettes, which remains ‌the biggest cause of preventable illness and death. Up to two in three lifelong smokers will die from smoking and recent data shows that⁤ one in four deaths from all cancers are ⁤due to smoking.\nLast year, an independent review into smoking, led by Javed Khan, proposed a series of‍ measures to help people kick their addiction, which inspired the measures ⁢presented today.\nInterview between Time.news Editor‌ and Smoking Cessation Expert\nTime.news Editor : Welcome, Dr. Emily Richards, a leading expert in public⁣ health policy and smoking cessation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss⁤ the‌ UK’s new initiative aimed at reducing smoking ‌rates. This program seeks to provide‍ vaping starter⁢ kits to about one in five smokers in​ England. What ​do ‌you think‌ is the‍ significance⁤ of this approach?\nDr. Emily Richards : ⁢Thank you for having me. The significance of this program cannot be overstated. It represents a proactive ​step toward achieving⁤ a​ smoke-free England by 2030, targeting a smoking rate of 5% or lower. By providing both​ vaping kits and ⁣behavioral support, it offers a dual strategy—recognizing that quitting smoking is not just about having an alternative product ⁢but also about addressing the psychological ⁢and behavioral aspects⁣ of ⁤addiction.\nEditor : It’s⁤ interesting ​to see that local authorities can tailor their programs. What do ⁢you think ⁣the benefits of this ‌localized approach will ‍be?\nDr. Richards :⁢ Customization is​ key in ⁣public health initiatives. Each community ‌has unique ‍demographics and specific challenges. Allowing ⁢local authorities to design their own programs means they can ​prioritize populations that are most at⁣ risk or⁤ those who need the most support. This⁤ flexibility can lead to more⁤ effective solutions and a⁤ higher likelihood of smokers engaging with the program.\nEditor :‍ The program ⁤also includes financial ⁢incentives for pregnant women who smoke. How crucial is it to target this demographic, and what potential impact ‍do ​you see?\nDr. Richards :‍ Targeting pregnant⁣ women is vital for ‍several reasons. Smoking during ​pregnancy significantly increases the ⁣risk of complications such as low birth weight, miscarriage, ‌and stillbirth. By offering‌ financial⁣ incentives and⁤ support, the program not only helps the mothers but also promotes healthier pregnancies, leading to‌ better outcomes ⁢for both mothers and their babies. This ‍can have lasting effects on health costs associated with neonatal care and beyond.\nEditor : Health Minister Neil O’Brien mentioned‍ the introduction of positive messaging ⁤on cigarette packets. How effective do‌ you think this could be in ⁣changing smoking behaviors?\nDr. Richards : Positive messaging on cigarette packets could serve as a powerful reinforcement ​tool. While ⁤health warnings are crucial, spotlighting success stories, help resources, and positive ‌outcomes ‍can encourage smokers to consider quitting. Research ​has shown that psychological nudges ‍can significantly ​change consumer behavior, and this could ‍be⁣ a simple yet ​effective way to enhance awareness and motivation towards quitting.\nEditor : There are concerns about youth vaping, especially with numbers rising among children aged 11 to 15. What do you recommend as ⁣a preventive strategy to combat this ​trend?\nDr. Richards :​ The rise in youth vaping is indeed alarming. To combat this trend, a multifaceted approach⁣ is necessary.⁣ The government must focus on educating children and parents about the dangers of vaping, while also⁤ enforcing stricter ‍regulations⁢ on marketing practices⁢ aimed​ at young⁢ people. Additionally, ‌better monitoring of sales​ and‌ implementing a robust age verification system will be critical. Ensuring that vaping products are not⁤ easily accessible ⁤to minors is essential.\nEditor : Lastly, there’s evidence that quitting smoking significantly reduces⁢ health risks. With smoking-related illnesses putting pressure on the NHS, how might reducing smoking‌ rates ⁣impact ​public health​ overall?\nDr. Richards :‌ Reducing smoking rates⁢ has profound ⁣implications for public health and the healthcare system. Fewer⁣ smokers mean a decrease in smoking-related illnesses ⁤like heart disease‌ and lung cancer, which‍ in turn alleviates pressure on⁤ the NHS and⁤ its resources. Improved ⁤health‌ outcomes can lead ‌to ‍shorter waiting times, lower healthcare costs , and a healthier population. This is ⁢not just an investment in ⁣individual lives but in the health of society as a whole.\nEditor : ​Thank⁣ you, Dr. Richards, for your‌ insights. It’s clear that the UK’s initiative to reduce smoking⁣ rates has the potential to ‌make a ⁣significant impact, ​not only on individual health but also‌ on public ⁢health resources. We appreciate your time and expertise!\nDr. Richards : Thank ‍you for having me. I’m optimistic about the changes ahead ⁣and hope⁢ to see continued progress in ‍the fight against smoking.",

In 2024, there will be two supermoons and a seasonal blue moon. Despite fewer full moons than in 2023 due to the lunar year being 354 days, the upcoming year will host 12. Below are the full moon dates and times for 2024, as per [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/full-moon-names.html), along with their North American names : - January 25- Wolf Moon (17:54 UTC/12:54 p.m. ET) - February 24- Snow Moon (12:30 UTC/7:30 a.m. ET) - March 25- Worm Moon (07:00 UTC/3:00 a.m. ET); a penumbral lunar eclipse - April 23- Pink Moon (23:48 UTC/7:48 p.m. ET) - May 23- Flower Moon (13:53 UTC/9:53 a.m. ET) - June 21- Strawberry Moon (01:07 UTC/9:07 p.m. ET) - July 21- Buck Moon (10:17 UTC/6:17 a.m. ET) - August 19- Sturgeon Moon (18:25 UTC/2:25 p.m. ET); a supermoon and a blue moon - September 18- Harvest Moon (02:34 UTC/10:34 p.m. ET); a supermoon and a partial lunar eclipse - October 17- Hunter's Moon (11:26 UTC/7:26 a.m. ET); a supermoon - November 15- Beaver Moon (21:28 UTC/4:28 p.m. ET); a supermoon - December. 15- Cold Moon (09:01 UTC/4:01 a.m. ET) READ ALSO: [First Full Moon of the Year Will Rise This Week Alongside the Quadrantids Meteor Shower](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/41666/20230102/first-full-moon-year-will-rise-week-alongside-quadrantids-meteor.htm) Lunar and Solar Eclipses in 2024 In 2024, there will be [two lunar eclipses](https://www.almanac.com/eclipses), each with its unique characteristics. The first, occurring on March 24/25, will be a penumbral lunar eclipse, where the full Worm Moon will pass through Earth's outer penumbral shadow. This subtle event will take place from 12:51-5:35 a.m. EDT, causing the Moon to appear slightly dimmer than usual. While visible globally, the effects are minimal compared to a total lunar eclipse, and using binoculars or a telescope is recommended for a clearer view. On [April 8, 2024](https://www.foxweather.com/earth-space/calendar-guide-2024-moon-stars-planets-when), a total solar eclipse will captivate Central and North America. The Moon will completely block the Sun, creating temporary darkness during the afternoon. This rare occurrence happens about twice a year globally, but a specific location witnessing such an event occurs only once every 400 years. Communities are planning celebratory events, marking a unique experience. Astronomers emphasize the need for specialized eye protection when observing the solar eclipse. The second lunar eclipse of 2024 is set for September 17/18, presenting a partial lunar eclipse during the Harvest Moon, also a supermoon. Around 8% of the moon will enter Earth's inner umbral shadow, displaying a rosy reddish hue from 10:12-11:17 p.m. EDT on September 17. Visible across the Western Hemisphere, this event, like the March eclipse, is best observed with binoculars or a telescope. Lunar eclipses, occurring two or three times a year, are relatively common, with the next one visible from the U.S. scheduled for April 2025.

Los detalles.\nEsta semana, una noticia en España alteró al mundo del fútbol.\nEl entrenador del Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti fue acusado por la Abogacía del Estado de España por dos delitos fiscales y pidieron cinco años de cárcel para el técnico merengue.\nSegún detallaron medios españoles, el italiano defraudó a Hacienda por más de un millón de euros: casi 400 mil en 2014 y casi 700 mil en 2015, en los ejercicios fiscales.\nDesde la fiscalía española acusaron al ex Milan de que debía tributar en el país el total de sus ingresos, pero el italiano declaró solo el pago que recibía por parte de Real Madrid y no así el dinero que ganaba por derecho de imagen.\nQué dijo Carlo Ancelotti sobre la acusación de la fiscalía en España\nEn 2021, el técnico más ganador de la historia de la Champions habló sobre el tema y dijo que “había estado mal asesorado” y ese fue el motivo de su error a hora de declarar ante la Fiscalía. Aunque aclaró que ya había pagado la multa que le correspondía y que él ya no contaba con el dinero.\nPero desde la Fiscalía Provincial de Madrid y la Abogacía del Estado de España piden cinco años de prisión para Ancelotti por ocultación y falta de declaración de ingresos. En un primer momento, la Fiscalía había pedido cuatro años y nueve meses.\nEl entrenador italiano, exige una revisión a la baja de las penas porque reiteró que ya pagó la multa y cubrió el fraude. En caso de que eso no ocurra, Carletto podría ir a la prisión, lo cual le impediría continuar al mando de Real Madrid.",

    "text": "Fernanda Paes Leme falou pela primeira vez sobre o fim da amizade com Giovanna Ewbank e Bruno Gagliasso. No episódio desta quarta-feira (16) de seu videocast, que se chama Grande Surto, a atriz negou que houvesse qualquer briga entre eles, mas admitiu que a relação já não é mais a mesma.\n“A gente claramente se afastou e eu nunca falei disso diretamente, mas não teve uma briga. Teve um monte de pequenas coisas, afinidades diferentes, momentos diferentes e sensibilidades diferentes também”, explicou.\nNo episódio, que tinha como tema “Amizade Tem Prazo de Validade?” e como convidadas Jana Rosa e Juvi Chagas, a apresentadora disse que o afastamento não partiu dela. Ela avaliou ter insistido em manter contato “mais do que deveria” e que isso não foi positivo para nenhuma das partes.\nA apresentadora também relatou que sofreu mais pela tentativa de manter algo que já não existia do que pela perda da relação. “Amizade não é algo que precisamos forçar, não é uma cobrança”, refletiu.\nApesar do distanciamento, Fernanda afirmou não guardar ressentimento e comentou que o carinho por Giovanna e Bruno permanece o mesmo. Segundo ela, o que realmente importa são as coisas boas vividas entre eles.\n“Eu espero que a gente consiga se encontrar na vida, ter amor, leveza e viver novas coisas boas”, disse sobre uma possível reaproximação com o casal no futuro.\nA amizade entre Fernanda e Bruno existia antes mesmo de ele ser casado com Giovanna. As duas se tornaram amigas com o tempo e, mais recentemente, chegaram a dividir a bancada do podcast Quem Pode, Pod entre 2022 e 2023.\nFernanda também é madrinha de Bless, um dos filhos do casal.",

    "text": "Point Austin: Everything Old Is New Again The long, honorable history of students “disturbing the war” By [Michael King](/authors/michael-king/), 8:00AM, Sat. May 4, 2024 From 2005-2020, now-retired Austin Chronicle News Editor [Michael King](/authors/michael-king/) wrote about city and state politics from a progressive perspective in his weekly column, “ [Point Austin](/news/point-austin/).” We’re pleased to bring back his column whenever he’s inspired to tackle the state we’re in. Is it time to start quoting Dylan again? And here I sit so patiently Waiting to find out what price You have to pay to get out of Going through all these things twice … – “ [Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/stuck-inside-mobile-memphis-blues-again/)” Watching events unfold in the past few weeks at Columbia University, Emory University, USC, UCLA and many places elsewhere – even my hallowed alma mater, Indiana University – my sense of deja vu has become a little overwhelming. We have definitely been here before. History may not repeat, but sometimes it certainly rhymes. I looked about for my faded copy of [Who Rules Columbia?](https://nacla.org/who-rules-columbia), the Sixties-era booklet that helpfully traced the connections between the university and what President Eisenhower presciently described as the “ [military-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower%27s_farewell_address).” Turns out you don’t need a physical copy anymore – the 34-page pamphlet produced by the [North American Congress on Latin America](https://nacla.org/) is available for download from an internet that didn’t exist in 1968. NACLA itself is now a nonprofit housed at New York University – where students are also protesting the war in Gaza and getting busted for their effort. Gaza and the Middle East is not exactly NACLA territory, but as NACLA once did for Columbia, among this new generation there are certainly folks reviewing the research-and-training network between American universities and the Israeli military machine. That’s what the demand for “divestment” is all about. More than 50 years later, the rhetoric of the NACLA report sounds at times a little tendentious, but (with some help by documentation liberated by occupiers from the office of then Columbia president Grayson Kirk) it helpfully traces the institutional networks among New York money, political and business power, and the defense and intelligence establishment. It provides wide-ranging analysis of an incestuous relationship between the state and academia, e.g.: “The importance of the relationship between the intelligence community and Columbia is great. The universities and their personnel serve in an advisory capacity and as a feed-back mechanism for intelligence evaluation. Also, by involving academics in intelligence, the CIA is able to create a favorable disposition towards the secrecy and manipulation which has become essential to many government operations in America.” Columbia was (and is) certainly not alone. Meanwhile, on the theory that what didn’t work 50 years ago should surely succeed today, university administrators have been staging a [militarized revival](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/us/campus-protests-arrests.html) of Sixties institutional responses to student protests, supported to a great degree by politicians and law enforcement. Nowhere has that been more apparent than in Austin, where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott leapt at yet another opportunity for performative brutality, student-beating and chest-beating in equal measure. This heavy-handed response has mostly been the institutional pattern across the country – but not everywhere. To the credit of the D.C. police department, when it was called upon by George Washington University administrators to put down a student protest, officers took a look, saw that the students were peaceful, and declined to intervene. At least some lawmen [still follow the law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/29/gw-campus-protests-palestine/). And guess what? While official over-reaction elsewhere has predictably triggered nastier clashes, the GWU protests have remained peaceful and educational, even while posturing [GOP Congressmen demand repression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/01/gw-protests-house-republicans-dc-response/). Although it’s been more than 50 years, I and my fellow I.U. alums have definitely had flashbacks to our time as undergraduates, when we reacted to the escalations of the U.S. war on Southeast Asia (and to institutional racism) with opposition, strikes, demonstrations, and occasional disruptions. The I.U. demos then were both massive and almost entirely peaceful, and – unlike today – there were very few mass arrests. Those did happen elsewhere (and occasionally worse, e.g., the entirely unnecessary national guard/police killings at Kent State and Jackson State). But that era was before the feds began offloading excess military hardware to local police departments, and also before the Supreme Court decided More-Guns-Everywhere had become rational public policy. The moral and ideological lines now are murkier, as well, with Hamas and Israel locked in a grotesque conflict mostly targeting civilians. In response , students are peacefully (with some lamentable exceptions) declaring: Enough is enough. It’s helpful to recall the words of [Howard Zinn](https://www.howardzinn.org/collection/disturbing-the-war/) on Vietnam anti-war protests: “And they’ll say we’re disturbing the peace, but there is no peace. What really bothers them is that we are disturbing the war.” It should not surprise anyone that UT administrators are claiming that “weapons,” including guns, were allegedly confiscated in the latest aftermath of the campus protests. In recent years, I’ve attended a few Capitol rallies where state police stood between armed right- and left-wing militants enjoying their alleged Second Amendment rights, “rights” eagerly applauded and reinforced by the Legislature – and specifically [welcomed on campus](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/11/texas-legislature-campus-carry-guns-schools/). Is it any surprise that students or their sympathizers will follow that pernicious lead, or that blood will eventually spill? (As of publication, Travis County Attorney Delia Garza said there had been [no evidence](https://www.kut.org/crime-justice/2024-05-02/ut-says-pro-palestinian-demonstrators-carried-guns-and-assaulted-people-prosecutors-beg-to-differ) of protesters carrying guns or weapons.) As it happens, decades ago I also taught at UT-Austin for several years, and became familiar with administrators’ reflexive deference to state power, both because it comes to them naturally and because they persuade themselves that obedience will result in self-protection. The example of Columbia president Minouche Shafik, who cracked the whip on protesting students only to have House Speaker [Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/24/mike-johnson-house-speaker-columbia-student-gaza-protests/) demand her resignation, should remind everyone how pointless it is to appease the powerful – they simply demand more appeasement. It is sometimes said, in the wake of the latest crackdowns on student protest, that politicians and administrators have failed to “learn the lessons” of earlier crackdowns, vividly recalled from the Sixties. But what lessons should they learn? That repression only spawns more resistance (as it does), or that repression is enthusiastically applauded in the venomous right-wing media-sphere that didn’t exist in 1968? Certainly Gov. Abbott recognizes the headlines and political capital to be gained by sending in the heavily armed state troopers. What works at the Texas border will surely work on UT’s South Lawn. Only a few years ago, Abbott and his party were insisting that universities must defend “free speech” at all costs, denouncing what they called “cancel culture” allegedly aimed at conservative students, and enshrining “ [free speech on campus](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/04/29/ut-austin-pro-palestinian-demonstrations-free-speech/)” into state law. They failed to helpfully footnote, “We mean freedom of speech only for opinions that coincide with our own.” That was then. Now that current students are reacting with revulsion at Israel’s unmediated slaughter of Palestinians, Abbott screams “ [antisemitism](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/27/israel-hamas-war-texas-universities/)” and sends in the troops. Unlike the direct U.S. adventure in Vietnam, our complicity in the Gaza war is indirect, but very real, and further complicated by the horrendous Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians by Hamas. But to demand a cease-fire and an end to war on civilians is neither support for “terrorism” nor is it antisemitism. A state government (and state GOP) that [can’t bring itself to denounce Nazis](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/02/texas-gop-antisemitism-resolution/) has no business standing in judgment over students denouncing genocide. As for Gov. Abbott, it’s useful to recall Chicago Mayor Richard Daley’s memorable malapropism in response to criticism of the police attacks on demonstrators at the 1968 Democratic Convention: “Gentlemen, get the thing straight once and for all – the policeman isn’t there to create disorder, the policeman is there to preserve disorder.” Alas, we have been here before.

    "text": "Arkia Airlines today operated the first flight from Srilanka to Israel. The passengers on the special flight were 210 foreign workers for the agriculture sector in the Gaza Envelope, who were brought to Israel by the director of foreign workers at the Population and Immigration Authority. With this flight, Arkia preceded the regular commercial flights between Israel and Sri Lanka by about forty days, which are scheduled to begin on February 6, 2024. In fact, the regular route was originally planned to be inaugurated at the end of October, but was postponed because of the war. The flights from Tel Aviv to Bandaranaike Airport (CMB) in the capital city of Colombo in Sri Lanka will be operated by Airbus 321 Neo aircraft. This is a weekly flight on Tuesdays, and return on Wednesdays. The original plan was to fly the short route over Saudi Arabia and Oman, but Israeli aircraft have stopped flying this route since the outbreak The war, for security reasons. It is to be expected that we will return to flying over Oman. Air ticket prices start at $778, compared to prices starting at $599 planned for flights on the short and direct route. Sri Lanka is one of the most visited countries in the world , especially by lovers of nature and peace, surfing, and Buddhism. The island is considered a paradise for animal lovers, and is full of jungles and wildlife parks. Families with children can play with elephants and giant deer, and ride them. Sri Lanka boasts one of the world ’s highest rates of biological endemism. Many roads wind through the mountains, green forests, rice fields, parks and sleepy villages. In the heart of the island there are jeep tours in charming jungles with elephants and tigers, which attract safari-loving tourists. Sri Lanka once had a magnificent Jewish community, some of whose members reached the top of law, government, and culture. Few vestiges of this splendor remain. In addition, there are popular beaches in Sri Lanka that attract surfers from all over the world as well as from Israel. Most Israelis who visit Sri Lanka prefer to come to the Hikkaduwa surf beaches on the south coast, and the other in Arugam Bay, on the east coast of Sri Lanka. In both, big waves come to the beach that are very suitable for surfing. Therefore, because of the popular destinations for surfing, Arkia also offers a special option to fly personal surfboards on the line to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has the potential to be a hit for Israeli tourists in the coming years. Oz Berlovitz, CEO of Arkia, announces today: “This is an exciting event for the company and the country. The SriLanka project, one of Arkia’s most important, Kerem Or and Geid today, with the landing of the special plane, feel part of the important assistance to the country in bringing essential workers to the agricultural industry in Israel. As a result of the war, we had to postpone the planned start-up date, and in recent weeks, many efforts have been made to open the destination and issue the special flight.” Read more: New York Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak Investigated | Video | Univision 41 New York WXTV Oz Berlovitz thanks the people without whom this would not have happened.
