    "text": "Violencia Un ataque armado en Nigeria se salda con al menos trece muertos El gobernador en funciones de Níger, Yajubu Garba, tachó los hechos de \"satánicos, insensibles y atroces\" EP Al menos trece personas han [muerto](/tags/muerte/) en un ataque perpetrado por parte de hombres armados en la comunidad Anguwan Mai-Giro, que se encuentra entre las localidades de Rafi y Shiro, en el estado nigeriano de Níger, en el centro del país africano. El ataque, que tuvo lugar el miércoles por la noche, ha sido condenado por el gobernador en funciones de Níger, Yajubu Garba, quien ha descrito los hechos como \"satánicos, insensibles y atroces\". \"Es muy desalentador y perturbador que otros seres humanos lleven a cabo un [acto tan bárbaro y cruel](/tags/violencia/)\", reza un comunicado. El gobernador ha reafirmado \"la determinación y compromiso inquebrantables\" de \"controlar la ola de inseguridad en el Estado\", mientras que ha alentado a las fuerzas de seguridad a \"no desanimarse por los ataques a las comunidades\", asegurándoles \"todo el apoyo\". El noreste de [Nigeria](/tags/nigeria/) es el epicentro de las actividades de Boko Haram y su escisión, Estado Islámico en África Occidental (ISWA), si bien la inseguridad se ha extendido a otras zonas del centro, el norte y el noroeste, haciendo saltar las alarmas sobre la posible expansión de estas redes terroristas y criminales.

    "title": "Dentsply Sirona Ends Zafran's Long Wait",
    "text": "Dentsply Sirona Ends Zafran's Long Wait\nNo one is too remote for Smile Train and our partners\nWhen Zafran was born, his cries mixed with the songs of the tropical birds outside his house and the cries of the midwives within. He was born with a cleft. His parents and nine-year-old sister loved him unconditionally, but they had no idea how to get him the support that he needed. All they had was hope that someday, help would come.\nRight away, complications arose. Zafran’s cleft made him choke on milk when his mother tried to feed him. She did her best to keep calm and experiment with new ways to nourish him, even as he screamed with hunger and looked to be wasting away in front of her.\nYustiwizarto, Zafran’s father, earned so little money from his work as an elementary school teacher that the family couldn’t afford electricity for their home. They felt helpless to do anything about Zafran’s cleft, but persisted. Through their will and faith, Zafran grew up underweight and with some speech issues, but otherwise healthy.\nUnfortunately, Zafran still had major challenges ahead of him. There were always rumors circulating around their community, and once he started school, his classmates mocked him without mercy. It spurred Yustiwizarto to hasten his search to find his son the care he so needed.\nHis efforts were rewarded soon after, when one of his brothers in another village messaged the family WhatsApp group that free cleft surgery was available at Ibnu Sina Pekanbaru, one of the major hospitals in their province. Yustiwizarto reached out to the hospital at once, and received a response at once.\nThe hospital explained that, because Ibnu Sina partners with an organization called Smile Train, Zafran’s surgery would be performed by a highly trained team of local experts — and would be completely free thanks to Smile Train’s generous donors around the world and to Dentsply Sirona, the world’s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies.\nIn September of 2021, Smile Train and Dentsply Sirona launched a five-year partnership aimed at improving access to global oral health and creating a brighter, more sustainable future for cleft-affected children and families worldwide.\nThough our collaboration has many concentrations, everything we do together revolves around one goal: bringing the highest global standard of care to every person in need, no matter where they live or how much they earn.\nWhen the day for Zafran’s surgery came, both father and son were jittery: Yustiwizarto because he was so nervous, Zafran because he was so excited.\n“Zafran is always excited,” Yustiwizarto laughs, but he had good reason to be: The nine-year-old knew he was soon to be able to smile with confidence and, for the first time, eat whatever he wanted without fear of it getting stuck inside his nasal cavity.\nWhile Zafran was in the operating room, each tick of the waiting room clock brought Yustiwizarto something new to be nervous about.\nWhen he heard his name called at last, Yustiwizarto jumped from his chair as though on a spring and followed an inch behind the nurse as she led him into the recovery room.\nWhere he praised God for the miracle laying woozy before him.\nZafran’s whole community squeezed themselves into the family’s tiny house to celebrate his transformation — and to see it for themselves.\nThese days, Zafran has lots of friends, and many of them don’t realize that he ever had a cleft at all. He will never forget, however. From the moment he first looked at himself in the mirror after his surgery, he has had one ambition: to grow up to become a doctor so that he, too, can help answer the prayers of children and families in need.\nAnd Yustiwizarto is no less dedicated to helping others in his situation find the free help their children need. “I want to tell parents who have children with clefts not to be afraid since there are services out there to help you. You should immediately find the information they need to get free surgery.\n“I also want to thank the kindhearted staff at Ibnu Sina Pekanbaru who helped us, Smile Train donors, and Dentsply Sirona for making my child’s surgery possible.”\nYou can give a second chance to a child in need today.",

Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nThousands of government supporters on Thursday flocked to the memorial service for senior Iranian commander Seyed Razi Mousavi, who Tehran says was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Syria.\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was among the many high-ranking politicians and officers attending the burial service at a Shiite shrine in Tehran, according to Iranian state media.\nMousavi, from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed on Monday in a suspected Israeli airstrike on a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus.\nThe leadership in Tehran has vowed to avenge his death.\nIRGC commander-in-chief Hossein Salami repeated old threats against Israel during a speech at the service.\n\"Our revenge is always bitter. But a revenge equivalent to the martyrdom of Seyed Razi is nothing less than erasing this Zionist regime from the pages of history,\" the IRNA news agency quoted the Salami as saying.\nIran's leadership has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel, its declared arch-enemy since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\nAccording to the New York Times, Mousavi is said to have helped monitor weapons deliveries to Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, which is backed by Iran and has repeatedly launched attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas since the beginning of the Gaza war.\nIsrael frequently attacks locations in war-torn Syria to prevent Iran from further expanding its military influence in the region via local militias.\nMousavi was a confidant of the powerful IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by the US in a drone attack in Iraq in 2020.\nMousavi had decades of military experience in Syria and Lebanon. Although little was previously known about the general, he was considered one of the most influential officers of the Revolutionary Guard abroad.\nIran, alongside Russia, is the most important ally of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Tehran considers Syria to be part of the so-called \"axis of resistance\" in its fight against Israel, alongside Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\nAccording to Tehran, however, Iranian military personnel are not directly involved in the Syrian civil war and act only as advisers.\nView comments",

    "title": "SurgePays: Convenience Store Strategy Is Working",
    "text": "While its business likely won't ever command a high multiple, SurgePays (NASDAQ:\nSURG) has some nice growth prospects as it increases its convenience store distribution network and continues to improve gross margins.\nCompany Profile\nSURG is a fintech and telecom provider serving underbanked and low-income customers. It offers prepaid, wireless, and financial products to consumers who don’t have access to checking accounts and credit cards, using convenience stores as its main point of distribution.\nThe company has an FCC license to provide subsidized wireless services to qualifying individuals through the Affordable Connectivity Program (\"ACP\"). The program provides a $30 per month subsidy for each customer for mobile broadband, as well as $100 for each LTE-enabled tablet distributed. SURG provides these services through two MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) subsidiaries, Torch and SurgePhone. It is also launching a prepaid wireless brand called LinkUp Mobile. Surge and Torch currently make up about 85% of its revenue.\nThe company’s fintech platform, meanwhile, offers a variety of financial and prepaid products, which it states helps convert the corner grocery store into a tech hub for the underbanked. Through this platform, it sell things such as gift cards, mobile phones, wireless top-up refills, and other mobile related products.\nThe company also has several other businesses, including a wholesale e-commerce platform. Its LogicsIQ business, meanwhile, is a lead generation business serving law firms in the mass tort industry, which are lawsuits with multiple plaintiffs. It also owns 40% of Centercom, a bilingual IT and support firm based in El Salvador. It is, however, winding down the LogicsIQ businesses.\nOpportunities and Risks\nThe vast majority of SURG’s business is its mobile broadband and prepaid businesses. Driving customers and continuing to scale this business is the company’s business opportunity.\nWithin this business, most of it is its ACP business, where the government subsidizes the program to bring affordable internet to lower income households. SURG gets a nice $30 per month per subscriber with at an attractive 60% gross margin, but that is before some other costs with selling the product.\nIn the past, the company’s margins in this segment have been pretty weak. Thus, one opportunity is increasing the margins of the mobile broadband business, which the company has been doing. Mobile broadband gross margins in Q3 went from 11.2% to 35.2%. The improvement has come as the company has shifted its distribution point of these plans. SURG originally sold these plans through pop-up tents, before moving to the convenience store channel. The company said this slowed sales, but that the economics were much better. The reason was that SURG was paying about $50 per activation to pop-up tent owners, whose sole source of income was from this, compared to $10-12 to convenience store owners. In addition, with a physical location that can customers can be stickier, as there is a place to go if any issues arise.\nThe cost of revenue also consists of data plan expense and royalties. Adding more subs can also help on this end, as it allows the company’s MVNO to get better rates from AT&T (\nT) and T-Mobile.\nNow ACP plans have their limits, as it is limited to one person per qualifying household. Thus, with a strong foothold in the ACP market, the launch of the company's new LinkUp Mobile prepaid brand could be a nice growth driver. With over 100 million prepaid wireless consumers in the United States, the company will look to piggyback on its success in the ACP market to drive more growth.\nExpanding its network of convenience stores is another potential driver for SURG. Increased distribution is the key to many consumer facing businesses, and SURG is no exception. Last reported, the company had made inroads into over 8,000 of convenience stores, but there are over 150,000 of these stores operating in the United States, according to the 2023 NACS/NielsenIQ Convenience Industry Store Count. That’s a lot of white space in front of it.\nIn addition, once in these stores, SURG will look not only to sell mobile broadband, but fintech products as well. It’s also looking to better promote its offering within stores. Traditionally it has used posters in stores to advertise, but it has started to roll out customer facing LCD screens made by ClearLine at the register to promote its products and allow eligible users to sign up for the Federal ACP program and conduct wireless activations or prepaid top-up transactions from this new tablet. It eventually hopes to be able to offer loyalty rewards, discounts, and other QR code-driven payments.\nOverall, SURG’s strategy has been working well. For its Q3 reported\nin November, the company grew its EBITDA from a loss of -$0.8 million to $7.5 million. Overall gross margins surged to 30.7% from 5.3%. The company posted a profit of $7.1 million versus a loss of -$1.5 million a year ago. Revenue fell -5.5% to $34.2 million, but would have risen by about 6.5% excluding the LogisticsIQ business it is exiting.\nThrough the first nine months of the year, the company has generated $18.9 million in EBITDA and generated over $8 million in free cash flow.\nLooking at its balance sheet, SURG had $12.7 million in cash and $5.1 million in debt. Given its free cash flow, positive EBITDA, and debt cash on the balance sheet, the company looks to be in sound financial position without any immediate financing needs given its low historical capex.\nWhen it comes to risks, the biggest would be any changes to the ACP program. Right now, SURG and its low-income customers are dependent on this government subsidy program. If it were to be eliminated or reduced, it would be a major blow to the company.\nThe macroeconomy is another risk the firm faces. SURG’s customers are lower-income, and thus more at risk during a weak economy. While most of its revenue is derived from the ACP program and thus not really impacted, areas such as prepaid wireless and fintech could be impacted. While a smaller part of the pie and not currently carrying very robust margins, fintech revenue was down -34% so far for 2023. showing how the economy can impact this part of the business.\nCompetition is also a risk. There is no lack of companies that offer mobile internet at a $0 cost through the ACP program. I quick search in my area from the\nAffordable Connectivity Program website showed about 35 companies offering free service under the ACP program. Thus, the moat for SURG isn’t particularly wide, and its success really will depend on its convenience store strategy.\nCEO Kevin Cox also owns over 30% of the shares outstanding, so he has much control over the company. This also lowers the float on what is already a pretty low market cap company, so it will be difficult for it to attract institutional investors.\nValuation\nSURG trades around 3.6x the 2023 consensus adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 million and 2.8x the 2023 consensus of $34.1 million.\nThe company has 5.6 million warrants outstanding with a $4.99 exercise price. That would boost its EV/EBITDA for 2024 to 3.1x.\nIt trades at a forward PE of 4.9x the 2023 consensus of $1.46. Based on 2024 analyst estimates of $1.91, it trades at 3.7x.\nSURG is projected to growth its revenue 14.5% in 2023 and about 6.3% in 2024.\nThere aren’t many great comparable for SURG, although it is in the type of business I wouldn’t expect to get a huge multiple given a lack of moat. I think 4-6x 2024 EBITDA would be appropriate given its EBITDA growth, cash flow, and balance sheet. That would value the company at between $8.60-$12.00. The midpoint is $10.30. The fair value range takes into account its warrants.\nConclusion\nSURG has been doing a lot of good things to improve its margins and profitability since it uplisted to the NASDAQ in 2021. The move towards selling ACP mobile internet plans through convenience stores appears to be a nice move that is much more economical and sticky. With its penetration here still modest, it should have a long runway to grow while also expanding services to its core low-income customer base.\nSURG is not likely ever going to command a huge multiple, but it’s a nice little business that has room to grow and expand. It’s a higher risk-reward type of stock, but I’m going to start it with a “Buy” rating. My target is $10.50, which is some attractive upside from here.\nEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.",

    "text": "Calor\nAmnesia climática: las altas temperaturas de los últimos dos años alteran nuestra percepción del calor\nLos expertos afirman que la percepción general del calor ha cambiado por las altas temperaturas sufridas en los últimos dos años.\nPublicidad\nEn los últimos dos meses, es raro que alguien no haya escuchado a algún amigo o conocido comentar cómo \"este verano no está haciendo calor\" o \"el verano pasado sí que fue caluroso\".\nEstos comentarios se han expandido rápidamente, haciendo que se plantee la duda de si realmente este verano está siendo menos cálido que otros. ¿Nos hemos olvidado de lo que era el calor antes de hace dos años? Pues la realidad es que los expertos ya están hablando de \"amnesia climática\".\nUn término acuñado por el psicólogo Peter Kahn que hace referencia a cómo\nel avance de la crisis climática distorsiona por completo nuestra visión de la realidad y nos hace no recordad cosas como, por ejemplo, lo que es un verano normal. Lo achacan a que los más jóvenes no visualizan cómo era el mundo antes del impacto de la crisis climática.\nPara demostrarlo, unos investigadores de la Universidad de California analizó más de 2.000 millones de tuits publicados durante olas de calor en EEUU. Tras analizarlos observaron que la gente pasó de \"Mostrar mucha preocupación sobre el tema\" a prácticamente ignorarlo. Lo que demuestra que nos estamos adaptando a condiciones climáticas tan extremas.\nPero España no se queda atrás en este fenómeno, según muestran los registros históricos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología en los años setenta y ochenta España solía tener una o máximo dos olas de calor al año con una duración de entre tres y cinco días en total. En los últimos 10 años, el número de olas de calor y la duración de estos episodios han aumentado por dos. Han aumentado también el número de provincias afectadas con valores extremos.\nEn 2022 y 2023, los veranos fueron los más extremos desde que se tiene constancia y este año, no se ha llegado a valores tan elevados como los anteriores, pero los datos muestran que estamos muy por encima de lo que es normal para nuestra época.\nVerano trágico en España\nEl verano de 2024 ha dejado una huella trágica en España, según las estimaciones del Instituto de Salud Carlos III, hasta\n771 personas habrían fallecido en el mes de julio por exceso de calor. 85 más que el verano anterior. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) registró marcas históricas en varias ciudades. Barcelona llegó a los 40ºC y en otras ciudades como Zaragoza o Bilbao, hubo mínimas nocturnas altas poco comunes de 28,1º y 21,7º.\nPublicidad",

    "text": "O Serviço Federal de Segurança (FSB) da Rússia entrou com processos criminais contra três jornalistas nesta quinta-feira, 22. Um profissional da CNN e duas ucranianas teriam entrado \"ilegalmente\" no país pela fronteira da Ucrânia para realizar reportagens sobre a incursão ucraniana na região de Kursk, alega a agência.\nA abertura do processo foi informada em um comunicado do FSB, que nomeou Nick Paton Walsh, cidadão britânico e correspondente-chefe de segurança internacional da CNN, além de duas repórteres ucranianas do canal de notícias independente Hromadske, Olesya Borovik e Diana Butsko. Os alvos das investigações não estão na Rússia e podem ser condenados a até cinco anos de prisão.\nAs autoridades russas abriram um processo similar em 17 de agosto contra dois jornalistas do canal italiano RAI, Stefania Battistini e Simone Traini, pelo mesmo motivo.\nOs jornalistas fizeram reportagens na cidade russa de Sudzha, localizada a 10 quilômetros da fronteira com a Ucrânia e que Kiev afirma ter conquistado como parte da ofensiva iniciada na região de Kursk em 6 de agosto.\nO governo russo convocou a embaixadora da Itália em Moscou e uma diplomata dos Estados Unidos para abordar o tema nos últimos dias.\nA Ucrânia iniciou uma incursão no dia 6 de agosto e segue avançando na região russa de Kursk, onde seu exército pretende criar uma \"zona tampão\" para se proteger de ataques. Em paralelo à incursão, Kiev ainda realizou na última quarta-feira, 14, o maior ataque com drones em bases aéreas russas desde o início da guerra. Kiev afirma controlar atualmente 93 localidades e mais de 1.250 quilômetros quadrados. O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, prometeu \"expulsar\" as forças ucranianas da Rússia.
