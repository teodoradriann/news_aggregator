    "title": "AI填志愿\"包录取\"？一味盲从只会耽误自己",
    "text": "近日，随着各地高考分数公布，多个AI大模型纷纷喊话，表示可以帮助考生和家长填报志愿；在社交平台，也出现了很多分享用AI填志愿的帖子，有的还打出“保证录取”“独家内部数据”等旗号。不少网友对此半信半疑：用大模型填志愿，真的靠谱吗？\n图片来源：视觉中国\n查分后，不少考生都会对志愿填报环节感到“头大”。面对互联网上的海量信息，如何梳理出真正适合自己的参考内容，筛选出目标院校和专业？在平行志愿等报考模式下，怎样构建出层次合理的志愿“矩阵”，避免错过心仪院校、报考滑档等失误？对于这些志愿填报需求，AI大模型的确能在一定程度上发挥辅助作用。比如，大模型可以在短时间内高效整合信息，从而免掉不少考生和家长四处翻阅、整理信息之苦，大大提升报考效率。\n只是，AI大模型毕竟存在数据缺陷、真实性存疑等隐患，也未必能囊括值得纳入志愿填报考量的所有重要面向。对考生和家长而言，“不尽信AI”、坚守自我决策的主体性，才是更加审慎、对自我更加负责的态度。\n首先，AI大模型的数据准确性，直接影响最终结论。一直以来，不少专业人士都多次提醒AI幻觉问题的风险。所谓的AI幻觉，是指模型生成的内容与现实世界事实或用户输入不一致的现象。\n具体到AI志愿填报而言，一方面，一些大模型的分析结论看似条分缕析、逻辑清晰，但却可能存在一个致命问题：引用数据不权威、真实性存疑，甚至可能就是系统“胡编乱造”的。另一方面，其梳理的信息与考生真实需求可能并不匹配。比如，全然基于往年数据进行判断，没有充分考虑到考试难度、分数及排名对应关系等变化，从而造成结论偏差。AI幻觉的存在，使得一些志愿填报建议表面看来似乎颇具说服力，实则根本经不起推敲。而考生一旦将报考问题全部交由AI“代劳”，便很可能造成决策偏差。\nAI大模型“投喂”内容的局限性，也可能造成其决策考量不够全面。由于一些老牌院校、传统专业的资料及数据较多，大模型可以充分抓取学习，相关决策就相对更可靠、更具参考性。而有专家指出，由于一些新设大学、新设专业的数据不多，公开信息有限，大模型就很难就学校或专业给出准确的评判，从而使考生错过一些有潜力、立足前沿领域的新兴高校。\n此外，AI大模型在提出志愿填报建议时，更多是基于录取分数、专业前景、就业数据等客观指标。但是一个人对于院校和专业的选择，还会受到个性、地理位置偏好、兴趣点等主观因素的影响。如果只是一味轻信AI判断，便很容易掉入“数字迷思”，忽略对主观偏好的审视。\n可见，AI大模型虽然日渐强大，但当下恐怕还难以被完全委以“志愿决策”的重任。考生和家长从机制上理解大模型的运行逻辑，对其功能优势及局限性做到心中有数，才能善用工具、合理使用，作出真正适合自己的明智决策。例如，在参考大模型建议时，可以注意查看其引用表述是否断章取义、相关数据来源是否权威，并通过人工查验等方式多方验证。此外，面对市面上多种AI大模型，考生和家长不妨多加对比，筛选出相对可靠的参考工具，特别是对那些打着“保证录取”等旗号、涉嫌夸大宣传或偷换概念的平台说“不”。\n与此同时，学校和有关部门也要正视家长及考生的报考需求，通过开放新生常见问题答疑、组织校友交流活动等，尽量减少信息不对称引发的焦虑，让考生更加从容地进行志愿填报。\n撰文/任冠青\n编辑/黄帅\n【责任编辑：黄帅 编辑：袁瑞】",

    "text": "The Office for Air Accident ⁣Analysis, a branch of the Dutch transport inspectorate,‍ is concerned about the ⁣increase in false information transmitted‌ to pilots following the manipulation of GPS systems. This administration‍ recorded 983 cases of “ GPS spoofing ” in the first ten ​months of 2024, 163 in 2023 and almost none in‌ 2022. Enough to jeopardize flight safety, with the receipt of incorrect ​data and incorrect alerts on the location of their device.\nDutch experts do not say where ⁤the accidents occur, but according to data collected on November ⁣20 by the newspaper Fidelity According to the Association of Professional Pilots (VNV), the most frequent accidents occur in⁢ the Balkans, Turkey⁤ and the Middle East. They would also multiply in ⁤Pakistan,‌ North and South Korea, ‍as well as in the United States. Finnish authorities, for their part, suspect that Russia often emits false signals to protect its strategic installations from drone or aircraft​ attacks.\nOther states and rebel groups also disrupt satellites with GPS signals that hijack the correct intelligence they transmit to planes. These actions, mainly intended to deceive military aircraft, nevertheless endanger civil aviation. The various on-board systems provide the crew with false data that can falsely alert ⁤them or, conversely, deprive them of essential information.\n“In the fog” “It⁢ has become a daily problem, it’s like flying in the fog” explained in ‌ Fidelity Coen George, ⁢vice president of the ⁣VNV. Since the beginning of the year, Dutch services have collected 362 cases of manipulated data⁢ telling pilots that their plane was approaching the ground when‍ in reality they were flying at‍ high altitude.\nRead also | Article reserved for our subscribers ​ Air traffic was⁤ disrupted by a global computer ​outage, many flights cancelled Read later\nThese disruptions had no‌ consequences, but their multiplication could lead crews to neglect real warnings or relevant ‌information, judges the VNV. The opportunity is taken to require the maintenance of two pilots on board⁤ each aircraft, while companies and manufacturers support the introduction ‌of co-pilotless flights in the future. The European Cockpit Association,‍ which brings together 40,000 pilots on the continent,‍ is fighting against this⁣ project currently being examined by​ the European ⁤Union Agency for Air Navigation.\nWhat are the implications ⁣of GPS ​spoofing for aviation safety ? Interview between Time.news Editor and‍ GPS‍ Manipulation Expert\nEditor : Good ⁣day, and thank you⁤ for joining us to ⁤discuss a critical issue impacting aviation safety​ today. With us ‌is Dr. Alex Rehn, an expert in aviation security and GPS technology. Dr. Rehn, the recent report from the Office for Air Accident Analysis highlights ‍a staggering ‍increase in cases of GPS spoofing. Can you break down what this means for pilots‌ and ⁢airlines?\nDr. Rehn : Absolutely, and thank you for having⁣ me. ​GPS spoofing essentially involves sending false signals to an aircraft’s GPS system, leading pilots⁢ to receive⁢ incorrect data about their location and route.⁣ This manipulation can‌ result in misleading alerts and situational awareness, jeopardizing flight safety significantly.\nEditor : ⁣That’s alarming, to⁢ say the least. The record shows ​983 instances of GPS​ spoofing within just the first ten months of 2024, compared to only ​163 in 2023 ‌and ‌almost none in 2022. What factors ⁣do you think have contributed ‍to this dramatic rise?\nDr.​ Rehn : Several factors could be at play here. One is the increasing accessibility​ of technology that ‍enables spoofing. With more actors—states, rebel groups, and individuals—gaining ⁢technical capabilities, we see a rise in both frequency and geographical reach of these incidents. Moreover, many⁢ of these spoofing events seem particularly concentrated in regions with ‍geopolitical tensions, such as ​the Balkans, Turkey, and, notably, the Middle East.\nEditor : Interesting. ⁢The report also ​mentions⁤ that Finnish ‍authorities suspect Russia of emitting false signals to ‌protect strategic installations. How common is it for military tactics to spill over into civilian aviation?\nDr. Rehn : Unfortunately, it’s becoming more common.​ Military ‌groups have traditionally ‌disrupted GPS signals to mislead enemy aircraft or drones. However, the challenges arise⁢ when such tactics endanger civilian flights inadvertently. ​The indiscriminate nature of GPS spoofing⁤ means that while the ⁤intention may be to deceive‍ military targets, civil aviation is collateral damage—exposing not just aircraft but also lives to significant risk.\nEditor : It’s sobering to think about the potential ⁣consequences. How do on-board systems ⁤currently cope with these spoofing attempts, and what improvements might we see in the future?\nDr. Rehn : Current systems use a combination of ‌satellite signals and inertial navigation systems to determine an aircraft’s position, but they are not immune to⁢ sophisticated spoofing techniques. Going forward, we need to develop more⁤ resilient navigation systems that can⁣ authenticate signals and detect anomalies ‍in real-time. Additionally, better training for pilots ⁣on how to respond to ⁢discrepancies in GPS information is crucial.\nEditor : That⁤ sounds‌ vital. As a concluding thought, what advice would you give ​to airline companies and piloting organizations in addressing the immediate risks of ⁣GPS spoofing?\nDr. Rehn : First, they should advocate for enhanced security measures, including advanced technology that ⁣can counteract spoofing ⁣attempts. Second, integrating strict protocols for situational awareness can ​help pilots distinguish between genuine and false‌ information. Lastly, fostering collaboration‍ with international aviation authorities is essential to develop a unified⁣ response to this growing threat.\nEditor : Thank you, Dr. Rehn, for shedding ⁤light on such a ‍significant and ​pressing issue in aviation safety. We hope for advancements ⁢that can protect our skies and the people who travel in them.",

    "title": "Data is Key: Implementation of Digital HIV Case Surveillance Program Leads to Tailored Health Service Delivery in Ethiopia",
    "text": "ICAP in Ethiopia is transforming how data is being used to inform HIV programming. Prior to 2019, Ethiopia lacked the necessary digital infrastructure to collect, manage, and analyze HIV surveillance data. This hindered the country’s ability to monitor any changes related to the HIV epidemic, including tracking new HIV cases, identifying high-risk populations, and evaluating intervention strategies. With support from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ICAP led the development and customization of a digital HIV case surveillance system implemented in more than 800 health facilities, enabling data-driven decision-making, targeted interventions, and improved health outcomes. Prior to the development of the program, ICAP, CDC, and other stakeholders conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to identify gaps and challenges in HIV surveillance data collection and management. The largest gap was that health facility data was not disaggregated by population characteristics, limiting the ability to identify high-risk populations and target interventions in a timely manner. The HIV case surveillance program records, manages, and analyzes real-time HIV surveillance data, allowing health facilities, the Ministry of health, and other stakeholders to conduct HIV risk analysis based on socio-demographic factors, such as gender, age, and occupation. The system also tracks and identifies areas where there are the greatest number of new HIV infections, helping teams target programming. Furthermore, the program reports on patient risk factors and utilization of services, such as linkage to care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, including timing. The dashboard flags health facilities with sub-optimal performance so that support can be targeted. “ICAP has been instrumental in establishing a robust HIV case surveillance system in Ethiopia,” said Gemechu Tadesse, director of the HIV/TB Research Directorate at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. “Its technical support, particularly in installing the REDCap server [server associated with the platform] on our premises is essential for virtually managing a huge set of centrally aggregated HIV case surveillance data collected from 800 sites across the country.” “The dashboard allows program managers and policymakers to gain insights into trends and patterns of new HIV diagnoses, identify high-risk populations, and observe clinical features at the time of diagnosis, such as CD4 count and World Health Organization-based clinical stages,” said Tekalign Deressa, HIV case surveillance team lead for ICAP in Ethiopia. In addition to developing the surveillance platform, ICAP provided essential infrastructure support to all health facilities implementing the program, including donation of servers, computers, 3G dongles – plug-in devices that enable Internet connection – and high-capacity automatic backup generators. ICAP provided intensive training for data encoders, managers, and system administrators, enhancing their skills and proficiency in data entry, quality assurance, and adherence to data security protocols. Health care providers were trained on the system’s data visualization dashboard. “The dashboard has enabled us to generate real-time data and identify hotspots of potential ongoing HIV transmission and highlight geographic areas with unmet needs in HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services,” said Ashenafi Birhanu, HIV case provider at the ART Center in Zewditu Memorial Hospital. Since its inception, the platform has contributed to reduced new HIV infections among certain populations, such as long-distance drivers; improvement in linkage to care and initiation of ART over time; and the use of HIV surveillance data, providing crucial local context for advocacy and HIV prevention and control efforts. “The case surveillance data is not merely data,” said Fekadu Yadet, lead executive officer at the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office within the Ministry of Health. “It is a granular-level map, pinpointing hotspots, vulnerabilities, and untold stories across different regions of the country. We are utilizing the data for targeting interventions, allocating resources, and raising public awareness.” “The case surveillance data, disaggregated by age, sex, marital status, profession, and various risk factors, provides valuable insights for the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to design and strategize targeted interventions for high-risk populations,” added Zenebe Melaku, MD, country director of ICAP in Ethiopia. “ICAP remains committed to implementing and expanding the HIV case surveillance project, driving tailored program improvements and achieving maximum impact in the national response to HIV/AIDS.” About ICAP A major global health organization that has been improving public health in countries around the world for two decades, ICAP works to transform the health of populations through innovation, science, and global collaboration. Based at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, ICAP has projects in more than 40 countries, working side-by-side with ministries of health and local governmental, non-governmental, academic, and community partners to confront some of the world’s greatest health challenges. Through evidence-informed programs, meaningful research, tailored technical assistance, effective training and education programs, and rigorous surveillance to measure and evaluate the impact of public health interventions, ICAP aims to realize a global vision of healthy people, empowered communities, and thriving societies.
