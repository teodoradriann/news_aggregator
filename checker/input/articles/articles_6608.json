    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nThe Hindu Religious and Temple Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024, faced defeat in the Karnataka Legislative Council. The vote saw 18 members opposing the bill from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (Secular), with only seven in favor. Despite this setback, Muzrai department minister Ramalinga Reddy, who had actively worked on the bill to benefit less affluent temples, expressed resilience. He stated, “All is not lost. We will put it forth again in the Assembly on Monday.” The outcome occurred amid a low attendance from the treasury benches during the voting at 8 pm.\nNotably, there were few members from the treasury benches present during the 8 pm vote, as per sources familiar with the situation.\nThe primary aim of the Karnataka temple bill is to assist the 35,000 Hindu temples and their associated families with lower incomes. The proposed measure seeks to shift the financial burden from revenue-earning temples to those with lesser income. The additional funds collected are intended to provide support to priests and their children for education and other essential needs.\nHowever, Kota Srinivasa Poojary, the opposition leader in the Council, contended that the government should support poorer temples using its own revenues rather than relying on funds from wealthier temples. The bill mandates a 10% collection from temples with revenue exceeding ₹1 crore and 5% from temples with revenue between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore.\nDuring the bill’s introduction and passage in the Legislative Assembly, the opposition accused the government of using the bill to augment funds for its guarantee schemes. R Ashoka, the Leader of the Opposition in the House, alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was “stealing from the collection boxes of the temples,” asserting that the government sought to collect a “10% commission from the income of the temples.”\nThe Muzrai department oversees around 35,000 temples, with 205 in Group A (income exceeding ₹25 lakh per year), 193 in Group B (income between ₹5 lakh and ₹25 lakh), and around 34,000 in Group C (income below ₹5 lakh).",

A Rodero le Gev della Valle del Lanza li regalano per bonificare lo stagno Centinaia di pesci rossi hanno invaso lo stagno di Rodero nel parco Valle del Lanza e minacciano la sopravvivenza delle specie autoctone. Domenica 18 febbraio le Gev li pescheranno e li regaleranno a chi li vuole per acquari o laghetti privati Singolare offerta pubblicata oggi dalle Gev del Parco Valle del Lanza, che domenica 18 febbraio saranno impegnate a Rodero per “bonificare” lo stagno da centinaia di pesci rossi che hanno invaso il piccolo specchio d’acqua. Pesci che, spiegano le Gev “sono stati riversati da qualche incosciente”. I pesciolini devono essersi trovati bene, tant’è che si sono riprodotti fino a diventare una minaccia: «I pesci sono un pericolo enorme per le uova e le larve dei nostri piccoli anfibi, che daranno inizio alla riproduzione tra pochissimi giorni – spiegano le Gev – Nonostante ciò non vorremmo porre fine alla vita dei pesciolini. Quindi chiediamo a chiunque sia interessato ad avere dei pesci rossi nei propri stagni privati o acquari di presentarsi allo stagno di Rodero domenica 18 febbraio tra le 10.30 e le 11.30. Troverete noi Gev intente nella pesca, e i pesci potranno essere affidati alle persone che li chiederanno». Si consiglia di presentarsi muniti di adeguati contenitori.

    "title": "With Trump as president, can TikTok in the U.S. survive? - Los Angeles Times",
    "text": "The fate of TikTok in the U.S. has been up in the air since 2020, when then-President Trump moved to ban the popular video app because of national security concerns.\nThat set off four years of back-and-forth between the app’s Chinese owners and the U.S. government, with a possible ban scheduled to go into effect one day before Trump’s inauguration in January.\nOne hitch: Trump recently changed his mind, joining TikTok in June and posting on social media , “Those who want to save TikTok in America, vote for Trump.”\nAdvertisement “We’re not doing anything with TikTok,” he said.\nThat has given some creators hope.\n“The fact that Trump did a whole 180 and wants to wait and reassess how everything is going with TikTok — I think we’re going to be OK,” said creator Kat Vera, 34, who posts fitness and car content and has 457,000 followers on TikTok.\nBut there are factors that complicate the app’s position. Several legal experts and tech industry observers said the path forward for TikTok is still precarious.\n“It’s just a huge mess, and it isn’t clear,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.\nAdvertisement\nHollywood Inc.\nTikTok sues U.S. government, saying ban violates 1st Amendment Congress last month passed a law that would ban the popular social video app in the United States unless Chinese owner ByteDance sells it.\nMay 7, 2024 In April, President Biden signed a law passed by Congress that would require TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its ownership of TikTok by Jan. 19 or face a ban in the U.S. due to security concerns about the app’s ties to China.\nBiden has the option to extend ByteDance’s deadline, but some legal experts said that is unlikely. Changing the law would require approval by Congress, they said. Instead, some believe that the matter could be settled in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nTikTok and ByteDance sued the U.S. government in May , alleging that banning the app would violate 1st Amendment rights to freedom of speech and that the new law “offers no support for the idea” that TikTok’s Chinese ownership poses national security risks .\nAdvertisement Experts said they expect that the court will make a decision next month. If the court rules in favor of TikTok and ByteDance, then the law will be declared unconstitutional and the government is unlikely to appeal under the incoming Trump administration.\nBut if the court rules against the app and the tech giant, they could appeal to the Supreme Court and ask to have the new law paused, said Michael Stovsky, a partner at law firm Benesch in Cleveland.\n“They’re gonna probably ask the court to say, ‘Look, don’t enforce the law. Don’t require it to divest until the Supreme Court has heard the case,’” Stovsky said.\nRepresentatives for TikTok and the Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment.\nMusic\nTikTok has been saved. But for music, is that a good thing? TikTok has become the single most important platform for generating new pop-music hits. But can it help mint stars, or just one-hit wonders?\nSept. 23, 2020 In a court filing, TikTok and ByteDance said that they’ve tried to work with the government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to address security concerns since 2019.\nUnder the terms of a deal spelled out in a 90-page draft agreement, information collected about TikTok users in the U.S. was to be handled by U.S. tech giant Oracle . The proposed agreement also called for Oracle to inspect TikTok’s programming code for vulnerabilities and for the platform’s content to be subject to independent monitoring.\nAdvertisement If TikTok did not comply, the draft agreement called for financial penalties and also included the possibility of suspending TikTok’s operations in the U.S. TikTok and ByteDance said it’s unclear why the committee ultimately determined the proposed agreement was insufficient.\nMeanwhile, Trump has changed his tune about TikTok, at least in part for apparently personal reasons and his animus for the app’s rivals. Earlier this year he called himself a “big star on TikTok.”\n“If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in March, referring to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook’s parent company, Meta. “I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!”\nRepublican leaders have accused the social media site of censoring conservative viewpoints , which Facebook disputed, saying it has guidelines that “do not permit the suppression of political perspectives.”\nTrump, who has 14.6 million followers on TikTok, joined the popular video app months after he met with Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor, major Republican Party donor and co-founder and managing partner of Susquehanna International Group, but Trump told CNBC they did not discuss TikTok.\nPeople who had worked for Trump also have joined TikTok’s cause. Club for Growth, a conservative economic organization, hired former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway to advocate for TikTok in Congress, according to Politico.\nAdvertisement But the Trump administration will have to deal with differing viewpoints within the Republican Party on TikTok, with some preferring a hard line toward China.\n“I think it’s going to become a chip in a much larger game involving tariffs with China, security agreements, all that, and that TikTok is going to be part of a bigger equation,” said Freddy Tran Nager, associate director of USC Annenberg’s Digital Social Media master’s program.\nTikTok has a significant presence in Culver City, employing roughly 440 people there, according to city estimates. The company, which has 170 million U.S. users, has been an important content promotion tool for video creators, small businesses, music artists and Hollywood studios.\nEarlier this year, TikTok notified the state of California that it would lay off 58 employees in Culver City in July “due to restructuring.” Positions affected included senior business analysts and global product specialists.\nMany creators have already diversified into publishing their content on other platforms, so they aren’t solely reliant on TikTok. Some say the moneymaking opportunities are better on rival services.\nHollywood Inc.\nAmid the coronavirus lockdown, TikTok gives hope to L.A. entertainers TikTok, a popular based social video app owned by China-based ByteDance, has seen explosive growth this year amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has plans to hire more people, including at its Culver City office.\nMay 6, 2020 Theodora Moutinho, a fitness creator and actor from Glendale, said she has learned to always adapt in the fast-changing world of social media.\nAdvertisement The 25-year-old became a creator in 2017 and today has 4.2 million followers on Instagram, 1.3 million on TikTok and 421,000 on Snapchat. These days, she’s putting more effort into her Snapchat and Instagram accounts, while keeping an eye on newer platforms such as Bluesky.\n“Ever since it was up in the air that they were going to take it off, not take it off, I kind of stopped really focusing on it,” Moutinho said of TikTok. “Because why try to grow something if it might come down?”\nTimes news researcher Scott Wilson contributed to this report.\nMore to Read\nOpinion: The TikTok court case has staggering implications for free speech in America Dec. 9, 2024\nTikTok lost a major legal bid to avoid a U.S. ban.

    "text": "Mehr als 122 Millionen Menschen weltweit auf der Flucht\nKrieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung: Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge weltweit ist in einem Jahr um zwei Millionen gestiegen.\nMehr als 122 Millionen Menschen sind weltweit auf der Flucht vor Krieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung. Damit stieg die Zahl laut Weltflüchtlingsbericht der Vereinten Nationen binnen Jahresfrist um rund zwei Millionen an. Hauptursachen seien große Konflikte wie im Sudan, in Myanmar und in der Ukraine, erklärte das Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR in Genf zur Veröffentlichung am Donnerstag.\nSeit einem Jahrzehnt habe sich das Ausmaß der globalen Flüchtlingskrise immer weiter verschärft. Ende April seien insgesamt 122,1 Millionen Kinder, Frauen und Männer vertrieben gewesen. Doch während sich die Zahl der gewaltsam vertriebenen Menschen in den letzten zehn Jahren fast verdoppelt habe, sei die Finanzierung für das UNHCR heute in etwa auf demselben Niveau wie 2015. Die anhaltenden Kürzungen der humanitären Hilfe seien unhaltbar und machten Menschen auf der Flucht noch verletzlicher.\nAppell von Flüchtlingskommissar Grandi\nFilippo Grandi, der UN-Hochkommissar für Flüchtlinge, forderte die Weltgemeinschaft auf, ihre diplomatischen Anstrengungen zu verdoppeln. Ziel müsse es sein, Frieden zu schaffen und dauerhafte Lösungen für Menschen auf der Flucht zu finden. Ein Hoffnungsschimmer sei die Rückkehr vieler geflüchteter Menschen in ihre Heimatregionen in Syrien in den vergangenen sechs Monaten nach jahrelangem Krieg und Massenvertreibungen.\nContent-Partnerschaft\nDieser Artikel entstand in einer Content-Partnerschaft mit dem Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).\nAufgrund der Rückkehr in Heimatregionen oder -länder sank die Zahl der Vertriebenen laut UNHCR seit dem Jahreswechsel wieder etwas: Ende Dezember hatte sie einen Höchststand von 123,2 Millionen erreicht. Dabei nahmen die Binnenvertriebenen, die vor Konflikten innerhalb des eigenen Landes flüchten müssen, den größten Anteil ein. Ihre Zahl wuchs dem Bericht zufolge bis Ende 2024 um 6,3 Millionen auf 73,5 Millionen. Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge bezifferte das UNHCR Ende 2024 auf 42,7 Millionen. Flüchtlinge verlassen ihr eigenes Land und suchen Schutz in anderen Staaten.\nMit 14,3 Millionen Menschen auf der Flucht hat der Krieg im Sudan den Zahlen zufolge die inzwischen größte Vertreibungskrise der Welt verursacht. Dahinter folgen Syrien (13,5 Millionen Menschen), Afghanistan (10,3 Millionen Menschen) und die Ukraine (8,8 Millionen Menschen).",

    "text": "Nurses and other health workers belonging to Unite in Wales have voted to take strike action over the 2025-26 pay deal.\nThe union today announced that its members had rejected the 3.6% pay offer and urged the Welsh Government to engage in direct negotiations to improve the deal.\n“The Senedd needs to come back with an improved pay offer before it’s too late”\nSharon Graham\nSome 87% of respondents to Unite’s consultation rejected the award and said they would be prepared to take strike action to try to achieve a better and fairer pay increase.\nIt comes as the Welsh Government announced in May that it had accepted the NHS Pay Review Body’s recommendations for 2025-26.\nUnder the deal, nurses and other NHS staff working on Agenda for Change contracts will get a 3.6% uplift backdated to 1 April.\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The government in Wales needs to address critical problems now, and the biggest is the pay and conditions of frontline workers without whom the NHS cannot survive.\n“Workers cannot wait any longer for decent pay and better conditions,” she said.\n“Any further exodus from the workplace will simply see the NHS in Wales fail to function.\n“The Senedd needs to come back with an improved pay offer before it’s too late,” she added.\nUnite has urged the Welsh Government to open up pay negotiations with unions.\nIt warned that, if negotiations do not take place, the union will have no choice but to start the formal industrial action ballot process.\nUnite lead health officer for Wales, Paul Seppman, said: “Our sincere desire is to negotiate a better and much deserved pay increase for our members and NHS staff but our members are prepared to take action if there is no improved award.\n“Morale in the NHS in Wales is at rock bottom. For over a decade staff have seen real terms cuts to their salaries and simply cannot take any more.\n“The Welsh Government must act now to rectify this situation,” said Mr Seppman.\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the strength of feeling of union members over pay and we have worked hard to address that in a very challenging financial context for Wales.\n“We have accepted in full the recommendations made by the independent NHS Pay Review Body and will ensure staff receive both the pay award and back pay as quickly as possible.\n“We continue to work in social partnership with all NHS Wales unions to address our shared ambition of pay restoration in the longer term,” they said.\nNurses and other NHS workers in England are also currently being balloted on the pay offer by their respective unions.\nMeanwhile, nursing unions in Northern Ireland have this week urged the government there to fund the deal, over renewed concerns about falling out of pay parity with their other UK colleagues.\nScottish nurses remain the best paid across the UK, following a two-year 8% pay deal for 2025-26 and 2026-27.",

    "text": "The developer behind 2020 indie darling Art of Rally is working on another off-road driving game—one that blends that title’s calming, minimalist visual design with exploration. It’s called Over the Hill, and if you enjoyed Art of Rally for its chill vibe and less for the racing part, you’re probably going to love this.\nThe game’s announcement trailer hits all those familiar beats of developer Funselektor Labs’ previous work: tall grass and taller trees; sunsets with vibrant, gorgeous gradients; wide-open expanses; long shadows; and treacherous heights. It’s about the journey here, not the destination, and although specifics on gameplay are light at this moment, it sounds like missions will take you all over a map comprising varied biomes and changing climates, with plenty of sights to see and collectibles to hunt down. Dune Casu, the main dev behind the game, says that it was inspired by his experience “journeying across North America in [his] trusty camper van.”\nEven better, players are encouraged to embark on these expeditions with their friends, in a variety of trucks and SUVs paying tribute to iconic models of the 1960s through the ’80s. Art of Rally certainly united a strong cast of unlicensed rally legends, so we’re excited to see what Over the Hill has in its garage. Modifying your vehicles is also said to be critical in negotiating the game’s unique environments and the respective challenges they bring.\nIf this whole thing sounds like aesthetic Snowrunner or Mudrunner to you, you’re not alone and, I’d guess, probably not far off. The thing is, that style of gameplay would seem to be a perfect fit for the peacefulness Funselektor cultivated with Art of Rally. That game never quite clicked with me, personally; it had nothing to do with its quality or ideas, but more that I struggle with top-down racers where I can’t fully see the road ahead of me, and Art of Rally demands absolute precision. I totally get why people loved it—I wished that I did back when it came out—and I’m pretty sure that perspective could work for me at a much slower pace.\nThat said, we don’t yet know how the game will play. One modder actually found a way to enable a behind-the-car chase cam for Art of Rally, and who knows, maybe Funselektor will provide something like that in Over the Hill. The similarly low-poly, minimal-detail look of the terrain causes me to think otherwise, like this game is also intended to be viewed from a distance, but we’ll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. Over the Hill doesn’t yet have a specific release date, but according to Funselektor and publisher Strelka Games, it’s “coming to Steam soon.”\nGot tips? Send ’em to tips@thedrive.com",
