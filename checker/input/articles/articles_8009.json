    "text": "Rick Slayman, the world’s [first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/pig-kidney-transplant-living-person/index.html), was discharged from the hospital Wednesday, two weeks after his operation, Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement. “He is recovering well and will continue to recuperate at home with his family,” the hospital [said](https://twitter.com/MassGeneralNews/status/1775621590182457769) on X, formerly Twitter. In a [statement](https://www.massgeneral.org/news/rick-slayman-discharge-statement) issued by the hospital, Slayman said, “This moment — leaving the hospital today with one of the cleanest bills of health I’ve had in a long time — is one I wished would come for many years. Now, it’s a reality and one of the happiest moments of my life.” Slayman, a 62-year-old manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, had previously said his doctors suggested that he try a pig kidney when he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. People are also reading… His doctors said last month that they thought Slayman’s new kidney could last years but also acknowledged that there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. His surgery is the third such xenotransplant of a pig organ into a living human. The first two transplants were hearts transplanted into living patients that had run out of other transplant options. The organs were transplanted under special rules that permit compassionate use of experimental therapies for patients in especially dire situations. Both patients died weeks after receiving their organs. Slayman said he was grateful for the response to his surgery, especially from other patients who are waiting for a kidney transplant. The need for organs far outstrips the number that are available. Every day 17 people die in the U.S. waiting for an organ. Kidneys are the organ in shortest supply. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waitlist for those organs. ”Today marks a new beginning not just for me, but for them, as well,” Slayman said in the statement. ___ More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times Heart transplant Heart and lung transplant Intestine transplant Kidney and pancreas transplant Liver transplant",

    "text": "In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, leveraging data analytics has become the key to unlocking unprecedented marketing success. Our experts share ‌fifteen valuable insights, starting with enhancing email campaigns and concluding with strategies for long-term campaign success. Dive into these data-informed tactics and elevate your digital marketing strategies to the next level.\nOptimizing Email Campaigns with Data Insights Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights Creating Effective Retargeting Campaigns Improving the Checkout Process with A/B Testing Focusing on High-Converting Long-Tail Keywords Aggregating Data for Multichannel Campaigns Tailoring Content to Audience Pain Points Prioritizing Mobile vs. Desktop Enhancing SEO with Content Performance Metrics Patching Revenue Leaks in Email Automation Personalizing B2B Social Media Content Redesigning a Pricing Page for Better Conversions Adjusting Ad Placements Based on Data Testing and Learning with New Marketing Tactics Finding Long-Term Campaign Success Optimizing Email Campaigns with Data Insights In digital marketing, data analytics play a crucial role in shaping and refining our strategies. By analyzing metrics such as customer behavior, engagement rates, and conversion patterns, we can make informed decisions that drive more effective campaigns. For instance, we regularly track email marketing performance, including open rates, click-through rates, and unsubscribe patterns.\nA recent example comes from optimizing one of our email campaigns. Initially, we noticed that certain segments of our audience were not engaging as expected. By digging into the data, we identified patterns showing that our messaging wasn’t resonating with specific age-groups. Based on this insight, we personalized the content and timing for those segments. As a result, we saw a 20% improvement in engagement and a notable increase in conversions. This data-driven adjustment not only enhanced the campaign’s overall performance but also strengthened our understanding of what content resonates best with different customer segments.\nDivya Ghughatyal\nDigital Marketing Consultant, Gleantap\nTransforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights All successful marketing strategies these days are built around strong data analytics. The key is being able to transform the raw data we have at our fingertips into actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions. By employing methodologies such as hyper-specific customer segmentation, predictive analytics, and A/B testing, we can tailor our marketing efforts to specific audience needs and behaviors.\nIn our work with e-commerce companies, for example, the data analytics we perform involves examining customer data, website interactions, sales figures, and social media metrics, among other areas. A concrete example of how this detailed analysis has translated into real-world actions for us is in segmentation and personalization. For one of our clients, a cosmetics retailer specializing in moisturizers, we noticed high traffic from our menopause segment, but also that the group had a much higher bounce rate than younger women. We applied A/B testing on landing pages with targeted imagery and messaging for the skin complaints most associated with menopause and saw a 14% jump in conversion rates in that age group within the first two months.\nData-driven marketing strategies not only enhance customer engagement and satisfaction but, in our experience, also drive sales and improve overall marketing effectiveness. By leveraging data-driven insights, the company ensures its marketing efforts are both impactful and efficient, ultimately leading to a stronger market position.\nJames Kinsley\nFounder, Incendium AI\nCreating Effective Retargeting Campaigns Our whole marketing strategy is based on data-driven insights. Data analytics helps us move beyond guesswork, allowing us to make decisions according to tangible numbers.\nWe analyze marketing data across multiple channels—paid ads, social media, organic, and email campaigns—to identify trends, gaps, and make adjustments based on what’s working or what doesn’t. We also analyze the data to see which channels and messages resonate most with our target audience.\nA specific digital marketing insight we gained through data analysis involved retargeting campaigns. We noticed that users who interacted on our website but didn’t immediately sign up were far more likely to convert if they were shown retargeting ads within 48 hours. This prompted us to create a dedicated retargeting funnel with time-sensitive offers and personalized messaging, tailored to the content users had engaged with.\nAs a result, we saw a 20% increase in conversions from these users, along with a decrease in our overall cost per lead, proving the value of retargeting those who had already shown interest in our product.\nKinga Fodor\nHead of Marketing, PatentRenewal.com\nImproving the Checkout Process with A/B Testing I use data analytics to shape my digital marketing strategies by closely monitoring key metrics and customer behaviors. One example that stands out was when I was monitoring search performance for one of our clients. I noticed the website traffic was high, but conversion rates were low. Diving into the data, I discovered that a significant number of visitors were dropping off during the checkout process.\nWith this insight, I implemented A/B testing on our checkout page. We tested different layouts and simplified the process based on user feedback and behavior data. After a few weeks, it was clear that the streamlined checkout led to a 25% increase in conversions.\nThis experience reinforced the importance of being data-driven. By using analytics to identify specific pain points, I can make informed adjustments that directly improve the campaign performance. I made it a habit to regularly analyze customer data to stay ahead of trends and refine strategies, ensuring we’re always meeting our audience’s needs. It’s like having a compass guiding us in the right direction!\nKate Dzhevaga\nCMO, Head of Growth, SYMVOLT\nFocusing on High-Converting Long-Tail Keywords As an SEO specialist, data analytics is at the core of my digital marketing strategies. One way I use it is by closely monitoring keyword performance, user demographics, and website traffic patterns to identify trends and opportunities for improvement. For example, we ran a campaign targeting long-tail keywords for one of our chatbot services and used data-analytics tools to track which terms were driving the most traffic and conversions.\nThrough this analysis, we discovered that while general chatbot-related terms brought in high traffic, niche phrases, like “chatbots for e-commerce,” converted at a significantly higher rate. Based on this insight, we shifted our content strategy to focus more on specific industry use cases of chatbots, particularly in e-commerce, healthcare, and customer support. This adjustment resulted in a 40% increase in leads from organic search within two months.\nData analytics enabled us to make smarter decisions that aligned with customer intent, leading to more efficient spending on ad budgets and improved campaign performance. It’s an indispensable tool for refining strategies in real-time and achieving better ROI on marketing efforts.\nAzam Mohamed Nisamdeen\nFounder, Convert Chat\nAggregating Data for Multichannel Campaigns In a world of tightening budgets and lengthening sales cycles, data-driven decision-making is worth its weight in gold.\nStart by aggregating the data you have: this is where an integrated CRM like HubSpot is absolutely invaluable. By connecting every sales and marketing channel and event to a central data repository, you can get a better picture of how each effort and channel is informing others. You can also get an idea of how your data is trending, and make proactive efforts to detect (and stop) downward spirals or pivot to your most successful channels.\nFor example, in a recent integrated/multichannel campaign, we launched ads, emails, direct SDR outreach via phone, senior sales rep activities & outreach for key accounts, and supporting organic social content targeted to all contacts using HubSpot. By aggregating all this data in one source of truth, and adding both the marketing and sales metrics into one campaign dashboard, it was easy to see which channels were leading to conversions and which channels were supporting our lead nurture and brand awareness plays. Then, we were able to double down on what was working best to maximize our conversion outcomes. The result was a successful, streamlined campaign with no wasted time or manual effort, and a good bump in new deals.\nMadonna Kilpatrick\nDigital Marketing Director, Peer Sales Agency\nTailoring Content to Audience Pain Points At TruBridge, leveraging data analytics is central to how we inform and shape our digital marketing strategies. By closely analyzing key metrics—such as website traffic, engagement rates, conversion rates, and user behavior across various channels—we’re able to make data-driven decisions that maximize the effectiveness of our campaigns. Using tools like Google Analytics and HubSpot, we track performance in real-time, allowing us to identify what’s working, what’s not, and how we can optimize for better results.\nA specific example of how data-driven insights improved our decision-making came from a content marketing campaign aimed at promoting our revenue cycle management (RCM) solutions. Initially, we created a variety of blog posts, whitepapers, and email campaigns around the topic, but early on, we noticed that certain content wasn’t generating the level of engagement we had anticipated.\nUsing data analytics, we dug deeper into user behavior and discovered that our audience was spending significantly more time on blog posts and pages that addressed specific pain points related to claim denials and payment delays, rather than broad, general content on RCM. Armed with this insight, we shifted our focus and produced more targeted content, such as case studies and step-by-step guides that directly addressed these key concerns.\nAs a result, we saw a marked improvement in our engagement rates and conversions. Traffic to the newly created content pages increased by 40%, and the leads generated from this segment of the campaign were more qualified, as they aligned closely with the challenges our target audience was trying to solve. The data-driven shift in strategy not only improved campaign performance but also helped us better tailor our messaging to meet our audience’s needs. This experience reaffirmed the importance of continuously monitoring and responding to data insights to optimize marketing efforts for greater impact.\nSandra Stoughton\nDirector, Marketing Operations, TruBridge\nPrioritizing Mobile vs. Desktop We sell high-ticket health-education courses, so our funnels are longer, and we nurture our leads through rich content. We wanted to optimize our budget, spending money only on improvements with the biggest impact.\nTo do so, we analyzed our website traffic sources and conversion rates across the different pages in our funnel. We found that most qualified leads were opting into our funnels on mobile, but most sales were happening on desktop. We then utilized heat maps, click maps, and other data sources to understand current user behavior and find the greatest areas of opportunity for improvement.\nThen, we were able to prioritize page improvements from mobile for our top-of-funnel pages and improvements from a desktop view for our middle- and bottom-of-funnel pages. Some of these improvements included page speed, hero section design, headline, button, and sales copy. This led to an uplift in both leads and revenue while utilizing our marketing budget with efficiency.\nRebecca Fernandez\nMarketing Optimization Manager\nEnhancing SEO with Content Performance Metrics My team and I use data analytics to track content engagement for SEO and content strategy. We consistently review content-performance metrics, revealing that blog posts and case studies highlighting real-time shipment visibility and post-purchase experience themes perform well, with more engagements and time spent on the page.\nUsing these insights, we doubled down on our content-creation efforts around these topics. We expanded further to include related keywords that users enter into search engines when researching these topics.\nThe result has been improved traffic to our blog and more engagement with our content. We also noted a sharp increase in click-through for social media posts that promote our latest blogs and case studies.\nSteve Yang\nCro, TrackingMore\nPatching Revenue Leaks in Email Automation At our conversion copywriting agency, we’ve found that performance analytics is one of five core pillars needed to shape winning strategies for web work and email-marketing development.\nFor example, an analytics review helped us spot a revenue leak in a tech company’s email-marketing automation. While the automation was consistently generating a healthy five-figure monthly revenue, the more granular performance analytics showed there was a revenue leak. We quickly flagged the revenue leak to the client and got it patched up. The eye-opener? We calculated they’d missed out on approximately $60K in sales by not optimizing the email sooner.\nRemember, keep an eye on your performance data—even in the areas of your funnel which seem to perform well. Seemingly small optimizations can quickly add up.\nCarolyn Beaudoin\nFounder, Head of Creative Strategy, Boxcar Agency\nPersonalizing B2B Social Media Content We’ve been focusing a lot more on personalizing our B2B social media content to directly address the industries our audience belongs to. Instead of posting generic content, we analyzed our entire follower list using ChatGPT, categorizing them by sector and industry. This tactic has allowed us to start creating content that’s much more personal to our audience’s specific challenges and interests.\nAs a result, we have seen a 60% increase in search appearances, a 40% rise in followers, and a 113% increase in post impressions over just 3 months.\nGatis Viskers\nFounder & CEO, Ambition Digital\nRedesigning a Pricing Page for Better Conversions We heavily rely on data analytics to drive our digital marketing strategies, using a combination of web analytics, customer-behavior data, and campaign-performance metrics to make informed decisions. This data-driven approach allows us to continually refine our tactics and allocate resources more effectively.\nOne notable example of how data-driven insights improved our campaign performance was during a recent product launch. Our analytics revealed that a significant portion of our website visitors were dropping off on the pricing page. By digging deeper into the data, we discovered that users were spending an unusually long time on this page, suggesting confusion or hesitation. We used this insight to redesign the pricing page, simplifying the information and adding an interactive pricing calculator.\nWe also created targeted content addressing common questions identified through search queries. The result was remarkable—we saw a 30% increase in conversion rates from the pricing page and a 20% reduction in sales cycle length. This data-driven optimization not only improved our campaign performance but also enhanced the overall user experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction.\nI suggest implementing a robust tracking system that covers all touchpoints of your customer journey. Regularly conduct data deep-dives to identify patterns and anomalies in user behavior. Don’t just look at surface-level metrics—combine data from multiple sources to get a comprehensive view.\nFor instance, pair website analytics with CRM data to understand how online behavior correlates with actual sales outcomes. Use these insights to create hypotheses, then test and iterate quickly. The goal isn’t just to collect data, but to turn it into actionable insights that drive tangible improvements in your marketing strategies.\nJay Natividad\nSEO Exec – Partnership Outreach & Growth, Dialpad\nAdjusting Ad Placements Based on Data We use data analytics to fine-tune our strategies by monitoring key metrics, like audience engagement, click-through rates, and conversions. A great example is when we recently launched a digital PR campaign and used data to pinpoint which social-media channels resonated most with our target audience.\nAs we analyzed trends in behavior, we adjusted our ad placements and content, which led to a 30-percent boost in engagement and a higher conversion rate for the client’s product launch. This data-driven approach not only informed our decisions but also helped us quickly pivot to get the best results.\nKristin Marquet\nFounder, Tech/Analytics/PR Expert, Academic Finance Background, Marquet Media\nTesting and Learning with New Marketing Tactics For incorporating data analytics into our clients’ marketing strategies, it all comes back to a test-and-learn process. Whether we’re trying a brand-new platform or continuing with established tactics, any change requires monitoring a “test” of initial data and then using that data to learn how to move forward.\nOn a micro level, for example, even small changes like swapping in new creatives on a tried-and-true ad platform still require a form of test-and-learn. The first few days after an ad launch act as a performance test, helping us learn if the new creative is performing better than previous ads, meeting or exceeding benchmarks, generating positive or negative user comments, etc., and we’ll respond accordingly.\nOn a macro level, if you’re considering adding another marketing tactic into your mix, data will be crucial to measuring the tactic’s success. This happened to us when we wanted to utilize Google Ads’ new Performance Max (PMax) campaign type. Within H+G’s client roster, we had multiple clients that were running a combination of Google Search Ads, YouTube Ads, and Google Display Network ads, making them seem like ideal candidates for PMax.\nBut before we dove all in, we launched PMax campaigns for a short testing period to gather data and decide if this new technique was successful. It turned out Performance Max wasn’t universally the right move for clients with a diverse Google Ads strategy. For one of our high-end CPG clients, the switch from individual search, YouTube, and display campaigns to Performance Max (which automatically optimized across these placements with little manual control) actually decreased ROAS.\nThrough the use of impression share, auction insights, competitor insights, and search term data, we realized that utilizing PMax meant less control over the specific keywords we bid on, leading our ads to compete with large national retailers who sell low-end versions of the products we were promoting.\nEx: Bidding on “retinol” keywords through PMax put our high-end specialty brand in competition with the line of low-cost retinol products offered at Target. In the end, we came to the conclusion that PMax may not be the best fit for a brand operating in a broad market like beauty, where a product category can vary wildly in retailers and price points. Dabbling with PMax was a nice reminder that instinct can only take you so far, and even the most seasoned of marketers should always use data to support their strategy.\nTegan Jenner\nMedia + Insights Lead, Helen + Gertrude",

    "text": "Policemen from the Quezon City Police District take time out from their routine and made all those who have 'green thumbs' initiate urban farming and gardening, to make their headquarters environment-friendly through 'Project Green Camp Karingal'.\nLaunched in 22 January just this year, the over five-hectares headquarters now has a lash of greenery. From ornamental to fruit-bearing trees and even vegetation, one would not think that in the middle of a busy city, lies a green camp.\n“This is in support of the advocacy of Mayor Joy (Belmonte),” QCPD director Brig. Gen. Redrico Maranan told the Daily Tribune, noting that his command is adopting the Mayor's programs to protect the environment.\nMaranan said the QCPD, along with the Quezon City local goverment, just wanted to express their readiness to make progress in promoting sustainability, environmental responsibility, and the comprehensive well-being of the camp residents.\nAfter that launch, Maranan ordered that every corners, vacant lots and all available space should be planted with threes and various vegetation.\nNotably having the green thumbs are the members of his Special Weapons And Tactics unit where a vegetable garden greets would be visitors at their entrance.\nPlanted tomatoes are beginning to have ready-to-harvest edible berries with other vegetables plants such as egg-plants, okras, pechays and even sitaws (string beans) are also into sprouts.\nNot to be outdone are the cops who maintained the grand stand where the command held it's regular flag raising and other important ceremonies.\nAt the side of the back of that big field are ornamental and fruit-bearing trees like Narra, Mahogany, Talisay, Coconut, Mango, Umbrella, Paper, Sampaloc, Cacao, Guyabano, Guava, Santol, Acacia, Mabolo, Bignay, Caimito, Ipil-Ipil and even Pine trees. In a matter of years, this trees will surely shield audiences of every event that will be held at the grandstand.\nThe trees were planted by Maranan's Command Group or the Chief District Directorial Staffs composed of high-ranking officials occupying sensitive position who also took time to have their own tree planted and watered regularly.\nThe District Mobile Force Battalion whose members you see patrolling the city streets on the other end, not only have their own vegetable garden but unique rain water catching drums for recycling.\nThey have bell pepper, onions and mint, added to their own vegetable garden.\nThe District Drug Enforcement Unit also had their vegetation planted in uniformed pots with siling labuyo, patola and ampalaya.\nMaranan said he has already ordered that the QCPD’s 16 police stations should replicate the initiative.\nHe also told the Stations' Commanders to devise ways how to store rainwater for recycling like flushing toilets, watering plants and cleaning their stations.\nMaranan added that the initiative is also part of the Philippine National Police's core value, \"Makalikasan,\" (Pro-Environment).\n\"This is also to show that the command is line with not only the Mayor but also the PNP's environmental advocacy and is committed to upholding environmental laws protecting the planet,\" the police chief pointed out.\nMaranan also ordered the utilization of solar panels and energy-saving lights. A number of solar posts have already been placed around the camp.\nAmong the activities under the project is the implementation of solid waste segregation and management practices and embracing the 3Rs, Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle concept.\nIn addition, the project enforces \"No Plastic and No Styro Policies,\" that minimize if not eradicate the use of bottled water and styrofoam food containers to reduce plastic wastes and instead use water dispensers and paper cups.\nMoreover, Maranan added 'Project Green Camp Karingal' \"highlighted the unwavering dedication of QCPD personnel in actively participating in urban farming or gardening.\"",

    "text": "A photo taken in Monaco in July stirred intense backlash online. Shared in the r/yachtporn subreddit, the image shows the Katara, a 408-foot docked superyacht. \"Biggest yacht I've ever seen,\" the Reddit user who posted it wrote. Built in 2010 by Lürssen Yachts and owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the former emir of Qatar, the Katara is reportedly worth around $400 million . Its exterior was designed by Espen Øino International, and the lavish interiors were created by the late designer Alberto Pinto. Despite their glitz and glamour, superyachts have long been lightning rods for criticism , especially as awareness grows around the outsize impact of luxury lifestyles on our planet. According to a 2024 report by Oxfam, superyachts and private jets used by Europe's wealthiest emit more pollution in a single week than the world's poorest 1% creates in an entire lifetime. One ultra-rich individual cruising on a yacht like Katara can emit as much carbon pollution in a year as an average European would over nearly 600 years. That contrast is striking, especially considering that the communities most affected by rising temperatures, flash floods, and food insecurity often contribute the least to the problem. Photos such as this one don't just showcase wealth. They spotlight a widening emissions gap , with everyday people encouraged to make sustainable swaps while the world's wealthiest continue polluting at excessive rates. Thankfully, more climate-conscious options are emerging. Some companies, including Sailcargo , are building zero-emission cargo ships powered entirely by wind. Others are developing electric boats that cut down on harmful air pollution. Do you think billionaires spend their money wisely? Definitely No way Some do Most do Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. But these solutions need support, both through policy and a shift in values. For many, including commenters, the yacht's sheer scale and extravagance isn't awe-inspiring; it's offensive. \"How hideous. Enough already,\" one user commented . \"I'm not impressed,\" another added .
