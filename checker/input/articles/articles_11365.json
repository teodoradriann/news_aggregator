    "text": "T he stock market ended 2023 on a positive note and is poised to have another year of gains as investors look to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in the coming months.\nA lot has changed in just the past few months to arrive at that happy situation. While the Fed was once signaling rates would be higher for longer, part of a post-COVID-19 pandemic strategy to tame inflation, investors are now pricing in up to six rate cuts over the next year. And Fed officials are taking on a little more dovish tone. That is because recent inflation reports have shown meaningful declines, good news for the economy, and a nice turn for the markets .\nTHREE TIMES BIDEN FORGAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING\nThe S&P 500 is now up more than 5% in just the past month alone and rose 25% since the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has bounced 6.5% in the past month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up a whopping 45.5% from the start of 2023.\nQuincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said that the most recent consumer price index report, which showed inflation running at a cooler 3.1% pace, helped underpin and confirm that prices were coming down at a faster clip. That is hopeful for investors eager for rate cuts.\n“Not at the point that the Fed could declare victory, but that it is moving in the right direction,” she told the .\nKrosby explained that this latest rally in the markets is better news because it’s more broad-based. She pointed out that it isn’t just a handful of major companies leading the indices higher, but rather small- and mid-cap stocks have also climbed. Notably, the Russell 2000 has popped nearly 15% in the past month alone.\n“The Russell 2000 is a barometer for economic conditions at the most granular level,” she said. “It sends a positive signal.”\nKrosby said that U.S. markets should end up having a decent year. That is because, historically speaking, when there is a strong year for the stock market, as 2023 was, the following year tends to end as a positive one.\n“When all is said and done, the market seems to focus on what the Fed is going to do and the expectations are that the Fed will deliver rate cuts,” Krosby said. “It may not be as early as the market suggests … but at some point, the market expects that there will be rate cuts.”\nA recent report from John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, predicts that the S&P 500 will end up being around the level it is at now when 2024 comes to a close.\n“Fortunately, corporate profits are set to gain traction as we expect market growth to reflect earnings gains. Our base case scenario has the S&P Index fairly valued in the 4,750 range by year-end 2024,” a summary of the report said.\nRodney Lake, vice dean for undergraduate programs at George Washington University and director of the university’s Investment Institute, told the that the perception of these coming rate cuts bodes well for the stock market. He expressed optimism for the year ahead.\n“Many people are expecting that rate cuts are coming, that very likely will continue to lift stocks higher and for our outlook at the GWU Investment Institute, is that the market will move higher in 2024 on a total return basis,” Lake said.\nLake said there are also uncertainties surrounding the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip. If those become broader conflicts involving more actors, it would have the potential to weigh on the equity market, Lake said.\nBut Lake said that outside of the wars broadening, the most significant obstacle for the stock market next year might be if declining inflation suddenly reverses course and begins to move higher. That could cause the Fed to not cut rates and could cause investors to become spooked.\n“In the worst-case scenario, that would get so bad that the market would have to start pricing in higher for longer and potentially an increase,” Lake said. “I think the probability of that is quite low at this point given where inflation has been trending … but I would say that inflation turning around and being higher than expected is probably the most significant thing that could derail a positive outlook for 2024.”\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThomas Mathews, a finance professor at Florida Gulf Coast University, told the that he sees four main drivers for stock performance this coming year: the overall economic performance of the U.S., the Fed’s monetary policy, price momentum, and the U.S. presidential election.\nMathews said he expects single-digit gains for the stock market next year and, at worst, says the market would only end up down by a percentage point or two.\nLatest Ferrari: More terrible than joyful By: Jack Baruth The cultural story of denazification By: Anthony Paletta Stick a spork in 2023 By: Rob Long Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

    "text": "Friday, June 21st 2024, 5:35 am The Tulsa Dream Center and the Red Cross are partnering to help prevent drownings this summer. The Dream Center said thanks to the curriculum, resources, and equipment provided by the Red Cross, adults and children will learn how to swim for free. The Red Cross said its Aquatics Centennial Campaign has been instrumental in reducing accidental drownings by promoting water-safe communities. The Dream Center said it opened a pool more than a year ago with the goal of teaching children in North Tulsa how to swim. The initiative was prompted by the death of two siblings. Executive Director Tim Newton said so far, 1,500 boys and girls have learned how to swim and they have also certified 40 lifeguards. “They learn everything from how to maneuver in water, in situations that may be play, but also in situations that may not be when just you fall into the water. What does that feel like? What is it like? Jumping into water with your regular clothes and being able to get out of the pool and being able to navigate the water during that time,\" Newton explained. The Dream Center said it has open spots for its four week long session in July and there are classes for the entire family. June 21st, 2024 June 21st, 2024 June 21st, 2024 June 21st, 2024",

The company highlights operating earnings of $20.0 million, translating to $0.22 per share.\nThe company observed a positive shift in key financial metrics despite external economic challenges. Notably, total assets decreased to $11.5 billion, with loans and leases dropping to $9.6 billion. Meanwhile, total deposits rose by $9.8 million, reaching $8.9 billion, primarily fueled by an increase in customer deposits by $113.8 million, countered by a $104.0 million decline in brokered deposits.\nBrookline Bancorp also reported an improvement in its net interest margin, climbing 10 basis points to 3.22% for Q1 2025, signaling lower funding costs. The nonperforming loans ratio decreased to 0.65%, showcasing enhanced asset quality. Despite a decline in non-interest income to $5.7 million, primarily due to reduced derivative revenue, Brookline Bancorp's effective tax rate fell to 25.0% from 26.4%, aiding overall profitability.\nThe company is strategically reducing its commercial real estate exposure in favor of bolstering its presence in the commercial and industrial (C&I) markets.

    "title": "Techno-Fascism: Elon Musk, Transhumanism And The Rise Of Tyranny",
    "text": "In this video, we discuss the rise of fascism and transhumanism in light of Elon Musk’s attempt to influence the politics of Germany and England:\nIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19:24)\nChrist was not against wealth, but really was speaking of the elite of society. And for good reason. Anytime an evil ideology takes hold of society, you can rest assured that financing its spread is an elite circle. We see the same thing with the industry of science and technology.\n“Scientists and technologists had acquired the reputation of being magicians who had access to a special source of information and wisdom out of reach of mankind.” — Herbert York, American nuclear physicist who was very close to Eisenhower.\nWhen one looks to the rise of the Third Reich, you will find that behind the rise of this frankenstein were the industrialists and financial establishments. Today, we see a very similar phenomena of industrialists supporting the rise of today’s nazism, which is the transhumanist idea that mankind must evolve by merging with Artificial Intelligence, and that if he refuses to do so, he will be inferior to a new race of cyborgs that will surpass man in the process of evolution. If the Nazis of the past aspired to be ubermensch or supermen, the nazis of today want to evolve into cyborgs. Here, we demonstrate how we are digressing to what the Book of Wisdom warned us about:\nLet us oppress the righteous poor man;\nlet us not spare the widow\nor regard the gray hairs of the aged.\nBut let our might be our law of right,\nfor what is weak proves itself to be useless. (Wisdom 2:10-11)\nAll of this evil always starts off by elevating a type of a ubermensch (superman). In our own time, we have the transhumanist fantasy about the cyborg. Elon Musk holds to the transhumanist vision of merging man and machine. Speaking at the Tesla launch in Dubai, Musk stated :\n“Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence … “It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.”\nMusk believes that if humans can colonize Mars, that this will lead to the next step in human evolution. In a 2015 video Musk explained:\n“What are the important steps in the evolution of life? Obviously there was the advent of single celled life, there was differentiation to plants and animals, there was life going from oceans to land, there was mammals, consciousness, and I would argue also on that scale, should fit life becoming multi-planetary.”\nMusk sees space travel and the merging of man and machine as the next step of human evolution. Hence why he believes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to be superior to humans to the point that we will be as apes in the site of machine intelligence. In order to ‘evolve,’ insists Musk, humans need to have injected in their heads computer chips made by his company, Neuralink . By having this chip implanted into our heads, humans can escape their impending state of inferiority:\n“I think generally people underestimate the capability of AI — they sort of think it’s a smart human … But it’s going to be much more than that. It will be much smarter than the smartest human. …Can a chimpanzee really understand humans? Not really … We just seem like strange aliens. They mostly just care about other chimpanzees. And this will be how it is, more or less. … If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em — that’s what Neuralink is about. Can we go along for the ride with AI?”\nPreaching science fiction to bedazzle the airheads of atheism, Musk then markets his company and pushes for his ideology of transhumanism, or the ideology that in order for human evolution to continue, mankind must ‘evolve’ by becoming a cyborg or partially machine himself. Those who do not merge with machine will then be like apes, at least in the twisted perspective of technocrats like Musk. So, those who do not conform, will be seen as inferior apes, much like how the Nazis and the rest of the scientific racists of the 20th century saw their enemies as being lower in the scale of human evolution, or as being closer to primate than human (or supermen). We know that these scientists are never going to create their ‘evolved’ humans. This is not the concern at hand. The concern is that if these agents of darkness ever get full power, what depths of destruction are they willing to bring in the name of ushering in their fantasy into reality? The rebels of 18th France wanted complete equality in society — this was their fantasy that never came to existence — and they were willing to butcher hundreds of thousands to fulfill their fantasy. The Nazis had dreams of becoming supermen, and their only result was countless dead and the world brought low to an abyss. Transhumanism is truly the eugenics of the 21st century, and we are seeing its ideology entrenching the soul of current generations, drunk off of a dangerous fantasy.\n“… In holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” — Dwight D. Eisenhower, Farewell Address.\nWhen Herbert York, the director of the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon, heard these words of Eisenhower, he felt a sense of consternation. In the mid-1960s, York visited Eisenhower at his winter home in the California desert and asked him what he meant by what he said. “I asked him to explain more fully what he meant by the warnings, but he declined to do so,” recounted York. “I pressed this line of questions further by asking him whether he had any particular people in mind when he warned us about the ‘the danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.’” Eisenhower replied: “(Werhner) von Braun and (Edward) Teller [father of the hydrogen bomb].” (See Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip , ch. 20, pp. 378-379)\nWehrner von Braun was an SS scientist who had slaves working to help build his giant V-2 rocket, and yet von Braun ended up in the United State working in NASA’s space program. None of this is surprising, given the fact that it was the United States’s eugenic programs that inspired the Nazis’ own eugenic policies. Thus, von Braun getting employed by the US was merely the teacher hiring the student; it was symptomatic of the convergence between eugenics and industrial elitism. This was not only seen after the Second World War, but before, when the United States’s industrial and financial players backed the rise of the Third Reich. Today, we see the technological elite supporting transhumanist eugenics, so it was in the past when America’s industrial and financial establishments supported the eugenic regime of the Nazis. A statement that really reveals this was from William Dodd, the US Ambassador to Germany, when he wrote to President Roosevelt in 1936 (three years after Hitler came to power) about how the Germans were being backed by over a hundred different American corporations, including DuPont, Standard Oil, and American IG:\n“Much as I believe in peace as our best policy, I cannot avoid the fears which Wilson emphasized more than once in conversations with me, August 15, 1915 and later: the breakdown of democracy in all Europe will be a disaster to the people. But what can you do? At the present moment more than a hundred American corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings. The DuPonts have three allies in Germany that are aiding in the armament business. Their chief ally is the I.G. Farben Company, a part of the Government which gives 200,000 marks a year to one propaganda organization operating on American opinion. Standard Oil Company (New York sub-company) sent $2,000,000 here in December 1933 and has made $500,000 a year helping Germans make Ersatz gas for war purposes; but Standard Oil cannot take any of its earnings out of the country except in goods. They do little of this, report their earnings at home, but do not explain the facts. The International Harvester Company president told me their business here rose 33% a year (arms manufacture, I believe), but they could take nothing out. Even our airplanes people have secret arrangement with Krupps. General Motor Company and Ford do enormous businesses here through their subsidiaries and take no profits out. I mention these facts because they complicate things and add to war dangers.”\nHere we can see how multiple companies were putting in tremendous amounts of finance into Germany’s military industry. Dodd put into his diary on how he met with an American attorney in Germany and asked him regarding the Standard Oil Company in New York sending a million dollars to Germany to help them make synthetic gasoline from coal for military use:\n“These men were hardly out of the building before the lawyer came in again to report his difficulties. I could not do anything. I asked him, however: Why did the Standard Oil Company of New York send $1,000,000 here in December, 1933, to aid the Germans in making gasoline from soft coal for war emergencies? Why do the International Harvester people continue to manufacture in Germany when their company gets nothing out of the country and when it has failed to collect its war loses? He saw my point and agreed that it looked foolish and that it only means greater losses if another war breaks loose.”\nMuch of American history can be summed up as the Americans creating monsters only to later slay them. The creation of the Nazi monster was greatly due to finance from Wall Street in the 1920s and aid from big American industry. For example, the Reich’s military was reliant on synthetic oil, but how did it learn to produce this? It was thanks to Standard Oil giving IG Farben (one of the major industries in Germany) their hydrogenation patents and technology. It was thanks to these patents and technologies that Germany went from producing less than 300,000 tons of synthetic gasoline in 1934 to producing 6 1/2 million tons, 85% of which (5 1/2 million tons) was synthetic oil using the the Standard Oil hydrogenation process. The Kilgore Committee reported on how Germans were sent to Detroit to learn about this process and how how IG Farben sent scientists to the US to learn American arial technology:\n“Germans were brought to Detroit to learn the techniques of specialized production of components, and of straight-line assembly. What they saw caused further reorganization and refitting of other key German war plants. The techniques learned in Detroit were eventually used to construct the dive-bombing Stukas. … At a later period I.G. Farben representatives in this country enabled a stream of German engineers to visit not only plane plants but others of military importance, in which they learned a great deal that was eventually used against the United States.”\nThe same Kilgore Committee stated that the “United States accidentally played an important role in the technical arming of Germany.” But the truth is that this was no accident, and the American industrialists knew that they were helping Nazis in their war efforts. In the words of historian Gabriel Kolko:\n“The business press [in the United States] was aware, from 1935 on, that German prosperity was based on war preparations. More important, it was conscious of the fact that German industry was under the control of the Nazis and was being directed to serve German rearmament, and the first mentioned most frequently in this context was the giant chemical empire, I.G. Farben.”\nThe financing of Germany, which is what boosted the country to reindustrialization, came from the US due to the Dawes Plan and later the Young Plan, both US government programs to financially aid Germany after the First World War. The Treaty of Versailles, which was the result of Germany’s defeat in World War One, put a financial burden on the country. International bankers saw this as an opportunity to float profitable loans for German industrial cartels in the United States. Both Plans were contrived by these same central bankers. In 1924 the Allies chose a committee of bankers led by American banker Charles G. Dawes, to develop the plan (hence the name). These bankers would become the Committee of Experts, and It was their American funding that would eventually bankroll industries that were essential to Nazi Germany, IG Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke, in the mid-1920s.These bankers acted as both creditors and statesmen. When they worked as creditors they were giving away loans with the hopes of making profit; when they donned their statesmen hats, they were working to “solve” the “problem” of reparations. As Georgetown University Professor of International Relations Carroll Quigley put it:\n“It is worthy of note that this system was set up by the international bankers and that the subsequent lending of other people’s money to Germany was very profitable to these bankers.”\nIn 1929, Owen Young became the chairman of the Committee of Experts, which consisted of J.P. Morgan himself, alongside TW Lamont, a Morgan partner, and TN Perkins, a banker with Morgan associates. There were also German members of the Committee of Experts. There was Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, who would eventually finance the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), better known as the Nazi Party. So, a Nazi was involved in these delegations, representing German interests. The Plans to give loans to Germany was done, supposedly, to maintain peace. But they had the opposite effect. In the words of James Martin: “These loans for reconstruction became a vehicle for arrangements that did more to promote World War II than to establish peace after World War I.”\nIf you look at the details of the loans, you will see how three major corporations that would be the industrial backbone for the Third Reich were bankrolled by three Wall Street syndicates. Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft (AEG) or German General Electric, got $35 million from National City Co . AEG was amongst the corporate powerhouses that backed the Nazis. National City Co. also gave $30 million to American IG Chemical , or the American Branch for IG Farben which would be the most notorious industry for the Third Reich. Dillon, Read & Co. gave $70,255,000 to Vereinigte Stahlwerke , or United Steelworks, which would also go on to support the Nazis. Both IG Farben and Vereinigte Stahwerke would become the dominating industries in the chemical and steel markets under the Third Reich for the German military, especially for things like explosives and synthetic gasoline. Between 1937 and 1938, 95% of Germany’s explosives were produced by these two companies. It was thanks to Standard Oil’s cooperation with IG Farben that led the latter to having a monopoly on Germany’s synthetic gas production. In the words of Anthony Sutton:\n“In brief, in synthetic gasoline and explosives (two of the very basic elements of modern warfare), the control of German World II output was in the hands of two German combines created by Wall Street loans under the Dawes Plan.”\nThere was also a lot of help from American industry for Nazi Germany. For example, the two biggest tank producers in Nazi Germany were Opel , a subsidiary of General Motors, and Ford AG, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company of Detroit. In fact, the Nazis gave tax exempt status to Opel in 1936, in order to enable General Motors to expand its production plants in Germany. It is no wonder that Henry Ford was decorated by the Nazis for his services to the Reich. (See Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler , ch. 1) The funding of the Nazi Party when it was still new also had connections to American finance. When Fritz Thyssen, the German steel magnate who was very close to the Nazis, was interrogated in 1945, he recounted how he was approached in 1923 by General Erich Ludendorff at the time when French troops were evacuating the Ruhr. Not too long after this meeting, Thyssen was introduced to Adolf Hitler and then financed the Nazi Party through Ludendorff. Thyssen then arranged a loan of 250,000 marks for the Nazis at the Bank Voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV in Rotterdam.\nIts not surprising as to why Thyssen would choose this particular bank, since it was a subsidiary of the August Thyssen Bank of Germany, which was ran by his grandfather, Friedrich Thyssen, and also led by his father, August Thyssen (after whom the bank was named). This was Thyssen’s personal banking operation and it was connected with the WA Harriman financial interests in New York. E. Roland Harriman was the director of the Union Banking Corporation in New York City, which was controlled by the Dutch Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV, the very subsidiary of the August Thyssen Bank through which Fritz Thyssen funded Hitler. Roland Harriman’s fellow director at the Union Banking Corporation in New York was Nazi financier Hendrick Jozef Kouwenhoven, who in the 1930s would become a director of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, the very company that would be an industrial powerhouse for the Third Reich and which was founded thanks to Wall Street funds in the 1920s. (See Sutton, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler , ch. 7, pp. 103-107).\nSo in this history we see the financial establishment and the technological establishment being the backbone for a eugenic regime. Today, we are seeing the cultivation of a new eugenic ideology of transhumanism, and just like in the past, it is the industrialists like Elon Musk who is advancing it. The same elites who backed the Nazis, are the same types of personalities we see supporting the new eugenics of today — people like Musk, Peter Thiel , etc., — and so here we are, descending down the same spiral towards chaos.",

    "title": "Some Muslim American advocates hesitant to work with White House on Islamophobia",
    "text": "Some Muslim American advocates hesitant to work with White House on Islamophobia The White House's push to create a strategy to counter Islamophobia is facing reluctance amid a spike in hate-fueled incidents against Arab and Muslim Americans since [Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-military-khan-younis-yahya-sinwar-architect-october-7-hamas-attack/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17). CBS News spoke with several Muslim and Arab American advocates who voiced frustration with the [Biden administration's response to the situation in Gaza](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2024-michigan-arab-american-anger-israel-hamas-war-gaza-biden-votes/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17), citing the increasing number of civilians that have been killed and President Biden stopping short of calling for a cease-fire. Muslim American advocate Salam Al-Marayati has worked with the Biden White House in the past. But despite the Biden administration's efforts to craft a strategy to counter Islamophobia in the U.S., he's skeptical about working with them in the future. \"At this moment in time, it is very hard to even imagine how a national strategy to counter Islamophobia will work, Al-Marayati, the president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which is also a member of the American Muslim Community Coalition, told CBS News. \"American Muslims here in the United States feel unsafe and unsupported as they witness the horrific attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Muslim families, students, and employees are afraid to speak out for fear of retribution as many who have spoken out have faced retaliatory action including loss of employment, suspension, censorship, trolling, bullying, and targeted violence.\" The White House announced on Nov. 1 plans to develop a national strategy to counter Islamophobia, led by the Domestic Policy and National Security Councils. The proposal follows an announcement in May marking the federal government's first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. Conversations and meetings on the development of the Islamophobia strategy date back a year, according to a senior administration official who said engagement with stakeholders in the community is ongoing with additional meetings scheduled for early next year. The effort is part of a White House interagency policy committee created in Dec. 2022 that focuses on countering [antisemitism, Islamophobia](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antisemitic-anti-muslim-incidents-israel-hamas-war-anti-defamation-league/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) and related types of discrimination. \"[The development of the strategy] should be really welcome news. I think the challenge is given what's going on and especially with the death toll and destruction rising and rising, people are understandably very hurt, angry, shocked [and] frustrated at America's involvement in this,\" said another source close to the discussions surrounding the development of the strategy. \"And so the timing of these two different things overlapping even though they are totally separate is really challenging. And unfortunately I don't know what will happen with the islamophobia strategy as a result.\" While some have expressed doubts, others say it is important to continue work on ways to counter hate and solve systemic discrimination problems that have targeted the Arab and Muslim communities for decades. \"We recognize, as do most other communities, that engaging on one issue doesn't mean that you are endorsing or accepting the White House's policies on that issue or any other issue,\" said Arsalan Suleman, who is board chair and co-founder of America Indivisible, a nonprofit dedicated to combating Islamophobia. \"So while I and many other community members have very strong criticisms of the current policy on Gaza, we certainly want to engage with the White House on the Islamophobia strategy, given its importance,\" Suleman added. Advocates say a plan to counter Islamophobia in the U.S. is necessary after a [spike](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antisemitic-anti-muslim-incidents-israel-hamas-war-anti-defamation-league/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) in anti-Muslim sentiment following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel. But some question how effective the strategy could be and hesitate to take part in its development. A White House official told CBS News that administration officials are \"listening\" to the community and that the Biden administration remains committed to the development of a strategy. \"We've had engagements where community members have engaged on the strategy and have also been able to make their points clear about their positions on what's happening overseas in the course of those engagements while they've been focused primarily on the strategy,\" a senior administration official said. CBS News spoke to the staffer on background to talk candidly about the ongoing development of the strategy. \"We want to make sure that we are listening [and] so as a part of their communication with us, when they raise those issues, of course, we're listening to them. And many have made the point that what's happening overseas has an impact on what's happening in the United States in terms of Islamophobia,\" the official said. The official insisted that support within the Arab and Muslim American community is strong, citing a letter from the American Muslim Community Coalition applauding the early November announcement. \"We commit to participating actively in the process of supporting the development of the strategy, and look forward to a comprehensive approach that addresses the various drivers of Islamophobia, including deep-rooted institutional manifestations that have plagued our communities for decades,\" the letter reads. The White House hopes to complete its work on the strategy in late winter or spring. The senior administration official also responded to criticism about the timing of the announcement explaining that the White House had planned to announce the development of the strategy well before the Hamas attack in October. Months of conversations and meetings with dozens of Muslim and Arab American groups pre-dated the attack, the official said. An increase in hate-fueled anti-Muslim incidents in the United States — including the [deadly](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antisemitic-anti-muslim-incidents-israel-hamas-war-anti-defamation-league/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in the Chicago area — created a need to move forward with announcing the strategy, the official added.

    "title": "‘Returning to scene of the crime’: UK media at it again as in-form Carey aims to silence Lord’s members",
    "text": "Anyone can contribute to The Roar and have their work featured alongside some of Australia’s most prominent sports journalists. Alex Carey is sure to be the pantomime villain on Australia’s return to Lord’s for the first time since the infamous 2023 Ashes Test ‘cheating’ bust-up — but captain Mitch Marsh smiles his in-form batter is just rapt to be back at the home of cricket. Marsh is adamant his side have “moved on” following the unprecedented scenes of last June when Carey became England’s public enemy number one for his controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow, leading to bad blood on the field and howling fury off it among the spluttering Long Room grandees . Not that Carey is in the slightest bit worried as he heads to the potentially decisive fourth one-day international, having, with seemingly perfect timing, rediscovered the batting form which could make MCC members choke on their lunch again on Friday. With local media happily suggesting Carey is “returning to the scene of the crime”, the wicketkeeper’s superb innings of 77no at Headingley and 74 at Chester-le-Street in the last two ODIs have made him even more of an important target in English eyes. His form may have deteriorated amid the furore over the final three Tests last year, but the 33-year-old has been flying since being reintroduced to the white-ball side behind the stumps, taking advantage of his chance after Josh Inglis suffered a quad niggle. Asked if he felt Carey had been on a revenge mission after his trials and tribulations last summer, Marsh said: “I don’t think that’s in his character, but Alex loves playing England, we all do. I think he’s just rapt to be back here playing for Australia. “He’s been fantastic since he came back in, both innings that he’s played have been outstanding knocks for the team. “He’s a great character to have around our team and very excited to be back in.” The captain was inevitably reminded of last year’s shenanigans at Lord’s, but brushed it all aside in his usual laid-back manner. Asked if there had been much talk about the 2023 hoo-ha, he shrugged: “No there hasn’t, we’ve really moved on from that, I think. “There’s always excitement playing at Lord’s. It’s the greatest ground in the world – bar the WACA of course – and the history and tradition here, it’s always a fantastic place to play. “Yes it was (incredible scenes). Obviously these things happen in Ashes Tests, there’s not a series goes by that doesn’t have some sort of drama, but we’re just rapt to be here.” Marsh said he was happy that, for the first time on this injury and illness-hit white-ball tour, he’ll have a fully fit squad at his disposal, with Adam Zampa and Travis Head’s return “massive” after England won the third of the five-match series in their absence at Chester-le-Street to narrow the deficit to 2-1 Inglis is also fit to return after an impressive start to the tour with Marsh not ruling out the prospect that both he and Carey could play as Australia seek to seal the series in front of a full-house before Sunday’s final match in Bristol. Once again, though, there are fears rain could interfere. It poured down at Lord’s on Thursday to deny both teams the chance to practice outdoors, and showers are also forecast in the morning and early afternoon on match day. © AAP",

    "text": "Las lluvias caídas la tarde de este jueves en el territorio nacional provocaron inundaciones en vías y sectores del Gran Santo Domingo, afectando a varias viviendas y el tránsito vehicular.\nEntre estas localidades afectadas se encuentran Villa Faro, Los Mina y Alma Rosa, todos pertenecientes al municipio Santo Domingo Este. Mientras que las calles y avenidas fueron la Charles de Gaulle, Ecológica, Osvaldo Bazil, entre otras.\nSegún expresaron comunitarios, el problema del desbordamiento es de décadas, sien embargo, las autoridades no han mostrado interés en resolverlo.\n«Esto tiene todo una vida. El agua llega hasta la avenida», sostuvo una residente del sector Los Minas.\nAsimismo, agregaron que el mismo se debe en gran parte al bloqueo de la basura en el sistema de alcantarillado.\n«El problema es que desde El Invi de la Carretera Mella, vine agua para acá… Nosotros le hemos solicitado a las autoridades actuales, desde el 2022, que nos resuelvan el problema de los filtrantes», añadió otro lugareño de la barriada.\nInforme del tiempo\nDe su lado, la Oficina Nacional de Meteorología (\nOnamet) dijo que este viernes ocurrirán lluvias moderadas a fuertes con tormentas eléctricas y ráfagas de vientos sobre las provincias Puerto Plata, Espaillat, María Trinidad Sánchez, San Pedro de Macorís, La Romana, San Cristóbal, Monseñor Nouel, San José de Ocoa, La Vega, Santiago, Sánchez Ramírez, Gran Santo Domingo y el Distrito Nacional.\nEl organismo explicó que esas condiciones serán provocadas por la incidencia de un sistema frontal sobre el territorio nacional.\nMientras que el Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE) emitió alerta amarilla para Santo Domingo y el Distrito Nacional y verde para Santiago, La Vega y Monseñor Nouel.\nSeguir leyendo:\nCAASD: sequía estacional reduce producción de agua potable",
