From 2019 to 2024: The first 2 years of Master Thich Minh Tue's practice at the temple and in seclusion in the cave. For 4 years, I have been walking along the national highway from the North to the South, and vice versa from the South to the North. He traveled on foot through all provinces and cities in Vietnam. Food & Eating: During the trip: only accept vegetarian food once a day and eat before noon. His clothes were made of patchwork fabric. Master Sleep sits next to him under the corner of a tree or sleeps in the cemetery and only sleeps sitting, not sleeping lying down. By this year, this monk became widely known through Youtube and tickok channels. And there are also many people who have shaved their hair like Master Minh Tue and have followed him as an 'escort'. Local people welcomed them on both sides of the road in large numbers, obstructing traffic and causing the traffic police to get involved. What will the Master's upcoming journey be like?",

    "text": "Marin County sees evacuation orders lifted in some areas In Marin County, evacuation orders have been canceled for areas around Stinson Beach. Earlier Thursday, some communities near the beach were told to be ready to go due to high surf and storm surge.\nSANTA CRUZ, Calif. - The Bay Area&apos;s beach towns got hammered on Thursday as high surf and storm surges ravaged the coastline.\nAround Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar State Beach in Santa Cruz, logs littered the sandy coast and onlookers sat on perches witnessing Mother Nature in action.\nIn addition, West Cliff in Santa Cruz was also closed between Columbia and David Way. The iconic road is still being repaired from last year&apos;s storms.\nMeanwhile, in Pacifica, a pair of crab fishers arrived at Linda Mar Beach and then turned around to go home.\n\"Apparently, that&apos;s not going to happen,\" Paul Gonzales said. \"But the pier&apos;s closed. These waves are outrageous.\"\nSteve Ramirez sighed and said: \"We&apos;re just going to pack up.\"\nHigh surf warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast as waves are expected to break up to 40 feet high. As of Thursday afternoon, reports from the Bay Area&apos;s coastal buoys were showing waves just under 30 feet off both the Sonoma County coast and Monterey Bay.\nHuge low-pressure systems in the Pacific Ocean are pushing large groups of waves toward the California coast.\nThe National Weather Service reported that its buoy off Bodega Bay recorded waves up to 28 feet on Thursday morning, closing in on the previous record of 31 feet seen during January storms at the beginning of the year.\nEvacuation warnings lifted after high surf and flooding shut down Santa Cruz, coastal areas Around Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar Beach, the waves crashed over walls, flooding streets, and depositing massive trees and driftwood ashore.\n\"The trees act like battering rams against the houses and the garage doors that are along the street here,\" says resident, Steve Benedetti.\nResidents in Santa Cruz County know the danger all too well. So do the authorities. But they worried about the tourists.\n\"We do have visitors from out of town that may not have been expecting this kind of tidal surge during their visit. So we did have deputies out here very early going door to door explaining to people hey this is coming,\" says Ashley Keehn, public information officer with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&apos;s Office.\nEarly in the morning, the Stinson Beach Fire Department issued an evacuation order for several neighborhoods because of high surf as the winds and waves were enormous, telling people they could find a temporary safe harbor at the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nThe order was issued just before 10 a.m., and people were sent to the Stinson Beach Community Center for refuge. Residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera, Embarcadero, and sections of Calle Del Arroyo weren’t told to return to their homes until early in the afternoon.\nDrone pilot David Golubev shot video of the swell hitting the beach around 11 a.m. and getting dangerously close to houses and buildings along the shoreline.\n\"Definitely the highest tide I’ve seen so far. You could see it on the beach. It came up all the way to the top,\" Golubev said. \"I saw it was high tide, and I heard the water so I came out to see how far the water came up.\"\nOfficials said the waves reached 10 feet, more than the National Weather Service predicted.\nThe evacuation order was lifted in the early afternoon when the tide receded.\nStinson Beach Fire Chief Jesse Peri said crews are still assessing the damage in the area and at last count Thursday afternoon one person has minor injuries and a handful of homes suffered minor structural damage.\n\"The community is really resilient, so they came together to help sandbag and help each other out,\" said Peri, who reiterated that people should continue to stay away from the water.\nFurther south in San Francisco, strong swells crashed against San Francisco&apos;s Fort Point.\nImage 1 of 10 ▼ Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded in Santa Cruz on Dec. 28, 2023.

Plus de mille soldats ukrainiens avec une dizaine de chars et une vingtaine de blindés ont pénétré mardi dans cette région, selon l'état-major russe, qui a dit tout faire pour les repousser de l'autre côté de la frontière.Ce contingent semble toutefois avoir gagné du terrain en s'emparant de plusieurs kilomètres carrés en prenant les forces russes au dépourvu, bien que Kiev ait gardé un silence quasi total sur l'opération. \"La Russie a apporté la guerre à notre pays et devrait en ressentir\" les effets, a lancé Volodymyr Zelensky dans son allocution du soir, sans pour autant mentionner directement cette incursion.Today, I held an extended meeting with our foreign affairs team regarding our interaction with NATO – both with the Alliance as a whole and specifically with our neighboring NATO member countries.It is evident that together we can add more security and stability to our region… pic.twitter.com\\/M27X2S019m— Volodymyr Zelenskyy \\/ Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) August 8, 2024Dans un message publié sur X, son conseiller Mykhaïlo Podoliak a, lui aussi, affirmé que cette offensive surprise était une conséquence de \"l'agression\" russe en Ukraine, sans pour autant l'attribuer clairement aux forces de Kiev. \"Désormais, une grande partie de la communauté internationale considère la Russie comme une cible légitime pour les opérations de n'importe quel type et avec n'importe quelle arme\", a-t-il ajouté, alors que de nombreux pays occidentaux ont interdit à l'Ukraine d'utiliser les armes qu'ils lui fournissent pour frapper le territoire russe.

This includes attempts to seize foreign…— Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M) August 8, 2024Les Etats-Unis, principal soutien de Kiev, ont répété jeudi \"soutenir fermement les efforts de l'Ukraine pour se défendre contre l'agression russe\", sans commenter les détails de la situation.

    "text": "Fresh attempt to rejuvenate Naini Lake: MCD invites bids to beautify Model Town attraction Under the project, MCD will lay pipelines to ferry wastewater from the Coronation Pillar wastewater treatment plant to Model Town. Additionally, the project will also help provide irrigation water for parks in the vicinity New Delhi In a renewed push to rejuvenate the Naini Lake located in Model Town, north Delhi, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) invited bids to execute the ₹10.7-crore lake redevelopment project, senior municipal officials said on Thursday. This is the third attempt to rejuvenate the lake. Under the project, MCD will lay pipelines to ferry wastewater from the Coronation Pillar wastewater treatment plant to Model Town. Additionally, the project will also help provide irrigation water for parks in the vicinity and reduce groundwater dependence, officials said. A senior MCD official said a notice inviting tenders for the project was reissued on June 19 and the technical bids were opened on Thursday. “The project involves laying down pipelines and associated arrangement of carrying treated water from STP, Coronation Pillar, Mukherjee Nagar to Naini Lake by developing pump house and sump wells. This component along is likely to cost around ₹5.46 crore,” the official said. The lake is located amid Model Town, across 6.5 acres, and is a popular spot for leisurely strolls and family outings. MCD’s two previous attempts to rejuvenate the lake failed due to technical and procedural issues. Officials said another ₹71 lakh will be spent on subsequent arrangements to provide irrigation water from the lake to nearby parks. The project is being funded by the Central government’s Amrit Sarovar Mission. On June 12, HT reported that more than a third of 21 waterbodies taken up by the civic body under this project remained stuck and work at several sites was yet to be launched. On June 22, MCD announced that it will rejuvenate 21 ponds and waterbodies across the city under the first phase of the Amrit Sarovar Mission. The rejuvenation and beautification work of these waterbodies was to be completed by March 31, 2023, and Naini Lake was one of nine sites where the project was pending. A second senior MCD official said the lake is currently fed by groundwater drawn from borewells. “Ideally, a lake should be recharging the groundwater levels. In case of Naini Lake, we operate pumps to feed the lake. The use of treated wastewater will help the entire region,” the official said. Musical fountain and beautification The civic body will also undertake beautification of the lake area by adding 7,000 new species of plants, new walkways, designer boundary walls, benches and basic infrastructure, such as a peripheral stormwater drain, officials said. According to the fresh bids, the project work includes the construction of a boundary wall, renovation of the toilet block and addition of benches. “We will be strengthening the existing peripheral stormwater drain along the lake by providing RCC drain. Around ₹26 lakh will be spent on provision of lighting arrangement in the lake and horticulture work,” the second official said. The civic body will also develop two floating fountains in the lake at a cost of ₹39 lakh component. “The private company executing the work will also be undertaking operation and maintenance of the lake,” the official said.
