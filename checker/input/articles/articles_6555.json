    "text": "El mercado está confiando cada vez más en la estrategia de inteligencia artificial (IA) de Alphabet, la matriz de Google, lo que está llevando su valoración nuevamente a los US$ 2 billones. En lo que va del 2024, las acciones de la compañía se revalorizaron un 15%, y en el último año, la tendencia acumula un crecimiento de más del 50%. En consecuencia, actualmente, la capitalización bursátil de Alphabet ya es de US$ 1,99 billones. \"El papel de Google en los productos de IA generativa presentará enormes oportunidades de crecimiento para las acciones\", comentó Sylvia Jablonski, directora ejecutiva en Defiance ETFs. De acuerdo a la especialista, la empresa también se beneficiará de la creación de sus propias herramientas de IA generativa que podrían impulsar anuncios más precisos y aumentar los ingresos de su división publicitaria. Esta semana, durante una conferencia llevada a cabo en Las Vegas, Alphabet mostró cómo se puede utilizar Gemini, su IA, para crear anuncios, prevenir amenazas de ciberseguridad y crear videos cortos y podcasts. Además, también mostró un nuevo chip diseñado para manejar cargas de trabajo de IA. \"Los avances en hardware de Google, el progreso de Gemini y las demostraciones de aplicaciones impulsadas por IA deberían ayudar a mejorar la confianza en las capacidades de IA\", escribió Justin Post, analista en Bank of America. Consideramos que la nube es un impulsor positivo para las acciones dada la credibilidad de la IA, un crecimiento más rápido y la mejora de los márgenes, agregó. Tras la suba de las acciones, ahora cotizan a 21 veces las ganancias futuras, muy por debajo de las 33 veces de Microsoft y cerca del mismo nivel que el S&P 500.",

Davis, que adotou o nome muçulmano Abdul Wahid, que significa “o servo do Um”, juntou-se à fé depois de uma conversa de uma hora com Abdi sobre ser a melhor versão de si mesmo. Davis, 29 anos, está invicto com 29 vitórias e detém o título dos leves da Associação Mundial de Boxe desde 2019. Ele também está envolvido em projetos de desenvolvimento comunitário em sua cidade natal, como a reforma de casas em Sandtown-Winchester, o bairro de West Baltimore onde cresceu. .

    "text": "May 01, 2025\nTimes Now Digital, TN Lifestyle DeskNever joke about her weight, skin, height, or hair. Even small comments can hurt her confidence deeply. A lot of women grow up insecure about how they look which gets planted from an early change.\nCredit: Canva\nSaying things like “you’re too sensitive” can make her feel ashamed of how she feels. Let her know it’s okay to express her emotions. Not just girls but boys also go through this.\nCredit: Canva\nIf she enjoys reading, dancing, or playing games, don’t laugh at her hobbies. Encouraging her passions helps her grow. Who knows she could be the next famous dancer or singer if you keep encouraging her.\nCredit: Canva\nMaking fun of her friends may embarrass her or cause distance. Respect her choices and friendships. Friends are a big source of support, just like parents.\nCredit: Canva\nNever say her goals are silly or impossible. Even if they change later, dreams are important for building self-belief. Take Elle Woods from ‘Legally Blonde’ who was told by her family that she wasn’t meant for legal studies. In the end, she proved them all wrong.\nCredit: Canva\nAvoid teasing her about what she wears. Clothes are a way she explores identity, so support her instead.\nCredit: Canva\nDon’t tease her for slipping up. Everyone makes mistakes. It’s part of learning and growing.\nCredit: Canva\nPuberty can be confusing and sensitive. Joking about changes can cause shame and silence. Comments regarding her braces or pimples will hurt her self esteem.\nCredit: Canva\nWhether she’s loud, quiet, or has a unique way of speaking, she deserves to feel heard without mockery.\nCredit: Canva\nTeasing by saying “Why can't you be like her?” hurts. Every child is different so celebrate her for who she is.\nCredit: Canva\nThanks For Reading!",

    "text": "ABOARD the Norwegian Coast Guard Vessel Bjørnøya -- U.S., Finnish and Norwegian military officials flanked a representative from the newest NATO member, Sweden, on Friday as congratulations were shared and Russia remained top of mind. Sweden officially joined NATO on Thursday, ending centuries of neutrality, amid the largest NATO exercise since 1988. It was a clear sign to the Kremlin that its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has not gone unmet, and that Nordic countries -- along with the U.S. and other NATO allies -- are prepared to defend their own borders. U.S. [Navy](https://www.military.com/navy) Vice Adm. Doug Perry, the commander of one of NATO's three operational hubs, was in attendance aboard a Norwegian ship off the coast of Alta, Norway, where U.S. and NATO allies are holding a major exercise, Nordic Response 2024. He told reporters that Sweden's accession to the alliance was critical to deterring Russia from further destabilizing the continent, something that members of the Swedish armed forces told Military.com they agreed with.

Gen. Carl-Johan Edström, chief of joint operations for the Swedish Armed Forces, hailed Sweden's accession to NATO not as the end of an era of neutrality, but as the beginning of a new age of Swedish history. The country's entry into the alliance comes two years after it originally applied for membership on the heels of the war in Ukraine. \"Let us all remember that we are entering as a country at a time when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has thrown Europe into a very serious security situation,\" Edström said. Nordic Response involves 20,000 troops from more than 13 countries, as well as over 100 aircraft and 50 ships. Roughly 2,500 Marines are participating in the exercise as well, alongside their U.S. Navy counterparts. The exercise's parent operation, Steadfast Defender, is the largest in decades and the second largest since 1952, just a few years after NATO was founded. Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership just months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While Finland was ratified in 2023, Sweden faced holds from Hungary and Turkey until last month, when the former finally voted to accept the Nordic country into the alliance. Now, NATO has been joined by two countries with enormous military industrial bases, right near Russia. Sweden's accession into NATO also comes as the need for the alliance is being questioned by the political right in the U.S. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for the 2024 presidential election, said last month that he would encourage Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" if NATO members did not meet their payment obligations. \"Look, if they're not going to pay, we're not going to protect. OK?\" he said. Most Americans support NATO, [according to last month's Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/611261/americans-remain-committed-nato-critical.aspx), which said that two-thirds of Americans want to maintain or increase U.S. support for the alliance. Sixteen percent said it should decrease its commitment to NATO while only 12% said they think the U.S. should withdraw from the alliance completely. Breaking down those numbers, Republicans were least supportive of NATO, according to Gallup. Experts Military.com spoke to in recent interviews said that, while European nations have made \"huge strides\" in bolstering their defense spending, there is still a sense of \"nervousness\" across the continent regarding U.S. support of NATO, Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Military.com on Monday. \"At the current time, there is a sense in Europe -- given Trump's recent comments and the possibility he may return to the Oval Office -- that ... the U.S. might adjust its traditional policy to defending Europe and its commitment to the NATO alliance,\" Monaghan said. In 2019, NATO bolstered its operational capabilities in response to the growing Russian threat by establishing Joint Force Command-Norfolk, or JFC-NF, a command node that physically placed alliance planning and preparation on American soil. That decision \"has been soundly validated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago,\" according to Perry. Military.com asked Perry what he would say to Americans who question NATO's importance domestically and to overall strategic defense. He pointed to how NATO has unified North America and Europe for 75 years and noted that the only time Article V of the alliance agreement -- an attack on one member nation is an attack on all -- has been invoked was in the aftermath of 9/11 when \"NATO rallied to support the USA.\" \"NATO contributes to American homeland security on a daily basis,\" Perry said, adding that JFC-NF routinely works with other North American defense units to track threats from the Atlantic and Arctic. \"With the invasion of Ukraine, the importance of NATO's contribution to the collective defense of the Euro-Atlantic area, including the American homeland, has never been more relevant,\" he said. For the Swedish marines trolling the waters off the coast of Alta, Norway, not much had yet changed the day after their country was ratified. The Swedish military has been participating in NATO exercises for many years, and now it is official. As light flurries of snow cascaded into the bay, they showed off two docked Swedish CB90 assault vessels. Some marines sat perched behind large machine guns, and one boat ran a lap around the Norwegian coast guard vessel the NATO leaders were on. \"I think it's really good,\" Swedish Gunnery Sgt. Joakim Sjögren told Military.com of his country's recent accession to the alliance. \"We've been basically a part of NATO -- in my opinion -- for a long time and have been doing a lot of exercises with them. So, it's the next step going forward.\" When asked whether anything had changed on the ground for him since Sweden joined, he said, \"No, it's business as usual.\" Related: [NATO Conducts Its Largest Exercises Since the Cold War in Northern Norway](https://www.military.com/video/nato-conducts-its-largest-exercises-cold-war-northern-norway) [Story Continues](javascript:void(0);)",

    "text": "In a detailed report, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team has revealed a highly targeted cyber espionage campaign against the Pakistan Navy, executed by a sophisticated and likely state-sponsored threat actor. The campaign leveraged typosquatted domains, malicious email extensions, and a stealthy information-stealing malware dubbed Sync-Scheduler.\n\\nThe operation began with a PDF lure, masquerading as an internal Pakistan Navy IT memo for configuring secure email communication with Axigen Thunderbird. Embedded within the document was a malicious URL designed to mimic legitimate Pakistan Navy domains, exploiting typosquatting to trick users. The fake URL\\u2014hxxps://paknavy[.]rf[.]gd\\u2014closely resembled the official domain but led to a server hosting a malicious Thunderbird extension.\n\\nThe malicious extension, once installed, posed as a legitimate tool titled \\u201cMail Files Downloader.\\u201d BlackBerry\\u2019s analysis revealed : \\u201c The extension then displays a login form designed specifically for \\u201c@paknavy.gov.pk\\u201d email addresses, misleading the victim into believing that upon entering their credentials they will be able to access and download their emails .\\u201d\n\\n Pakistan Navy initial lure document | Image: BlackBerry\n\\nAt the heart of the operation was Sync-Scheduler , a sophisticated information-stealing malware designed to exfiltrate sensitive documents. Authored in C++ with advanced anti-analysis features, Sync-Scheduler targets specific file types, such as .docx , .pdf , and .xlsx , organizing them for exfiltration. The malware also employs robust evasion techniques, including:\n\\n \\n Dynamic Decryption: Data is decrypted only during runtime to avoid detection. \\n Persistence Mechanisms: Scheduled tasks masquerading as legitimate processes like OneDrive and WindowsUpdate \\n \\nBlackBerry researchers noted that Sync-Scheduler\\u2019s core functionality\\u2014exfiltration of documents\\u2014remained consistent with earlier versions identified in campaigns dating back to mid-2023.\n\\nWhile attribution remains inconclusive, BlackBerry identified overlaps in tactics with two prominent groups:\n\\n \\n SideWinder: Known for targeting Pakistani government entities with similar phishing and credential harvesting techniques. \\n APT Bitter: A South Asian group suspected of espionage campaigns against Pakistan and other regional targets. \\n \\nBlackBerry cautioned: \\u201cDespite these overlaps and indications for both groups, at the time of writing this we do not feel there is a strong enough body of evidence to warrant a positive attribution to either of these groups, and will therefore consider this campaign as being perpetuated by an unknown group or nexus.\\u201d\n\\nThis targeted attack on the Pakistan Navy demonstrates the persistent risks posed by state-sponsored cyber espionage campaigns. By leveraging sophisticated tools like Sync-Scheduler and deceptive techniques like typosquatting, the adversaries showcased a high degree of skill and planning.\n\\n Related Posts: \\n\\n",

    "text": "New Delhi [India], June 2 (ANI): Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal and his wife Sunita Kejriwal offered prayers at Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place in the national capital on Sunday.\nKejriwal was given interim bail by the Supreme Court to campaign for the Lok Sabha elections on May 10 and was asked to surrender to Tihar jail on June 2.\nEarlier, the Delhi Chief Minister paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at the Raj Ghat in the national capital.\nDelhi CM, his wife Sunita Kejriwal, Delhi ministers Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Raghav Chadha, Kailash Gahlot, and other AAP leaders were present at the Raj Ghat.\nIn a post on X, the Delhi CM thanked the Supreme Court for granting him interim bail in a money laundering case linked to the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam.\n\"I came out for an election campaign for 21 days on the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court . I am very grateful to the Hon'ble Supreme Court . Today I will surrender by going to Tihar,\" Kejriwal posted on X.\n\"I will leave home at 3 pm. First, I will go to Rajghat and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. From there, I will go to the Hanuman temple in Connaught Place to seek the blessings of Hanuman Ji. And from there, I will go to the party office and meet all the workers and party leaders. From there, I will again leave for Tihar,\" he added.\n\"All of you take care of yourselves. If you are happy, then your Kejriwal will also be happy in jail,\" the Delhi CM said.\nThe Delhi CM had earlier moved the Supreme Court for an extension of interim bail. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected his plea, stating that since he was given liberty to move the trial court for regular bail, the plea here is not maintainable.\nMeanwhile, Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Saturday reserved the order on the interim bail plea moved by Kejriwal, citing medical reasons in a money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy scam.\nThe court fixed June 5 for the pronouncement of the order on the plea seeking 7-day bail, while refused to pass the order today itself as requested by Kejriwal's Lawyer.\nEarlier, Arvind Kejriwal posted an emotional message on Friday and said that he is proud that he is going to jail to save the country from dictatorship.\nIn his video message, Kejriwal said, \"The 21 days are getting over; I have to surrender. I don't know how long they will keep me in jail this time. But my spirits are high. I am going to jail to save the country from dictatorship. I am proud of this. They tried to break me many times, tried to make me bow down but I didn't.\"\nKejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-cancelled Delhi excise policy 2021-22.

    "text": "Blowing Snow Advisory: Wintry Whiteout Weekend Winter’s Fury Descends on Ontario’s Far North A Blowing Snow Advisory is in effect for Fort Severn, Peawanuck and Attawapiskat with challenging conditions expected to develop starting Friday and continuing through Sunday. The advisory warns of dangerously reduced visibility, gusty winds, and accumulating snow that will make travel extremely hazardous.\nWhat to Expect: Snow, Wind, and Near-Whiteout Conditions Light snow will make its debut on Friday, accompanied by increasing northwesterly winds gusting to 60 km/h. As Friday night progresses, the weather will intensify. Wind gusts are forecasted to reach up to 80 km/h, creating areas of blowing snow and near-blizzard conditions.\nVisibility will drop to near zero at times, particularly Friday night into Saturday. Snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are expected by Sunday, adding to the wintry mix. Winds will begin to ease on Sunday, but travel difficulties may persist until conditions stabilize.\nA Look at the Stats Winds : Gusting up to 80 km/h Snowfall : 10-15 cm expected Visibility : Reduced to near zero at times Barometric Pressure : Expected to drop significantly during the storm Humidity : Likely to hover at high levels due to continuous snowfall Historic temperatures for this date remind us that January doesn’t pull punches. Wasaho’s record high for January 2 is a balmy -6.5°C, while the record low chills us to the bone at -36.2°C.",

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service.\nMichael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2.\nLaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it.\n“The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.”\nHe completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs.\nChris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring.\n“Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said.\nAs LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced.\n“Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.
