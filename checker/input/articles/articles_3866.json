    "text": "Pride Month has kicked up a hornets nest of LGBT activism and wouldn't you know it, so much of that activism is focused on children this year. On Thursday, I wrote about how parents should ditch the wildly popular kids YouTuber \"Ms. Rachel\" for her incessant pandering to the LGBT community, going so far as to invite Dylan Mulvaney to be in one of her videos. (READ: [It's Time for Parents to Ditch Ms. Rachel](https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2024/06/06/its-time-for-parents-to-ditch-ms-rachel-n2175124)) Also on Thursday, my colleague Becky Noble published an article detailing how Scholastic, a major children's book publisher, has released a \"Pride Guide,\" which gives students and teachers a glossary of radical left LGBT terminology and even makes villains out of parents who don't want LGBT-focused reading material in schools, offering resources for anyone who wants to get a hold of these books if the school district won't allow their purchase through school funds. (READ: [Textbook Publisher Puts Out 'Pride Guide' for Teachers, Will Find 'Work Around' of School District Rules](https://redstate.com/beckynoble/2024/06/06/textbook-publisher-puts-out-pride-guide-for-teachers-will-find-work-around-of-school-district-rules-n2175121)) There seems to be a prevailing thought within the LGBT activist community that children are up for grabs and that indoctrination and grooming into the LGBT lifestyle isn't just good, it's necessary. You can see this in the way LGBT activists and politicians refer to children as a community-owned object. Take, for instance, my colleague [Jennifer O'Connell's report](https://redstate.com/jenniferoo/2024/06/05/ca-sen-scott-wieners-pride-month-rant-claims-these-are-our-kids-read-the-room-buddy-n2175073) on Wednesday about California Sen. Scott Wiener's Pride Month speech where he referred to California's children as \"our kids.\" \"We are always there for these kids. These are our kids, and we need to make sure that we are lifting them up and giving them a path to success. So we are working very hard to make that happen,\" he said. \"But as we fight all the nasty people out there who are trying to harm us, and we're gonna beat them, and we're gonna win. Let's celebrate, let's have just a festive and uplifting month. I'm so excited about it. Happy Pride, everyone,\" he later added. This is the same Scott Wiener who supports policies [removing parental consent](https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2022/06/10/california-state-senator-suggests-drag-101-be-a-k-12-curriculum-requirement-n577110) in significant medical decisions for minors. The same Scott Wiener that nominated a member of the \"Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence,\" an anti-Christian LGBT group who uses sacrilegious imagery, to be honored on by the State Senate last year. That member was \"Sister Roma,\" a porn director who likes to review pornographic movies on his podcast. This is the same Scott Wiener who said [\"Drag 101\"](https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2022/06/10/california-state-senator-suggests-drag-101-be-a-k-12-curriculum-requirement-n577110) should be a K-12 curriculum requirement in schools. That's this same Scott Wiener... hey— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) [@Scott_Wiener], this you???? [https://t.co/Y3xqyKQ9CT] [pic.twitter.com/ODLyCTcvFO] [March 26, 2024] I don't want to hear about how these people simply care about the LGBT youth. At this point, anyone buying that load of garbage is either willfully ignorant or a part of the grooming scam. Too many events and outright [declarations](https://redstate.com/streiff/2021/07/09/the-san-francisco-gay-mens-chorus-celebrated-pride-month-by-boasting-that-they-are-coming-for-your-children-n408742) that they're interested in your children for anyone to logically believe that they're just talking about the kids who just so happen to be gay or trans. Using language that points to my child and says \"ours\" is the same exact thing as pointing to me and saying \"we're your mortal enemy, and we want your child.\" I can only describe the word ours as \"bold and stupid.\" Keep in mind, these activists aren't just saying things like this in a vacuum. They do it because they know that they'll have the backing of the state in various places. The goal is to work in legislation that allows for the state to step in and also the parent. More accurately, the goal is to have the state force the parents to step back and allow the LGBT activist community to also be the child's parents, usually in the form of a teacher, counselor, or authority figure. Let's get a simple out of the way first. Every [study](https://ifstudies.org/blog/less-poverty-less-prison-more-college-what-two-parents-mean-for-black-and-white-children) shows that a child is [better off ](https://aifs.gov.au/research/research-reports/family-structure-child-outcomes-and-environmental-mediators)in the care and guidance of his or her own parents. Educational outcomes, economic stability, psychological well-being, and quality of life as adults all have far higher chances of success when a stable two parent home is left to its own devices. That's two-parent home. Not two parents and a man named Rhonda. But this doesn't matter to the LGBT community because ultimately, your kids don't matter to them. They are a means to an end. The more kids they can infect the more voting power they'll have down the line and the more perversions they can indulge in today. Anyone who actively wants to bring children into talks about sex and sexuality is a pervert and groomer. There is no middle ground here. On that note, there are no \"trans kids.\" Any adult that claims a child that just mastered the ABC's somehow has the cognitive capacity to wrap their heads around complex subjects like gender fluidity and sexuality is either a useful idiot or a groomer, and both need their hard drives checked. Looking at you, Scott Wiener. Also, keep in mind, this isn't just Wiener and a small group of people. This is the LGBT activist community en masse that push this stuff. This is what they continuously work toward. They're very open about it, and they proudly display their work whenever they get the chance. Wonder why you've recently seen so much footage of drag shows where children are involved? It's because they want you to watch them do it, and they want you to get angry about it. They want you to react because they think it garners them victim points, which they can use for sympathetic media stories. Let me be very clear here. They haven't seen a reaction. They've noticed responses from parents forming groups to protect children from them. Likewise, they've seen responses from politicians and governors crafting laws to erect barriers between them and our children...but they haven't seen a real reaction. They don't want that reaction, but that's the reaction they're going to get if they keep pushing in every avenue they can toward our kids. Let me doubly clear here. I'm not saying Americans are going to go hunting for LGBT people in the street. Most gays and lesbians I know are just as horrified and disgusted with the LGBT activist community as we are. The thing is, the activist community is pushing so hard and so far that the reaction from the public will be nasty. The governorship of Glenn Youngkin is proof that Americans will uproot legacy Democrats from strongholds to protect their kids. Parents will remove entire school boards over it. For every toe they put over the line, Americans will push them back miles. These LGBT activists are high on their own supply if they think America's kids belong to anyone but their parents. The idea that somehow they have any right to claim ownership over the flesh and blood of any American proves just how hubristic the LGBT activist community has gotten. However, they need to understand that they are a hardcore minority and that their power isn't what they think it is. They might enjoy having their way in deep blue strongholds like San Francisco, but in the real America, where people love their children more than their politics, they're playing a very dangerous game. Because at some point, I'm afraid this will get violent. Parents have recently shown [they're willing](https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/06/06/breaking-massive-brawl-breaks-out-at-glendale-ca-school-board-as-armenian-american-parents-take-on-the-woke-mob-n757376) to resort to blows to protect their children from ideologues, and it won't be the last time. These are our children. Many in the LGBT community probably can't wrap their heads around what that means because to them, children are a tool, but there's a reason almost every creature in the animal kingdom becomes dangerous when you get close to their offspring. There's a deeper love there than the \"love\" they think they represent, and it's the kind of love that stops people from being \"tolerant.\" We won't have a choice.",

    "text": "Yogi Patel of Transformation Through Empowerment Introduces Empowering People in the Workplace: Positive Discipline-Based Leadership Training That Inspires, Motivates, and Transforms Teams By: GetFeatured June 12, 2025 at 03:40 AM EDT San Diego, CA, The modern workplace has evolved significantly over recent decades, and with this evolution comes a new definition of effective leadership that no longer relies solely on command and control.

    "text": "Firefighter Dennis J Mullins, a 34-year veteran, and highly decorated firefighter in Mount Vernon, NY, made the ultimate sacrifice in 1995. Working an active fire in January 1994 he collapsed of a heart attack while pulling a line to a hydrant. He never regained consciousness, remaining in a vegetative state for 371 days, and succumbed to his injuries on January 18, 1995. He was just 59 years old.\nFirefighter Mullins is the only firefighter in the history of the Department to receive the Medal of Valor, the City’s highest award. This award was presented on Memorial Day 1978 for his unselfish and heroic act of saving a fellow firefighter from certain death while battling a multi-alarm blaze in 1977.\nMullins was ventilating a roof with Firefighter Norman when it gave way. Mullins dove and caught Firefighter Norman as he was falling through the roof. He then pulled Norman out of the hole just before the roof collapsed. Norman had caught fire and was badly burned on most of his lower body. Firefighter Norman survived his injuries and credited Mullins with saving his life.\nDennis has been honored at the National Fallen Firefighter Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD, the IAFF Memorial in Colorado Springs, and the Westchester County Fire Training Center in Elmsford, NY. A plaque is also displayed at the Mount Vernon Fire Department headquarters in honor of his sacrifice.\nDennis was also proud Korean Wartime Veteran serving in the 82nd and 101st Airborne. He was laid to rest at Calverton National Cemetery in NY.\nAt the time of his death, Dennis was survived by his wife of 35 years Marilyn, two daughters Susan and Diane, son Thomas, and four grandchildren.\nIn this post 9/11 world we live in, it is often easy to forget those who unselfishly protect us each day. In honor of all the fallen, next time you see one of this Country’s “Bravest” remember the sacrifices they make every day and let them know they are appreciated by just saying Thank You.",

    "title": "Acuerdo con Sindicato de Trabajadores N°1 contribuirá a sostenibilidad financiera de la UACh",
    "text": "- Lo anterior permite modificar parcialmente el contrato colectivo vigente a partir del 01 de enero del año 2024.\nEste miércoles 27 de diciembre en Casa Central de la Universidad Austral de Chile, el Rector de UACh, Dr. Hans Richter B., firmó el anexo de contrato colectivo de trabajo junto a la Presidenta del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores N°1, Solange Doussoulin e integrantes de la Directiva Sindical: Susana Flores (Secretaria), Marianne Loyola (Tesorera), Bernarda Rivera (Primera Directora) y Christian Sanhueza (Segundo Director). En la oportunidad, también estuvieron presentes el Vicerrector de Gestión Económica y Administrativa Dr. Pablo Hormazábal; y el Director Jurídico, Ab. Sergio Valenzuela.\nEsto es el resultado de meses de negociaciones y diálogos con representantes de la directiva sindical, reuniones sostenidas regularmente que fueron encabezadas por el Vicerrector de Gestión Económica y Administrativa con participación del Director de Personal de esta casa de estudios, Raúl Pilquimán y del Director Jurídico. El acuerdo se ratificó en la votación realizada el 21 de diciembre pasado, ocasión en que el 77,5% de socios y socias de la organización aprobaron la propuesta planteada por la autoridad universitaria, que consiste en modificaciones al contrato colectivo vigente necesarias para contribuir a la operación financiera de la institución.\nTras la firma del anexo la Presidenta del Sindicato N°1 de Trabajadores Solange Doussoulin destacó que “este fue un esfuerzo que se hizo pensando en el colectivo, donde tenemos un amplio grupo que tiene necesidades, o son más vulnerables”. A su vez expresó que esta decisión se tomó pensado también en “cuidar nuestra fuente laboral”.\nPor su parte, el Rector Dr. Hans Richter señaló que “con la convicción que este consenso al que hemos llegado es un significativo esfuerzo para nuestros trabajadores y sus familias, valoramos este sustantivo apoyo que contribuye en un corto plazo a los equilibrios financieros, que tanto requerimos para nuestra institución en estos momentos. Y esto es producto de un proceso de diálogo que demoró varios meses, donde se fueron construyendo consensos en torno a ideas compartidas y finalmente tenemos un documento que da cuenta de un decidido apoyo al futuro de la Universidad”.\nLa autoridad universitaria planteó que con esto se está contribuyendo directamente al futuro de la Universidad, donde es relevante el apoyo de directivos, cuerpos colegiados y sindicatos. El Sindicato N°1 en particular, dijo, “logró una votación muy contundente en torno a dos esquemas para avanzar y al mismo tiempo lo que hemos logrado es proteger a los trabajadores de menores ingresos de la Universidad, lo cual es extremadamente importante”.\nAcuerdos del anexo\nEl contenido del anexo zanja, entre otras cosas, dos de las principales preocupaciones en este proceso de recuperación financiera que enfrenta la UACh: el pago anual del bono extraordinario (o décimo tercer sueldo) y reajustes salariales. consiste, entre otros aspectos, en la modificación del contrato colectivo.\nSeñala que se aplicará a los sueldos base en el mes de enero 2024 el 7,1% que corresponde a la diferencia sobre reajustabilidad pendiente de los meses de diciembre 2021 a diciembre 2022. De igual modo, se procede a reajustar los sueldos base, de acuerdo con el IPC acumulado en el año 2023 de todos (as) los (las) trabajadores(as) afiliados (as) al Sindicato Nacional N°1 de Trabajadores de la Universidad Austral de Chile.\nSobre el pago del bono extraordinario, para los años 2024 y 2025, fija que quienes perciben rentas iguales o inferiores al total base de cálculo de $ 1.200.000 lo recibirán en el mes de enero 2024. Para quienes perciban rentas sobre este monto, se generará un compromiso de pago a partir de enero de 2026.\nEl documento firmado incluye otros acuerdos en el marco de los beneficios contenidos en el contrato colectivo original.\nCabe señalar que el instrumento de anexo de contrato colectivo de trabajo fue depositado el día de hoy (27 de diciembre) en la Inspección Provincial del Trabajo de Valdivia, ante la Inspectora Provincial del Trabajo, quien recibió a los dirigentes del Sindicato y al Director Jurídico, en representación de la Universidad, para formalizar la presentación del documento.",

    "text": "That’s what students in Georgia could be hearing less about if a raft of legislation moving through state Senate committees keeps moving before the big legislative deadline at the end of the month. In the final scheduled hearing of the Senate Committee on Education and Youth before Crossover Day Wednesday, senators passed bills aimed at removing “harmful materials” from school libraries and eliminating sex education for fourth-graders and younger. In a separate meeting, the Senate Committee on Government Oversight passed bills aiming to cut ties with the American Library Association, as well as authorizing schools to display the Ten Commandments and employ school chaplains. Education Committee Chair Sen. Clint Dixon’s Senate Bill 394 aims to set up new standards for schools to restrict so-called harmful materials. The sticking point was part of the state’s definition for sexual conduct: “actual or simulated acts of masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse, or physical contact in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification with a person’s clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if such person is female, breasts.” The inclusion of the word homosexuality led some Democrats and members of the public to fear books depicting same-sex relationships would be targeted for removal even if they are not graphic or sexual. Last year, the American Library Association reported an increase in the numbers of books challenged in libraries and that “most of the challenges were to books written by or about a person of color or a member of the LGBTQIA+ community.” A former Cobb County teacher is in an ongoing legal battle after she was fired for reading a picture book called “My Shadow is Purple.” That book is not explicit, but some parents said a book starring a gender non-binary character was not appropriate. “It’s like an attempt to indoctrinate values,” said Atlanta Democratic Sen. Elena Parent. “The claim has been, ‘Oh, there’s all this indoctrination.’ Well, there’s a lot of indoctrination in trying to wipe out discussions about past history, racism or gay kids, and it’s not going to happen, OK?. It’s not going to happen.” “A lot of people driving this think that they have the only, one God-ordained perspective on life, and that’s all they want to hear about, and that’s all they want kids to know, and it’s never going to work,” she added. Dixon said gay people are not being targeted, and the law applies equally to any kind of smut hiding on school shelves. “Thank you, senator, but this is talking about books and sexual material in books. You went off on a tangent that didn’t even pertain to the bill,” he said. “It has to do with sexual content in books, heterosexual, homosexual, any of that. We don’t want to expose our kids to any of that. When they’re minors, there’s no business for them to be looking at any of that.” The committee also passed a library bill backed by Cumming Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal that removes an exception for school libraries in state code banning distribution of materials harmful to minors. Librarians said they feared they could lose their jobs if they inadvertently hand out a book a parent finds objectionable. The committee approved an amendment to the bill carving out a defense for libraries that have made good faith efforts to remove all harmful materials. An effort to cut ties with the American Library Association over culture war clashes also moved through committee after sponsor Sen. Larry Walker, a Perry Republican, removed language that vexed librarians and the schools that teach them. Walker said the latest version of the bill would allow Valdosta State University to continue paying the ALA to accredit its library master’s program. Dixon also found approval for a bill reshaping how and when Georgia students learn about the birds and bees. His SB 532 would prohibit sex education before fifth grade and state that no public school system would be required to offer sex education at all. Instead of parents who don’t want their kids learning about sex from their teachers opting out, parents who do like that idea would have to opt in under the bill. Dixon said the bill allows for age-appropriate lessons on child abuse awareness and prevention as well as menstruation. Stephanie Tanner, a lobbyist with the Georgia School Board Association, said the opt-in feature could rile local districts. “Our major concern with the way the bill reads is that it overrides local control and requires sex education to be an opt-in by parents,” she said. “Currently, as we’ve discussed, state law requires parents to be allowed to review the materials for sex education and opt their child out of sex ed. So just a little unclear about that piece of the bill, what the goal is there. It feels overly burdensome and like we’re creating this time consuming administrative and record-keeping process and that doesn’t seem to go with the spirit of the bill otherwise.” Tyrone Sen. Marty Harbin’s SB 501 allows schools to place copies of the Ten Commandments in each classroom, and his SB 379 could help bring in someone to explain what they mean by bringing in chaplains to serve in schools. “We have chaplains currently in our military, we have chaplains in our prisons and correctional institutes, we have chaplains in our universities and colleges, our sports teams have them, fire and police all have chaplains, but a chaplain is missing in the sense of our schools today,” he said.” Harbin said chaplains will be able to perform many of the duties of school counselors but also be more of an informal advisor and confidant. Georgia ACLU First Amendment policy advocate Sarah Hunt-Blackwell said her group does not agree. “We oppose this bill because it jeopardizes the safety and well-being of non-Christian students and LGBTQ+ students in Georgia,” she said. “There’s no language accounting for the First Amendment right of religious expression for all religious beliefs. Most chaplains are ‘Christian-based, readied with a biblical perspective.’ That’s a direct quote from the National School Chaplain Association website.” Georgia Recorder is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
