    "text": "- cross-posted to:\nhackernews@lemmy.bestiver.se\n- cross-posted to:\nhackernews@lemmy.bestiver.se\nI’m not well versed in C&C, but it’s always good to see more games open sourced.\nlog in or registerto comment.\nThis is brilliant! :) aw, I hope it benefits the OpenRA developers and means more fun things to play eventually :)\nWait… this is EA… are they okay? This is very unlike them\nI hope everyone’s SSDs have enough SPACE\nTo use the compiled binaries, you must own the game\nWas expecting a catch. Still good for modding I guess\nAnyone know if this is a technologically-enforced “must” or just a “pretty please”?\nOpen source does not mean that the intellectual property is free. There’s a lot of good that comes from this, and it’s not like those games are expensive.\nThough do also note that of these four, TD and RA1 were already made freeware years ago.\nI realize. Intellectual property is an icky concept IMO but I know not everyone agrees\nIntellectual property is what allows them to make these games GPL.\nThe entire series is on sale on Steam right now for $6 if that helps.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1213210/Command__Conquer_Remastered_Collection/That’s only the HD remaster of TD and RA1.\nIt’s about thyme!\nNo matter what you think of EA, this is fantastic news.\nPerhaps why this feels like them trying to save face.\nThis feels more like some o.g. Command and conquer devs who have worked at EA for a long time that are passionate about the franchise. There was no big PR release, no product tie in or announcement, no media campaign.\nRecovering and restoring the source code for these titles was made possible through the combined efforts of EA technical director Brian Barnes, Respawn producer Jim Vessella, and Luke Feenan, a long-standing member of the C&C community who was involved in the development of the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection.\nhttps://www.polygon.com/news/531365/command-and-conquer-open-source-code-eaIIRC, a few years ago EA hired some of the original devs, put them in charge of the franchise, and then went very hands-off, but with very little budget. So far they’ve done this, and a very reasonably priced 4K remaster of TD and RA1.\nAh well I’m glad to see the devs sticking to their passions. I’m sure they’re proud of this move.\nWith that said, I’m still surprised EA didn’t try to capitalize on it somehow.\nOn what?\nJust in general. EA has a lot to around for.\nExtremely rare EA win\nOpen sourcing old games is awesome for video game preservation.\nOld games being open sourced is a trend I can get behind.\nFuck EA but cool move - if they keep being not shit for long enough I might consider their products again.\nDoubt they can keep it up.\nI’m ready for a zero hour remake!\nIm now just happy that it’s far more likely for a clean 60fps mod that’s not locked behind someone’s patreon\nIt’s a kick ass game but some of the tropes didn’t age well.\nAk47s for everyone!\nCan I at least have some shoes?\nEA ? Did I read right ?\nMmmmm pre-standard C++\nRENEGADE!!!\nLoved Renegade so much. Played the shit out of the MP back in the day.\nThat game seemed so underappreciated. I would be thrilled if I could have another LAN party with it.\nWell I’m very excited to see the injection of life this hopefully gives c&c modding\nI wonder how many of the old guard are still around, I’m glad the cncnet project is still going strong",

    "title": "Ubisoft Delays Assassin's Creed Shadows, Avoids Questions From Investors",
    "text": "The studio's \"last chance at a comeback\" has been postponed by another month.\nFor Ubisoft, the turn of the year hasn't brought much change, as the once-renowned developer continues going through by far the most tumultuous period in its history. The same issues that plagued the studio in 2024 – namely games flopping [one](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-s-call-of-duty-killer-xdefiant-to-shut-down-next-year/) [after](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-spent-usd650-to-usd850-million-on-skull-and-bones/) [another](https://80.lv/articles/not-a-single-star-wars-outlaws-player-has-unlocked-their-own-fathier-yet/), a declining stock price, and the looming possibility of a [Tencent takeover](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-confirms-tencent-buyout-discussions/) – persist into 2025, with many [now agreeing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1hxhyde/assassins_creed_shadows_delayed_again/) that Assassin's Creed Shadows represents Ubisoft's last chance at a comeback, and should the game fail, it would spell the end for the iconic developer.\nUbisoft\nApparently, the studio's higher-ups are well aware of what's at stake, as they recently postponed Assassin's Creed Shadows [for the second time](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-postpones-assassin-s-creed-shadows-release-until-2025/) to give the development team enough time to deliver an \"engaging Day-1 experience.\"\nBy moving the release date from February 14 to March 20, 2025, Ubisoft [aims](https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf) to \"allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community.\" As to what exactly this plan entails and which \"player feedback\" they want to incorporate, those questions remained unanswered.\n\"Since November, we've been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,\" said Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Coté [in a statement](https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126). \"Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we've already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.:\nWhile it could indeed be the case and Ubisoft truly needs an extra month to fix Shadows' reported [bugs](https://80.lv/articles/yasuke-bugs-poor-outlaws-sales-details-on-assassin-s-creed-shadows-delay/) and [cultural](https://80.lv/articles/japanese-politician-investigates-assassin-s-creed-shadows-over-cultural-inaccuracies/) and [historical](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-apologized-for-using-reenactment-group-s-flag-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows/) inaccuracies, many online believe a different explanation is more likely: the company, already reeling from last year's setbacks, is trying to avoid competition as best they can.\nEver since the game was first delayed to February 2025, the gaming community has questioned why Ubisoft would deliberately choose a month overflowing with major game releases, including Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization 7, Avowed, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, and Monster Hunter Wilds. While no studio, Ubisoft included, would ever openly admit to being afraid of their competitors for fear of being accused of \"chickening out\" and losing shareholders' trust, it's impossible to deny that many now believe this is exactly what happened, and the company simply wants their new Assassin's Creed title to compete with as few games as possible.\nUbisoft\nSpeaking about shareholders' trust, following the news of Shadows' delay, Ubisoft held an emergency conference call with investors, during which CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet demonstrated their expertise in delivering non-answers to questions from representatives of various firms, who, understandably, are quite concerned about Ubisoft's current state.\nAs reported by [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes), a representative from Morgan Stanley asked the executives about the \"transformation strategic and capitalistic options\" highlighted in the company's [official statement](https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf), seeking clarification on what this vague phrasing actually means, to which Duguet responded as follows:\n\"The objective of this process is to unlock the best value potential of our assets to the benefit of our stakeholders and to foster the best conditions to create great games in the fast-evolving market. That's the overall objective, so that's why we mentioned that we appointed leading advisors. So we are currently actively exploring different options. And we can't say more. Of course, we won't comment on specific rumors we have seen in the market, but we are convinced there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft assets and franchises. We will inform the market if and when a transaction materializes.\"\nWith Duguet's response being even vaguer than the phrase in the original question, the representative pressed further, asking \"Whether there are any concrete courses of action or scenarios that are being considered, or is this more of an exploratory kind of process?\" to which Duguet gave a laconic reply, saying they are \"limited with what we can say today, but we've started a process with advisors,\" ultimately offering little reassurance.\nAdditionally, Guillemot and Duguet avoided questions about the Tencent acquisition, only stating that shareholders can expect \"good progress\" in the coming months, declined to specify how many AAA games Ubisoft will ship in the coming fiscal year, replying that we'll \"know more by May,\" and sidestepped the question about the specific players' feedback that led to Assassin's Creed: Shadows second delay, repeating the line from the aforementioned statement about \"the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community\" without actually addressing the question at all.\nConsidering Ubisoft's apparent disregard for the gaming community's wishes, evident in both their projects and statements about gamers [feeling comfortable with not owning their games](https://80.lv/articles/ubisoft-executive-players-should-get-comfortable-with-not-owning-games/), as well as their reluctance to properly address the questions and concerns of their own investors, only one question remains – if not gamers or investors, whose interests is Ubisoft serving then?\nLeave your thoughts in the comments and don't forget to join our [80 Level Talent platform](https://80.lv/talent) and our [new Discord server](https://discord.gg/80lv), follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eighty_level/), [Twitter](https://x.com/80Level), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/80-lv), [Telegram](https://t.me/LevelEightyNews), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@eightylevel), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@eighty_level), where we share breakdowns, the latest news, awesome artworks, and more.",

    "text": "A dredging project that was set to begin Friday in the Marina del Rey harbor has been delayed until Monday due to inclement weather, county officials said Thursday.\nThe five-month-long dredging effort by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected to remove about 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards of sediment — enough to fill 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools — that has accumulated along the harbor’s north jetty, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. County officials said shoaling has made navigation difficult in the area for boaters and first-responders.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers will use a vessel knows as Sea Horse in the dredging effort.\nAccording to county officials, as the Sea Horse dredges, the sediment will be loaded onto a dump scow and deposited in the Pacific Ocean near the shore of Dockweiler State Beach — north of Imperial Highway in Playa del Rey.\nThe scow is expected to make four to five trips per day, officials said.\nCounty officials expect that the 24-hour dredging operation will make certain portions of the harbor entrance impassible for periods of time.\nThe Department of Beaches and Harbors will be posting information regarding accessibility to the harbor on social media sites.\nAbout $7.18 million toward the dredging was funded through federal budget appropriations for the project, which aims to ensure safe navigation of the harbor entrance for the U.S. Coast Guard, first-responders and about 4,300 recreational boats docked at Marina del Rey’s harbor.",

    "text": "在近日的一次公开分享中，法拉第未来（Faraday Future，简称FF）创始人兼CEO贾跃亭详细介绍了公司的运营情况，并透露了一系列令人瞩目的进展。他指出，2024年FF在成本控制方面取得了显著成效，每个月的平均经营费用已降至约500万美元，与2023年相比下降了超过75%。 贾跃亭表示，这一数字相当于某些主流车企一天的经营亏损，因此可以毫不夸张地说，2024年是FF历史上成本控制能力最强的一年。他强调，在大力降本的同时，FF并没有牺牲任何发展速度，反而在有限的资源下创造了巨大的价值。\n为了证明这一点，贾跃亭介绍了FF在产品研发和品牌建设方面的最新进展。他透露，公司不仅已经启动了大规模放量第二品牌FX，还陆续开启了三个产品序列、四款产品原型车的研发和测试工作。目前，FF正处于FX首辆车下线任务的冲刺阶段，这一消息无疑为公司的未来发展注入了新的动力。 对于如何在有限的资源下实现如此显著的成果，贾跃亭分享了他的秘诀。他认为，关键在于用更小的团队、更快的响应、更聚焦的资源、更轻的模式来运营公司。通过将这些有限的资金真正花在创造核心价值的地方，FF得以在成本控制和产品创新之间找到了完美的平衡点。 此外，贾跃亭还分享了他对创业过程的深刻见解。他指出，从0到1的阶段需要坚定的信念和创造力，而从1到10则需要强大的执行力和极致的效率。当企业发展到10到100的阶段时，则需要构建完善的组织体系和生态能力来支撑企业的持续增长。 他强调，对于那些真正走在创业路上的人来说，这些挑战都是不可或缺的。没有那种在车库里颠覆世界的狠劲儿，没有省出每一分钱做出好产品的执着，以及在夹缝中创造独特价值的思维，是无法在激烈的市场竞争中破局的。 贾跃亭的分享不仅展示了FF在成本控制和产品研发方面的显著成果，也传递了他对创业精神的深刻理解和坚定信念。随着FF在新能源汽车领域的不断深耕和拓展，我们有理由相信，这家创新型企业将在未来创造更多令人瞩目的成就。 本文属于原创文章，如若转载，请注明来源： 贾跃亭分享FF运营情况，每月经营费用约500万美元 https://smartwear.zol.com.cn/968/9684028.html",

    "text": "A loyalist protest at a Catholic girls school in north Belfast in 2001 was a sign of a “deeper malaise” in Northern Ireland according to Bertie Ahern , new archives show.Officials who compiled documentation of efforts to resolve the protest also noted criticisms of DUP MP for Belfast North Nigel Dodds for his actions, and said that then First Minister David Trimble’s efforts were integral.For months in 2001, locals at Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast stood outside the school as girls and parents walked inThe protest began following a clash in June 2001 as a man collected his child.“He was, according to nationalists, attacked by loyalists when he objected to them putting up paramilitary flags on the Ardoyne Road,” a briefing note stated.Efforts to resolve the issue over the summer break failed, and the protests resumed in the autumn.Loyalists said they were protesting because of attacks on their community, which they claimed were prompted by the larger Catholic population and wanted better security in the Ardoyne area as a result.The note from November said: “The hate-filled aggression the loyalist protesters showed to the primary school girls and their families has disturbed, dismayed, and angered people throughout Northern Ireland and in the wider world beyond.”On October 18 2001, Fr Aidan Troy had an hour-long meeting with Mr Ahern in which he discussed the impasse over the protest, which had been ongoing for months.Fr Troy, parish priest of Ardoyne and chair of the board of governors of the Holy Cross school, said that there were around 20 people on both sides of the road in the morning, and 60-70 people on each side in the afternoon.“A hard core” of local residents took part in the protests and there was also a “sinister” loyalist paramilitary involvement, as well as people from other loyalist areas taking part, according to notes taken of the meeting.Fr Troy said that some residents from Glenbryn, the protestant and loyalist area around the school, expressed support for his work, usually anonymously because of the “climate of fear” surrounding those who opposed the protest.He said that some children and parents had been subjected to abuse including “balloons filled with dog excrement and urine, scalding water, stones and a blast-bomb”.A blast bomb attack had taken place the day before the meeting on Alliance Avenue.Of the 220 pupils at the school, 35 were stressed and receiving counselling and medication, and 10 had been transferred to other schools.The priest expressed concern that the protest could “drag on indefinitely”, as it was a no-cost effort from protesters, and said this could put an “intolerable strain” on the school community.He also said that there was “a leadership vacuum” in Glenbryn, which was an impediment to progress, and the referral to a committee of 14 people with “no common agenda” made it difficult to find a resolution.Fr Troy also said that while he appreciated the work of police to protect children on the way to school, he was “unhappy” that protesters were allowed to be so close that they were able to “spit at the children” and was confused as to why armed soldiers faced towards the parents and children.Mr Ahern said that the root causes of the protests were a “symptom of a deeper malaise within Northern Ireland”.He offered to raise the issue during a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair the next day, but said that genuine progress could only be achieved through engagement and agreement at local level.Fergal Mythen, an Irish official in the Security Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, compiled the notes of the meeting on October 22 2001.In notes taken by the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat, dated November 21, it said Fr Troy was “reasonably confident” of an end or suspension to the protest ahead of a meeting with Mr Trimble and deputy first minister Mark Durkan.Mr Dodds, who was to chair a meeting of residents at Stormont, was noted as a sign of a possible deal, as “Dodds has sat on the loyalist fence on may issues and is not known to stick his neck out unduly”.In a briefing dated November 26, it called Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan’s meeting with Glenbryn residents the previous week, as well as a prompt follow-up letter “instrumental in creating the climate for a discontinuation of the protest”.The material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/67.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "text": "Spokane County Sheriff's deputies shot and killed a man Tuesday night who neighbors said had been harassing and threatening them.\nDeputies went to the 6600 block of North Calispel Street Tuesday afternoon after reports that a man armed with what was described as a baton was threatening to kill a person in the neighborhood, Sheriff John Nowels told reporters Tuesday night a couple of blocks from the shooting scene.\nA resident on Calispel Street told deputies his neighbor came on his property on Monday night and broke a light he had set up for security. Deputies could have arrested the man on suspicion of misdemeanor malicious mischief and criminal trespassing.\nHowever, Nowels said deputies decided not to arrest the suspect because he was uncooperative and the nature of the misdemeanor charges.\nDeputies were called back to the home again Monday night because the suspect returned to his neighbor's property and was dismantling another security light, according to a press release from the sheriff's office. Again the suspect declined to speak with officers and they decided to leave.\nThen at about 4:20 p.m. Tuesday the neighbor reported that the man was threatening him. He told investigators that he was outside on a ladder repairing a light broken the day before when the man approached holding what he believed to be a baton over his head, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The neighbor provided video of the encounter to deputies.\nAnother neighbor, Duane Dumaw said the victim and the suspect lived across the street from each other. They used to be friendly, but had since been arguing. Other neighbors in the area said it had escalated in the last two days — deputies had come and gone multiple times, and there were constant issues with the suspect acting oddly around the neighborhood.\n\"He was having problems with the neighbor down there ... over security cameras, lights shining in the house. I don't know what the deal was, but he didn't like it. So he went and tore it down. That's what started this,\" Dumaw said.\nAt about 5:40 p.m. Tuesday, deputies decided to arrest the suspect for attempted second-degree assault and harassment with threats to kill .\n\"They were down there at about five o'clock. But then it escalated from there. And then this whole street was full of police cars,\" Dumaw said about that night.\nHe was friendly with the suspect, who would often walk his dog around the neighborhood. But that is the extent of his interactions.\nNowels said the suspect was uncooperative and refused to exit his home.\nGiven the new felony charges, Nowels said the sheriff's office believed the suspect was a significant risk to the public, so it decided an arrest was necessary.\nDeputies consulted with the SWAT team and determined the team wasn't needed.\n\"It was decided that patrol could safely handle this situation,\" Nowels said.\nThe sheriff's office received a signed search warrant at about 6:30 p.m. for the arrest of the suspect and to search the residence for evidence of the felony crimes.\nDeputies told the suspect over the public address system several times he was under arrest, Nowels said.\nHostage negotiators made phone contact with the suspect inside the house. He said negotiators advised him several times he was under arrest and needed to come out of the home.\nNegotiators spoke with the suspect on the phone until about 6:50 p.m. when the suspect hung up the phone. The sheriff's office resumed loud speaker announcements.\nAt 6:54 p.m., deputies breached the front door. At 6:55, they reported that the suspect \"aggressed on them and shots were fired,\" Nowels said.\nThe suspect died.\nNowels said a law enforcement dog was injured and taken to a veterinarian clinic for surgery. He did not know the extent of the dog's injuries.\nOn Wednesday, sheriff's spokesperson Cpl. Mark Gregory said that the dog was doing well, but is still being evaluated. Gregory declined to say how the dog was injured.\nA deputy received minor injuries but was not taken to the hospital, he said.\nFour deputies who the sheriff's office believed fired their weapons were placed on administrative leave, which is standard officer-involved shooting protocol, the release said.\nNowels confirmed deputies fired their weapons but did not release whether the suspect did. He did not release how many deputies fired and whether the suspect had a weapon.\nPolice cars, with their emergency lights illuminated, blocked surrounding streets for several hours Tuesday night as law enforcement investigated.\n\"I need to emphasize, beginning with the incidents last night, deputies deescalated this situation as much as they could, and the preliminary information I have today indicates that the suspect aggressed on them at the door, and that's when they acted,\" Nowels said.\nThe Spokane Independent Investigative Response Team is investigating. The Spokane Police Department is the leading investigating agency and the Washington State Patrol is assisting.\nThe Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office will release the name of the man who was killed.\n___\n(c)2024 The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.)\nVisit The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.) at www.spokesman.com\nDistributed by\nTribune Content Agency, LLC.",

La enfermedad que padece el Papa Francisco\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha informado que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\nLe puede interesar: El cuadro clínico del Papa es complejo y requerirá una hospitalización adecuada\n\"El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables\", se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia\" de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el \"cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada\", lo que hace prever que el Papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.",

    "text": "General News of Thursday, 28 December 2023\nSource:\n[www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php)\nOn December 27, 2023, the fourth Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr Michael Nutmy passed away at the age of 65.\nHaving commenced his apostolic journey at a young age, Ntumy lived a dedicated life towards the propagation of Christianity and The Church of Pentecost.\nHe was born at Dadieso in the Oti Region of Ghana and begun his professional life as a teacher in Yendi in the 1980s before becoming a deacon, and an elder of the church.\nHe was called to office as an apostle at the age of 33 and begin a journey of traversing various parts of the country and the world to spread the gospel.\nAs part of his apostolic journey, Dr Ntumy faced various trials in tribulations including wars, sicknesses and accidents that bore testament to his unflinching commitment towards the work of Ghana.\nOne of such experiences the apostle had was during the Liberian Civil of 1989 to 1997.\nApostle Nutmy who was a pastor in the Buchanan District of Liberia during the time of war became a source of motivation for several Liberians and members of the Buchanan community which was predominantly a Ghanaian community.\nIn the heat of the war, Apostle Ntumy was taken captive together with his family by the National Patriotic Front Party of Charles Taylor.\nThe apostle, his wife and children were held in the heart of the Nimba Forest where he was assaulted and poisoned.\nDespite his ordeal, a resilient Apostle Ntumy continued to be a source of encouragement for other hostages including members of his church.\nTestimonies of Apostle Ntumy’s resilience during the period was shared by members of the Buchanan District Church of Pentecost in 2022.\nElder John Baidoo, presiding elder at the now Prayer Tower Assembly, the central chapel of the Buchanan district, where Apostle Ntumy used to fellowship, testified about the impact Apostle Ntumy had on the members of the church in the district.\n“According to the elders I met, Apostle Ntumy laid his life down for most of the members here. He [Apostle Ntumy] came back three years ago and encouraged us.\n“I remember the sermon he preached: ‘When I saw him I held fast to him but I now leave him.’ That sermon brought revival to the church here in Liberia. The sermon topic is now on everyone’s lips. Our father’s presence in Buchanan has really lifted the church high.”\nA community leader amongst the fisherfolks and an elder of the church, Elder Joseph Kwame Persewaa also said: “If Apostle Ntumy was with us here now, we would have carried him up high on our shoulders. This is because spiritually he really worked. It is because of Apostle Ntumy’s works that we had confidence and courage to remain in the church. His lifestyle drew many to the church.”\nHe added: “I was present at Flamingo (the camp of no return) during the war when Apostle Ntumy prophesied that no one would die, and indeed non-members of The Church of Pentecost saw the hand and power of God and got converted.”\nThe Area Head for Buchanan Area and National Secretary of the Church in Liberia, Apostle Quie G. Toe, was full of praise for Apostle Ntumy. According to him, the successes and achievements of the Area were a result of the selfless leadership of Apostle Ntumy during his days in Liberia.\n“Before every fishing season, Apostle Ntumy would gather members of the church who are fisherfolks and pray with them. This led to the introduction of a prayer and fasting programme that helped the fisherfolks to experience bumper harvests.\n“This prayer programme has come to stay. The leadership of the church supports the Ghanaian fisherfolks to organise this prayer programme at the beginning of every fishing season,” he added.\nThroughout his apostolic career, the late Apostle Ntumy served as the Missionary of The Church of Pentecost to Liberia, Ivory Coast, France/Switzerland, from 1988-1998.\nHis tenure as chairperson of the church commenced in 1998 and ended in 2008 after two terms (ten years).\nOn his 54th birthday, Apostle Ntumy wrote an article in which talked about all the trials he had been through and how and how his faith in the lord saved him\nRead the article written by Apostle Ntumy on his 54th birthday\nAs I ponder and reflect over the course of my life so far, I realize the exceptional grace God has bestowed on me. I am not going to talk about promotion, position, power, achievements and accomplishments. I am going to share with you about troubles, trials and tears, interlaced with amazing triumphs and testimonies resulting in thanksgiving to God. The enemy of our souls forgets that his orchestrations against us rather result to the praise of God in the long run.\nIn fact, Apostle Paul said that if he had to boast, he would rather boast about his sufferings for the sake of Christ. My catalogue, however, does not come anywhere near that of Apostles.\n1. Been through four wars (Two in Northern Ghana, one each in Liberia and Ivory Coast) Charles Gangay Taylor, Leader of Liberia’s NPFL\n2. Taken hostage for 163 days in the heart of the Nimba Forest in Liberia by Charles Taylor’s NPFL rebels while serving as missionary in that country\n3. Survived three accidents— two on the road, one on the Volta Lake in Ghana. A Vessel On The Volta Lake\nSurely if my life were in my own hands, I would have lost it long ago.\n4. Survived an assassination attempt on my life while serving as the youngest-ever Chairman of The Church of Pentecost.\n5. Survived two food poisoning attempts against me\n6. Tasted hospitalization for 332 days in 2009/2010\n7. Tasting the pains and agonies of paralysis for 1,211 days (to date), moving about in an electric wheelchair.\nHowever, there is an INVISIBLE HAND THAT HOLDS, SUSTAINS and NOURISHES US. THROUGH IT ALL, being kept by THE POWER OF GOD.\nCome, beloved, praise the LORD with me.\nTHANK GOD FOR THE GIFT OF MY LIFE. He has upheld me very tenaciously through it all.Crushed, but not destroyed.\nStand with me in prayer as I go through this phase of my life, doing business for the Kingdom of God even through this “out of season” period.\nBelieve with me that the expected miracle shall take place soon for His glory.\nAll these could not have happened for nought. God is definitely up to something.\nGA/SARA",

    "text": "Marta Barrachina reitera el apoyo de la Diputación a la Semana Santa y ensalza el valor religioso y cultural de La Passió de Torreblanca “Esta celebración, única y singular en la provincia de Castellón, pone en valor el factor sentimental, el tradicional, la fe y la pasión” La presidenta de la Diputación Provincial de Castellón, Marta Barrachina, ha reiterado el apoyo de la institución provincial a la Semana Santa y ha ensalzado el valor religioso y cultural de La Passió de Torreblanca, “una cita ineludible para miles de vecinos de toda la provincia, motivo de orgullo y tradición”, ha resaltado la presidenta. La máxima representante de la institución provincial ha realizado estas declaraciones durante su asistencia a la representación teatral de La Passió de Torreblanca 2024 que ha tenido lugar la noche de este Jueves Santo. “La Passió de Torreblanca, única y singular en la provincia de Castellón, pone en valor el factor sentimental, el tradicional, la fe y la pasión que se pone de manifiesto en unos días que rememoran la Pasión, Muerte y Resurrección de Cristo”, ha asegurado la presidenta. En este sentido, Marta Barrachina ha señalado que La Passió de Torreblanca, declarada Fiesta de interés Turístico Provincial, y que cuenta con el apoyo de la institución, es una parada obligatoria en el mapa de la Semana Santa en la provincia de Castellón. Al respecto, la dirigente provincial ha remarcado que “para la Diputación es un orgullo contar con estas celebraciones de la provincia, y la implicación de los vecinos y vecinas de Torreblanca por conservar y transmitir de generación en generación esta cita, la convierte en seña de identidad del municipio y de la provincia en su conjunto”. La Passió de Torreblanca es una de las dramatizaciones más importantes y antiguas de la provincia de Castellón, “una emotiva representación que hace pueblo, porque mantiene viva la unión de todos los vecinos preparando la representación durante todo el año”, ha señalado la presidenta de la institución provincial. Esta representación fue estrenada el 12 de abril de 1979 y desde entonces se realiza cada Jueves Santo en las calles del pueblo, los escenarios son naturales y es todo el pueblo el que se vuelva en ella. La Passió de Torreblanca se realiza totalmente en valenciano y en ella participan más de centenar de personas, todas ellas vecinas de Torreblanca, como actores y actrices. Marta Barrachina ha disfrutado de la representación y ha mostrado el compromiso de la Diputación de Castellón por reforzar su apoyo a una celebración “que nos identifica y que requiere el apoyo de la institución”. En este sentido, la primera presidenta ha recordado el convenio de colaboración entre la Diputación de Castellón y la Asociación La Passió de Torreblanca para la concesión de la subvención directa de 12.000 euros para la celebración de este acto. Un convenio que ella mismo recuperó el pasado ejercicio, después de que en 2019, el anterior equipo de gobierno decidiera suspenderlo. Sin duda, esta subvención de 12.000 euros forma parte del “compromiso de este gobierno provincial por preservar la cultura y las tradiciones porque son una muestra de nuestro pasado y también de nuestro presente”, ha asegurado la presidenta de la Diputación. Asimismo, ha manifestado que “este convenio de colaboración nos permite consolidar la apuesta por dotar nuestra provincia de atractivos para que cada vez sean más los argumentos que tengan los visitantes para poder venir a nuestra tierra”, ha concluido Marta Barrachina.",
