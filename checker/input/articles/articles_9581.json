    "text": "Sicamous RCMP responded to fewer incidents in the last quarter of 2023 than the previous year, with crime and traffic statistics both seeing a decrease. In a report to district council at its Jan. 10 meeting, Sgt. Murray McNeil said officers issued 122 tickets to drivers, down from 134 the year before, and added that the lack of precipitation had resulted in slightly less collisions despite December’s snowy start that resulted in a fatality. “The last couple of days we’ve been having this snow and, knock on wood, we’ve come out really well with it,” he said. “I was certain that we would have numerous collisions today based on the conditions that I saw driving around…but we didn’t have any collisions to report, which was surprising.” Overall crime stats saw an even greater decrease, from 429 to 373, with the biggest drop being driving complaints that were less than half of last year at 29 as compared to 67, which McNeil said could again be partly due to better road conditions. Frauds, however, jumped to six compared to just two last year, and McNeil said the RCMP will be holding a public session on fraud detection as per a request by Coun. Pam Beech. “Some of the frauds that we were seeing were the elderly getting contacted and asked to invest in different Bitcoin and things like that, some of these confusing things that promise excellent returns,” said McNeil. “So hopefully if we get a bit of an information session we can get some education out on that.” A constable from Salmon Arm will be conducting the meeting in the Sicamous library, with McNeil trying to schedule it for some time in February, with a second session also planned for the seniors centre. Those will be advertised as details are confirmed.",

    "text": "Microsoft is—once again—in hot water over its Copilot AI, this time because it is giving users unauthorized access to emails and documents. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, one of Copilot’s biggest critics, posted a message on X about the issue. According to the Business Insider article Benioff links to, Copilot is oversharing information to such a degree that some companies are delaying deployment of the tool. Despite the issue, Microsoft says Copilot is not to blame, with companies’ lax data-governance models being the real culprit. “Many data-governance challenges in the context of AI were not caused by AI’s arrival,” a Microsoft spokesperson told BI. “Microsoft is helping customers enhance their central governance of identities and permissions, to help organizations continuously update and manage these fundamental controls,” the spokesperson added. The issue seems to stem from the way AI models work, consuming and indexing content in order to provide insights and perform tasks based on it. Evidently, become some organizations do not have strong data-governance policies in place, Copilot is making sensitive information available to employees who shouldn’t have access to that information. While not technically a Copilot problem, Microsoft is nonetheless rolling out changes designed to help companies identify data-governance issues and address them, as the company describes. For Copilot administrators, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. Existing administrators can also be unfamiliar with how some features can enhance their data security. To address the need for shorter, actionable, and prescriptive guidance, you can use this deployment blueprint. In this deployment blueprint, we provide a recommended approach to address internal oversharing concerns throughout a Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment. Administrators can find the deployment blueprint here , and are encouraged to make any necessary changes to ensure proper data access.",

Leer más: ¿Cuánto cuesta el viaje para ver a Junior ante Colo Colo en Chile? Según la lectura del juez, el también excandidato presidencial, deberá pagar 64 meses , más de cinco años, de casa por cárcel por el delito de interés indebido en celebración de contrato a título de autor , en Vitalogic. Hernández habría presionado en la asignación del contrato de la consultoría a Jorge Alarcón , por un valor de 360 millones de pesos , adjudicado a la Empresa de Aseo de Bucaramanga .En la investigación se determinó que el objetivo de dicho contrato era otorgar a la consultoría el poder para elaborar los pliegos de licitación , para elegir al operador de la nueva tecnología del manejo de basuras en el relleno sanitario El Carrasco por los siguientes 30 años. Le sugerimos: Reportan caso de homicidio en la calle 72 con carrera 41 Cabe recordar que en la audiencia del pasado 14 de marzo se determinó que el hijo del implicado, Luis Carlos Hernández , habría enviado unos correros a funcionarios de la Alcaldía de Bucaramanga y a la empresa de aseo EMAB , sustentando el interés en el contrato de consultoría.Además, en la pasada audiencia el exalcalde Hernández rompió en llanto al confesar que padecía de cáncer terminal . Sin embargo, esto no fue motivo para retrasar el proceso condenatorio que este jueves se hizo efectivo.
