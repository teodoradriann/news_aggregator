    "title": "Psych Spa Center Offers Free Psychological Services To Support Palestinians Facing War Trauma: Watch PNN Video | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "( MENAFN - Palestine News Network ) Bethlehem / PNN /\nAmid the Israeli war, Palestinians endure profound suffering from killings, bombings, and displacement in Gaza, as well as demolitions and killings in the West Bank. The continuous Israeli onslaught reflects on their emotions and psyche, prompting action to aid them in finding peace after witnessing the horrors of war.\nTo confront the psychological impact of Israeli aggression, Jumana Kaplanian Halabi, Director of the Psych Spa Center, seeks to educate Palestinians about their mental well-being. She aims to empower them to face the psychological aftermath of the ongoing Israeli genocide.\nKaplanian a psychological specialist and the center's director, emphasizes the need for rest and moments of vulnerability for heroes within the Palestinian community to recharge and continue their journey.\nSpeaking to PNN within the framework of a project funded by the French Agency for Development and International Cooperation, Kaplanian elaborated on the center's efforts to enhance psychological resilience and instill optimism and security in people's minds. Their goal is to assist individuals in enduring and persisting with their lives.\nThe idea for the center emerged after Jumana completed her master's degree at Oxford Brookes University in the UK. Eager to serve her community, she returned to Palestine, applying the skills she acquired to contribute to her nation's well-being.\nIn response to the recent aggression, Jumana initiated free mental health services, acknowledging the significant need for psychological support. Despite facing limitations, she and her team strive to provide counseling and consultations to help people cope with the psychological aftermath of war.\nThe center focuses on specialized group and individual services for women, recognizing their crucial role in maintaining family stability amidst challenging circumstances. Since the October 7th Israeli assault, the center has conducted group sessions with trained yoga instructors, offering a means of release from trauma.\nAs a psychological professional, Jumana accompanies these sessions, ensuring follow-up interventions for individuals needing deeper, individualized support after group sessions. The Psych Spa Center's efforts aim to empower Palestinians to overcome the psychological challenges wrought by the war, fostering resilience and well-being within the community.\nThe Psych Spa Center is on a mission to offer guidance to people on coping with psychological diseases resulting from the ongoing war. She addresses issues such as feelings of isolation, loss, and shock, emphasizing the importance of physical movement as a means of liberation from emotions like helplessness and guilt.\nIn the face of the inability to influence the challenging reality of the Palestinian people, Jumana highlights the significance of any movement, whether going to work, assisting others, or engaging in family routines, to counter negative emotions and depression. She stresses the importance of maintaining a routine and engaging in activities that alleviate negativity.\nThe Psych Spa Center organizes specialized activities for children, creating safe spaces for them to express their feelings collectively. Employing a collective healing approach, the center aims to confront the collective trauma experienced by the community, fostering communal healing.\nExpressing regret for the limited psychological treatments available in Palestine, Jumana discusses the challenges posed by the prolonged war, where even natural disasters like earthquakes, with their immediate psychological interventions, differ from the ongoing situation. The center strives to provide basic psychological first aid, acknowledging its limitations due to the persistent conflict.\nShe emphasizes that the free services offered by the center, whether group or individual sessions, represent the minimum duty they can fulfill for their people. These services, part of their social responsibility during the war, also serve as a means for the psychological professionals to address their own emotions and feelings of contribution.\nPsych Spa Center, the first of its kind in Palestine, serves as an educational and psychological wellness retreat. Designed as a social café, it challenges societal stigma associated with psychological treatment. The center focuses on raising awareness about mental health, promoting the importance of caring for one's mental well-being in a culture that sometimes misunderstands psychological treatment .\nThis report was produced as part of Qarib regional Project, funded by the French Development Agency and implemented by the French Development Agency's media arm, CFI: 'We\nMENAFN08032024000205011050ID1107951931\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "A Louisiana woman has [filed](https://lailluminator.com/2023/12/27/chalmette-woman-files-suit-to-keep-trump-off-louisiana-ballot-report/) a state lawsuit with the goal of kicking Donald Trump off the state’s March 23rd Republican presidential ballot. Presented simply as a Louisiana citizen by establishment news outlets, Ashley Reeb is, in fact, a self-described “neocommunist” and member of St. Bernard Parish Democrat Executive Committee. Reeb’s lawsuit, filed on December 22nd, claims: “Both Trump’s actions (engaging in insurrection) as well as his inaction (giving aid and comfort to insurrectionists) on Jan. 6, 2021, disqualify him from holding any office of/under the United States.” Ms. Reeb’s legal claims echo those dismissed by state supreme courts in [Minnesota](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/11/08/minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-suit-calling-for-trump-to-be-barred-from-ballot/) and [Michigan](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/27/winning-michigan-supreme-court-rejects-trump-ballot-ban-case-brought-by-soros-hamas-linked-group/). According to her LinkedIn [profile,](https://archive.ph/W1Szd) Ms. Reeb works as seasonal staff with the The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Foundation, Inc. From 1999 to 2005 she served as a part-time Administrative File Clerk with the Louisiana National Guard, and as a Deputy with the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff’s Office from 2001 to 2003. An examination of Ms. Reeb’s social media [account](https://twitter.com/DatParishGirl) on X (formerly Twitter) reveals she is a follower and reposter of a whose-who of ‘ResistanceLib’ accounts. Reeb herself has [pushed](https://archive.ph/UVb6e) the debunked Russiagate conspiracy theory as recently as August 21st, 2023. In addition, she has [posted](https://www.facebook.com/ashleybreeb/posts/pfbid0FNzKaLSQz4Q81EghpNJWm5cLqbH5aaCzYFFZ5TJpKVwE1YneRg7Lo2E3E5yyFUqul) pro-Hamas propaganda on her Facebook page, claiming Israeli hostages were well treated by their Hamas terrorist captors and even ‘thanked’ them – with additional claims it is Israelis who have engaged in mass kidnappings of Palestinians. According to local [reports](https://thehayride.com/2023/12/meet-the-insane-chalmette-leftist-suing-to-keep-trump-off-the-louisiana-ballot/), Ms. Reeb flies both a transgender flag and a Black Lives Matter flag outside her home. \"They KNOW he is a fucking prolific criminal, and they are mostly too chickenshit to call him out for it.\" Simple answer: Russian kompromat. The RNC was hacked when the DNC was. Interestingly, that's about the time when they all fell in line 🤔 [https://t.co/JzuktoEQag] — Ash (@DatParishGirl) [August 21, 2023]",

    "title": "Good Friday Pilgrimage Draws Hundreds to Mount Jumullong-Manglo Amid Local Infrastructure Debates",
    "text": "On March 29, 2024, hundreds of residents embarked on a spiritual journey up Mount Jumullong-Manglo to observe Good Friday, reflecting a community's faith amidst ongoing local infrastructure discussions. This annual pilgrimage, deeply rooted in the island's traditions, coincides with significant developments in Guam's utility sector, highlighting a community at the crossroads of tradition and modernization.\nAdvertisment Tradition Meets Transformation The ascent of Mount Jumullong-Manglo, a revered tradition for many on the island, serves not only as a physical challenge but as a manifestation of faith and reflection. As participants reached the summit, their journey underscored the broader narrative of an island grappling with infrastructural and environmental changes. Concurrently, the Consolidated Commission on Utilities has approved crucial amendments to the energy conversion agreement with Guam Ukudu Power LLC, aimed at reducing costs by $57.3 million while addressing additional claims and acceleration costs totaling $17 million. This adjustment is part of a broader strategy to meet the island's power needs, with the Public Utilities Commission set to review these changes, including a temporary power contract with Aggreko.\nCommunity at a Crossroads Advertisment The Good Friday pilgrimage occurs against a backdrop of significant infrastructural developments, notably the ongoing construction of the Ukudu Power Plant. This project represents a pivotal moment for Guam's energy sector, promising to address longstanding power generation and reliability concerns. However, it also sparks dialogue about the balance between progress and preservation, as the island navigates the complexities of modernization while holding onto its cultural and spiritual heritage. The adjustments to the Ukudu agreement, reducing costs and addressing acceleration, reflect a pragmatic approach to these challenges, aiming to secure a stable power future without undue financial burden on the community.\nReflections on Faith and Future The juxtaposition of the Good Friday pilgrimage with the island's infrastructural debates offers a unique lens through which to view the community's values and aspirations. As residents trekked up Mount Jumullong-Manglo, they not only participated in a time-honored tradition but also symbolized the broader journey of an island at a pivotal point in its history. The ongoing discussions and decisions surrounding the Ukudu Power Plant and related utility amendments are more than just bureaucratic maneuvers; they are steps towards a future that honors both Guam's heritage and its potential for growth.\nThe Good Friday pilgrimage to Mount Jumullong-Manglo and the concurrent infrastructural developments on Guam encapsulate a community navigating the delicate balance between tradition and progress. As the island moves forward with its plans for the Ukudu Power Plant, it carries with it the spirit of reflection and resilience demonstrated by those who climb the mountain each year. This moment in Guam's history is a testament to the power of faith, community, and thoughtful leadership in shaping a future that respects the past while embracing the changes necessary for sustainable development.",

    "text": "Football Les Girondins de Bordeaux renoncent à leur statut professionnel Le club bordelais, relégué mardi en National, a annoncé jeudi qu'il préférait renoncer à son statut professionnel pour éviter des sanctions supplémentaires. Les jours se suivent et se ressemblent aux Girondins de Bordeaux. Le club au Scapulaire, [rétrogadé en National](/sport/2024/07/23/l2-bordeaux-renonce-a-son-appel-et-retrograde-administrativement-en-national), a renoncé jeudi au statut professionnel obtenu en 1937. Une décision aux « conséquences funestes », selon le maire de la ville [Pierre Hurmic](/p/pierre-hurmic), qui déplore notamment la fermeture du centre de formation. Dans un communiqué publié jeudi soir, le club, qui avait terminé 12e de Ligue 2 mais a été sanctionné pour ses errements financiers, indique avoir « déposé le bilan » mardi auprès du Tribunal de commerce « afin d'entamer la restructuration nécessaire », ce qui aura pour conséquence « très prochainement » « l'ouverture d'une procédure collective qui entraînera automatiquement la perte du statut professionnel du club ». La crainte de « sanctions supplémentaires » La saison de National débutant mi-août, le club a préféré « renoncer à demander le maintien de son statut professionnel faute de quoi il aurait dû se présenter à nouveau devant la DNCG (Direction nationale du contrôle de gestion) avec un budget ne correspondant pas à (s)a réalité à venir (...), ce qui aurait pu le conduire à des sanctions supplémentaires lourdes ». Cet « effort de transparence » sur « la situation réelle du club » « doit notamment permettre de limiter les conséquences sportives de cette situation », poursuivent les Girondins qui ont « pour objectif d'évoluer en National 1 la saison prochaine, pour permettre, au plus vite, le retour du Club, avec des finances assainies et une ambition renouvelée, au plus haut niveau ». Le maire de Bordeaux en colère L'équipe sextuple championne de France pouvait pourtant espérer conserver le statut professionnel, et donc son centre de formation, si elle était autorisée à repartir en National, division hybride mêlant clubs pros et amateurs. Mais sa direction, qui espère que le tribunal de commerce privilégiera le redressement judiciaire à une liquidation pure et simple, a semble-t-il préféré faire table rase des contrats en vigueur en raison des difficultés du club, qui cherchait 40 millions d'euros pour assainir ses comptes et boucler son budget 2024-2025 en Ligue 2. « J'apprends avec consternation la décision soudaine autant que personnelle de Gérard Lopez, a cinglé Pierre Hurmic dans une déclaration transmise à l'AFP. Elle confirme des choix de gestion hasardeux qui ont amené en trois saisons notre club qui évoluait dans l'élite de la L1 au niveau amateur. » La fin de 87 ans chez les professionnels « L'abandon du statut professionnel aura des conséquences funestes avec, en premier lieu, la disparition du centre de formation », ajoute le maire écologiste, qui affirme « que d'autres options étaient et seraient encore possibles pour sauver le club ». « Si la gouvernance actuelle n'a plus le ressort, les moyens, l'envie de défendre avec énergie la survie de notre club centenaire, patrimoine commun de notre territoire, alors, elle doit en tirer toutes les conséquences », conclut-il. Cet abandon de statut met un terme à 87 années d'appartenance du FC Girondins de Bordeaux au football professionnel français et liquide son très réputé centre de formation, où ont notamment été formés les internationaux français actuels [Jules Koundé](/p/jules-kounde) (FC Barcelone) et [Aurélien Tchouaméni](/p/aurelien-tchouameni) (Real Madrid). Se pose également la question de l'avenir du personnel administratif (90 salariés).",

    "text": "Anzeige\nDer Vatikan spricht von einer schweren Bronchitis. Laut Medien war der Zustand des Papstes vor der Einlieferung beunruhigend.\nDer Gesundheitszustand von Papst Franziskus in den Tagen vor seiner Einlieferung in die römische Gemelli-Klinik am Freitagvormittag war nach einem italienischen Medienbericht besorgniserregend. Die römische Tageszeitung „Il Messaggero“ berichtete am Sonntag unter Berufung auf eine anonyme Quelle in seinem Umfeld, alle klinischen Werte seien außerhalb der Norm gewesen.\nAuch eine mehrfache Verabreichung von Cortison habe nicht mehr die gewünschte Wirkung gezeigt. Weiter heißt es in dem Bericht, es habe die Gefahr bestanden, dass die jahreszeitlich bedingte Erkrankung chronisch werde und in eine lebensgefährliche Lungenentzündung umschlage.\nVatikan hält sich bedeckt\nDer Vatikan veröffentlicht seit Freitag in unregelmäßigen Abständen knappe Mitteilungen über den Zustand des Papstes und seine medizinische Behandlung. Es handelt sich dabei jedoch nicht um ärztliche Bulletins aus der Gemelli-Klinik mit genauen Daten, sondern um redigierte Textfassungen aus dem Vatikan mit eher vagen Angaben.\nSo hieß es in der Mitteilung vom Samstagabend: „Die Therapie wurde aufgrund weiterer mikrobiologischer Befunde leicht verändert. Einige der heutigen Laborwerte haben sich verbessert.“\nVatikan ruft Gläubige zum Gebet auf\nUnterdessen wird unter Vatikanmitarbeitern darüber spekuliert, ob der dichte Terminplan des Heiligen Jahres mit zahlreichen Auftritten des Papstes beibehalten werden kann oder mit Rücksicht auf die angeschlagene Gesundheit des Kirchenoberhaupts modifiziert werden muss. Am Sonntag verlas der für Kultur und Bildung zuständige Kurienkardinal José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça im Petersdom eine Predigt des Papstes. Zu Beginn des Gottesdienstes rief er die Teilnehmer zum Gebet für die Genesung des Papstes auf.\nAnlass war die Heiligjahrfeier der Künstler und Kulturschaffenden. Am Vortag war die Begegnung der Heiligjahrpilger mit dem Papst ersatzlos gestrichen worden. Zum Sonntagmittags-Gebet ließ der Papst eine schriftliche Grußbotschaft an die Pilger verbreiten und sein für Montag geplanter Besuch in den römischen Filmstudios „Cinecittá“ wurde abgesagt.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](https://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
