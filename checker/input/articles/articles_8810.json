    "text": "[Politics](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/category/politics/) Congressional Committee Strips Marijuana Banking Protections From Key Spending Bill A GOP-controlled House committee has voted to strip marijuana banking protections from a large-scale spending bill. While the legislation as introduced and approved by a subcommittee included language to prevent certain federal regulators from penalizing financial institutions simply for working with state-legal cannabis businesses, that was removed on Thursday by the full House Appropriations Committee. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-OH)—co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, lead sponsor of standalone bipartisan marijuana banking legislation and the chairman of the relevant subcommittee—had secured the banking language in the base bill prior to its removal. But the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved a GOP en bloc amendment to the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) legislation that included a provision to eliminate that section from the bill. “With over 40 states enacting some degree of cannabis reform, it is past time that the federal government respect the will of these states,” Joyce said in a statement on Thursday. “This issue is especially pertinent as cannabis regulations have been proven to increase public safety and quality of life for Americans.” “My Financial Services and General Government bill included provisions to do just that and ensure states’ rights to make the best choices for their unique constituencies are protected. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have taken issue with these public safety measures,” he said. “While the provisions maintain strong bipartisan support, as chairman, I will work to alleviate their concerns but will not delay my responsibility to fund the government and therefore my legislation in the meantime,” Joyce said. “However, let me be clear, I will not abandon this effort in Congress and will continue to work with my colleagues in good faith to ensure they become law.” Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) spoke out against the en bloc amendment, taking aim at the removal of the marijuana banking protections. He said he “strongly” supports the provision, noting that the full House has passed standalone cannabis banking legislation “pretty handily” on several occasions. “That provision allows people to not have to hide their money that they earn legally in the mattress, and can avail themselves of the facilities of federal banks,” Hoyer said. Joyce said he “truly” appreciates Hoyer’s support for the reform, but said it “was withdrawn from this bill, and we’ll hope to exercise this on the floor at some time in the near future.” “I can’t wait for the opportunity,” Hoyer replied. The text of the cannabis banking provision, which [advanced out of the House Appropriations FSGG Subcommittee](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-congressional-committee-removes-d-c-marijuana-sales-ban-and-adds-cannabis-banking-protections-in-key-spending-bill/) earlier this month, read: SEC. 134. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, a producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling hemp, hemp-derived cannabinoid products, other hemp-derived cannabinoid products, marijuana, marijuana products, or marijuana proceeds, and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian Tribe. In this section, the term ‘‘State’’ means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States. Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC) said last week that was was “overwhelmingly concerned” with the cannabis banking section, and [he threatened to file an amendment to strip the language.](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-congressman-will-attempt-to-remove-marijuana-banking-protections-from-spending-bill-due-to-overwhelming-concerns/) Joyce told Marijuana Moment last week that “forcing cannabis businesses to operate in all cash is a magnet for violent crime,” adding that his legislation before being revised “remedies these issues by further safeguarding the safe, adult use of cannabis and increasing the safety of cannabis businesses and their employees.” Meanwhile, the FSGG spending legislation as introduced still omits a longstanding rider from prohibitionist Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) that’s blocked D.C. from using its local tax dollars to legalize recreational marijuana sales. The same appropriations subcommittee under Democratic control [similarly omitted the D.C. cannabis sales ban and included the banking section](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/house-committee-approves-marijuana-protections-for-banking-and-d-c/) in a spending bill for fiscal year 2022, but it did not make it into the final package.

    "text": "Comparte en Twitter Constanza Martínez, delegada presidencial de la Región Metropolitana respondió a las críticas que surgieron por parte del arzobispo de Santiago, Fernando Chomalí, quien respondió un antiguo tuit de la autoridad, en el que aludía a “quemar la Iglesia”.\n“Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet”, fue la frase de Martínez. Frente a lo cual el religioso -cinco años después de la publicación original- respondió: “Dios la bendiga, Constanza”.\nLa delegada asistió este viernes a la actividad de lanzamiento del plan Verano Seguro, donde fue consultada por la interpelación: “Vengo de un ambiente que también es de mucho respeto a las distintas creencias y creo que mis hechos ya han dado cuenta de eso. Un tuit respecto a una canción me parece que no representa lo que he hecho ni lo que soy”.\n“Este es un tuit bien antiguo, de hace 5 años, lo había hablado cuando asumí el cargo hace más de 2 años”, dijo. Y explicó que “hace alusión a una canción de un artista nacional que se llama Alex Andwanter, de una canción que se llama ‘siempre es viernes en mi corazón’, que recomiendo mucho que la escuchen”.\nLa canción “tiene una crítica importante a la política, al congreso y también a las instituciones eclesiásticas respecto al trato que se le ha dado a la población homosexual y de las disidencias sexuales. Por lo tanto, primero, una invitación a todos a que puedan escuchar esa canción. Eso fue en el día en que se declaró inconstitucional la ley que prohibía el lucro en las universidades y en la educación en general, una demanda que varios de nosotros hemos peleado a lo largo de nuestra historia política”.\nLa autoridad fue enfática en señalar que “si ustedes revisan mi experiencia política, lo que he hecho en estos dos años, pero también lo que he hecho en mi experiencia política como dirigente estudiantil, es siempre velar por las manifestaciones pacíficas. Lo he demostrado, he demostrado que no creo en el camino de la violencia y además, tengo un profundo respeto por todas las creencias”.\nLos hechos\nEl recientemente asumido Arzobispo de Santiago,\nFernando Chomalí, respondió a una antigua publicación de la actual delegada presidencial de la Región Metropolitana, Constanza Martínez.\nEl texto de la ahora autoridad corresponde a 2018, donde alude a quemar la Iglesia y la actual Constitución.\n“Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet #TC #lucro”, señaló la abogada y exdirigenta estudiantil en dicha oportunidad.\nCinco años después y el pasado lunes, el actual Arzobispo de Santiago le respondió: “Dios la bendiga, Constanza”.",

    "text": "Mitsubishi Australia has confirmed it will be introducing an “all-new next generation” 2021 Outlander next year, following the launch of a revised Eclipse Cross later this year.\nThe Outlander has been around now in essentially the same form since 2012, with an update applied in 2018. In other words, it’s about time for a new one. Mitsubishi hasn’t provided any imagery on the next-generation model as yet but today it has confirmed some juicy details.\nIt says the new model will be bigger than the current model, showcasing a bolder design. The company also promises it will be the quietest and best-equipped Mitsubishi ever sold in Australia. That’s obviously a very big claim but the current crop of vehicles aren’t exactly known for their quietness.\nThis, to us, suggests electrification will be a prominent aspect of the lineup. Mitsubishi was one of the first carmakers to offer a mid-size SUV with hybrid technology. Since then Toyota has dominated the market with its latest RAV4, which is available with hybrid power across the range. Mitsubishi might do this with the next Outlander.\nNo doubt a tough market segment to crack, the company says the new model will be “loaded with technology” while boasting “significant interior refinements”. It says it will be a “game-changing vehicle” that shows off a completely new design inside and out. It’s expected to take styling inspiration from the Engelberg Tourer concept from 2019 (pictured).\nAs for the new Eclipse Cross, it’s set to receive its first proper update later this year since it debuted in 2018. Mitsubishi Australia says the new model will showcase a “major” front and rear design facelift, infusing the company’s latest styling philosophy. A revised interior is also confirmed, along with a new touch-screen infotainment system.\nThe Eclipse Cross has been quite a popular model in the ‘Small below $40,000 SUV’ vehicle class. Sales this year are obviously impacted by coronavirus, but during all of 2019 Mitsubishi sold 6998 units in the country. That was enough for eighth spot in the very filling class. Market entry for the new model is penned in for the fourth quarter of this year.",

    "text": "PATNA: Signs of deep fissures appeared Thursday between JD(U) and its partners in Bihar, triggering concerns about the stability of the 17-month-old, six-party Grand Alliance government amid CM Nitish Kumar dropping hints about rejoining NDA led by BJP, a former ally he dumped in Aug 2022.Nitish is likely to share the stage with PM Modi at a function to be held at Sugauli in Bihar's East Champaran district on Feb 4, sources said.107156678The discord within the Grand Alliance was visible Thursday after RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya made veiled comments against CM Nitish for \\\"changing his ideology as the wind changes its direction\\\". Rohini posted at least three comments, indirectly criticising the CM for his remarks on \\\"parties promoting family members in politics\\\". She later deleted her posts.RJD distanced itself and claimed her remarks were directed at PM Modi. Senior JD(U) leaders, including ministers Vijay Kumar Choudhary and Sanjay Jha, attended a meeting in the CM's home later in the evening and assured that all was well within the Mahagathbandhan.",

    "text": "Here we go again! The New Year brings a sense that all things are possible…sort of. As we consider New Year’s resolutions our mind’s inevitably return to previous years’ efforts, and all too often, failures. But for grandparents that need not be the case—if we set our goals based on measurable, specific, and attainable goals. I refer to these as “Grand-Resolutions.”\nFor faithful Catholic grandparents, our first priority is obviously the spiritual realm. Not that there is anything wrong with setting resolutions in the financial, dietary, or other areas of life, but as an “Intentional Catholic Grandparent” it would seem that our spiritual foundational resolutions should come first. And be, well, intentional to focus on God and our relationship with each person of the Trinity.\nA good beginning might be to consider that any resolutions we make might best be oriented toward Christ. That is, resolutions that glorify Him and are ordered to His will rather than just to our external benefit. Consider goals that will bring you closer to God, find ways to call upon the Holy Spirit more, as well as building your character of charity, or benefit others.\nA great place to begin is to ask Jesus what HE might have in mind for you to do with regards to your role as a grandparent for this New Year. Consider how any resolutions you might make deepen your relationship with Christ, your neighbor, and that of your grandchildren. Resolutions should be thought of as the effort to establish a new habit (in Catholic teaching such habits are called virtues). Not just wishes but, rather, actions that when integrated into your life build your to better conforming to Christ and a life of charity.\nVirtuous living is a primary witness to our adult children and grandchildren.\nHere are six questions to consider when establishing resolutions:\n- How is my devotional life?\nAs a Catholic grandparent we might do a bit of an examination of conscience about the amount and quality of time we send in devotional practices such as reading the scriptures, prayer, adoration, and spiritual reading. At first, as is the case in reading the scriptures, beginning with things like…\n- Pray or Read the Bible 10 minutes per day\n- Read a Spiritual Book rather than a secular one\n- Visit Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament or sign up for Adoration for 1 hr. per week specifically dedicated to pray for your children and grandchildren\n- Share your faith in some way with your grandchild 1x/wk\n- Join or attend a Catholic bible study or Catholic topic discussion group\n2. How is my sacramental life?\nThe sacraments by their very nature engage us physically and spiritually into the very person of Jesus. As grandparents we engage the sacraments with two thing in mind: 1) they are the means by which sanctifying grace is extended to us for the purpose of conforming our lives more completely to Christ and 2) That we might be a witness to God’s gracious love for us and thereby empowering us to “be Christ” to others-beginning with our family.\nRenewing of our baptismal vows, attending Mass, availing ourselves to make a good Examination of Conscience, and receive the gift of Confession and Absolution in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, etc. all speak volumes to our grandchildren and adult children about our priorities, our recognition of our own challenges, of the importance of our communal relationship with Christ, our fellow Catholics and saints suffering and triumphant.\n- Do a Good Examination of Conscience and share with your grandchildren the benefits of this\n- Decide which grandchild to pray for at Mass\n- Fast one day/month for your grandchildren\n- Is your grandchild old enough to accompany you to Reconciliation? If so, invite your Grandchildren (if they are of age) to join you at Confession with a meal following and you can discuss what the sacrament means to you.\n3. How is my commitment to my neighbor?\nWe all have a wonderful opportunity to witness to our faith in Christ through intentional acts of mercy and kindness. Involving grandchildren or even adult children is a worthwhile new resolution for many of us. Might this New Year be a chance to engage with organizations, groups or ministries and include your grandchildren that seek to make tangible the love of Christ? Consider…\n- Volunteer for a Catholic charity\n- Contribute financially to a new charity or expand your current donations\n- Forgive past grievances and make amends-particularly with estranged friends\n- Help heal any inter-family grievances and make amends\n4. What effort am I making in Family Enrichment?\nNumerous studies have shown that a happy, secure home is the bedrock for grandchildren feeling safe and loved. The New Year is a wonderful time to commit to more involvement with your adult married children as well which helps provide a foundation for your children’s and grandchild’s faithfulness. Consider…\n- Babysitting for your adult child/parent while they go on a date night\n- Babysitting for grown parents while they go to a marriage enrichment event\n- Committing to a weekly meeting to a grandchild each week which rotates\n- Celebrating one grandchild’s birthday at a time – maybe take them out alone to lunch to make them feel special\n- Write a Legacy Letter to each grandchild on their birthday or anytime during the year\n5. What is my Demeanor and Personal Comportment?\nOur words and actions around our children and grandchildren can impact them greatly, even more than we probably realize. Always having true respect for others and a living testimony about believing in the dignity of the human person, and living with a positive attitude, can not only plant a seed of growing stronger bonds with family and friends but can bring joy, peace, and hope, even in difficult times and family situations. Here’s some helpful items to consider…\n- Don’t gossip about others or engage in group negativity\n- Be an encourager and “lifter-upper”, not a “Debbie downer”\n- Try to look at the glass half-full in times of trouble and count your blessings such as your “have’s” rather than your “have-not’s”\n- Catch your adult child or grandchild doing something good and take the time to praise the action\n- Offer up any physical challenges/illnesses for one grandchild/week\nCommit and Write out your Grand Resolutions and Action Plan for 2024!\n- Pray about your commitments. Call upon the Holy Spirit.\n- Commit your effort and write them down! Post them on your mirror or somewhere you will see them daily.\n- Don’t do it alone. Find someone to help keep you accountable.\nWishing you a “Grand” New Year!\nPhoto by\nAnnie Spratt on Unsplash",

    "text": "Cruzeirenses foram flagrados invadindo outros setores do Mineirão antes da partida entre Cruzeiro e Boca Juniors, pelas oitavas de final da Copa Sul-Americana. A reportagem de O Tempo Sports registrou o momento em que vários torcedores pularam as barreiras que separam os setores superiores do Gigante da Pampulha. O duelo entre as equipes inicia às 21h30 (horário de Brasília), nesta quinta-feira (22 de agosto). Conforme já informado por O Tempo Sports, o Cruzeiro e o Mineirão estudam estratégias para impedir invasões de setores durante os jogos no estádio. O setor amarelo superior, onde concentram duas das principais organizadas da equipe celeste, é um dos \"mais procurados\" pela torcida cruzeirense. Invasões são registradas em várias partidas da Raposa no Gigante da Pampulha. Na última segunda-feira (19 de agosto), o Cruzeiro apresentou o Código de Conduta para o seu torcedor. O documento cita e exemplifica condutas inadequadas no estádio e prevê sansões em caso de descumprimento das regras. Torcidas organizadas, a partir de agora, devem ser cadastradas junto ao clube. + Leia o Código de Conduta para o torcedor do Cruzeiro O documento explica que o comportamento do torcedor será observado também nos arredores do estádio, dentro e fora dos CTs do clube e de sua sede social.
