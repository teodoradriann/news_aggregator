    "text": "El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, ordenó este jueves una \"acción defensiva\" en el océano Atlántico en respuesta a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a las costas de Guyana, lo que ha disparado nuevamente la tensión entre los países suramericanos por su disputa territorial. \"He ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB) sobre el Caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensivo como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país\", dijo el mandatario. El anuncio lo hizo frente a la cúpula militar, durante una reunión que fue transmitida de manera obligatoria en la radio y televisión, en la que se comunicó con un grupo de efectivos castrenses que concretaron \"la primera fase\" de esta operación, lo que consistió en un despliegue sobre tierra y aguas del estado Sucre (noreste). Maduro no dio detalles sobre el alcance y duración de esta operación pero insistió en que la llegada del HMS Trent británico es una \"amenaza inaceptable\" que supone una \"ruptura\" de los acuerdos que suscribió con su homólogo guyanés, Irfaan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre, cuando se comprometieron a no amenazarse mutuamente y evitar incidentes relacionadas con la disputa. \"Venezuela no se puede quedar de brazos cruzados frente a una amenaza, estamos respondiendo en la medida proporcional\", aseguró tras reiterar que apuesta por la diplomacia y la paz. El líder chavista criticó que Guyana haya desoído las peticiones de Caracas de no aceptar la llegada del barco británico a sus costas. Minutos antes, el Gobierno venezolano había condenado este hecho en un comunicado, en el que pidió a Georgetown \"tomar acciones inmediatas para el retiro del buque y abstenerse de seguir involucrando potencias militares en la controversia\". La disputa escaló después de que Venezuela aprobara el 3 de diciembre, en un referendo unilateral, anexionarse la zona bajo pleito, un área de casi 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados que está bajo control de Guyana y que actualmente discute la Corte Internacional de Justicia.

    "title": "Invasive 'ManhattAnts' Are Taking Over New York City and Spreading Quickly",
    "text": "Invasive ‘ManhattAnts’ Are Taking Over New York City and Spreading Quickly Since appearing on Manhattan in 2011, the species has become one of the island’s most dominant ants, and scientists formally identified it this year It all started on a few road medians on Broadway, at 63rd and 76th streets, in the middle of New York City. In 2011, biologist [Rob Dunn](https://cals.ncsu.edu/applied-ecology/people/rob-dunn/) from North Carolina State was in town to teach classes at Columbia University. During a break, he stepped outside and collected some [ants](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/an-estimated-20-quadrillion-ants-live-on-earth-180980804/). Back in the lab, he looked at them closely and concluded they [didn’t match any of the 13,000 ant species](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nyc-has-its-own-ant-the-manhattant-25741340/) known at the time. At first, it seemed like he might have picked up a totally new species that evolved in the Big Apple. “It’s new to North America, and we believe it’s new to the entire world,” Dunn told the [New York Post’](https://nypost.com/2012/09/02/new-breed-of-ruffi-ant-found-in-manhattan/)s Annie Karni in 2012. With no immediate match to a previously named species, the insect acquired the nickname “ManhattAnt.” Now, more than a decade later, scientists have formally identified the ManhattAnt for the first time. While it’s not a completely new species, it is still a surprising arrival from Europe called Lasius emarginatus, according to a study recently published in the journal [Biological Invasions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-024-03344-z). Researchers had suspected the ants were L. emarginatus, but this paper confirms their identity with 93 to 99 percent certainty. My master's work and first publication on Lasius emarginatus in NYC is officially out in— Samantha Kennett (@smkennett4) [@BioInvasions]today! I'm proud of all the work and collaboration that made this paper possible. ClintPenick [@twpierson] [@RRobDunn]BernardSeifert [https://t.co/cN7RjvKK6O] [May 28, 2024] Since the ManhattAnt’s original Broadway debut, it has seized a place among the city’s most dominant ant species. And there’s no sign it’s slowing down. The ManhattAnt has expanded out of Manhattan and has been spreading at a rate of more than one mile per year into New Jersey and Long Island, per the study. “We predict that they could expand as far north as Maine and as far south as Atlanta, Georgia,” [Clint Penick](https://agriculture.auburn.edu/about/directory/faculty/clint-penick/), a biologist at Auburn University and co-author of the study, tells [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16668/manhattant-ant-introduced-species-new-york-invasive-spread)’s Nell Greenfieldboyce. “This is an ant that could become quite common throughout the East Coast.” Despite its success in Manhattan, L. emarginatus isn’t dominant in any areas in its native Europe, and it isn’t especially known as a species adapted to urban spaces. This makes its New York City takeover even more unexpected. To collect ants for study, researchers suck them up into little tubes like drinking soda from a straw. Back in the lab, they look closely at the physical characteristics of the ants and analyze samples of their DNA to compare with known species. These tests matched the ManhattAnt with L. emarginatus. Besides going out and collecting ants themselves, scientists can learn about the spread of different species through citizen science efforts like [Project ManhattAnt on iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/project-manhattant). This program lets non-scientists report local sightings of the insect. Sometimes those sightings are more dramatic than some New Yorkers might prefer. Unlike many other species of ants in the city, the ManhattAnt likes to climb, walks quickly and is comfortable on relatively smooth surfaces like concrete. So, Katie Guhl was surprised when she came home from a long weekend in May 2022 to find the sixth-floor kitchen she had left spotless covered in a swarm of ants. “There were no crumbs to be had,” Guhl told the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/nyregion/in-nyc-apartments-the-ants-go-marching-up.html)’ Dodai Stewart in 2022. She had never seen ants in her apartment before, but the newly arrived ManhattAnt was willing to make the climb in search of treats. Beyond being an annoyance to high-rise dwellers, the invasive ManhattAnt might pose a serious ecological threat. Some researchers worry about the impact the species could have on the [city’s tree population](https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/57234), which removes 51,000 tons of carbon and 1,100 tons of air pollution each year while saving $17.1 million in residential energy costs. The ants feed on honeydew, a sugary substance secreted by aphids and other pests—and as a result, they form mutually beneficial relationships with these [tree-damaging insects](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-are-hunting-invasive-spotted-lanternflies-and-you-should-too-180980593/), per the paper. It's “entirely possible” that ManhattAnts could hurt trees in the city, the study’s lead author [Samantha Kennett](https://www.drdavecoyle.com/about), an urban ecologist at Clemson University, tells NPR. “I wish we could just see what they were doing all the time.” For now, it seems like the ManhattAnt is living its big city dream—but it might soon be looking to upsize to a nice spot in the suburbs as the species continues to spread.",

    "title": "'The worst possible time of year': Doctors warn about asthma inhaler switch coming in January",
    "text": "Manufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent.\nStarting January 1, a drug that thousands of patients depend on to help them breathe will disappear from pharmacy shelves, and doctors are concerned patients may have delays switching to alternatives and getting them covered by insurance.\nManufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent, and instead is making an \"authorized generic\" version, which is identical but without the same branding.\nPhysicians who treat patients with asthma say the authorized generic will work just as well as the branded drug, but it doesn't appear to be covered as widely by insurers. That may mean patients will have to obtain new prescriptions and sort out coverage hurdles at the height of respiratory virus season.\n\"This medication has been the most commonly used inhaled medication for the past 25 or 30 years,\" said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center. \"It's the one that, overwhelmingly, pediatricians reach for when they decide that their patient needs a daily preventive medication. ... The fact that it's being discontinued is going to be a huge shock to the system for patients, for families and for doctors.\"\nDoctors are urging patients to take action now to ensure they've got their medicine heading into the new year and advocacy groups have been trying to get the word out.\nBut the story of why Flovent is disappearing, and the lack of insurance coverage for its ostensibly identical replacement, touches on some of the most complex facets of American health care and drug pricing.\nA spokeswoman for GSK said the company is making the change \"as part of our commitment to be ambitious for patients.\"\nShe noted the company introduced the authorized generics of Flovent HFA, an inhalation aerosol, and Flovent Diskus, an inhalation powder, in May 2022 and October 2023, and that, subsequently, it would discontinue manufacturing the branded versions in the United States on January 1, 2024.\nThe authorized generics, she said, \"will provide patients in the US with potentially lower cost alternatives of these medically important products.\"\nExperts who follow the industry both on Wall Street and in academia, though, point out GSK is making the switch at precisely the time a change in Medicaid rebates could cause the company to have to pay large penalties because of price increases on Flovent over a number of years.\nThe legal change coming into effect on the first of the year removes a cap on Medicaid rebates that companies are required to pay if they raise the price of medicines more than inflation.\n\"Flovent Diskus has been on the market since 2000 and Flovent HFA since 2004, and GSK has hiked the price on both products numerous times since their launch,\" Dr. William Feldman, an associate physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies asthma drugs, told CNN. \"These are precisely the sort of drugs that will be affected by the new policy eliminating the Medicaid rebate cap.\"\nUntil now, the rebates were capped at the total price of a drug, so manufacturers would never pay more than a drug costs back to Medicaid.\nBut under a provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that limit was removed, and starting January 1, 2024, drugs that have been subject to large price increases over time could end up incurring rebates to Medicaid that are greater than their price - meaning pharmaceutical companies would sell those drugs to Medicaid at a loss.\n\"Obviously pharma doesn't want to be selling at a loss on anything in its portfolio,\" said Andrew Baum, an analyst who covers the stock of GSK and other pharmaceutical companies for the financial firm Citi. \"So it seeks to evade impact by, one: discontinuation; two: authorized generic.\"\nAn authorized generic, Baum told CNN, is viewed as a separate product, \"but still enables pharma to collect some of the economics.\"\nOr, put another way, it's the same product without the branding and also without the history of price increases that would leave the medicine vulnerable to such large rebates to Medicaid.\nAccording to data from GoodRx, the price of branded Flovent has gone up about 47% since 2014.\nOther drugmakers have made changes ahead of the January 1 rebate cap removal as well; makers of insulin this year announced major price cuts - of 70% or more - on their products, a move analysts estimate will save them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\nThe authorized generic strategy GSK is employing \"is a way, broadly speaking, to maximize the profitability of the product in question,\" said David Amsellem, a financial analyst who covers the industry at investment firm Piper Sandler.\nHe noted there are currently no other generic versions of Flovent approved by the FDA.\nGSK did price the authorized generic lower than branded Flovent; one package of Flovent HFA in the 110 microgram dose, for example, costs $273.83, about 50% more than the $177.99 wholesale acquisition cost of its authorized generic counterpart, according to prices the company shared with CNN. The wholesale acquisition cost is the price before insurance and rebates.\nBut CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager that determines which medicines are covered by insurance for its members, is giving preferential placement to another branded inhaler, Pulmicort, on its formulary, instead of the authorized generic versions of Flovent.\n\"In this case, the authorized generics were more expensive than the brand name medications,\" a CVS spokesman told CNN. He noted that's based on net prices, rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, meaning Pulmicort could be less expensive because of rebates its manufacturer, AstraZeneca, pays to obtain better insurance coverage.\nThe fact that insurance plans aren't broadly covering the authorized generic of Flovent, said BMC's Cohen, \"means that patients are going to need to get a brand new prescription for a completely different medication in the middle of the worst possible time of year, which is the winter respiratory virus season.\"\nFor patients with persistent asthma, Cohen said, Flovent has been the most commonly used daily preventive anti-inflammatory medication for decades. It shrinks swelling in the airways and reduces the body's exaggerated response to triggers that make it hard to breathe.\nDuring cold and flu season, she said, it becomes even more crucial to have that daily medicine.\n\"Flu, Covid, RSV - all these circulating viruses that are going around right now - are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, triggers for asthma attacks in kids,\" Cohen said. \"This is what leads to kids being in the emergency room.\"\nCohen said she's concerned that patients, as well as physicians and pharmacists, don't know this change with Flovent is coming, and they need to act now to work out alternatives and determine insurance coverage.\nFor some groups, the alternatives are more limited. For patients with a more rare inflammatory condition, called eosinophilic esophagitis, Flovent HFA is one of the most commonly prescribed topical steroids, and other medicines don't have as much data supporting their use in the condition, said Dr. Erin Syverson, an attending physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Boston Children's Hospital.\nAs EoE affects the esophagus, patients swallow the medicine instead of breathing it in, and it can tame the inflammation that can cause pain with swallowing or food getting stuck, requiring procedures to remove it. In kids, Syverson said, EoE can lead to recurrent vomiting, heartburn, belly aches, and trouble making progress starting solid foods, and Flovent can help keep the condition under control.\n\"With the discontinuation coming up, I worry it's going to just be one more hurdle for this patient population that already has very limited medications available to them,\" Syverson told CNN. \"I don't know what January is going to be like, but I'm worried.\"\nCNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
