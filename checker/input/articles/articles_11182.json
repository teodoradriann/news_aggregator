    "text": "Leading cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicts several significant market corrections, even as Bitcoin BTC/USD trades near record highs at $98,192 .\nWhat Happened : “Bitcoin is going to take liquidity on lower levels,” van de Poppe warned on X, forecasting “4-6 flash crashes” before year-end. These corrections could see Bitcoin drop 5-10% in a single day, while alternative cryptocurrencies might experience even steeper declines of 20-30%.\nHowever, van de Poppe suggests these dramatic drops could present strategic entry points for investors. “After such a flash crash on Bitcoin, that’s the moment where Bitcoin consolidates, and altcoins shoot off,” he explained, describing the market’s rotation pattern.\nDespite Bitcoin’s approach toward $100,000, market sentiment remains notably subdued compared to previous bull runs, suggesting potential volatility ahead as van de Poppe predicts. “Timing those flash crashes is hard, but they do happen,” he cautioned, advising investors to prepare for these market movements.\nFLASH CRASH! What do you mean?\nWell, #Bitcoin is going to take liquidity on lower levels, it will.\nThere will be crashes of 5-10% on a day. #Altcoins might fall 20-30%, which are the days you should activate your entries.\nHowever, after such a flash crash on Bitcoin, that's… pic.twitter.com/DTbIcs4Kob\n— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 21, 2024 See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Prep For Early Thanksgiving: ‘BTC Is Currently (Less Than) One ETH Away From $100,000,’ Says Trader\nWhy It Matters : The warning comes amid a broader cryptocurrency market surge, with total market capitalization reaching $3.3 trillion.

Oklahoma's matchup against Maine has been moved to Noon ET from its original 2:30 p.m., while Oklahoma State's game against Arizona State has been shifted to 3:30 p.m. ET from 7 p.m. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are predicted, prompting officials to prioritize fan and participant safety.\n- Oklahoma's record: 4-4, needs 2 wins in last 4 games for bowl eligibility.\n- Oklahoma State's record: 3-5, currently 0-5 in Big 12 play.\n- The National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for Norman, Oklahoma, from Saturday morning through Monday evening.\n- The Sooners aim to end a three-game losing streak against Maine.\nIf Oklahoma wins against Maine, they can gain confidence heading into tougher matchups against Missouri, Alabama, and LSU. Meanwhile, Oklahoma State will seek a victory to revive their disappointing season as they face Arizona State.\nBottom LineThe schedule adjustments highlight the importance of safety amid severe weather threats, while both Oklahoma teams urgently need victories to improve their dismal season standings and achieve bowl eligibility.\nRead more at CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "eco IT Decision-Maker Survey: AI Is Megatrend 2024",
    "text": "- 73.6 per cent of IT decision-makers see artificial intelligence (AI) as the most influential trend for business IT in 2024\n- eco Association gives 5 recommendations on how companies can benefit from new AI applications in 2024\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the trend that will shape the IT industry the most in 2024, according to approximately three quarters (73.6 per cent) of IT decision-makers. At the start of 2024, the market and opinion research institute Civey conducted an open survey on behalf of the eco – Association of the Internet Industry, asking 352 IT decision-makers about the most important IT trend in 2024. They also named data protection (6.5 per cent) and cloud solutions (3 per cent) as other trend topics.\n“Generative AI such as ChatGPT has arrived in companies in 2023. But the possibilities of AI go far beyond the automated creation of content,” says eco Chair Oliver Süme. “Artificial intelligence (AI) applications along the entire value chain – for example from the cloud and based on AI ecosystems – can strengthen the international competitiveness of any company in 2024.” This is also shown by the current eco Industry Monitor, according to which AI can increase productivity by 0.8-1.4 per cent annually. With LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT, 15 per cent of all work tasks can already be completed faster and with the same quality, and this figure could rise to 56 per cent in the future. “When implementing the AI Act adopted by the EU, the mistakes of the GDPR with its different interpretations at national level must not be repeated and the fundamental possibilities of Code of Conducts now need a strong tailwind from the EU Commission.”\nIn order to realise the productivity potential of AI in 2024 and increase IT security, productivity and competitiveness with AI solutions, the eco Association has 5 recommendations for action:\n1. Rely on AI from the cloud. Cloud-based AI-as-a-service offerings also provide small and medium-sized enterprises with the opportunity of low-threshold access to new AI applications. Hyperscalers in particular, i.e. the very large cloud providers, but also regional cloud providers, have introduced numerous innovations in the past year that will promote the development of AI solutions on a large scale. Conversely, AI will drive cloud usage because massive computing and storage resources are required for the training and tuning of AI models as well as for their application.\n2. Strengthen your IT security with AI applications. AI can detect spam emails in the mailbox or unusual behaviour and data flows within IT faster and more efficiently – and thus warn security managers of attacks at an early stage. This allows companies to initiate countermeasures more quickly. Artificial intelligence also relieves IT teams of routine tasks, which are under great strain due to a shortage of staff and specialists.\n3. Invest in your digital infrastructure. For a lot of AI data, it is important to process it with low latency as close to the point of use as possible. This applies to applications in manufacturing or self-driving cars as well as immersive Internet applications (Web3). However, because potential users are not only located in well-served urban centres, infrastructure providers should also be located wherever data is processed in order to guarantee the necessary low latencies.\n4. Increase employee satisfaction with AI. AI can contribute to the establishment of New Work concepts in order to redesign and reorganise work in the company. AI takes over monotonous routine tasks in particular and automates daily processes. This gives employees more time for creative tasks. Ultimately, AI increases productivity and job satisfaction.\n5. Participate in new AI ecosystems that are currently emerging across companies or even industries. Companies are developing new AI application scenarios and AI ecosystems in the eco initiative “AI in practice”, for example, which also offers assistance with questions relating to data protection and the security of new AI business models.",

    "text": "A 77-year old woman was still in critical condition Thursday evening after being hit by a car on Wednesday night near Town Center. A spokesperson for the Virginia Beach Police Department said she was checking to provide additional updates on the woman, but News 3 has not heard back as of Thursday afternoon. The woman was in a crosswalk at the intersection of Virginia Beach Boulevard and Independence Boulevard, but did not have the right-of-way, the spokesperson said. Just up the road earlier this month, a pedestrian was hit and killed on Virginia Beach Boulevard. The city is working on its local road safety action plan, holding another meeting with the community in February to get more feedback. In interactive comments online, people are weighing in on the traffic in the area, including one person who said there's no efficient way to cross Independence Boulevard outside of the Virginia Beach Boulevard. In addition to the action plan, the city is getting nearly $15 million from the federal government to build a three-mile path from the border of Norfolk to Town Center along what was once land reserved for the light rail. News 3 spoke with people in the area about traffic. \"Pedestrian safety is something they should pay more attention to,\" said one person. \"As long as you follow the signs, the traffic will follow you fine,\" said another. Stay with News 3 as more updates about the crash continue to be made available. More stories from Virginia Beach",

    "text": "KARACHI - Pakistan’s auto industry continued to face challenges in 2023, with car sales dropping by up to 55%. Additionally, production in factories manufacturing car parts was also slashed by 70 per cent. Due to the crisis of exchange rates, car production was severely affected by a decline in income until last year. The reduced car sales not only impacted the national treasury but also led to a noticeable decrease in revenue from products. Chairman All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA), H.M Shahzad in recent interview shed light on the severity of the current situation in the auto sector. Regarding the crisis in the auto industry, Shahzad stated that if the production or assembling of cars in the country continues at the current rate, the next two years will witness even worse conditions. He added that despite agreements with automobile companies, Pakistan has been unable to transfer technology and manufacturing capabilities, resulting in bearing the cost of expensive cars. However, the current government is actively addressing this issue, and important negotiations are underway. It is important to note that following a decrease in the value of US dollar against the Pakistani rupee, automobile companies slashed the prices of the units in the ending months of 2023. The move helped to boost car sales but it was not sufficient.",

Foi uma sessão de surf incrível. Uma hora de heat é o melhor que se pode pedir em condições como estas. Passei os últimos meses no Havai e também em Portugal a preparar-me para isto, só a treinar tubos, e acabou por dar resultado. Agora é manter a forma para o evento principal\", realçou Santiago Graça, através de um comunicado da organização.\nA bateria decisiva foi disputada em ótimas condições de vento e ondulação na praia de Carcavelos, em Cascais, contra João Kopke, e em prova estiveram também hoje João Moreira, Bruno Mendonça, Salvador Vala, António Carvalho, Miguel Kilford e Francisco Mittermayer.\nCom a vitória de Santiago Graça nos 'trials', e de João Guedes na votação aberta ao público, já são conhecidos 15 dos 16 surfistas que vão participar na 11.ª edição do Capítulo Perfeito powered by Billabong, ficando o último lugar reservado a uma \"estrela internacional\", a quem a organização irá dirigir um convite de última hora, segundo critérios de desempenho em ondas tubulares.\nSantiago Graça e João Guedes vão juntar-se aos surfistas já confirmados pela organização, nomeadamente, os oito atletas internacionais, Aritz Aranburu, Balaram Stack, Bruno Santos, Clay Marzo, Craig Anderson, Noa Deane, Noah Beschen e Rob Machado, os quatro surfistas portugueses que receberam convite direto para o evento, João Maria Mendonça, Miguel Blanco, Nic von Rupp e Pedro Boonman, e o campeão do Capítulo Perfeito 2024, Tiago Stock.\nA chamada oficial para a competição pode ser dada até dia 11 de março e em disputa vai estar um prémio monetário global de 50 mil euros.",
