    "title": "Bazooka Charlie's Granville daughter shares WWII heroics in new book",
    "text": "WWII heroics of 'Bazooka Charlie' doubted until Granville daughter sets record straight On a night when Carol Apacki had trouble sleeping, she found herself at the computer typing a search for “Rosie the Rocketer.” That was the name her dad had given his airplane during World War II, and she knew he had done some amazing things with it during the war. The first thing that came up in her search was a very long, technical discussion about whether her father, Maj. Charles Carpenter, actually could have strapped six bazookas onto the wings of his 800-pound reconnaissance plane made of cloth over a frame of welded steel and wood – and used those weapons to take out German tanks. With what little evidence they had and their knowledge of the Piper L-4 Grasshopper’s construction and capabilities, the war enthusiasts cast doubt about whether the stories of his heroics were true. They suggested it was myth at best and perhaps even wartime propaganda. “As for ‘rosie,’ I’m inclined to dismiss it using a highly technical term: ‘Complete Bollocks,’” wrote one skeptic. “During WWII, propaganda, both against the enemy and to bolster the Home Front, was in high gear. Rosie appears to be the result of yet more ‘home-grown hero’ wishes.” The typically mild-mannered and kindly Apacki could feel her face flush. “That made me a little angry,” said Apacki, 81, of Granville, who had plenty of evidence that all of it was true. Her dad, a history teacher before and after the war, was a prolific letter writer, and her mom, Elda, had saved all of his letters and the photos he sent home. So she pulled out box after box of letters, photos and documents and began to school the historians on the true story of a humble soldier and an otherwise quiet family man from Illinois who became known as “Bazooka Charlie.” She shared, with evidence in his own handwriting, that Maj. Carpenter repeatedly flew his military version of a Piper Cub low over enemy troops – who were firing at him with pistols and rifles – and took out German tanks and other armored vehicles by firing missiles at them. “There’s no question he saved countless lives,” Apacki said. The doubters were stunned, and the online conversation caught the eye of Colin Powers of La Pine, Oregon, a retired mechanical engineer and pilot who had restored several planes like the one Apacki’s dad flew. Powers encouraged Apacki to write a story about her dad and offer it to the [ Experimental Aircraft Association](https://www.eaa.org/eaa) Warbirds magazine. It was a small act inspired by respect for her father and her passion for accuracy. It also led to a book and, almost miraculously, the recovery and restoration of the very plane Bazooka Charlie Carpenter flew on his remarkable missions. The plane is now in the [ Collings Foundation’s](https://www.collingsfoundation.org/) [ American Heritage Museum](https://www.americanheritagemuseum.org/aircrafts/piper-l4-grasshopper-rosie-the-rocketer/) in Hudson, Massachusetts. “In 2016, I got a call from a woman named Carol from Ohio,” said James P. Busha, the EAA magazine’s editor and a retired Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police detective lieutenant. “She said she wanted to submit a story about her dad. She said he was a pilot in World War II. “Then she said her father was Charles Carpenter, and she must have thought the phone went dead. I was speechless,” Busha said. “This was a woman talking about her father, but it was a path into history.” After the article appeared, it led to the discovery of her dad’s plane, and Busha contacted Apacki and said, ‘I think there’s a book here.’” During his visit to Granville in 2020 to meet with Apacki and her husband, Ken, Busha said, “I was gobsmacked when I saw all of the letters and documents and diaries.” Apacki’s mother had collected and saved all of it. Apacki was excited that someone wanted to help tell her father’s story, to set the record straight and document his accomplishments. She was thinking it would be a self-published book with enough copies to share with family and friends. “I came back the next day, and she had these lemon cookies for me,” Busha said. “She told me, ‘I thought at first you might be a shyster, but you’re OK.’” Busha and Apacki went on a journey through time and deep into history – including some personal history about the toll the war took on her father, his marriage and his family. Apacki insisted that any book about her dad’s heroics should also include the effects on his mental and physical health – and the home-front heroics of her mother, who stood by him and held their family together during very difficult circumstances. The story was not just about her dad, “but about what can happen to a marriage and a family. It’s many people’s story,” said Apacki, who was born while her father was at war. “I didn’t see my dad until I was 4 – and I didn’t really like him because he was so stern. I’m sure he had (post-traumatic stress disorder).” Some veterans who have read the book or heard Apacki talk about the war’s effects on her dad and her family have been overwhelmed with appreciation for her willingness to be so open. “I had people come up to me in tears – Vietnam veterans – who said, ‘Thank you for telling this story.’” Apacki said the book started as a gift for her family. “I have 13 grandchildren who knew nothing of him. For my family, it has been a wonderful reconnection with their roots.” Her dad grew up as one of six children in a home where his dad drank and gambled so much that he lost the family farm. Adversity led Carpenter as a 17-year-old, to write this personal creed: “I have resolved to exert all of my efforts toward being a nobler and stronger fellow, a gentleman, a scholar, a friend, and a real man. To the best of my ability, I will ever strive to self-control, self-improvement, freedom, wisdom, courage, generosity, truth and true nobility before gods and men. I will be better.” – Charles Marston Carpenter, 1929 Apacki said the creed framed who her father would become, but the war challenged his values. He enlisted after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and by 1944, he was firing missiles at German tanks as U.S. troops swept across Europe. “He was seeing devastation,” she said. “He was brave but not the man he wanted to be. He was a man of peace, and he saw untold deaths and destruction – day after day, endless death and destruction.” In one incredible act of bravery, Carpenter, who had flown over an occupied village, landed near some U.S. troops just outside town and asked why the troops were not moving to rout the few Germans holding it. The troops were under the impression the town was swarming with German troops, so they stayed at bay – until Carpenter jumped onto a U.S. tank, grabbed a 50-caliber machine gun and threatened to use it if they didn’t take the village. His bold move inspired the troops, and they captured the village. He might have been court-martialed for that move if not for Maj. Gen. John Wood, Commander of the 4th Armored Division, who appreciated Carpenter’s moxie and his military skills, particularly his flying. Wood made Carpenter his personal reconnaissance pilot. Apacki said she was stunned when she finally saw the plane she had read so much about. “I couldn’t believe how small it was,” she said. “It looked like a kid’s toy.” Her dad’s letters talked about being shot at by German troops, “and the restorer found bullet holes in the plane.” The Collings Foundation located the plane in a museum in Austria, where it had been used after WWII to pull gliders into the air. The museum operators clearly didn’t know its history and sold it for a song, Busha said. The foundation hired Colin Powers to restore the plane, given his experience rebuilding several Piper L-4s. “I restored it for Collings but also for Carol,” Powers said. When he stripped off the old fabric, he found that “Rosie had bullet holes, and a lot of signatures of the people who built it were on the wooden spars.” It took him a year to restore it, and when it came time to apply the “Rosie the Rocketer” image on the new fabric skin, he invited Apacki’s daughter and Carpenter’s granddaughter to put paintbrush to canvas. Erin Pata is [ a graphic artist](https://www.butterbeanstudios.com/) living in California, and Powers said she nailed the “nose art” on the plane. As he was completing the restoration, Powers made a special request of Apacki. “When I finished the restoration, I asked Carol for a photo of her mom to use as a pin-up in the cockpit,” he said. “Carol sent me a picture of her mom and Carol as a child. It was a very special touch.” At the Experimental Aircraft Association’s annual airshow in Oshkosh in July, an event that drew more than 800,000 enthusiasts over seven days, Apacki was a guest of honor and center of attention. She was invited to center stage to talk about her dad and the book, [ “Bazooka Charlie: The Unbelievable Story of Major Charles Carpenter and Rosie the Rocketer.”](https://schifferbooks.com/products/bazooka-charlie) She was beaming, Busha said, and taken aback by the several hundred people who came to hear her. “I saw the youngest 80-year-old woman I have ever seen in my life,” he said. “You would have thought I was escorting an 18-year-old girl around. She was giddy. She was the star of the show. I introduced her as Charles Carpenter’s daughter, and she was the rock star.” At the largest aviation event in the world, Busha said, everyone knows the name Charles Carpenter, “or the legend of him.” And now they have a book full of facts about the man, the myth, the legend – the humble World War II hero Carol Apacki knew simply as dad.

Gr4yven\nWhich mode has this happened in? Ultimate Team™\nWhich part of the mode? Rivals\nCan you tell us the date (MM/DD/YYYY) that you saw the bug? 1/8/24\nWhat time did you see the bug? (HH:MM AM/PM) 12:00 m\nWhat is your time zone? GMT (UTC)\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? To reproduce the issue, follow these steps on an Xbox Series X: Launch EA SPORTS FC 25 and enter the Division Rivals mode. Connect a second controller and attempt to add a second guest to the match (in addition to the main user and the first guest). You will notice that the game does not allow adding more than one guest. It only recognizes the main player and the first guest, rejecting any attempt to add a second or third guest.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? When the bug occurs, the game does not allow adding a second guest to the Division Rivals match. After connecting a second controller and attempting to add another guest, the option to include more players is unavailable, and the system only recognizes the main user and the first guest.\nWhat should be happening instead? The game should allow adding up to three guests, enabling a total of four players (the main user plus three guests) to participate in Division Rivals matches, as was possible on previous consoles like PlayStation 4.\n‌\nIn both editions of EA FC , 24 and 25 , on Xbox Series X , I have not been able to add a second guest to the matches, something I could easily do on PS4 without any issues.\nIt doesn’t seem fair that Xbox users don’t have access to a feature that is available on other platforms. We are paying the same price for the game and deserve the same quality of experience. I hope this can be resolved soon.",

It’s about more than convicting offenders; it’s about making our roads safer nationally. I want everyone in the UK to feel safe.”\nShe was nominated for the honour for her positive approach, her drive to help others and her total dedication to the community which shine through in everything she does, whether it's supporting families devastated by the loss of a loved one or teaching other officers best practices.\nChief Constable Rachel Bacon, of Durham Constabulary, said: \"This is a thoroughly well-deserved honour for Detective Constable Horner.\n“I am immensely proud of the amazing work that Nat and her colleagues have done to make people safer on our roads and I have no doubt their forward-thinking campaigns have helped to save lives.\n“She exemplifies the very best of Durham Constabulary: a willingness to put victims first and a genuine desire to make a real difference to real people”.\nThe campaigning officer’s own career has also been marked by tragedy. At the age of 16 she joined the police cadets and then joined the police in 2001, moving from a response officer to CID and then roads policing.\nHer unwavering dedication to support victims never faltered and the tragic loss of a close friend and colleague, PC Jonathan Green, in a road collision fuelled her commitment to enhancing support for affected families.\nDC Horner said: “The loss was devastating. It made me realise the vital role we play in supporting those affected by road incidents.

    "text": "In recognition of Alzheimer’s Awareness Month, the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) is reminding residents about the important health connection between their heart and brain.\nResearch shows that the risk factors that affect heart health also affect brain health. DPH’s Take Brain Health to Heart campaign was developed to provide information, tools and resources to encourage steps that will benefit South Carolinians’ cardiovascular and cognitive health. Cognitive health, which is a sign of a healthy brain, refers to a person’s ability to learn, think, understand, and remember clearly.\n“DPH wants to encourage everyone to learn more about the prevention and risk reduction strategies that will keep both your heart and brain healthy,” said Karilyn Tremblay, DPH Injury Prevention and Aging Programs director . “Living in South Carolina gives us many options to get outside and start an exercise plan, enjoy a healthy diet, and meet up with friends. Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s Disease starts now.”\nThe following steps can help support a healthy brain:\nFuel up right and break a sweat!  Participate in physical activity that raises your heart rate and increases your blood flow.

    "text": "Mark Latham is a \"pig\" who would have been sacked from any normal workplace, according to one of the most senior ministers in the NSW government.\nHousing Minister Rose Jackson, who also holds a range of other portfolios including mental health, today told reporters she has long opposed Latham's behaviour.\n\"Mark Latham is a pig,\" she told reporters.\n\"I've been on the record about that for a long time...\n\"This man has attacked Rosie Batty, told her to grieve in private. This man is well known, on the record, multiple times, as a bigot.\n\"He's one of the biggest bigots in the state.\"\nJackson had been questioned about her views on Latham following a string of allegations made against the NSW upper house MP this week, including of\ndomestic abuse against former partner Nathalie Matthews.Latham has strenuously denied the allegations made by Matthews, saying he will fight them in court.\nHe has also defended sending explicit texts from the floor of parliament by saying he's only \"guilty of being a human\".\nYesterday, further accusations of inappropriate behaviour in parliament were levelled against Latham.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported he had\nsecretly taken pictures of female MPs in the upper housebefore sending them to Matthews, while the two were still in their relationship, with disparaging comments about their appearances.\"It's extremely confronting for me to think that in a workplace there's someone who thinks it's acceptable to take photos of you, to share them with derogatory comments,\" Jackson said.\n\"In any other workplace, you'd be shown the door immediately, and rightfully so... I don't like working in a workplace with someone like that.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald also reported claims that\nsex tapes had been allegedly recorded in Latham's Parliament House office.Premier Chris Minns said he believed Latham had breached parliamentary rules and would have been sacked from any other job because of his behaviour.\n\"Even above and beyond the allegations made in the last week, he's been appalling for a long time,\" Minns said.\nThe government is set to explore sanctioning Latham over the allegations, although parliament is highly unlikely to be able to remove him before his current eight-year term in the Legislative Council ends in 2031.\nThe former federal Labor opposition leader is already facing investigation by the powerful privileges committee and a condemnation motion for using parliamentary privilege to reveal confidential medical information about independent Sydney MP Alex Greenwich.\nEarlier this year, Latham was found by the Federal Court to have defamed Greenwich for a defamatory tweet that explicitly described a sex act.\nHe was ordered to pay $140,000 in damages plus a large proportion of Greenwich's legal costs, but is appealing the decision.\n\"His pattern of behaviour is clear, and we have already indicated that we intend to condemn it (in parliament),\" Jackson said.\nSupport is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at",

He fled the area before police arrival, it said.\nHe was \"seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" the release said.\nPolice say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year.\n\"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said.\nPandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 29 December 2023, 10:54 IST)",

    "text": "Da settimane tutti gli osservatori ipotizzano il rischio di un allargamento del conflitto in Medio Oriente, uno scenario che non è mai sembrato così concreto come negli ultimi giorni. Per la prima volta dall’attacco di Hamas del 7 ottobre 2023, tre soldati statunitensi sono stati uccisi e almeno 34 sono rimasti feriti in Giordania in un attacco con i droni attribuito a milizie filoiraniane. Tanto il numero dei morti e dei feriti quanto il bersaglio dell’attacco – anche se Amman ha smentito che l’incursione sia avvenuta sul suo territorio e assicura che l’obiettivo fosse la base statunitense di Al Tanf in Siria – conferiscono a questa nuova escalation una dimensione senza precedenti, in un contesto segnato da tensioni forti su numerosi fronti. La regione è già “infuocata”, perché attualmente sono in corso conflitti di diversa intensità a Gaza, alla frontiera tra Libano e Israele, in Siria, in Iraq, nel mar Rosso e nello Yemen. Né gli Stati Uniti né l’Iran vogliono una guerra su vasta scala, ma da settimane entrambi stanno giocando con il fuoco, rispondendo colpo su colpo, e avvicinandosi sempre di più all’abisso. Per più di dieci anni gli Stati Uniti hanno preferito sottovalutare la minaccia iraniana in Siria, in Iraq, in Libano e nello Yemen, e questa strategia gli si sta ritorcendo contro L’Iran e i suoi alleati hanno subìto diversi affronti negli ultimi mesi, con l’eliminazione di Razi Moussavi (un pilastro dei guardiani della rivoluzione in Siria), l’uccisione di Saleh al Arouri, numero due di Hamas a Beirut, e di molti alti dirigenti del gruppo libanese Hezbollah, che ha perso almeno 171 uomini dall’inizio dei combattimenti tra il partito sciita e Israele. Ma questo non sembra aver scoraggiato in nessun modo l’asse iraniano. O meglio, l’alleanza che fa capo a Teheran sembra soppesare le sue risposte contro Israele – come sta facendo nel sud del Libano – senza risparmiare i colpi contro gli Stati Uniti. Dal 7 ottobre le milizie sciite attive in Siria e in Iraq, così come gli huthi, hanno intensificato gli attacchi contro gli obiettivi di Washington. L’Iran può permettersi di accumulare sconfitte sul campo, purché queste non lo tocchino direttamente, se al tempo stesso ha la sensazione di vincere sul piano strategico. L’incapacità degli Stati Uniti di affermare il proprio potere di deterrenza nei confronti delle milizie alleate di Teheran e la volontà americana di riportare in patria i soldati presenti in Siria e in Iraq sono considerati dalla Repubblica islamica altrettanti segnali di debolezza di cui poter approfittare: sia costringendo Washington a ritirarsi dalla sua “zona d’influenza” (Libano-Siria-Iraq-Yemen) sia spingendola a riconoscere all’Iran, attraverso un accordo diplomatico, il suo status di potenza dominante nella regione. Messa spalle al muro, la Casa Bianca è in una posizione delicata. Le voci più radicali chiedono a Joe Biden di colpire direttamente l’Iran, unico modo secondo loro di riaffermare la capacità deterrente della prima potenza mondiale. Una decisione simile comporterebbe tuttavia la possibilità di un conflitto su vasta scala che il presidente – in cerca di un disimpegno dalla regione – vuole evitare, tanto più all’avvio della campagna elettorale. Colpire l’Iran potrebbe causare un’escalation che non risparmierebbe Washington e i suoi alleati, in particolare Israele. Tuttavia, anche se Biden ha già preannunciato una risposta, lanciarla in Siria o in Iraq significa correre il rischio di non mandare un segnale abbastanza forte da costringere l’asse iraniano a fermare i suoi attacchi. L’amministrazione Biden si trova ad affrontare una scelta che prevede solo cattive opzioni. Questa situazione è frutto di tre fattori: sostegno incondizionato a Israele dall’inizio della guerra a Gaza; l’intervento statunitense in Iraq nel 2003, che ha offerto il paese all’Iran su un piatto d’argento; la volontà decennale di Washington di andarsene dal Medio Oriente, che ha lasciato l’Iran libero di sviluppare una rete di milizie in grado di mettere a ferro e fuoco la regione. Per più di dieci anni gli Stati Uniti hanno preferito sottovalutare la minaccia iraniana in Siria, in Iraq, in Libano e nello Yemen, e questa strategia si sta ritorcendo contro Washington nel momento peggiore. Dopo il 7 ottobre Biden ha voluto considerare Gaza separata dal resto della regione, e questo si sta traducendo in un fallimento su tutta la linea. Se “l’asse della resistenza” sembra voler correre il rischio di uccidere dei soldati statunitensi è perché è convinto che Washington contrattaccherà in Siria e in Iraq. Qualunque altra azione dell’amministrazione Biden sarebbe sorprendente, perché implicherebbe la possibilità di una guerra aperta con l’Iran. Tuttavia Teheran, che sta per dotarsi dell’arma nucleare, ha molto di più da perdere degli Stati Uniti nel caso di un’escalation incontrollabile. Non è detto che le milizie dell’asse iraniano potranno garantire la sopravvivenza del regime in caso di conflitto contro la prima potenza mondiale. ◆ fdl Internazionale pubblica ogni settimana una pagina di lettere.
