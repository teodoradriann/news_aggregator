    "text": "Compact device is an intelligent assistant director that helps solo creators make great videos Shenzhen, China - February 27th, 2025 - With the insatiable demand for timely video content, video creators now need to produce compelling, pro-quality video, on demand, with lightweight equipment, and a small crew – often only one person.\nThis challenge seemed impossible, but ZHIYUN has developed AI that controls smartphone gimbals to help any creator produce professional video that’s ready to broadcast – or even to livestream. The technology produces astounding results for Vlogs, outdoor sports, and live streaming, as well as general video shooting.\nThe rapid growth of the short video, live streaming, and Vlog markets has led to an increasing demand for more efficient and intelligent video creation tools. So, responding to this market demand, ZHIYUN is introducing innovative AI tracking technology to enhance the creation experience and efficiency for content creators.\nAn AI solution that makes professional videos\nAt the core of ZHIYUN’s AI video tech is smart tracking and gesture recognition. This capability allows a smart ZHIYUN gimbal to keep the subject in view, and respond instantly to user demands. The technology is now so sophisticated that the star of the video can also be the director. Whether vlogging solo or capturing action shots, the AI tracker becomes the user’s personal camera operator, ensuring perfect video quality, even when the user is far from the camera.\nThe AI tracking unit installs easily onto popular ZHIYUN gimbals, such as the SMOOTH 5S AI and CINEPEER CQ5 smartphone stabilizers. It only takes a second for users to place the compact AI tracker onto the magnetizing slot on the gimbal phone clamp.\nIntuitive gesture control makes users into directors\nThe AI tracker contains its own independent camera that is dedicated to recognizing gestures, and controlling the gimbal to keep the subject in the shot. The system does not only follow the subject of the video, but frames and focuses the subject perfectly and responsively. This technology allows for automatic target following, without the need to connect to an external app.\nZHIYUN’s AI produces impressive results with barely any effort from the user. But, when users want more control to get a stunning shot, the system also enables user control of the gimbal and camera through simple hand gestures.\nFor example, a simple ‘OK’ signal (circled thumb and forefinger) tells the gimbal and camera to track the user. A raised palm tells it to stop tracking. There are also simple gestures for common requirements, such as following a subject without keeping it in the centre of the frame, or to count down a few seconds before starting filming. These gestures are recognized with either hand.\nFront and back camera AI tracking\nSimply rotate the tracker 180° to switch the camera direction to provide either front camera orrear camera following. The independent tracker will continue to follow and frame the subject, and to respond to hand gestures.\nNo matter what happens, the AI technology will stay glued to the subject, with sophisticated features like re-identification and recovery tracking after re-framing the shot. The result is perfect video without hassle.\nFind out more\nTo purchase AI tracker, please visit: geni.us/pr-AITRACKER\nTo purchase SMOOTH 5S AI, please visit: geni.us/pr-SM5SAI\nTo purchase CINEPEER CQ5, please visit: geni.us/pr-CQ5\nTo purchase from ZHIYUN store, please visit: geni.us/ZHIYUN-Store-PR\nTo purchase from Amazon, please visit: geni.us/AMZ-Store-PR-Sales\nAbout ZHIYUN\nZHIYUN Tech is a pioneer and a world-leader in gimbals and stabilizers and provides exceptional film lighting solutions for everyone from professional filmmakers to amateur video creators.

    "text": "Kubrick’s first feature released in an uncut, 4K restoration When Stanley Kubrick was in his early twenties, he made up his mind to become a filmmaker. With a few scant family donations and some savings of his own, he put together a small crew. He used his imagination to stretch the uses of a few pieces of equipment. For instance, he used a baby carriage for tracking. What financially strapped indie filmmaker hasn’t done that! His cast was very small, and he had a screenplay by Howard Sackler, who, also in his early twenties, was yet to win a Pulitzer Prize for writing The Great White Hope. Neither Sackler nor Kubrick had yet come to their Oscar nods and wins. They were newcomers, veritable kids working on an experimental project. From that beginning—before Kubrick made Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining, came his first feature, Fear and Desire. Fear and Desire, an existential drama with a war theme, didn’t wow audiences when it first was shown in 1953 under the title The Trap, and then The Shape of Fear. Its emphasis on the philosophical nature of war was a turn-off. As was the case with indie productions that were not making money, its distributor, the legendary Joseph Burstyn, cut down the philosophical dialog of the 70-minute version to a 62-minute version. Years later, a surviving print of the full version was uncovered and preserved by the Library of Congress. Kino Lorber has rereleased Fear and Desire on a Blu-ray disc in a 4K Ultra HD restoration. In addition to the cutdown version that has been around over the years, the company has included the rare original full-length film. Kubrick considered his film more as an exercise than a mature piece of work. He wasn’t keen on showing it to audiences. Still, for those who highly regard—even adore, Kubrick’s filmography, Fear and Desire is a must-see! The story is straight-forward. Four presumably American soldiers crash land in a rural area behind enemy lines. They locate an enemy encampment. They capture a lovely young woman and tie her up. They talk about their lives and the impact of fighting a war. The war is unnamed; it’s any war, a generic war. The newly issued disc, also available for streaming on Kino Now, has several worthwhile extras, including commentaries by Eddy Von Mueller and Gary Gerani. Additionally, there are three shorts by Kubrick which even precede Fear and Desire. It doesn’t really matter which version of this first feature is more of a modern audience pleaser. What matters is having an opportunity to study Kubrick’s roots, to investigate his earliest intentions as a filmmaker. Fear and Desire has been available in various forms over the decades. Companies have released it using master material of questionable quality, even colorized it at one point when that appalling practice was in fashion for classic films. With the proper restoration by Kino Lorber, this significant work can be seen in as fine a version as possible. It’s hard to find a film enthusiast these days who isn’t drawn to Stanley Kubrick’s creative genius. This disc is a treat for film lovers and a study tool for budding filmmakers and historians.

    "text": "Aly is 15 years old. He and his family had to flee their home three years ago. They sought refuge in a densely populated settlement for displaced people on the outskirts of Ouahigouya in north-western Burkina Faso. Ever since, Aly has been haunted by his memories and has suffered insomnia and night terrors. We started off by trying traditional medicine and then modern medicine, but with no success,\" explained his father. Then, Aly's mother attended a session on mental health, which was being held in the settlement where they were living, and she decided to sign up for therapy at the ICRC-supported Lazaré medical centre. In 2023, the ICRC observed an increasing number of children traumatized by the violence they had witnessed. In response, we set up a project in Ouahigouya and Dori that allows children to express their emotions through drawing, writing and storytelling. In Ouahigouya, getting psychological support is a real challenge. There is a regional university hospital, but it only treats the most serious cases. When he arrived at the Lazaré medical centre, young Aly didn't say much. \"He was feeling guilty. Some of his friends had been left behind and he had a lot of negative emotions. Our job was to help him untangle those emotions through drawing and writing.\" Over the course of the sessions, Aly managed to verbalize his fears and express his anxieties through his drawings. Gradually, he was able to resume a semblance of a normal life. Now, he has gone back to school and found new friends, and the night terrors that disrupted his sleep have stopped.

    "text": "It was a high stakes playoff basketball game between Floral Park Memorial and West Hempstead High Schools.\nJoe Gaskin, 64 years old, was one of three referees officiating the game. Nearly towards the end of the first quarter, Gaskin suddenly felt out of breath.\n“One of the coaches asked me, 'hey ref, are you feeling okay?' I said I’m having a tough time catching my breath,” recalled Gaskin who has been a referee for 37 years. “I took the ball and then I felt I went down and then I was out.”\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are\n WATCH HERE\nGaskin went into cardiac arrest and collapsed. The game was stopped and many people flew into action, including Wantagh High School Athletic Director Jennifer Keane, who is also an assistant coordinator for the New York State Public High School Athletic Association and was helping to score the game.\n“I jumped up and ran over and could hear him gasping for breaths and starting to turn color,” said Keane who has known Gaskin for twenty years. She was concerned about her friend but her instincts kicked in. As a former athletic trainer, Keane immediately called for an AED.\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP\nKeane cleared the court trying to shield the players from a life-or-death emergency. Many people jumped to help, including Tiffany Vargas of Floral Park. She had brought her children to watch the game to support their school team and she also happens to be a cardiac failure nurse at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Queens.\n“I told my daughter, I have to help. So I ran down to the court,” Vargas told NBC New York, “when I heard them say no pulse, that’s when I immediately started to do chest compressions and called for the AED”\nLong Island news\nFrom North Shore to North Fork to Long Island Sound and the barrier islands, NBC New York covers Long Island news, weather, traffic and more.\nThere were three other parents at the game that came to help Gaskin. A doctor and two nurses. All of them came together to help Gaskin and one administered the AED. All the while Keane was talking to him, trying to comfort him, “I just kept saying Joe, we got you Joe, stay with us Joe. I just kept calling his name talking to him. He came to after one use of the AED.”\nWhen Gaskin opened his eyes, he was confused, but quickly felt better when he saw a familiar face.\n“I looked up and there was my angel Jen,” Gaskin recalled. “And I remember asking her, do I have pants on? She said, I got you, you’re going to be all right.”\nGaskin was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for more than a week. He was shocked to learn the suspected source of his cardiac arrest was a possible parasite. Doctors are still doing tests to pinpoint a cause.\nRecently, Keane, Vargas and the other people who rushed to help Gaskin were honored at a recent dinner. Gaskin was grateful to meet the people who saved him.\n“Those five individuals had no practice but they jumped onto the court not knowing each others names,” he praised. “They executed a perfect game plan and they saved my life and we are joined at the hip for the rest of our lives.”\nVargas who routinely saves the lives of patients at the hospital, said this is the first time she’s ever resuscitated someone outside of work and it has been very meaningful.\n“I was so honored to be able to save his life,” said Vargas. “This was my first time being able to rescue someone in the field and I was so happy that I was able to utilize the training that I’ve been doing for the past 17 years,”\nGaskin is on the mend and looks forward to being able to referee games next years. He also recalls what he told Jen moments after he was saved, “I told her, I’m glad I’m looking at your face and not God because I want to stay here longer, my grandkids are too young.”",

    "title": "Study: Abortion bans lead to 65,000 rape-related pregnancies",
    "text": "Tens of thousands of pregnancies have resulted from rape in states where abortion is not a legal option, researchers estimate in a new [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2814274). In the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers from Planned Parenthood, Resound Research for Reproductive Health and academic institutions across the U.S. used a combination of federal surveys on crime and sexual violence to estimate that there were about 520,000 rapes that led to 64,565 pregnancies in the time since abortion bans have been enacted in 14 states — ranging by state from four to 18 months ago. Other [research](https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WeCountReport_10.16.23.pdf) has found that there have been fewer than 10 abortions each month in states with bans, suggesting that most, if not all, victims were not able to get abortions in the states where they live, even those where the law allows exceptions for rape. People are also reading… “Restricting abortion access to survivors of rape can have particularly devastating consequences,” the medical journal’s editors wrote in a [note](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2814275) about the new research. “Whether these survivors of rape had illegal abortions, received medication abortion through the mail, traveled to other states, or carried the child to birth is unknown.” About 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. says that abortion should be legal in all cases, according to a 2022 [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americans-views-on-whether-and-in-what-circumstances-abortion-should-be-legal/) from Pew Research Center. And a much larger majority — nearly 70% of adults — say abortion should be legal if pregnancy is the result of rape. But experts say — and the new research suggests — that the realities of putting those exceptions into practice are challenging. “Like many exceptions written into abortion bans, an exception for rape victims may appear to be a reasonable solution but in practice can create more trauma and danger for patients who have already experienced a traumatic event,” said Dr. Sami Heywood, an ob/gyn in Illinois and fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health who was not involved in the new research. “No other health care is reserved only for people who can prove a crime took place. That’s not an ethical way to practice medicine. It is cruel to force people who have already been victimized to jump through legal and logistical barriers that cause further harm.” Health care providers may not always ask the question, and victims may not want to disclose this history, but even those who do may face additional challenges, experts say. “Those who become pregnant after rape may take longer to recognize a pregnancy than other pregnant people, and there may be factors related to the trauma response that accounts for this,” said Dr. Rachel Perry, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Irvine. This delay may mean medication abortion — which may be used up to 10 weeks gestation — is not an option, and victims may have to travel particularly long distances to a provider, said Perry, who was not involved in the new study. Also, rape victims often know their assaulter and may live with them. “It may be especially impossible for them to travel out of state to get abortion care. It may be especially dangerous for them to try to order pills online the way that some people are doing,” said Dr. Samuel Dickman, medical director of Planned Parenthood of Montana and lead author of the new research. “It’s an added burden in so many ways.” It’s difficult to measure how often sexual assault occurs, and Dickman acknowledges that the study includes many statistical assumptions. But part of the work is to raise awareness of a stigmatized issue and take an honest look at who may be affected by abortion bans and potential exceptions. “If these numbers feel huge, that’s because they are,” he said. The estimates are “illustrating something that we see every day when working in reproductive health and abortion care but that may be under-appreciated by the broader public — and deliberately so by the kinds of people who implement bans on abortion care.” Idaho is one of five states that have an [exception for rape](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/13/us/idaho-abortion-doctors-drain/index.html) included in laws that otherwise ban abortion, and the new study estimates that there have been 1,436 pregnancies that resulted from rape in the 16 months since that law has been in effect. “There’s exactly zero abortion access in that state,” Dickman said. “If that estimate is too high, what number would be OK? I don’t think any number would be OK there.” ___",

Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, for their deeds follow them.”(Rev. 14:13).\nREAD ALSO FROM\nNIGERIAN TRIBUNE",
