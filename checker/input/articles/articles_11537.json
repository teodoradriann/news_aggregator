In addition, the Biden administration implemented cumbersome policies to reduce fraudulent enrollment and is combating a lawsuit that aims to block immigrants who lack legal residency from buying insurance under the program.\nkAm$@ 72C[ E96 ?F>36C @7 ?6H 2?5 C6EFC?:?8 6?C@==66D FD:?8 k2 9C67lQ9EEAi^^962=E942C6]8@GQm962=E942C6]8@Gk^2m U>52D9j E96 7656C2= >2C<6EA=246 E92E k2 9C67lQ9EEADi^^HHH]<77]@C8^277@C523=6\\42C6\\24E^DE2E6\\:?5:42E@C^DE2E6\\962=E9\\:?DFC2?46\\>2C<6EA=246\\EJA6D^n4FCC6?E%:>67C2>6l_U2>AjD@CE|@56=lTfqTaa4@=x5TaaiTaa{@42E:@?Taa[TaaD@CETaaiTaa2D4TaaTfsQmD6CG6D b` DE2E6Dk^2m U>52D9j :D 36=@H =2DE J62CUCDBF@jD] }6H 6?C@==>6?ED k2 9C67lQ9EEADi^^HHH]4>D]8@G^?6HDC@@>^724E\\D966ED^>2C<6EA=246\\a_ad\\@A6?\\6?C@==>6?E\\A6C:@5\\C6A@CE\\?2E:@?2=\\D?2AD9@E\\_QmH6C6 ;FDE @G6C fb_[___k^2m :? 62C=J s646>36C[ k2 9C67lQ9EEADi^^HHH]4>D]8@G^?6HDC@@>^AC6DD\\C6=62D6D^>@C6\\f\\>:==:@?\\D6=64E65\\277@C523=6\\962=E9\\4@G6C286\\242\\>2C<6EA=246\\DE2CE\\@A6?\\6?C@==>6?E\\A6C:@5Qm4@>A2C65 H:E9 `]d >:==:@?k^2m 2E E96 D2>6 E:>6 =2DE J62C]k^Am\nkAm%@ 8:G6 4@?DF>6CD :? 7656C2= >2C<6EA=246 DE2E6D >@C6 E:>6 E@ 6?C@==[ E96 r6?E6CD 7@C |65:42C6 U2>Aj |65:42:5 $6CG:46D 6IE6?565 E@ s64] `g E96 5625=:?6 E@ D:8?

[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 30-12-2023 22:15 IST | Created: 30-12-2023 22:15 IST - Country: - India Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, praising security forces, said that India is shining in the world because of the sacrifices made by soldiers while safeguarding national borders and expressed his gratitude to the parents of the defenders of the nation. Singh was addressing an event in honour of the Indian Armed Forces organised by the Maruti Veerjawan Trust in Surat. \"To protect their motherland, her integrity and sovereignty, they sacrificed themselves. I bow down to their parents, who had given birth to such brave hearts and all of you.\" \"India today shines in the international world because of the sacrifices made by our soldiers while safeguarding our borders. All the people working in different domains of society are being able to work fearlessly because of our soldiers, who have taken pledges of national security in their hearts and are safeguarding the borders,\" said Rajnath Singh. Further talking about diamonds, Rajnath said, \"When it comes to diamonds, we have a unique identity in the world. Diamonds carved in Surat are in demand all across the world.\" Mentioning the recently inaugurated diamond trade centre by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December, Rajnath said, \"The recent inauguration of the diamond bourse, which is the largest office space in the world, is a proud moment not just for Surat but for the whole nation.\" Talking about Gujarat, the defence minister said, \"I bow to this holy land of Gujarat. Gujarat is the birthplace of poet Narsingh Mehta, who united and strengthened the then society through his devotion and literature.\" \"Gujarat is the birthplace of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who, through his ideals and principles, strengthened the aspiration for justice and freedom in the minds of Indian society. Gujarat is the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who, with his strong determination, saved India from being disintegrated,\" he added further.

    "text": "Fredonia Tops Southwestern For Title\nBig Third Inning Too Much To Overcome\nFREWSBURG — Max Luce entered Wednesday evening’s game in a nearly impossible situation.\nThe Fredonia right-hander came on in relief in the top of the fifth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out against Southwestern.\nAlthough Fredonia had a 9-3 lead, things got tighter after the first two batters Luce faced reached on errors and four more runs crossed the plate.\nBut Luce didn’t flinch. Instead, he induced a groundball for the first out and struck out Southwestern’s No. 3 hitter looking for the second out. Two more singles, including Mason Winchester’s RBI hit, made it 9-8, but Fredonia got out of the inning when Rocco Bongiovanni made a diving stop and threw to first for the final out of the frame.\nLuce made sure that lead held up with three more strikeouts in the top of the sixth inning as Fredonia won their third title in four years, 10-9, over Southwestern in the District 38 Little League 10-12 All-Star Tournament championship game at the Carroll Town Park.\nFredonia jumped on top 9-1 through three innings, including a five-run third.\nRylan Cambria hit an RBI triple and came around to score on an error to open the scoring in the first inning.\nIn the second, Bongiovanni singled and scored; Luce reached on an error and scored; No. 11 hitter Bruno Muscarella hit a two-run single and scored; and Tim Carle hit an RBI single.\nTrailing 5-0 in the top of the third inning, Southwestern’s Beau Beaver singled, stole second, went to third on a passed ball and scored on Elijah Evans’ RBI single.\nBut Fredonia added on in its half of the frame.\nWith two outs, Greyson Whitfield and Brennan Hodkin hit back-to-back singles ahead of Bongiovanni’s RBI single. After a batter was hit by a pitch, Luce drew a bases-loaded walk to force in a run. Theo Conroy capped the scoring with a two-run single to make it 9-1.\nHodkin threw the first four innings for Fredonia, allowing just the one run on two hits and two walks while striking out seven.\nSouthwestern then began its rally in the fifth. Kolton Bouckhuyt and Walker Eggleston walked before Hudson Rapp was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Beaver drew a bases-loaded walk to force in a run and Collin Strong was hit by a pitch to force in another run, which led to Fredonia making a chance to Luce on the mound.\nEvans greeted Luce with a hard-hit ball that got past first base for two runs and Carter Ray’s grounder got past second base for another two runs before Luce stopped the bleeding with just one more run crossing the plate.\nTucker Shoup doubled and scored on another Bongiovanni RBI single in the bottom of the fifth inning to make it 10-8.\nBeaver singled with two outs in the top of the sixth inning and scored on Strong’s RBI double down the left field line, but Luce ended the game with a strikeout to start Fredonia’s celebration.\nDylan Brink and Beaver each had a pair of hits for Southwestern.\nBongiovanni had three hits, two RBIs and two runs scored; Carle had two hits, including a double, and a run scored; and Conroy and Muscarella each drove in a pair of runs for Fredonia.",

    "text": "HLB’s Liver Cancer Drug Listed as First-line Treatment in ESMO Guidelines, \"Strongly Recomm...\n- 등록 2025-02-28 오전 7:57:59\n- 수정 2025-02-28 오전 7:57:59\n[Kim Jin-soo, Edaily Reporter] HLB announced on Feb. 27 that its liver cancer drug, the Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab combination therapy, has been listed as a first-line treatment in the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The guideline strongly recommends prescribing this therapy.\nThe ESMO guideline, published by its hepatology division, provides comprehensive information on cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up management. Alongside the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, it is widely used by physicians worldwide for patient treatment decisions.\nIt is highly unusual for a drug that has not yet received regulatory approval to be recommended for prescription in clinical settings.\nThe latest edition of this guideline, revised for the first time in three years since 2022, highlights Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as the first-ever combination of a VEGFR-TKI angiogenesis inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy. The guideline also includes key clinical data, noting the treatment’s median overall survival (mOS) of 23.8 months, the longest ever recorded in this field.\nThe guideline classifies the clinical evidence supporting Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as “Level of Evidence I,” the highest rating. It strongly recommends this combination as a first-line treatment for liver cancer patients with relatively preserved liver function.\nAdditionally, the guideline also recommends other first-line therapies, including Bevacizumab + Atezolizumab and Durvalumab + Tremelimumab. However, it specifies that patients with a history or risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding undergoing Bevacizumab-based therapy must undergo screening procedures beforehand. This reflects the necessity of conducting endoscopic examinations before prescribing Bevacizumab due to its high risk of causing GI bleeding.\nSince Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab is a combination of an angiogenesis inhibitor and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, similar to Bevacizumab + Atezolizumab, but without the risk of GI bleeding, it is expected to quickly gain market share upon approval as a first-line treatment.\nHan Yong-hae, chief technology officer of HLB Group, stated “With regulatory approval imminent, ESMO’s strong recommendation for Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as a first-line liver cancer treatment signifies that HLB’s therapy has been internationally recognized as a standard treatment. This is a positive signal not only for obtaining EMA and FDA approvals but also for its inclusion in the NCCN guidelines.”\nIt is highly unusual for a drug that has not yet received regulatory approval to be recommended for prescription in clinical settings.\nThe latest edition of this guideline, revised for the first time in three years since 2022, highlights Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as the first-ever combination of a VEGFR-TKI angiogenesis inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy.

    "text": "The Princess of Wales has hailed the “power of nature” in helping “wellbeing” following her cancer diagnosis. Kate Middleton, 42, opened up about her belief in the soothing qualities of the outdoors as she starts to make a return to the spotlight since revealing she was undergoing preventative cancer treatment. The mother-of-three said in a series of Instagram posts on Thursday to mark the opening of new gardens at the Natural History Museum, London: “I am hugely supportive of the Museum’s commitment to create a special space which encourages people of all ages to reconnect with nature and learn more about how we can protect our natural world. “I know the power of nature to support our development and well-being, both by bringing us joy and helping to keep us physically, mentally and spiritually healthy. “I hope these gardens will be inspiring and transformative for the thousands of people who visit.” Princess Kate has taken to Instagram after opening a new garden at the Natural History Museum. Credit: Instagram Princess Kate has taken to Instagram after opening a new garden at the Natural History Museum. Credit: Instagram The post featured footage of Kate’s visit to the museum three years ago – during which she took a tour of the Natural History Museum’s wildlife gardens and met school children. She made her second public appearance of the year on Sunday when she attended Wimbledon to watch the Grand Slam final from the Royal Box. The future Queen was joined by her nine-year-old daughter Princess Charlotte and sister Pippa Middleton, 40, and was greeted with a standing ovation as she headed into the box. Natural History Museum bosses on Thursday opened a free-to-visit outdoor gallery and “living laboratory” to support nature recovery in the face of climate change. Five acres around the building have been transformed into two gardens, named the Nature Discovery Garden and the Evolution Garden. Kate’s first public appearance after revealing her health fight was at the Trooping the Colour in June. She announced in March she has being undergoing preventative cancer treatment, following major abdominal surgery that left her hospitalised at the start of the year.",

    "text": "本报记者 马宇薇\n　　4月23日， 吉林敖东 药业集团股份有限公司（以下简称“吉林敖东”）发布2024年年度报告。报告期内，公司实现营业收入26.11亿元，实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润15.51亿元，资产负债率为11.27%。\n　　2024年，面对医药行业的加速变革，吉林敖东积极应对经济环境及行业政策的变化，坚持“医药+金融+大健康”多轮驱动发展模式，聚焦医药主业，全年围绕“提质增效、夯实基础”稳步推进各项工作。\n　　打造全产业链竞争优势\n　　目前，吉林敖东业务范围涵盖中成药、中药配方颗粒、中药饮片、化学药品等多个领域，并积极拓展保健食品、食品、养殖、种植等相关产业，逐步形成“医药+金融+大健康”多轮驱动的发展模式，持续打造医药全产业链竞争优势。\n　　2024年，吉林敖东以创新驱动为引领，聚焦医药主业全产业链布局，系统推进中医药传承创新发展，通过深化“大品种群+多品种群”营销体系战略，精准培育核心产品、强化渠道管控与资源协同共享，实现医药板块营业收入22.74亿元，展现出强劲发展韧性。\n　　具体来看，中药板块持续发挥支柱效能，以安神补脑液、小儿柴桂退热口服液、血府逐瘀口服液3个核心品种为引擎，带动重点品种协同发力，实现营业收入16.06亿元；化药板块加速创新成果转化，新品种加快销售，实现营业收入2.77亿元；医药商业板块优化终端网络布局，连锁药店批发及零售业务实现营业收入3.91亿元。\n　　吉林敖东相关负责人对《证券日报》记者表示：“依托核心大品种销售势能，公司动态优化品种结构，对重点品种、潜力品种实施精准投入，形成‘过亿单品引领、千万级品种支撑、百万级产品蓄力’的梯队产品矩阵，同步强化基础研究与学术推广双驱动，构建研发转化与市场拓展的营销联动机制，持续夯实传统中药领域竞争优势，为打造现代化医药产业生态奠定坚实基础。”\n　　加速培育新质生产力\n　　“公司通过传承中药文化精髓与现代科技手段的深度融合，不断探索创新路径，构建了‘产学研’深度融合的创新研发体系，在中药配方颗粒领域取得显著成效。”上述吉林敖东相关负责人表示。\n　　截至2024年末，吉林敖东子公司吉林敖东延边药业股份有限公司已获得500个《中药配方颗粒上市备案凭证》，通过技术应用实现从药材到成品的全过程质量控制。\n　　努曼陀罗（丽江）管理咨询合伙企业执行事务合伙人霍虹屹对《证券日报》记者表示：“中药配方颗粒的智能制造，要在‘传统工艺的可控性’与‘现代系统的标准化’之间找到桥梁。一是通过AI识别技术和传感器网络，打造全过程数字化质量溯源系统，提升批次稳定性；二是通过机器学习算法，建立‘原料—配方—工艺—成品’的数学模型，实现‘标准化中求个性化’；三是布局智慧工厂与柔性生产线，通过自动化分拣、 机器人 投料、数字孪生仿真等技术，打造‘快切换、小批量、多品种’的柔性生产体系，实现提质增效。”\n　　围绕科技创新，吉林敖东引入先进科研技术、数字化生产和智能化管理，推动中药制造从传统模式向现代化、智能化转变，同时依托 长白山 优质资源，建立人参、鹿茸GAP基地，延伸中药产业链，积极参与中药材品牌示范基地建设。\n　　在满足持续经营和长远发展的前提下，吉林敖东已经连续17年实施现金分红，上市以来已累计现金分红41.53亿元。2024年，吉林敖东首次启动中期分红，向全体股东每10股派发现金红利2.00元（含税），合计派发现金红利2.39亿元，占2024年半年度合并口径归属于母公司股东净利润的44.50%。\n　　吉林敖东2024年度利润分配预案显示，拟向全体股东每10股派发现金红利3元（含税），预计分派现金3.52亿元。加上已实施的中期利润分配，公司全年拟派发现金股利5.91亿元。此外，2024年度，吉林敖东通过股票回购专用证券账户以现金为对价，采用集中竞价方式实施的股份回购金额为3亿元。这也意味着，吉林敖东2024年度现金分红和股份回购金额总计8.91亿元，占2024年度归属于上市公司股东净利润的57.43%。\n　　上述吉林敖东相关负责人表示，公司将继续坚持“医药+金融+大健康”多轮驱动发展模式，在保持医药主业稳健发展的同时，依托医药制造全产业链优势，以创新驱动培育新质生产力，以新质生产力驱动价值创造，加快产业结构转型升级，提升中药产业现代化水平。",
