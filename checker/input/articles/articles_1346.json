Secondo l'agenzia Nna, due missili guidati lanciati da un drone israeliano hanno colpito una casa nella località di Aita al-Jabal e qui sono morte due persone, compreso un bambino di sette anni. Altre tre erano state uccise in un precedente raid sulla località Tayer Harfa, secondo il bilancio del ministero della Salute. Hezbollah ha confermato la morte di tre combattenti, senza dettagli sulle circostanze. Secondo le forze di sicurezza libanesi, sono stati uccisi nel raid a Tayer Harfa. I militari israeliani hanno reso noto di aver «eliminato una cellula terroristica che si apprestava a lanciare cinque razzi dalla zona di Tayer Harfa» in direzione di Israele. Il movimento sciita guidato da Hasan Nasrallah ha da parte sua rivendicato attacchi contro la base aera sul monte Meron, nel nord di Israele, in \"risposta\" alle operazioni israeliane.\n13:58 | 23 Agosto Idf: missile dal Libano ha colpito la base militare di Miron L'esercito israeliano (Idf) ha confermato che un missile anticarro lanciato dal Libano ha colpito la base aeronautica militare di Miron, non ci sono vittime.\n13:18 | 23 Agosto Media: presenza Onu nel corridoio Filadelfia e dell'Ue a Rafah Secondo il quotidiano del Qatar al Arabi Al Jadid, la proposta aggiornata presentata al Cairo dalla delegazione israeliana include una presenza permanente di un'unità di ispezione dell'Onu lungo l'asse Filadelfia, al confine tra Egitto e Gaza, in diversi punti fissi il cui numero dovrà essere concordato. Il report riferisce che il piano prevede anche la presenza di una delegazione dell'Ue sul versante palestinese del valico di Rafah insieme con i rappresentanti dell'Autorità Palestinese. La proposta non prevede un ritiro immediato delle forze dell'Idf, ma un ritiro graduale, secondo un calendario che verrà stabilito.\n13:17 | 23 Agosto Hezbollah annuncia la morte di due combattenti Il partito sciita filo-iraniano Hezbollah ha annunciato la morte di due combattenti. In due comunicati distinti pubblicati su Telegram, il gruppo islamista ha fatto sapere che Qassem Saleh Harqous e Hassan Wissam Harqous sono stati uccisi «sulla strada per Gerusalemme», espressione utilizzata da Hezbollah per indicare che ritiene Israele responsabile. Secondo il quotidiano libanese francofono si tratterebbe di due dei tre morti provocati dall'attacco delle Forze di difesa israeliane (Idf) che questa mattina ha colpito il villaggio di Tayr Harfa, nel sud del Libano.\n13:11 | 23 Agosto Lufthansa sospende i voli da e per Beirut fino al 30 settembre Lufthansa sospenderà i voli da e per Beirut fino al 30 settembre. I voli per Amman torneranno invece operativi dal 27 agosto. Quelli su Tel Aviv e Teheran sono sospesi fino al 2 settembre.\n13:10 | 23 Agosto Due morti in attacco Idf contro scuola a Deir el Balah Almeno due persone sono state uccise in un attacco delle Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) contro una scuola di Deir el Balah, nella parte centrale della Striscia di Gaza. Lo ha riferito l'emittente panaraba di proprietà qatariota Al Jazeera , precisando che la scuola colpita, vicino all'ospedale dei Martiri di Al Aqsa, era usata come luogo di rifugio dagli sfollati.\n13:08 | 23 Agosto Idf, «Trovati esplosivi in sacchi contrassegnati Unrwa» Le Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) hanno affermato di aver trovato degli esplosivi in sacchi contrassegnati Unrwa (l'Agenzia delle Nazioni Unite per i rifugiati palestinesi) durante la perquisizione di un edificio nei pressi in una scuola nel quartiere Tel Sultan di Rafah, nel sud della Striscia di Gaza. Nel corso dell'operazione, hanno spiegato le forze israeliane, il 50esimo battaglione della Brigata Nahal ha inoltre trovato «armi, giubbotti militari e documenti dell'intelligence nemica». Nella zona di Tel Sultan, le forze appartenenti alla 162ma Divisione delle Idf hanno diretto negli ultimi giorni attacchi aerei «contro terroristi armati e siti terroristici».\n13:07 | 23 Agosto «Hamas vendicherà Haniyeh uccidendo israeliani all'estero» Hamas vuole vendicare l'assassinio del capo politico Ismail Haniye colpendo cittadini israeliani all'estero, come hanno rivelato fonti palestinesi all'emittente Channel 12 . La decisione è stata presa due giorni dopo l'omicidio avvenuto a Teheran, attribuito a Israele ma mai rivendicato, dall'ufficio politico di Hamas. L'identità degli israeliani che potrebbero diventare un bersaglio, turisti o alti funzionari, non è stata specificata. La decisione rappresenta una svolta drammatica poiché finora era una strategia utilizzata da Hezbollah e dall'l'Iran mentre le milizie terroristiche di Gaza non hanno mai operato in questo modo.\n13:03 | 23 Agosto Libano: ministero Sanità, due morti in raid a Ayta el Jabal Un attacco attribuito alle Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) ha provocato due morti, tra cui un bambino di sette anni, ad Ayta el Jabal, nel sud del Libano. Lo ha riferito il ministero della Sanità libanese, aggiungendo che il raid ha preso di mira un veicolo e ha danneggiato un'abitazione.\n13:02 | 23 Agosto Media, «Israele ha presentato nuovo piano su Philadelphi Route» La delegazione di negoziatori israeliani, che ha partecipato ai colloqui al Cairo per un cessate il fuoco a Gaza e il rilascio degli ostaggi trattenuti nella Striscia, è tornata nelle scorse ore in Israele dopo aver aver presentato all'Egitto proposte aggiornate sulla presenza delle forze israeliane (Idf) nelle aree della Philadephi Route, il corridoio tra Egitto e Striscia di Gaza, e del valico di confine di Rafah. Lo riferisce il sito di notizie israeliano Ynet , in riferimento al lavoro della delegazione guidata dai capi di Mossad e Shin Bet, David Barnea e Ronen Bar. Secondo Ynet , domani Hamas dovrebbe ricevere dall'Egitto i testi aggiornati. Il sito, citando fonti anonime, parla di colloqui che si sono svolti in un clima positivo e produttivo e di divergenze ridotte.\n13:01 | 23 Agosto Tre morti in Libano dopo la risposta di Idf a Hezbollah Secondo la tv saudita al Hadad un raid israeliano questa mattina ha provocato tre morti nel sud del Libano. L'Idf ha dichiarato di aver colpito a Tayr Harfa (Libano meridionale) una cellula di operativi di Hezbollah che stava pianificando di lanciare razzi contro Israele. In mattinata diversi razzi sono stati tirati dal Libano verso la zona del Monte Meron, dove si trova una base di controllo del traffico aereo israeliano, Hezbollah ha rivendicato l'attacco. L'Idf non ha segnalato feriti.\n12:59 | 23 Agosto Onu, «A Gaza bimbo di 10 mesi con paralisi da poliomielite» «È molto triste. L'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità (Oms) conferma che a Gaza un bambino di dieci mesi ha sviluppato una paralisi a causa della poliomielite. È il primo caso in più di 25 anni». Così su X Philippe Lazzarini, commissario generale dell'Unrwa dopo le notizie dell'Oms. «La poliomielite non farà distinzioni tra bambini palestinesi e israeliani. Ritardare una pausa umanitaria aumenterà il rischio di diffusione tra i bambini. Non è sufficiente portare i vaccini a Gaza e proteggere la catena del freddo. Per avere un effetto i vaccini devono essere somministrati a ogni bambino sotto i dieci anni. I team medici dell'Unrwa consegneranno i vaccini nelle nostre strutture e attraverso i team mobili. Dall'inizio della guerra, grazie a questi sforzi, l'80% dei bambini di Gaza ha ricevuto vaccini contro diverse malattie infantili. Continueremo». Le parole di Lazzarini arrivano dopo che il direttore generale dell'Oms, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, si è detto «profondamente preoccupato per la notizia che un bambino di dieci mesi, non vaccinato, di Deir al-Balah, è stato confermato positivo alla poliomielite» e ha «sviluppato una paralisi nella parte inferiore della gamba sinistra».\n12:57 | 23 Agosto Arrestati 14 presunti membri dello Stato islamico del Khorasan in quattro province iraniane Le autorità iraniane hanno arrestato 14 presunti membri dello Stato islamico della provincia del Khorasan (Isis-K), ramificazione del gruppo in Afghanistan. Lo ha annunciato il ministero dell'Intelligence della Repubblica islamica, secondo quanto riferito dall'agenzia di stampa iraniana Mehr . Gli arresti sono avvenuti nel corso di una serie di operazioni condotte nelle province di Teheran, Alborz, Fars e Khuzestan. Secondo il dicastero i sospettati erano entrati illegalmente in Iran negli ultimi giorni con l'obiettivo di compiere operazioni terroristiche.\n12:20 | 23 Agosto Libano: «Lbci», tre morti a Tayr Harfa, due affiliati a organizzazione sanitaria Hezbollah L'attacco delle Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) che ha preso di mira il villaggio di Tayr Harfa, nel sud del Libano, ha causato tre morti. Lo ha riferito l'emittente libanese «Lbci», dopo che i media avevano riportato l'uccisione di due persone. Secondo l'emittente, due delle vittime sarebbero due cugini del villaggio di Toura, nel distretto di Tiro, affiliati all'Organizzazione sanitaria islamica, legata al partito sciita filo-iraniano Hezbollah.\n12:20 | 23 Agosto Turchia spinge per riavvicinare Fatah e Hamas La Turchia intensifica gli sforzi per riunificare il fronte politico palestinese e riavvicinare Hamas e Al Fatah. Il viceministro degli Esteri di Ankara, Nuh Yilmaz, ha parlato oggi con Jibril al Rajoub, Segretario generale del comitato centrale di Al Fatah. Al centro del dialogo gli ultimi sviluppi del conflitto in corso a Gaza, ma soprattutto la prospettiva di una normalizzazione dei rapporti tra Hamas, che governa la Striscia, e Fatah, che controlla la Cisgiordania. Una normalizzazione complicata dalla morte di Ismail Haniyeh, ucciso il mese scorso da Israele mentre si trovava a Teheran. Prima della morte di quest'ultimo infatti, il presidente turco Recep Tayyip Erdogan era riuscito a far incontrare lo stesso Haniyeh e il leader di Fatah, Abu Mazen. Quest'ultimo ha parlato la scorsa settimana dinanzi il parlamento di Ankara e ribadito che Gaza «appartiene alla Palestina» e dichiarato che si impegnerà per unificare «il fronte politico e lo Stato palestinese».\n11:37 | 23 Agosto Team Israele consegna proposta aggiornata e lascia Egitto La delegazione negoziale israeliana, guidata da David Barnea del Mossad e Ronen Bar dello Shin Bet, è tornata in Israele dal Cairo dopo aver presentato la sua proposta aggiornata riguardante la presenza dell'IDF ai valichi di Filadelfia e Rafah. Lo ha riferito Ynet, secondo cui Hamas riceverà la proposta aggiornata domani. Fonti vicine al dossier hanno affermato che gli incontri al Cairo si sono svolti in uno spirito positivo e produttivo e che le lacune sono state ridotte per portare ad un vertice efficace e rapido domenica. Il lavoro di predisposizione per l'accordo tra Hamas e Israele sulla tregua a Gaza e il rilascio degli ostaggi sarebbe ora concluso. Nel frattempo i mediatori continuano i preparativi per il vertice di domenica. Al momento non è chiaro se i delegati di Hamas saranno presenti al vertice del Cairo e non è ancora noto se accetterà di negoziare o rifiuterà la nuova proposta. Prima del vertice, è previsto l'arrivo in Egitto del capo della Cia Bill Burns.\n10:45 | 23 Agosto Gallant sente Austin, valutazione su sviluppi situazione Il ministro della Difesa israeliano Yoav Gallant ha parlato durante la notte con il suo omologo americano, il segretario alla Difesa degli Stati Uniti Lloyd Austin. Secondo quanto riferito dal ministero della Difesa, Gallant e Austin «hanno condotto una valutazione congiunta della situazione e si sono scambiati opinioni sugli sviluppi e sulle minacce regionali». La discussione - si legge ancora - «si è concentrata principalmente sulla preparazione congiunta, nonché sul mantenimento della prontezza e dell'interoperabilità delle forze e delle capacità israeliane e statunitensi di fronte alle continue minacce poste dall'Iran e da Hezbollah contro Israele», afferma l'ufficio di Gallant.\n10:45 | 23 Agosto Netanyahu incontra oggi sei ostaggi liberati a novembre Il premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu ha in programma un incontro con sei ostaggi rilasciati lo scorso novembre dopo essere stati fatti prigionieri da Hamas nell'attacco del 7 ottobre in Israele. E' quanto riferisce il giornale israeliano Haaretz, secondo cui l'incontro è previsto per questa mattina nell'ufficio del premier a Gerusalemme.\n10:44 | 23 Agosto Iran, ministro Esteri: dialogo con Ue per «risolvere problemi» Una richiesta di dialogo con l'Unione Europea per «risolvere i problemi» tra le due parti è arrivata dal nuovo ministro degli Esteri iraniano, Abbas Araghchi, in una dichiarazione diffusa al termine di un colloquio telefonico con il capo della diplomazia europea Josep Borrell. «La Repubblica islamica dell'Iran accoglie con favore lo sviluppo delle relazioni con l'Unione europea in un ambiente basato sul rispetto reciproco», ha dichiarato il ministro degli Esteri iraniano Abbas Araghchi. Durante il colloquio con Borrel, Araghchi ha affermato che lo sviluppo delle relazioni richiede «il dialogo per risolvere i problemi tra le due parti e una correzione delle cattive politiche dei Paesi europei». Da parte sua, Borrell ha riferito X di aver discusso con il suo omologo iraniano «le prospettive di un rinnovato impegno su tutte le questioni di reciproco interesse». La dichiarazione del capo della diplomazia di Teheran giunge a poco più di un mese dall'elezione del nuovo presidente iraniano, il riformista Massoud Pezeshkian, che si è detto pronto ad avviare un «dialogo costruttivo» con i Paesi europei, ma li ha criticati per aver rinnegato i loro impegni sulla questione nucleare. Le relazioni tra l'Iran e l'Ue si sono deteriorate negli ultimi anni in seguito alle critiche rivolte al perseguimento da parte di Teheran del suo controverso programma nucleare, al suo sostegno al movimento islamista Hamas in guerra con Israele nella Striscia di Gaza, al suo aiuto all'invasione russa dell'Ucraina e alle «violazioni» dei diritti umani. Araghchi, che ha assunto l'incarico mercoledì, è noto per la sua apertura verso l'Occidente. In qualità di capo negoziatore del team iraniano, ha svolto un ruolo chiave nella conclusione dell'accordo internazionale sul programma nucleare iraniano a Vienna nel 2015, silurato tre anni dopo dalla decisione degli Stati Uniti di ritirarsi da esso. I colloqui per il rilancio dell'accordo sono falliti nell'estate del 2022.\n10:34 | 23 Agosto Onu: sfollato il 90% residenti Gaza per ordine Israele Il 90% dei residenti di Gaza è stato sfollato a causa degli ordini di evacuazione di Israele. Lo dice il coordinatore umanitario delle Nazioni Unite per i territori palestinesi occupati, Muhannad Hadi. Dall'inizio del conflitto in ottobre, gli ordini di evacuazione israeliani a Gaza hanno costretto il 90% dei suoi 2,1 milioni di residenti a spostarsi. Ci sono stati 12 ordini di evacuazione solo ad agosto che hanno costretto circa 250.000 persone a spostarsi ancora una volta, ha affermato il funzionario dell'Onu. «Stanno costringendo le famiglie a fuggire di nuovo, spesso sotto il fuoco nemico e con i pochi averi che possono portare con sé, in un'area sempre più piccola, sovraffollata, inquinata, con servizi limitati e - come il resto di Gaza - insicura», ha aggiunto. «Le persone vengono private dell'accesso ai servizi essenziali per la loro sopravvivenza, tra cui strutture mediche, rifugi, pozzi d'acqua e forniture umanitarie».\n10:02 | 23 Agosto Presidente Anp invita i leader di tutto il mondo a recarsi nella Striscia Il presidente dell'Autorità nazionale palestinese (Anp), Mahmoud Abbas, ha invitato i leader di tutto il mondo a unirsi a lui ed effettuare una visita nella Striscia di Gaza per vedere «gli orrori che il nostro popolo sta sopportando». Lo ha dichiarato ieri il rappresentante permanente della Palestina presso le Nazioni Unite, Riyad Mansour, in una sessione del Consiglio di sicurezza delle Nazioni Unite. Il rappresentante palestinese ha anche invitato i membri del Consiglio di sicurezza dell'Onu a fare pressione affinché il presidente Abbas possa accedere alla Striscia e ad «agire con urgenza per fermare il genocidio e i crimini che vengono commessi contro il nostro popolo». «Un cessate il fuoco deve essere imposto ora, in linea con i termini della risoluzione 2735, senza ulteriori condizioni o richieste che contraddicono lo spirito e il testo della risoluzione e che mirano chiaramente a ostacolare gli sforzi per raggiungere un cessate il fuoco», ha affermato Mansour. Nei giorni scorsi, secondo quanto riferito dai media israeliani, l'Anp aveva presentato una richiesta ufficiale a Israele per permettere al presidente Abbas di visitare presto Gaza.\n09:52 | 23 Agosto Katz: stato palestinese sarebbe base iraniana a Gaza «Uno Stato palestinese significherebbe una base iraniana a Gaza, in Giudea e Samaria». Lo scrive sui social il ministro degli Esteri israeliano, Israel Katz. Secondo Katz, l'Iran e Hamas hanno sfruttato la questione palestinese e come ha fatto in Libano, Yemen, Siria e Iraq, l'Iran continuerà a «minacciare i centri abitati, le rotte aeree, le rotte marittime e i centri economici in Israele».\n09:52 | 23 Agosto Ben Gvir a Gallant: invece di attaccare me attacchi Hezbollah «Invece di attaccarmi su Twitter iniziate ad attaccare Hezbollah in Libano». Così il ministro della Sicurezza Nazionale Itamar Ben Gvir ha risposto al collega della Difesa, Yoav Gallant, che lo aveva accusato di «mettere in pericolo la sicurezza nazionale» con le sue azioni. «Avete promesso di riportare il Libano all'età della pietra, mentre state riportando il nord (di Israele) all'età della pietra», ha aggiunto.\n09:38 | 23 Agosto Libano: sale bilancio di attacco forze Israele a Tayr Harfa, due morti È salito a due il numero dei morti causati da un attacco attribuito alle Forze di difesa di Israele (Idf) che ha colpito il villaggio di Tayr Harfa, nel settore occidentale del Libano meridionale. Lo ha riferito l'agenzia di stampa libanese «Nna» senza precisare l'identità delle vittime.\n09:14 | 23 Agosto Gallant: azioni Ben Gvir mettono a rischio sicurezza nazionale Il ministro della Difesa israeliano Yoav Gallant ha dato il suo appoggio al capo dello Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, che aveva accusato il ministro della Sicurezza nazionale Itamar Ben Gvir di azioni che stanno provocando «danni indescrivibili» a Israele. «Di fronte alle azioni irresponsabili del ministro Ben Gvir che mettono in pericolo la sicurezza nazionale dello Stato di Israele e creano una divisione interna nella nazione, il capo dello Shin Bet e il suo staff stanno svolgendo i loro doveri e mettendo in guardia dalle gravi conseguenze di questi atti», ha scritto Gallant su X.\n09:11 | 23 Agosto Forze israeliane dicono di aver colpito 30 obiettivi in 24 ore A Khan Younis e alla periferia di Deir al-Balah, l'IDF ha affermato che le truppe hanno ucciso dozzine di uomini armati e distrutto numerosi siti appartenenti a gruppi terroristici. Più a sud, a Rafah, soldati israeliani continuano a operare nel quartiere di Tel Sultan, dove riferiscono che le truppe hanno ucciso dozzine di altri operativi nell'ultimo giorno. Nel frattempo, nel Corridoio di Netzarim, nella zona centrale di Gaza, i riservisti avrebbero ucciso un operatore che trasportava esplosivi e colpito una postazione di lancio di razzi.\n09:10 | 23 Agosto Idf: colpita cellula Hezbollah nel Libano meridionale Questa mattina l'Idf ha colpito una cellula di agenti di Hezbollah che stava pianificando di lanciare razzi contro Israele. La cellula - spiega l'esercito che ha anche diffuso un video del raid - era stata individuata dalle truppe della a Tayr Harfa, nel Libano meridionale, e poco dopo è stato effettuato un attacco con i droni.\n07:49 | 23 Agosto Sulle tracce di Sinwar, leader imprendibile: Israele lo bracca, ma è lui a dettare condizioni Lo cercano a Gaza senza dimenticare di puntare le «antenne» al di fuori della Striscia. Yahya Sinwar, la testa di Hamas, è inseguito da una «muta» di spie alle quali è sempre riuscito a sfuggire. Lo braccano ma lui detta le condizioni. Politiche e personali: avrebbe inserito nella trattativa la richiesta di non essere liquidato . Una delle tante notizie sulle quali nessuno può mettere la mano sul fuoco e che raccontano di una caccia estenuante ripartita dopo l’assalto dei guerriglieri.\n​\n​Ottobre. Gli israeliani creano l’unità speciale interforze Nili incaricata di scovare ed eliminare i capi nemici . Ha carta bianca, può usare ogni mezzo, dal veleno al missile, dispone di fondi per corrompere in un «mercato» dove c’è sempre qualcuno pronto a vendere. Sul leader c’è una taglia di 400 mila dollari , 300 mila sul fratello Mohammed, figura chiave delle Brigate al Qassam. L’intelligence è consapevole che sarà una missione difficile, l’avversario si è preparato da tempo, anche mentalmente dopo anni di galera.\n​\n​Leggi qui l'articolo completo.\n06:48 | 23 Agosto 06:26 | 23 Agosto Gaza: «Axios», Usa partecipano a discussioni al Cairo su sicurezza confine con l'Egitto Rappresentanti di Israele, Egitto e Stati Uniti hanno preso parte a colloqui al Cairo per giungere a un accordo sulla garanzia della sicurezza al confine tra Egitto e Striscia di Gaza, e giungere così alla riapertura del valico di frontiera di Rafah. Lo ha riferito il sito d'informazione «Axios», citando funzionari statunitensi e israeliani anonimi a conoscenza dei colloqui. I colloqui toccano un nodo cruciale per giungere a un cessate il fuoco a Gaza, dopo dieci mesi di combattimenti costati la vita a oltre 40mila persone: come ricorda «Axios», infatti, la richiesta del premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu di mantenere il presidio militare israeliano sul cosiddetto corridoio di Philadelphia, al confine tra Gaza ed Egitto, è una delle ultime questioni che si frappongono a un accordo per la cessazione delle ostilità nell'enclave palestinese. Il presidente degli Stati Uniti, Joe Biden, ha sentito Netanyahu al telefono mercoledì, avvertendolo che Washington si aspetta da Gerusalemme maggior flessibilità per la rimozione degli ultimi ostacoli al raggiungimento di un accordo con l'organizzazione islamista palestinese Hamas.\n06:23 | 23 Agosto Israele: Ben Gvir chiede le dimissioni del capo dello Shin Bet Il ministro della Sicurezza nazionale israeliano Itamar Ben Gvir ha chiesto durante una riunione del gabinetto di sicurezza il licenziamento del capo dello Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. Lo riportano i media dello Stato ebraico. Poco prima l'emittente israeliana Channel 12 aveva pubblicato una lettera di Bar in cui il direttore dell'agenzia per la sicurezza criticava Ben Gvir e le violenze dei coloni israeliani in Cisgiordania. Secondo i quotidiani Israel Hayom e Maariv , il primo ministro Benjamin Netanyahu e altri ministri hanno difeso Bar dopo che Ben Gvir ha sostenuto che il capo dello Shin Bet è responsabile\ndegli insuccessi che hanno portato al massacro di Hamas del 7 ottobre nel sud di Israele. Il ministro della Sicurezza nazionale ha accusato Bar di «un fallimento nell'intelligence e di aver costantemente chiuso un occhio davanti al terrorismo e al nemico che ha pianificato omicidi di massa per anni» e di «cooperare con il movimento di protesta che ha indebolito l'esercito». Ben Gvir ha accusato Bar anche di incitamento all'odio contro di lui e di «interferenza con la politica». Il capo dello Shin Bet ha inviato ieri una lettera a Netanyahu avvertendo che le recenti azioni terroristiche ebraiche come il massiccio attacco al villaggio palestinese di Jit nel nord della Cisgiordania hanno messo Israele sull'orlo del disastro, ha detto Channel 12. Ha accusato Ben Gvir e altri membri della coalizione di incoraggiare il fenomeno, come con la recente visita del ministro della Sicurezza nazionale alla Spianata delle mosche (Monte del tempio, per gli israeliani).\n17:13 | 22 Agosto M.O.: Hamas e Jihad islamica, Israele si ritiri da Gaza I leader di Hamas e della Jihad islamica palestinese hanno chiesto il ritiro completo dell'esercito israeliano dall'intera Striscia di Gaza per poter raggiungere un accordo con Tel Aviv. Lo scrive l'agenzia iraniana Irna. Dopo l'incontro con il Segretario generale del Movimento della Jihad islamica, Mohammed Darvish, il capo del Consiglio consultivo di Hamas, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, e il suo vice, Mohammed al-Hindi, hanno rilasciato una dichiarazione congiunta e hanno annunciato che per raggiungere un accordo con Tel Aviv sono necessari il completo ritiro dell'esercito israeliano dall'intera regione della Striscia di Gaza, l'inizio della ricostruzione della regione, l'accordo sullo scambio di prigionieri e la fine dell'assedio.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
