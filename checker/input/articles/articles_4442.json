    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Imphal, Dec 24 (IANS) The collective call of church bodies to hold the coming Christmas in a low-key manner in view of the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur has curbed the spirit of festivity even as many prayed for peace in the trouble-torn state.\nGiven the situation where cries of bereaved families and those whose houses and properties were destroyed in the strife reverberated across the state, many devout Christians said this Christmas would be about caring and giving for the victims.\nUnlike the previous years, the Yuletide air seems restrained in the hill districts and some Christian pockets in Imphal valley.\nTangkhul Baptist Church's Pastor Rev Khayaipam Khamrang said this year Christmas will be different from preceding years.\n\"While there would be community celebrations during our service on the evening of Sunday and Monday morning, we've encouraged and requested our members not to indulge in lavish spending and grand feasting, and instead use their resources to help those who are marginalised in the current ethnic troubles and those in need,\" he added.\n\"Celebrating Christmas this year would be about sharing, caring for others and less about ourselves, all in the name of Jesus Christ.\"\nEchoing Khayaipam, a Christian from Nagaram in Imphal, Thuireisang Singlai said this Christmas has not been that great because there has been a conflict between some of their communities.\n\"Last year it was pretty amazing because all of us were united and celebrated as one. But this year due to the current situation we're unable to have a grand festival. I hope all of us can come together as one and figure out a solution and live together in peace like before,\" he said.\nThe impact of the strife has also hit the X-Mas gift outlet dealers in Imphal as one of them said that \"we used to do brink sale during Christmas but this year we could sell only 25 per cent of what was sold last year. I hope the situation will improve soon\".\nExtending its Christmas greetings, the Manipur Naga Youth Organisation (MYNO) expressed heartfelt wishes for peace among the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. Emphasising unity and understanding, it urged everyone to build bridges of friendship, fostering harmony across Manipur's diverse cultures.\nMNYO President Athot Keitang affirmed the organisation's commitment to promoting peace and goodwill, not just during the festive season but year-round.\nA few days back, the All Manipur Christian Organisation (AMCO) had called upon heads of denominational churches and Christians of the state to celebrate the ensuing Christmas in a low-key manner in the spirit of peace, forgiveness, love and unity.\n--IANS\nsc/vd\nMENAFN24122023000231011071ID1107653224\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "It’s the most ridiculous and unnecessary sports season I have ever witnessed, so why do I miss it already — and why does it especially make me miss my dad?\nIf you have ever watched a soccer league game involving 3- and 4-year-olds, you know why I consider such a sports season ridiculous and unnecessary. Tiny children in oversized jerseys — that make them look even smaller — running up, falling down and tripping over each other, converging on a ball at the same time, like competing swarms of bees and ants on a dropped popsicle.\nAnd yet, as the grandfather of one of those 4-year-old athletes, that league gave me so many reasons to smile, including some scenes that I have never seen before in sports.\nIn what other sports league, in the middle of a game, would two players suddenly decide to start playing in the dirt in the middle of the field, drawing other players to stop and join in the magical lure of dirt?\nIn what other sports league would a spectator, a fellow grandfather, run onto the field, pick up his granddaughter who hadn’t kicked the ball once in the first six games, and swing her back and forth when the ball comes her way, making contact, leaving the crowd cheering, and grandfather and granddaughter smiling?\nAnd in what other sports league do all the fans from both teams line up at the end of the game and form a tunnel so the players from both teams can run through it to the cheers of everyone?\nNone of the players worry about the final score, just that the parent in charge of the post-game snacks has fulfilled this awesome responsibility.\nThere was a time when I scorned such leagues for what I considered too-young players. I come from a generation when neighborhood children gathered on open diamonds, grass fields and asphalt courts and made our own games, kept our own rules — playing football in the street, faking a defender into a parked Chevy before racing to the telephone pole that marked a goal line.\nThose days also came with their own ridiculous moments, like the time the cops were called in response to one of our baseball games on an empty grass lot. It made no sense to my group of then-10-year-old boys that the police — surely there was something more important for them to do — came rushing down the street with sirens blaring and lights flashing just because one of us had hit a baseball into a lady’s vegetable garden.\nOK, so the lady had warned us she was going to call the cops if it happened again. And it didn’t help that Jimmy had knocked down part of her fence chasing the ball. Or that in his haste to stop the winning run from scoring, Jimmy lost his glasses and desperately began picking up anything resembling a baseball to throw home — which explained the splattered tomatoes and scattered heads of lettuce.\nSo, when we heard the sirens, we picked up Jimmy, found his glasses and raced to our homes where we hid under beds or in closets until the coast was clear.\nIt was a different world from the childhoods of today, one I look back on with wonder. But I also realize that things change, including our society’s approach to sports.\nWe now live in a world where it apparently takes five former coaches and players to analyze a pro football game, where a college athlete can sometimes make more money in college than the pros and where professional leagues promote gambling.\nI could long for the bygone era of my youth, but I’ve learned to embrace the joy and beauty that life gives you during its different seasons. And I found joy and beauty this past spring watching 3- and 4-year-olds playing a game that makes the parents and grandparents of opposing teams cheer everyone.\nBesides, what I really long for struck me when I watched these tiny kids interacting with their dads. I miss the shared sports moments I had long ago with my three now-grown children.\nIncluded in those long-ago moments were walks to a nearby football field with my two sons, who are separated by 19 months of age. I was the steady quarterback, the Joe Montana ’79 wannabe who had less than one percent of his ability. And the boys challenged each other in ways only brothers so close in age can, taking turns as two other Notre Dame greats, wide receiver Raghib “Rocket” Ismail ’94 and cornerback Todd Lyght ’91.\nIt helped form a deep bond between them that has lasted through the years, including as high school teammates and forever-close friends. I had a front-row seat during that journey, coaching them, pushing them, encouraging them, cheering them and most of all, enjoying being with them on that memorable ride. And I like to think it says something about our bond that one of my sons still calls me “Joe” on the rare times I drop back these days to throw an even more wobbly pass.\nI strived for that same kind of connection with our daughter, born 10 years after the younger of her two brothers. My relationship with her inspired my book, When God Cheers. Since the story involves a dad who is overbearing at times, I contend it is a work of fiction based very loosely on our relationship when she played basketball in high school. My daughter rolls her eyes and smiles when she hears me call it “a work of fiction.”\nOne of my favorite moments between us occurred one summer evening when she played in a recreational softball league. She often dragged me into our backyard to practice her pitching or to get some extra batting practice. She took great glee in thumping my pitches against the back of our house. This was especially true when the extra-soft, practice softball rattled the kitchen window, which then led her suddenly rattled mother to open the back door to chastise her suddenly sheepish father about the wisdom of practicing in the backyard.\nSuch are the moments that bond a dad and a daughter.\nAs much as I miss those shared times with my children, I also miss the countless times I shared with my father when I was a boy and a ball connected us in so many ways beyond sports.\nI grew up hearing the stories of my father growing up. He’d tell me about the old neighborhood, the old gang, the Saturday matinees, the games of stickball on a narrow city street, the races around a cinder track, the way he got the nickname “Shaggert” because of his ability to race across a baseball field and “shag” long, deep drives. All parts of a childhood different from mine.\nAt times, the stories were hard to believe. But when I was in the fourth grade at my Catholic school, a new parish priest came into our room, and after we each told him our names, he asked me if my father was the “Shaggert” Shaughnessy and reminisced about my dad’s outfield skills.\nAnd so it all became part of my appreciation for my dad, along with his love of Notre Dame and animals, along with the memory of the first time I saw him cry, on the day his father died.\nFive years ago, in the early morning hours of May 29, surrounded by his family, my dad died. That day always sparks memories of him.\nOne of the most enduring memories recalls our time together sharing a baseball dream. It started in sessions with a bat and a ball, when any connection of bat and ball brought smiles to both of us.\nThat bond stayed constant as I grew older and he kept challenging me to expand my skills. He never hit fly balls straight to me, instead spraying them in front of me, over me or far to my left and my right, testing my range, testing my reflexes, testing me. And I loved it.\nI also loved walking off the field side by side with him — and the feel of his arm around my shoulders.\nThat feeling, that sharing, that desire to be there with me, and for me — they were all expressions of love.\nThe love between a father and his child.\nSome things never change.\nJohn Shaughnessy’s four books include The Irish Way of Life: Stories of Family, Faith and Friendship. He is assistant editor of The Criterion, the newspaper of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.",

    "text": "Le feu à Marseille en \"très nette régression\", l'évaluation des dégâts commence\nLe violent incendie qui a menacé Marseille mardi, dopé par une longue canicule et un mistral violent, est en \"très nette régression\" mercredi matin, selon le préfet, même s'il n'est toujours pas fixé, et la phase d'évaluation des dégâts a commencé, avec au moins 10 maisons détruites.\n\"Le feu est en très nette régression mais il est évident que sur un feu aussi impactant, sur autant de surface, il peut y avoir de nouveaux départs, des sauts, des fumerolles\", a insisté le préfet des Bouches-du-Rhône, Georges-François Leclerc, lors d'un point presse au PC sécurité installé dans les quartiers Nord à Marseille.\n\"La progression du feu est arrêtée, nous sommes à 750 hectares\" touchés, a ajouté le vice-amiral Lionel Mathieu, chef du bataillon des marins-pompiers de la deuxième ville de France. Et 700 pompiers sont toujours mobilisés.\nA ce stade, 70 maisons ont été \"atteintes\" et 10 ont été totalement détruites et \"nous sommes en train de réfléchir ensemble, dès que nous aurons le bilan bâtimentaire, à une aide aux victimes\", a indiqué le préfet.\nFace à cette amélioration, les 15.000 habitants du 16e arrondissement ont été déconfinés tôt dans la matinée. Ils avaient été confinés mardi vers 16h00 alors que le feu arrivait sur leur quartier, tous prévenus sur leurs téléphones par le système FR.alert.\nPlus tôt mercredi, les autorités avaient évoqué une \"réactivation du feu\" dans la nuit du côté des Pennes-Mirabeau, cette commune limitrophe de Marseille au nord, d'où était parti mardi en fin de matinée cet incendie, après un feu de véhicule.\nSi le ciel est redevenu bleu mercredi matin dans la cité phocéenne, une odeur de brûlé persiste. Le mistral s'est considérablement calmé mais les autorités craignent une reprise des bourrasques à la mi-journée.\nAucune information sur la qualité de l'air n'était disponible mercredi, en raison de \"l'évacuation du centre de données\", indique AtmoSud.\n- \"Eté à haut risque\" -\nLe panache de fumée dégagé avait provoqué la veille une concentration en particules fines dix fois supérieure aux normes sur Marseille et s'étendait en mer sur une centaine de kilomètres, selon les images satellites.\nEt un vent de panique avait gagné le nord de la ville: \"J'ai essayé d'éteindre au maximum le feu dans le jardin, les haies et compagnie. Et bon, quand j'ai réussi à éteindre, j'ai vu que la maison de mon voisin prenait feu. Avec la chaleur, je ne pouvais plus rester. Donc, je me suis complètement arrosé, j'ai pris ma voiture et je suis descendu\", a témoigné auprès de l'AFPTV Djamel Yahiaoui, retraité de 56 ans habitant l'Estaque.\nCes feux virulents dans le sud du pays en tout début d'été inquiètent.\n\"Il y a tout lieu de penser qu'on va vers un été à haut risque\", avait averti Bruno Retailleau mardi soir, à Marseille. 400 personnes au total ont été évacuées face à cet incendie, dont les 71 résidents d'un Ehpad aux Pennes-Mirabeau, selon le ministre de l'Intérieur.\nDe fait, les conditions météo, canicule et végétation desséchée, rendent ce début d'été particulièrement dangereux: rien que mardi, les pompiers des Bouches-du-Rhône sont intervenus à 40 reprises sur des incendies ou départs de feu mardi, un chiffre \"exceptionnel\", six fois plus élevé qu'en moyenne.\nLe ministre a appelé au civisme, rappelant que neuf incendies sur dix sont d'origine humaine.\nInterrompu mardi après-midi, avec plus de 110 vols annulés, le trafic à l'aéroport d'Aix-Marseille Provence, le quatrième français en nombre de passagers, situé sur l'étang-de-Berre, à Marignane, a repris partiellement sans la soirée.Et la reprise totale des vols a été décidée mercredi matin. Mais la situation pourrait évoluer en fonction des besoins aériens à mettre en place, a précisé la porte-parole de l'aéroport.\n- Reprise du trafic des TGV -\nSur la route, le trafic doit également reprendre dans la matinée sur l'A55, en direction de Marseille, et c'est \"en prévision\" dans l'autre sens.\nSur l'autoroute A7, vers Aix-en-Provence et Lyon, \"deux voies devraient être sanctuarisées pour les secours dans le sens Lyon Marseille\", avait précisé dans la matinée la préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône.\nLa circulation des trains à grande vitesse à Marseille a repris depuis 06h00, mais le trafic TER sur la ligne Marseille-Miramas est toujours interrompu jusqu'à midi par la Côte bleue et Rognac.\nA l'autre bout du littoral méditerranéen, près de Narbonne, dans l'Aude, département touché par trois feux de forêt en une semaine, plus d'un millier de pompiers venus de toute la France continuent de lutter contre l'incendie qui a parcouru au moins 2.000 hectares de forêt depuis lundi.\nLà aussi le feu, parti d'un domaine viticole des Corbières, s'est très vite propagé, sur une végétation desséchée et sous l'effet d'un vent soufflant jusqu'à 90 km/h.\nDans l'Hérault, l'incendie de Castelnau-de-Guers, qui avait entraîné la fermeture temporaire mardi de l'autoroute A9 entre Sète et Agde, a été fixé vers 05h00 mercredi. Celui de Montdardier (Gard), qui a parcouru 500 hectares, n'est pas encore maîtrisé, selon les pompiers.\npublié le 9 juillet à 10h34, AFP",
