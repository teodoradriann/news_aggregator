    "text": "Turning a lifelong hobby into a successful business is a dream for most people, and local baker Emily Posey made it her own dream come true.\nPosey, who has enjoyed baking since she was a child, now operates her own sourdough microbakery. Every week, she sells an array of carefully crafted sourdough baked goods from a shed — known as The Bread Shed — that sits just outside her Bristow home.\n“There is something great about turning simple ingredients into a delicious thing,” Posey said. “I wanted fresh bread to be a core memory for my son, baking and enjoying it together. That’s why I started perfecting it professionally. That’s why it has been so special for me to turn my baking into a business. My son is now really proud of what I’ve done.”\nBusiness took off for Posey when she moved to her new neighborhood last year and word began to spread.\n“I started to share loaves with neighbors, and I realized there was a demand in my community for fresh artisan bread,” she said. “Then, in the late summer last year, we built the shed, which I stock every week.”\nIt’s more than just a catchy name that keeps her customers returning to The Bread Shed. Posey caters to her clientele, baking just about anything that can come with a sourdough base.\n“I plan a lot based on what people recommend for me, which is why I take suggestions in The Bread Shed,” she said. “If something is popular, I’ll increase production. I feed off what the community is telling me and what they like. What always goes fast are my classic loaves, cinnamon rolls, and brown butter chocolate chip cookies.”\nClosing in on the list of most in-demand items are brownies and focaccia bread, she added.\nPosey — a one-woman show — has the entire business down to a science.\n“In the days leading up to stocking, I post on my Facebook page what’s going to be available, and on what days,” Posey said. “As I walk out with a cart, people are waiting.”\nIt was early in her bread-making journey that Posey homed in on making sourdough.\n“Sourdough is really interesting with its natural fermentation process,” she said. “It uses a natural starter — wild yeast instead of commercial yeast. It has a really good, tangy, sour flavor, and it doesn’t contain preservatives or added sugars, making it a more wholesome bread option for a lot of people.”\nFor Posey, giving life to the Bread Shed has been about infusing more wellness into her community. Unlike so many business owners who hope to expand their home-based business to storefront operations, Posey aims to keep things relatively simple.\n“I like being small-scale and out of a home because it allows me to focus on quality over quantity,” she said.\nFor more information, follow Carb Perfection Sourdough Microbakery on Facebook and Instagram.

    "text": "Islamabad: Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n\"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n\"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 23 February 2024, 11:35 IST)",

    "text": "Bob Keroack TRIBE SCRIBE: Dedication to nutrition helps Kadin Lynch do what he does on the field 11/7/2024 4:21:00 PM By Dave Johnson W&M Athletics What college student wouldn't savor a nice, cheesy slice of pizza? If our subject is Kadin Lynch, William & Mary's sophomore left guard, it's someone who views it only as a means to an end. Lynch has long been a workout fiend, but since coming to college he's become strongly interested in how nutrition correlates with physical fitness. His daily food intake consists mainly of grilled chicken, rice, fruits, vegetables, milk and Greek Yogurt. He goes to the grocery store and prepares it himself. \"I've gotten pretty passionate about learning how you perform is impacted by what you eat and how you train,\" said Lynch, who (no surprise) is majoring in kinesiology. \"Being able to refine my knowledge in that field has also helped me work harder and perform better. \"Being able to improve every aspect both on and off the field, my life mentally and physically, I attribute a lot of that to nutrition and eating well. Taking care of my body so I can stay healthy, stay on the field, and help the team is the biggest benefit of that.\" As for that slice of pizza, which generally (depending on ingredients) packs at least 300 calories, 12 grams of fat, 600 milligrams of sodium and 35 carbs? \"Very, very rarely will I splurge on anything like that,\" said Lynch, a very fit 6-foot-4, 295 pounds. \"If I do, it's typically post-game, trying to eat calories back into my body after performing on the field. \"But I try to be as strict as I can because when you need to consume a lot of calories, if you consume the right calories, they'll help you more in your recovery process than eating a bunch of junk food.\" Tribe coach Mike London is impressed with Lynch's dedication. \"I don't think I've ever seen him with a Snickers bar or a soda, anything like that,\" he said. \"He goes through the whole nutrition that equates to body fat percentage, to strength and conditioning, and rest and recovery. He's like the poster child to how you go about it.\" It's clearly paying dividends. As a redshirt freshman last season, despite starting only five games, Lynch was rated the No. 1 guard in the CAA by Pro Football Focus. PFF does game-by-game rankings, and Lynch was No. 4 in the FCS for last week's win at North Carolina A&T. \"It's impressive how he's taken it upon himself to maximize what he has,\" said Mario Acitelli, the Tribe's offensive coordinator and line coach. \"He puts himself in a good position and is ready when the time comes. He was ready last year, and he played really well. \"One of the most important things on the offensive line is the more you can play next to people for a longer period of time, the easier it gets. He's been next to (left tackle) Charles Grant and (center) Ryan McKenna for every game this season, and that's been really good.\" With Grant, Lynch and McKenna starting all nine games this season, the Tribe's offensive line is making room for a rushing attack that ranks third nationally at 252.4 yards a game. They're a main reason why Bronson Yoder is closing in on his second 1,000-yard season in three years. Born in Orlando and raised largely in Pittsburgh, Lynch was a two-time all-state right tackle (his quarterback was a lefty) at Asheville (N.C.) High. His parents have relocated to Richmond, but his brother and sister-in-law still live in Asheville, which remains in recovery mode after being hit hard by Helene. \"They both lost their car, but other than that, the house and everything was good,\" Lynch said. \"There's definitely a lot worse in the area.\" Lynch's high school coach was Cort Radford, who was a student assistant coach at Appalachian State during Acitelli's playing days there. Flash-forwarding a bit, and Acitelli met Lynch at a University of North Carolina football camp in 2021. When he was hired at W&M in January 2022, Acitelli was asked if he knew of any offensive linemen the Tribe should pursue. He immediately mentioned Lynch, and lead recruiter Darryl Blackstock took it from there. Lynch redshirted the '22 season and, his body lean and properly nourished, was ready to go for '23. Each day, Lynch shoots for 5,000 to 5,200 calories. His other daily allowances are 340 grams of protein, 140 grams of fat, and between 480-525 grams of carbohydrates. \"I'll track that pretty consistently, and there are very few exceptions in my diet,\" Lynch said. \"I look at the food I eat more as fuel to help me perform. And the reason I'm in the position I am is because of what I'm able to do athletically. \"It's pretty much the same stuff every day. I'm pretty consistent with what I eat.\" Lynch's dedication to nutrition has spread to the classroom. In addition to majoring in kinesiology, he's a TA with two of Assistant Professor Stephanie Caligiuri's classes — Science of Nutrition and Nutrition and the Brain. After his football career ends, hopefully after a lengthy stay in the NFL, Lynch wants to get into supplemental research and development in nutrition. Until then, he'll always be willing to share his knowledge and experience with a teammate. \"Charles Grant, a projected draft pick, came to me this past summer when he was trying to put on some weight and do it the proper way,\" Lynch said. \"To help him with that process and see it pay off as he's playing at a heavier weight now, it's fantastic. It's something I love to do.\" Print Friendly Version",

    "text": "Menu\nSign in now Close News Software Submenu Operating Systems Submenu Home Submenu Gaming Close NotebookLM can now search the web, and it’s a game changer for research By Mahnoor Faisal Published 10 hours ago Follow Followed Like Thread Link copied to clipboard Sign in to your XDA account\nSummary Google added a \"Discover sources\" feature to NotebookLM, allowing users to describe what they need and let the AI search the web for them. NotebookLM now curates up to 10 recommended sources for users based on their topic, making research easier and more targeted. The new feature uses Gemini's capabilities and is the first of many upcoming NotebookLM features to enhance research capabilities. NotebookLM, Google's AI-powered note-taking app, is one of the best AI tools available for students and researchers alike. While it's impressive, it's not without its flaws. I recently outlined four features I’d love for Google to add to NotebookLM next , but they just introduced a feature I never even knew I needed. And while part of me worries that NotebookLM could start hallucinating information (which, for now, it doesn’t), it’s still a neat addition.\n4 features in NotebookLM that changed how I study At this point, I might just owe NotebookLM my degree.\nPosts 5 NotebookLM can now use Gemini to find sources for you Since its launch, you’ve always had to manually populate a notebook with sources to use any of NotebookLM's features, like Audio Overviews or even the recently-launched Mind Maps feature . You could add PDFs, Google Docs or Slides, website URLs, public YouTube video links, or paste text.\nToday, Google announced a new Discover sources option through a blog post on The Keyword . With this feature, instead of spending time manually searching for sources, you can let NotebookLM search the web for you (powered by Gemini, of course) and do all the heavy lifting.\nTo use this new feature, simply open a new or existing notebook. Instead of adding sources as you normally would (which you can still do), you’ll now see a Discover sources button right next to the Add source button in the Sources panel.\nOnce you click it, a text box with the prompt \" What are you interested in? \" will appear.\nAll you need to do is describe what you’re looking for. Like with any AI tool, the more specific you are, the better. After that, click the Submit button. NotebookLM will search through \"hundreds of potential web sources in seconds,\" analyze them, and shortlist the most relevant ones based on your topic.\nIt will then curate a list of up to 10 recommended sources, along with a summary explaining their relevance. You can then check the box next to each source you’d like to import into your notebook and click Import when you're ready.\nWe tried it out by typing \" XDA-developers \" into the text box, and here’s what we got:\nAs shown in the screenshot above, the tool didn’t just pull links to the site, but also included a few links from Reddit, which I found pretty interesting. If you search \" XDA-developers \" on Google, you’ll notice that while a Reddit community called r/xdadevelopers appears on the first search page, the sources NotebookLM gathered also included specific posts from that Reddit community.\nThis suggests that NotebookLM isn’t just pulling general search results (like many AI tools do), but is curating a more focused and relevant set of sources based on your exact query.\nYou can use these sources as you would normally in NotebookLM, whether for generating Audio Overviews, Mind Maps, FAQs, Q&As, quick summaries, asking questions, and much more.\nIf you're in the mood to learn something new, there’s also an I'm feeling curious button, which generates sources on a random topic. We tried it out, and it surprisingly pulled up several links all about ice hockey. Specifically, the rules surrounding misconduct penalties.\nHonestly, I found this really interesting, since this isn’t something I’d typically expect from a random topic generator.\nGoogle’s blog post mentions that this is the \"first of a series\" of NotebookLM features using Gemini’s capabilities to collect relevant sources. So, it's safe to say I'm excited to see what else Google has up its sleeve. This feature is rolling out starting today for all NotebookLM users, with the rollout expected to take about a week.\nFollow Followed Like Readers like you help support XDA.
