    "title": "United Methodist 'Safe Sanctuaries' Excludes Traditionalists - Juicy Ecumenism",
    "text": "Since the last General Conference took place, the United Methodist Church in West Virginia (WVUMC) has insisted that all viewpoints on sexual matters will be respected and that individual churches can act in accord with their conscience.\nRecent conference actions demonstrate that this is not the case. The WVUMC chose to update its Safe Sanctuaries policy to include a section on “LGBTQ+ Youth” and, despite its vague language, it is anything but inclusive.\nThe Safe Sanctuaries program began in 1996 with the admirable goal of preventing abuse within churches. Each conference adopts its own policy, and individual churches are supposed to use these guidelines to formulate plans for their individual churches. Laity, who work with children, are supposed to receive Safe Sanctuaries training.\nWhile the UMC’s Discipleship Ministries’ website has included guidelines on LGBTQ inclusion since the early 2010’s, not every conference chose to include them in their policies. The WVUMC was a conference that waited until after the General Conference made changes to The Book of Discipline regarding the church’s teaching on human sexuality.\nIn fact, the WVUMC’s policy prior to 2024 is remarkably clear of any references to gender identity or sexual orientation. Instead, the past policy focused on what it should focus on, reasonable standards to ensure no one would have access to abuse children.\nThe 2024 policy demonstrates a significant change in the conference’s public stance on the issue. This change is significant for several reasons. WV had a limited church exit compared with other conferences . One reason was that the WVUMC decided to narrowly interpret the wording about conscience in paragraph 2553 of The Book of Discipline . Its interpretation excluded traditionalists whom the conference claimed had no basis for conscience concerns.\nIt is significant then that the conference waited to include the “LGBTQ+ Youth guidelines”, which would have raised conscience concerns, until after General Conference and after the paragraph 2553 December 31 st deadline. I have spoken with several sources in the state who went through Safe Sanctuaries training, who were surprised by the changes to guidelines. The conference waited to adopt the guidelines into the conference policy until the exit deadline was passed and churches were trapped.\nWhile vague, the guidelines’ wording is anything but the neutrality WVUMC leadership promised congregants after General Conference. Guidelines include, “Avoid assumptions about a young person’s sexual orientation or gender identity; Respect and use chosen names and pronouns; Do not disclose information about someone you do not have explicit permission from that person to share; Stay educated on the proper use of terminology; Be intentional about creating and maintaining a safe environment and culture of awareness around derogatory language and bullying; Use gender-neutral spaces and terms as much as possible.”\nThe Discipleship Ministries’ website expands on these guidelines and makes clear it wants to “normalize” the behavior discussed.\nThese changes also impact the ability of traditionalists to participate in youth and children’s ministries. Do 85-year-old church ladies really need to keep up with modern gender terminology? According to the guidelines, they must. What do the guidelines mean by gender-neutral spaces? Little guidance is given in the WVUMC guidelines, but the Discipleship Ministries’ expanded guidelines seem to confirm the worst interpretation of the wording. Should parents be notified if their child “comes out” at a youth event? The guidelines suggest no. And traditionalists cannot affirm these requirements.\nThis is troubling because, if the guidelines represent the position of the conference, then ministry leaders, who require students to use restrooms according to their biological gender or who tell a parent about their child’s sexual decisions, will not have the support of the conference when challenged. Whether they say it publicly or not, the leadership of the WVUMC has decided that it has no room for traditionalists in their ministry to youth and children.\nThe policy itself makes clear that the church does not take a neutral stance on these issues, “While there is much discussion ongoing in The United Methodist Church about human sexuality, we are obligated as Methodists to “do no harm.” No theological position of the church changes our need to protect the children, youth, and vulnerable adults in our congregations.”\nThe guidelines will also be of concern to more traditional parents. Safe Sanctuaries was created to ensure the safety of youth, but the new guidelines have the potential to do the opposite. The new guidelines will make families feel uncomfortable in allowing their children to participate in ministries of the church.\nSignificantly, they also shift the focus of the policy away from its original intent. Churches should work to ensure the children in their care are safe from sexual abuse. The new guidelines focus on woke virtue signaling rather than the significant task of making sure churches are safe for children.\nFor congregants wondering if they can stay inside the WVUMC as traditionalists, the answer seems to be no. Sooner or later they will be expected to adopt a position that violates their conscience. When they feel they cannot do so, all the WVUMC’s talk about neutrality will do them no good. The WVUMC will not support them in the exercise of their conscience.\nAdoption of the guidelines in the WVUMC is simply one more example of the WVUMC’s exclusion of traditionalists from its vision of the church going forward.\nReveal Comments Reveal Tags No comments yet\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

    "text": "Taylor Swift's new album comes out Friday, and one Utah couple is going all out to show the world they are the ultimate Swifties. They're recreating an album cover each day until the new one is released. Charlie Bird has taken it upon himself to turn his husband, Ryan Clifford, into the iconic singer every day this week, and nearly a million viewers have tuned in for each new release. Clifford said that the idea to do the album covers came from the couple's Halloween costume when they dressed up as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. \"Halloween is one of, if not my favorite holiday, and so I always go all out every year,\" Clifford said. A lot of people loved it, because that Halloween post received 8 million views and over 200,000 likes. \"From there, it just generated a lot of interest in Ryan, with his blonde hair,\" Bird said. \"A lot of people thought it was funny that he used his real hair to dress up like Taylor Swift. It's a very silly juxtaposition to have a man with a beard dressing up as Taylor Swift.\" To prepare for the April 19 album drop, the two came up with the idea to flaunt the hair, again. \"I don't think I knew what I was getting myself into,\" Bird said, adding the response has been better than he anticipated. \"It's kind of fun because we've created this little subculture bubble, within the subculture of Taylor Swift fandom, where we have these people who are anticipating our release,\" he said. \"Every evening, we bring people on the journey of the photo shoot, dressing up and doing the editing. It's just been really fun. It feels like a really light and happy thing to share.\" As for whether the couple hopes the real Taylor Swift sees their recreations, Clifford said he hopes she's \"somewhere far away from the internet, relaxing.\" \"I keep laughing because I'm putting on these ridiculous outfits and posing and it seems to be sparking a lot of joy in people and it's just so silly but it's awesome,\" Clifford said. And Bird agreed, adding it has really been the couple's goal, all along, to bring smiles to people's faces. \"We have such a fun and uplifting following on social media,\" Bird said. \"The internet can sometimes be a really stressful and heavy place, but it's so cool to be reminded of how many fun and supportive people are out there. And it's been a really cool way to gather people together and just create a little bubble where we're happy despite everything else that might be going on in the world.\" The Utah duo will release their own version of the new album on Friday.

    "text": "Exclusive: Recordings, emails show how Trump team flew fake elector ballots to DC in final push to overturn 2020 election CNN By Marshall Cohen, Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Herb and Katelyn Polantz, CNN (CNN) — Two days before the January 6 insurrection , the Trump campaign’s plan to use fake electors to block President-elect Joe Biden from taking office faced a potentially crippling hiccup: The fake elector certificates from two critical battleground states were stuck in the mail. So, Trump campaign operatives scrambled to fly copies of the phony certificates from Michigan and Wisconsin to the nation’s capital, relying on a haphazard chain of couriers, as well as help from two Republicans in Congress, to try to get the documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence while he presided over the Electoral College certification. The operatives even considered chartering a jet to ensure the files reached Washington, DC, in time for the January 6, 2021, proceeding, according to emails and recordings obtained by CNN. The new details provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the chaotic last-minute effort to keep Donald Trump in office. The fake electors scheme features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictment against the former president, and some of the officials who were involved have spoken to Smith’s investigators. The emails and recordings also indicate that a top Trump campaign lawyer was part of 11th-hour discussions about delivering the fake elector certificates to Pence, potentially undercutting his testimony to the House select committee that investigated January 6 that he had passed off responsibility and didn’t want to put the former vice president in a difficult spot. These details largely come from pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was an architect of the fake electors plot and is now a key cooperator in several state probes into the scheme. Chesebro pleaded guilty in October to a felony conspiracy charge in Georgia in connection with the electors’ plan, and has met with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, who are investigating the sham GOP electors in their own states. Chesebro is an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal election interference indictment against Trump. CNN has obtained audio of Chesebro’s recent interview with Michigan investigators, and exclusively reported earlier this month that he also told them about a December 2020 Oval Office meeting where he briefed Trump about the fake electors plan and how it ties into January 6. An attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not reply to a request for comment for this story. ‘A high-level decision’ Emails obtained by CNN corroborate what Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors: He communicated with the top Trump campaign lawyer, Matt Morgan, and another campaign official, Mike Roman, to ferry the documents to Washington on January 5. From there, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and a Pennsylvania congressman assisted in the effort to get the documents into Pence’s hands. “This is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there,” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors. “And they had to enlist, you know, a US senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time.” Chesebro also discussed the episode with Wisconsin investigators last week when he sat for an interview with the attorney general’s office as part of a separate state probe into the fake electors plot, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Wisconsin prosecutors asked about the episode “extensively,” the source said, noting Chesebro discussed how a Wisconsin GOP staffer flew the certificate from Milwaukee to Washington and then handed it off to Chesebro. The firsthand account from Chesebro’s perspective helps fill in the narrative behind the effort to hand-deliver elector slates to Pence, which is vaguely referenced in Smith’s federal indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include conspiring with Chesebro and others to obstruct the January 6 certification proceeding. Before Chesebro’s guilty plea in Georgia, his attorneys reached out to Smith’s team. As of this week, he has not heard back from federal prosecutors, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Federal investigators have spoken with several individuals involved in the scramble with the phony elector certificates , according to a source familiar with the matter. This includes interviews with Trump staffers who were tapped to fly the papers to DC, and some fake electors who knew of the planning. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Asked about the episode, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his previous comments , where he said, “my involvement in that attempt to deliver spanned the course of a couple seconds,” and that, “in the end, those electors were not delivered.” ‘Day-by-day’ coordination According to the recordings of Chesebro’s sit-down with Michigan prosecutors, he explained how a legal memo he wrote for Wisconsin transformed into a nationwide operation , where Trump lawyers were “day-by-day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign.” On January 4, 2021, Morgan sent an email to Chesebro and Roman asking for confirmation that all of the Trump elector slates had been received by Congress, according to the documents obtained by CNN. Roman responded that the Michigan certificate had been mailed on December 15 but was still “in transit” at a US Postal Service facility in DC. Wisconsin’s certificate also had apparently not arrived. Chesebro told prosecutors that Morgan was “freaked out” when the campaign realized the phony certificates from Michigan were still in the mail. That same day, Morgan weighed in over email asking Chesebro and Roman to rethink how they would deliver the certificates to Pence. “As I thought about this more, a courier will not be able to access the Capitol to deliver a sealed package,” Morgan wrote on January 4, according to emails obtained by CNN “You will probably need to enlist the help of a legislator who can deliver to the appropriate place(s). I strongly recommend you guys discuss a revised delivery plan with Rudy (Giuliani) to make sure this gets done the way he wants.” ‘Can we charter a flight?’ Roman was concerned the Wisconsin documents wouldn’t reach Washington in time. “Can we charter a flight? The only available commercial from MKE (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport) to DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) arrives at 2130 tomorrow night,” Roman wrote to Chesebro on January 4 at 11:24 p.m. The job of physically flying the elector documents to Washington fell to two people: A Trump campaign staffer and a Wisconsin GOP official, according to the emails and what Chesebro told prosecutors. The Wisconsin GOP official who had that state’s elector documents landed after 10 a.m. on January 5 at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, according to the emails. Trump campaign aide Michael Brown flew with the Michigan certificates to Washington National Airport with a scheduled arrival around 1 p.m., according to emails obtained by CNN. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Brown flew to DC from Atlanta, because the Trump staffers who had custody of the Michigan ballots were in Georgia for the Senate runoffs . The campaign booked and paid for Brown’s flight on Southwest Airlines, the source said. Federal campaign finance records indicate that a pro-Trump super PAC paid the airline on the day of Brown’s flight for travel related to election “recount” efforts. Trump Hotel meetup The emails show that Brown and the Wisconsin GOP official were instructed to meet Chesebro at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington to hand off the fake elector certificates. Chesebro said in an email that he’d keep the ballots in his hotel room safe until it was time to pass them along. Wisconsin Republican Party officials were annoyed at the request to courier the fake elector certificates to Washington. “Freaking trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the senate President,” a Wisconsin GOP official wrote to then-state party chairman Andrew Hitt on January 4, according to the January 6 committee report. Hitt – who has provided information to federal investigators about the efforts to get the fake elector certificates to Washington, according to a source familiar with the matter – told the January 6 committee that the couriering ended up being overkill, because the original documents that the state party had mailed to Washington actually made it in time. Getting the certificates inside the Capitol The documents still had to be hand-delivered to Pence’s Senate office in the Capitol. The electors plot – as envisioned by Chesebro and other Trump allies – was that Pence could reject Biden’s legitimate electors and recognize Trump’s “alternate electors” on January 6, while lawmakers tallied the electoral votes from each state. Per federal law, the certificates need to be physically presented on the floor of Congress during the joint session, while lawmakers tally the electoral votes. Chesebro told investigators that Roman connected him with an aide for a Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker that he believed was Rep. Scott Perry to turn over the documents. Chesebro wasn’t certain which congressman the staffer worked for – and the January 6 report says a staffer for a different Pennsylvania Republican, Rep. Mike Kelly, helped shuttle the documents that day. “I had the Wisconsin stuff. [Trump campaign aide] Mike Brown had the Michigan stuff. We walked to the Longworth Office Building, and the guy with Perry, or whatever his name is, and some other fellow, that were like staff members of the House, took them and said, ‘We’re going to walk them over to the Senate and give it to a Senate staffer,’” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors, according to the audio obtained by CNN. “I don’t know why logistically we didn’t take it directly to Johnson. But that’s how we did it,” he added. Kelly and Perry’s offices did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Brown did not comment for this story. CNN previously reported that he testified in June to Smith’s grand jury in the Trump election subversion probe. CNN previously reported that Roman sat for a proffer interview with Smith’s team before Trump was indicted. He was also indicted in the sweeping Georgia election racketeering case, in connection with the fake electors scheme, and has pleaded not guilty. Roman’s attorney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The details from Chesebro put a finer point on how members of Congress, including a sitting US senator, were involved in making sure the electoral certificates for Trump ended up in Pence’s hands. The January 6 committee first revealed last year Johnson’s involvement in trying unsuccessfully to deliver the fake elector certificates to Pence, who announced on the morning of the joint session that it would be unconstitutional to do what Trump wanted and unilaterally overturn the election results. The committee revealed text messages during their hearings last year that Johnson aide Sean Riley sent to Pence aide Chris Hodgson, saying that Johnson “needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise.” “What is it?” Hodgson asked. “Alternate slates of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Riley responded. “Do not give that to him,” Hodgson said. ‘F**k these guys’ In his Michigan interview, Chesebro also dished on some of the internal disagreements among the Trump lawyers, campaign officials and other allies, who clashed over the purpose of the electors’ plan and how far to take things on January 6. Chesebro has maintained – then, and now – that the plan was a lawful move to preserve Trump’s legal rights. Even before the Trump electors met in their state capitals on December 14, 2020, to cast their fake ballots and sign the certificates, Chesebro heard about concerns from some of the electors about possible legal jeopardy, according to emails and text messages reported by the Detroit News and obtained by CNN. Chesebro added hedging language for the faux certificates from Pennsylvania and New Mexico in response to those concerns. He proposed to Roman and Morgan that they add the contingency caveats to the paperwork for all seven states in the plan. But Roman rejected the idea, according to the emails. “F**k these guys,” Roman texted Chesebro on December 12, 2020. By this time, the Trump campaign had essentially cleaved in two. Top officials who had managed day-to-day activity for Trump up to the election, including in court, say they ceded responsibility to Rudy Giuliani and others, such as Chesebro, according to congressional testimony transcripts. Roman effectively switched teams to work under Giuliani’s structure, according to the testimony from Morgan and others. A spokesperson for Giuliani did not reply to a request for comment. ‘It really went south on me’ Chesebro told Michigan investigators that his own emails show that Morgan remained deeply involved, including in the final hours before January 6, to ensure that the certificates reached DC. “I don’t have a really warm feeling toward, at least, the top Trump lawyers that did this, hid from me what they were doing and then lied to Congress about me. So, it’s been really difficult,” Chesebro said. In his congressional testimony, Morgan said he knew of the elector plan but wanted to distance himself from the effort, delegating the work to others, including those under Giuliani. Morgan told the January 6 committee last year that he initially believed the electors were only meant to be used as a contingency. The electors, he believed, should meet in their state capitals and cast their electoral votes but “not necessarily submit” the certificates to Congress unless “we prevailed” in court. Morgan told the committee that the plan changed in December, saying it morphed from a “cast-and-hold” operation and had “shifted to cast-and-send.” And that’s when Morgan told the committee that he backed out, testifying that he directed an aide to “email Mr. Chesebro politely to say, ‘this is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward.’” “This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero,” Morgan told the committee, later adding that he “moved on” after that email was sent. Morgan explained that he was concerned that the new plan to try to count the fake electors on January 6 “would make the Vice President’s life harder, and I didn’t want to be a part of that.” “Mr. Morgan stands by his congressional testimony,” his defense attorneys told CNN in response to his emails and Chesebro’s statements to investigators. Ultimately, on the eve of the joint session of Congress, Morgan helped get the ballots in place, according to the emails and according to Chesebro, who blamed his legal troubles squarely on the Trump campaign’s legal team. “I could have avoided all this,” Chesebro vented to Michigan prosecutors. “It’s been a real lesson in not working with people that you don’t know and are not sure you can trust, because it really went south on me.” CNN’s Avery Lotz, Annie Klingenberg, Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.

    "text": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Flu season is back. Doctors said skipping the flu shot could lead to more severe cases, especially as families gather for the holidays.There has been a significant decline in the number of people getting the flu shot. State health officials said this year only one in four people have had the shot.Most people already know that getting an annual flu shot is the most effective way to prevent the virus. It lowers the chances of having serious complications or dying.The CDC said that everyone six months or older qualifies for a jab.“Well I’m going to get it. I haven’t gotten it yet, but I’m going to get it in a couple weeks.” Don Telles said he gets a flu shot every year to protect himself because he’s been sick with the flu one too many times.Telles said, “You have no energy. You’ve got aches and pains all over the place, and, like I said, you’re just lethargic. You have no energy. You try to do something and you just can’t do it.”“I get my flu shot because it’s crappy to be sick.” Thomas Garza said he already has his seasonal flu shot. “I go get my flu shot from the VA.”In Michigan, there’s been a yearly decline in seasonal flu shots since 2020. The number has decreased from 34% to 26% in those four years .Rebecca Shein with UMH-Sparrow Pediatrics said, “Flu seems like it’s not such a big deal and most of the time it’s not. You’re sick for about a week to 10 days and you don’t feel good, but it’s not the end of the world, but it can cause many severe side effects.”Severe side effects like meningitis or pneumonia. Shein said vaccination is crucial for pregnant people, young children, and older adults.“The county, the CDC, every year they watch who’s getting sick and they look at those flu strains,” Garza said, “So then they kind of predict what this winter’s flu strains are going to be and that’s why we get a flu shot every year. Next shot’s not the same as last year.”According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the flu shot takes about two weeks for your body’s immune system to create enough antibodies to fight off the virus. So, they recommend getting your shot sooner rather than later.If you need to get a flu shot, you can go to your local health department or pharmacy.

    "text": "If all goes to plan, Wesley Redman and Jacobi Moore could be part of the Tasmania Devils' inaugural AFL list.\nThat's because the Burnie juniors have put themselves among the country's crop of 16 year olds, which will be eligible for the Devils' first draft in 2027.\nWesley (forward) and Jacobi (midfielder) had the chance to impress recruiters at the national championships on the Gold Coast last week - an experience they didn't take for granted.\n\"It was phenomenal. The facilities were amazing and it was a great opportunity to play against the better players from around the country,\" Jacobi said.\n\"With our coach [Brad Cox-Goodyer] being one of the best forwards in the state, we learned forward craft, positioning and how to sneak a few goals in,\" Wesley said.\n\"We never thought we would go out there and win [by 164 points against Gold Coast Suns Academy], because we prepared for a hard battle.\"\n'The map' also defeated the Northern Territory and Greater Western Sydney Giants to claim the pool B premiership with an undefeated campaign.\nThe Coastal contingent also included Penguin's Jordan Glover and Ulverstone's Ethan Clemons and Lucas Heazlewood, who was named Tasmania's most valuable player.\nWith the Devils set to enter the AFL in 2028, it's given Jacobi and Wesley extra motivation.\n\"I want to go as high as I can go,\" Jacobi said.\n\"We could be the draft class of 2027, so I'm keen to put all my work towards them.\n\"Especially with VFL [expected to come in next year], it's definitely something to look forward to and strive for,\" Wesley said.\nIn the short-term, Jacobi (captain) and Wesley return their focus to Burnie's under 16s team, which sits second on the ladder behind Penguin.\nThe pair, who also play in the colts, were proud to represent the Dockers on the national stage.\n\"The club is always helping us in some way to get better,\" Wesley said.\nWe could be the draft class of 2027, so I'm keen to put all my work towards them.\n- Jacobi Moore\n\"Every opportunity I've had has been through Burnie and they've put their own hands in to get me as far as I can,\" Jacobi said.\nThe NWFL junior season will come to a close on Sunday, July 27, with finals scheduled to get under way the following weekend.",
