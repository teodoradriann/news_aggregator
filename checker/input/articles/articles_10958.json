    "text": "PM Modi ends his 45-hour meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended his 45-hour meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari on Saturday. Prime Minister Modi was in Kanniyakumari on a spiritual visit. He was meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam, the place where revered Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda is believed to have had a divine vision about ‘Bharat Mata’. This coincides with the conclusion of polling for the final phase of Lok Sabha polls. Meanwhile, former Bihar Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday dismissed PM Modi’s spiritual activity in Kanniyakumari as mere “photo shoots.” “Modi ji isn’t doing any meditation, only photo shoots are happening. Once the photo shoot ends, they will come back,” Yadav said. PM Modi arrived at Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari on Thursday. According to mythology, Goddess Parvati also meditated at the same place on one foot as she waited for Lord Shiva. This is the Southernmost tip of India. Further, this is the place where India’s Eastern and Western coastlines meet. It is also the meeting point of the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. PM Modi is sending a signal of national unity by going to Kanyakumari. Prime Minister Modi concluded his election campaign in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur on Thursday, for the final phase of the general elections, which will be held on June 1. The Prime Minister held around 206 election campaign events, including rallies and roadshows, in 75 days. He also did around 80 interviews with different news and media platforms. The Prime Minister is known to undertake spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns. In 2019, he visited Kedarnath, and in 2014, he visited Shivaji’s Pratapgarh. The election for 543 Lok Sabha seats is being held in seven phases starting April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4.",

    "text": "'This is our city': Castellanos marches BC football to stunning win over SMU at Fenway Park [Jason Snow](https://www.patriotledger.com/staff/5388706001/jason-snow/) BOSTON – It's a hot topic in the college football world around this time of year: do [bowl games](/story/sports/ncaaf/2023/12/14/college-football-bowl-games-ranked/71882052007/) still have value? When [Boston College](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2023/12/27/wasabi-fenway-bowl-smu-vs-boston-college-odds-picks-and-predictions/) head coach Jeff Hafley hoisted the trophy after his team's 23-14 win over No. 17 SMU in the second annual Wasabi Fenway Bowl at Fenway Park on Thursday, he declared, \"This is our city.\" Say what you want. This bowl game meant something to these Eagles (7-6). “I don’t think you could ever call a game meaningless. These guys worked way too hard and sacrificed way too (much). So much of their lives. They weren’t home with their families on Christmas,\" Hafley said. \"I think it’s very disrespectful to think, or even say, bowl games are meaningless. Every time you have a chance to go step on the field and play, you’re lucky to do that. You better respect the game and feel honored. These guys showed that today.” The win seals BC's first winning season since it went 6-5 in 2020. “We just got that feeling: Go and send (the seniors) off right,\" said sophomore quarterback Thomas Castellanos, who received the game's offensive MVP award. \"For the guys who aren’t going to play football ever again, just to see them smile and see them be excited, that’s what it means to me.” Castellanos rushed 21 times for a career-high 155 yards and two touchdowns, and completed 11 of his 18 passes for 102 yards despite rainy conditions and a soggy grass field. The sophomore's first touchdown run (from 15 yards out) put BC ahead, 17-14, with 12:22 left in the fourth quarter. His second (from 14 yards out) came just less than three minutes later to give the Eagles a two-possession cushion. “That’s what he’s done all year,\" Hafley said. \"We joked last night – I ate dinner with the quarterbacks last night and I said, ‘Man, it looks like it’s going to rain.’ And Thomas goes, ‘I hope not. That means I’m going to carry the ball 35 times.’ I go, ‘Look, buddy. If it’s sunny or rainy tomorrow, you’re going to carry the ball 30-plus times.” More: [These stars ran to glory: South Shore high school boys cross country All-Scholastics](/story/sports/high-school/cross-country/2023/12/28/presenting-our-2023-boys-cross-country-all-scholastics-patriot-ledger-enterprise/71852520007/) Castellanos (1,113 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground this season) and junior running back Kye Robichaux (13 carries, 89 yards, 1 TD on Thursday) spearheaded the Eagles' run-heavy gameplan. Castellanos compiled 90 rushing yards and six passing yards at the half as SMU led 14-10. “The conditions in the first half made it hard to throw and catch, but I thought (in) the second half, the ability to throw and catch was there,\" Hafley said. \"I told these guys this morning – it’s going to rain, it’s going to be wet, it’s going to be cold. It’s not going to feel good, so embrace it. This is a game you play as a little kid; you roll around in the mud because you didn’t have turf at the time. Have fun with it.” The BC defense held SMU (11-3) scoreless in the second half. The Mustangs won nine straight coming into Thursday's game, and 14 points is the team's fewest output since its 28-11 loss at Oklahoma on Sept. 9. The Eagles outgained SMU, 364 yards of total offense to 309, despite the Mustangs running 20 more offensive plays (79-59). “The defense, we played our butts off,\" said senior linebacker Kam Arnold, who won the game's defensive MVP award. \"We didn’t stop fighting to the end. They made some plays, but we know how to fight through adversity. We didn’t stop.” More: [Weymouth's Megan Doyle has career night: Top South Shore sports performers for Dec. 26-31](/story/sports/high-school/2023/12/27/south-shore-high-school-top-performers-dec-26-31/72033767007/) Thursday's matchup decided whether BC finished above or below the .500 mark for the season. The team lost three in a row to Virginia Tech (48-22), Pittsburgh (24-16) and Miami (45-20) entering play, and now cap the campaign with a thrilling upset win staged on its hometown's historic (foot)ballpark. “I wanted the feeling at Georgia Tech (a 38-23 win on Oct. 21). I wanted the feeling in the locker room at Syracuse (a 17-10 win on Nov. 3). I’m tired of losing,\" said Hafley. \"I think (the team is) tired of losing. I’m tired of living with that feeling for three weeks. It just eats at you if you’re a real competitor. It doesn’t go away. You wake up in the middle of the night, you’re still pissed off. Now, we don’t have that. I’ve never been around a locker room happier.” “To end the season like that with a bowl win over a ranked team really when no one gave us a chance, let’s just be honest, it was special,\" Hafley added. \"It’ll build momentum for the guys who will be back and the right way to send off a few seniors we had. It was a special moment for us.”",

    "title": "Northern Lights May Be Visible Across Texas Through Saturday",
    "text": "SAN ANGELO, TX - San Angelo residents were treated to a rare glimpse of the Northern Lights late on Oct. 10, as the auroras reached as far south as Texas following a powerful solar storm. The National Weather Service in San Angelo confirmed that the aurora was faintly visible to the naked eye in the area, though more pronounced through cameras. Residents across Texas are encouraged to keep an eye out for the display in the coming nights. [The recent light show is the result of a strong geomagnetic storm](https://sanangelolive.com/news/outdoors/2024-10-10/strong-geomagnetic-storm-could-bring-northern-lights-texas-tonight) caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun on Oct. 8. The CME sent a cloud of plasma and charged particles hurtling toward Earth, generating auroras across latitudes far beyond their usual range. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified the solar event as a G4-level storm, one step below the most severe level of G5. The storm arrived in Earth’s atmosphere on Oct. 10 and is expected to last through Saturday, Oct. 12. While auroras are typically seen at higher latitudes, the strength of this storm has expanded their visibility, allowing those in Texas to witness the Northern Lights potentially. Areas as far south as Dallas, Wichita Falls, and Amarillo stand a good chance of seeing the auroras again in the coming days, particularly in locations with low light pollution. However, the NWS cautioned that the likelihood of seeing the aurora again in San Angelo may be lower tonight, as the chances were likely better during the initial wave of the storm. “Auroras are like weather and are not the easiest thing to predict,” the NWS said in a social media post. They advised locals to remain hopeful and watch for updates as space weather experts continue to monitor the situation. Those wanting to catch a glimpse of the auroras are advised to get away from city lights and look toward the northern horizon, particularly late at night when the sky is darkest. With clear skies expected in parts of Texas, the Northern Lights may continue to put on a rare and spectacular show through the weekend. According to NWS auroras have been seen in Texas before, with the most recent occurrence in May, although cloud cover obstructed the view locally at that time. Another notable instance of auroras visible this far south occurred in 2003. The current sightings come as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year sunspot cycle, a period when solar storms and solar flares are more frequent and intense, increasing the likelihood of auroras being visible in southern regions like Texas. The NWS will provide further updates as more information becomes available from NOAA and space weather experts. Most Recent Videos Post a comment to this article here:",

Not only was he a top target, Johnson also had UNC in his sights as well naming them to his final five schools.\nHowever, as his decision day approached, the crystal ball started aiming in a way opposite the Tar Heels’ direction. Today, Johnson made the decision official in a verbal announcement with his family and in front of his school to commit to play at the University of Kentucky.\nHe will join his friend, Malachi Moreno, and head to his home state of Kentucky .\n🚨NEWS🚨\nJasper Johnson, the No. 12 overall recruit in the country, is going back home and has committed to the Kentucky Wildcats,per sources. pic.twitter.com/GVYXEJahUq\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) September 5, 2024\nThis continues to add to the recruiting woes that UNC is experiencing in this 2025 class. However, there is still hope with a chance at the No. 1 overall recruit of the class in AJ Dybantsa.\nUNC will now shift its recruiting focus to those players where they are still in the running. The Heels have yet to get a verbal commitment from anyone in the Class of 2025, and fans are still wondering who that first one will be.\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.",
