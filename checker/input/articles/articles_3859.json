    "text": "New Florida legislation filed in favor of homeowners against HOAs State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. HB 59 gives all homeowners a one-time notification of their rules, restrictions, and covenants, making sure they know what they’re working with. State Sen. Linda Stewart is sponsoring the bill in the Senate. HB 431, which is being sponsored by Florida Sen. Victor Torres, would cap fines for violations to $500. “Currently it’s $1,000, and when I was elected in 2020 during COVID, it was brought to my attention, there was a senior citizen who needed to pressure wash her driveway. She had a hard time, like many of us, getting people to do work and between supply chain issues and people having COVID, she wasn’t able to take care of the situation and her fines went up to $1,000 and for someone on a fixed income, we just don’t want to do that to them,” Arrington said. The new cap is just the latest of several bills Torres has filed regarding HOAs since he’s been in the Senate. “The fine for me is excessive and I think fine after fine, it mounts up and they can put a lien on your home and then guess what? If the homeowner wants to sell or the homeowner passes away, you have those liens you have to clear up first,” Torres said. Two years ago, Arrington and Torres filed legislation to get rid of fines completely. They said they got some backlash on that regarding lack of enforcement. Arrington said she’s welcoming input from the public on their experiences with their HOAs, to help support the bills. To share your story, email her at kristen.arrington@myfloridahouse.gov.",

    "text": "Palestinians in Gaza, including Rafah, on Monday reportedly celebrated the news that Hamas had tentatively agreed to a ceasefire proposal in its war with Israel. Al Jazeera aired footage in the afternoon of Palestinians dancing for joy after the news broke. The head of Hamas' political agency announced early Monday afternoon that it had tentatively accepted an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal. But, next steps are not clear: U.S. officials said they weren’t sure what version of a ceasefire proposal Hamas agreed to, so the details — including the length of any ceasefire — are not confirmed at this time. Critically, Israel would have to agree to whatever Hamas greenlights. A few hours later, Israel’s military said it was striking Hamas targets in eastern Rafah — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the country’s war cabinet had “unanimously decided” to continue the operation in Rafah, but it added that Israel would send mediators to negotiate a ceasefire. Israel says the current proposal is “far from Israel’s requirements.”",

    "text": "The British Council Sri Lanka celebrated the pilot phase of the ‘Youth-Led Green and Inclusive Businesses’ project to commemorate the 2024 International Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) Day.\nThe ‘Youth-Led Green and Inclusive Businesses’ project equipped young entrepreneurs with knowledge, skills, resources and networks and aimed to transform existing businesses into greener and more inclusive models.\nThe event, titled ‘Pathways to Sustainability: Entrepreneur’s Showcase,’ marked the culmination of the project. Thirty young business leaders from Sri Lanka had the opportunity to present progressive steps undertaken by them towards making their businesses greener and more inclusive with innovative solutions as well as network with key stakeholders and advocate for common causes.\nThe British Council collaborated with two local organisations, the Green Movement of Sri Lanka and Lanka Social Ventures to implement this project.\nBritish Council Sri Lanka Country Director Orlando Edwards stated; “Our belief is that the future lies in the hands of our youth. They are not just the leaders of tomorrow but are making significant impact today. We are committed to supporting and empowering young people worldwide to address critical issues such as sustainability, and taking positive action to tackle and mitigate against the impact of climate change.”\nSustainable Development Council of Sri Lank Director General Chamindry Saparamadu, who delivered the keynote speech, highlighted the role of private enterprises in national development and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); “Private enterprises can develop business models generating greater social and environmental impact and make a vital contribution to the SDGs. British Council’s efforts will no doubt contribute to developing responsible and ethical entrepreneurship for sustainable development in the country.”\nThe showcasing event also provided young, Sri Lankan entrepreneurs the opportunity to virtually network with several young green entrepreneurs from Scotland and to share each others experiences. This collaborative effort toward sustainable development aims to scale up successful models and create a network of young entrepreneurs driving the green and inclusive agenda forward.\nThe transformative journey undertaken by the young entrepreneurs has empowered them to shape businesses that thrive economically while promoting environmental responsibility and inclusivity. By integrating sustainable practices at every step of the business, these business leaders are contributing to a greener and more equitable society.",

    "text": "Cette année, le vide-greniers traditionnel du 1er mai de l’ACLB, a été noyé sous la pluie… Quelques courageux ont bien essayé de déballer leurs stands, espérant une accalmie, mais à midi, chineurs et exposants se sont réfugiés sous le chapiteau de la restauration. Ils se sont réchauffés avec grillades et chili con carne. Puis tout le monde a couru se mettre au sec ! Pour la prochaine édition, c’est le soleil qui sera réservé en priorité.\nL’école de rugby, l’ELBB XV, a eu plus de chance côté météo, samedi 4 mai avec seulement quelques gouttes, lors de son premier tournoi de rugby. Dès 10 heures du matin, 25 équipes ont commencé la compétition sur le terrain divisé en 4 zones. De nombreux dirigeants dont ceux de l’ACLB, Tamalous, entraîneurs et bénévoles encadraient cet évènement destiné aux M6, M8 et M10. Et les sponsors avaient fourni repas, goûters et bonbons, médailles, ballons ovales et coupes. Bien sûr, nombre de parents étaient là pour encourager leur progéniture. Les plus jeunes ont joué seulement le matin tandis que les autres ont ferraillé toute la journée ! Six clubs participaient à ce tournoi, en plus de l’ELBB XV : Castanet, Entente Lauragais, Labarthe, Stade Toulousain, TEC et Revel, qui ont coloré la pelouse de rouge, bleu, vert et blanc, noir… Vers 16 h 30, en présence du maire, A. Durand, a débuté la remise de médailles à tous les jeunes joueurs. Puis, ballons de rugby pour les moins chanceux et coupes pour les plus valeureux ont été distribués. En M8, c’est Castanet et l’Entente Lauragais qui ont pris les deux premières places ; en M10, Labarthe et l’Entente Lauragais encore ont raflé les trois premières places. Et les vainqueurs ont reçu un \"bouclier\", à remettre en jeu l’an prochain.\nCet article est réservé aux abonnés Accédez immédiatement à cet article 2 semaines offertes Je m'abonne pour lire la suite Déjà abonné(e) ?
