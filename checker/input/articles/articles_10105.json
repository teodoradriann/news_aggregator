    "text": "NILES — A Niles man who tried to burn down a local apartment building three years ago was sentenced to prison Thursday in Berrien County Trial Court. Askia Ismail-Raheem Singleton, 46, of Niles, pleaded guilty to second degree arson and was sentenced to 50 months to 20 years in prison. He has credit for 1,008 days already served and must pay $258 in fines and costs. The incident occurred Dec. 1, 2020 in Niles Township. The damage from the fire caused one family to lose all their belongings, according to statements made in court. Singleton refused to leave the holding cell in the Niles courthouse and was sentenced in absentia. Defense attorney Carri Briseno noted that Singleton had been referred twice for mental competency because of his schizophrenia and received treatment before being found competent. She said his family is concerned about his future after he gets out of prison. Berrien County Trial Judge Jennifer Smith said Singleton had created a dangerous situation with his actions to set fire to the building. “He may have been targeting his neighbors,” she said. “He created an extremely dangerous situation for everybody and one family lost their belongings and their place to live.” “The court is certainly concerned about the future danger to the community,” she added. “I hope he gets the help he needs but the protection of the community is more important.” The post Niles man gets prison time for setting apartment building on fire appeared first on Leader Publications .",

    "text": "TORONTO — Commuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province. Environment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow. The weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night. It warns the snowfall could have \"significant impact\" on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways. Environment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible. It says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. The agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions. It says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving. Other parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast. This report by The Canadian Press was first published March. 22, 2024. The Canadian Press",

We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.”\nThe handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said.\nShe added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag.\n“Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace.\n“We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.”\nThe next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it.\n“Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.”\nSince Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women.\nThe body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland.\nIn February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far.\nHe was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane.\nThe rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane.\nThe sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "title": "After pushing for it, Bruce Antone wants Black history museum panel to go away",
    "text": "By Jackie Llanos ,\n2 hours ago State Rep. Bruce Antone. Credit: Florida House\nQuality Journalism for Critical Times\nLast year, Rep. Bruce Antone, a Democrat from Orange County, was one of the forces behind creating a task force to advise about what the state’s proposed Black history museum should look like. Now, he doesn’t want the group to submit any recommendations.\nThe nine members — Antone wasn’t appointed to be one of them — of the Florida Museum of Black History Task Force are supposed to meet for the last time Friday morning to put the final details on a report outlining the planning, construction, operation, and administration of the proposed museum. The group must send that report to Gov. Ron DeSantis and legislative leaders before July 1 — Monday.\nIn a scathing 23-page letter addressed to the task force, Antone wrote that, since the group didn’t accomplish its tasks, it shouldn’t make any recommendations. The law Antone sponsored requires the task force to outline where the museum would be, what artifacts it would acquire, how it would be marketed, and how it would raise its own revenue.\nThe Democratic lawmaker wrote in a press release Thursday that “the Florida Museum of Black History Task Force should quietly end and disband tomorrow.”\nAntone’s complaints about the process From the start, Antone has had his heart set on Eatonville, which lies a few miles north of Orlando. But after a hotly contested 5-4 vote during the May 21 meeting, the task force voted to recommend a plot of undeveloped land a few miles outside of downtown St. Augustine as the location for the museum.\nAntone insists that his disapproval of the task force’s work isn’t solely that the group didn’t pick Eatonville , one of the first self-governing, all-Black municipalities in the country.\n“They could have designed a museum and I could have lived, you know,” Antone told Florida Phoenix in a phone interview “Actually, I did give them a complete design, they just chose not to use it. I gave a whole bunch of recommendations and a document. I had actually designed the museum for Eatonville.”\nAfter he visited the proposed plot in North Florida, Antone said the area is too isolated. His letter accuses task force members of choosing St. Augustine because of personal preferences without considering how the county’s pitch compared to the others.\nThe Florida Museum of Black History contemplated three locations (Opa-Locka, Eatonville and St. Johns County) during a meeting on May 21, 2024. (Screenshot from Florida Channel) “St. Augustine is an hour from Jacksonville, an hour from Gainesville, an hour from Daytona, two hours from Orlando. I drove up to the museum site in St Augustine,” Antone said. “I mean, it’s on the westernmost edge of St Augustine. It is rural land. There’s nothing out there. There’s no public transportation out there right now. It is not a good location to be putting what I believe was supposed to be Florida’s world-class black history museum.”\nStill, St. Johns County carries historical significance. It was the site of Florida’s first Black settlement in 1738 when the Spanish still colonized the region, and Martin Luther King Jr. once led protests against segregation in St. Augustine.\nDelayed meeting It’s unlikely the group will listen to Antone’s request on the eve of the final meeting. Aside from sponsoring the legislation to establish the task force, he holds no power over the panel.\nThe group has little time to approve the report because the Florida Division of Historical Resources moved the meeting one week back, from last Friday, with scant notice to the public and the task force members.\nState Sen. Geraldine Thompson, Democrat from Orlando. Credit: Colin Hackley Friday morning, task force chair Democratic Sen. Geraldine Thompson of Orange County plans to recommend that all work on the museum stop until the completion of a feasibility study for the top three locations the group chose: St. Johns, Eatonville, and Opa-Locka in Miami-Dade.\n“I think we’re shooting in the dark without a feasibility study, and that is going to be something I’m going to stress during our meeting tomorrow,” she said. “The feasibility study should have been done before we started our work, rather than after.”\nFeasibility studies are detailed analyses that predict the success of a project and any problems that may arise.\nBut Antone also criticized that move, saying it would cause additional delays.\n“So, it’s probably after the legislative session in 2026 before the results of the feasibility study come back,” he said. “A lot can change in two years. I can leave the Legislature, and so there is no real advocate anymore.”\nAppropriations request Regardless of Friday’s outcome, Antone plans to request $30 million during the next legislative session to build the museum in Eatonville. He pointed out that lawmakers did the same for a Holocaust museum, which got $5 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year budget. Antone’s plan depends on whether Floridians reelect him to the House this year.\nThompson seems to be on board with that idea.\n“If he makes an appropriations request, I’d be supportive of that. However, I think the feasibility study is still necessary because, if it goes to Eatonville, what are the plans for marketing and governance? All of that would be covered in a feasibility study, so I don’t know why there’s an objection to a feasibility study.”\nIn a Republican supermajority state, Antone would need bipartisan support to secure that money.\nTask force member Tony Lee, who works with the State University System of Florida, declined to comment. Other members didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s requests for comment.\nThe post After pushing for it, Bruce Antone wants Black history museum panel to go away appeared first on Florida Phoenix .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Japan's Kazuto Ioka knocked out Venezuela's Josber Perez on Sunday in the seventh round of his first WBA super flyweight title defense.\nThe victory at Ota City General Gymnasium marked Ioka's 22nd victory in a world title fight, the most by a Japanese boxer.\nPerez came out punching hard and connected often enough to put Ioka on the defensive in the first two rounds.\n\"Right from the start Perez landed some good punches, and it was a tough way to start the fight, but I was resolved to show everyone I could battle to the end,\" Ioka said after his first knockout in three years.\nFrom the third round, Ioka began finding openings for some lethal counter punches. Two fifth-round knockdowns turned the fight Ioka's way as Perez struggled to fend off Ioka's well-timed and accurate jabs.\nWith the seconds ticking down in the seventh round, Ioka delivered two shots to the body before catching Perez square on the nose with a right that sent the Venezuelan down for the count.\n\"I'm not usually concerned about getting knockouts, but I did want one here so the fans in this venue could savor it on New Year's Eve.\"\nThe 34-year-old Ioka, who won the title in a unanimous decision in June, improved to 31-2 as a pro with one draw. He has won 16 of his bouts by knockout.\nPerez, 28, the WBA's sixth-ranked contender, saw his record fall to 20-4 in 24 fights.\nRelated coverage:\n[ Boxing: Inoue KOs Tapales, becomes 2nd man to unify 2 divisions](/news/2023/12/8d3700365c70-urgent-boxing-inoue-kos-tapales-becomes-2nd-to-unify-2-divisions.html) [Boxing: Fight fans await 2-division king Inoue's next move](/news/2023/12/449ed5ba8e82-boxing-fight-fans-await-2-division-king-inoues-next-move.html)",

    "text": "The third accused in the ongoing ambulance procurement trial, Richard Jakpa says he was taken aback at the ignorance of the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Godfred Yeboah Dame, for his apparent misunderstanding of ISO certification.\nBriefing the press after the fourth proceedings in the trial on Thursday, June 27, Mr Jakpa noted that the Attorney General incorrectly argued that ISO certification is akin to an incorporation registration, suggesting that Big Sea was incorporated in 2015.\nMr Jakpa said he attempted to correct this misconception but found the Attorney General unreceptive.\n“I tried to educate him that it is not an incorporation certificate because to incorporate a company, it must be done by a sovereign nation that has lost to incorporate companies.\n“But ISO certification is a certification by an international standards organisation that certifies manufacturing companies and private companies when they are manufacturing products about their quality standards. So seeing ISO 2015 doesn’t mean that Big Sea was registered in 2015,” Mr Jakpa explained.\nHe further argued that the document presented by the Attorney General indicated a recent re-certification, meaning it is renewed annually.\n“And the man was still swimming in his ignorance and would not admit that a private company cannot create a company to be in existence in a sovereign nation without going through the laws of that country.”\n“I don’t need to teach him that but the man was so ignorant about what is an ISO. A whole Attorney General of a nation. Just as I was educating him on an LC on the audio recording, I have been educating this young man but the man’s ignorance is just beyond unbelievable, he wouldn’t accept it because of his arrogance. It was the same thing I did with him on the LCs”, Mr Jakpa added.",
