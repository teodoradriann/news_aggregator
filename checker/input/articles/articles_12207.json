    "title": "Affirm's Stock Quintupled This Year, Beating All Tech Peers, On Buy Now, Pay Later Boom - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "Drew Angerer \\/ Getty Images A year ago, there was little holiday cheer at Affirm. The point-of-sale lender was confronting rising interest rates, recession fears and weakening consumer spending. Affirm shares ended 2022 down 90%, wiping out billions of dollars in market value.Affirm investors are wrapping up 2023 in a much different mood.The stock skyrocketed 430% in 2023, as of Wednesday's close, outperforming all other U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more. The next-best performer was Coinbase, which shot up 423% largely because of bitcoin's rebound.With the Federal Reserve setting the stage for interest rate cuts in the year ahead and more retailers signing onto Affirm's buy now, pay later offerings, or BNPL, fear of a doomsday scenario for the company has faded. Shares of Affirm got a big boost in November after the company inked an expanded partnership with Amazon, and BNPL purchases hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.\"The expectation was the consumer was going to be toast, unemployment was going to pick up and higher interest rates would destroy everything, and the exact opposite has happened on all fronts,\" said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, which doesn't have a position in the stock. \"So that's why you have a scenario where Affirm can start to perform.\"Created in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm is competing with companies including Klarna, Block's Afterpay and Zip in the burgeoning BNPL market. Shoppers who choose to pay with a BNPL service split their purchase into four or more installments typically over a period of three months to a year, without accruing compounding interest. The lenders make money from interest payments and by charging merchants fees to offer their lending services.Retailers benefit by giving consumers another option for purchasing a skateboard, watch or a gift for a family member, and one that can come with less sticker shock, resulting in fewer abandoned carts.Affirm's run-upAffirm made its public market debut on the Nasdaq in January 2021, as the Covid-19 pandemic was driving a surge in adoption of BNPL services. Shoppers flush with stimulus checks used the small loans when buying clothes, electronics and Peloton exercise bikes, which at one point accounted for 30% of Affirm's revenue. Online storefronts rushed to add BNPL as an option at checkout.But by early 2022, Affirm's share price had fallen more than 60% from its 2021 peak. The rest of the year was just as gloomy as soaring interest rates made it more expensive for Affirm to borrow money to fund installment loans. In February 2023, Affirm cut 19% of its workforce, and executives said macro headwinds and \"negative consumer sentiment\" would likely persist for the remainder of the fiscal year.As it turns out, they were overly bearish.Affirm shares started climbing higher in August after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. The company picked up new merchant deals in sectors beyond retail, such as travel, wireless, ticketing and health care. The stock has more than doubled in the fourth quarter, boosted by an announcement last week that Affirm would offer BNPL loans at Walmart's self-checkout kiosks.Even with their dramatic bounce back, Affirm shares are about 70% below their high in November 2021.Heading into 2024, BNPL lenders face cooling inflation and an optimistic interest rate environment.Dan Dolev, managing director at Mizuho Securities, said Affirm is in a strong position to retain users. He pointed to new merchant deals and the expanding market for BNPL offerings in physical stores. Affirm says 16.9 million people have used its services, and the company counts more than 266,000 merchant partners.Affirm is eyeing international expansion and has launched a debit card that lets customers pay upfront or in installments. Affirm announced at its investor day last month that it plans to introduce a spending account tied to its debit card that will allow for ATM access and direct deposit capability.\"The next year or two years are going to be something very different,\" said Dolev, who has a buy rating on Affirm shares. \"Now they've got the brand, and what are they going to do with it? They're going to turn it into a full-fledged financial services firm.\"'David against Goliath'Hayes sees more cause for skepticism. He said Affirm faces an \"uphill battle\" competing with entrenched operators such as PayPal and Block, as well as credit card companies such as American Express, Citi and Chase that have jumped into installment loans.\"It's David against Goliath, and Goliath is going to win,\" Hayes said.Hayes said Affirm is going down a similar path to online lender SoFi, trying to \"have a thousand different projects, and say we're as big as JPMorgan, but at the end of the day, it's just simply not going to work.\"BNPL lenders also face heightened risk of users failing to make payments on time. A March report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found BNPL users were on average more likely to have higher levels of credit card debt. BNPL borrowers also tend to have lower credit scores, the CFPB said, with an average score in the subprime range of 580 to 669.The Affirm website home screen is displayed on a laptop in an arranged photograph taken in Little Falls, New Jersey, on Dec. 9, 2020.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn Affirm spokesperson didn't provide a comment for this story but pointed to past comments from company executives.\"As our network grows, our moats get deeper,\" Levchin said at the company's investor forum in November. \"We get more data. We underwrite more transactions. We meet more people.\"Affirm's defaults remain low by industry standards. Average delinquency rates for peers, such as LendingClub, SoFi, Upstart and OneMain Financial, increased from 5.7% to 6.3% between January and November, while Affirm's delinquency rate fell from 2.8% to 2.6%, Jefferies analysts wrote in a report last month.Affirm says it bases loan decisions on a variety of data points in addition to a user's credit score.\"Our process involves looking at credit report data, but could also involve some Affirm-specific stuff, like what we know about the merchant and the thing they are about to sell you,\" Levchin said in a release last year.As BNPL adoption grows, regulators are keeping a close eye on the space. Last week, three U.S. senators penned a letter to the CFPB urging the agency to monitor the uptick in BNPL usage during the holidays, saying it could leave consumers overextended. The CFPB announced in September 2022 that it would subject BNPL to greater oversight, in line with credit card companies.Wells Fargo issued a report earlier this month that described BNPL loans as \"phantom debt\" that may be lulling \"consumers into a false security in which many small payments add up to one big problem.\" As it stands today, the industry is \"not a major problem for consumer spending yet,\" Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Seery Grein wrote.Since BNPL loans are not currently reported to major credit reporting agencies, they wrote, there is \"no way to know when this phantom debt could create substantial problems for the consumer and the broader economy.\"WATCH: Payments trends for 2024Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Checkout latest world news below links : World News || Latest News || U.S. News Source link",

    "title": "'A true diva in the making': 8 year old goes viral after singing national anthem at NBA game",
    "text": "An 8-year-old Washington girl's rendition of the national anthem during an Indiana Pacers game is stirring up a conversation on social media. Kinsley Murray, dressed in a one sleeve patriotic dress with stars in her hair, passionately sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” during the basketball game against the Toronto Raptors on Monday, Feb. 26. The video of her singing the national anthem was posted on the Pacers' TikTok page and has gained over 16 million views. “The passion. the outfit. this anthem performance was unmatched.” the Pacers wrote in the post. By the time Kinsley was 6, she’d already sang the U.S. national anthem at more than 100 sporting events, including baseball, football and basketball games and rodeos. Her performances include those at the Central Washington State Fair in Yakima in September 2021 and a University of Washington men’s basketball game in January 2022, according to social media posts from a user identifying himself as her father, Shafer Murray, an elementary school teacher. Kinsley got attention in 2021 for singing at a Gonzaga women’s basketball game. “I love to honor our country,” she told KREM , a TV station in Washington state. “The louder the roar, the better I get.” She’d performed “O Canada” before singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on Monday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On Tuesday, she sang at the Dayton-Davidson game in Ohio. On TikTok some users commented on the video expressing their support. Comments under the video reposted by The Daily Mail read: “The outfit... the singing... a true diva in the making,” read one comment from celine. “She is very brave,” read another comment by JAER. “I think she’s adorable,” Ashley wrote under a post of Kinsley's video. Many users on social media are bashing Kinsley’s performance saying hurtful things, but some social media users are coming to Kinsley's defense and calling her passion for the national anthem patriotic. \"I watched that video and seeing all of the disgusting comments, all the hatred, all the bully comments to that girl is absolutely atrocious,\" a user that goes by Midnight Michaelson on TikTok said. \"I would like to see everybody come on here now and tell you how sorry I am and how apologetic you are for attacking this little girl.\" Michaelson says her determination to continue to perform should be applauded. \"They saw something in her face they saw something in her heart they saw that that little girl had more love for this country,\" Michaelson said. Other TikTok users wanted to join in on Kinsley's performance. Dr. Rod Vester , a pianist, played while Kinsley sang in his post. Another user says that the national anthem is a very hard song to sing and even professionals have a have trouble belting out the song. \"The United States national anthem is a very difficult song to sing. You have to have a big voice you have to have a big strong voice, over two octaves, at least. If you hit the higher note, even more.\" said North Omaha Cat Lady in a post. \"We've seen professional musicians absolutely fall flat trying to sing the national anthem.\"",

A medida que nos acercamos al Domingo de Ramos, las condiciones meteorológicas generan incertidumbre y preocupación entre los organizadores y participantes de las procesiones. Hasta el Domingo de Ramos, el pronóstico es relativamente favorable, con temperaturas que recuerdan más a mayo que a marzo, alcanzando máximas de hasta 28 grados. Sin embargo, a partir del lunes, se espera la llegada de varios frentes que podrían cambiar drásticamente el clima. Samuel Biener, de Meteored, advierte que lo peor podría ocurrir en la recta final de la semana grande.

    "title": "CDC warns of severe illnesses linked to mushroom chocolates and gummies",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning the public to avoid Diamond Shruumz chocolates, cones and gummies following an outbreak of severe illnesses that has led to 10 hospitalizations.\nIn an alert Wednesday to health care providers, the CDC said that a dozen people in eight states have gotten sick after eating the brand’s “microdosing” mushroom edibles. All but two needed to be hospitalized.\nSymptoms included seizures, sedation, muscle stiffness, abdominal pain, abnormal heart rate and high or low blood pressure. None died, but several patients needed to be put on ventilators and were admitted to the intensive care unit, the CDC said.\nThe actual scale of the outbreak may be even larger, according to Kait Brown, clinical managing director of America’s Poison Centers. Nationwide, poison centers have received 22 reports of illnesses potentially linked to Diamond Shruumz products and are seeing new cases every day, Brown said.\nThe CDC tally represents the most severe cases, she said, but poison centers are also aware of milder cases that were limited to gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea or vomiting, or feelings of sleepiness or light sedation.\nWhy are Diamond Shruumz potentially making people sick? Diamond Shruumz says on its website that its products are meant for microdosing. Microdosing typically refers to consuming small amounts of psychoactive or hallucinogenic substances, enough to reap the benefits while minimizing more debilitating effects.\nHowever, the company also says on its website that its products don’t contain psychedelic substances. Several toxicology experts said the mushrooms listed as ingredients, such as lion’s mane or ashwagandha, don’t produce the potent effects that the company touts, like relaxation or euphoria.\n“The mushrooms that they advertise that are in them are pretty innocuous and in a lot of other products that don’t make similar claims,” said Maryann Amirshahi, co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C.\nFood & drink Jun 9 FDA expected to propose a label change to packaged foods: Nutrition info on the front health Jun 6 Common sugar substitute linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke The CDC said in its alert that products containing psychoactive ingredients, such as mushroom extracts, are becoming more available and are often sold as gummy candies, chocolate or other snack foods. Such products may contain “undisclosed ingredients, including illicit substances,” the CDC said, “or potentially harmful contaminants that are not approved for use in food.”\nDiamond Shruumz did not respond to a request for comment.\n“At this point, what is causing these symptoms in these products are still under investigation,” Brown said. “It does speak to the uncertainty about what is in the product that could make such a wide array of symptoms.”\nAre mushroom chocolates regulated? The market for mushroom-based products such as coffee or chocolate has swelled in recent years, as has demand for edibles with psychoactive properties, though psychedelic mushrooms are largely illegal in the U.S..\nToxicology experts said Diamond Shruumz products likely fall under the category of a dietary supplement based on their listed ingredients and how they’re advertised.\nDietary supplements don’t require approval from the Food and Drug Administration before being sold to customers, though the agency mandates that companies that manufacture, package, label or store supplements test their ingredients and limit contamination.\n“It’s not like a prescription medication where you have to prove safety and efficacy before you can sell it,” said Steven Dudley, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center.\n“With supplements, really it’s the other way around where there has to be reports of harm for the powers that be to be able to step in and then issue recalls, take products off the market, et cetera.”\nThat lack of regulatory oversight means that quality control is “murky at best,” said Dr. Chris Hoyte, medical director of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center in Denver.\nIn the past, some dietary supplements have been found to contain undisclosed ingredients that may cause harm. For instance, the FDA warned last year that yellow oleander — a poisonous plant — was masquerading as supplements sold for purported weight loss benefits.\nAmirshahi said the makeup of dietary supplements can also vary from batch to batch, which in theory could explain why Diamond Shruumz customers had a range of symptoms.\n“At low doses, you may see one thing and higher doses may see the other,” Amirshahi said. “So at lower doses, they may be kind of really agitated, off the rails, have high blood pressure, have a high heart rate — but if they start taking more and more of it, the effects actually change.”\nExperts also said it’s possible that psychedelics were illegally added to the products, or that the chocolates and gummies contained other legal substances that weren’t disclosed.\n“We don’t know if this is a bad batch issue,” Dudley said. “We don’t know if it’s more widespread than that. What we do know is that it’s causing harm, so we’d really urge the public to not use these products.”\nThe FDA said Tuesday that consumers should discard and refrain from eating any flavor of Diamond Shruumz chocolate bars, cones or gummies. In a statement, the agency added that it “will continue to monitor the marketplace to identify products that pose risks and will take action within our authorities against unlawful products in order to protect the public.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "title": "Dodgers Injury News: Bobby Miller In Concussion Protocol",
    "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers dropped their Cactus League opener to the Chicago Cubs on Thursday, but the most important thing from the game is the health of Bobby Miller.\nAfter taking over in the third inning, Miller was hit in the head by a 106 mph comebacker off the bat of Michael Busch. He immediately went to the ground in pain and was quickly checked on by Dodgers head trainer Thomas Albert.\n“It squared him up pretty good,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “It was kind of the front-side of the head, and you could see the distance that it traveled once it hit. There was some deflection, but it hit him pretty flush.”\nFortunately, Miller was conscious and able to answer the questions asked before he walked off the field under his own power.\n“It’s always very terrifying and frightening,” Max Muncy said. “Thankfully, he seemed like he was OK. When the trainer came out and asked him if he knew where he was at, he made a little joke about hanging a curveball. Right then, you kind of knew he was fine.\n“Obviously you have to take it slow with that type of thing. He might be fine now, but you’ve got to see how he is the next couple of days. I think he’s doing OK.”\nRoberts said Miller did not express pain while he was on the mound after being hit.\nNo X-rays were performed on Miller, but he is in concussion protocol and there is no timeline for when he’ll be able to resume baseball activities, according to Roberts.\n“Certainly it was a very scary moment,” Roberts said. “From what I’ve gathered, he’s going to be under concussion protocol. We’ll keep an eye on him tonight. I don’t know what that means as far as going forward. Certainly, it’s somewhat of a setback.\n“We’ve got to make sure he feels OK going forward. I don’t know how long this protocol lasts, but again, very scary moment. But it was good to see him walk off the field, kind of know where he was at and all that.”\nAt the minimum, Miller will be out for the next few days before they reevaluate things and see if Miller is able to resume throwing again.\n“Not concerned about that in the next 24 to 48 hours,” Roberts said. “I think he’s going to kind of regroup, lay low, and sort of get his wits about him and make sure he’s OK. After that, lord willing that he’s fine, then I think we’ll have the conversation. He’s going to want to get back out there.\nBobby Miller faces just two hitters before injury Prior to being hit by the comebacker, Miller faced just two hitters in his 2025 Spring Training debut, walking the first and allowing the single that struck his head. Both runners ended up scoring after Justin Jarvis replaced the right-hander and allowed three hits and two walks.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?
