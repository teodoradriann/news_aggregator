    "text": "Design by Yoora Kim Seventeen picks products that we think you'll love the most. We may earn commission from the links on this page.\nOn prom night you want to look like your regular self, but elevated . Because there's literally no point in spending hours getting all dressed up if at the end of it all, you feel uncomfortable with your own look. And if the real you wears sneakers almost every single day, you should skip the toe-pinching pumps and opt for cool sneaks on prom night, too.\nWe fully support your comfy-footed prom endeavors. The hard part is, finding a pair that still feels dressy enough for a ball gown type of evening. The secret is to shop options you already love, but with prom-y details. Do you live in Air Force 1s ? Go for a sleek metallic pair. Vans are your go-to? Slip into a tie-dye version. Plain white sneakers are your signature? Try a glitter option. All of those and more are right ahead for your shopping pleasure.\nOur Top Picks\nBetsey Johnson Allover Crystal Platform Sneakers $76 at David's Bridal $76 at David's Bridal Read more Converse All Star Radiating Love Sneaker $70 at Revolve $70 at Revolve Read more SHEIN Chain Decor Slip On Shoes $19 at Shein $19 at Shein Read more David's Bridal Crystal-Studded Slip-on Sneakers $34 at David's Bridal $34 at David's Bridal Read more American Eagle Butterfly Canvas Platform Sneaker $40 at American Eagle $40 at American Eagle Read more Keds Triple Kick Citrus Garden Party Sneaker $55 at Keds $55 at Keds Read more SHEIN Lace-up Front Skate Shoes $16 at Shein $16 at Shein Read more Roxy Slip On Platform Sneaker $59 at Amazon $59 at Amazon Read more SHCRTK Low Top Lace Up Canvas Sneakers $30 at Amazon $30 at Amazon Read more Michael Kors Poppy Embellished Leather Stripe Sneaker $185 at Michael Kors $185 at Michael Kors Read more Show more Betsey Johnson Allover Crystal Platform Sneakers Betsey Johnson Allover Crystal Platform Sneakers Now 15% Off $76 at David's Bridal We are firm believers that sparkles elevate *any* look.\nConverse All Star Radiating Love Sneaker Converse All Star Radiating Love Sneaker $70 at Revolve Be everyone's couple goal and wear cute matching Converse with hearts to your prom.\nSHEIN Chain Decor Slip On Shoes SHEIN Chain Decor Slip On Shoes Now 34% Off $19 at Shein The chunky chain is the perfect touch to spice up these shoes.\n David's Bridal Crystal-Studded Slip-on Sneakers David's Bridal Crystal-Studded Slip-on Sneakers Now 15% Off $34 at David's Bridal If it shimmers, sign us up.

    "text": "Friday, January 5th 2024, 3:28 pm For those looking for an escape from the cold, the Oklahoma Boat Expo is in Tulsa this weekend. With more than 200 lakes, Oklahoma is a lake lover's paradise. \"Everybody knows around Tulsa there are lakes everywhere and so the show has really been embraced by Tulsa and beyond Tulsa,\" said show coordinator Don Miner. Find More Stories Like This On The [Arca Continental Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages Porch](https://www.newson6.com/porch) The Oklahoma Boat Expo is at the Cox Business Convention Center on Friday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. \"The boats that you are going to see, it is a wide array of boats that we have out here,\" Miner said. \"You will have entry-level boats that will start out as low as $20,000 and then you have boats that will go all the way up to how much money do you want to spend today.\" Since it is the off-season for boating, show coordinator Don Miner said discounts are as much as 30% to 40% off. \"You are going to get to see deals here in January that you will not see for the rest of the year,\" he added. In its third year in Tulsa, the Oklahoma Boat Expo has more boat dealers than ever before with 18 different ones from all over Oklahoma in attendance. \"Hands down this is the biggest boat show in Oklahoma, period,\" Miner continued saying, \"There are more boat dealers here this weekend than there will be at any other show in Oklahoma this year.\" While the boats are the main attraction there is also something for the outdoorsman. Miner said, \"There is personal watercraft, there is side by sides, there is motorcycles, there is kayaks, and everything for the outdoors here.\" Making this weekend the perfect opportunity to buy before it warms up and the prices shoot up. Tickets for the Oklahoma Boat Expo are $12 at the door and free for children 12 and under. QuikTrip locations in the Tulsa metro also have a coupon for $2 off. Miner said, \"You buy a ticket for our show, and you can come back all three days, the ticket is good for the entire show.\" January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024",

    "text": "Türkiye nabs 32 suspected terrorists over plotting attacks on religious sites, Iraqi Embassy Turkish security forces nabbed 32 suspects, including three senior members of the Daesh/ISIS terror group, who were plotting to attack synagogues, churches, and the Iraqi Embassy in Türkiye, security officials said Friday, [News.Az](https://news.az/News.Az) reports citing Anadolu Agency. The Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) identified the senior members of the terror group as Mejbel Al-Shweihi, codenamed Abou Yakeen Al-Iraqi, and Mohammad Khallaf Ibrahim, codenamed Abou Laith, who were planning attacks on synagogues and churches in Türkiye. Also, Ihab Elaani, codenamed Abdullah Al-Jumaili, was plotting a terror attack on the Iraqi Embassy in Türkiye. In a coordinated operation conducted at dawn by MIT and Turkish police in nine different cities, the senior terrorists and 29 other individuals linked with them were apprehended. The operation resulted in the seizure of numerous digital materials belonging to the terror group. In 2013, Türkiye became one of the first countries to declare Daesh/ISIS a terrorist organization. The country has since been attacked by the terror group multiple times, with over 300 people killed and hundreds more injured in at least 10 suicide bombings, seven bomb attacks, and four armed attacks. In response, Türkiye launched anti-terror operations at home and abroad to prevent further attacks.",
