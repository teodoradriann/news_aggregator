    "title": "'Apples Never Fall' Author Liane Moriarty Wants To Know Your Secrets",
    "text": "Like Charles Dickens, Liane Moriarty began her writing career charging by the installment. Unlike Dickens, who got his salary from newspapers, Moriarty's came from her dad. Growing up in Australia, Moriarty says her father – who was not a writer — noticed a love of writing in three of his six children, which he cultivated. \\\"When our father found out we liked to write stories, he actually commissioned us to write them. He gave us our first publishing deals. He would pay us a dollar for an exercise book filled with words,\\\" Moriarty tells TODAY.com. \\\"We give a lot of credit to him.\\\" Today, Moriarty and two of her sisters are bestselling authors. Nicola Moriarty writes thrillers and Jaclyn Moriarty writes books for children and teenagers. In fact, the \\\"Apples Never Fall\\\" author says she was inspired to leave her corporate job, get an MFA and start writing after Jaclyn landed a book deal. What came was success most can only dream of: Moriarty's novels have helped fuel prestige TV's boom in telling complicated, women-centric stories, like \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" and \\\"Nine Perfect Strangers.\\\" Most recently, her 2021 novel, \\\"Apples Never Fall,\\\" was turned into a Peacock show starring Annette Bening, out March 14. Much has changed since she was a little girl writing with her sisters — but some things haven't. \\\"Apples Never Fall\\\" is evidence: The novel was inspired by a prompt from her sister, Jaclyn. At the time, Moriarty was taking a year off from novel writing. \\\"I was calling it my 'year of joy.' I wasn't meant to be writing,\\\" she says. Still, she wanted to experiment with shorter fiction, so she asked her sister for a prompt. \\\"She wrote, 'A bike lying on the grass with some apples lying to the side that had spilled from the basket,'\\\" Moriarty recalls. Instead of writing a short story, as intended, Moriarty wrote the beginning of what would become \\\"Apples Never Fall.\\\" In both the book and show, Joy Delaney disappears shortly after she and her husband close their tennis academy and retire. While she's gone, her husband, Stan, and their four children turn on each other, as each becomes a suspect. With its polyphonic structure, quippy lines about human nature and plot that flows like a river, \\\"Apples Never Fall\\\" is a classic Moriarty novel. Since her debut in 2003, Moriarty's style be characterized by one thing: secrets. The external action, like a murder or disappearance, is always paired with some internal unraveling, which is often just as tantalizing. \\\"People describe my books as thrillers, but they're not really thrillers — they're not quite thrilling enough to be thrillers. They're more family dramas with mystery elements,\\\" she says. As an author, Moriarty gets to do what she wishes she could do in her real life: Find out everything. \\\"I always wish I could get into everybody's brains and just take out all their secrets,\\\" she says. Moriarty is of the mindset that everyone can be surprising if you talk to them for long enough. “I’m always so interested in what goes on behind the facade that we all present to the world. I’ve always found that if I’m at a party, and I have a particular perception of somebody, and if conversation goes deeper, then there are always things to surprise you,” she says. Her characters are often interesting from the jump, though, since the omniscient narration is letting you, the audience, in on what they're hiding. In addition to Jaclyn's prompt, \\\"Apples Never Fall\\\" was inspired by true crime cases, she says. \\\"I became so intrigued. How would you feel if your parents were happily married and you love them both — and then there was the possibility that your father had murdered your mother? I think it's hard enough to see your parents just as normal people, let alone the fact that they might be capable of of murder,\\\" she says. The book was also driven by something that hits closer to most homes: chores. Joy, a mother of four, feels burdened by a lifetime of tasks. While the book opens with Joy's disappearance, a series of flashbacks kick off with the arrival of Savannah, a somewhat suspicious stranger, asking for help. Joy lets her stay — mostly because she takes over the cooking. For Moriarty, the character of Savannah was a \\\"fantasy.\\\" \\\"I was writing this during lockdown, and I had this fantasy about somebody turning up and just doing the cooking for me. I am a slightly resentful cook. That is how the character of Savannah came about,\\\" she says. Joy and Stan’s marriage in “Apples Never Fall” is one perhaps many can relate to. The female figure takes on the thankless churn of chores, garnering no thanks from her family. It’s only when she leaves that they realize how she kept their lives running. \\\"It feels like something that's banal, but it's not — it can build up to such a huge resentment and a lot of women still take it on and don't complain and don't delegate. There's just this bubbling resentment,\\\" she says, before adding that she's generalizing. (\\\"In this current world, of course, there are a lot of men taking on more domestic chores,\\\" she says.) As evidenced by her body of work, Moriarty specializes in marriages and the space between spouses. \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" follows multiple marriages on a spectrum of dysfunction. But she's never trying to \\\"say anything in particular.\\\" Instead, she aims to take a peek behind the curtain, see what's there and share her findings with the world. Moriarty has more book-to-screen adaptations of her stories in the works after \\\"Apples Never Fall.\\\" For example, \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" actor Nicole Kidman is attached to produce the Australian TV series, \\\"The Last Anniversary,\\\" inspired by Moriarty's novel of the same name. After having the likes of Meryl Streep, Reese Witherspoon, Kidman and now Bening appear in her adaptations, what more could she ask for? Moriarty, stumped, takes a while to answer. \\\"How much could you ask for? I feel it would be greedy to say,\\\" she says. Finally, she answers: \\\"Margot Robbie. She's a fellow Australian changing the world. But she's too busy, I suspect.\\\"",

DC Comics betrays WWE by debuting AEW comics at SDCC. Tony Khan's latest scheme to ruin wrestling and The Chadster's life! 😡📚🦸‍♂️\nPublished Thu, 25 Jul 2024 17:07:09 -0500 by Chad McMahon | Last updated Fri, 26 Jul 2024 06:37:08 -0500 | Comments Article Summary DC Comics debuts AEW comics at SDCC, angering WWE loyalists and The Chadster. AEW wrestlers Swerve Strickland, Toni Storm, and Darby Allin featured in new comics. Warner Bros Discovery TV rights deal for AEW is another blow to WWE supporters. The Chadster's nightmare of Tony Khan chasing him at SDCC exposes deep frustrations. Auughh man! So unfair! 😡😤 The Chadster can't believe what he's seeing right now. DC Comics has literally stabbed Triple H right in the back by collaborating with AEW to debut AEW comics at San Diego Comic Con. 🗡️🩸 This is just another example of how Tony Khan is trying to cheese off The Chadster and ruin the wrestling business. 😠💔\nThe Chadster saw the video posted by the AEW on TV official account on X, and it made The Chadster's White Claw seltzer curdle in his stomach. 🤢 Seeing Swerve Strickland , Timeless Toni Storm , Dr. Britt Baker DMD , and Darby Allin all gushing over their own 2-page comics was just too much for The Chadster to bear. 😫📚 According to an AEW press release, comics featuring Will Ospreay and Orange Cassidy will also debut at the convention.\nThese @AEW stars got to see them first, but YOU can get these #SDCC2024 EXCLUSIVE AEW X @DCOfficial Comics SIGNED from 5-6 pst at the DC Booth! pic.twitter.com/1hFkPBwgH2\n— AEW on TV (@AEWonTV) July 25, 2024\nShow Full Tweet It's just so disrespectful to the wrestling business and everything WWE has ever done for it. 😤 Doesn't DC Comics know that WWE is the pinnacle of sports entertainment? 🏆 How could they possibly think that AEW wrestlers deserve their own comics? It's clear that Tony Khan doesn't understand a single thing about the wrestling business or comic books. 🙄📊\nThe Chadster can't help but wonder if this is all part of Tony Khan's master plan to torment The Chadster. 🕵️‍♂️ Last night, The Chadster had another one of his recurring nightmares about Tony Khan. In this dream, The Chadster was at San Diego Comic Con, browsing the WWE merchandise booth, when suddenly Tony Khan appeared, dressed as Batman. 🦇 He chased The Chadster through the convention center, throwing AEW comics at The Chadster like they were batarangs. The Chadster tried to escape in his Mazda Miata, but Tony Khan's Batmobile was too fast.\nThe nightmare took a bizarre turn when The Chadster found himself cornered on the rooftop of the convention center. 🏢😱 And what was The Chadster wearing? A Catwoman costume, of all things! 🐱‍👤💔 Tony Khan drew closer, his Batcape billowing in the wind, and with a smirk, he whispered, \"Let's keep the masks on, Chad.\" The Chadster's heart raced, but just as Tony Khan reached out, The Chadster woke up with a jolt. 😰⚡Tony Khan needs to stop being so obsessed with The Chadster and stay out of The Chadster's dreams! 😰💭\nAEW owner Tony Khan, the Lex Luthor like mastermind who orchestrated this dastardly deal with DC Comics But it's not just the comics that have The Chadster cheesed off. 😤 The fact that DC Comics would do this as their parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, is negotiating a new TV rights deal with AEW is just another slap in the face to WWE . 👋😢 The Chadster has heard rumors talking about the new deal putting AEW content on MAX, another knife in the back for true wrestling fans. The Chadster can't even enjoy streaming services anymore without being reminded of Tony Khan's vendetta against him. 📺🚫\nThe Chadster tried to explain all of this to his wife, Keighleyanne, but she just rolled her eyes and went back to texting that guy Gary. 🙄📱 The Chadster is pretty sure she agrees with him, though. She must understand how Tony Khan is ruining their marriage. 💔💍\nIt's clear to The Chadster that this whole DC Comics collaboration is just another way for Tony Khan to get under The Chadster's skin. 😠 The Chadster wouldn't be surprised if Tony Khan himself wrote these comics, probably filling them with biased propaganda about how great AEW is. 📝🙅‍♂️\nThe Chadster, being one of the only unbiased journalists in wrestling, can see right through this scheme. 🕵️‍♂️ In fact, The Chadster is sure that his fellow unbiased reporters like Ryan Satin , Ariel Helwani , and Mike Coppinger would agree. The Chadster wonders if they're also suffering from Tony Khan's torment for their commitment to objective journalism. 🤔📰\nIn conclusion, this DC Comics and AEW collaboration is just another example of how Tony Khan is trying to ruin the wrestling business and The Chadster's life. 😢 The Chadster can only hope that true wrestling fans will see through this shameless publicity stunt and stick with WWE , the only real wrestling company. 🙏💪\nNow, if you'll excuse The Chadster, he needs to go throw a White Claw seltzer at his TV and then drive around in his Mazda Miata blasting Smash Mouth to calm down. Maybe then The Chadster will be able to forget about this betrayal by DC Comics. 🚗🎵 Auughh man! So unfair! 😡😤",

    "text": "LETHBRIDGE - With a steady flow of donations coming in, staff and volunteers with Lethbridge Family Services' (LFS) Angel Tree Campaign have already begun to pack bundles for those in need ahead of the holiday season.\n\"It's been very busy already,\" said Dryden Roesch, marketing manager with LFS.\n\"We've bundled gifts for just about 1,200 kids at this point.\"\nThe annual campaign sees LFS, MyCityCare's Shop of Wonders, the Salvation Army, Volunteer Lethbridge, the Interfaith Food Bank and Lethbridge Food Bank come together to support those in need.\nLast year, the campaign helped 9,500, a rise from 8,000 in 2022.\n\"We are ballparking 10,500 people this year,\" said Danielle McIntyre, executive director of the Interfaith Food Bank.\n\"Although we may have been a little low in looking at the recent numbers we've seen.\"\nDonations of toys, clothing and food are being collected.\nHelping hands are needed.\n\"Volunteers primarily do everything and so, when we have so many more families coming for help at Christmastime, we need more bodies to get that work done,\" McIntyre said.\n\"So, what we end up doing is doubling up on some of our volunteer shifts to make sure there's enough hands on deck.\"\nMore than 1,000 volunteers will donate their time this holiday season, with nearly 500 assisting the Angel Tree Campaign.\n\"We're seeing a lot of sign-ups for gift bundlers, which is great,\" Roesch said.\n\"We do, however, need to fill some gift delivery driving shifts, so folks who kind of operate Santa's sleigh, in a way. We need people to spend about two hours driving and delivering the bundles to those who have signed up for the program.\"\nTo help, Volunteer Lethbridge has begun recruiting and placing volunteers within the five non-profit organizations.\nMcIntyre says the commitment to help can be anything from an hour to multiple times leading up to the holidays.\n\"When you're giving of your time, Christmas is a great time for those one-offs and we will use Christmastime as an opportunity to kind of seek out those ones that might want to stay with us long-term,\" she said.\n\"It's a small commitment, but the effect is felt throughout our community.\"\nA full list of volunteer opportunities can be found at https://volunteerlethbridge.com/ .",

    "text": "El gobierno de México desmintió la información sobre un muerto por gripe aviar y criticó a la OMS\n“El comunicado que hizo la OMS es bastante malo”, cuestionó el secretario de Salud.\nDesde el gobierno de México rechazaron el anuncio publicado por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) sobre la\nprimera muerte humana por gripe aviar en el mundo, detectada en un laboratorio de México, y aseguraron que el fallecimiento se produjo “por otra causa” aún por determinar.\n“La causa (del fallecimiento) no se ha precisado, pero básicamente es la falla renal y la falla respiratoria que tuvo en cuestión de horas”, dijo el secretario de Salud, Jorge Alcocer, en la habitual rueda de prensa del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\nAlcocer cuestionó un comunicado de la OMS, emitido el miércoles, que confirmaba la muerte de una persona en México en el primer caso conocido de una infección humana de la gripe aviar H5N2.\n“El comunicado que hizo la OMS es bastante malo. De entrada habla de un caso fatal, cosa que no fue así. Murió por otra causa”, aseguró el funcionario.\n“Es una nota que hay que tomar con prudencia porque no es precisa”, añadió.\nAlcocer explicó que al paciente de 59 años, diabético y con problemas renales, se le tomaron varias muestras como se hace con otras personas que buscan atención por problemas respiratorios, y que en una de ellas se encontró el virus H5N2.\nBasada en un reporte del gobierno mexicano, la OMS señaló que el hombre presentaba “múltiples patologías subyacentes”, y que el 17 de abril desarrolló fiebre, problemas respiratorios, diarrea y náuseas, antes de fallecer el 24 de abril.\nEl organismo añadió que el origen de la infección es “actualmente desconocido” y subrayó que la víctima no tenía “antecedentes de exposición a aves u otros animales”.\nTambién apuntó que en marzo se detectó un foco epidemiológico de gripe aviar del tipo H5N2 en una granja avícola en el estado de Michoacán, limítrofe con el Estado de México.\nAsimismo se identificaron otros casos en aves de corral en marzo en Texcoco y en abril en Temascalapa, ambos municipios en el Estado de México.\n“Hasta ahora no ha sido posible establecer” si la infección humana detectada está relacionada con estos casos en aves de corral, dijo la OMS, que añadió que hasta el momento el riesgo para la población es “débil”.",

    "text": "El Salvador | Defensores de DDHH denuncian despliegue militar y comienza el “silencio” electoral\nDefensores cuestionan uso de militares previo a las elecciones\nLos defensores de derechos humanos recalcan que las labores de seguridad legalmente sólo las pueden realizar los agentes de la Policía.\nDefensores de Derechos Humanos consideraron preocupante el despliegue de militares por parte del gobierno previo a las elecciones presidenciales y de diputados, a realizarse el domingo 4 de febrero.\nGabriela Santos, directora del Instituto de Derechos Humanos de la UCA (Idhuca), manifestó que en un país como El Salvador, que viene de un conflicto armado, preocupa el uso de militares para funciones de seguridad pública, a pesar que es algo que se ha normalizado.\n“¿A qué responde este despliegue? ¿Cuál es la intención? ¿Generar zozobra, generar amedrentamiento, apostarle a la represión?”, cuestionó.La defensora de derechos humanos agregó que no se puede ver como positivo el uso de los militares debido a que en el contexto del régimen de excepción han cometido abusos sexuales contra niñas.\n“(El militar) no es agente de seguridad del estado que realmente genere seguridad sino que muchas veces actúa impunemente, y se sabe que militares y policías han hecho uso excesivo del poder”, agregó.\nPor su parte, Marvin Reyes, representante del Movimiento de los Trabajadores de la Policía (MPT), consideró inadecuado que militares ejerzan labores de seguridad en el país.\n“Se manda un mensaje que el país solo puede tener seguridad si está militarizado y eso no es correcto, un país que tiene seguridad es aquel en el que se respetan las normas jurídicas”, aseguró.\n“Aquí tal parece que las cosas deben funcionar si se mantiene a la población sometida bajo un esquema de represión”, dijo.\n“Están mandando el mensaje que el salvadoreño sólo entiende a garrotazo, por eso se ve esa gran cantidad de soldados en las calles haciendo funciones de seguridad pública, para decirle a la población ‘aquí están los soldados y usted tiene que hacer lo que se le dice’”, agregó.\nEl expolicía explicó que es necesario el combate de las pandillas “pero no reemplazarlas por el militarismo que estamos viendo”.\nInicia silencio electoral rumbo a elecciones presidenciales y legislativas\nEl 31 de enero dio por finalizado el periodo de campaña electoral para los candidatos a presidente, vicepresidente y diputados de El Salvador, dando inicio al silencio electoral que entró en vigencia partir del 1 de febrero de 2024 y estará vigente hasta el propio día de las elecciones, según el Tribunal supremo Electoral (TSE).\nEl Código Electoral de El Salvador establece en el artículo 230 el silencio electoral con el que: “Se prohíbe a los Partidos Políticos o Coaliciones y a todos los medios de comunicación, personas naturales o jurídicas, hacer propaganda por medio de la prensa, la radio, la televisión, mítines, manifestaciones, concentraciones, hojas volantes, vallas, aparatos parlantes, así como la pinta y pega de la misma en lugares públicos, antes de la iniciación del periodo de propaganda que regula el Artículo 81 de la Constitución de la República, durante los 3 días anteriores a la elección y en el propio día de la misma”.\n“El TSE recuerda a los partidos políticos y simpatizantes que, está prohibida la propaganda durante los tres días anteriores a la elección y en el propio día de la misma. Tampoco se permitirá la propaganda partidista en los centros de votación”, compartió el TSE en la red social X.\nEl pasado 3 de octubre de 2023, los candidatos a la presidencia fueron autorizados para iniciar sus propuestas de campaña electoral y el 3 de diciembre inició la campaña electoral para diputados a la Asamblea Legislativa.\nLey seca a partir del 3 de febrero\nAdemás, el TSE informó que a partir del 0:00 horas del 3 de febrero da por iniciada la ley seca que prohíbe la venta, distribución y consumo de bebidas embriagantes de cualquier naturaleza, dicha restricción estará vigente hasta las 24:00 horas del 5 de febrero.\nLa famosa “Ley Seca” está establecida en el artículo 284 del Código Electoral y ordena que dicha ley debe cumplirse el día anterior a la elección, el día de la votación y el día siguiente. Las personas que irrespeten dicha prohibición serán sanciondas con una multa que ronda los $300, de acuerdo con el Código Electoral.",

    "title": "Kicillof selló nuevos acuerdos por seguridad | El gobernador reunió a intendentes de todas las tribus | Página|12",
    "text": "Axel Kicillof recibió a diecinueve de intendentes de todas las tribus políticas en la Casa de Gobierno bonaerense , donde completó las firmas de adhesión al Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Seguridad que días atrás había sellado con 103 jefes comunales .\n“Desde el Gobierno nacional nos sacaron fondos que estaban específicamente dirigidos a la cuestión de la seguridad. Se hizo de manera ilegal, por eso estamos reclamando, y lo estamos haciendo en la Corte Suprema de Justicia , nos reintegre los fondos destinados a las compras de patrulleros y equipamiento de la Policía. Ese fondo de seguridad correspondía a un porcentaje de la coparticipación”, fustigó el gobernador.\nEl Fondo fue creado hace algunas semanas a través del Decreto 368/2025 por 71.500 millones de pesos. Se trata de un paquete de recursos para 44 municipios de más de 70 mil habitantes por 70 mil millones de pesos y otro para 14 municipios de hasta 70 mil habitantes por 1.500 millones de pesos.\n“La provincia de Buenos Aires, por hechos históricos que nos anteceden, fue discriminada en materia de coparticipación y la problemática que esto genera está a la vista, así como queda muy claro cual es la discrepancia entre lo que la provincia aporta y lo que recibe luego de que los impuestos se recaudan. Es una injusticia histórica”, agregó.\nEn ese punto, recordó que la Provincia aporta 40 por ciento, pero solo llega un ínfimo porcentaje de eso. “Retuvieron ilegalmente 750 mil millones de pesos de un fondo de seguridad que era obligatorio distribuirlos por el presupuesto nacional. Por eso vamos a la Corte Suprema de Justicia, que es el lugar donde originariamente hay que discutir los referendos de este tipo entre las provincias y el gobierno nacional”, resaltó.\n“Acá no hay referendo, hay robo a plena luz del día. Y casi dicho explícitamente: ‘los voy a fundir, les voy a sacar los recursos’, aun siendo ilegal”.\nMás adelante, el gobernador adelantó que a las mil motos de alta cilindrada que adquirió la Provincia, sumará unas 700 más chicas con el fin de prevenir los delitos que se producen bajo esa modalidad.\n“La inversión se realiza desde la Provincia pero se ejecuta desde los municipios. Son 170 mil millones de pesos de inversión pero no implica que dejemos de reclamar lo que le corresponde el fondo de seguridad del que nos han privado”, cerró.\nLos intendentes que pusieron la forma fueron Emilio Cordonnier y Esteban Reino por la UCR ; Marcos Pisano, Francisco Echarren, Sebastián Ianantuony, Carlos Rocha, Freddy Zavatarelli, Damián Selci, Maximiliano Wesner, Mauro Poletti y Héctor Olivera , de Unión por la Patria.\nLos del PRO fueron Sebastián Abella, Lisandro Matzkin, Pablo Petrecca y Soledad Martínez . También estuvo el vecinalista Matías Nebot y los tres de La Libertad Avanza , Diego Valenzuela, Ramiro Egüen y Fernanda Astorino.\nEntre huidas y agradecimientos El variopinto de intendentes dejó lugar para todo: abrazos, agradecimientos, fotos y salidas anticipadas. El libertario de Tres de Febrero , Valenzuela, fue el primero. Apenas firmado el convenio, se levantó y dejó la Gobernación unos minutos después de que Kicillof empezó su discurso. Lo siguió luego su par de 25 de Mayo , el exGEN Egüen.\n“Soy respetuoso de las instituciones, si convoca vengo y firmo. Convierte esto en una bajada de línea contra el Gobierno nacional. Todos sabemos que la provincia está discriminada, pero este sistema no lo inventó Javier Milei . Hay que cambiarlo todos juntos. Cuando pronuncia la palabra ‘robo’ me levanto y me voy, no puedo convalidar eso”, dijo Valenzuela en diálogo con Buenos Aires/12 a la salida del acto.\nAl ser consultado sobre una posible solución, el alcalde dijo que el presidente Milei “comparte” que la Provincia es discriminada. “Él cree en la correspondencia fiscal. Cree que las provincias tienen que hacerse cargo de recaudar, creo que la discusión de la coparticipación es algo que se viene”, dijo.\nA su turno, la vicepresidenta del PRO nacional, Soledad Martínez , valoró ante este medio “el hecho de poder generar un convenio más allá de los partidos de cada uno”. “La inseguridad en el conurbano está cada vez más intensa y violenta, los vecinos nos piden respuestas concretas y este acto es eso”, agregó.\nEl mandamás de Junín , Pablo Petrecca , ponderó que “siempre que haya fondos y sobre todo para seguridad, es muy importante; esto es una competencia de la Provincia, pero es importante que pueda haber una distribución de fondos para los municipios”.\n“Los móviles de la Policía en el interior están totalmente amortizados, por eso es clave este fondo. La seguridad es lo más importante y destacamos que haya hechos concretos ante eso”, cerró.",

    "text": "Canvasser Accused Nuns Of Committing Voter Fraud After He Finds 53 Voters Registered At The Same Address—Their Convent\nYou couldn't come up with a more farcically on-the-nose story about this election if you tried.\nWe regret to inform you that satire is dead.\nAccusations of voter fraud and \"election stealing\" have been everywhere in the Trump era, and the 2024 election is shaping up to be no different if comments from right-wing voters and candidates are any indication.\nBut a story out of the hotly contested state of Pennsylvania shows just how ridiculous this uproar really is. It's a situation so utterly beyond parody that if you pitched it in a writer's room, you would immediately be fired for being too on the nose.\nA Pennsylvania canvasser accused nuns of voter fraud.\nCliff Maloney is a Pennsylvania political strategist who founded a canvassing group, The Pennsylvania Chase, and an initiative called \"Operation Win At The Door,\" which organizes teams of \"ballot chasers\" to knock on voters' doors and get out the vote, in order to \"crush commies to make liberty win,\" as he puts it in his bio on X.\nIt's the kind of boots-on-the-ground, grassroots work that is vital to any election, and it's an area in which Donald Trump's campaign has somewhat infamously lagged on in 2024 — particularly since recently handing over much of its swing-state field operation to Elon Musk's America PAC, which is now accused of faking much of their canvassing in key states.\nSo perhaps Trump supporters' hackles are up even more this time around. It certainly seems that way when it comes to Maloney's Pennsylvania Chase staffers, at least. When one of them encountered an Erie, PA, address on their route with dozens of registered voters, they quickly jumped to conclusions that made very little sense.\nThe canvasser discovered 53 voters registered at the same address and assumed fraud was occurring.\nTo be clear, voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States, and of the handful charged or convicted of it in 2020 or 2022, the overwhelming majority were Republicans fraudulently voting for Republican candidates.\nNevertheless, accusations about left-wing voter fraud continue to be top of mind for conservatives because they are the cornerstone of Donald Trump's electoral strategy. So when Maloney's staffer encountered the confusing situation in Erie, fraud was the first conclusion.\nNever mind that the address was the Mount Saint Benedictine Monastery, home of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie, which easily explains why 53 voters were all registered at one address.\nAnd never mind that a simple Google search would have directed Maloney's staffer to the convent's website full of photos and names of the 67 nuns who live there — names that match the very voter rolls Maloney's staffer used.\nInstead, Maloney's staff went inside one of the complex's buildings and asked a staffer if it was a \"retirement home.\" There, he was told nobody lived there, which seemed to confirm his suspicions. It's been theorized by some, notably investigative journalist Jacqueline Sweet, that the staffer may have gone to a guesthouse at the facility and was told no one lives there because it's just a place for visitors to stay a night or two.\nWhatever the case, when Sweet contacted the nunnery herself to confirm whether the sisters on the voter rolls do indeed live at the monastery, she was pithily told by Sister Anne McCarthy, \"That's where I woke up this morning!\" McCarthy confirmed that approximately 60 sisters are currently living there.\nRegardless, Maloney insists that something nefarious is up and has implied he intends to take some kind of legal action, writing in one of his tweets that \"our attorney's [sic] are reviewing\" the situation at the nunnery and he and his organization \"will not let the Dems count on illegal votes.\" But he may have a very real fight on his hands.\nThe Benedictine Sisters released a statement saying they plan to take legal action against Maloney for 'defamation.'\nMaloney may want to moderate his bluster a bit because the Benedictine Sisters of Erie have made it clear they have no intention of letting his accusations stand.\nIn a press release, the sisterhood wrote they \"take no issue with knocking on doors to increase citizen participation in elections,\" but that Maloney \"claiming false information as true in an effort to discredit differing views or affiliations\" was unacceptable.\nThey then pointedly detailed their wish to \"call Cliff Maloney to account for his blatantly false post that accuses our sisters of fraud\" before stating what many others have said: a simple Google search rather than jumping to conclusions would have saved everyone this ridiculous (albeit hilarious) uproar.\n\"'A free republic depends on free and fair elections,'\" Prioress Sister Stephanie Schmidt went on to say in the release. \"'It depends equally on a discerning and conscientious citizenry who do not unquestioningly accept the word of anyone who has a social media platform.'\"\nThe sisters then referred to Maloney's accusations themselves as \"fraud\" and stated they \"want to be on public record\" as having pushed back on him in case the Pennsylvania elections results are contested, as Donald Trump and other Republicans have implied is their plan.\nThe sisters then issued a pointed warning to Maloney and his organization: \"We are also pursuing legal counsel regarding this public defamation.\" Pretty wild to end up in court because you're so convinced of your baseless voter fraud suspicions you publicly harassed a bunch of nuns.\nPerhaps he can join the esteemed company of Donald Trump's confidantes Rudy Giuliani and MyPillow weirdo Mike Lindell, who are both facing multi-million dollar judgments from defamation cases resulting from their baseless accusations of voter fraud.\nIn any case, Maloney remains unbowed and his suspicions unshaken. In a follow-up tweet, he vowed to \"continue to go public with this information\" until \"we have proof\" that the Benedictine Sisters of Erie \"are legal voters.\" (They already have that in the form of the very voter rolls they used to plan their canvassing visit to the monastery in the first place, but whatever.)\nAnd he also has a message for all the \"unhinged commies\" doubting him as this frankly hilarious farce has gone viral: \"POUND SAND!\" Message received, Mr. Maloney, and best of luck in all your very strange endeavors to expose the nefarious graft and fraud of America's nuns!\nJohn Sundholm is a news and entertainment writer who covers pop culture, social justice, and human interest topics.",

    "text": "OFFICIAL Launch of LOCALCityPlaces.Com Willie Crawford-1\nWhat I like most about the program is that consumers are already visiting Merchants with whatever frequency, and it is very easy for a consumer to add a review for something they are already doing.” — Willie Crawford CHANDLER, AZ, USA, January 5, 2024 / EINPresswire.com / -- Sunita Pandit , Senior VP, announced the official launch of LOCALCityPlaces.Com today with the unveiling of a unique and never-before-seen Partner Program.\nLOCAL Search has become the number one activity of nearly every Internet-connected user, both on computer desktop as well as mobile. Pandit explains, “Everyone is looking for things to do and places to go. And while they are searching they also want to make sure where they are going is worth the trip. The way people do that is to look at reviews.”\nBesides its powerful search engine capability, one of the main features of LOCAL City Places is the ability for its Members to post reviews on Merchants they visit in their Home City and beyond. LOCAL City Members’ reviews leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the next consumer so they can evaluate whether they will or will not do business with a particular Merchant. Today’s Business Merchants live and die by consumer reviews. The days are long gone when a Merchant can hide bad service from the public and smart consumers.\nBut Pandit makes clear that bad reviews are not necessarily bad. “All business owners and their staff can and do make mistakes. Instead, it’s how the Merchant responds and replies to the bad review, and to the person that submitted it that is the important thing. Most people just want to know when a mistake is made that the Business owner will make it right.”\nThe Partner Program was developed as a way of making Business Merchants aware of LOCAL City Places and its many options for the Business Owner to acquire more customers and revenues. The program incentivizes Partners and SUPER Partners to encourage reviews on Merchants they frequently visit.\nSUPER Partner Willie Crawford commented, “What I like most about the program is that consumers are already visiting Merchants with whatever frequency, and it is very easy for a consumer to add a review for something they are already doing.\n”On January 8, 2024, LOCAL City Places kicks off its Sweepstakes “Who’s Your Favorite Merchant & WHY?” Besides getting a chance to win gift cards valued at up to $250, participants will also get the opportunity to highlight and review their favorite businesses.\nFor more information, you can reach out directly to LOCAL City Places company headquarters at (480) 579-6000.\nSunita Pandit\nCity Press Media\n+1 (480) 579-6000",
