    "text": "Submitted Joseph Nolan and his wife Blair bought the former Clear River Tavern in Pittsfield. By Katy Savage About two years ago, Joseph Nolan and his wife Blair were sitting on a coach in their home in North Carolina jotting ideas on paper, dreaming of menu items for a restaurant they hoped to own someday. “I would have ideas and she would write them down,” Joseph said. Now, their dream is coming true. The Toasted Pecan, a southern-inspired restaurant, opened Dec. 20 in Pittsfield, in the building of the former Clear River Tavern, which closed in November. “It feels great to have it come alive,” Joseph said. “I’m so humbled by this experience.” Joseph started his first restaurant job at age 16. He worked at a Sicilian restaurant in North Carolina and quickly knew it was what he wanted to do. “I just love cooking,” he said. “ I love when I make a dish and it makes people happy.” Joseph most recently worked at a conference center, managing 80 people. “I dreamed of owning my own place,” he said. “I never thought it would happen. It’s something as a chef you work toward your whole life. When you work for someone else you tend not to have full creative freedom.” Blair, meanwhile, has a background in events, gaining experience first as a hostess at a restaurant while she was in college. The pair moved to Stockbridge two years ago in an attempt to enroll their 8-year-old in a better school system. They quickly fell in love with the community. “We were looking for a smaller public school, smaller classrooms, more community feel, and just kind of how I was raised in the south,” Blair said. Blair, who grew up in Washington, North Carolina said the area was no longer the small town she grew up in and the weather was too hot. “I did a lot of research on where we should move,” she said. They bought a house in Stockbridge from Mark Stugart, who was coincidentally the owner of the Clear River Tavern. They purchased the restaurant after considering their options. “We were like, Oh, my gosh, this is it,” Blair said. “What was really it for us was the view.” They wanted a place to have outdoor weddings. The Toasted Pecan menu features Southern dishes with a New England twist. The menu includes Vermont made products, like jellies, jams and maple syrup. Menu items include apple butter grilled cheese and shrimp and grits — an ingredient they are getting from a supplier in North Carolina since they can’t find grits in Vermont. The restaurant is a family business that they hope their 8-year old and 15-month-old can grow into. They want to build a family-friendly atmosphere for customers. “We have little ones,” Blair said. “That’s what we were looking for. There was a need there for us. And we talked to community members and there was a need for the community as well.” The restaurant is open for dinner starting at 4 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and at 10 a.m. for brunch Saturday and Sunday. The Nolans aren’t turning back. “We love this community and this is my last stop,” Joseph said. “I’m not moving anywhere else.” The post New restaurant, Toasted Pecan, is now open in Pittsfield appeared first on The Mountain Times .",

    "text": "«Une vie»: Anthony Hopkins est émouvant L’histoire vraie de Sir Nicholas Winton est peu connue et c’est bien dommage. Car l’homme, incarné jeune par Johnny Flynn et vieux par Anthony Hopkins, a sauvé pas moins de 669 enfants tchécoslovaques lors de l’occupation du pays par les nazis. Une vie s’ouvre sur la nécessité, pour Winton, de faire du tri dans les montagnes de papier de son bureau. Dans l’un des tiroirs, une vieille sacoche en cuir à laquelle il tient furieusement. À grand renfort de flash-backs, on apprend ainsi que le jeune Winton, alors qu’il était employé de banque, a décidé de tout faire pour venir en aide aux enfants tchécoslovaques, majoritairement juifs, en danger de mort suite à l’invasion du pays par l’armée hitlérienne. Winton se rend ainsi à Prague pendant que sa mère (Helena Bonham-Carter) se bat contre l’administration britannique qui ne veut rien entendre. Organiser le transport, en train, des enfants est pour le moins périlleux dans une Europe en guerre, les difficultés pour leur trouver des familles d’accueil en Angleterre sont nombreuses, tout comme le fait d’obtenir de l’argent pour parrainer les jeunes. Mais Winton y parvient et, à la fin de sa vie, il aura l’occasion de retrouver certains des enfants – adultes – qu’il a sauvés d’une mort certaine. Habitué de la télévision britannique, le réalisateur James Hawes traite le sujet à la manière convenue d’un téléfilm satisfaisant. Mais cela n’enlève rien à l’émotion ressentie lors de certaines scènes – oui, vous pouvez sortir vos mouchoirs – et aux très bonnes prestations d’Anthony Hopkins et d’Helena Bonham-Carter.

    "title": "Mizzou professor, a centrist on climate change, loses weather page to Facebook removal",
    "text": "Atmospheric scientist and University of Missouri Professor Anthony Lupo recently discovered the Midwest Missouri Weather page he maintained on Facebook for more than five years had “vanished” with no clear indication of why.\nThe scholar told The College Fix it was taken down after he debated a follower regarding whether the Show-Me State’s busy tornado season was due to La Niña or climate change.\n“Sunday morning I found that my personal Facebook account was locked, and I had a message from Meta … to show me how to unlock my account, which I did,” Lupo said in a recent telephone interview regarding the disappearance of the page earlier this month.\nAfter he unlocked his account on June 8, he said he “found that the weather page was gone.”\nAmong Lupo’s initial suppositions for why the page was taken down was that one or more of his posts may have been flagged by another user, or an algorithm, for referencing climate change as part of larger discussions regarding Missouri weather.\nHowever, Lupo acknowledged he does not have more than circumstantial evidence of this, as Facebook did not provide him with a reason for why the page was taken down.\nHe said the page offered weather forecasts, and also sometimes summarized Missouri climate and the seasonal climate.\n“Occasionally, when I’ve done that, I got messages about violating community standards,” Lupo said, adding that this baffled him as the page was “just summarizing numbers.”\n“I would get this warning that your post may violate community standards and that would appear on the page itself for a short time,” he said.\nHe said it was confusing, as he was just informing people whether the temperature was above or below normal, almost saying nothing about climate change itself.\nBut shortly before his weather page disappeared, Lupo said he made a post regarding why this year’s tornado season seemed to be so busy, citing the La Niña year, which typically produces stormier weather in some regions.\nHowever, Lupo said another user who previously had used the comments section to present his own views pushed back against Lupo’s claims, attributing this year’s increased tornado count to climate change as an alternative explanation.\nHe described it as a mildly “combative” interaction but not overtly hostile or impolite. Yet the timing suggests it might have prompted the page’s removal, he told The Fix.\nAsked about his thoughts on climate change’s role in tornadic activity, Lupo said that although he does not believe it should be completely dismissed, there are other factors that need to be considered.\nThis year’s busy season he said is “probably a combination of La Niña [and] some longer term cycles.”\n“How climate change fits in with tornadoes is difficult to say because tornadoes are notoriously difficult to gauge trends by,” he added. “To count tornadoes you got to have somebody to see it. So, if you look at tornado numbers, they’re generally biased to where you have a [large] population and-or radars.”\n“A hundred years ago,” he noted, “the weather bureau thought that [the] normal amount of tornadoes in the United States was 100. Today we know it’s 1200.” This, he said, is partly because we have more people, as well as new technologies.\nIn a later email to The Fix he wrote it would be fair to call him a centrist on many climate change issues more broadly, as he does not want to discount human contributions to climate change, but also does not believe those contributions are the only factors at play.\nRegarding the disappearance of his weather page, Lupo stated he also is open to alternative explanations that have nothing to do with the content of the page. For example, he said he believes it is possible that the page may have been taken down because another website archived some of his old posts without his permission and there may have been some confusion on Facebook’s part regarding the authenticity of his page.\nAdditionally, Lupo wrote in an email to The Fix that he received a notification from Meta that someone attempted to access his personal account from another state. Yet, it remains unclear why this would lead to his weather page being taken down and why he did not regain access to it once he had cleared up the matter.\nThe College Fix reached out to Meta via email regarding the disappearance of Lupo’s Midwest Missouri Weather Page, as well as with questions regarding whether downplaying the role of climate change in increased tornadic activity or having old Facebook posts archived by a third party could result in the removal of a Facebook page. Meta did not reply.\nIn November 2022, Meta released a pair of posts regarding the company’s approach to climate content and alleged climate misinformation, as well as the company’s broader efforts to combat climate change more broadly.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the kinds of posts Lupo described himself as making would have constituted “climate misinformation,” according to Meta’s 2022 posts or the company’s current “misinformation” policy . It is also unclear whether such posts would lead to the removal of a page according to current penalties for sharing “fact-checked” information.\nEarlier this year Meta announced , as part of an effort to allow more free speech and decrease needless censorship, it would end third-party fact checking on its platforms in the United States, transition to a Community Notes program akin to what is found on X, and limit the use of certain policy enforcement tools to the most severe violations entailing acts such as terrorism, child exploitation, and scams.\nMORE: UWashington ‘land based healing panel’ explores ‘decolonial work’\nIMAGE CAPTION AND CREDIT: Professor Anthony Lupo and an image of a tornado / Headshot, courtesy photo, weather image by Grok\nRead More",

    "text": "Córdoba se ha contagiado de ilusión y fantasía en la noche más mágica del año. No es para menos, pues los tres Reyes Magos se han presentado un año más en la ciudad con toda su colorida parafernalia navideña y, como manda la tradición, la expectación ha sido máxima. Pequeños y adultos, unos con los nervios a flor de piel y otros rememorando aquellos nostálgicos y dulces tiempos de inocencia, han llenado las calles de sentimiento en\nuna cabalgata de 2024 que ya queda para el recuerdo.\nY sí, aunque todos los años pasa por la ciudad esta comitiva que tanto aman los más pequeños, la de este 2024 parece que ha gustado más. Quizás por haber sido la primera organizada por Grupo Mundo (empresa responsable, entre otras, de la Málaga) o bien porque simplemente se ha acertado con la temática elegida. La realidad es que son muchos los cordobeses que han catalogado el desfile como \"el mejor de los últimos años\". En los anteriores, el desfile había recibido fuertes críticas por parte de los ciudadanos y para esta edición, el Ayuntamiento decidió contratar la organización de forma privada y elevar el presupuesto: de 121.000 euros en 2023 a 444.000 euros en 2024.\nAsí lo han manifestado los asistentes consultados por El Día y exactamente con esas palabras ha calificado toda la comitiva una de las familias presentes en la plaza de Santa Teresa. \"Mucho mejor que el año pasado que fue más aburrida. Tiene más bandas, más carrozas y está mucho más currada\", ha destacado María, la abuela de la familia, a quien lo que más le ha gustado es \"ese estilo tradicional\" con el que han caracterizado a varios personajes y carruajes.\n\"Lo que más me ha gustado es que bailaban mucho\", ha añadido la pequeña de la familia. Razón no le ha faltado, pues entre carroza y carroza, varios grupos de danza han aportado dinamismo a esta cabalgata. Uno de esos grupos de baile lo han formado 19 jóvenes de la escuela Carmina Nadal Ballet, de Alcoy, que han representado a las vestales del rey Gaspar. Así lo ha explicado su directora, quien se ha mostrado \"muy contenta por venir a una Córdoba que es preciosa\" y a este desfile al que espera \"volver el año que viene\".\nRepresentaciones de animales, superhéroes, medusas gigantes, bailes de todo tipo... y por supuesto, las carrozas de los tres Reyes Magos que han desfilado desde las 17:00 de la tarde por toda Córdoba. En total, 14 carrozas que han protagonizado esta mágica cabalgata que también ha contado con tres bandas de música, cinco pasacalles, un grupo de baúles y la Guardia Real para cada una de sus majestades, además de la colaboración del Hospital Reina Sofía de Córdoba, la Guardia Civil, la Policía Nacional, los bomberos y los carteros de Correos.\nEn total, las 700 personas participantes han partido desde el puente del Arenal con el objetivo claro de repartir felicidad y anunciar la tan esperada llegada de los Reyes Magos a la ciudad. Lo han hecho, como no podía ser de otra forma, lanzando alrededor de 16.500 estuches de cera para colorear, 26.000 pulseras infantiles, 21.875 varitas de pompas de jabón, 16.800 juguetes, 2.100 bolsas de gusanitos, 14.250 kilos de un surtido de golosinas, unas 1.000 libretas, bolígrafos, auriculares, lámparas y cepillos de dientes.\nEl cuerpo de Bomberos de Córdoba se ha encargado de repartir los peluches que el pasado jueves recogió -lanzados por los aficionados- durante el partido entre el Córdoba CF y el Real Madrid Castilla. Las bandas de música del Cristo del Amor, Sagrada Cena y La Estrella han cumplido con creces su labor de ponerle sonido al agradable desfile y los Reyes Magos, pues poco han tenido que hacer más allá de lanzar caramelos lo más lejos posible y saludar a toda la masa de cordobeses que, expectantes, les han pedido que \"por favor\" pasen por su casa esta noche.\nEn la carroza del rey Melchor, que este año ha sido la enfermera del Materno-Infantil María Dolores Manjón la encargada de darle vida tras haber ganado el sorteo del Ayuntamiento, esta mágica noche la han afrontado \"con muchas ganas, alegría e ilusión\". Así lo ha confirmado una de los pajes reales, quien ha destacado la felicidad que le da ver \"a los niños súper contentos cantando y pasándoselo bien\".\nTambién quiso ser rey Melchor este año Carlos Rodríguez, pues fue uno de los 300 participantes en el sorteo municipal. Aunque no tuvo la suerte de salir elegido, no se ha querido perder la cabalgata: \"Me han parecido muy bonitas las carrozas y su decoración. No sobra nada, es clásica y da mucha alegría, mucho mejor que la del año pasado. Un éxito de cabalgata\", ha subrayado Carlos subido a la fuente de la plaza de Santa Teresa, quien también ha agradecido \"que alguien reconocida como Macarena Gómez sea el rey Gaspar\".\nPrecisamente la actriz cordobesa ha sido una de las protagonistas de la noche más mágica del año en Córdoba que ha reunido a miles de personas en sus calles. Ha estado continuamente aclamada por el público, al igual que Baltasar -encarnado por Sebastián Madrid, de la Peña Coro Alminar-.\nEso sí, toda fiesta tiene su fin y ya entrada la noche en la avenida de las Ollerías, con algo de retraso sobre lo previsto, culminó una Cabalgata 2024 memorable para muchos, aunque ahí no quedó todo. Y es que, en carruajes, los magos se dirigieron al Alpargate para representar la adoración al Niño Jesús, otra de las grandes novedades de este año.\nEntre tanta expectación, y como ocurre con todo, para otros no ha sido tan espectacular. Algunas jóvenes como Clara Márquez, que ha visto la comitiva frente al parque de Colón, o como Marta en la avenida Vallellano, han protestado por la \"falta de caramelos\" y \"porque ha faltado ambiente y música entre carroza y carroza\". No siempre llueve a gusto de todos, pero lo importante ya se ha cumplido:\nlos Reyes Magos han llegado a Córdoba con la intención de hacer felices a todos los cordobeses que hayan sido buenos este año.",

    "text": "TEHRAN — Thousands massed on Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike.\nThe crowd in Tehran's central Imam Hossein square chanted \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America\".\nIsrael has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi's killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Hamas-Israel conflict since early October.\nIranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday killed Moussavi, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arms, the Quds Force, near the Syrian capital Damascus.\nThe Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier on Thursday met with Moussavi's family and led a prayer over the slain general's body before it was taken to the square.\nMany of the mourners were waving yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent”, a reference to Israel.\nThe head of the Guards, Hossein Salami, hailed Moussavi as “one of the most experienced and effective IRGC commanders in the Axis of Resistance”, Tehran-aligned armed groups in the Middle East.\nSalami praised Moussavi for his key role after a former Quds Force commander, the revered Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Soleimani had run the Guards’ foreign operations for more than a decade.\nIRGC spokesman Ramezan Sharif warned on Wednesday that “our response to Moussavi’s assassination will be a combination of direct action as well as [from]others led by the Axis of Resistance”.\nSharif charged that Israel’s killing of the general “was likely due to its failures” when Palestinian Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on October 7.",

    "text": "Reinel Martínez, visionario fundador y actual CEO, nos cuenta cómo el traslado y la ampliación de la nueva planta en el municipio de Mosquera marcó un antes y un después para Tesla transformadores; esto hizo más sólida e innovadora su infraestructura, ampliando la capacidad productiva, para posicionarse como uno de líderes en el mercado. \"El traslado a la planta de Mosquera Cundinamarca no solo amplió nuestras capacidades productivas, sino que nos permitió crear una infraestructura robusta y una línea de producción innovadora\", indica Martínez. Es aquí donde la empresa da vida a transformadores secos encapsulados en resina epóxica, una solución que combina eficiencia y durabilidad, ofreciendo una novedosa alternativa a sus clientes nacionales e internacionales.\nCon el tiempo, el compromiso de Tesla Transformadores con la calidad se reafirmó aún más al obtener en el año 2002 la prestigiosa certificación ISO 9001 por primera vez. \"Este logro continúa vigente a través de los años, lo que confirma nuestra dedicación con la excelencia y nos ha impulsado a expandirnos\", dice Martínez con orgullo.\nLa oferta de Tesla Transformadores es tan variada como impresionante. Desde transformadores de media tensión hasta aquellos diseñados para data centers (instalaciones donde se alojan todos los datos de las empresas), cada producto refleja la alta calidad que caracteriza a la marca. La empresa se apoya en materia prima de proveedores reconocidos, tanto nacionales como internacionales; y en un equipo humano altamente calificado y capacitado, lo que garantiza soluciones energéticas confiables y sostenibles .\nPero Tesla Transformadores no se detiene ahí. Su participación en proyectos de energías renovables ha sido notable. \"Hemos colaborado en la instalación de mini granjas solares y proyectos de mayor envergadura, ofreciendo soluciones innovadoras que han transformado el mapa energético del país\", explica Martínez. La capacidad de la empresa para cumplir con plazos ajustados ha sido clave en su éxito, consolidándose como un actor relevante en el desarrollo de soluciones sostenibles.\nLa innovación es el motor de Tesla Transformadores. Con una inversión de dos millones de dólares en la automatización de su planta, han modernizado su proceso de fabricación, incorporando tecnología de punta como cortadoras láser y dobladoras CNC. \"Esto no solo mejora la eficiencia, también nos posiciona en un mercado global competitivo\", asegura Martínez.\nMirando hacia el futuro, Tesla Transformadores tiene grandes planes. A nivel nacional, aspiran a liderar el camino en proyectos de energías renovables, mientras que a nivel internacional se busca fortalecer y ampliar la presencia en los mercados de América Latina y Estados Unidos. Gracias a alianzas estratégicas con Procolombia y la Universidad de los Andes, entre otros están trazando un plan que les permitirá llevar sus innovadoras soluciones a nuevos horizontes.\nPero lo que realmente distingue a Tesla Transformadores no es solo la calidad de sus productos, sino su compromiso con la responsabilidad social. \"Con más de 185 profesionales nos consideramos embajadores de la ingeniería colombiana y estamos dedicados al desarrollo sostenible del país y de los demás mercados internacionales\", concluye Martínez.\nEn Tesla Transformadores , la energía no solo fluye, sino que se transforma en un futuro más brillante y sostenible.\nTesla Transformadores / Contenido patrocinado",
