    "text": "The Enigmatic Enceladus: A Moon with a Hidden Ocean In the vast expanse of our solar system, Saturn’s moon Enceladus stands out as a captivating celestial body. While it may appear small and icy, this moon harbors a secret that has captivated scientists and ignited imaginations worldwide: a vast, hidden ocean beneath its icy shell. A Moon of Contrasts Enceladus is a world of stark contrasts. Its surface is covered in a pristine layer of ice, reflecting sunlight with dazzling brilliance. This icy landscape is punctuated by towering cliffs, deep canyons, and smooth plains, sculpted by geological processes that remain a mystery. Beneath this icy facade, however, lies a warm, salty ocean, hinting at the possibility of life beyond Earth. The Discovery of Enceladus’s Ocean The existence of Enceladus’s ocean was first hinted at by the Cassini spacecraft, which observed water vapor plumes erupting from the moon’s south polar region. These plumes, spewing from cracks in the icy surface, are a clear indication of liquid water beneath. Further evidence came from gravitational measurements, which suggested a denser interior than expected for a purely icy body. The plumes themselves are a remarkable phenomenon. They contain not only water vapor but also organic molecules, salts, and silica, all of which are essential ingredients for life as we know it. This discovery has transformed Enceladus into one of the most promising targets in the search for extraterrestrial life. A Potential Habitat for Life The presence of liquid water and organic molecules, coupled with the moon’s internal heat, creates a potentially habitable environment. Although the ocean is likely to be very cold and under immense pressure, it could provide a niche for life to thrive. Scientists are particularly interested in the possibility of hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor, similar to those found on Earth, which could provide energy for life. Exploring Enceladus: Future Missions The discovery of Enceladus’s ocean has spurred a wave of scientific interest, leading to the planning of future missions to explore this fascinating world. The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently developing a mission called Enceladus Orbilander, which aims to orbit the moon and deploy a lander to its surface. The mission would collect samples of the plumes and analyze them for signs of life. Other missions are also being considered, including a possible joint mission between NASA and ESA. These missions will provide invaluable insights into Enceladus’s ocean, its potential for life, and the evolution of icy moons in our solar system. Enceladus: A Window into the Universe Enceladus is a testament to the incredible diversity of our solar system. This small, icy moon, with its hidden ocean and the potential for life, challenges our assumptions about the conditions necessary for life to arise. As we continue to explore this intriguing world, we may uncover answers to some of the most fundamental questions about life in the universe. Key Takeaways - Enceladus is a moon of Saturn with a vast, hidden ocean beneath its icy surface. - The ocean is thought to be warm, salty, and potentially habitable. - Water vapor plumes erupting from the south polar region provide evidence of the ocean and contain organic molecules. - Future missions are planned to explore Enceladus and search for signs of life.",

    "text": "Children exposed to traffic-related air pollution show seasonal changes in their nasal bacteria, with winter pollution driving a shift toward less diverse, and potentially more harmful, microbial communities.\nStudy: Short-term personal exposure to multiple air pollutants affects nasal microbiota in school-age children. Image Credit: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock\nRespiratory diseases are common in school-age children and are worsened by air pollution. Pollution-induced changes in the nasal microbiome may mediate this. A recent paper in the journal Science of the Total Environment reports that the nasal microbiota in children varies seasonally and is driven by two distinct types of air pollutants.\nChildren living in cities are more vulnerable to air pollution because their immune and respiratory systems are still immature. Moreover, urban air often contains high levels of pollutants, which account for increased rates of asthma, pneumonia, poor lung function, allergic disorders, and respiratory infections.\nChanges in the upper respiratory tract microbiota can reduce resistance to pathogens, promoting infection. Air pollution predisposes to such changes.\nEarlier studies used proxy data rather than personal exposure to air pollution or focused on a single pollutant rather than a mixture of pollutants. They ignored seasonal shifts in respiratory microbiota, which may influence how they react to pollution. These shifts are caused by changes in the diet and in circulating viruses.\nLimonene, a citrus-scented VOC from cleaning products, disproportionately impacted nasal microbiota, reducing Neisseriaceae and suppressing entire phyla like Actinobacteriota, suggesting indoor sources play a critical role.\nThe current study addressed these factors together. The data came from the “MAPS MI” projects, which involved both parents and children in monitoring their exposure to air pollution over two seasons.\nThe study took place in Milan, Italy, in the spring and winter of 2018-2019. It captured exposures occurring during the usual routine of the children’s school-going year, including seasonal changes. The average age of the children was 8-9 years. About one in three children had pets, and a similar proportion were exposed to smoking at home.\nThe researchers fitted children with devices measuring equivalent Black Carbon (eBC) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). These represent particulate and gaseous pollutants, respectively. The devices collected data from the end of the school day to the beginning of the next school day. Nasal samples were also taken.\nAll pollutants detected here were 2-3 times more concentrated in winter compared to spring. Of the 169 nasal samples, 95 and 74 were from winter and spring, respectively. Seasonal variation accounted for 3% of the difference in microbiota diversity between samples.\nWinter samples showed an enrichment of Moraxella, while Staphylococcus was more enriched in spring. Moraxella tends to dominate other bacteria, reducing microbial diversity. This agrees with the reduced number of species found in winter.\nThis is perhaps because children spend more time indoors in less ventilated spaces and are not exposed to as many environmental microbes as they are in warmer seasons.\nNasal microbiota changes occurred within hours of peak pollution exposure, hinting at rapid bacterial community shifts that could precede respiratory symptoms.\nWhile Moraxella commonly inhabits children's airways, it can cause disease and worsen the symptoms of chronic disease or respiratory infection.\nPeak eBC exposure reduced microbial diversity both in spring and winter, though the latter was not statistically significant. However, average eBC levels were more important than peak levels in their effects on the abundance of microbial genera. eBC could come from diesel exhaust, for instance, indicating that very short periods of exposure can produce hyper-responsive airways and worsen asthma attacks.\nVOC exposure did not produce such consistent effects.\nCertain species, like Corynebacterium, became less abundant with increasing air pollution. While the direction of this effect was generally consistent across seasons, for some exposures like peak eBC, the impact was more pronounced in spring. Others, like Neisseriaceae, became more abundant with increasing pollution, especially in spring. Species like Alloprevotella and Gemella showed pronounced seasonal shifts in their response to pollution levels; for example, exposure to benzene was associated with a decrease in their abundance in winter but an increase in spring.\nVOCs produced the most obvious effects on the abundance of various genera, in contrast to the subtler effects of eBC. VOCs caused the Veillonella genus to become less abundant. For instance, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) increased Neisseriaceae abundance, while limonene (often found in cleaning products) reduced it. Both benzene (a VOC) and eBC led to an increase in Moraxella abundance.\nPhyla like Actinobacteriota and Fusobacteriota were decreased by limonene exposure.\nThus, air pollution reduces beneficial bacteria like Corynebacterium or increases potentially pathogenic species like Moraxella. Some species show a seasonal shift.\nThis knowledge should stimulate parents to improve indoor air quality. They should avoid indoor smoking, lighting scented candles or indoor fireplaces, and using cleaning products that release VOCs is one step.\nTo reduce peak exposures, children should use less busy routes to school. Policies should focus on creating low-pollution zones in and around schools.\nChildren exposed to secondhand smoke at home showed 15% lower microbial diversity compared to peers in smoke-free households, independent of outdoor pollution levels.\nThe current study is the first to show how gaseous and particulate air pollution alter nasal microbiota in school-age children, and the importance of seasonal variation in its effects. Air pollutant exposure is 2-3 times higher in winter, and Moraxella is a dominant feature of the nasal microbiota, which shows reduced diversity.\nSpring reduced air pollution levels, while the microbiota became more diverse. Staphylococcus became more abundant, this being a marker of other beneficial bacteria in the airway. This might indicate a more balanced composition of bacterial species in spring.\nAir pollution causes inflammation and oxidative stress, which could alter the interactions between respiratory microbiota and the immune system and promote an increase in less abundant species at the expense of more common bacteria.\nThe authors acknowledge certain limitations, such as the relatively small sample size and the study's focus on children in a specific urban environment (Milan, Italy), which may affect the generalizability of the findings to other populations or settings. Reducing air pollution helps keep the respiratory microbiome more diverse, allowing beneficial commensals to dominate and reducing respiratory infection risk.\nWritten by\nDr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001.

    "text": "Sixteen Nobel prize-winning economists issued a letter attacking former President Donald Trump just hours ahead of the first 2024 presidential debate. In the letter, the authors warned that Trump, if re-elected, would destroy the U.S. economy and cause consumers to pay higher prices at the store. The economists claimed that Trump’s economic policies would drive inflation to unprecedented levels with his “fiscally irresponsible budgets.” However, under President Joe Biden’s term, inflation has risen to about 5.6 percent. In comparison, inflation averaged 1.9 percent under the Trump Administration— typically below the Federal Reserve’s two percent target. In 2021, the inflation rate was at 1.4 percent. By June 2022, as Biden settled into his term, the inflation rate spiked to nine percent. The real average weekly earnings rose to 8.2 percent, while it was down 3.9 percent under Biden. In addition, there have been 36 months with year-over-year inflation at or above three percent. On the contrary, with Trump in office, there were zero months. Meanwhile, last year, the average Thanksgiving dinner was 14.7 percent higher than when Trump was in office. In 2021, the holiday meal only cost Americans $53.31. Families shelled out a whopping 25 percent more than the $48.91 they did in 2019. The letter reads: Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty. For a country like the US, which is embedded in deep relationships with other countries, conforming to international norms and having normal and stable relationships with other countries is also an imperative. Donald Trump and the vagaries of his actions and policies threaten this stability and the US’s standing in the world. While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we all agree that Joe Biden’s economic agenda is vastly superior to Donald Trump’s. In his first four years as President, Joe Biden signed into law major investments in the U.S. economy, including in infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, and climate. Together, these investments are likely to increase productivity and economic growth while lowering long-term inflationary pressures and facilitating the clean energy transition. Recommended The letter also touted Biden’s “remarkably strong and equitable” economic recovery since the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump campaign’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back against the letter, praising the former president for building one of the strongest economies in U.S. history. \"The American people don’t need worthless out-of-touch Nobel Prize winners to tell them which president put more money in their pockets... Joe Biden’s out-of-control spending created the worst inflation crisis in generations,” Leavitt said. According to polls, the economy and inflation are the Americans’ top concerns, repeatedly indicating that they trust Trump more with the economy than Biden. A June YouGov for the Economist survey found that 60 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s economic policies, with just 31 percent approving. A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll also found that respondents trust Trump to do a better job on the economy and inflation than the 81-year-old president by a margin of 14 percentage points.",

    "title": "Northern lights forecast tonight. Will aurora borealis be visible in Ohio?",
    "text": "Hide Caption\nWatch: Stunning aurora erupts above observers Beautiful northern lights burst with colors above stargazers in Alaska. So far, 2024 has been an amazing year for astrological phenomena. From the solar eclipse , supermoons , and now a temporary second moon orbiting the Earth, the sky's paintbrush never fails to bring awe to our eyes.\nAnd not to mention the Northern Lights. If you missed the spectacular display in May or the other solar storms over the summer, there might be another chance to witness this magnificent geomagnetic storm tonight into Friday evening.Here's what to know.According to the Space Weather Prediction Center , the northern lights, or aurora borealis, will be visible Thursday night and are expected to peak Friday night. Astrology-loving Ohioans, you might have the chance to get the perfect view of the northern nights.Depending on the conditions, the geomagnetic storm could be visible across Ohio. The highest activity of the northern lights will be tonight between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. and on Friday between sunset and around midnight.\nAurora borealis map tonight Here's a map of the Aurora Borealis forecast created by the Space Weather Prediction Center, showing how far south the aurora might come tonight.\nAccording to the SPWC , part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, minor to strong geomagnetic storms, level G1 out of G3 , are likely tonight and Friday.These storms are caused by coronal mass ejections associated with a recent solar flare from the sun. The storm could cause some power fluctuations, disrupt radio and GPS signals, and push the northern lights to the south.If today's storm hits at G3 strength, it could bring the northern lights back to Ohio.\nIn a story by the Record-Courier , if lower G3 levels in a geomagnetic storm are reached in the late evening or early morning, the aurora may be visible for areas in Ohio down to the Ohio River. If levels stay at G1, the storm might be visible only to those up north into Michigan.\nBy comparison, the May 10 geomagnetic storm that made the aurora visible across Ohio was rated a G5, the most extreme, and brought the northern lights across the U.S.During times of high geomagnetic activity, which pushes the northern lights further south, the aurora will be visible directly overhead in the northern United States, according to the SWPC's viewing tips .For the best viewing, the center recommends that it be very dark. Get away from city lights and avoid trying to see them on the night of a full moon. The best time to view the aurora is within an hour or two of midnight, or 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.Auroras are ribbons of light weaving across Earth's northern or southern polar regions, according to NASA . Magnetic storms that have been triggered by solar activity, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, cause them. The solar wind carries energetic charged particles from these events away from the sun.\nAccording to Space.com , these energized particles hit the atmosphere at 45 million mph and are redirected to the poles by the earth's magnetic field , creating the light show.\nAccording to NOAA , during major geomagnetic storms, the auroras expand away from the poles and can be seen over some parts of the United States .NASA describes coronal mass ejections as \"huge bubbles of coronal plasma threaded by intense magnetic field lines that are ejected from the sun over the course of several hours.\"The Akron Beacon Journal reports that the space agency says they often look like \"huge, twisted rope\" and can occur with solar flares, or explosions on the sun's surface.\nNOAA offers an aurora dashboard\nIf you're curious about the latest forecast for the aurora, the NOAA has a tool for that. The Aurora Dashboard offers a visual, animated prediction of where the aurora might be seen in the next few minutes as well as the following day.",

    "title": "Javi López (PSC): “Junts ha llegado a un acuerdo con el PSOE, pero si quiere un gobierno con PP y Vox tendrá que explicárselo a los catalanes”",
    "text": "Noticias relacionadas Junts recula sobre la marcha de Puigdemont si no es investido 'president' Javi López es el candidato del PSC a las elecciones europeas del próximo domingo. Unos comicios que, para la ciudadanía, se perciben lejanos pero que también son muy relevantes para el día a día. No solo servirán para decidir el rumbo de políticas trascendentales para los Estados miembros de la Unión Europea, sino también para medir los apoyos de los partidos tras las elecciones autonómicas del 12 de mayo .\nSe perciben como una segunda vuelta . Eso explica que las formaciones no se hayan atrevido a mostrar sus cartas y hayan optado por posponer las negociaciones de la investidura del próximo president de la Generalitat. Aunque no cabe duda de que la campaña ha tenido su miga con cuestiones como la Ley de Amnistía aprobada en el Congreso de los Diputados o el guiño del líder del PP Alberto Núñez Feijóo a los de Carles Puigdemont para llevar a cabo una moción de censura contra Pedro Sánchez.\nEl candidato del PSC a las elecciones europeas Javi López Òscar Gil Barcelona\nSobre esto último, López se ha mostrado convencido de que, a los populares, les viene bien la amnistía otorgada a Junts porque abre la puerta a normalizar sus relaciones. En una entrevista con Crónica Global, recuerda que Génova ya tuvo conversaciones con los neoconvergentes el pasado verano: \"El problema para el PP no era pactar con Junts, sino que no podía meter en la misma ecuación a Junts y a Vox\", espeta.\nEstas elecciones europeas han ido precedidas por unas catalanas que han sido trascendentales. ¿Ha tenido la sensación de que han quedado opacadas algunas cuestiones de ámbito europeo que son importantes? Tengo la percepción de que hay un cierto cansancio electoral, especialmente en Cataluña, porque hemos tenido tres contiendas muy seguidas. El último mes el PSC ha hecho un enorme esfuerzo por explicar todo lo que está en juego este domingo para Europa. Por primera vez existe el riesgo de una entrada con mucha fuerza de una extrema derecha a la que el PPE le abra la puerta. Tenemos que reforzar el proyecto europeo si queremos adaptarnos a un mundo en profundo cambio. Este riesgo de la extrema derecha lo impediría y, probablemente, nos empujaría a la irrelevancia internacional. ¿Qué se ha hecho mal para que la extrema derecha irrumpa con tanta fuerza? La extrema derecha espera sacar un total de un 16-18% en el voto europeo, con muchas opciones de ganar en Holanda, Austria, Francia o Italia. Esa es la realidad. Se nutre de la desigualdad y de aquellos que se sienten apartados por los beneficios de la globalización. Ante esto, la extrema derecha levanta la mano y dice si queréis poner un freno de mano a todos estos cambios tan acelerados, votadme . El problema es que ese freno de mano no existe . Nosotros intentamos decir que la extrema derecha habla de problemas reales con recetas falsas que dividen a nuestras sociedades y levantan bajas pasiones y odio en muchas ocasiones. La socialdemocracia y los socialistas europeos esperamos obtener en España uno de los mejores resultados de toda Europa. Precisamente por el cansancio electoral que antes comentaba, se espera que haya una participación baja el próximo domingo. ¿Qué le dice a la ciudadanía para que vaya a votar? Les decimos varias cosas. Primero, que estas son diferentes a todas las elecciones europeas pasadas. El equilibrio de fuerzas en Bruselas puede cambiar por primera vez en 70 años la integración y está en riesgo el modelo de bienestar y de libertades que hemos construido en Europa. En segundo lugar, necesitamos consolidar los cambios positivos que hemos tenido en Europa. Una Europa que ayudó durante la pandemia en la vacunación, con los fondos de recuperación, que protegió el mercado laboral europeo y español con los ERTE, que ha puesto en marcha el Pacto Verde Europeo . Estos beneficios, pasar de la política de recortes y austeridad a la política de inversión, están en juego este domingo. Y en tercer lugar, necesitamos reforzar el proyecto europeo para adaptar a Europa, que es el 6% de la población mundial, a una dinámica económica y política de altísima competencia internacional. Uno de los temas que se han colado en la campaña de las europeas es la ley de amnistía. Con esta medida de gracia, ¿se da por acabado el procés? Lo que ha dado por acabado el procés y ha abierto una nueva etapa política en Cataluña son las elecciones del 12 de mayo y el resultado. Un resultado que además se ha leído con mucha atención y seguido con mucha atención desde fuera. Un resultado que da dos grandes noticias. La primera, una victoria muy clara e histórica, en votos y escaños, del PSC y de Salvador Illa . La segunda, se pierde por primera vez la mayoría independentista en el Parlament en la democracia reciente. La nueva etapa política tiene que pasar por el liderazgo de Illa al frente de la Generalitat. Ha contribuido la estrategia de diálogo, distensión y convivencia del gobierno de Pedro Sánchez , que incluía medidas de gracia como los indultos o la ley de amnistía. ¿Cómo se ve la amnistía en Europa? Las amnistías no son ajenas al ordenamiento jurídico europeo. De hecho, existen explícitamente en constituciones como la portuguesa o la italiana. En el caso de Alemania hemos tenido una cincuentena de leyes de amnistía, que son mecanismos extraordinarios para hechos extraordinarios como los que vivimos aquí, muy graves, de 2017 . Así que no es ajeno a nuestro contexto y a nuestros estándares europeos. Desde fuera, que siempre se ven las cosas con más distancia y no con tanta pasión, se ve que el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez ha sido valiente y con mucho coraje para afrontar lo que era la crisis institucional más grande que había vivido la democracia española, que vivimos durante los gobiernos del Partido Popular en el 2017 y que la ha resuelto. ¿Ve a Carles Puigdemont volviendo con esta ley de amnistía en el corto plazo para una nueva investidura? Lo desconozco. Es una decisión que tiene que tomar él. Los partidos independentistas y el PP le han criticado al Gobierno que no esté publicada en el BOE. Lo achacan a la campaña de las europeas… Es un procedimiento ordinario en toda esta cuestión. Es una ley más que se publicará en el BOE, una ley que tiene la legitimidad como cualquier otra aprobada. En los últimos días hemos visto un nuevo guiño de Alberto Núñez Feijóo a Junts . El líder del PP ha hablado de una moción de censura contra Sánchez. ¿Les ve pactando? Provoca mucha extrañeza que el señor Feijóo, después de pasarse meses manifestando contra la amnistía, abra la puerta a hacer una moción de censura. También sabemos que esas conversaciones existieron durante el verano, después de las elecciones generales. El problema para el PP no era pactar con Junts, sino que no podía meter en la misma ecuación a Junts y a Vox. Aunque sea su argumento principal frente al gobierno, no tenía ningún problema en llegar a ese tipo de acuerdos. A diferencia de nosotros, cualquier conversación que hemos tenido ha sido muy pública y muy transparente. Lo que no sabemos es lo que hablaron y lo que hablan hoy el señor Feijóo con Junts. Otro de los acuerdos del PSOE alcanzados con el independentismo es la oficialidad del catalán en la Unión Europea . ¿Es este otro reto para la próxima legislatura? Hay un acuerdo político y un compromiso en el que va a apoyar la oficialidad de las lenguas oficiales. No solo del catalán, también del euskera y el gallego. Una lengua que tiene también un reconocimiento constitucional. Y apoyar su uso en el Parlamento Europeo requiere de unanimidad. Se ha llevado la cuestión en diferentes ocasiones al Consejo de Asuntos Generales de la Unión Europea y, al mismo tiempo, el uso del catalán en el Parlamento Europeo requiere de una mayoría en la mesa del Parlamento. Los socialistas estamos comprometidos con esto. La diversidad lingüística es una fortaleza de Europa. Refuerza también la proyección de la riqueza de la diversidad de España en la Unión Europea y en Bruselas. Creemos en el reconocimiento de nuestra diversidad interna y, al mismo tiempo, creemos que, para la Unión Europea y para las instituciones europeas, una medida de este tipo acerca a millones de parlantes de estas lenguas las instituciones europeas. Volviendo a Cataluña, ¿el PSC descarta del todo una abstención para que Puigdemont sea presidente?\nAbsolutamente. ¿Aunque eso implique que Junts siga amenazando con tumbar la legislatura en Madrid? Junts ha llegado a un acuerdo político con el PSOE, que tiene que ver con la investidura y el apoyo al gobierno de España. Si quiere hacer un gobierno con Vox y el PP, tendrá que explicarle a los catalanes y a las españolas para hacer qué y por qué. ¿Sería un fracaso que Cataluña vuelva a elecciones en otoño? Absolutamente. Llevamos diez años de parálisis y bloqueo en la política catalana. Yo creo que existe una voluntad de los catalanes de volver a tener una gestión eficaz de nuestro autogobierno, centrada en la educación, la sanidad, la sequía , la energía, nuestra industria. No podemos permitirnos seis meses más de parálisis. ¿Cuáles son las dos o tres principales prioridades o propuestas en esta nueva legislatura europea?\nNosotros reclamamos más Europa, reforzar el proyecto europeo, consolidar el cambio en la política económica. Apostar por una agenda verde, con dimensión social, una transición justa que se apoya a los consumidores, en los trabajadores y en la industria en este cambio masivo que vamos a liderar. Queremos una Europa que garantice nuestro modelo social basado en servicios públicos de calidad, en trabajos de calidad. Y que haga frente, en la protección de nuestro modelo social, a uno de los grandes retos, que es el acceso a la vivienda. Esperamos que se puedan realizar desde este mandato. Hace unos días el gobierno reconoció el Estado palestino. ¿Están satisfechos? ¿Es suficiente?\nNo es suficiente en tanto en cuanto al drama humanitario. Las muertes de civiles y las operaciones militares continúan en la franja de Gaza. Hay 35.000 muertos en la franja. Tenemos además la Corte Internacional de Justicia, que ha dictado medidas que son vinculantes para el derecho internacional público y que hoy no se están cumpliendo por parte de Israel. Hay que recordar que ha sido un reconocimiento coordinado con Noruega e Irlanda y, ahora, se ha sumado a Eslovenia. Y estos cuatro países envían el mensaje de que la única salida para Oriente Medio, para Israel y Palestina, son dos Estados que convivan con paz y seguridad . Y empujar en esta dirección. La respuesta a ello ha sido la fotografía de Netanyahu con el señor Abascal, al que deja literalmente fuera de juego a Feijóo.",
