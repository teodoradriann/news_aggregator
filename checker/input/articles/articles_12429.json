    "text": "It's no surprise that NFL WAGs often juggle family life, career, and supporting their husbands. But for Kelly Stafford, wife of LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the mental toll of balancing it all was real when she took her sick daughters to the Rams' wild-card game against the Minnesota Vikings. Kelly explained how she was overcome with guilt for taking her sick children to the game, and how Matthew helped her move forward.Guilty of Battling Family ResponsibilitiesDuring a recent episode of The Morning After podcast, Kelly shared the emotional struggles she faced leading up to the trip. With her daughters feeling under the weather, she wrestled with the guilt of whether it was right to be on a flight and at the game.There was a huge guilt factor,\\\" Kelly said, reflecting on the flight. \\\"I was thinking, 'Should we even be on this plane right now with everyone surrounding us and all the players preparing for the game?' But Matthew said, 'Get your ass on that plane. We all need to be together'\\\" Her husband's reassuring words lifted her spirits, reminding her that sometimes family needs to stick together, no matter the circumstances.https://youtu.be/W3eT7gaTWnU?si=GYEg1vs9FLda1L86The Support of Matthew StaffordIt was Matthew’s mental support that helped Kelly feel confident in her decision to attend the game. Despite her doubts, Matthew’s insistence on their unity helped push past her guilt.Kelly recalled, \\\"That was such an incredible thing for me to hear because there was a little bit of like, ‘Should I just stay back with my children?’ Matthew was like, ’No, we will do whatever it takes. We are all getting on this plane. We are going to be together right now.\\\" The fact that Matt had been steady, as they all were going to get through this together.Acknowledging The LA HeroesAs for Kelly, she had sleep disorders because of the fires; however, what triggered her is when she got concerned about whether the fires are coming closer or the city she resides in, as it created fear in her that kept her from sleeping well, adding up her stress level.Her emotional messages about the LA firefighters and their sacrifices remind us to recognize the unsung heroes working behind the scenes.\\\"I just pray for the safety of these individuals and for God to come in the hearts of their families and protect them. We don't thank our First Responders enough ever. You know it always takes something like this for everyone to go to the firehouses and to thank them but really we should be doing that all the time.\\\"Kelly Stafford's journey through guilt, family struggles, and supporting her husband while battling personal demons shows the strength in her. She was able to push through because of Matthew and the importance of family, even when the obstacles were too overwhelming.Also read - Trolling Hits Hard for NFL WAGs, and Girlfriend of Braxton Berrios Alix Earle Is No Exception—Here’s How It Affected Her and How She Developed Thick Skin Amid Online Criticism",

    "text": "Removing bacteria and grime from a toilet seat is a rather simple task, but it can be surprisingly destructive when the wrong cleaning product is used. This is especially true for plastic toilet seats that are often less durable than other materials. Soft Scrub is among the cleaning products you should avoid using on plastic toilet seats. The abrasive calcium carbonate included in the formula may scratch this material, leaving you with an unsightly toilet seat that would need to be repaired.\nAdvertisement Although the calcium carbonate pieces in Soft Scrub make the perfect exfoliator for scrubbing dirt and grime away from surfaces that are a bit more scratch-resistant, you should be cautious about using the product on a plastic toilet seat. Some customers have even shared first-hand experience of the damage caused by this product. It is best to save your Soft Scrub for surfaces that can handle its scrubbing power and turn to more gentle products, which is one of many tips on how to clean your toilet .\nSoft Scrub can scratch plastic toilet seats @anxietyscrubs I sprayed my toilet brush with Clorox bleach spray last night and let it dry cause that’s what I see all y’all doing and I woke up to the brush being orange 😭😭😭 why does this happen to me 💀 #cleantok #moptok #ReTokforNature #cleaningmotivation #laundrytok #amazonfinds #targetfinds #mustbuy #cleaningtips #cleaninghacks #squeakyclean #cleanwithme #transformation #asmrsounds\n♬ Hold Me Closer - Elton John & Britney Spears\nIf you have been tempted to try any plastic toilet seat cleaning hacks that involve the use of Soft Scrub, the TikTok posted by user @anxietyscrubs might just convince you that this is not the wisest decision. As you can see in the video above, the content creator explained that the product scratched a plastic toilet seat in a previous apartment. Additionally, @anxietyscrubs warned against using steel wool pads on this surface. With this in mind, you may also want to avoid cleaning plastic toilet seats with harsh scrubbing brushes, scouring pads, or any other tools or solutions that are super abrasive.\nAdvertisement It is important to note that the Soft Scrub website confirms the product can be used in a toilet bowl, but does not state that it can be safely used on a plastic toilet seat. This may explain why @anxietyscrubs accidentally damaged the surface with this product. While using Soft Scrub on a plastic toilet seat is a risk, there's no problem using it inside your toilet bowl. The cleaning solution can clean more durable surfaces without causing scratches thanks to the low hardness rating of calcium carbonate. This scrubbing ingredient is rated at level 3 on the Moh's Hardness Scale.\nHow to clean a plastic toilet seat safely\nEggeeggjiew/Getty Images\nThere is no special toilet cleaning trick you need to rely on to remove grime from a plastic toilet seat. The process is super simple. To clean this surface, start out by applying a mild, non-abrasive cleaning solution or a neutral soap all over. You can make the soap easier to apply by pouring it into a spray bottle and thinning it out with water. Spray the entire seat with the solution. Next, use a gentle cleaning cloth, paper towel, or sponge to wipe the cleaning solution away. It should have loosened up any grime to make it easier to remove. You may need to repeat this process to tackle particularly stubborn stains. Feel free to let the cleaning solution sit for a few minutes to allow it to really penetrate any grime that refuses to budge.\nAdvertisement You can use this same cleaning solution to tackle your toilet's hinges and lid. Simply spray it onto these surfaces and wipe it away with a cloth or sponge. Do not forget that you can go in with Soft Scrub or your favorite toilet bowl cleaning solution when tackling your toilet bowl if needed. This may help you remove built up grime easier than a simple soap and water solution.",

    "text": "What type of passenger are you on a long flight? Are you the type who falls asleep as soon as the plane takes off, only waking up when the meal is being served and when the plane lands? Or are you the type that never falls asleep, so you binge-watch an entire TV show while snacking on the complimentary snacks and drinks, and maybe chat a bit with your neighboring passenger? I think it's great that every person can find what to do on a flight in order to relax and enjoy the experience, but the experience for doctors on flights can become something entirely different. It is no secret that doctors have a greater responsibility than most of the other professions, but you would think that on their time off, they would be able to relax and let loose a bit. Apparently not, as in this Reddit story, a doctor shares that while on a flight, he decided to give himself a break and enjoy a few drinks. He chatted for a while with the woman sitting next to him, telling her he was a doctor, when an announcement was made asking for a doctor to assist a passenger on the plane. Since he already had several drinks he wasn't feeling up to the task, but the passenger next to him was extremely mad about his decision to sit this one out. Scroll down for the full tale, and for the surprising comments who were not all in favor of the doctor.

    "text": "El [Real Madrid](https://okdiario.com/diariomadridista/baloncesto/) ha cerrado una primera vuelta de la [Euroliga](https://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague/) casi inmaculada con su trabajada victoria de este jueves en cancha del Asvel francés (76-77). Lastrado por las ausencias, el equipo blanco fue a remolque durante casi todo el encuentro, pero sacó a relucir su superioridad en el último cuarto para llevarse un nuevo triunfo, el decimosexto en 17 jornadas de esta fase regular. Los pívots [Walter Tavares](https://okdiario.com/diariomadridista/real-madrid/tavares-teme-esta-pareja-centrales-real-madrid-redes-enloquecen-nombre-386009) (16 puntos y 12 rebotes) y Poirier (17) fueron los mejores en Lyon. Desde el inicio ya se barruntó que al Madrid le esperaba una noche pestosa en Francia. Llegaba el último duelo europeo del año con cuatro bajas importantes -Gabriel Deck, Rudy Fernandez, Mario Hezonja y Guerschon Yabusele- y se medía a un rival hipermotivado, consciente de que batir al líder era una de las pocas formas de echarse una alegría a la boca en una temporada plagada de penurias. Facundo Campazzo no lograba gobernar el partido como acostumbra frente a Paris Lee, uno de los pocos bases que juega a su misma altura. No es casualidad que el estadounidense sea el jugador que más balones roba en la máxima competición europea. De su mano el Asvel se apuntaba un certero parcial de 13-4 al inicio y cerraba el primer cuarto con ventaja en el marcador. Si le dejas la puerta abierta… ¡ [@23Llull]entra hasta dentrooo! 😎 [#Eurofighters] [pic.twitter.com/0cmnA0z9Ju] — Basket en Movistar Plus+ (@MovistarBasket) [December 28, 2023] La inercia se mantuvo en el segundo parcial bajo la atenta mirada de Tony Parker, mito del baloncesto francés que ahora trabaja en los despachos como presidente del Asvel. El equipo galo hacía soñar a su afición con otro buen parcial que le permitía alcanzar el descanso con una ventaja inesperada antes del encuentro (39-33). Su buen desempeño también se prolongó durante el tercer cuarto ante un rival que esperaba paciente el momento de sacar el hacha. 𝑬́𝒓𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒖𝒏𝒂 𝒗𝒆𝒛 𝒖𝒏 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒐 𝒚 𝒖𝒏 𝑯𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒄𝒐́𝒑𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒐. [@SergioRodriguez]🤝 [@viinze_17P] [#Eurofighters] [pic.twitter.com/CdoX4Bevhm] — Basket en Movistar Plus+ (@MovistarBasket) [December 28, 2023] A falta de 7:30 para el final, el Madrid por fin logró ponerse por delante en el marcador. Un ‘alley-oop’ entre esa sociedad limitada formada por el Chacho y Poirier entregaba un pequeño premio al equipo después de mucho tiempo remando entre la espesura. La jugada de la noche se producía en medio de un parcial de 0-16 para los visitantes que imponía a plomo la lógica de la clasificación (57-67). Como siempre, Tavares Seis minutos se pasó el colista sin anotar, presa del arreón del líder en ambos lados de la cancha. Parecía que todo el pescado estaba vendido, pero el Asvel regaló a su hinchada un arranque de orgullo y un parcial de 8-0 que le permitió soñar con su primera victoria en casa de la temporada. Una canasta de Lee empataba el marcador a falta de 48 segundos para la conclusión (74-74). Cuando más quemaba la pelota, el Madrid la puso en las manos de sus jugadores más determinantes. Tavares anotó un ganchito, el Asvel falló en su siguiente jugada y Campazzo fue a la línea del tiro libre, pero solo anotó uno. Los franceses perdían por tres y tenían cinco segundos de posesión (74-77), pero incomprensiblemente anotaron de dos en vez de buscar un triple. Ni siquiera le hizo falta anotar a Llull desde el tiro libre. La victoria era blanca una noche más. 𝑵𝒐 𝒉𝒂𝒚 𝒈𝒍𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏 𝒔𝒖𝒇𝒓𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐… El Real Madrid cierra la mejor primera vuelta de la historia de Euroleague con un ajustado triunfo ante el ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne.
