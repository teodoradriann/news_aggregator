The same choices offered up in 2020.\nAnd now- just like I said they would- Democrats have switched up their candidate so late in the game they are riding on a honeymoon high that may last till the Fall.\nIt is no time for conservatives to be cocky.\nI’m Tomi Lahren and you watch my show “Tomi Lahren is Fearless” at\nOutkick.com",

    "text": "Revolutionizing Lunar Exploration: NASA’s Pioneering Robotic Mission\nSummary: NASA is charting new territory with its first-ever commercial robotic lunar landing, which is set to launch at the beginning of 2023. This mission is a critical component of NASA’s Artemis program and its CLPS initiative, aiming to lay the foundation for future human exploration of the Moon. The mission’s live broadcast promises to engage the public in this historic space venture.\nIn the early hours of a January morning, an unparalleled chapter in space exploration will unfold as NASA spearheads a trailblazing commercial robotic lunar mission. The debut of the Vulcan rocket will see it embark on a pivotal journey to the Moon from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, carrying the innovative Peregrine lander designed by Astrobotic.\nEmbarking on a Lunar Odyssey: NASA’s Robotic Leap Forward\nNASA’s lunar exploration is set to enter an exciting phase with the latest mission — a hallmark of commercial and governmental collaboration aimed at the Moon’s conquest. Scheduled for a night launch, which provides optimal conditions for travel to Earth’s closest celestial neighbor, the Vulcan rocket will unleash the full potential of collaboration between NASA, ULA, and Astrobotic.\nThe Peregrine lander is central to this lunar mission. Once it descends onto the dusty lunar surface, instruments will be deployed to study the Moon’s environment and test new technologies essential for future human ventures. This mission will lay the groundwork prior to sending astronauts to explore the Moon’s uncharted South Pole.\nInformative communication will be a central part of this mission’s journey. From the commencement of launch coverage days in advance, to interactive outreach initiatives such as virtual attendance and social media engagement, NASA is ensuring the world can witness this monumental event.\nNASA’s vision extends beyond this single mission, planning more deliveries to the Moon’s surface to expand human knowledge and capabilities in space. This launch is a hopeful declaration of our commitment to exploration, a signpost in our quest to uncover the mysteries of the cosmos and learn from our celestial neighbor.\nWhat is the significance of NASA’s upcoming lunar mission?\nThe upcoming mission marks NASA’s first commercial robotic lunar landing, a critical part of NASA’s Artemis program and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative. It aims to lay the groundwork for future human exploration of the Moon.\nWhen is the mission scheduled to launch, and what makes the launch special?\nThe mission is set to launch at the beginning of 2023 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This launch signifies an unparalleled chapter in space exploration as it is the debut of the Vulcan rocket and represents a significant commercial and governmental collaboration in lunar exploration.\nWhat is the Vulcan rocket, and what will it carry?\nThe Vulcan rocket is a new launch vehicle that will carry the innovative Peregrine lander designed by Astrobotic.\nWhat is the Peregrine lander’s purpose?\nThe Peregrine lander will descend onto the lunar surface to deploy instruments to study the Moon’s environment and test new technologies that are vital for future human exploration, particularly planning to send astronauts to explore the Moon’s uncharted South Pole.\nHow will the public be able to engage with this mission?\nNASA will provide extensive communications about this mission, including a live broadcast of the mission launch and interactive outreach initiatives such as virtual attendance and social media engagement, allowing the public to follow and participate in this historic event.\nWhat are NASA’s future plans for lunar exploration?\nNASA plans to continue sending more deliveries to the Moon’s surface through additional missions, aiming to expand human knowledge and capabilities in space exploration.\nDefinitions:\n– NASA: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. government agency responsible for the nation’s civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.\n– Artemis program: NASA’s ongoing program to return humans to the Moon and establish sustainable lunar exploration by the end of the decade.\n– CLPS initiative: Commercial Lunar Payload Services, a NASA program to contract with private companies for small robotic lunar landers.\n– ULA: United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Space and Boeing Defense, Space & Security that provides launch services to spacecraft.\nRelated Links:\nNASA\nUnited Launch Alliance\nAstrobotic\nNatalia Toczkowska is a notable figure in digital health technology, recognized for her contributions in advancing telemedicine and healthcare apps.

The Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) is launching a new program it says will bring care closer to families, and tackle long wait lists. The Kids Come First team will bring its services to Brockville General Hospital and Carleton Place & District Memorial Hospital to complete day surgeries like appendectomies, tonsillectomies, hernia removals and orthopedic surgeries. “Delayed surgeries can harm the development of local children and youth. This collaboration gives them access to the day surgery they need without further delay and closer to home,” Mary Wilson Trider, CEO of the Mississippi River Health Alliance at Carleton Place Hospital, said in a statement. Surgeries at the hospitals have already begun. Officials say the goal is to complete 300 procedures by 2025, and expand to even more hospitals in eastern Ontario. The program comes after the Ford government announced an additional $330-million in annual funding in pediatric healthcare last year.",

    "text": "A buyer has paid €1.932 millon (around £1.69m) for one of Napoleon’s trademark bicorne hats. The sale, in Paris on Sunday, makes the headgear, with its distinctive cockade of ribbons, the most valuable Napoleon hat ever sold. The two-pointed hats worn by France’s first Emperor were a well-known visual marker even during his life. Napoleon wore the hats sideways, against the prevailing fashion. He is believed to have owned 120 of them during his life. The most valuable hat before this week’s sale was sold in 2014 for nearly €1.9 m. That hat had been worn at the the Battle of Marengo in 1800. That was one of Napoleon’s most famous military triumphs. This hat has a less glorious history, and was worn by Napoleon as he returned from exile in Elba, on his way to his final defeat at Waterloo. The hat was the star item in the sale of the collection of French tycoon Col Pierre Baillon who died in 2022. It had been in the family of Napoleon’s quarter master Jean-Louis Noisiez for much of its history. The distinctive tricolore ribbons also tied it to the emperor. Just 20 of Napoleon’s hats are believed to survive, only 5 of them in private hands. Sales are rare. The auction was a rich hunting ground for Napoleon enthusiasts. It also included a nightshirt, a vanity case, and a plate nabbed from his carriage after Waterloo. The release of a new Napoleon biopic means interest in the Corsican-born leader is especially high. Napoleon rose from relatively humble origins in a newly conquered French province to head an Empire that controlled much of Western Europe. His skills as a military tactician are universally acknowledged. His political legacy is still disputed. The emperor’s sword sold for £3 million in 2007. The engagement ring he gave to Josephine (his wife, who plays an enormous role in his legend) sold for nearly $1 million in 2013. Both would undoubtedly make much more if sold today.
