    "text": "PORTLAND (WGME) -- Authorities say they seized a significant amount of drugs and arrested a Maine man for trafficking fentanyl and cocaine in Portland. For the past three months, the MDEA says agents and Portland police officers have been investigating 27-year-old Charles Aboda of Portland for drug trafficking in the city. The MDEA say Aboda was selling large quantities of drugs as well as making street level sales to local drug users. During the investigation, the MDEA says undercover agents bought drugs from Aboda. Agents arrested Aboda on Tuesday and charged him with unlawful aggravated trafficking in schedule drugs (fentanyl) and unlawful trafficking in schedule drugs (cocaine). At the time of his arrest, the MDEA says agents seized approximately 3 ounces of fentanyl and cocaine as well as $1,000 in suspected drug proceeds. The MDEA says agents also searched a home in the West End area of Portland in connection with the drug trafficking investigation and found approximately 2 ounces of fentanyl, cocaine, crack cocaine, and methamphetamine as well as a loaded handgun and approximately $10,000 in suspected drug proceeds. Aboda was taken to the Cumberland County Jail. His bail has been set at $15,000 cash.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES -- In the wake of Michigan's [sign-stealing scandal](/college-football/story?_slug_=michigan-sign-stealing-jim-harbaugh-suspension-line&id=38844871), [Alabama](/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide) has taken extra precautions to avoid any potential intrusions by changing the way its players watch practice film in advance of the [College Football Playoff](/college-football/playoff/) semifinal at the [Rose Bowl](/college-football/game?gameId=401551786). \"We're just trying to secure our stuff,\" Alabama running back [Jase McClellan](http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4429001/jase-mcclellan) said. \"[The coaches] didn't do much explaining. They just did it, told us and we adjusted to it.\" According to several players who spoke Thursday, while they typically had been able to have film on their iPads and take it home to watch it on their own time, players have no longer been able to do that as they prepare for the playoff game. \"I think they said [Michigan](/college-football/team/_/id/130/michigan-wolverines) was stealing signs the first eight weeks or something like that,\" wide receiver [Isaiah Bond](http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4808839/isaiah-bond) said of the allegations. \"So we're just watching film with the team, because we're not allowed to watch film on our own; we don't want any stuff like that happening again.\" As Michigan has been accused of stealing opponents' signals this season, opponents have changed their in-game signs and the way they communicate them as well. Not only does Alabama appear to have instructed its players to avoid using their iPads for film study but, as McClellan explained, the team isn't uploading practice film to players' devices anymore, instead keeping it in the main computer system for players to watch with their position groups while at the practice facility. \"We just have to go to a different location to watch film, but we're all watching the film as we normally would for a normal game,\" offensive lineman [Tyler Booker](http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685263/tyler-booker) said. \"It could be a connection because the way the film is set up with the server. All that we know is that we have to go out and treat the preparation like any other game.\" \"We get used to it; we watch film on a daily basis, but on our own time we don't get to watch it on our own now,\" McClellan said. \"We just come all together to watch it. I don't see it as a disadvantage; we have had a couple of weeks to watch film.\" Although several Alabama players acknowledged the technical changes in film consumption, offensive coordinator Tommy Rees refused to answer any questions regarding the subject. \"I'm not going to get into the whole film thing like that,\" Rees said. \"I'm not talking about it. Like I said, our job is to give our players the best chance to have success on the field. We're focused on what we're trying to do, and that's really it.\" Alabama quarterback [Jalen Milroe](http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4432734/jalen-milroe) also brushed aside the notion of not being able to watch film individually and whether that's affecting the team's preparation. \"Well, I watch film all day,\" Milroe said. \"That's something that I've done because the biggest thing was try to be most prepared for all situations in the game. And so I'm watching the film as much as possible and I can't really speak on that, but for me, I'm preparing as much as possible.\" Offensive tackle [JC Latham](http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431437/jc-latham) said that on any given week he would use any free time during recovery or eating at home to watch film, but given the changes, it has altered the way he has had to consume tape. \"I definitely watch it more in-depth now because I can't do it at home,\" Latham said. As for whether the extra care will factor in when an undefeated Michigan team faces the Tide, Bond said he believes the difference is negligible, especially once the game begins. \"It honestly doesn't even matter to me because at end of the day they still got to go on the field to play us,\" Bond said. \"You can know my route, but they still got to guard me at the end of the day.\"",

    "title": "Qantas hack leaks data of 5.7 mn flyers; among information stolen, 1 mn phone numbers & 10,000 meal preferences - The Economic Times",
    "text": "In one of Australia’s biggest cyber breaches in recent years, Qantas Airways has confirmed that personal data belonging to 5.7 million customers was accessed by hackers. The airline said on Wednesday that the compromised information includes names, email addresses, home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and in some cases, meal preferences. The disclosure follows Qantas’ announcement last week of a cyberattack. After reviewing and removing duplicate entries, the airline now says 5.7 million unique customer records were affected, down from an initial estimate of six million. The company has clarified that no financial data or credit card information was accessed, and the breach does not allow direct access to frequent flyer accounts. “There is no evidence that any personal data of the customers has been released and the company is actively monitoring the situation,” Qantas said in a statement. Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said, “Since the incident, we have put in place a number of additional cyber security measures to further protect our customers’ data, and are continuing to review what happened.” The stolen data was broken down as follows: 2.8 million customers had their name, email, and frequent flyer number accessed 1.2 million had their name and email taken 1.3 million had their home address exposed 1.1 million had their birth date accessed 900,000 had their phone numbers taken 400,000 had gender data accessed 10,000 had meal preferences compromised Qantas has started contacting affected individuals to inform them about what data was involved and how they can access support services. The airline is working with cybersecurity specialists and continues to investigate the incident. While the attack did not affect financial systems, it poses a serious test for CEO Vanessa Hudson, who has been working to restore the airline’s public image since taking charge nearly two years ago. The Qantas breach comes amid a rising wave of cyberattacks targeting airlines. In recent weeks, Alaska Air Group Inc.’s Hawaiian Airlines and Canada’s WestJet Airlines Ltd. have also reported breaches. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has attributed several of these incidents to the hacking group Scattered Spider, known for using employee impersonation tactics to gain system access.",

Sus palabras se producen después de que Biden afirmara en una orden ejecutiva que los niveles de violencia de los colonos, sumados al desplazamiento forzado de personas y la destrucción de propiedades, representan “una grave amenaza a la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad de Cisjordania y Gaza, Israel y la región de Oriente Próximo”. Los sancionados son David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil, Shalom Zicherman y Yinon Levi. A los sancionados se les bloquearán todos los activos que puedan tener en Estados Unidos y se les impide recibir transacciones de estadounidenses. En resumen, se les priva el acceso al sistema financiero estadounidense. Además, también se les prohíbe la entrada a Estados Unidos. Estas sanciones están amparadas por una nueva orden ejecutiva que Biden promovió este mismo jueves y que tiene como objetivo castigar a personas “que han perpetrado violencia” y a aquellas “que han participado en repetidos actos de intimidación y destrucción de propiedad, lo que ha llevado al desplazamiento forzado de comunidades palestinas”. Chasdai, por ejemplo, lideró unos disturbios en Huwara con quema de vehículos y de edificios y ataques a civiles palestinos que derivaron en la muerte de un cisjordano; mientras que Tanjil estuvo implicado en ataques a granjeros palestinos. Levi lideró a un grupo de colonos que “crearon una atmósfera de miedo en Cisjordania” con ataques a múltiples comunidades. El sancionado atacó de forma “frecuente” a civiles palestinos y beduinos, amenazándoles para que abandonasen sus viviendas, quemando sus tierras y destruyendo sus propiedades. Zicherman, por su parte, atacó e hirió a activistas israelíes en Cisjordania. En diciembre, Washington ya anunció la prohibición de la entrada al país a los colonos israelíes “radicales”, considerados como responsables de los ataques violentos contra la población palestina en la Cisjordania ocupada.

O Exército israelita indicou que poderão ser membros do movimento islamita palestiniano Hamas mortos nos ataques israelitas.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nO Fórum das Famílias dos Reféns, o principal grupo em se organizaram os familiares das pessoas sequestradas pelo Hamas, apontou este relatório preliminar forense como “mais uma prova da crueldade dos terroristas que mantêm em cativeiro 109 reféns há 321 dias”.\nA organização apelou ao governo liderado por Benjamin Netanyahu para concentrar os seus esforços na obtenção de um acordo que permita a libertação e o regresso a casa dos mais de 100 reféns ainda detidos pelo Hamas na Faixa de Gaza.\n“A cada minuto que passa sem se concluir o acordo, outro refém poderá morrer, e ao fim de dez meses e meio de guerra, durante os quais os reféns têm estado a sofrer e a morrer, todos sabemos que o regresso de todos os reféns só será possível através de um acordo”, sustentaram num comunicado.\nIsrael declarou a 7 de outubro do ano passado uma guerra na Faixa de Gaza para “erradicar” o Hamas, horas depois de este ter realizado em território israelita um ataque de proporções sem precedentes, matando 1.194 pessoas, na maioria civis.\nDesde 2007 no poder em Gaza e classificado como organização terrorista pelos Estados Unidos, a União Europeia e Israel, o Movimento de Resistência Islâmica (Hamas) fez também nesse dia 251 reféns, 109 dos quais permanecem em cativeiro e 41 morreram entretanto, segundo o mais recente balanço do Exército israelita.\nA guerra, que esta quinta-feira entrou no 321.º dia e continua a ameaçar alastrar a toda a região do Médio Oriente, fez até agora na Faixa de Gaza pelo menos 40.265 mortos (quase 2% da população) e 93.144 feridos, além de mais de 10.000 desaparecidos, na maioria civis, presumivelmente soterrados nos escombros após mais de dez meses de guerra, de acordo com números atualizados das autoridades locais.\nO conflito causou também cerca de 1,9 milhões de deslocados, mergulhando o enclave palestiniano sobrepovoado e pobre numa grave crise humanitária, com mais de 1,1 milhões de pessoas numa “situação de fome catastrófica” que está a fazer vítimas – “o número mais elevado alguma vez registado” pela ONU em estudos sobre segurança alimentar no mundo.",

    "title": "Gen Zers Are Being Fired Just Months After Getting Hired – Employers Cite Lack Of Motivation, Poor Communication And Unprofessional Behavior - Benzinga",
    "text": "Gen Z workers are entering the workforce with high hopes and ambitions, but the transition isn't going as planned for many. A September survey published by Intelligent.com found that 60% of employers have already let go of Gen Z hires just months after they started. The reasons are piling up: lack of motivation , poor communication skills and unprofessional behavior are at the top of the list. Employers have also flagged issues like tardiness, inappropriate workplace attire and unrealistic expectations for quick promotions. Don't Miss: - Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you . - The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ? Recruiters and hiring managers aren't just frustrated; they're rethinking whether it's worth hiring recent graduates. One in six employers say they're hesitant to bring on new grads and some companies outright avoid them in next year's hiring cycle. According to a New York Post article, the disconnect doesn't seem limited to the U.S. Recruitment expert Roxanne Calder observes similar trends in Australia, though not as severe as in America. She notes that employers are frustrated because younger hires often fail to meet the expectations tied to their starting salaries – many of which hover around $80,000 for entry-level roles. Companies are looking for employees who can \"fire\" on all cylinders immediately, but Calder says many Gen Z workers lack the technical and interpersonal skills to meet these demands. See Also: Inspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share! In her experience, one of the biggest challenges is how Gen Z handles feedback. \"They find it really difficult,\" she told news.com.au, as the New York Post reported. Sometimes, Calder converses with young workers and then sends them an email asking if they have anything to add because she finds they struggle so much with face-to-face communication. This hesitancy to engage directly with managers and process constructive criticism creates a significant gap between employer expectations and employee readiness. Feedback has also become a sticking point; Calder notes that Gen Z workers often struggle to take constructive criticism, which can create friction with managers. Adding fuel to the fire , TikTok is full of Gen Z employees sharing their stories about being fired. Some blame rigid or outdated workplace cultures, while others admit they weren't prepared for the reality of their roles. Calder says, \"They want the dream career, but when the reality hits, it's hard to reconcile the two.\" Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence. But the finger-pointing can't rest solely on Gen Z. HR consultant Bryan Driscoll argues that the education system shoulders some responsibility. In a Newsweek article, Driscoll drew on personal experience, stating, \"As someone who went through years of education, including law school, I can tell you this: colleges are not preparing students for real-world work.\" Companies, too, could step up by offering better onboarding and mentorship programs to set young hires up for success. Driscoll warns, \"If companies keep treating them as disposable assets, we're going to end up with a workforce that's both overworked and unprepared.\" Bridging the gap will ultimately require effort on both sides . Employers need to invest in the next generation and Gen Z workers need to adapt to the demands of the professional world. Until then, the revolving door of new hires and rapid terminations will likely keep spinning.
