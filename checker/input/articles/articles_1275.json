    "text": "Solana, one of the top blockchain platforms, continues a rapid surge in its token creation. As per the data from SolanaFloor, just in March, the platform witnessed the creation of over 1.15M SPL tokens. The platform took to social media to reveal this significant increase in a recent X post.\nSolana’s Latest Minted SPL Tokens Reach 1.15M Mark in March\nIn line with the data from Solscan, the latest minted SPL tokens have seen a fluctuating yet consistent rise in their amount. This substantial figure highlights a dominant position of Solana as a blockchain dealing with decentralized applications and token generation. Additionally, in the recent 3 months, token launches touched their peak in January’s end and February’s start. In this respect, their number rose above 90,000 at some points.\nAlthough the overall amount decreased in March, the platform still saw a noteworthy daily average of more than 40,000 latest token launches. This reportedly supported the resilient growth of the Solana ecosystem. Particularly, over the recent week, the token creation went through a steady growth. Hence, from March 26 to April 1, the latest minted SPL tokens stayed persistent with a daily average amount ranging between 30,000 and 40,000.\nDevelopment Underscores Growing Adoption of Solana Based on Exclusive Advancements\nConcurrently, Solana’s NFT sector has additionally shown a remarkable activity. Throughout the week, the latest created NFTs have been oscillating from 9,000 to 18,000 in terms of number. The peak took place on the 31st of March when this number touched the staggering, single minting of 18,000 latest assets. According to SolanaFloor, the minting of up to 1.15M SPL tokens is a milestone. A key factor behind this achievement is the provision of high scalability, cost-effective transactions, and a seamless blockchain infrastructure.",

Este episodio meteorológico de apenas 12 horas de duración —obligó a decretar la alerta naranja por viento en toda la costa coruñesa— dejó a su paso un reguero de incidencias en todo el territorio barbanzano. Una de las más destacadas tuvo lugar en Porto do Son cuando dos de las paredes del pabellón del instituto se desplomaban, tomándose la decisión de suspender las clases en el centro. Fueron numerosas las caídas de árboles —especialmente afectada fue la zona de acceso a las piscinas naturales del río Pedras, en A Pobra— y el desbordamientos de ríos como el Tins en A Serra de Outes, donde el agua llegó a entrar en el colegio obligando a desalojar a los usuarios del plan madruga y a suspender las clases. Inundaciones hubo también en diferentes viviendas y locales comerciales de Muros, Noia, Rianxo o Mazaricos.\nEste último municipio fue uno de los que sufrió mayores pérdidas económicas debido a los efectos de la tromba de agua y los fuertes vientos sobre las fincas de maíz. Los primeros cálculos apuntaban a más de un millar de hectáreas fuertemente dañadas y a una pérdida de alimento para el ganado cifrada en más de 3,5 millones de euros. Si bien una parte importante del forraje dañado pudo finalmente ensilarse, falta aún por saber las consecuencias que tendrá sobre la calidad del alimento el hecho de que la planta estuviese tantos días en contacto con el suelo. Los productores temen que miles de kilos de ensilado de maíz, el alimento básico del ganado, tenga que ser desechado al estar dañado por la acción de micotoxinas.\nALVITE, LA VOZ\nN\nDos paredes cayeron en el Santa irene.

Shade isn’t a solution People living in low latitudes, including large parts of northern India, will face the most severe repercussions. Some areas are already nearing these dangerous conditions. 06 March, 2025 10:23 am IST Representational image of Delhi heatwave | ANI Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+\nA s global temperatures rise, deadly heatwaves are becoming more common. So is our understanding of how the body responds.\nExtreme heat is a well-known threat to the elderly and people with health conditions. But millions of healthy people may soon face a lethal form of heat stress, no matter how fit or acclimated they are. ‘Uncompensable heat stress’, as this is known, occurs when a healthy, acclimated person taking every precaution—resting, hydrating, and sweating—can no longer keep their core temperature in check.\nPut another way, the body cannot muster sufficient cooling to compensate—leading to overheating and, ultimately, death.\nShow Full Article\nThe body’s limit is determined by a combination of factors including air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind. Early research proposed a threshold for uncompensable heat stress corresponding to a ‘wet-bulb temperature’—a combined measure of heat and humidity—of 35 degrees Celsius. More recent work has added nuance to the wet-bulb temperature threshold, finding that the true limit tends to be lower as most people are not optimally adapted to heat.\nShade is no solution\nPrevious research has also often assumed people will escape indoors to beat the heat, underestimating the threat. But for over a billion people worldwide, moving indoors is not an option. Farmers work long hours under direct sunlight, as do those who must walk long distances to collect drinking water. What about them?\nA paper I recently co-authored addresses this question by combining a detailed scientific model of the human body’s response to heat, with climate model projections of future conditions. We incorporate the effects of sunlight and wind, which play a significant role in outdoor heat exposure but have been oversimplified or ignored in prior work.\nWe show that millions of people engaged in essential outdoor activities will face several days of uncompensable heat stress each year at just 2 ° C of global warming. At 4 ° C of warming, hundreds of millions are impacted and uncompensable heat stress events occur roughly twice as often as at 2 ° C.\nFor context, the world has already warmed about 1.5 ° C since the start of the Industrial Revolution and is headed well past 2 ° C.\nPeople living in low latitudes, including large parts of northern India, will face the most severe repercussions . S ome areas are already nearing these dangerous conditions.\nShade only partially fixes the problem. Standing under a tree or other outdoor shelter reduces solar radiation on the body . However, this does not eliminate radiation because it bounces around anywhere there is daylight. Even assuming abundant shade, the population exposed to uncompensable heat stress is more than six times higher than estimated — if you ignore radiation entirely, we found.\nImpacted communities will need to shift daytime outdoor work to night or face dire health consequences. This is easier said than don. For example, women often bear the brunt of collecting water, but it may not be safe for them to do so at night. Even if direct health shocks can be avoided by major behavioral changes, those changes will incur social, economic, and political consequences.\nI will discuss these and other related topics with international scientists and policymakers at India 2047: Building a Climate-Resilient Future on 19-22 March in New Delhi.",
