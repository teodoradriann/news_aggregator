    "text": "A man has been arrested after a police officer was spat at outside court, after an appearance by Jeffrey Donaldson. The former DUP leader has been [charged with rape and a number of other historical sex offences](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/jeffrey-donaldson-charges-court-latest-29049455). It is understood that in his letter to DUP party officers, he made clear he would be “strenuously contesting” all charges against him. READ MORE: [Watch 'chaotic scenes' as Jeffrey Donaldson attempts to leave Newry court](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/watch-jeffrey-donaldson-attempts-leave-29051669) READ MORE: [In pictures: Jeffrey Donaldson and wife Eleanor arrive at court to face charges](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/gallery/pictures-jeffrey-donaldson-wife-eleanor-29050091) Donaldson’s wife, Eleanor Donaldson, also [appeared before Newry Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/gallery/pictures-jeffrey-donaldson-wife-eleanor-29050091) to face charges in relation to the same police investigation. They were both released on continuing bail after their first court appearance after being arrested and charged at the end of March. Police escorted [Donaldson](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/jeffrey-donaldson) both in and out of the court amid a large media presence. As he left the court a number of members of the public had gathered and shouted at Donaldson. Police said an officer was spat at. A 37-year-old man described as a bystanding member of the public was later arrested and had since been released pending further inquiries. Chief Superintendent Mervyn Seffen said officers were assigned to provide a secure area and a proportionate local policing response outside [Newry court](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/newry). “There was a large media presence, alongside a smaller number of members of the public, who at times were pushing and shoving our officers to get closer to the defendants,” he said. “We appreciate the high profile nature of this case but always ask that our officers, who are on the ground to keep people safe, are treated with respect.” Police are also examining a number of social media posts to determine if any offences have been committed Mr Seffen urged people not to speculate about the case. He said: “This type of speculation along with defamatory comments made about the defendants could have a seriously negative impact on criminal justice proceedings.” The Attorney General for Northern Ireland Dame Brenda King has expressed concern at the posting of clips on social media. “In light of the events at Newry Courthouse on April 24 I am concerned about the potential impact of social media posting of recordings or commentary on the members of any jury hearing this case in the future,” she said. “Even if a member of the public did not intend to interfere with a court case, they can be found in contempt of court if something they publish creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the criminal proceedings would be seriously impeded or prejudiced. “A sentence of up to two years imprisonment can be imposed.” She added: “Users of social media should therefore take great care before posting or reposting clips or commentary and may wish to delete material at this point rather than risk proceedings being brought against them. “Further, as the PSNI has stated, it is a criminal offence to identify the complainants, who must remain anonymous. “Any posts which would be likely to lead to the identification of the complainants in this case should be reported to the police by any concerned member of the public.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/BtvqHkXhRUl8k5CCzMx9QU) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

    "text": "Just ask it to condemn Israel, though.\nThe same administration that waves a threatening finger every time Israel takes out an Islamic terrorist has nothing to say about the genocidal Muslim ethnic cleansing of Hindus in Bangladesh.\nAnd why would it? The administration and the media supported the Islamist-Marxist riots and military coup that deposed an elected government, and whose supporters have now taken to persecuting and killing more Hindus, even as the WEF’s favorite boy, Muhammad, was imposed as part of the coup to govern the place.\nMuch like the Arab Spring, nobody in the regime or the media wants to talk about what’s happening.\nKarine Jean Pierre certainly has nothing .\nQ Secondly, over the weekend, several Hindu American groups held a protest march in front of the White House urging the president that he should be taking some steps to stop the atrocities against Hindu Americans — Hindus in the Bangladesh. And, also, two of the Hindu lawmakers, Raja Krishnamoorthi and Shri Thanedar — who both are from the Democratic Party — they have also written letters to the administration seeking their help in stopping atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh and other minority groups.\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we’re going to continue, certainly, to monitor the situation. I — I don’t have anything else to — to add — to say beyond that. But when it comes to any type of human rights issues here, the president is always — has been very consistent in speaking loud and clear in public and also privately. Don’t have anything — and he’ll continue to do that, but don’t have any specific engagement to speak to at this time.\nKJP can’t bring herself to condemn the abuses. Neither can Kamala, America’s first “Indian American” Senator. But just ask her to condemn Israel and she’s got plenty of material.",

    "title": "Accused Grand Central stabber slashed fellow inmate with ceramic blade in unprovoked attack: police sources",
    "text": "The unhinged man accused of stabbing two teen tourists at Grand Central Terminal allegedly slashed a fellow inmate in an unprovoked attack at Rikers Island Thursday morning, law enforcement sources told The Post. Steven Hutcherson, 36 — who is being held on attempted murder charges in the random Christmas Day stabbing — allegedly suddenly got up from his cot in a dorm at the Eric M. Taylor Center and pounced on the 43-year-old man lying just feet away from him at around 8 a.m., the sources said. He used a 1.5-inch ceramic blade to slash the other inmate, leaving gashes across the left side of his face and head, according to the sources. A correction officer intervened quickly, pepper-spraying Hutcherson and rushing the victim to the jail infirmary and eventually to Elmhurst Hospital to be treated for the slash wounds, sources said. Department of Corrections officials said Hutcherson had been scanned for weapons at some point prior to the attack, and that none were found. The DOC was investigating how he was able to get his hand on the blade. Hutcherson — who has a history of mental health issues and also goes by the name Esteban Esono Asue — was evaluated by health officials and cleared to be placed with the general population at Rikers, according to sources. He has since been transferred to a separate Rikers jail where he will be confined for 14 hours a day and be kept away from some inmates. In a statement, the DOC said Hutcherson “slashed another person in custody inside a jail on Rikers Island. The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital with multiple stab wounds to the face and head.” Hutcherson “will be processed for rearrest for this incident. A Correction Officer quickly intervened to stop the incident and ensured the victim received medical care,” the statement said. Hutcherson was ordered held without bail at his Tuesday night arraignment on attempted murder and assault charges in the attack at a French restaurant inside the Grand Central dining concourse. The victims, 14 and 16-year-old sisters visiting from Paraguay, were enjoying a meal with their family when Hutcherson allegedly grabbed a knife and stabbed the girls, police said. Records show he has at least 17 prior arrests and at least a half dozen emotional disturbance encounters with police — as well as a string of incidents in which he allegedly violated a restraining order from an ex-girlfriend who said he stalked her and had threatened to kill her. The Legal Aid Society, which represents Hutchinson, didn’t immediately comment Thursday on the alleged Rikers attack. The City Council last week passed a controversial bill banning solitary confinement in Big Apple lockups. The Corrections Officer Benevolent Association, the union that represents the city’s 6,000 DOC employees, has warned that the law — set to take effect next year — would jeopardize the safety of officers and inmates at the jails. “Today’s heinous attack at EMTC by the same serial stabber, who attacked two innocent teenagers at Grand Central, demonstrates exactly why we need to maintain punitive segregation in our jails,” COBA President Benny Boscio said in a statement Thursday. Hutcherson is due back in Manhattan court Friday.",

    "text": "N ew minimum wage increases took effect on Monday in 22 states, boosting wages for an estimated 10 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nThe pay increases have also been adopted by 43 cities and localities and are slated to increase employee wages by a combined $7 billion per year, according to estimates from the EPI and other groups.\nNEWSOM EXTENDS FREE HEALTHCARE TO 700,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DESPITE RECORD BUDGET DEFICIT\nAt least three of the states — New York, California, and Washington — increased their pay floor to at least $16 per hour. Meanwhile, more than 45 states and jurisdictions increased their minimum wage to at least $15 per hour, according to the National Employment Law Project, amounting to the biggest victory for low-wage workers in decades.\nWhich states are affected?\nThe 22 states that increased their minimum wage effective Jan. 1 are California, which increased hourly pay to $16 per hour; Washington state, to $16.28; Alaska, to $11.73; Hawaii, to $14; Montana, to $10.30; Arizona, to $14.35; Colorado, to $14.42; South Dakota, to $11.20; Nebraska, to $12; Minnesota, to $10.85; Missouri, to $12.30; Michigan, to $10.33; Illinois, to $14; Ohio, to $10.45; New York, to $15; New Jersey, to $15.13; Vermont, to $13.67; Maine, to $14.15; Connecticut, to $15.69; Rhode Island, to $14; Delaware, to $13.45; and Maryland, to $15.\nWhy the increase?\nThe changes come as employees nationwide have struggled to adjust to higher costs due to inflation, which cooled slightly in the latter half of 2023 after rising to a 40-year high in 2022. Consumer prices have also steadily increased since 2020.\nMeanwhile, the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009, prompting new affordability complaints from millions of workers.\nProponents of a higher minimum wage have argued the federal minimum wage is far below the required amount for employees to meet the \"self-sufficiency standard,\" or the estimated income required for a family to meet its basic needs. More than 20 states continue to abide by the federal minimum wage.\nStill, the 2024 increases are a major victory for low-wage workers.\nThey also help address inflation and rising consumer costs: Of the 22 states that boosted their minimum wage on Jan. 1, 12 states approved plans that will automatically adjust worker pay for inflation each year.\nWho's affected?\nThe minimum wage increases are slated to disproportionately benefit women, who make up more than 57% of employees receiving an increase in pay, as well as black workers, who make up 9% of the wage-earning workforce, and Hispanic workers, who make up 19% of the affected employees, according to a blog post from the EPI late last month.\nAlmost 1 in 5 workers who will receive a pay boost have incomes below the poverty level, while roughly half of workers, 47%, have incomes below twice the poverty line. More than 25% of workers affected are parents.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nDespite the progress, however, advocates are pushing for more to be done.\n\"Despite continued progress by many states across the country to increase their wage floors, there are still 17.6 million workers earning less than $15 an hour,\" an assistant EPI researcher, Sebastian Martinez Hickey, said in the blog post.\nLatest What to know about the new IRS tax brackets for 2024 — and who stands to gain By: Breanne Deppisch\nNew Democratic mayor of Akron, Ohio, announces DEI and climate change team in first moves By: Christian Datoc\nDemocrats upset with Biden administration for bypassing Congress on Israel weapons — again By: Breanne Deppisch\nVideos\nTwelve days of WEX-mas: Economy — is 2024 going to be the year of the recession?\nReporter's Notebook: Biden administration's plans for 2024\nReporter's Notebook: Harvard University controversy on antisemitism and President Claudine Gay plagiarism allegations\nDearly departed: The presidential candidates who have suspended their 2024 campaigns Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",
