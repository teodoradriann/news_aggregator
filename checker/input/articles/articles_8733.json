    "text": "El cantante Miguel \"Negro\" Piñera, figura de la farándula y hermano del fallecido expresidente Sebastián Piñera, reveló que está viviendo un complejo diagnóstico, tras ser diagnosticado con grave enfermedad.\nIncluso Piñera reveló que sólo le dieron pocos meses de vida, y cómo se está enfrentando a esta realidad.\nMiguel \"Negro\" Piñera revela que le quedan seis meses de vida\nEn un adelanto del programa Primer Plano, que se emitirá este domingo 22 de diciembre, el \"Negro\" Piñera compartió detalles sobre su estado de salud en una conversación con Julio César Rodríguez.\n\"¿Cuál es el diagnóstico, Miguel?\", le preguntó el conductor.\"Leucemia aguda... un cáncer a la sangre. Esta vez la doctora me dijo: ‘Negro, te quedan seis meses’”, reveló Miguel Piñera con serenidad.\nEn el mismo avance, el hermano del expresidente se refirió a su perspectiva frente a la muerte: \"Qué le voy a tener miedo a la muerte. Aparte me voy a encontrar con mi hermano, que ya me mandó un WhatsApp: ‘Negro, trae la guitarra’”.\nEn la conversación, el \"Negro\" agregó: \"Quiero morirme sin dar pena, no quiero dar lástima. Siento que no es un mal momento para partir\".\nParalelamente, este jueves 19 de diciembre medios publicaron que Miguel Piñera fue internado de urgencia en una clínica del sector oriente de Santiago. Según fuentes cercanas, su estado de salud habría sufrido complicaciones, lo que encendió las alarmas entre sus familiares y cercanos, según [ADN](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/12/19/miguel-pinera-se-encuentra-hospitalizado-en-clinica-del-sector-oriente-de-santiago-por-urgencia-medica/).\nEl caso de Piñera ha generado una profunda conmoción, especialmente considerando que recientemente perdió a su hermano a comienzos de este mismo año.

    "text": "After a period of heavy drinking , one 40-something professional woman felt a short-term fix would not be the answer. So, instead of simply attempting “Dry January”, as many drinkers now do, she decided to abstain in December, as well.\nThat way, she reasoned, the prospect of an ascetic new year would not fill her with dread. When she stopped, she said, there was little ceremony. “My last drink wasn’t a last hurrah, I had two G&Ts, went to bed and thought, ‘That’s that.’”\nIn some workplaces, alcohol dependency is deemed more of a disciplinary issue than a health problem.\nShe found the dry spell made her healthier and happier – so much so, she hasn’t touched a drop since.\nAlcohol, she realised, had become the way she dealt with feeling overwhelmed by work and family obligations. It numbed her anxiety. And she’s hardly the only one. In the annual FT-Vitality Britain’s Healthiest Workplace survey, older workers were significantly more likely to report excessive drinking than their younger peers.\nAnd it reflects a broader generational trend. Alcohol is no longer the “norm for more recent generations of young people”, says Bobby Duffy, author of The Generation Divide: Why We Can’t Agree and Why We Should.\nAdvertisement As a Gen X-er who grew up at the time of “ladette” culture, when guzzling pint after pint of lager was seen as striking a blow for equality, I find this heartening.\nBut, while they might avoid the crutch of alcohol, workers under 35 are much more likely to report depression and burnout than the over-50s.\nThis suggests different generations are responding to stress in wildly different ways: the middle-aged numb themselves with wine and vodka, while the young succumb to depression.\nSome of the factors blamed for young people’s poor mental health are the recent COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation and unaffordable housing. In addition, there is the rise of smartphones and overprotective parenting – which experts, such as US social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, argue have made this generation of young workers less robust than their predecessors.\nA 2022 study in Current Psychology , examining how the different generations coped with the COVID-19 pandemic, did indeed find that younger people were less resilient compared with Generation X. But it added that this might not be new: past studies have found that young people are generally less resilient because they are less experienced and not as used to dealing with ambiguity.\nThe young are also more conversant with mental health issues than their predecessors, helped by increasing openness and sharing problems on social media. Duffy says they “have grown up in a time when discussing mental health challenges has become much more normalised, so it’s no surprise that they are more likely to openly identify as having those challenges”.\nAdvertisement Farimah Darbyshire, of workplace mental health non-profit MindForward Alliance, notes that “this generation does have an expectation that employers will support their mental health”. Although there are concerns that younger workers can pathologise the normal ebbs and flows of life, Duffy points out that “it’s a much better position … to talk openly about mental health challenges – that’s a clear net benefit”.\nIt also appears a better approach than trying to drink your way through it. “Older workers have grown up in a world where alcohol has been completely normalised, and used to self-medicate, or to numb out, difficult feelings,” says Janet Hadley, a human resources consultant who advises workplaces on alcohol policies.\nPeople “might not talk openly about mental health or label their inner feelings as anxiety or depression, [but] there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that alcohol is impacting the mental health of people aged 40-plus”.\nIn some workplaces, however, alcohol dependency is deemed more of a disciplinary issue than a health problem. Just 30 per cent of UK employers offer guidelines to managers on how to support staff with an alcohol problem, according to a 2020 report by human resources body CIPD.\nBut not all mental health support is effective, either. There may be more understanding by employers of how it affects productivity and more initiatives to support employees. But much of it is so-called “wellness-washing” – where perks, such as mindfulness sessions, serve as a distraction from high workloads, poor management and other structural problems.\nDarbyshire points out that only a “minority of young professionals feel comfortable accessing support at work for poor mental health”. Barriers including stigma and fears of career repercussions.\nDifferent generations might deal with their problems in contrasting ways – but it seems employers still haven’t figured out how to support them.\nFinancial Times\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Alcohol\nOpinion\nGen X\nUK\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Health & wellness Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Life and luxury",

    "text": "Israeli woman Mia Schem has said she lived through a ‘holocaust’ in her time being held hostage by\nHamas in her first interview since being freed.\nMia, 21, was among the young people snatched while partying at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe spent 54 days trapped by her captors in\nGaza – during which she underwent surgery on an injured hand, a procedure her family said was carried out by a vet.\nRecalling the operation to Israel’s\n N12 News, Mia said she received ‘no anaesthetic, no nothing’ and was left ‘choking on [her] own tears’.\nShe told the interviewer the surgeon had threatened to send her down a tunnel.\nThe tattoo artist, who also holds French citizenship, became one of the most prominent faces of the hostage crisis in Gaza following the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200.\nShe was the first hostage to appear in a video released by the group,\na 78-second clip that showed her receiving medical attention on her arm and asking to be returned home.\nMia was reunited with her mother Keren and brother Eli on November 30 following her release.\nHer aunt Vivian Hadar told media soon afterwards: ‘A vet operated on her arm.’\nFollow Metro on WhatsApp to be the first to get all the latest news\nWant to be the first to hear the world’s top stories?

Why are there children here, why is there a woman here?’\nMia was among 120 hostages released over the course of a week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that took place last month, a group largely made up of women and people with dual nationalities.\nThe head of psychiatry at a Tel Aviv hospital where some of those released were taken said they present the worst cases of trauma she has come across in her career.\nRenena Eitan told\nthe Guardian: ‘I thought that I’d treated the most severe cases there were, but with these patients that came from captivity we couldn’t believe that degree of cruelty.\n‘Most of the hostages who came back went through very severe physical and mental abuse … We know that they have a long way ahead of them.’\nEarlier this week, around 86 people were killed when an airstrike launched by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) hit a refugee camp in the centre of Gaza.\nThe country’s military said it ‘regrets the harm’ caused by the strike, saying it was targeted at Hamas operatives.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",
