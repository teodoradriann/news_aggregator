    "text": "GlucoLogic™ Functional Tea, featuring a new generation, state-of the art, partial starch/carb blocker, and improves Post-Meal Blood Glucose Responses LifeSense is the only company using patented, clinically-proven ingredient Reducose® in functional black tea (not a pill). Reducose partly blocks breakdown of food carbohydrates (carbs) decreasing glycemic index (GI) of dietary carbs. This lowers post-meal- blood glucose (BG) and insulin responses 40%! \"Fast Carbs\" become \"Slow Carbs\". Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels (more time in the optimal range of 70-140 mg/dL) reduces- insulin resistance, pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes, weight gain/food cravings, and low energy swings. Morevover, it is estimated that there up to 860 million people world wide are pre-diabetic (showing impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose) and could thus benefit from LifeSense tea! Beyond that, athletes, students, and the general public can benefit from more sustained energy provided by GlucoLogic tea.\nWAYZATA, Minn., April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- LifeSense Products is spearheading the important effort to provide novel ingredients to maintain healthy blood sugar levels to reduce- insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, weight gain, and low energy swings. \"We developed GlucoLogic tea to decrease the glycemic index (GI) of dietary carbohydrates, thus combatting energy swings, food cravings, and weight gain that our customers were experiencing,\" stated Co-Founder, Dr. Alvin Berger.\n\"LifeSense is the only company using the patented, clinically-proven ingredient Reducose, in a functional black tea format to help steady blood sugar (rather than a pill form)\" according to Dr. Berger. In addition to the large clinical trials performed with Reducose in pill form, GlucoLogic tea with Reducose was recently shown in a small pilot trial to benefically reduce blood sugar peaks, and slow the rise and fall in blood sugar after consuming starch-rich foods. The tea compliments the company's medium chain triglyceride (MCT) products, used mainly by customers adopting a lower carbohydrate (\"Keto\") lifestyle. The active ingredient in the tea partly blocks the breakdown of food carbohydrates decreasing the GI of dietary carbohydrates, lowering post-meal- blood sugar and insulin responses by an incredible 40%!\nGlucoLogic tea contains not only Reducose, but other beneficial components including the prebiotic fiber fructan, soluble fiber inulin, and black tea antioxidants (polyphenols). The functional tea comes in powder form and may be used to make iced or hot tea; and can also be added to smoothies and used in other creative ways (the active ingredient is heat-stable).\nConsumer benefits of keeping blood sugar within optimal levels using GlucoLogic include: sustained energy by avoiding blood glucose spikes and sugar crashes; cheating on low carb keto lifestyles without penalty; better weight management; improved gut health; and improved cognitive and sports performance, all without side effects.\nCurrent food labeling does not count simple starches like corn starch and tapioca starch (prevalent in gluten-friendly foods) as added sugars, but these starches are rapidly converted to glucose in our bodies, leading to high blood sugar. Most people do not include enough fiber in their diet to slow down uptake of food sugars, do not exercise enough and experience poor quality sleep and high stress. Thus, a large portion of the population unknowingly consumes excess sugar and would greatly benefit from GlucoLogic. With the advent of Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) available to the general public, people can accurately and painlessly measure their blood glucose and realize the benefits of GlucLogic.\nGlucoLogic is a product developed at the intersection of modern science and ancient wisdom. Reducose is derived from traditional mulberry leaf, with the active molecule concentrated. LifeSense tea stands out from the current crop of carb blocking and blood sugar-lowering consumer products, with delicious, non-bitter taste, robust clinical proof of efficacy, and no side effects. LifeSense GlucoLogic tea consumed with food works immediately, allowing consumers to take control of their blood sugar levels and experience improved health, all while enjoying their favorite foods again without guilt.\nAbout LifeSense® Products\nLifeSense® Products, the real scientific and technical pros in the industry are the preferred choice of practitioners and discerning customers. The company offers efficacious, state-of-the-art nutritional, Keto friendly products. The company's mission is to help people improve their weight management, mental focus and energy, and blood sugar management. Their products are currently available on their website and platforms such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart.

    "text": "Braga 1\nLazio 0\nBraga (4-3-3) : Hornicek; Gomez (44' st Ferrerira), Oliveira, Niakaté (27` pt Arrey-Mbi), Chissumba (44' st Marin); Fernandes (34' st Martinez), Gorby, Moutinho; Horta, El Ouazzani, Gharbi. In panchina Magalhaes, Sa, Bambu, Rodrigues, Noro, Barbosa, Joao Vasconcelos, Macedo. Allenatore Carlos Carvalhal.\nLazio (4-2-3-1) : Mandas; Marusic, Gigot, Romagnoli, Pellegrini (43' st Zazza); Gila (26' st Dia), Dele-Bashiru; Tchaouna (21' st Isaksen), Pedro, Noslin; Castellanos (43' st Balde). In panchina Furlanetto, Provedel, Serra, Di Tommaso, Nazzaro. Allenatore Baroni.\nArbitro : Brooks (Inghilterra).\nReti : nel pt 6' Horta.\nBraga. Una sconfitta indolore quella della Lazio in Portogallo che cade contro il Braga per 1-0 ma mantiene il primo posto chiudendo davanti a tutti la prima fase dell'Europa League per effetto di una differenza reti migliore nei confronti dell'Athletic Bilbao. A condannare i biancocelesti alla prima sconfitta in campo europeo è la rete di Horta, in avvio, che batte Mandas con un destro chirurgico a fil di palo ma non salva i portoghesi, eliminati nonostante il successo di prestigio.\nLa Lazio – prossimo avversario del Cagliari lunedì alla Domus – deve fare i conti con le assenze che tolgono praticamente un undici intero a Baroni, costretto a fare a meno degli squalificati Zaccagni e Rovella, dei fuori lista Hysaj, Basic, Castrovilli e Ibrahimovic oltre agli infortunati Tavares, Patric, Lazzari e Vecino a cui si aggiunge l'assenza di Guendouzi, rimasto a Roma per un attacco influenzale.\nUna squadra sperimentale, addirittura con Gila adattato in mezzo al campo e tanti Primavera in panchina. E che viene subito colpita a freddo dal destro di Horta che, dopo appena 6 minuti, trova lo spiraglio giusto per battere Mandas facendo baciare il palo al pallone prima di appoggiarsi in rete. I biancocelesti, però, non si perdono d'animo e crescono trascinati soprattutto dall'eterno Pedro. Proprio lo spagnolo prima pennella su punizione, non trovando il bersaglio grosso di poco, poi ci prova con un pallonetto ma finendo in fuorigioco.\nStesso spartito tattico nella ripresa con il Braga a fare la partita e la Lazio che va a folate e va a un passo anche dal pareggio: prima con Noslin, bravo a girare di testa ma trovando ancora Hornicek a dire di no sbarrando la strada con i pugni e poi con il bolide di Dele-Bashiru dal limite sul quale anche il portiere avversario riesce a toccare quel tanto per basta. Alla fine, però, non festeggia nessuno con il Braga eliminato nonostante la vittoria e la Lazio che non pregiudica comunque il primo posto. Rischia, però, di giocare, già agli ottavi, un derby che nessuno, nella Capitale, si augura.\nRIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "Amazon Eyes $2 Trillion Market Cap as CEO Talks AI, Cost Cuts Amazon CEO Andy Jassy thinks there’s \"a long way to go\" in all of its businesses and that could be good for investors. Amazon.com ( [AMZN](https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/ticker.html?ticker=AMZN)) CEO Andy Jassy issued his [2023 Letter to Shareholders](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders) this week, highlighting the company's strong performance in 2023 – a year in which its stock soared 81%. The executive also outlined opportunities the company has in 2024 and beyond. \"Overall, 2023 was a strong year, and I'm grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers,\" Jassy asked. \"These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing.\" Amazon's stock is up more than 25% so far in 2024 to flirt with the $2 trillion [market cap](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/what-is-market-cap) level and Jassy thinks there are plenty of ways for the company to continue enhancing its businesses for customers and shareholders.

Jassy said the company has identified several areas where it can cut costs within its fulfillment network while also improving delivery times for customers, including the progress it's made with its drone delivery business, [Prime Air](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/shopping/drone-delivery-takes-off-for-amazon-and-walmart). \"Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication?,\" Jassy asked. \"Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively.\" Jassy said Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw \"cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again\" at the end of 2023, and added that the business unit was seeing significant traction in its generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offerings. The executive spotlighted Amazon's international growth initiatives, saying that the company has \"high conviction\" that emerging geographies in which the company operates, including India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa \"will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\" Additionally, Jassy said [Prime Video](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/leisure/amazon-to-bring-live-mlb-nba-and-nhl-games-to-prime-video) \"can be a large and profitable business on its own.\" He also noted the company would continue its journey of commercializing Project Kuiper, which has the goal of providing 400 million to 500 million households with broadband connectivity that don't have it today. \"There has never been a time in Amazon's history where we've felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers' lives better and easier,\" Jassy said. \"We're incredibly excited about what's possible, focused on inventing the future, and look forward to working together to make it so.\" Growth initiatives are good news for Amazon investors Amazon has already generated tremendous returns for long-term shareholders. By the numbers, [a $1,000 investment in AMZN 20 years ago](https://www.kiplinger.com/invested-1000-in-amazon-stock-worth-how-much-now) would be worth roughly $147,000 today. And all of the company's future growth initiatives could keep the wind at the stock's back. What's more, Jassy noted that Amazon's free cash flow surged to $35.5 billion in 2023 vs negative $12.8 billion in 2022. \"Free cash flow (FCF) is one of the most important financial metrics you can study, especially if you're a buy-and-hold investor,\" [writes Kiplinger contributor Will Ashworth](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/602849/free-cash-flow-gushers-for-dividends-buybacks-and-more). Free cash flow is what's left over after a company pays its expenses, interest on debt, taxes and long-term investments, and if it generates more cash than needed to cover its bills, \"it can do a number of useful things with it, such as pay dividends, buy back its stock, acquire other companies, expand its business and knock out its debts.\" Related Content Joey Solitro is a freelance financial journalist at Kiplinger with more than a decade of experience.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Flames fans, players pay tribute to Gaudreau at emotional vigil There were hugs. There were tears. There were laughs. There were stories. The [Calgary Flames](https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/team-page/calgary-flames/175) held a vigil for [Johnny Gaudreau](https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/player/johnny-gaudreau/64656) Wednesday night, the former star who captivated fans at the Saddledome for close to a decade. Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, were killed last week by a suspected drunk driver while on a bike ride in Oldmans Township, N.J. Most Flames players and executives were in attendance and sat on the Saddledome’s west side steps in front of thousands of mourners. Flames general manager Craig Conroy, franchise legend Lanny McDonald, and current captain [Mikael Backlund](https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/player/mikael-backlund/103) were among speakers, talking more about Johnny the human being than Johnny the hockey player. They described a young man who was supremely talented, but also supremely laid back. “He would always say, ‘Come on, Backs, talk to the coach and get us a day off,’” Backlund said, choking back tears while laughing at the memory. “‘Come on, Backs. Have a beer. Come on, Backs. Loosen up. Come on, Backs. It’s just hockey.’ I know I’m not as chill as you, Johnny, but I’m working on it.” Backlund also spoke about how thankful he is that he made it to former Flames forward [Andrew Mangiapane](https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/player/andrew-mangiapane/116712)’s wedding this summer, where he had a chance to catch up with Gaudreau. “I feel like I’d seen him grow up first-hand, from college boy to man,” Backlund said. “Johnny would always have that smile on his face – on and off the ice. I’m going to miss that smile. I’m going to miss Johnny chirping me about everything.” Conroy, who led the organization’s contingent to sign the former Boston College star after drafting him in 2011, spoke about finally signing Gaudreau in 2014 and the flight to Vancouver for his first NHL game. Conroy had bought Gaudreau a sub to eat on the trek, but Gaudreau was craving something else. “He takes two bites of that sub…all of a sudden, he rolls up the sub, puts it under the seat, and I’m thinking, I guess he wasn’t that hungry,” Conroy said. “Out came a big bag of Skittles. For the next 25, 30 minutes, he just pounded those Skittles. I’m thinking, ‘This is the next superstar of the [Calgary Flames](https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/team-page/calgary-flames/175)? I don’t know about that.’” McDonald emphasized Gaudreau’s impact beyond the Flames and how the 5-foot-9 star inspired other smaller players to play the sport. “A hero to so many young kids across Calgary,” he said. “They saw themselves in him. His passion. His dedication. He was proof it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.” Wednesday was emotional for Flames fans. Throughout the hour-long vigil, there were chants of “Johnny Hockey.” Dozens remained at the Saddledome after the ceremony ended, continuing to contribute to the memorial. There are sticks, pucks, jerseys, dozens of bottles of purple Gatorade (Gaudreau’s favourite drink) and, of course, bags of Skittles. Gaudreau and his family embraced Calgary wholeheartedly. It wasn’t uncommon to see Johnny’s father, Guy, playing shinny hockey at local rinks. “To see all of you here, this is what makes me proud to be a Calgarian,” said Conroy, of the outpouring of support over the past week. “And this is what made Johnny so proud of this city.” The community continues to grieve the loss of a former star on the ice, who was also an integral part of the city. Wednesday was the first in a 13-day celebration of Gaudreau’s life. Backlund and several other Flames will attend Gaudreau’s funeral on Monday in New Jersey. Kieran Corrigan is a long-time Flames fan who was at the memorial Wednesday night. He said the ceremony brought up mixed feelings. “Sad and happy,” he said, of his grief and seeing the outpouring of support at the Saddledome. “It’s a whirlwind of emotions…I hope Flames fans remember him for being an awesome and spectacular guy and player.” Gaudreau ended his Flames run ninth in career goals (210), fifth in assists (399), and fifth in points (609), and will go down as one of the most electrifying players in franchise history. Off the ice, Flames staffers remember him as a down-to-earth star who never turned down an autograph or selfie request and always put his hand up to volunteer at community events. McDonald encouraged fans to remember the Gaudreau brothers as two young men who lived life to the fullest, loved their families, and treated people well. “Johnny and Matthew are leaving a legacy greater than they could have ever imagined,” McDonald said. “Farther reaching than just hockey. It extended to fans who had just learned about these brothers and their deep dedication to family as loving husbands, fathers, and sons… “Let our chants echo so loudly, the boys can hear it in the sky.”",

    "text": "For many Canadians, a look outside their window this week will reveal a gloomy sight. Grey skies are all too common in the winter months when the days are shorter than ever. So is seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\nAccording to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), SAD is a type of seasonal depression.\n“Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs during the same season each year. It usually happens in the fall or winter, but some people may experience season-linked symptoms in the summer,” the CAMH website says.\nDr. Robert Levitan is the Cameron Parker Holcombe Wilson Chair in Depression Studies at CAMH and the University of Toronto, and a professor of psychiatry at U of T.\n“SAD is a tendency for some people during the fall and winter, as the days get very short, to experience symptoms of depression,” he told Global News. It can have clear signs, Dr. Levitan said.\nStory continues below advertisement “(People have) feelings of fatigue, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal. Another part of it is overeating. There’s a lot of people whose primary problem is that they crave carbohydrates and other foods and gain a lot of weight.”\nHe added, “(Symptoms include) oversleeping, overeating, feeling sluggish, not being able to get going in the morning and then negative thinking. For some people, it can even get into suicidal thinking if they have other risk factors for depression.”\nMore on Canada Fatal falls through ice: How a ‘balmy winter’ is raising safety concerns Exiting MPs share their views on the state of politics: ‘Toxic atmosphere’ Airlines urged to inspect Boeing 737 MAX planes for possible loose bolt 10 people rescued from plane crash site in remote area of Northwest Territories The Canadian Psychological Association says SAD or Depression with Seasonal Pattern is a condition that comes and goes based on seasonal changes, appearing in the fall and going away in the spring/summer.\n“People who get this, get it every year at the same time, and they start to anticipate it. And so it becomes a recurrent form of depression. And then just like it starts on its own, it goes away on its own, of course, at some point when the days get brighter,” Dr. Levitan said.\nGet the latest Health IQ news. Sent to your email, every week. A significant number of Canadians are affected by SAD every year.\n“It is estimated that SAD makes up 10% of all reported cases of depression. Approximately 15% of Canadians will report at least a mild case of SAD in their lifetime, while 2-3% will report serious cases,” according to the Canadian Psychological Association. “People with a family history of any form of depression may also be at risk of developing SAD. Canadians are particularly at risk, as we have decreased sunlight during the winter months.”\nStory continues below advertisement Dr. Levitan cautions people against self-diagnosing, instead urging people to speak to their primary-care physician. SAD, he said, is distinct from what some people refer to as “Winter Blues”.\n“The winter blues are a wave of low emotions that come with these cold, dark days,” the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) states on its website, “You may have heard people referring to this as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), but the winter blues and SAD are two different things.”\n5:52 Health Matters: Seasonal affective disorder So with winter solstice behind us and the days getting longer, does it mean people suffering from SAD are in the clear? Not quite, said Dr. Levitan.\n“There’s a lag of about two months (after winter solstice). The worst time of year is usually February. And then it starts to get better. And the best month is usually May-June and so forth in terms of mood.”\nTrending Now Cher files for conservatorship of son Elijah, claims his life is ‘at risk’ Powerball jackpot rises to $1 billion. See how Canadians can try their luck Story continues below advertisement He added that the stress of the holiday season, which can be a difficult time for many for different reasons, can have a compounding effect on SAD.\nSAD treatment options — and misconceptions A common misconception, Dr. Levitan said, was that having regular Vitamin D can help with SAD.\n“There’s no evidence that vitamin D works for seasonal affective disorder that I’m aware of,” he said, “It’s probably relevant to your general physical health. So, it’s still a good idea to supplement if you have low levels.”\nHe said, however, that there are treatments available. This includes light therapy, where patients of SAD are exposed to commercially available lights. He said two out of three patients respond to light therapy and don’t necessarily require medication.\nHe recommends only using light therapy “under the supervision of a doctor and to make sure its ultraviolet filtered, meaning that the ultraviolet component of the light is taken out because ultraviolet light is very dangerous to your eye.”\nStory continues below advertisement CMHA recommends people “get outside during the day if you can, keep your curtains open, and when indoors, spend as much time as you can near the windows. Even if it’s cloudy, getting some daylight can help boost your mood.”\nMaintaining regular exercise and sleep schedules can be crucial to battling SAD too. But the most important thing, CMHA states, is to be kind to yourself.\n“Battling low moods is no easy feat, and it’s important to be kind to yourself. You’re stronger than you think. Remember to have regular check-ins with yourself, and to spend that extra time on self-care if you need to,” CMHA said.\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available. In case of an emergency, please call 911 for immediate help. For immediate mental health support, call 988.

    "text": "[›](/) [English](/kategori/english)›Don't Undermine Democracy Don't Undermine Democracy A series of anti-democratic actions continued to occur. The alarm has been raised by a number of pro-democracy figures.

The original article can be found in [Jangan Merusak Demokrasi](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2024/01/25/jangan-merusak-demokrasi) In the near future, the world's attention will be focused on Indonesia with the holding of the democratic party [Elections 2024](https://www.kompas.id/label/pemilu-2024?track_source=automate_body_url), next February. Where is Indonesian democracy headed? What is happening in Indonesia these days is as described by several experts in the book Democracy in Indonesia: From Stagnation to Regression? (Thomas Power and Eve Warburton, ISEAS, Singapore, 2020). After experiencing a stagnation for two terms under the administration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (2004-2014), democracy in Indonesia has experienced a setback during the era of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Since the end of his first term in office, through several political maneuvers, President Jokowi has been deemed to have systematically undermined the pillars of Indonesian democracy. According to Power, \"This trend is particularly evident in the weaponization of law enforcement by the executive, which, at the start of Jokowi's second term, had reached levels as bad as the New Order era.\" Also read: [The Decline of Democracy](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2022/12/21/kemunduran-demokrasi) After being re-elected in 2019, President Jokowi immediately took control of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), which has been a trusted institution by the public since 2003. They (KPK) are a shining star in the constellation of reform institutions. Their freedom is guaranteed by law. Therefore, the KPK has successfully captured and prosecuted more than 500 corrupt politicians and businessmen. However, after 2019, that legitimacy vanished entirely. A spate of [antidemocratic](https://www.kompas.id/label/antidemokratis?track_source=automate_body_url) actions followed. For example, there are signs of years of efforts to force the replacement of the leadership of the Democratic Party, the party founded by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), with TNI General (Ret.) Moeldoko, former TNI Commander, who is now Chief of Presidential Staff. A similar action can be carried out in September 2023, when Kaesang Pangarep, Jokowi's third child, is appointed as the leader of the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), a small party that has been known since 2014 for upholding women's participation in politics. Jokowi is suspected of forcing a revision of the election law meant to enable the removal of governors and regents/mayors in certain regions before their term ends. They would be replaced by government-appointed officials, a type of cawe-cawe that Jokowi had previously used before the term sparked controversy. (Note: the forbidden words are not present in this article.) As President, Megawati and SBY have never shaken the stability of the country through their actions that later provoked doubt about the legitimacy of electoral institutions. During Jokowi's second term in office, more and more TNI officers are being given duties in the civilian government without being required to retire first - a taboo during the reform era. This disrupts the roles of civilians and the military. It reminds us of the dual function of ABRI in practice even though it hasn't been in doctrine yet. In early January 2024, the Information and Electronic Transactions Law (ITE) was revised. According to Muhamad Isnur, the Chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, \"The revision of the ITE Law still contains problematic articles, such as defamation and defamation of character, hate speech, false information, and access termination. These problematic articles will further threaten the public's right to information and freedom of expression in Indonesia.\" Dangerous move The most dangerous action for democracy in Indonesia occurred on October 16th, 2023. The Constitutional Court (MK), headed by Anwar Usman, has granted the lawsuit that makes Gibran Rakabuming Raka (36), Jokowi's eldest son, officially eligible as a vice presidential candidate paired with presidential candidate from Gerindra Party, Prabowo Subianto. Before this, the Election Law that was in effect did not allow people under the age of 40 to become a presidential or vice-presidential candidate. Jokowi's hand was clearly seen behind the decision, as Anwar Usman is Jokowi's brother-in-law, who married Jokowi's sister on May 26, 2022. Conflict of interest was already raised at that time. Why is this act of nepotism endangering the sustainability of democracy in Indonesia? Nepotism in Indonesian politics has actually been a very common practice at every level of government in Indonesia. Latest example, the appointment of Megawati Soekarnoputri's daughter, Puan Maharani, as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the appointment of SBY's son, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, as the Chairman of the Democratic Party. The difference: as presidents, Megawati or SBY never shook the stability of the country through their actions, which later raised doubts about the legitimacy of electoral institutions.

However, the main role is played by the Constitutional Court (MK) as the owner of the final decision-making power according to the 1945 Constitution. Corrupting the MK by Jokowi could result in the collapse of democracy. The alarm is already being sounded by a number of pro-democracy figures within the country, not only by foreign experts. Mahfud MD, in his capacity as Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, admitted to receiving reports regarding [election fraud](https://www.kompas.id/label/kecurangan-pemilu?track_source=automate_body_url) in Jakarta, Bali, East Java, Central Java and North Sumatra. \"The reports I received included allegations of the installation of political party billboards by certain individuals. \"On the other hand, there was a reduction in certain political party billboards which was allegedly carried out by the authorities,\" he said (Kompas, 15/11/2023). Legitimacy of election results The next possibility that could arise is the potential rejection of election results. This was conveyed, among others, by a political observer from the Center for Political Studies at the University of Indonesia (Puskapol UI), Hurriyah. He stated, \"If Prabowo and Gibran win, all parties may think that it was a victory obtained dishonestly, so they will reject the election results. \"Once the election results are rejected, it is not legitimate (Kompas, 15/11/2023).\" Also read: [Saving Our Democracy](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2023/11/22/menyelamatkan-demokrasi-kita) In the end, my concern was sharpened by Philips Vermonte, a senior observer at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta, who is now the Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the International Islamic University of Indonesia. Vermonte has expressed his concern about the increasing potential for post-election conflict in 2024. \"Whoever wins in the first round, someone will definitely sue the Constitutional Court. \"This body has now become a public battle with exciting debate,\" he said at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a well-known think tank in Washington, United States, January 17 2024.

    "title": "Petersburg: National Park Service denies Knights of Columbus request to hold Memorial Day Mass - Augusta Free Press",
    "text": "For more than 60 years, the [Petersburg](https://augustafreepress.com/?s=Petersburg) Knights of Columbus have held a [Memorial Day](https://augustafreepress.com/?s=Memorial+Day) Mass in a national cemetery. This year, the National Park Service denied the Catholic group’s request to honor the nation’s veterans on grounds that religious services are prohibited on Park Service property, according to a new federal government policy memorandum. The Knights have requested a temporary restraining order filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond Division). The Washington Times reported that the Knights of Columbus Petersburg Council 694 has held a service at the Poplar Grove National Cemetery since at least the 1960s. Memorial Day is Monday, May 27, 2024. “The policy and the decision blocking the Knights of Columbus from continuing their long-standing religious tradition is a blatant violation of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,” John Moran, partner at McGuireWoods LLP in Washington, D.C., said. The Knights sued officials at the Petersburg National Battlefield when, for the second year, the group was not permitted to hold a cemetery Mass. PNB allowed use of a site next to the cemetery. “National Cemeteries are established as national shrines in tribute to those who have died in service to our country, and as such any special activities within the cemetery are reserved for a limited set of official commemorative activities that have a connection to military service or have a historic and commemorative significance for the particular national cemetery,” Alexa Viets, superintendent of the Petersburg National Battlefield, which includes the cemetery, said. Viets told The Washington Times that federal regulations prohibit hosting special events in National Cemeteries so as “to protect the atmosphere of solemnity, quiet contemplation and tranquility within this space.” The NPS is promoting on its website a Knights council’s annual Memorial Day Mass at Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia. Virginia Attorney General [Jason Miyares](https://augustafreepress.com/?s=Jason+Miyares) filed an amicus brief today in support of the Petersburg Knights of Columbus’. “The Biden administration’s treatment of this Catholic group is a blatant act of unlawful discrimination and violates their First Amendment rights,” Miyares said. “It’s shameful that the federal government is denying this small group the opportunity to gather to pray for and mourn the loss of military personnel who died while serving our nation. I demand that this Catholic group be welcomed at the Poplar Grove National Cemetery this Memorial Day.” A hearing was scheduled for today at 1:30 p.m. regarding the temporary restraining order. In the amicus brief, Miyares argues that the National Park Service policy is unlawful and that the First Amendment protects the right of the Knights of Columbus to hold their Memorial Day Mass gathering.",
