    "title": "ALERT DAY: Strong Storms Tonight into Tomorrow Morning",
    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) – The ALERT day is still in place for the Valley despite finally seeing much drier and calmer conditions following the rounds of severe storms that moved through earlier today. The calm conditions won’t last long as another round of strong to severe storms will impact the Valley later tonight and well into Friday morning. This has prompted the National Weather Service to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for our East Alabama Counties until 11:00 PM CT. The first round of strong storms moves in late tonight from the west and pushes eastward, meaning it’s likely everyone will see rain/storms at some point tonight into tomorrow. Since this is an overnight severe weather event for our area, it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a way to get alerts that can wake you up if any of these storms do turn severe. The main concerns for tonight/tomorrow’s severe weather are mainly pockets of damaging winds and widespread rainfall. The chance of hail and tornado is still there but much lower… BUT NOT ZERO. Plan on sporadic power outages possibly. The Valley will dry out in the late morning hours leading to a very pleasant Friday with clouds clearing out and highs in the mid-80s. The nice weather continues for Mother’s Day weekend as well! By Saturday morning, we’ll wake up to a clear sky and temperatures in the mid to upper 50s. A pleasant afternoon is expected as we top out around 80 degrees. Sunday is about the same; it looks to be just a couple of degrees warmer and a few more clouds perhaps. Active weather is possible again next week at times, especially Monday night and Tuesday the way it looks right now. Rain and storms may linger at times for the rest of the workweek.",

    "title": "Sponsored Love: Tradie Roof Racks, Rare Finds For Work Vehicles That Excel in Utility",
    "text": "The Mitsubishi Triton Tradie is a high-utility vehicle specially engineered with efficiency in mind.\nThe truck sports a spacious bed and a superior payload capacity, making it perfect for running everyday errands or going on off-road adventures. Its rugged construction enables it to withstand adverse weather while making it the highlight of the freeways.\nLike most trucks, the Triton Tradie may be subjected to several modifications to enhance efficiency. That includes getting it installed with a roof rack.\nHere’s a beginner’s guide to Triton Tradie roof racks.\nBenefits of Tradie Roof Racks Getting your Triton Tradie installed with a roof rack is an excellent way to extend the vehicle’s storage capacity.\nWhile the Tradie boasts a relatively spacious bed compared to its closer rivals like the Toyota Hilux, there will be occasions when you need to transport more cargo than the available space can comfortably accommodate. Such are the times when a roof rack can come in handy.\nA Tradie roof rack provides a platform for transporting additional items, creating more room in the truck’s bed and cabin.\nOther benefits of installing a Tradie roof rack include;\n1. Ability to Carry Bulky Items Are you planning to ferry dozens of sheet metal for your new construction project? What are large camping tents for a weeklong picnic?\nAs either set of materials can be quite bulky, transporting them in your Tradie’s bed may be exceedingly challenging. You can’t arrange them directly over the truck’s roof, as that could lead to costly damages.\nThe safest way to transport such items is on the roof rack.\nTradie roof racks are fashioned from high-strength metals, making them incredibly robust. Provided that the platform aligns with your truck’s payload capacity, you can use it to transport items that wouldn’t otherwise fit in the bed or cabin.\n2. Enhances Everyone’s Comfort Discomfort can ruin what could have been a thrilling road trip.\nNo one wants to get to their travel destination nursing aching muscles or tender bones. Sadly, that’s what your passengers get if they travel in a Tradie whose cabin is filled to the brim.\nA roof rack lets you clear your cabin space of common travel gear like suitcases and jerry cans. This creates extra headroom and legroom for your passengers, ensuring a comfortable trip .\n3. Improves Your Tradie’s Safety Safety is a critical consideration when planning any road trip. Whether it’s a short errand to a local hardware store or a daylong picnic at an off-grid location, the danger is never far away.\nFor utility vehicles like the Tradie, safety risks may be due to erratic load shifts in the vehicle’s bed.\nA roof rack minimizes these dangers by promoting weight distribution. Instead of squeezing items into a tiny corner in the cabin, transfer them to the roof rack and spread them evenly across the platform. This improves the truck’s stability by minimizing rollovers and oversteering.\nA roof rack also enhances your Tradie’s safety by keeping your valuables out of sight and (depending on the platform’s design) under lock and key. It’s an effective deterrence against muggers who may be drawn by the sight of your personal effects flashing through the cabin side window.\n4. Boosts The Truck’s Appearance A roof rack isn’t just a functional Tradie modification. It can also boost your truck’s aesthetic appeal.\nMost roof racks sport an athletic appearance.\nWhile this design is primarily intended to reduce aerodynamic drag and noise, it can also add a touch of class to your Tradie and make it the highlight of the freeways.\nChoosing the Best Tradie Roof Rack There are plenty of Triton Tradie roof racks to explore. The trick is to choose a platform that aligns perfectly with your model.\nBesides, understand the type of gear you intend to transport on your Tradie roof rack before picking the platform.\nFor instance, roof rails are ideal for transporting longer items like iron sheets. In contrast, you may consider crossbars to carry smaller luggage, such as cargo carriers and kayak racks.\nConstruction material is another important consideration when shopping for a roof rack.\nMost Tradie roof racks are made from metal, although plastic and fiberglass options exist as well. Commonly used metals include steel and aluminum.\nWhile steel racks can safely transport heavier items, their sheer bulkiness can diminish your Tradie’s payload capacity. Aluminum is reasonably lighter but no less robust than steel. It can also outlive steel due to its superior resistance to rust and corrosion.\nThe height of your Tradie roof rack also impacts the vehicle’s performance.\nTaller racks, such as mobility scooters, may be desirable for transporting longer items that must remain upright. However, a high-profile roof rack can impede access through low-hanging roadway obstacles.\nAn even bigger concern with taller roof racks is that they can raise your Tradie’s center of gravity (CoG) , increasing the risks of rollovers.\nFinal Thoughts The perks of outfitting your Triton Tradie with a roof rack are immense. From extending the truck’s storage space to improving the vehicle’s stability…there’s more to benefit from installing a roof rack on your Tradie.\nHowever, the efficiency of a Triton Tradie roof rack depends primarily on the selected platform.\nInsist on a roof rack designed specifically for your Tradie’s model. Besides, the platform should be perfectly adapted for the items you plan on transporting.\nRemember to follow the manufacturer’s care and maintenance plan for your Tradie’s roof rack.",

    "text": "India vs Australia, Brisbane Weather Forecast: Thunderstorms Expected To Play Spoilsport At The Gabba\nCheck out the weather forecast for the opening day of the third game of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series set to be played at the Gabba in Brisbane.\nAfter conceding a 10-wicket loss in the second Test, India will now look to bounce back in the next fixture scheduled to start on Saturday, December 14. The third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will be played at the Gabba in Brisbane.\nIndia started the series on a promising note with a 295-run in the opening contest played in Perth. In the second Test, a pink-ball affair, the hosts completed a quick comeback to level the series.\nrelated stories\nIndia got the better of the Aussies in the last Test played between the two teams at The Gabba in 2021. In that game, the visitors had chased down a target of 328 runs to clinch a memorable victory by three wickets. Indian players will now be eager to replicate the same show and win the Test in Brisbane once again this time.\nWeather Forecast:\nAccording to the forecast shown on AccuWeather, we can expect a fairly pleasant start to the opening day’s play but there is a 64 per cent chance of thunderstorms from 2-3 pm, which could interfere with the final session’s play. Expect temperatures to range between 22 and 28 degrees Celsius, with the humidity expected to touch the 81 per cent mark.\nPitch Report:\nThe pitch for the third Border-Gavaskar Test series can see the typical pace and bounce as the game is set to take place in the early part of the summer season. The Gabba’s curator also mentioned that there might be a bit more to offer in terms of pace.\n“Different times of year definitely make it different, it can be a slightly different pitch,\" Gabba curator David Sandurski was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.\n“Pitches later in the season might have a bit more wear and tear while ones early in the season usually are a bit fresher and might have a bit more in them. Generally speaking, we still prepare the pitch the exact same way every time to try and get the same good carry, pace and bounce that the Gabba is known for. We are just trying to make a traditional Gabba wicket like we do each year,\" he added.\n- Location :\n- First Published:\n[News](/)\n[cricket](/cricket/)India vs Australia, Brisbane Weather Forecast: Thunderstorms Expected To Play Spoilsport At The Gabba",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "Giornata Mondiale degli Animali: oltre 4300 amici pelosi accolti dal Cras",
    "text": "Da gennaio 2024, il Centro Recupero Animali Selvatici (CRAS) di Rimini ha accolto oltre 4300 animali, tra cui circa 1000 colombi, 600 tra rondini, rondoni e balestrucci, 300 piccoli mammiferi come ricci, scoiattoli e ghiri, 100 grandi mammiferi come caprioli, daini, tassi, istrici e volpi, oltre a diverse centinaia di esemplari di uccelli locali, dai gabbiani agli scriccioli. Solo una parte del prezioso lavoro svolto dal CRAS per proteggere la fauna selvatica del territorio, un impegno che diventa ancora più rilevante nella Giornata Mondiale degli Animali, celebrata ogni 4 ottobre per sensibilizzare l'opinione pubblica sui diritti e sul benessere degli animali. Un'occasione, in parallelo, per riflettere sull’importanza della protezione della fauna, un tema caro al CRAS, che si trova in via Baracchi, nella zona di Corpolò, in una struttura messa a disposizione dall’amministrazione comunale, segno di una collaborazione tra istituzioni e volontari fondamentale per portare avanti la missione per la salvaguardia della biodiversità. All’interno di questa sinergia, che vede anche il protagonismo della cittadinanza, si distingue il lavoro delle volontarie e dei volontari, persone che dedicano il loro tempo libero agli animali e ai quattro zampe, con una percentuale di successo delle liberazioni del 50%, Una storia emblematica della precisione e dell'amore con cui viene trattato ogni animale riguarda una rondine montana, portata al centro da una coppia che l'aveva trovata ferita in montagna. Era la prima volta che il CRAS si trovava ad accudire una rondine di questa specie. Dopo averla curata, era ormai troppo tardi nella stagione per rilasciarla nelle colonie locali, che si erano già spostate. Tuttavia, dopo un’attenta ricerca, i volontari hanno scoperto alcuni nidi a Ridracoli e, con grande precisione, hanno liberato il volatile in quel luogo, assicurandosi che fosse reintegrato nel suo habitat naturale. Un epilogo per nulla scontato, frutto di una notevole determinazione. E ancora, quello della realtà di Corpolò, è un impegno che culmina in tanti ricongiungimenti tra gli animali dispersi e i proprietari, tra cui molti pappagallini che a seguito di segnalazione via social riescono a tornare a casa. Non mancano poi le commoventi storie dei cuccioli di riccio, molti dei quali arrivano a Corpolò in condizioni critiche, con speranze di recupero praticamente al lumicino. Tuttavia, grazie alla dedizione e alla competenza della squadra di volontari, questi piccoli vengono accolti e curati con la massima attenzione negli spazi della struttura comunale, fino a essere salvati e poter affrontare così un nuovo capitolo della loro vita. Attualmente le attività all’interno del Cras di Rimini sono divise tra due associazioni: Anpana, che si occupa dei progetti di didattica ambientale, di sensibilizzazione ai temi di protezione della fauna selvatica e dell’organizzazione di eventi, ed Atena, fondata dai volontari piu’ esperti del Cras, che si occupa delle attività di cura.",

    "text": "El dolor lo impregna todo en el entorno de la discoteca Jet Set en Santo Domingo, un dolor que comparten los familiares de las personas sobre las que en la madrugada del martes se desplomó el techo del local -con el balance provisional de 124 muertos- y los miembros de los servicios de socorro, que trabajan a destajo para intentar encontrar supervivientes bajo los escombros.\nCientos de personas entre allegados de las víctimas, prensa, voluntarios se arremolinan en el perímetro que rodea el edificio, mientras la Policía Nacional forma una barrera impidiendo el paso a fin de que bomberos, sanitarios, todos los servicios de socorro, puedan llevar a cabo tareas de búsqueda y desescombro.\nDos grandes grúas y maquinaria pesada presiden la escena rodeando la conocida discoteca, con capacidad para al menos mil personas y que no se sabe aún cuántas podía albergar en su interior la noche del accidente, cuando disfrutaban de una fiesta amenizada por el merenguero también fallecido Rubby Pérez.\nA la espera de noticias La familia Severo Cruz espera noticias de dos sobrinas de las que no se sabe nada desde el día del accidente. Sí les han comunicado ya, dicen a EFE, que otro sobrino está muerto y ha sido trasladado al Instituto de Patología, donde el padre aguarda a que le entreguen el cuerpo .\n«Es penoso, la tragedia es muy grande», afirman estos familiares, que aún no han perdido del todo la esperanza de encontrar vivas a las jóvenes, aunque la confianza empieza a flaquear, aseguró.\nEstán apostados muy cerca de la carpa marrón en la que, fuera de la vista de los presentes, son introducidos los cadáveres que se van recuperando. De allí pasan directamente a una furgoneta del Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Forensess (Inacif) para su traslado, identificación y las prácticas forenses necesarias.\nJusto enfrente una madre da el pecho a su bebé, junto a decenas de personas sentadas en el césped de la mediana que divide la calle Independencia en dos, todas o la gran mayoría a la espera de noticias.\nEs también lo que aguarda Odalís Pérez acerca del hijo de su esposo – «para mí es mi hijo», afirma -, un trabajador de seguridad de la discoteca del que no sabe nada desde hace más de 36 horas, pero que, declara llorando, «espero que esté bien».\nNo ocultan tampoco las lágrimas dos miembros de los servicios de emergencia 911 porque «esto es muy difícil, se pone una en la piel de los demás», cuenta una de ellas, mientras su compañera afirma, impotente: «Nuestro trabajo es intentar salvar vida y no podemos».\nA pocos metros, unas mujeres se abrazan llorando: «¡Mi sobrina tan bella!. Maldita la hora de esa discoteca del diablo».\nY muy cerca un militar en estos momentos fuera de servicio habla de que hay víctimas mortales de varias nacionalidades y explica a EFE que aún quedaría por desescombrar y buscar desaparecidos en prácticamente la mitad del recinto, donde estaba la zona VIP.\nAyuda en todos los rincones Toda ayuda es bien recibida y proliferan los voluntarios y las personas que reparten comida y bebida, necesaria ante el fuerte calor que reina hoy en Santo Domingo.\nBien sabe de la importancia de apoyar a los familiares el padre Manuel Ruiz, quien junto a otro sacerdote católico intenta confortar de alguna forma a los que sufren y asegura que seguirán haciéndolo todo el tiempo, como corresponde a la iglesia.\nLos dos curas están en la misma carpa que los psicólogos que prestan una primera asistencia a quienes esperan informaciones o a quienes ya han recibido malas noticias.\nTambién ese espacio miembros de la Cruz Roja dominicana tienen los listados de posibles desaparecidos, heridos trasladados a hospitales o personas fallecidas ya en la morgue.\nHoy en Santo Domingo hay menos ruido del habitual, «la gente toca menos las bocinas de los coches» y es que «todo el mundo está como decaído», dice Juan, un taxista acerca de una ciudad que hoy amaneció con muchas nubes y lloviznado. «Es como si el sol -añade- no quisiera brillar».",

    "text": "NOTE: The following article contains content that some might find disturbing. Please read at your own discretion.\nA Missouri woman is under investigation for child abuse after reports that she traded away a foster child for an exotic monkey.\nBrenda Ruth Deutsch, 70, of Winfield, Mo., faces two charges of child abuse or neglect and one count of endangering the welfare of a child, according to prosecutors, who say they’re also investigating a witness report that claimed she tried to trade a child for a primate.\n“A witness who had come forward with some information regarding the systemic abuse that was going on in the home had said that they had been asked to bring the child down to Texas and bring the monkey back in return ,” Lincoln County Prosecutor Mike Wood told local outlet KSDK on Monday.\nStory continues below advertisement “Obviously, we have to do more investigation to see if that’s actually credible or if that’s true.”\nAccording to NBC News, Deutsch was taken into custody on Sunday, following an investigation by the Missouri Department of Social Services Children’s Division after they received an anonymous tip last November that Deutsch was mentally and physically abusing a minor .\nGet breaking National news For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.

The victim, according to the probable cause statement viewed by KSDK, told police that from September 2022 to January of this year, Deutsch hit her with wooden objects , shoes and an open hand. During one alleged assault, the victim told police that Deutsch had someone restrain her while Deutsch hit her bare buttocks.\nThe court records state that Deutsch sent the teenager “to live at a house in Texas with unsanitary living conditions and without adequate supervision ” between Jan. 1 and April 1, prompting child protective services to remove a teen from the home.\nStory continues below advertisement The documents also say that the 16-year-old would be left alone at the Texas home and tasked with taking care of exotic animals that also lived in the house.\nThe alleged victim also told police that Deutsch punished her by stealing or giving away her clothes and sent her to residential and psychiatric facilities for extended stays.\nPolice say Deutsch has fostered more than 200 children, but until this month there were no criminal reports tied to her residence.\nWood described the allegations as “particularly heinous and just disturbing to read,” especially given “the number of children that had been fostered through that home.” He said that his office is working with local law enforcement to determine if there are other victims.\nAuthorities said that after speaking with community members, they were surprised that no previous reports had emerged or criminal investigations had been launched to probe Deutsch’s home.\n“As we broke it open, it seems like apparently it was a very well-known residence that cycled through this abuse , which is really disturbing and problematic,” Wood said.\nSheriff Rick Harrell of the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office told NBC that his office was aware of the allegations but declined further comment. He said, however, that Deutsch did have exotic animals , including monkeys, at her home before she was taken into custody.\nStory continues below advertisement —\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing abuse or is involved in an abusive situation, please visit the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime for help.

    "text": "GEN-I Group put into operation a 11.8 MW solar power plant in the municipality of Kavadarci in North Macedonia. It estimated the facility’s maximum annual output at 15.5 GWh. Slovenian energy trader and supplier GEN-I Group commissioned its second photovoltaic plant in North Macedonia. The system was connected to the grid on August 8, the company said.\nThe photovoltaic facility spans six hectares on a seven-hectare lot of very degraded land. The Ljubas site is on hilly terrain in the municipality of Kavadarci.\nThe new solar power plant consists of 17,612 modules of 11.8 MW in total. GEN-I estimated its maximum production at 15.5 GWh per year. It is equivalent to the electricity needs of 3,400 domestic households, according to the announcement.\nBoth GEN-I’s PV plants abroad are in North Macedonia\nThe company also develops solar power projects in its home market and provides green energy services including the installation of photovoltaics. Earlier this year, GEN-I built the first community solar power plant in Slovenia. It said it installed more than 10,000 small PV systems in the country and two larger ones in North Macedonia.\nTwo years ago, GEN-I put into operation a 17 MW solar power plant in North Macedonia. The facility is the vicinity of the village of Amzabegovo in the municipality of Sveti Nikole. It was the biggest in the country at the time.\n“With projects like the one in Kavadarci, we are increasing our investments in renewable sources. Investments such as these are becoming more and more common in North Macedonia, as they enable brownfield sites to be used for sustainable purposes, such as the production of solar power. At the GEN-I Group, we are intensively developing projects, through the construction of large solar power plants in Slovenia as well, that give new value to degraded land through the sustainable production of carbon-free energy, even in the face of complex spatial and regulatory expectations,” Management Board President Maks Helbl stated.\nHe recalled that GEN-I was the first in Slovenia to supply only carbon-free electricity. The company trades in 24 wholesale markets.",
