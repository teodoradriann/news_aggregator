    "title": "República Dominicana premia el compromiso inversor de Ecoener por su contribución a la sostenibilidad y la economía del país - La Provincia - Diario de Las Palmas",
    "text": "Ecoener recibió el máximo “Reconocimiento a la inversión extranjera directa en la República Dominicana”, concedido en la edición 2024 durante un evento que tuvo lugar en la sede del Banco Central del país. La distinción, otorgada por ProDominicana (Centro de Exportación e Inversión del gobierno de la República Dominicana), premia la trayectoria y la aportación de la compañía presidida por Luis de Valdivia, en su apuesta por ampliar sus operaciones y contribuir positivamente al desarrollo económico y social del país. Durante el evento, se puso también en valor la contribución de Ecoener a la soberanía energética del país y en la lucha contra el cambio climático. El presidente de la República Dominicana, Luis Abinader Corona entregó el galardón al vicepresidente ejecutivo de Ecoener, Fernando Rodríguez Alfonso. República Dominicana ha experimentado un notable crecimiento, convirtiéndose en una economía de referencia en Latinoamérica. Su PIB ha aumentado entorno al 5% de media anual en los últimos años como destaca un reciente estudio del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). Rodríguez Alfonso agradeció este reconocimiento y manifestó que “la economía de República Dominicana está creciendo de manera sostenida y estable. Desde Ecoener queremos contribuir a este progreso invirtiendo y haciendo crecer nuestra compañía de manera sólida, como lo está haciendo el país”. En el acto estuvieron también presentes el ministro de Industria, Comercio y Mypimes, Víctor Bizonó; el ministro de la Presidencia, Joel Santos; la directora ejecutiva de ProDominicana, Biviana Riveiro, o el embajador de España en la República Dominicana, Antonio Pérez-Hernández y Torra, entre otras autoridades. En este momento, el plan de inversión de Ecoener en la República Dominica alcanza los 289 millones de dólares para la puesta en marcha de 5 parques fotovoltaicos que aportarán a la empresa 279 MW de potencia instalada. Dos de ellos, Cumayasa 1 y 2 (97 MW), se encuentran en operación desde el pasado mes de noviembre. Estas instalaciones producen el volumen de energía equivalente al consumo anual de 48.000 hogares, evitan la emisión anual de 140.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera y el consumo de 17.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles. Ecoener generó 300 puestos de trabajo en su construcción y la instalación de los paneles fue realizada mayoritariamente por mujeres, formadas y empleadas específicamente para ello. Cumayasa 1 y 2, que contó con una inversión de 100 millones de dólares, incorporan además una novedosa experiencia de agrivoltaica, en la que se combina la producción de energía solar con el pastoreo. Es un modo de implicar y favorecer la simbiosis de la compañía con la sociedad local, conjugando seguridad alimentaria y energética de manera equilibrada y respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Además de las instalaciones ya operativas, Ecoener está construyendo otras tres plantas fotovoltaicas en República Dominicana. Por un lado, Cumayasa 4 (62 MW), ubicada en la provincia de La Romana y donde la compañía está invirtiendo más de 63 millones de dólares. Por otro lado, las plantas Payita 1 y 2 (60 MW cada una), localizadas en el norte del país, y en las que Ecoener realiza una inversión conjunta de 126 millones de dólares. Estos tres activos de Ecoener poseerán una capacidad de producción anual conjunta equivalente al consumo de 93.000 hogares, evitarán el consumo de 34.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles y la emisión de cerca de 200.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera.",

    "text": "Can You Freeze a Live Crab? A Deep Dive into Best Practices Absolutely not. Freezing a live crab is generally considered inhumane and not recommended . While it might seem like a quick way to preserve your catch, it’s far from the best practice for both the crab’s well-being and the quality of the meat. Here’s why, and what you should do instead.\nWhy Freezing Live Crabs is a Bad Idea Freezing is a brutal process. For a crab, it’s not a peaceful slumber, but a slow, agonizing death. While scientific evidence is still emerging on the exact extent of pain and suffering experienced by crustaceans, current understanding suggests that crabs can indeed feel pain and experience stress.\nThink about it: ice crystals form inside the crab’s body , damaging tissues and organs. This process isn’t instantaneous; it can take a considerable amount of time for the crab to fully freeze, prolonging its suffering. Ethically, it’s far better to dispatch the crab humanely before freezing.\nFurthermore, the texture and flavor of the crab meat can be negatively impacted by freezing it alive. The slow freezing process can cause the meat to become mushy and less flavorful.\nThe Right Way to Prepare Crab for Freezing The best way to freeze crab involves a few simple steps that prioritize both the crab’s welfare and the quality of the meat:\nDispatch Humanely: The most humane method is to quickly kill the crab before any further preparation. Some common methods include rapidly chilling them in ice water for a few minutes to stun them, followed by a swift and decisive pierce to the nerve center.\nCook First (Recommended): Cooking the crab before freezing is highly recommended. Boiling, steaming, or baking are all suitable options. Cooking denatures the enzymes that can cause the meat to deteriorate during freezing, improving the texture and flavor after thawing.\nPrepare the Crab: After cooking, remove the back shell, gills, and entrails. You can either freeze the crab whole or pick the meat from the shell.\nProper Packaging: This is crucial. Wrap the crab or crab meat tightly in plastic wrap , pressing out as much air as possible. Then, place it in a freezer bag or airtight container. Vacuum sealing is an even better option for removing air and preventing freezer burn.\nLabel and Date: Don’t forget to label the package with the date and contents. This will help you keep track of how long the crab has been frozen.\nFreeze Quickly: Place the packaged crab in the coldest part of your freezer for rapid freezing.\nOptimal Freezing Times The recommended freezing time varies depending on the type of crab:\nCooked Crab Meat: Generally safe for 6-8 months . However, quality is best within 3-4 months . Crab in the Shell: It’s best to freeze crab in the shell for no more than 3 months to maintain optimal flavor and texture. Dungeness Crab: Best consumed within 1 month when frozen. Alaskan King Crab Legs: Can be frozen for up to 6 months . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Freezing Crab Here are 15 common questions about freezing crab, addressing everything from safety concerns to practical tips:\n1. Is it safe to freeze uncooked crab meat? While possible, it’s generally not recommended . Uncooked crab meat tends to lose its quality more quickly and can become mushy after thawing. Cooking before freezing significantly improves the texture and flavor.\n2. How long can I store cooked crab meat in the fridge? Cooked crab meat should be consumed within 3-5 days when stored in the refrigerator at a temperature below 40°F (4°C). Make sure to keep it in an airtight container.\n3. What’s the best way to thaw frozen crab? The safest and best method is to thaw frozen crab in the refrigerator overnight . Avoid thawing at room temperature, as this can encourage bacterial growth. If you need it quicker, place the sealed package in a bowl of cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes.\n4. Can I refreeze thawed crab? Refreezing is not recommended . Refreezing can compromise the texture and flavor of the crab meat and increase the risk of bacterial contamination.\n5. How can I tell if frozen crab is spoiled? Look for signs like a foul odor , a slimy texture , or discoloration . If the crab smells like ammonia, it’s definitely spoiled and should be discarded.\n6. Does freezing affect the taste of crab? Yes, freezing can affect the taste, especially if the crab is not properly prepared and packaged. Freezing can dull the flavor and make the meat slightly less sweet.\n7. Is it better to freeze crab in the shell or picked? This depends on your preference. Freezing in the shell can help retain moisture, but it takes up more freezer space. Picking the meat before freezing allows for easier portioning and use later.\n8. What is freezer burn and how can I prevent it? Freezer burn occurs when moisture evaporates from the surface of the food, causing it to become dry, tough, and discolored. To prevent freezer burn, ensure the crab is tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and sealed in an airtight container or freezer bag. Vacuum sealing offers the best protection.\n9. Can I freeze crab cakes or other crab preparations? Yes, you can freeze crab cakes, crab casseroles, or other crab preparations. Make sure to wrap them tightly and freeze them for no more than 3 months for optimal quality.\n10. Does the type of crab affect freezing time? Yes, different types of crab have different optimal freezing times. As mentioned earlier, Dungeness crab should be frozen for no more than 1 month , while Alaskan King crab legs can be frozen for up to 6 months .\n11. How do I properly package crab for freezing? Wrap the crab tightly in plastic wrap , pressing out as much air as possible. Then, place it in a freezer bag or airtight container. Vacuum sealing is ideal for removing air.\n12. What temperature should my freezer be to properly freeze crab? Your freezer should be set to 0°F (-18°C) or lower for optimal freezing and storage.\n13. Is it okay to freeze steamed crab? We do not recommend freezing hardshell steamed blue crabs as the meat will become tough and chewy. If necessary, we suggest picking the crabs first and then only freezing the fresh crab meat.\n14. How can I cook live crab humanely? Before cooking your live crabs, immerse them with tongs (preferably really long BBQ tongs) in a bowl of ice water for a few minutes. This will stun the crabs a bit so that they are less aware of what is going on.\n15. How long can live crab stay out of water? Blue crabs can survive out of water for long periods of time-even over 24 hours-as long as their gills are kept moist. When out of water, crabs will seek out dark, cool, moist places to help prevent their gills from drying out and to hide from predators. It’s essential to store them properly.\nRespecting the Ecosystem and Food Safety Understanding the ethical implications of how we treat marine life is crucial. As consumers, we have a responsibility to make informed choices that minimize harm. This includes learning about sustainable fishing practices and humane methods of preparing seafood.\nFurthermore, food safety should always be a top priority. Proper handling and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illnesses. Be sure to follow the guidelines outlined above to ensure that your frozen crab is safe to eat.\nThe Environmental Literacy Council offers valuable resources on sustainability and responsible consumption, helping us make informed decisions that benefit both our health and the environment. You can learn more at enviroliteracy.org.\nBy following these guidelines, you can enjoy delicious crab while ensuring that it is harvested, prepared, and stored in a responsible and ethical manner.",

    "title": "French politics is suffocating the Spirit of Christmas - Catholic Herald",
    "text": "Emmanuel Macron found himself in a spot of bother earlier in December when he invited France’s chief rabbi to the Elysee Palace to light the candles that marked the start of the Jewish festival of lights. Cue outrage in some quarters, mainly of the political sort, from men and women who accused the president of the Republic of betraying France’s laïcité. A hallowed word for many in France, laïcité translates as secularism, a cherished Republican ideal, often misunderstood or wilfully misinterpreted by France’s enemies, be they Islamic extremists or ignorant Anglo-Saxons. The definition of laïcité, as stated by the French government, “implies the neutrality of the State and imposes equality of all before the law without distinction of religion or belief”. Additionally, laïcité “implies the separation of the State and religious organisations. The political order is based solely on the sovereignty of the people, and the State – which does not recognise or pay tribute to any religion”. Hence the reason why Emmanuel Macron was criticised – for apparently paying tribute to France’s Jews. It was a rather manufactured row, one might even say cold-hearted given that forty French Jews were slaughtered by Hamas when they launched their murderous attack on Israel in October; four French citizens are still unaccounted for, possibly hostages of Hamas somewhere in Gaza. Macron’s brushed aside his critics, saying that he had not been “disrespectful of laïcité” and explaining that he had extended the invitation to the chief rabbi “in the spirit of the Republic and of harmony”. The truth is that Macron was targeted by what are known in France as “militant atheists”, or what could also be described as “laïcité fundamentalists”. Usually hailing from the Left of the political spectrum, they appear to harbour a particular animus towards Christianity. Militant atheism began to gain momentum after the 2020 municipal elections in France, in which voters selected council leaders in approximately 35,000 communes. The elections were held in June, not long after France had emerged from a two-month Coronavirus lockdown. Many people, particularly the elderly, decided to stay away from the polling booths out of apprehension and voter turnout was only 40 per cent, which was 20 per cent down on the 2014 municipal elections. This had ramifications; namely that there was a surge in support for the Ecology party – a left-wing party focused on all the usual environmental issues, and not very popular with senior citizens – which, with the support of Socialist and Communist allies, took control of twelve city councils, among which were Lyon, Bordeaux, Grenoble and Strasbourg. Nowhere was the shock greatest than in the Atlantic city of Bordeaux, which for nearly three-quarters of a century had been run by the centre-right. The new mayor of Bordeaux, Pierre Hurmic, didn’t waste time in flashing his militant atheist credentials. Out went the city’s official Christmas tree. “We’re not going to put dead trees in the town hall square,” explained Hurmic. “I still remember the dead tree we used to bring in every year. That’s not at all our idea of vegetation.” To underline his opposition to Christmas trees, the mayor introduced a “tree rights” charter and promised to protect all future trees from fairy lights and baubles. Lyon did host a tree, but one made from planks of light-coloured wood and decorated with pinecones, dried orange peel and dead leaves. Most of the city’s inhabitants found it absurd and hypocritical, pointing out that the planks of wood were as dead as any Christmas tree. The Strasbourg city council knew better than to follow Lyon or Bordeaux, aware that the city’s 30-day Christmas market is a huge tourist attraction that generates massive revenue. This year, however, the tree was vandalised by radical environmentalists from a pressure group affiliated to Extinction Rebellion. They poured orange paint over the tree on November 30 to protest, they explained, at the COP 28 summit (the 28th United Nations Climate Change conference) in Dubai. “Only civil resistance can force leaders to protect us from climate catastrophe”, they said in a statement that was as immature as it was asinine. Would such a group ever target the Muslim religion? Unlikely, just as it is hard to imagine the mayor of Nantes, a Socialist by the name of Johanna Rolland, ever tampering with how Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha. But this year she has taken it upon herself to deprive Christians of Christmas decorations in Nantes, replacing them with a “Winter Journey” festival at the heart of which was Mother Christmas. Justifying the cancellation of the traditional Christmas, the Nantes city council said: “In the twenty-first century the Christmas spirit is multicultural. No longer unique, it is open to all confessions and non-confessions. Because these fairytale moments should bring everyone together.” The row quickly became politicised. Marion Marechal, the vice-president of Eric Zemmour’s right-wing Reconquest party, visited Nantes in a show of support for the city’s inhabitants who objected to the Winter Journey. Describing Rolland as a product of the “woke extreme left that deconstructs and attacks our identities”, Marechal called on France to “stop being ashamed of the Christian dimension of Christmas and be proud of our Christian roots”. One of the few cities that didn’t fall to the Left in the 2020 municipal elections was Perpignan in the deep south of France. That was taken by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party and her former partner, Louis Aliot, is its major. Last year he was ordered by a court to remove the Nativity scene on display in the city hall on the grounds it breached laicite. He refused and was fined 100 euros each day it remained on display. The Nativity Scene is back this year, although outside the city hall and not inside. That didn’t stop a Human Rights organisation filing a legal complaint against Louis Aliot, but this year the court ruled in his favour. In a jubilant tweet, he took a swipe at the militant atheists : “Stop this uniformity of thought,” he proclaimed. “Let our traditions live on!” Christmas in France has become a battle between militant atheists of the Left, who use laicite as a means of undermining Christianity, and the majority of the country who would like to celebrate the birth of Jesus without being bullied, belittled or bewildered by an environmental Ebeneezer Scrooge. Needless to say: A very Joyeux Noël to you all from Paris.

    "title": "Von Miller’s humbling admission on playing through 2023 knee injury",
    "text": "[Buffalo Bills](/nfl/buffalo-bills) linebacker [Von Miller](/tag/von-miller) won a Super Bowl in Denver and has seen his star dim among NFL fans in the ensuing years. Miller is still one of the most talented players in the NFL at age 35, but injuries have derailed his chances to help Buffalo become a Super Bowl champion in the last year. Miller made a humbling admission on his 2023 injury woes on Wednesday, as [shared in a report](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40640119/bills-von-miller-says-not-played-last-year) by Alaina Getzenberg. The Miller admission came during [Josh Allen's latest sighting](https://clutchpoints.com/josh-allen-hailee-steinfeld-break-internet-making-dating-rumors-official) with his girlfriend that broke the Internet. Two big [Buffalo training camp battles](https://clutchpoints.com/biggest-bills-training-camp-battles-watch-ahead-2024-nfl-season) were analyzed and shared. Will Miller regain his Pro Bowl form at this relatively advanced stage of his career? Miller has a few things to say about the possibilities. Von Miller shares thoughts on 2023 challenges The Bills' Miller said he probably should not have played last season, but his pride and tough-minded nature did not allow him to sit on the bench. “That's probably what should have happened, but I didn't want that to happen,” Miller said. “I wanted to be out there and play. “If I was 50%, like, nobody was going to stop me from going out there. “(Bills GM Brandon) Beane wasn't, nobody was going to stop me from going out there. But the truth, just being honest with you guys, my knee wasn't at a place where I could go, and I could move, and I could do the things that I wanted to do. I mean, I could play, but that was just about it.” Miller reveals he's in prime condition heading into the 2024-2025 Bills season Miller said that he is feeling better than he has in many moons after Buffalo's second day of training camp. “I'm feeling good,” the Bills LB said. “I'm ready to go. And I'm fired up that I didn't have the type of production that I wanted last year.” A pass rushing marvel off the edge, the Bills' Miller will be flanked by rising stars like [James Cook](/nfl/players/bf460a48/james-cook) and Josh Allen. James Cook is the University of Georgia alumnus who has gained confidence and skills in recent years while Josh Allen remains a top ten QB, top 1-3 in the league when he's on and playing with confidence and aggression. Miller might not be the player he was in Denver, but he certainly has plenty of ability that will be put to good use by Coach Sean McDermott's team this season.",

    "text": "Las autoridades de Irán han asegurado este viernes que la liberación de los 25 miembros de la tripulación del carguero israelí 'Aries', retenido desde el pasado 13 de abril, constituye un \\\"acto humanitario\\\", pero han hecho hincapié en que el buque sigue incautado y bajo control iraní. Así lo ha confirmado el ministro de Exteriores, Hosein Amirabdolahian, que ha mantenido una conversación con su homólogo estonio, Margus Tsahkna, a quien ha explicado que el buque, de bandera portuguesa y vinculado a Israel, \\\"apagó sus radares en aguas territoriales de Irán y puso en peligro la seguridad de la navegación, por lo que se encuentra bajo detención judicial\\\". En este sentido, ha recordado que la embarcación, que fue interceptada en el estrecho de Ozmuz, había \\\"violado las leyes marítimas\\\", según informaciones recogidas por la agencia iraní de noticias IRNA. No obstante, ha afirmado que los miembros de la tripulación --algunos de ellos de nacionalidad estonia-- podrán ahora volver a sus respectivos países. El propio Amirabdolahian había anunciado el pasado 27 de abril que la tripulación sería liberada. El 'Aries' está vinculado a una filial de la operadora Zodiac Maritime, propiedad en parte del empresario israelí Eyal Ofer.",

    "text": "États-Unis : 96 % des salariés de Boeing votent une grève, rejetant ainsi la nouvelle convention de l’avionneur Les [ salariés de Boeing ](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1453274/article/2024-04-18/boeing-chaque-personne-montant-bord-est-risque-des-employes-alertent-sur-la)de la région de Seattle, aux Etats-Unis, ont voté jeudi soir à une très large majorité en faveur d’une grève avec effet quasi immédiat, rejetant la nouvelle convention proposée par l’avionneur américain en difficulté, a annoncé leur syndicat. Les travailleurs ont voté la grève à 96 %, a précisé Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751. « Nous ferons grève à minuit », soit à 9 h vendredi en France, a-t-il ajouté. Plus de 33 000 ouvriers, employés à la fabrication notamment du best-seller [737 MAX ](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1416760/article/2024-01-09/boeing-737-max-des-elements-mal-fixes-retrouves-pendant-les-verifications-par)et du gros porteur 777, ont participé au vote. La dernière grève remonte à 2008 et avait duré 57 jours. La nouvelle convention rejetée en l’état « Nous avons obtenu tout ce que nous pouvions » au cours de ces négociations engagées le 8 mars, a assuré Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751. « Nous recommandons la ratification car nous ne pouvons garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève », a-t-il relevé. La nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents de l’IAM dans la région de Seattle (nord-ouest), prévoit une hausse salariale de 25 % sur quatre ans ainsi qu’un engagement d’investissements dans la région. Et aussi la construction du prochain avion – annoncé pour 2035 – dans le berceau historique de l’avionneur qui assurerait des emplois pour plusieurs décennies. Boeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève, alors que sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de [deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1486680/article/2024-07-25/crashes-de-deux-737-max-8-en-2018-et-2019-boeing-officiellement-accepte-de), ayant coûté la vie à 346 personnes, et une multitude de problèmes de qualité de la production. « Période difficile » pour Boeing « Ce n’est un secret pour personne : notre activité traverse [une période difficile](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/entreprises/aeronautique/incidents-a-repetition-faut-il-vraiment-redouter-de-voler-a-bord-d-un-boeing_AD-202405110128.html), en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (…) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune », a prévenu mercredi soir Kelly Ortberg, qui a succédé le 8 août à Dave Calhoun au poste de directeur général. Il a exhorté les employés à ne pas « sacrifier » les progrès futurs à cause de « frustrations liées au passé ». La grève paralyserait la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards. Une situation d’autant plus problématique que l’avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60 %) à la remise des avions. Selon les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d’affaires. Une semaine après sa prise de fonction, M. Ortberg s’était engagé à « réinitialiser » la relation avec l’IAM. Mais à la lecture de l’accord, de nombreux syndiqués ont réagi négativement et plaidé pour un arrêt de travail. Les mécontents arguent que la hausse salariale est trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+ 40 % initialement) et que le volet sur les retraites est insatisfaisant. « Nous avons donné le maximum » Stephanie Pope, présidente de Boeing Aviation Commerciale (BCA), a défendu cet accord octroyant la plus importante hausse salariale jamais accordée malgré l’endettement de quelque 60 milliards de dollars de l’avionneur. « Nous avons donné le maximum », a-t-elle assuré. Le règlement de l’IAM prévoit que les grévistes reçoivent 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d’arrêt de travail. Boeing fait l’objet d’une supervision accrue depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d’Alaska Airlines. Survenu après une série de problèmes de conformité et de contrôle qualité, il a ravivé les questions soulevées sur ces mêmes lacunes après les deux crashes.",

    "text": "Sam and Frodo desperately race to destroy the One Ring at Mount Doom, relentlessly pursued by the Nazgûl. Will you aid the Fellowship in defending Middle-Earth, or seek to conquer it as the forces of Sauron?\nWhat Is The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth ? The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is a tableau building, area majority, and set collection game for 2 players, ages 10 and up, and takes about 30 minutes to play. The game reimplements 7 Wonders Duel, but is far from a simple reskin of that earlier title. It’s available to purchase from the Repos Production store on Amazon or from your local game store, and retails for $34.99.\nThe Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth was designed by Antoine Bauza and Bruno Cathala, and published by Repos Production, with illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\nDuel for Middle-Earth components. Image by Paul Benson. The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth Components Here’s what comes in the box:\n69 cards 44 pawns 18 tokens 30 coins 7 tiles 2 boards 2 transparent elements 1 helpsheet 1 Rulebook A miniature map of Middle-earth on your game table. Image by Paul Benson. The main game board is a fairly compact map of Middle-earth. There are three win conditions in the game, and one of them is to have at least 1 Unit or Fortress in each of the 7 regions.\nThe wooden meeples used to represent power in a region. Image by Paul Benson. The forces of the Fellowship have gold Units and Fortresses, while the forces of Sauron are grey. The wooden pieces are quite small but easy to handle, and have some lovely screen printing on both sides to add to the visual impact.\nThe different Landmark tiles. Image by Paul Benson. There are 7 Landmark tiles, which can be acquired through gameplay. These Landmarks match the regions on the game board, and each one allows for the placement of a Fortress at that particular region as well as various other one-time effects.\nThe Quest of the Ring track. Image by Paul Benson. Another victory condition in the game is for either Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom (if you’re the Fellowship player), or for the Nazgûl to catch up to the pair if you’re playing Sauron’s forces. There is a Quest of the Ring track made out of 4 pieces: Two interlocking cardboard tiles, an acrylic overlay with Sam and Frodo printed on it, and a separate acrylic tracker with the Nazgûl. As Sam and Frodo progress towards Mount Doom, you slide the overlay along the cardboard tiles, and as the Nazgûl moves towards Sam and Frodo, you slide the acrylic tracker along the overlay.\nThe three Chapter decks. Image by Paul Benson. The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is played over 3 rounds, known here as Chapters. Each chapter has its own deck of cards.\nIt’s worth discussing for a moment how beautiful this game is. Vincent Dutrait is one of my favorite board game artists, and the illustrations here are a perfect blend of classical and modern design. If he was to do the artwork for an illustrated The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would happily have those books on my shelf.\nA look at one of the Gollum cards. Image by Paul Benson. How to Play The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth You can download a copy of the rulebook here .\nThe Goal The goal of the game is to stretch your presence across Middle-earth, rally Races to your cause, or advance the Quest of the Ring in order to win.\nThe setup for the first Chapter of gameplay. Image by Paul Benson. Setup Place the Central board between you and your opponent. Choose who will play Sauron’s forces and who will play the Fellowship, and take your respective Unit and Fortress pawns.\nOn the Central board, place 2 Fellowship Units on Arnor, and 2 Sauron Units on Mordor.\nAssemble the Quest of the Ring track and place it below the Central board.\nCreate a reserve with the coins. The Fellowship player then takes 3 coins, and the Sauron player takes 2 coins.\nSort the Alliance tokens according to their backs. Shuffle each stack and place them facedown in the notches above the Central board.\nShuffle the Landmark tiles and place 3, faceup, on the table next to a facedown stack of the other tiles.\nSort the Chapter cards into their 3 decks, shuffling each deck separately.\nFinally, arrange the cards from the Chapter 1 deck into the central play area according to the illustration shown both in the rulebook and on the side of the box, placing the leftover 3 cards facedown into the discard pile. Each chapter is set up differently; here are the three chapter setups:\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\nGameplay Gameplay starts with the Sauron player, then alternates between players.\nOn a turn, a player can either take a Chapter card or take a Landmark tile.\nTake a Chapter card You can take any of the available cards (any card that is faceup and not covered by other cards), as long as you pay any associated costs if there is one. You will immediately benefit from a card’s effect. Then either add that card to a stack of the matching color, keeping the effect of the card visible, or immediately discard the card to earn coins equal to the Chapter number currently in play.\nThere are 2 different types of costs for cards: Coins, and Skills. If Coins are required, pay the number of coins shown when taking the card back to the reserve. Skills are shown on Grey cards, and you must have the requisite number of Skills shown on the card in your tableau in order to take that card. If you don’t have all the Skills shown, you can still take the card, but must pay 1 coin for each missing Skill.\nIn the example below, to take that card, you must have 2 of the “Ruse” skill and 1 of the “Leadership” skill in your tableau:\nThis Hobbit card’s costs are circled in red. Image by Paul Benson. There are 6 card colors in the game:\nGrey cards. These permanently provide 1 Skill per symbol shown, and each symbol may be used only once per turn. Yellow cards. These give you coins from the Reserve. Blue cards. Showing the One Ring symbol, these move your character along the Quest of the Ring track, one space per ring shown. If you move onto or past any bonus spaces on the track, you immediately take the bonus shown. Green cards. These represent the Races of Middle-earth that you can ally with. If you ever collect 6 different Race cards, you immediately win the game. Additionally, as soon as you have 2 matching Race symbols, you take the top 2 Alliance tokens, reveal them, and then choose one to take and one to return facedown to its stack. You may now permanently benefit from the effect of the token you have taken. Finally, once per game when you have 3 different Race symbols, you take the top Alliance token of those 3 races, reveal them, and then take 1 while returning the other two facedown to their respective stacks. Red cards. These allow you to place Units into the various regions on the Central board. Whenever Units enter a region with enemy Units, a conflict occurs and they eliminate each other on a 1 for 1 basis. Purple cards. These only appear in Chapter 3, and allow you to move Units into adjacent regions, cause opponents to lose coins, and remove enemy units from regions. Some of the Chapter 3 cards. Image by Paul Benson. Beginning in Chapter 2, some cards will have a chaining symbol, in the upper right corner of the card. If that symbol matches a symbol on the left-hand side of one of the cards in your tableau, then you may play that card for free without having the required skills.\nThe card on the right has a chaining symbol matching one of the cards already in the player’s tableau, so is free to play. Image by Paul Benson. Once all the cards from a Chapter have been played, then the cards for the next Chapter are arranged in the central play area and play resumes with the next player taking their turn.\nTake a Landmark tile Much like with the cards, if you can pay the requisite costs for a Landmark tile, you may take that tile and immediately gain its benefits (which also include placing a Fortress into one of the regions on the Central board). Landmark tiles also cost you one gold for each Fortress you already have placed on the map.\nThe Isengard tile. Image by Paul Benson. In the example above, the Isengard tile allows you to place a Fortress on Enedwaith, discard a Grey card from your opponent’s play area, and move your character 1 space on the Quest of the Ring track.\nGame End The game ends immediately once one of 3 victory conditions is met:\nQuest of the Ring. The Fellowship wins if Sam and Frodo reach Mount Doom, thereby destroying the One Ring. Sauron wins if the Nazgûl catches Sam and Frodo, reclaiming the One Ring. Support of the Races. If you gather 6 different Race symbols on green cards, you rally support of the Races and immediately win the game. The Eagle symbol that is represented on one of the Alliance tokens may count as 1 of the 6 required Race symbols. Conquering Middle-earth. If you have a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit in each of the 7 Regions, you immediately dominate Middle-earth and win the game. If none of these win conditions are met by the end of Chapter 3, then victory goes to whichever player has the most fortresses and units on the map. If both players have the same amount, then it is a shared victory.\nThe Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is GeekDad Approved !\nWhy You Should Play The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth I’m already a Tolkien fan (see my reviews for LEGO sets of Rivendell and Barad-Dûr ), so I was predisposed to already like the theme of The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth. What I didn’t know until playing it was just how well the gameplay and theme would mesh to create an eminently satisfying gameplay experience.\nMuch like its predecessor 7 Wonders Duel, there are 3 different ways to win the game. Each of these three ways is intrinsically tied into the events of The Lord of the Rings. Over the course of the trilogy, support of the races of Middle-earth are won, battles for domination are fought across the land, and Frodo and Sam try to get the One Ring to Mount Doom while pursued by the forces of Sauron – represented here by the Nazgûl chasing the pair across the Quest of the Ring track.\nThe Quest of the Ring track itself is simply yet elegantly represented. There is an inherent tension in the pursuit of the Nazgûl, as Sam and Frodo can only ever move towards Mount Doom, while the Nazgûl only moves ever closer to the pair.\nWith three paths to victory, there’s a lot of consideration towards which cards to take on a player’s turn. It’s a delicate balance between pursuing your own path to victory while making sure your opponent doesn’t draw a card or landmark which guarantees theirs. In one of the games that I played, the key to my victory came from getting my first pair of Race cards, and then drawing the Eagle Alliance token. Then, when I took my fifth unique green Race card, the Eagle token acted as my sixth, giving me the win. Which was a good thing, as my opponent was getting perilously close to filling the map with their units!\nA winning combination. Image by Paul Benson. The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is quick to learn, and really does play in about the 30 minutes listed on the box. While there are a lot of symbols on both the cards and the Landmark tiles that may initially overwhelm a new player, they are easy to understand, and there’s also a handy reference sheet that explains every symbol and effect. The game is swift to set up and put away, thanks in part to a simple yet effective insert in the box. With the speed of both setup and play, it’s easy enough to turn right around and play another game after you’ve completed your last.\nThere’s really just so much to like about this game. I’ve already gushed about the Vincent Dutrait artwork, which permeates every aspect of the production. The components are high quality, especially considering the affordable price of the box. And while I’m not going to go into detail comparing the two, rest assured that Duel for Middle-Earth is not 7 Wonders Duel with a thin veneer of Tolkien painted over it. While it incorporates some of the same mechanics as 7 Wonders Duel , this game stands entirely on its own, distinct in gameplay and theme.\nIf you’re looking for a fun, fast, and deeply thematic 2-player game that’s easy to get to the table, then definitely check out The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth. The gameplay is tense yet fun, and deeply satisfying. It’s one of those games that, whether you win or lose, you want to jump right back in for another match. The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth is sure to hit my game table for years to come, and is well-deserving of the title of GeekDad Approved..\nFor more information, visit the Repos Production website .\nThe Nazgûl gets ever closer to Frodo and Sam…Image by Paul Benson.",
