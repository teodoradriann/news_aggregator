    "title": "China Sees Value in ‘Mutually Beneficial’ Ties With Japan; Retired Ambassador Tells Story of Recent Turning Point",
    "text": "The reaffirmation of a “mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests” agreed to at the Japan-China summit meeting in November was initiated by a signal that a senior Chinese diplomat sent to the Japanese side this spring, a former Japanese ambassador to China revealed in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Wednesday. Former Ambassador Hideo Tarumi, who retired from the Foreign Ministry on Dec. 19, said the Chinese diplomat was Wang Yi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, who currently also serves as China’s foreign minister. Late in 2022, the Japanese government positioned China as “the greatest strategic challenge it has ever faced,” and it is believed that Wang intended to encourage the Japanese side not to emphasize the Chinese threat. Tarumi originated the concept of a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests, which was agreed upon by the leaders of Japan and China in 2006. Tarumi said that Wang “sent a message to Japan” this spring, aiming to reaffirm the concept. In August, during a meeting with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Tarumi proposed “the need to rebuild strategic relations” and received approval from Kishida. In October in Beijing, at an event commemorating the 45th anniversary of the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China, Tarumi delivered a speech emphasizing the need for strategic thinking between Japan and China. After hearing the speech at the venue, Wang stood up, walked over to Tarumi, and told him it was a wonderful speech. He also told Tarumi, “Let’s rebuild the mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests.” Takeo Akiba, secretary general of the National Security Secretariat, made a hasty visit to China in early November to meet with Wang and finalize arrangements for a Japan-China summit meeting in the United States. “The Chinese side was busy preparing for the U.S.-China summit, and I think, initially, they had no intention of holding a Japan-China summit meeting,” Tarumi said. “That was just in time.” The mutually beneficial relationship concept refers to a relationship in which the two countries cooperate in expanding their common interests in both politics and economics. The concept was put in writing in the 2008 Joint Statement between Japan and China.",

    "text": "Los templos se llenan de visitantes y el Arzobispo lava los pies de 12 creyentes\nSiguiendo uno de los rituales de la Semana Santa, el arzobispo de Cochabamba, Oscar Aparicio, lavó anoche los pies de 12 creyentes entre los que había niños, ancianos, mujeres embarazadas, religiosas y personas con discapacidad.\nEn el lavatorio de los pies, “Jesús que sirve a sus discípulos se pone como servidor de todos, como el signo de mayor de humildad, de amor, de servicio”, destacó.\nEl Arzobispo instó a extender el amor y el servicio a los demás. Recordó que además rememoran la instauración de la eucaristía, el sacerdocio y la fraternidad. “La posibilidad de amarse los unos a los otros que se tiene que extender a los seres humanos”, dijo.\nTemplos\nMiles de personas visitaron los templos en Jueves Santo para renovar su fe. Muchos acudieron en familia y otros contaron que retomaron esta tradición después de mucho tiempo.\n“Al visitar los templos, primero, pido perdón, luego rezo y agradezco por un día más de vida”, contó una creyente.\nLos fieles contaron que visitan entre siete y 14 templos para contemplar y acompañar a Jesús en su pasión, muerte y resurrección.\nLos caballeros de la cofradía de San Juan Evangelista contaron que participan todo el año de las actividades religiosas y solidarias de la catedral.\nLa tradicional visita se complementó con la gastronomía de la temporada como el api con buñuelo, manzanas acarameladas y bizcochos.\nOtras religiones\nLa conmemoración del sacrificio de Jesús se recuerda con diferentes particularidades en las distintas religiones, pero es una celebración común.\nLa Iglesia Cristiana Evangélica se fundamenta en la difusión de la palabra de Dios y la devoción por Jesucristo. Los días de Semana Santa se centra en la reflexión sobre los últimos instantes de vida de Jesús: su arresto, su muerte, crucifixión y su resurrección.\nLos Testigos de Jehová también conmemorar la Semana Santa a partir de sus creencias. Tienen la costumbre de reunirse el Lunes Santo en lo que llaman la Noche del Hogar para leer la Biblia y el Libro del Mormón, que es libro sagrado de esta religión.\nReligiones como la de los judíos celebran la Pascua, casi por las mismas fechas que la Semana Santa. En esta época se conmemora que los israelitas fueron perseguidos por los egipcios cuando iban al exilio. En estos días se suele evitar comer pan con levadura y se realizan servicios especiales.\nOtros credos como los adventistas que se caracteriza por guardar el sábado y no el domingo, la Semana Santa es como otra fecha, porque todos los días deben ser santos. Sin embargo, se realizan conferencias en las que se enfatiza la misión de Cristo y su sacrificio.\nMarcha\nLas Iglesias Evangélicas Unidas de Cochabamba invitaron a la Gran Marcha y Culto de Resurrección que se realizará el domingo 31 de marzo a partir de las 5:00, como parte de las actividades programadas por Semana Santa.\nEl presidente de Iglesias Evangélicas Unidas de Cochabamba, pastor Abel Molina, invitó a toda la población en general a participar de estas dos actividades que se realizarán por Semana Santa. “Celebramos la mayor fiesta solemne de la Iglesia Cristiana, no sólo en Bolivia, en el mundo, que es el culto de resurrección de nuestro Señor”, manifestó.",

    "title": "Solid case against political dynasties | Inquirer Opinion",
    "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 05:15 AM October 25, 2024 The name “Ampatuan” will live on in infamy as the clan behind the grisly Maguindanao massacre in November 2009, that saw 58 individuals, including 32 members of the media, ambushed, shot dead, and hurriedly buried in what has been described as one of the most brutal election-related violence and press killings in history.\nA court ruling in 2019 sentenced Andal Ampatuan Sr., Andal Jr., and Zaldy to life imprisonment without parole on 57 counts of murder for the massacre. Andal Sr. died in prison in 2015. While necessary to reveal the full extent of the crime, the horrific details of the killings that emerged during the years-long trial have, however, eclipsed the other crimes of the Ampatuan clan, which held sway over Maguindanao politics for several decades.\nBut a Sandiganbayan ruling on Monday drew attention to the family’s record of excess and abuses in public office, with former Maguindanao governor Datu Sajid Islam Ampatuan found guilty of graft and malversation over P400 million in public funds. Previous to the anti-graft court’s ruling, Ampatuan had a total of 272 corruption cases over similar anomalies.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Ampatuan faces from eight to 12 years in prison for graft, and reclusion perpetua, or imprisonment for 20 to 40 years, for malversation. The current vice mayor of Shariff Saydona Mustapha was also perpetually disqualified from holding any public office, and ordered to pay a P393-million fine.\nFEATURED STORIES OPINION Solid case against political dynasties OPINION All the ex-president’s men—and a woman OPINION 13 FLAG lawyers killed, FLAG @ 50 ‘Undreamed-of heights of power’ The case stemmed from Ampatuan’s misuse of funds for the construction and rehabilitation of 22 farm-to-market road projects that were found to be mostly unimplemented, with the money disbursed without public bidding. Aside from exacting full accountability for Ampatuan’s mismanagement of public funds, the ruling provides a case study on how abuses, corruption, and impunity are enabled by political dynasties. With the absence of competing forces, there are simply no checks and balance in governance.\nThe Ampatuans’ rise to power may be traced to President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who, in the mid-70s, appointed Andal Sr. as Maganoy (now Shariff Aguak) mayor to help him stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement. From being Maguindanao officer in charge under President Cory Aquino, Andal Sr. parlayed his post to become governor for three terms.\nArticle continues after this advertisement In 2005, his son Zaldy took over as governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao which consisted of five Muslim provinces. But it was in 2001 when Gloria Macapagal Arroyo became president, that the Ampatuans rose to “undreamed-of heights of power,” according to a report by the International Crisis Group. In 2006, Arroyo issued an executive order legalizing the informal private “armies” being kept by families like the Ampatuans, thus abetting the use of might for political control.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Perks and powers Aside from maintaining a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men, the International Crisis Group said the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary, and the local election commission. Despite their notoriety after the Maguindanao massacre, at least 15 Ampatuans have managed to win several elections.\nArticle continues after this advertisement It’s a familiar political scenario that happens when a few prominent families monopolize local positions for generations. One senator even brazenly described the practice as a birthright, “pinamana ng aming magulang,” a family legacy they are entitled to.\nWhile the 1987 Constitution provides that “the state shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law,” Congress has failed to pass the enabling law over the past 37 years.\nArticle continues after this advertisement A 2019 study by the Ateneo de Manila’s School of Government found that 80 percent of governors, 67 percent of House representatives, and 53 percent of mayors came from political dynasties. Why expect them to craft a law that would cut off their easy access to public office and all the perks and powers it brings?\nPoorest in the country On top of undermining the country’s criminal system by arrogating to themselves the role of judge, jury, and executioner as seen in the Maguindanao massacre, members of political dynasties exercise almost total control of government resources to enrich themselves instead of using public funds for their constituents. Proof of this is how, despite the astounding wealth of their top officials, a 2023 study found that several provinces in Muslim Mindanao remain among the poorest in the country, with 23.5 percent of their households living below the poverty threshold.\nLearning from this, the framers of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code have incorporated anti-dynasty provisions in the document to curb the influence of entrenched political families. Unfortunately for Philippine politics, the norm remains, “with great political power comes generational greed.”\nYour subscription could not be saved.

Clark made her first three shots to score Iowa's first eight points against Michigan, capped by a record-breaking pull-up 3-pointer from the logo in transition.\nClark outscored the entire Michigan team (22 points) by herself in the first quarter with a whopping 23 points, shooting 5-for-7 from 3 and 8-for-10 overall. And\n[she went on to make even more history](/news/sports/ncaab/iowa-caitlin-clark-career-game-ncaa-scoring-record) before the night was over.\nClark topped her previous career high of 46 points, which she set against Michigan in February 2022. With a 3-pointer in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Clark achieved a new career best and Iowa program record of 49 points.\nNCAAB\nShe would finish with 49 points, 13 assists and five rebounds to lead No. 4 Iowa to a 106-89 win. She shot 16-for 31 from the field, 9-for-18 from 3 and 8-for-8 at the free throw line. Her nine made 3-pointers also tied a career high.\nClark, a senior, entered Thursday's action averaging 32.1 points per game — a career-high. She averaged 26.6 points as a freshman, 27.0 points as a sophomore and 27.8 points as a junior.\nIn her senior season, Clark has taken her game to another level with massive crowds flocking to every Hawkeyes game. She has now has 16 games with at least 30 points and four games with at least 40 points. No. 4 Iowa is 23-3 on the season, poised to make another run at the Final Four after losing to LSU in the national championship game last April.\nWith 3,569 career points, Clark can now set her sights on Pete Maravich, who owns the NCAA basketball all-time scoring record for men's and women's at 3,667 points. At her current pace, Clark should have no trouble surpassing that number before the end of the season. Iowa has four regular-season games remaining before the Big Ten Tournament and NCAA Tournament.",

    "text": "护航职场“她权益” 双赢服务助发展\n转自：中国妇女报\n□ 中国妇女报全媒体记者 高丽\n“这是我们一家人的谢意！”天津市滨海高新区妇联劳动争议调解公益服务站近日收到了张莹（化名）送来的一袋老家产的小米;)。几个月前，这名在企业工作9年的38岁职场女性，还攥着月薪从1.7万元骤降至8000元的调岗调薪通知书，崩溃到声音颤抖、满眼含泪。\n当时，找到公益站负责人朱晓濛时，张莹嘴里不停地念叨：“我不能降薪！” 她哭诉道，“我父亲瘫痪在床三年了，母亲上个月刚确诊恶性肿瘤，弟弟还在读书。现在降薪，不就是逼我离职吗？” 朱晓濛在安抚她的同时反复思量，这不是一个人的困难，她背后是一个家庭。\n在与企业人力资源部门沟通时，对方无奈地叹气：“真不是故意为难老员工，业务缩减了三分之二，公司实在负担不起原来的薪资了。”双方僵持不下，难题摆在眼前，朱晓濛决定从源头寻找突破口。她连夜仔细翻看张莹的劳动合同，发现企业调岗未走民主程序，这无疑是企业的合规漏洞。\n第二天，朱晓濛带着调解员一同上门，与企业老板推心置腹地交流：“张莹在公司兢兢业业干了9年，一路陪伴公司走过风风雨雨。她现在处境艰难，况且，没跟员工协商好就降薪，要是张莹申请劳动仲裁，企业不仅要赔付更多资金，声誉也会受到影响。”\n经过两轮艰难的沟通协调，双方终于愿意坐下来谈判。最终，经协商一致，企业给予张莹合理补偿，并额外多给了3个月过渡补贴。朱晓濛还从妇联就业库中精心挑选了3个匹配岗位供张莹选择。离开时，企业主动为张莹写了一封推荐信。如今，张莹已入职新单位，月薪1.5万元，生活逐渐重回正轨。\n半个月前，高新区一家科技公司人力资源部门的负责人也心急火燎地冲进公益站。经了解，这家科技公司要优化50个岗位，15名女职工嫌补偿太低，眼看就要走集体仲裁，人力资源部门负责人有些着急，所以来公益站寻求帮助。公益站没有急于“判对错”，而是先为企业做“用工体检”，找出3处法律风险点；接着让职工代表和管理层“背对背聊天”，平衡双方利益；最后商讨出“协商解除+技能培训+岗位推荐”方案。最终48人签了和解协议。\n这两个案例，是天津市滨海高新区妇联劳动争议调解公益服务站成立100多天的工作缩影。据高新区妇联主席赵永霞介绍，公益站成立前，妇联通过走访企业，收集1200份问卷发现，78%的女职工遇到纠纷不敢开口，65%的企业希望有中立第三方介入，这促使他们打造了天津市妇联系统首个劳动争议调解公益服务站。\n截至目前，公益站已调解45起劳动争议，19人通过妇联就业库找到新工作，为13家企业完成“合规体检”。“妇联娘家通，调解平台”也已上线，扫码就能预约调解，录音、拍照上传证据材料。同时，视频线上调解让所有数据可存根，真正做到“手机点一点，娘家到身边”。\n据悉，高新区计划在年底前设立20个分站点，确保企业和职工在15分钟内即可找到“娘家”。公益站将与企业携手共建“互助之家”，将过往成功案例转化为“避坑指南”，助力更多企业规避风险、行稳致远。此外，公益站还将为女职工建立“数字档案”，借助大数据技术提前洞察风险，例如，针对降薪投诉较多的企业，提前上门预警，实现风险预判与精准赋能。",

Concerts, spectacles d'acrobates, slogans anti-français... plusieurs milliers de personnes ont célébré ce vendredi [ le départ, il y a une semaine, des derniers militaires français déployés au Niger](/defense-guerre-conflit/2023/12/22/pres-de-cinq-mois-apres-le-coup-d-etat-le-retrait-des-troupes-francaises-s-acheve). Ce rassemblement « marque la fin » des « sit-in » commencés « le 2 septembre devant la base » aérienne de Niamey, répétés « jusqu'au départ des forces françaises », a expliqué Adamou Issa, un membre de la société civile. Les Premiers ministres du Mali et du Burkina Faso Arrivés en fin d'après-midi à Niamey pour une visite de travail de trois jours, les Premiers ministres du Mali, Choguel Maïga et du [Burkina Faso](/politique/2022/09/30/burkina-faso-le-chef-de-la-junte-demis-de-ses-fonctions-les-frontieres-du-pays-fermees), Apollinaire Kyélèm de Tambéla, ont assisté à l'événement aux côtés de leur homologue nigérien, Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine.
