    "title": "Un ex-eurodeputato italiano dovrà restituire 250mila euro al Parlamento europeo",
    "text": "Bruxelles – Un ex-europarlamentare italiano del Ppe è stato definitivamente condannato dalla Corte di giustizia dell’Ue a pagare 250mila euro per frode al Parlamento europeo . Al centro delle verifiche dell’ufficio anti-frode del Parlamento ( Olaf ), l’assunzione fittizia di un’assistente parlamentare e il pagamento di somme ad una società, di cui l’assistente era l’unica socia.\nLOlaf ha aperto il fascicolo a carico di Crescenzio Rivellini (Fi/Ppe), presente a Bruxelles dal 2009 al 2014 nei popolari. L’ufficio anti-frode dell’Ue ha indagato sull’ assunzione della sua assistente parlamentare , visti i 25mila euro richiesti come rimborso per le spese e l’assenza di documenti che provassero il suo lavoro e sugli oltre 220mila euro richiesti per l’esecuzione dei cosiddetti “contratti controversi” .\nQuesti contratti sarebbero stati stipulati con una società che avrebbe prestato servizi a Rivellini durante il suo mandato. Peccato che la società avesse come unica socia la sua assistente , che, tra parentesi, era anche la compagna storica dell’eurodeputato , come lui stesso dice nel suo libro (“Bianca Maria D’Angelo era da dieci anni la compagna della mia vita”, per citarne un estratto).\n‘Bonnie e Clyde all’europea’ sono stati scoperti dall’Olaf e l’ ex-parlamentare europeo condannato dalla Corte di giustizia dell’Ue . Rivellini non avrebbe mai fornito alcuna prova dell’impiego effettivo di D’Angelo, sfruttando la presunta mancanza di chiarezza di quali siano i compiti che deve svolgere un assistente parlamentare.\nL’ex esponente del Ppe ha cercato di oltrepassare le regole dello Statuto dei deputati del Parlamento europeo , che prevede la necessità di giustificare le spese anche per il personale alla dipendenza dei deputati. I giudici di Lussemburgo hanno chiarito che “ il deputato deve in particolare produrre i documenti giustificativi relativi alle attività dell’Assistente parlamentare e, pertanto, conservarli , e ciò anche in assenza di un obbligo esplicito”.\nRivellini ha tentato di dimostrare che D’Angelo avesse un badge per entrare , ma di nuovo la Corte ha smontato la sua tesi , stabilendo che “la sola presenza fisica dell’assistente parlamentare nei locali del Parlamento […] non può essere sufficiente a dimostrare l’effettività dell’esecuzione di compiti”. In aggiunta, D’Angelo non risiedeva nemmeno a Bruxelles nel periodo in cui, teoricamente, sarebbe stata quotidianamente impegnata nel lavoro in Parlamento.\nRiguardo alle società, lo Statuto degli eurodeputati specifica che non ci debbano essere conflitti di interessi . Rivellini ha tentato di contestare la relazione tra lui e D’Angelo , nonostante il libro che diceva il contrario e che la Cgue ha potuto usare come prova. Un bell’autogol per l’ex eurodeputato, che ha scritto nero su bianco la sua autodenuncia e la presenza di un evidente conflitto di interessi.\nIn aggiunta, la validità dei versamenti effettuati non è mai stata provata dal Parlamento , mancando le “notifiche (del Parlamento) che certificano la regolarità dei pagamenti effettuati in virtù dei ‘contratti controversi'” e l’evidenza che i pagamenti fossero collegati ai contratti siglati. Per cui i 220mila euro non avevano assolutamente titolo per essere rimborsati dal Parlamento.\nDa qui la condanna e la richiesta di risarcimento per Rivellini . Il quale, ironia della sorte, durante il suo mandato europeo è stato parte della commissione per il Controllo di bilancio , che si occupa di verificare la trasparenza e la gestione efficiente dei fondi europei, mantenendo stretti rapporto con l’ufficio anti-frode.",

    "text": "Antonia Hay has had surgery and kidney failure since being infected with the deadly bacteria\nA girl has been left fighting for her life after she caught a deadly strain of E. coli.\nAntonia Hay, 17, is believed to have caught STEC-HUS, caused by E. coli O157, from food at a Christmas market.\nThe aspiring actress, has spent most of the past two weeks in intensive care, only coming home temporarily on Christmas Day.\nShe has had multiple operations, including to remove part of her bowel, and a blood transfusion as kidney failure has meant she requires dialysis, and left her feeling her “dreams have been ripped away” from her because she cannot continue her performing arts course.\nJemima Hay, her older sister, said: “She is lucky to be alive and has continued to show amazing determination and strength throughout this time, despite the immense stress, pain and trauma – all combined with an extreme phobia of injections.”\nWhile the teenager is believed to have contracted E. coli from a Christmas market in November, it is not known what sort of food led to her catching it.\nAntonia has had to give up her performing arts course because of the infection\nShe is one of 30 confirmed cases of E. coli across England and Scotland since late July 2023, with one person having died.\nMost cases occurred in December, however, which sparked the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to issue a recall notice for four cheese products on Christmas Day.\nThe cheeses were Mrs Kirkham’s Mild and Creamy Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire and Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire, which were part of Christmas hampers.\nA further notice was issued on Wednesday by the FSA for the Waitrose artisan No.1 Kirkham’s Lancashire product, all of which are made by the same company.\nCheese may have been in hampers Mrs Kirkham’s, an award-winning cheesemaker from Lancashire, makes its product in Goosnargh and is the only place in the world to still make raw milk Lancashire cheese.\n“The cheeses are sometimes sold as a full block or served as individual portions and may have been provided as part of a hamper you’ve purchased or been gifted,” the FSA said.\n“In some cases it’s been sold as part of a charcutier grazing platter. It may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”\nAlthough E. coli is often transmitted via contaminated food, the UK Health Security Agency says it “can also be spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal”.\nSteve Hay, Antonia’s father, believes it was caught from food at a local market in Great Missenden, Bucks.\n“To anyone who may have experienced food poisoning symptoms at any restaurant, establishment or any market stall in Great Missenden during the Christmas Market, particularly on or from 25 November, please can you PM me,” he wrote on Facebook.\n“My middle daughter is fighting for her life after a serious bacterial infection suspected from eating something around this time and we have strong theories, but just need to know if anyone else was affected with any level of stomach issues or illness.”\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

These units provide architects with a streamlined solution for storing many project materials, including blueprints, models, and equipment. With self-storage, architects can conveniently organize and secure their project-related items in one central location, avoiding the hassle of cluttered office spaces.\\xa0\n\\nOne of the significant advantages of self-storage units is their affordability and flexibility.

Cutting Down On Office Clutter \\xa0 \\nHaving a cluttered office filled with project materials can hinder productivity. Self-storage units provide extra space to store these materials, reducing office clutter.\n\\nA tidy workspace boosts morale, enhances focus, and increases productivity, ensuring a more organized and efficient working environment for architects.\n\\n 6. Enabling Better Resource Management \\xa0 \\nBeyond merely storing materials, self-storage units offer architects a way to manage resources effectively. By keeping a well-organized storage unit, professionals can easily take inventory of their materials.\n\\nThey can track what they have, what they\\u2019re running low on, and what they need to acquire.

Poorly packed and organized items may be susceptible to damage or become difficult to access when needed.\n\\n 2. How much does storage cost? \\nThe cost of self-storage can vary depending on several factors, such as location, unit size, amenities, and rental duration. Storage costs may be higher in urban areas or cities than in rural locations. Larger storage units generally come with higher monthly fees compared to smaller ones. Climate-controlled units and additional services may also influence the overall cost. It\\u2019s best to contact the self-storage facility directly to get accurate pricing based on your specific needs.\n\\n 3. How do you organize a self-storage unit for frequent access? \\nTo optimize frequent access to a self-storage unit, consider these storage tips:\n\\n \\n Categorization and Labeling : Group similar materials and equipment together and assign clear and descriptive labels. Categorization allows for easy identification and retrieval, saving time during project execution. \\n Digital Inventory Tracking : Implement a digital inventory management system to track items in real time. Use spreadsheets, databases, or specialized inventory management software to maintain accurate records of stock levels, usage, and restocking needs. \\n Regular Audits : Conduct periodic audits to verify the accuracy of your inventory records. These audits help identify discrepancies, prevent stockouts, and minimize excess inventory. \\n Minimize Stockpiling : Avoid stockpiling excess materials unless necessary. It ties up capital and storage space, increasing the risk of outdated or damaged items. \\n Utilize Storage Containers and Shelving : Invest in high-quality storage containers, bins, and shelving units to maximize storage capacity and keep items organized. Clear storage bins allow easy visibility of contents, further improving accessibility. \\n Adopt a Color-Coding System : Use a color-coded system to differentiate between materials or project phases. This visual cue aids quick identification and reduces errors during storage and retrieval. \\n \\n 4. What is the most common self-storage size? \\nThe most common self-storage size is a 10\\xd710 unit, which offers 100 square feet of space. This site is popular because it can accommodate the contents of a small one-bedroom apartment, making it suitable for individuals or small families. However, the most appropriate unit size depends on the specific storage needs of each customer. Some may require smaller units for a few boxes and personal items, while others might need larger units to store furniture and equipment from larger homes or businesses.\n\\n Conclusion \\xa0on Self-Storage Solutions \\n\n\\n Image Source: storespace.com\n\\nSelf-storage units serve as an innovative solution to the unique storage demands of architecture projects. From maintaining project efficiency and improving accessibility to cutting down on office clutter, these units offer numerous benefits. They present a versatile, secure, cost-effective option that architects shouldn\\u2019t overlook. With these advantages, it\\u2019s clear that self-storage units have the potential to streamline architecture projects significantly. \\xa0\n\\n",

    "text": "La abogada de OpenAI dice que su cofundador, Ilya Sutskever, tenía demasiados archivos como para revelarlos en una demanda por derechos de autor - OpenAI está intentando negociar una reducción del número de documentos que debe presentar en un proceso judicial de derechos de autor. Entre esos archivos se encontrarían los documentos del excientífico jefe de la startup, Ilya Sutskever. - La denuncia del Gremio de Autores de Estados Unidos se centra en sus alegaciones de que la desarrolladora de ChatGPT habría entrenado modelos de inteligencia artificial con libros de sus representados sin su consentimiento. Una de las abogadas de OpenAI está intentando negociar la reducción del número de documentos que la desarrolladora de ChatGPT debe revisar y hacer públicos con motivo de una denuncia por infracción de derechos de autor de alto rango, argumentando que [las últimas solicitudes que implican a su cofundador, Ilya Sutskever](https://www.businessinsider.es/openai-intenta-mantener-secreto-documentos-cofundador-ilya-sutskever-1404043), y a otros siete empleados y exempleados de la startup son demasiado grandes y numerosas. En una carta dirigida al juez encargado del caso presentada este miércoles en el tribunal federal de Nueva York, Estados Unidos, la abogada de [OpenAI](https://computerhoy.20minutos.es/tecnologia/openai-lanzara-nueva-ia-enero-todo-sabe-ahora-1418694), Carolyn M. Homer, ha asegurado que los archivos exigidos por el Gremio de Autores de EEUU a otras ocho personas sumarían cientos de gigabytes de datos \"que comprenden más de 886.000 documentos\". Entre esos ocho \"custodios\" —personas que se cree que tienen pruebas relevantes que presentar en el proceso de revelación previo al juicio— se encuentran Sutskever, antiguo científico jefe y cofundador de la startup de inteligencia artificial, y [Jan Leike](https://www.businessinsider.es/otro-directivo-openai-acaba-anunciar-marcha-1386587), el investigador de OpenAI que abandonó la empresa en mayo de este año para irse a la competencia, Anthropic. La demanda del Gremio de Autores se centra en las alegaciones de que los modelos de la desarrolladora de ChatGPT se habrían entrenado con libros sin el consentimiento de sus escritores. Homer también ha nombrado a otros custodios que se están viendo afectados por la denuncia, entre ellos los miembros del personal técnico de OpenAI, Chelsea Voss, Shantanu Jani y Jong Wook Kim, el responsable de los datos de preentrenamiento, Qiming Yuan, y los extrabajadores, Andrew Mayne y Cullen O'Keefe. La compañía dirigida por [Sam Altman](https://www.businessinsider.es/tecnologia/sam-altman-agradece-elon-musk-ayuda-inversion-inicial-openai-dice-avecinan-buenos-tiempos-fundadores-tecnologicos-1418278) ya ha accedido a presentar archivos de 24 custodios, pero se opone a los parámetros de búsqueda propuestos y a las peticiones de presentar documentos de ocho nuevos custodios por temor a que sus archivos aumenten significativamente los recursos necesarios para examinarlos. Según la abogada de OpenAI, la revisión de los 24 custodios existentes por parte de la empresa, basada en sus propios términos de búsqueda propuestos, le exigiría analizar \"más de 460.000 documentos\" que suman 359 gigabytes. Homer ha afirmado que, utilizando los términos propuestos por el Gremio de Autores, la compañía de IA necesitaría revisar más de 1 millón de documentos. Al tener en cuenta los términos de búsqueda propuestos por OpenAI para los ocho custodios en disputa, la abogada ha señalado que el tamaño de los archivos sería de más de 375 gigabytes, superando el tamaño de los archivos de los 24 custodios ya acordados por ambas partes. Homer también ha expresado que la desarrolladora de ChatGPT estimó una tasa de duplicación del 71% basándose en los términos de búsqueda propuestos entre los ocho custodios en disputa y los 24 existentes. La abogada de OpenAI ha indicado que el \"importante volumen de consultas\", así como la preocupación por las altas tasas de duplicación, supone que la organización va a seguir intentando llegar a un acuerdo con los demandantes con respecto a los archivos de Sutskever y los otros custodios en disputa. Esta polémica marca el último avance en la demanda colectiva presentada por el Gremio de Autores contra OpenAI. Documentos no confidenciales a los que [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-destroyed-ai-training-datasets-lawsuit-authors-books-copyright-2024-5) tuvo acceso hace unos meses revelaron que la startup eliminó dos conjuntos de datos, \"books1\" y \"books2\", que fueron utilizados para entrenar su anterior modelo de inteligencia artificial, [GPT-3](https://www.businessinsider.es/openai-lanza-mejor-herramienta-lenguaje-artificial-escrito-682351). OpenAI también se enfrenta a otros casos de posible infracción de derechos de autor, incluido [uno presentado por el New York Times](https://www.businessinsider.es/abogados-new-york-times-estan-inspeccionando-sala-secreta-codigo-openai-1410913). Los abogados del Gremio de Autores estadounidense han declarado que los conjuntos de datos utilizados por la empresa de Altman pueden haber incluido \"más de 100.000 libros publicados\". Este medio de comunicación ha tratado de ponerse en contacto con OpenAI y con el Gremio de Autores de Estados Unidos, pero de momento no ha obtenido respuesta.
