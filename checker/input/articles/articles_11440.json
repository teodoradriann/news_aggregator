    "text": "Headline: New Weather Warnings Issued as Spain Faces Flooding Crisis\nFlood Catastrophe in Spain Claims 158 Lives, More Rain Ahead\nA relentless wave of extreme weather has enveloped Spain, compounding catastrophe in a nation grappling with the aftermath of devastating floods. With over 158 fatalities reported thus far, officials have now issued new weather warnings, instilling a sense of urgency in an already distressed populace. As meteorologists project continued severe rainfall, particularly in the Valencia region , residents are bracing for further potential loss of life.\nThe National Meteorological Agency of Spain has designated a red alert for several areas, warning that the same powerful storms responsible for the initial deluge are set to return. \"We urge residents to prepare for the worst as more rain is anticipated,\" stated a spokesperson for the agency. The situation has led emergency services to mobilize resources, conducting rescue operations and delivering essential supplies to the most affected zones.\nA Catastrophe Unfolds: Who and What Happened?\nThe calamity unfolded over the past week as torrential downpours, influenced by a particularly aggressive weather system, inundated cities and towns throughout Spain. Initial reports from regional authorities indicate that numerous structures have been completely submerged, and some residents have been trapped in their homes or vehicles. Eyewitness accounts describe harrowing scenes of community despair.\nOne Irish teacher based near Valencia recounted, “We’re surrounded by water, and the destruction is beyond comprehension. It felt like the world was ending.” Her testimony highlights the astonishing force of nature that has caught many by surprise. Survivors are coming to terms with the devastation as they mourn the loss of friends and family members.\nThe Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez , has pledged to provide support to both individuals and local businesses affected by the flooding. \"We will mobilize all available resources to ensure that our people have the aid they need during this difficult time,\" Sánchez said.\nCommunity Response: Farmers and Neighbors Unite\nIn these challenging times, local farmers and community members have stepped up to assist in the recovery. They are actively helping authorities clear damage in agricultural areas severely affected by flash floods. “We know our land better than anyone and are committed to restoring what we can,” stated José Martínez, a farmer in the hardest-hit region.\nTheir efforts signal resilience amidst despair as they confront the immediate aftermath and start planning for the longer-term recovery of affected agricultural practices. With many crops ruined, the economic implications could be significant, affecting local markets and supply chains across Spain.\nBeyond the Surface: The Broader Impact of the Flooding\nThe implications of these floods are not just immediate but will resonate for months and years to come. As authorities assess the damage and work to aid recovery, there are growing concerns about the economic ramifications of such natural disasters. Agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure are all sectors that could face prolonged impacts.\nLocal businesses are expressing anxiety as they ponder their future in the wake of the destruction. The damage assessment process is underway, but many fear it could take years for the region to fully recover. \"The economic impact will be felt for a long time. Each business’s future is uncertain at this point,\" noted Mark González, an economist specializing in disaster recovery.\nExpert Opinions and Predictions for the Future\nExperts in climatology emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change to mitigate the severity of such weather patterns in the future. “We cannot overlook the reality that these weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change,\" commented Dr. Elena Ruiz, a climate scientist.\nShe advocates for comprehensive policy reforms that target environmental sustainability and disaster resilience. “Now more than ever, we need to prepare our infrastructure and strengthen our communities to withstand such events.”\nMoving Forward: Community Resilience and Recovery Efforts\nThe path to recovery will demand immense collective effort and resource mobilization. Community groups are already forming to assist those affected, providing food, shelter, and emotional support.\nEmergency response teams continue search and rescue operations, and local authorities are prioritizing the establishment of safe zones for affected residents. The Red Cross has activated a relief program designed to assist families with essential goods.\nCall to Action: Join the Conversation\nIn light of this unfolding tragedy, we invite our readers to share their thoughts, experiences, or support for those affected. How can communities worldwide prepare for similar disasters? What roles do we play in aiding our neighbors?\nLet us know in the comments section below.

    "title": "Five teams in the US LBM Coaches Poll pose a huge threat to USC",
    "text": "USA TODAY Sports released its 2024 Preseason US LBM Coaches Poll on Monday. USC was placed right outside the top 20 at No. 23 overall.\nThe US LBM Coaches Poll is voted on by a panel of AFCA-member FBS head coaches who are chosen from a pool of coaches willing to participate. Each coach submits a Top 25 team rankings list weekly, with a first-place vote worth 25 points, second-place worth 24 points, and so on. This year’s panel includes 55 coaches from across the country, representing the major conferences and independent schools that will be competing this season. The coaches ranking results are published by USA TODAY Sports online on Sundays and in print on Mondays during the college football season.\nThis will be the longest season in college football history with the start of an expanded College Football Playoff system that features 12 teams competing in the playoff tournament.\nHere’s a look at the full preseason US LBM Coaches Poll from USA TODAY Sports:\nRank Team Points 1st Place Votes 1 Georgia 1,364 46 2 Ohio State 1,302 7 3 Oregon 1,228 — 4 Texas 1,223 1 5 Alabama 1,077 – 6 Ole Miss 1,019 – 7 Notre Dame 969 – 8 Michigan 944 1 9 Penn State 889 – 10 Florida State 867 – 11 Missouri 808 – 12 LSU 742 – 13 Utah 665 – 14 Clemson 657 – 15 Tennessee 621 – 16 Oklahoma 609 – 17 Kansas State 416 – 18 Oklahoma State 359 – 19 Miami (Fl) 292 – 20 Texas A&M 273 – 21 Arizona 230 – 22 North Carolina State 216 – 23 USC 199 – 24 Kansas 186 – 25 Iowa 144 – Others Receiving Votes Washington 123; Louisville 95; Virginia Tech 64; SMU 47; Memphis 44; Boise State 30; Auburn 25; West Virginia 22; Wisconsin 17; Liberty 15; Iowa State 15; Kentucky 12; Florida 11; South Carolina 10; North Carolina 6; UNLV 5; Maryland 5; UCF 4; Texas Tech 4; UTSA 3; Tulane 2; Texas State 2; Nebraska 2; Colorado 2; Appalachian State 2; Troy 1; Syracuse 1; Miami (OH) 1; James Madison 1; Air Force 1\nYou may be wondering who are the biggest threats to USC this season in the top 25 of the preseason polls. Let’s take a deeper dive as we rank the hardest teams in the path for the Trojans in 2024.\n1. Penn State Nittany Lions\nMatthew O’Haren-USA TODAY Sports\nNo. 9 Penn State is the biggest threat to beat USC and keep the Trojans out of the Big Ten and CFB Playoff races this year.\nHead coach James Franklin begins his 11th season as Penn State’s head coach with a roster that returns 16 starters, including seven each on offense and defense led by quarterback Drew Allar.\n2. Notre Dame Fighting Irish\nMatt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports\nNo.7 Notre Dame is the highest-ranked team on USC’s 2024 schedule, relative to the preseason US LBM Coaches Poll. After the loss at the Fighting Irish last season, USC is looking for major revenge in a game that could decide the outcome of its season.\n Marcus Freeman’s Irish are coming off a 10-3 season and a No. 14 final ranking in 2023. They face Texas A&M to open the season.\n3. Michigan Wolverines\nTroy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Michigan Wolverines come in at No. 8 in the preseason poll. The Wolverines have 944 points and received one first-place vote.\nThere are four Big Ten teams ranked inside the top 10 of the US LBM Coaches Poll heading into the 2024 season. Two teams in the conference are ranked inside the top five. There are six Big Ten teams ranked in the top 25 to start the year.\nThe defending national champs are coming off a 15-0 season but lost J.J. McCarthy, Blake Corum and head coach Jim Harbaugh.\nMichigan hosts the USC Trojans in the “Big House” on September 21 in a game where we will find out a lot about both teams.\n4. LSU Tigers\nMatthew Dobbins-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Trojans open this season against the LSU Tigers on Sept. 1 inside Allegiant Stadium in the Vegas Kickoff Classic. This is one of the most highly anticapted games of the season.\nBrian Kelly is entering his third season as LSU’s coach. He is looking to be an SEC and national championship contender; it starts in Vegas. Kelly will have to replace three first-round picks in Malik Nabers, Jayden Daniels, and Brian Thomas Jr.\n5. Ohio State Buckeyes\nUSA TODAY Sports Syndication — Columbus Dispatch\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes are the No.1 team in the nation. Though they do not play USC in the regular season schedule, Ohio State is still a huge threat to the Trojans in the conference and national landscapes.\nThey could meet either in the Big Ten Championship Game or the the 12-team CFB Playoff. Either way, Ohio State is expected to set the standard in the conference for football in 2024.",

    "text": "Igor Babuschkin, co-founder of Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has announced his resignation. In a long post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) Babuschkin reflected on his journey from a being a physics student to becoming a co-founder and building xAI.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now He described the experience as “the most exhilarating time of our lives,” likening his departure to “a proud parent driving away after sending their kid to college”. He also revealed his early days at xAI were not easy as starting an AI company from scratch required lot of hard work. Read xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin’s resignation post here Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023. I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold.\nWe both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed. Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream. My parents left the Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR in search of a better life for their kids. Life wasn’t always easy as immigrants. Despite the hardships, my parents believed that human values were priceless: values like courage, compassion, curiosity for understanding the world.\nAs a child, I admired scientists like Richard Feynman and Max Planck , who relentlessly pushed the frontiers of physics in order to understand the universe. As a particle physics PhD student at CERN I was excited to contribute to that mission. But the search for new physics was getting harder and harder, requiring bigger and bigger colliders, while new discoveries kept getting fewer. So I began to wonder if superintelligence, not larger colliders, could be the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Could AI develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity? Could AI prove the Riemann hypothesis? In early 2023 I became convinced that we were getting close to a recipe for superintelligence. I saw the writing on the wall: very soon AI could reason beyond the level of humans. How could we ensure that this technology is used for good? Elon had warned of the dangers of powerful AI for years. Elon and I realized that we had a shared vision of AI used to benefit humanity, thus we recruited more like minded engineers and set off to build xAI.\nThe early days of xAI were not easy. Naysayers told us that we arrived too late to the game, so starting a top AI company from scratch would be impossible. But we believed we could do the impossible. Starting a company from zero required lots of hands-on work. In the beginning I built many of the foundational tools used at the company to launch and manage training jobs. I later oversaw much of the engineering at the company, including Infrastructure, Product and Applied AI projects.\nxAI’s people are deeply dedicated. Through blood sweat and tears, our team’s blistering velocity built the Memphis supercluster, and shipped frontier models faster than any company in history. I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency. xAI executes at ludicrous speed. Industry veterans told us that building the Memphis supercluster in 120 days would be impossible.\nBut we believed we could do the impossible. Our goal was to get our training setup running at scale on the Memphis cluster ASAP. Towards the end of our 120 day deadline, we were riddled with mysterious issues with communicating over RDMA between the machines. Elon decided to fly to the datacenter, and we followed. Our infra team landed in Memphis in the middle of the night and got straight to work. After pouring through tens of thousands of lines of lspci output we finally identified a wrong BIOS setting, the root of the problem.\nElon was there with us until late into the night. When the training run finally worked, Elon posted our triumph at “4:20am” causing us to laugh out loud. I will never forget the rush of adrenaline that night, and the emotional bonds that we were all in this together. We went to bed feeling like we were living through the most exhilarating time of our lives. I have enormous love for the whole family at xAI. Our team is truly special - you’re the most dedicated people I’ve ever worked with.\nCatching up to the frontier this quickly hasn’t been easy. It was made possible by everyone’s diehard grit and team spirit. Thank you to every single person who joined me on this adventure. I want to honor your contributions, your time, your sacrifices, which are never easy. I will always remember working together far into the nights and burning the midnight oil. I will never forget the sacrifices and contributions you’ve made.\nAs I drive away today, I feel like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college. My heart is brimming with tears of joy, rooting for the company as it grows and matures. As I'm heading towards my next chapter, I’m inspired by how my parents immigrated to seek a better world for their children. Recently I had dinner with Max Tegmark , founder of the Future of Life Institute. He showed me a photo of his young sons, and asked me “how can we build AI safely to ensure that our children can flourish?” I was deeply moved by his question.\nEarlier in my career, I was a technical lead for DeepMind's Alphastar StarCraft agent, and I got to see how powerful reinforcement learning is when scaled up. As frontier models become more agentic over longer horizons and a wider range of tasks, they will take on more and more powerful capabilities, which will make it critical to study and advance AI safety. I want to continue on my mission to bring about AI that’s safe and beneficial to humanity.\nI’m announcing the launch of Babuschkin Ventures, which supports AI safety research and backs startups in AI and agentic systems that advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe. Please reach out at ventures@babuschk.in if you want to chat. The singularity is near, but humanity’s future is bright! Igor Babuschkin to start a new venture\nIn his long post on X, Babuschkin also revealed that he will not start his new venture called Babuschkin Ventures.\nThe company will support AI safety research and backs startups in AI and agentic systems that advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe. He has also invited people interested in the same cause for a chat. Second major exit from xAI\nBabuschkin’s exit comes amid a turbulent stretch for xAI. This is the second major exit from the company in a month. Recently, Robert Keele , the top lawyer at Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI also resigned from this position.\nKeele announced his decision to resign from xAI by sharing a post social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and professional networking platform LinkedIn. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough. The job was a dream, the team, incredible. Working with Elon on this tech, at this time, was the adventure of a lifetime,” wrote Keele.\nAI Masterclass for Students.

    "text": "At 80 F, the low temperature in Baton Rouge on Thursday night broke an almost century-old record — but that doesn't mean a record-breaking summer of high heat like last year's is coming, a National Weather Service meteorologist said. Before Thursday, the record high minimum temperature for Baton Rouge was set in 1920 at 76 F, the weather service said. The low temperature was unusually high on Thursday because of a \"very warm and humid air mass from the Gulf\" over the area, Danielle Manning, NWS meteorologist, said. \"The air couldn't cool off as much as it usually does during the night,\" she said. The event wasn't necessarily a predictor for the coming summer months, though, Manning said. \"Individual days don't have a lot of bearing on a season,\" she said. Last summer had \"so much higher-than-normal temperatures,\" Manning said. \"It would be very unlikely to have another summer of that kind of heat.\" Baton Rouge experienced its [hottest year on record](https://www.nola.com/news/weather/new-orleans-2024-summer-heat-prediction/article_0a925dee-0d50-11ef-9aea-abaf2ac2d36d.html) in 2023, with a yearly average of 72.6 F, compared to a longstanding yearly average of 68.1, the National Weather Service said. A strong ridge of high pressure, also described as a heat dome, developed over Louisiana in June of 2023 and didn't start breaking up until October, the weather agency said.

    "title": "Mpox: WHO reports 906 new cases from 26 countries in November",
    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 28 : There has been a global rise in mpox cases with 906 newcases recorded from 26 countries in November, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. This amounts to an increase of 26 per cent compared to cases in October, the WHO said in its latest monthly update. Most cases in November were reported from the Americas (34 per cent) and from the European Region (29 per cent). In the Americas, the US reported the highest with nearly 300 cases. In Europe, Portugal reported 128 new cases. In the Asia region, cases increased in Singapore, while China's cases declined. Africa reported a small decline, but the WHO said irregular reporting and high numbers of suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) outbreak make it difficult to interpret the trend there. \"The constantly changing geographical distribution of the cases does not allow for an accurate prediction of the regional trends, but the continued high number of cases globally highlights the fact that this outbreak is not over, and the virus continues to find pockets of susceptible individuals,\" the WHO said. The group did not note any major changes in the epidemiology of the disease. Between January 1, 2022 and November 30, 2023, a total of 92,783 laboratory-confirmed cases of mpox, including 171 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 116 countries. In the global of all reported modes of transmission outbreak, sexual encounter is the most common, comprising 17,907 of 21,561 (83.1 per cent) of all reported transmission events, followed by person-to-person non-sexual contact. This pattern has persisted over the last six months, with 97.1 per cent of new cases reporting sexual contact, the WHO said. The most common symptom is any rash, reported in 89.9 per cent of cases, followed by fever (58.4 per cent), and systemic rash or genital rash (54.3 per cent and 50.2 per cent, respectively).",
