    "title": "Undercover Mountie questioned on whether she misinterpreted Coutts border protest",
    "text": "Anti-mandate demonstrators gather as a truck convoy blocks the highway at the busy U.S. border crossing in Coutts, Alta., Monday, Jan. 31, 2022. An undercover police officer is set to face more cross-examination today at the murder-conspiracy trial of two protesters at the border blockade at Coutts, Alta. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh LETHBRIDGE, Alta. — An undercover Mountie who infiltrated the Coutts border blockade faced questions in court Thursday on her police work and on whether she misinterpreted what was really going on. The officer, who can’t be identified, was under cross-examination by the lawyer for one of two men accused of conspiring to murder police at the blockade in 2022. Anthony (Tony) Olienick and Chris Carbert are on trial in Court of King’s Bench on charges surrounding the blockade, which snarled traffic at the Canada-U.S. border at Coutts, Alta., for two weeks to protest COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates. The officer, identified in court only as HQ1298, posed as a volunteer at the blockade. She has testified that Olienick confided in her he expected to die in the standoff and planned to slit the throats of police. She said Olienick also referred to police as the “devil’s arms” which he explained was a way of saying police were doing the bidding of the “devil” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Defence lawyer Katherin Beyak suggested to the officer that the focus of the protest -- and most of the supporters -- was anger at government and not the RCMP. &quot;What I&#039;m going to suggest to you is the frustration that was being expressed, not only by Tony, but also by other people ... was at the government as opposed to the RCMP. Would you agree with that?&quot; Beyak asked. &quot;No,” the officer replied. “Not with Tony. “The only person that talks about the police or the RCMP excessively is Tony. “My conversations with Mr. Olienick are very much focused on the existence of a war. Nobody else talks about an existence of a war taking place with ... the RCMP.&quot; Beyak is the lawyer for Carbert, but the Crown testimony to date has focused on the actions and words of Olienick. HQ1298 has testified to her conversations and subsequent notes she made on conversations with Olienick. Beyak suggested the notes lacked critical context given they referred only to what Olienick said and not to what HQ1298 said. &quot;If it was something significant I had said, I obviously would have documented it,” the officer replied. “Lots of times, we&#039;re just listening and we&#039;re taking it in. &quot;There would be lots of times there would just be Tony speaking and me paring down the information to what&#039;s very significant like his political ideologies that really aren&#039;t offence-related. “My goal is to see what the truth is. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot; Olienick and Carbert were arrested after Mounties found a cache of guns, body armour and ammunition in trailers in the area. The two are also charged with mischief and possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose. Olienick faces a further charge of being in possession of a pipe bomb.

    "text": "Derrick Henry gave Tennessee Titans fans some great memories over his eight seasons with the team. The city of Nashville seems to have given Henry plenty of great memories too. Henry will be a free agent after this season, and he's unlikely to return to the Titans. He has acknowledged that probability often late this season. After the Titans won 28-20 over the Jacksonville Jaguars in their final game, Henry took a microphone and thanked Titans fans. It's fairly rare for a player to address the crowd after a game, but Henry is a rare player. Henry had 153 yards and a touchdown in what was almost assuredly his final game with the Titans. In a heartfelt message, Henry thanked Titans fans for \"the greatest eight years of my life,\" and said he appreciated them supporting him through the ups and the downs. There were a lot more ups than downs, including a 2,000-yard rushing season in 2020, one of his two NFL rushing titles. \"Hopefully I was an inspiration to all the young kids,\" Henry said. Henry represented the Titans well from when he was a second-round pick, following his Heisman Trophy season at Alabama, until his final game. Henry just turned 30 and is nearing the end of his career. He can help his next team on a short-term deal starting next season. Whatever happens, he'll be welcomed back in Tennessee. It seems the feeling is mutual.",

    "title": "Trump minacciato di morte: ricercato un uomo/ In North Carolina comizio blindato con vetro anti-proiettile",
    "text": "Un altro comizio thriller per Donald Trump, che [dopo quanto accaduto più di un mese fa in Pennsylvania](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/attentato-donald-trump-thomas-crooks-non-ha-agito-da-solo-spunta-un-nuovo-dubbio/2743769/), è stato nuovamente al centro di minacce. A poche ore da un nuovo incontro con gli elettori, questa volta in Arizona e più precisamente a Phoenix, l’ex presidente degli Stati Uniti è stato minacciato nuovamente, questa volta sui social. Come spiegato dai media americani, lo sceriffo della contea di Cochice ha dato la caccia ad un uomo considerato intenzionato ad uccidere proprio il politico, secondo gli inquirenti. Il ricercato si chiama Ronald Lee Syrvud ed è, secondo i militari, una minaccia per la vita dell’ex presidente, poiché più volte sui social si è schierato contro il tycoon. Ronald Lee Syrvud, sui propri canali social personali, ha più volte minacciato Donald Trump pubblicando una serie di post contro il repubblicano. Il 66enne, come spiegano dagli Stati Uniti, è già ricercato in Wisconsin e in Arizona per una serie di reati. Donald Trump, comizio blindato in North Carolina Dopo l’attentato subito il mese scorso in Pennsylvania, a Butler, quando un giovane ha sparato una serie di proiettili contro Donald Trump ferendolo però solamente ad un orecchio, l’attenzione è alta nei confronti dell’ex presidente. Se in Arizona, a Phoenix, la polizia si è messa alla ricerca di un uomo che aveva più volte minacciato il tycoon sui social, con alcuni post pubblicati, nel North Carolina hanno fatto qualcosa di simile, tanto per sottolineare che ormai l’attenzione non è mai troppa. Ad Asheboro, infatti, Donald Trump ha tenuto un comizio all’aperto protetto da alcuni pannelli trasparenti antiproiettile. Nello Stato, uno di quelli in bilico tra repubblicani e democratici, intorno al palco sono stati montati dei vetri simili a quelli che ha la limousine utilizzata dall’ex presidente americano, pensata proprio per proteggere la sua vita da malintenzionati. Quello in North Carolina è stato il primo comizio di Donald Trump all’aperto dopo [quanto accaduto a Butler il 13 luglio scorso](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/attentato-trump-come-un-agente-e-un-cecchino-lo-hanno-salvato-le-indagini-crooks-si-e-preparato-a-lungo/2742336/): il Secret Service aveva infatti sconsigliato al candidato di tenere comizi all’aperto, ma il tycoon aveva replicato spiegando che non avrebbe smesso di incontrare gli elettori, accettando però un rafforzamento delle misure di protezione.",
