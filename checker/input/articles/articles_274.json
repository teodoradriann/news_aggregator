    "text": "Religion : Sacked CBC Members File Umpteenth Case Against Church\nBy Kimeng Hilton- 16 févr. 2025 13:21\n0 Likes\nThe matter, the only criminal suit out of the 10 so far brought against the Cameroon Baptist Convention and its officials, opened in a Yaounde court on February 13, 2025.\nWithin the span of less than a year, some dismissed members of the Cameroon Baptist Convention, CBC, have filed a barrage of 10 legal actions against the church and its officials. Challenging the 2023 amended CBC Constitution and the General Session or decentralized elections for CBC national leaders that held on November 23, 2024. While 9 of the cases have been civil in nature, the latest is criminal. It was filed before the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif.\nTwo Litigants\nThe litigants this time are Mr. Emi Emmanuel from Bamenda and Mr. Albert Luma from Buea. Chief Jacob Taku who is plaintiff in the other matters is not involved in the latest suit. The two are challenging the holding of CBC elections on November 23, 2024, allegedly in violation of a November 21, 2024 ruling by the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif. The order temporarily suspended the holding of the vote in Yaounde until the plaintiffs’ challenge of the amended CBC Constitution of 2023 had been settled definitely.\nThree Accused\nJoined in the new matter are Rev. Dr. Nditemeh Charlemagne, the immediate past CBC Executive President who handed over to Rev. Dr. Teke John in early January 2025. Mr. Yosimbom Mkong John, the immediate past CBC Chairperson. And Rinda Kawep Jumbuin, the 15-year-old son of Rev. Jumbuin Enoch, Pastor of the Yaounde Field Conference of CBC Churches - according to the motion filed by counsel for the litigants. The matter opened in the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif on Thursday, February 13, 2025. But was not opened to the public as it was the preliminary phase for counsel for the accused (the CBC) to acquaint themselves with the details of the suit.\nFor Allegedly Violating Court Order\nOne of the counsel for the litigants, Maître Fernand Honoré Tagouemekong, spoke to Cameroon Tribune on phone. He said they filed the matter of urgent application because the CBC violated the ruling in November 2024 by the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif suspending the holding of the CBC decentralized General Session elections. Until definite verdicts had been made in the previous matters challenging the CBC amended Constitution of 2023.\nPossible Two-year Imprisonment, Fine\n“But the order of the judge of urgent application was violated by the CBC by going ahead with the elections. This is why our clients filed criminal proceedings, seeking the sentence of the three CBC defendants for at least two years’ imprisonment; and the payment of damage,” Maître Tagouemekong noted.\nAccelerated Private Prosecution\nAlso speaking to Cameroon Tribune on phone, Barrister Sonkwa Victorine, lead counsel for the Cameroon Baptist Convention in the matter, said the action was commenced by way of private prosecution. Meaning neither the police nor the gendarmes investigated the matter; but it is provided for by Cameroon’s Criminal Code.\nFebruary 27, 2025 For Next Hearing\nBarrister Sonkwa explained that for such a matter to be heard, the President of the Court fixes a deposit that must be paid by the litigant and a date scheduled for hearing. If on the day of hearing the litigant has not paid the deposit, the matter will be thrown out. If paid, the matter can continue. In the criminal matter against the CBC former officials and a CBC Christian, the Yaounde Court of First Instance Centre Administratif fixed the deposit at 40,000 FCFA. And the date for the next hearing for February 27, 2025.\nMinor As One Of The Accused\n“Do the complainants have the locus standi to sue Rev. Dr. Nditemeh and Mr. Yosimbom, over the CBC Constitution, given that they are no longer members of the CBC? The answer is no!” Barrister Victorine said. “Moreover, the third person joined in the suit is a 15-year-old boy, a minor, who does not have criminal responsibility! …. We respected the ruling of the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif that elections be suspended in Yaounde. No elections held in Yaounde and so we don’t know what they are contesting. They are only making noise to stay on top and be relevant,” Barrister Sonkwa said.\nThe Last Matter Last Year\nIn the afternoon of Thursday, November 21, 2024m, the President of the Yaounde Court of First Instance Centre Administratif, Justice Theophile Georges Ntimba, read out his brief verdict. Dismissing the CBC’s arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, which should be rather handled by an administrative court.\nBut the judge granted the prayer of the three former Cameroon Baptist Convention, CBC members that decentralised CBC nationwide elections scheduled for Saturday, November 23, 2024 be temporarily suspended in Yaounde voting centre. While they are allowed to go ahead as scheduled in the other 11 voting centres across the country. Justice Ntimba said his ruling was given pending judgement in the matter between ex-CBC members and the CBC currently before the Mezam High Court in Bamenda, North West Region. Justice Ntimba gave the defendants 15 days to appeal the judgement.\nMeanwhile, ruling in the substantive matter between the three CBC ex-members and CBC leadership before the Mezam High Court was earlier scheduled for November 19, 2024. Then adjourned to Thursday, November 21, 2024. Before a further adjournment to Friday, November 22, 2024. Just a day before CBC elections on November 23, 2024. Followed by indefinite adjournments.\nIn the matter of accelerated action brought by three former CBC members, Albert Luma, Emi Emmanuel and Chief Jacob Taku, through their counsel, had prayed the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif to suspend the holding in Yaounde of CBC decentralised nationwide elections for national leaders on November 23, 2024.\n&ldquo...\nThis article is for subscribers only\nAlready subscribed?\nIdentify yourself >\nUnlimited access to Cameroon Tribune Digital from 26,250 FCFA\nI subscribe\n1 minute is enough to subscribe to Cameroon Tribune Digital!\n- Your special cameroon-tribune issue in digital version\n- Inserts\n- Exclusive calls for tenders\n- Preview (access 24 hours before publication)\n- Editions available on all media (smartphone, tablets, PC)",

    "text": "Former Warriors winger, Kuda Mahachi, embarks on a new chapter with Manica Diamonds, aiming for tranquility post-acquittal. The talented midfielder's career was marred by grave allegations, impacting both his professional path and personal life. Now, with a two-year deal secured, Mahachi seeks to reclaim his peace of mind and love for football in Mutare.\nFrom Trial to Triumph\nMahachi's journey has been anything but ordinary. Accusations of child abuse and attempted murder against his son cast a long shadow over his career, culminating in a court trial that ended in his acquittal last November. The ordeal not only strained his professional ties, leading to the non-renewal of his contract with SuperSport United but also inflicted personal losses, including financial strain and vandalism of his property. Despite these hurdles, Mahachi's resilience shines through, finding solace in the opportunity presented by Manica Diamonds to return to the sport he loves away from the turmoil of his past.\nA New Beginning in Mutare\nChoosing Manica Diamonds was more than a career decision for Mahachi; it was a step towards healing. Distancing himself from Bulawayo, where the drama unfolded, he viewed the move to Mutare as a chance to start afresh. Reuniting with coach Jairos Tapera, whom he respects deeply, also played a crucial role in his decision. Tapera's mentorship from Mahachi's early days in the junior national teams has been instrumental in his development as a player. With Manica Diamonds' impressive performance in the Premier Soccer League last season, Mahachi is optimistic about contributing to the team's success and achieving peace of mind.\nLooking Forward\nThe road to redemption for Mahachi involves more than just proving his worth on the pitch; it's about rebuilding his life and reputation. His story serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges athletes can face off the field and the strength required to overcome them. As Mahachi gears up for an exciting season with Manica Diamonds, fans and supporters are keen to see the impact he will make, not just as a player but as a symbol of resilience and determination. His journey resonates with many, offering hope that even in the face of adversity, it's possible to find a way back to one's passion and peace.",

(KGUN) — During a monsoon storm on July 14 a tree fell and brought the breaker box off a house down with it, and for more than two weeks following, the house’s residents were without electricity.\nThe storm hit the Northside neighborhood, near Flowing Wells and River hard on July 14, which was the day Claire Wilson planned to move into her new house.\n“We were left without power pretty unexpectedly right when we really needed it,” Wilson said.\nShe says she then spent more than two weeks following the storm trying to get the power back on in the home she is renting.\n“We have been on the phone with TEP, the city, our landlords and the landlords' electricians to try to fix the issue and we just keep running into roadblocks,” she said.\nJoe Barrios, TEP Spokesperson, says if equipment on the customer's side of a meter is damaged, those repairs need to be done first.\n“The safest thing to do is for us to not restore service to a specific meter so that the customer can complete whatever repairs to their home or their business or whatever the case might be before we restore service,” Barrios said.\nWilson says the new breaker box was installed last week by an electrician, but Barrios says they have to wait until they are notified that work is inspected by the local jurisdiction.\nBarrios said, “Once we can verify that their equipment is correctly installed and adheres to all of our standards then we’ll be more than happy to come out as quickly as we can to take a look at the work, make sure it’s all done correctly and then we’ll be happy to restore service to them.”\nHowever, Wilson says it all took too long. She said, “People who are left without power are usually already dealing with an emergency situation and them delaying getting the power back on creates a second emergency for people that they don't deserve to have to deal with.”\nPower was restored Thursday morning at Wilson's home and she says it is such a relief to feel comfortable in her space.\n——\nMadison Thomas joined KGUN 9 in July of 2023 as a multimedia journalist .

La acción de tutela refleja la tensión entre la necesidad de garantizar una gestión administrativa eficiente y la protección de los derechos laborales y del acceso a servicios públicos esenciales como la salud.\nLa tutela sigue en trámite, y el se espera el fallo definitivo que podría sentar un precedente importante en la relación entre estabilidad laboral y eficiencia estatal.",

    "text": "A leaking fuel tanker that exploded earlier this week as people gathered to collect the petrol has left more than 40 people dead.\nThe blast on Tuesday also injured at least 83 people in the town of Totota in the central part of the West African country, health officials said on Thursday.\nMany of the dead were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday because their remains were unrecognisable, said health official Dr. Cynthia Blapook in Bong County.\nAuthorities said an exact death toll was difficult to confirm because of how badly the bodies were burned.\nLiberian Vice President Jewel Howard-Taylor attended the mass funeral.\n\"We never expected to start the new year like this,\" Howard-Taylor said.\nHealth officials said the number of injured could rise as they were not certain everyone had been brought in for care.\nA doctor at one hospital treating the injured urged the Liberian government to deploy a disaster management team and to have one in each county to respond to emergencies.\nDr. Minnie Sankawolo-Rocks also pleaded with people not to approach fuel tankers in the hope of collecting much-needed petrol. Similar deadly accidents have occurred elsewhere in Africa.\n\"Please, I am begging you,\" she said.\nSankawolo-Rocks said people did not listen to police instructions to keep away before the tanker exploded.\n ",

    "text": "Elecciones 2024 Obispos oran para que Dios guíe proceso electoral y fortalezca compromiso por la paz Obispos del país ofrecieron una oración para que Dios guie el proceso electoral del próximo 2 de junio y fortalezca el compromiso por la paz Durante este tiempo de Cuaresma, obispos del país ofrecieron una oración para que Dios guie el proceso electoral del próximo 2 de junio y fortalezca el compromiso por la paz. En un videomensaje con motivo de la Semana Santa “Triduo Pascual 2024”, los integrantes de la Conferencia del Episcopado Mexicano (CEM) destacaron que el pueblo ha demostrado su profunda fe a través del ayuno, la oración, los sacrificios y las ofrendas. “Unamos estas prácticas a la vida contemplativa de la iglesia y ofrezcámoslas especialmente por nuestra oración para que Dios guie el proceso electoral y fortalezca nuestro compromiso por la paz”, señaló monseñor Ramón Castro. El obispo de San Luis Potosí, Jorge Alberto Cavazos, señaló que en este año dedicado a la oración rumbo al gran Jubileo de 2025, los católicos están invitados a intensificar el diálogo con Dios, como lo recuerda el Papa Francisco, de que “es el aliento de la fe, es su expresión más propia como un grito que sale del corazón de quien cree y confía en Dios”. Por su parte, el obispo de Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí, Roberto Yenni García, pidió vivir este tiempo de gracia en un espíritu de sinodalidad, caminando juntos como iglesia, “escuchándonos mutuamente y buscando la voluntad de Dios”. Saludó también a los hermanos del pueblo judío que celebra la Pascua conmemorando la liberación del pueblo de la alianza. “Asimismo, nos unimos a todas las comunidades eclesiales que profesan la fe en la resurrección de Jesucristo”. Mientras que el obispo Francisco Javier Acero invitó a las demás tradiciones religiosas a encender una luz de paz para unirnos como seres humanos en la construcción de un mundo más fraterno, como una obra artesanal que quiere de esfuerzo y compromiso de todos.
