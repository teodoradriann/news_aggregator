    "title": "John John Florence’s Long Road to a Third World Title",
    "text": "“It will be really fun in the next few years to push the level of surfing. I just want to get better. I want to be the guy that you go into a heat with and he feels unstoppable.” That was John John Florence , straight after he’d won his second world title at Pipe in 2017. He was the first surfer to go back-to-back since Kelly Slater in 2012. He’d doused a raging comeback from Gabriel Medina. He was 25. The claim to soon be unstoppable was justified. His road to a third world title looked straightforward: smooth tarmac, no sharp corners, an airport runway to a sustained period of world surfing domination. However, early in the journey, the first minor speed bumps appeared. In May of the next year, he suffered a tear to his right ACL that ruled him out of the back half of 2018. The three-peat was out. In 2019 he returned to the tour at full fitness and looked back to his 2017 peak. Then came another ACL injury, this time in Rio. A world title tilt was replaced by surgery and six months of rehab. Almost miraculously, he was back in the water for Pipeline and qualified for the Tokyo Olympics. Then COVID came, taking out everyone’s chance of a world title in 2020. In 2021, the WSL Finals came in and a top-five spot became Florence’s primary goal. He was well on track until he did his ACL again mid-heat at Margaret River. Such was his injury record it was considered positive news that this time the damage was done on his other “good knee.” Again, Florence set about fixing himself for the start of the next season. In 2022 he was ranked third when he tore his MCL at the G-Land Pro. It was the fourth consecutive season he’d had his campaign stopped in its tracks around the halfway stage. The year 2023, however, was a turning point. He had restructured his training, focusing on movement and injury prevention. “I think it’s made me a better surfer in a weird way, I think a smarter surfer,” Florence said on his injury and time away from the Championship Tour at the start of the season. “I feel like I’m more patient on the wave, and I feel like I’m stronger because I’m training more.” The stats back his instincts. Since the start of that CT season, the Hawaiian hasn’t missed an event. The Corona Pro in Fiji was his 19th in a row, his longest unbroken sequence since he claimed the world title in 2017. The only event he missed was last year’s WSL Finals when he finished the rankings at number eight. Disappointing perhaps, but you sensed that was a fair trade for an injury-free year and a better platform for a crack in 2024. This year, the road has finally smoothed out. Potential curveballs of the Olympics and the birth of his first child were navigated relatively serenely. The speed bumps, hair pins, potholes and diversions over the last six years seemed to have been graded flat and mapped evenly. This year he has made four finals, won one, and Bells was his only early round loss. In 2017 he won the world title without claiming an event victory, consistency being the bedrock of his charge. If it were back in 2017, John John would have already claimed the world title. His 3,000-rating point lead would have been enough to have him out of sight. If I’m to stretch this road analogy beyond breaking point (if it isn’t already), it might be a good time to bring in Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalypse masterpiece The Road. With John being a literary type, he’ll know the main character advises to, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.” Florence has done that. He’s never wavered from his goal of another world title. Never thought about not coming back from yet another shredded ligament, a fracture of a bone or a muscle strained beyond its capacity. The WSL Finals have now added a final stretch of tarmac to his long road to redemption. He has to win two heats to nab a third championship. If he does, he can still claim to be unstoppable.",

    "text": "Photo: Mario Tama / Getty Images News / Getty Images\nA storm off the coast of California is creating massive waves that are flooding coastal areas across the state. Officials ordered people living in coastal cities in Marin and Santa Cruz counties to evacuate on Thursday (December 28) as the waves battered the coast.\nWhile many people are flocking to the beach to see the waves, which could top 40 feet, officials are urging them to stay away.\n\"The High Surf Warning is in effect through 3 am Friday. Breaking waves of 28-33 ft are possible at the coast. Please use extreme caution and stay far from the water. NEVER turn your back on the ocean, stay off jetties, rocks, or piers, and do not go into the water!\" the National Weather Service in the Bay Area wrote on X .\nThe storm is forecast to make landfall on Friday (December 29), and could dump up to three inches of rain in some areas.\n\"A Pacific storm system will approach the West Coast Friday morning, bringing increasing precipitation chances to California and the Pacific Northwest. Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is likely for much of California Friday, focusing along the northern and central coast and along the higher terrain of the coastal ranges. Snow levels will start rather high as a plume of warm, moist air moves in from the Pacific, keeping snowfall limited to higher mountain peaks. Areal average rainfall totals of 1-3\" may lead to some isolated flooding concerns,\" the National Weather Service said .\nVideo captured a rogue wave in Ventura , sending beachgoers running in terror as they tried to avoid getting swept up in the massive wall of water. Officials said that at least eight people were hospitalized.",

Il sera donc possible de l'observer à l'œil nu. MétéoNews invite les amateurs à regarder le ciel vendredi soir, puisque samedi il devrait être bouché. Vincent Devantay, météorologue, indique qu’il faut se tourner « en direction de l’ouest dès que le soleil sera couché. Même s’il ne fait pas encore nuit noire, on pourrait apercevoir cette comète. » Ce corps céleste proche de l'horizon sera même plus brillant que les étoiles environnantes. La dernière comète visible à l’œil nu, c’était en 1999. D’ailleurs Tsuchinshan, qui se trouve à 70 millions de kilomètres entre la Terre et le Soleil, sera de retour dans 80'000 ans. Dès le milieu de semaine, elle devrait être de moins en moins visible puisqu’elle va s’éloigner progressivement de la Terre. Corps de glace et de poussières ll s’agit d’un corps constitué de glace et de poussières. Les comètes ont des orbites très excentrées et restent la plupart du temps très éloignées de la Terre et du Soleil. Quand une d'entre elles se rapproche, elle subit l’action du soleil et s’entoure d’un halo appelé chevelure. Elle se prolonge également par une queue de poussières et de gaz ionisé qui lui donne une forme très caractéristique. /ATS-ncp",

    "text": "Barrett & House GOP would risk health coverage for 63,000 people in Michigan’s 7th District With inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Tom Barrett and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations. House Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.” Last week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid. Despite campaigning on making life more affordable for Michiganders, Barrett is poised to do just the opposite. DCCC Spokesperson Viet Shelton: “Tom Barrett knows exactly what he is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.” ###",

It puts pressure on the new Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio to find ways to stop Green Bay's offense when the two teams face off Friday night in Brazil.\nJacobs led the league in rushing two seasons ago but suffered injuries in 2023. He's been the catalyst for the Las Vegas Raiders offense for the last five seasons.\nPhiladelphia will already have to contend with the likes of Jordan Love and the Packers passing offense, but Jacobs is an entirely different threat on his own.\nRelated: Eagles vs. Packers: How To Watch Week 1 Showdown in Brazil\nEarly in 2023, the Eagles were one of the better-rushing teams in the NFL before their untimely collapse down the stretch.

    "text": "A Victorian agtech company was launched with a goal in mind - to get farmers home safely at the end of the working day. AirAgri provides an Australian designed, built and owned farm safety software tool, developed to reduce the inherent risks of farming. It was developed by Victorian brothers and farmers James and Paul Diamond, who come from a Merino and Angus operation in Mansfield. \"About five years ago, we started building different tools to solve our own problems,\" James said. AirAgri's safety tracking and alert solution provides a series of automated safety notifications using proprietary rules, location, emergency and medical information, along with access to inventory and safe handling working documents to act like a digital filing cabinet on a farmer's phone. Their solution is made up a series of independent components, designed to work where typical phones do not. Leveraging direct to satellite and ground IoT networks the team at AirAgri have devised a solution that not only works in the bush but is easy to use. \"It makes a perfect safety device because it works across a lot of rural locations where phones don't work,\" James said. \"We've got customers in the middle of the Kimberley where coverage is non existent. No matter where a farmer is, our solution can give them peace of mind.\" The business also provides property-specific weather forecasting enabling farmers to access accurate forecasts for their individual rural assets, rather than relying on broader, district forecasts. Within AirAgri, 100 per cent of the data is stored and sovereign in Australia and is owned by the individual, who at any time can delete their data. The farmer can download their own digital map of their properties and export it in a global format into a competing platform or another format for later use, or in turn, AirAgri can import data from other platforms. James said farmers with any tech skill level could use the AirAgri system, with a team on hand to help if extra guidance is needed with either setting up or usage. \"We're trying to ensure adopting agtech is not a hurdle for farmers,\" he said. \"The whole idea is that you don't need to worry about things like how to connect to IoT, as it's a fully managed service. The farmer can just focus on farming.\" AirAgri provides a free base service for digital property maps, individual and livestock record keeping, a second-tier service (tasks, paddocks and livestock) for the price of a cup of coffee and a premium service of proprietary farm safety capability. The brothers' commitment to protecting farming families and their assets was recognised by Worksafe Victoria at the coveted 2023 Worksafe Awards in Melbourne in February. AirAgri was named as the winner of the Commitment to Workplace Health and Safety on a Farm category. \"For is, it's all about bringing farmers home safely at the end of the day,\" James said. AirAgri was one of 20 emerging agtech start-ups to benefit from a $50,000 grant under the Victorian Government's $1 million AgTech Grants Program. The business was also supported by the Victorian Government's $15 million AgTech Regional Innovation Network (AgRIN) to complete the \"Rocket Seeder\" and the Farmers2Founders pre-accelerator programs helping them refine their idea and develop their business skills. James presented at AgSmart Connect 2024, Australia's leading regional agri-tech event, in Tamworth in March. AirAgri will also be exhibiting at Beef Australia 2024 at Rockhampton in May, Elders FarmFest 2024 on June 4-6 and AgQuip, Gunnedah, on August 20-22. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "Dinâmica de resultados melhores, apesar do sentimento deteriorado Nós esperamos uma temporada de resultados positiva para os varejistas, com dinâmicas de resultados melhorando, embora ofuscada por um sentimento deteriorado no setor por preocupações relacionadas ao cenário macroeconômico. No setor de consumo discricionário, devemos ver tendências sólidas de receita, com expansão de margens na maioria das companhias, já que o consumo melhorou e as iniciativas internas das companhias estão dando resultados. Em e-commerce, as margens devem continuar melhorando, apesar da demanda ainda fraca, enquanto as vendas mesmas lojas (SSS) dos varejistas alimentares devem continuar sendo impactadas por tendências desfavoráveis de inflação alimentar e ambiente mais competitivo, embora o GMAT deva ser um destaque. Por fim, as farmácias devem apresentar resultados sólidos, com SSS acima da inflação e níveis de rentabilidade melhores. No geral, vemos GMAT, CEAB, SMFT e NTCO como os destaques desta temporada. Um trimestre de diferentes histórias. Nós esperamos que os varejistas reportem uma temporada do 3T no geral melhor, com receita se recuperando e expansão de margens na maioria das companhias. No entanto, hoje o posicionamento no setor é leve (veja nossa última pesquisa [aqui](https://conteudos.xpi.com.br/acoes/relatorios/varejo-xp-pesquisa-de-posicionamento-outubro-de-2024/)) devido a preocupações relacionadas ao cenário macroeconômico, enquanto as expectativas estão concentradas em poucos nomes (VIVA/LREN como os destaques positivos e ASAI/CRFB como os destaques negativos), possivelmente pelas tendências mistas nos outros players. Tendências sólidas em consumo discricionário. Esperamos que os varejistas de baixa/média renda reportem um crescimento acelerado da receita, mais uma vez apoiado por volumes, margens melhores e níveis controlados de inadimplência. Quanto aos players de alta renda, VIVA deve ser o destaque, com crescimento acelerado da receita e expansão da margem EBITDA ajustada, enquanto AZZA deve apresentar tendências de receita melhores, mas com margens ainda pressionadas pelos custos de integração, como esperado. Sem grandes mudanças no cenário desafiante do varejo alimentar. Para o varejo alimentar, esperamos que as dinâmicas de receita continuem pressionadas por tendências desfavoráveis de inflação alimentar, concorrência e poder de compra limitado, embora o GMAT deva ser um destaque, apoiado pela expansão da companhia (+22 novas lojas no último ano) e um desempenho sólido na sua campanha de aniversário. Quanto às margens, a implementação de serviços deve ser um problema para ASAI/CRFB, mas a ASAI deve conseguir mitigar esse efeito, enquanto o GMAT deve entregar expansão de margens brutas e EBITDA. Mais do mesmo em farmácias. Em relação às farmácias, esperamos que as vendas mesmas lojas maduras permaneçam acima da inflação e que os níveis de rentabilidade melhorem, enquanto a PNVL deve ser o destaque entre os players, já que os ventos contrários das enchentes parecem ter ficado no passado. Cenário semelhante ao do 2T para e-commerce. As dinâmicas de receita devem continuar enfrentando demanda fraca pelas taxas de juros altas, embora esperamos que o crescimento e a rentabilidade melhorem sequencialmente, com a MGLU como destaque.

    "text": "After the IAEA report revealed an increase in Iran's enriched uranium production, the governments of the United States, France, Germany and Britain issued a joint statement Thursday evening condemning the disturbing trend. \"The report emphasizes that Iran has increased the rate of production of enriched uranium up to 60% at Natanz and Fordow compared to levels observed between January and June 2023. These findings reflect a step back on Iran's part,\" the statement said. \"This would triple the monthly production rate of enriched uranium to 60%.\"\n\"We condemn this action, which adds to the unabated escalation of Iran's nuclear program. Iran's production of highly enriched uranium has no credible civilian justification, and the reported production at the Fordow fuel enrichment plant and fuel enrichment plant carries significant risks related to distribution. We are also paying attention to Iran's decision to return to the same Cascade configuration as the one discovered by the IAEA at Fordow earlier this year.\nGalant hints that Israel attacked Iran: \"We were attacked from 7 arenas, we have already operated in 6 of them\" // Elad Malka Iran's delay in announcing this change in January 2023 has raised serious doubts about Iran's willingness to cooperate with the IAEA in full transparency. These resolutions demonstrate Iran's lack of goodwill to de-escalate and represent reckless behavior in a tense regional context.\n\"We call on Iran to immediately reverse these steps and de-escalate its nuclear program. Iran must cooperate fully with the IAEA to allow it to provide assurances that its nuclear program is only peaceful, and reappoint the inspectors who were suspended in September 2023.\"\n\"We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and reaffirm our determination that Iran must never develop nuclear weapons,\" the statement added.\nThe Natanz nuclear facility, archive, photo: E. P\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Tuesday that Iran had increased back the pace of uranium enrichment at the two nuclear facilities.\nReuters reports that the rate of uranium enrichment now stands at up to 60%, close to the level of weapons, and Iran has returned to a rate of about 9 kg per month from the reduced rate of 3 kg. \"The Atomic Energy Intelligence Agency has confirmed that Iran has increased production of UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) enriched by up to 60% U-235 to about 9 kg per month since the end of November in these two facilities combined.\" The UN nuclear watchman said in a statement, referring to the Fordow nuclear enrichment facility, and the Natanz site.\nWrong?
