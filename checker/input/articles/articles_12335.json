    "title": "Football. Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool",
    "text": "Football Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool Liverpool reste sur le trône de la Premier League après la contre-performance de son désormais dauphin, Arsenal, battu à l'Emirates Stadium par West Ham (2-0) jeudi en conclusion d’une 19e journée qui aura vu perdre trois des cinq équipes de tête. Cinq jours après avoir accroché les Reds à Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal a contre toute attente cédé face à l'équipe qui l'avait éliminée de la Coupe de la Ligue début novembre. Les Hammers ont donné raison à l'analyse de leur entraîneur David Moyes, qui assurait avant le match que cette année était la meilleure de l'histoire du club, avec notamment un triomphe en Ligue Europa Conférence. Ils n'ont pas concédé la moindre occasion dans la première demi-heure de jeu, et même marqué peu avant le quart d'heure après une mauvaise appréciation de Gabriel Magalhaes, qui a profité à Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13e). L'ancien défenseur Lillois a également perdu un duel aérien décisif en seconde période face à Konstantinos Mavropanos, suite à un corner de Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55e). Un manque de réalisme côté Gunners Souvent efficaces face au but depuis le début de la saison, les Gunners ont cette fois manqué de réalisme avec Saka (30e, 42e), Martinelli (37e), Gabriel Jesus (66e) puis Trossard dans le dernier quart d'heure. Le score aurait pu être plus cruel si Benrahma avait transformé son penalty dans le temps additionnel. Les rentrées en jeu successives de Nketiah, Nelson et Smith Rowe ont rappelé le manque de profondeur de banc à disposition de Mikel Arteta. Arsenal compte deux points de retard sur Liverpool, alors que West Ham, 6e, est à l'affut des places européennes, à trois points de Tottenham et quatre points de Manchester City, vainqueur mardi à Everton (3-1) et qui compte un match de plus à disputer. Tottenham rechute lourdement Peu avant, Tottenham avait sévèrement rechuté sur le terrain de Brighton (4-2) et raté l'occasion de se rapprocher de la tête du championnat. Tottenham était pourtant la meilleure équipe à l'extérieur avant cette rencontre et finit la première moitié de saison sur une note négative, malgré une bonne cinquième place au classement, à un point de Manchester City. Meilleurs ces dernières semaines après un mois de novembre catastrophique sur le plan des résultats, les Spurs ont montré un visage inhabituel avec beaucoup de passivité, comme sur cette action individuelle de Joao Pedro qui a pu passer en revue quatre joueurs et donner une balle en or à Jack Hinshelwood, démarqué à l'entrée de la surface de réparation (1-0, 11e). Entre plusieurs occasions nettes pour Brighton (17e, 32e, 45e), le même Joao Pedro allait ensuite transformer deux pénalties (23e, 75e), avec entre-temps une frappe puissante de Pervis Estupinan dans la lucarne opposée de Vicario (63e). Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e) ont réduit le score, trop tard pour faire douter les Seagulls. Brighton se repositionne à la huitième place, à six points de la première place européenne.",

In that role she is responsible for ensuring that Disney continues to invest in the intersection between online tech and content distribution.\nDoes that invalidate his point regarding enshittification?\nI think it might matter if Cory came out and said, I am starting an org with the resources to fix it. But I don’t see how this tidbit is relevant for a guy who coined the term about what’s happening here and has been beating the drum about the problem.\nYeah this feels like a “no true Scot” fallacy to me, where anything he says should be invalid because of his wife’s position, which is false\nSee Kelly Ann Conway and George Conway.\nI like Doctorow, and these point are valid. I just don’t see the American government doing anything to benefit the people, regardless of left or right orientation. Most Americans want abortion access and reasonable restrictions on gun sales; I can’t imagine any candidates, local or federal doing little more than making empty promises on these subjects. Even Obama care is a hugely compromised husk of reasonable healthcare for all, and you still have republicans clamoring to dismantle it.\nI hate to be pessimistic, but I don’t think any American politician would take on this topic.\nI don’t think any American politician would take on this topic.\nThat’s the feature\nAnother way to encourage interoperability is to use the government to hold out a carrot in addition to the stick. Through government procurement laws, governments could require any company providing a product or service to the government to not interfere with interoperability. President Lincoln required standard tooling for bullets and rifles during the Civil War, so there’s a long history of requiring this already. If companies don’t want to play nice, they’ll lose out on some lucrative contracts, “but no one forces a tech company to do business with the federal government.”\nThat’s actually a very interesting idea. This benefits the govt as much as anyone else too. It reduces switching costs for govt tech.\nCan confirm, I’ve worked for a company doing govt contract work and I really don’t know what it’d take for us to have walked away. They can dictate whatever terms they like and still expect to find plenty of companies happy to bid for contracts I think.\nExcept the tech companies are among the politicians’ biggest “donors”.\nExcept the tech companies are among the politicians’ biggest “donors”.\nPublic cloud computing companies that want to host government IT workloads still have to be Fedramp compliant. Doesn’t matter how much their donors pay, if they aren’t Fedramp compliant they can’t bid for the work.\nThis is nice and all but any solution requires a government captured by capital to work against capital feels as likely to work as thoughts and prayers.\nBetter than completely allowing capital to do whatever it wants without even attempting to push back.\nYup. All of these “solutions” that sound original are known. The reason we don’t apply them isn’t because we don’t know how to solve these issues, it’s because capital has pulled the handbrake. This is the problem we have to solve. All the other problems fall downstream and will magically start getting solved if we can release the handbrake. If we’re not talking about how to reduce regulatory capture, we’re not taking about real solutions.",

    "title": "ICU Medical (NASDAQ:ICUI) Surprises With Q4 Sales",
    "text": "Medical device company ICU Medical (NASDAQ:ICUI) reported Q4 CY2024 results beating Wall Street’s revenue expectations, with sales up 7.1% year on year to $629.8 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.11 per share was 42.4% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy ICU Medical? Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free.\nICU Medical (ICUI) Q4 CY2024 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $629.8 million vs analyst estimates of $585.1 million (7.1% year-on-year growth, 7.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.11 vs analyst estimates of $1.48 (42.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $105.5 million vs analyst estimates of $95.36 million (16.8% margin, 10.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $6.90 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 3.2%\n- EBITDA guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $410 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $404.6 million\n- Operating Margin: 6%, up from -0.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 2.6%, down from 10.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $3.78 billion\nVivek Jain, ICU Medical’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Fourth quarter results were generally in line with our expectations with the exception of higher IV solutions revenues due to the U.S. market shortage.”\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1984, ICU Medical (NASDAQ:ICUI) provides medical devices and systems for infusion therapy, vascular access, and oncology (cancer) care.\nMedical Devices & Supplies - Cardiology, Neurology, Vascular\nThe medical devices and supplies industry, particularly in the fields of cardiology, neurology, and vascular care, benefits from a business model that balances innovation with relatively predictable revenue streams. These companies focus on developing life-saving devices such as stents, pacemakers, neurostimulation implants, and vascular access tools, which address critical and often chronic conditions. The recurring need for these devices, coupled with growing global demand for advanced treatments, provides stability and opportunities for long-term growth. However, the industry faces hurdles such as high research and development costs, rigorous regulatory approval processes, and reliance on reimbursement from healthcare systems, which can exert downward pressure on pricing. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned to benefit from tailwinds such as aging populations (which tend to have higher rates of disease) and technological advancements like minimally invasive procedures and connected devices that improve patient monitoring and outcomes. Innovations in robotic-assisted surgery and AI-driven diagnostics are also expected to accelerate adoption and expand treatment capabilities. However, potential headwinds include pricing pressures stemming from value-based care models and continued complexity changing from navigating regulatory frameworks that may prioritize further lowering healthcare costs.\nSales Growth\nA company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, ICU Medical’s 14.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was solid. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. ICU Medical’s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 2.2% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.\nICU Medical also breaks out the revenue for its most important segment, . Over the last two years, ICU Medical’s revenue averaged 3.3% year-on-year growth. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company’s performance.\nThis quarter, ICU Medical reported year-on-year revenue growth of 7.1%, and its $629.8 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 7.6%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.2% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nOperating Margin\nICU Medical was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.1% was weak for a healthcare business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, ICU Medical’s operating margin decreased by 4.2 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 5.6 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see ICU Medical become more profitable in the future.\nThis quarter, ICU Medical generated an operating profit margin of 6%, up 6.9 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was recently more efficient because its expenses grew slower than its revenue.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\nSadly for ICU Medical, its EPS declined by 5.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 14.5%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into ICU Medical’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, ICU Medical’s operating margin improved this quarter but declined by 4.2 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 14.5%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q4, ICU Medical reported EPS at $2.11, up from $1.57 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects ICU Medical’s full-year EPS of $6.22 to grow 11.9%.\nKey Takeaways from ICU Medical’s Q4 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly ICU Medical blew past analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed. Overall, this quarter was mixed. The stock remained flat at $150 immediately after reporting.\nICU Medical put up rock-solid earnings, but one quarter doesn’t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let’s see if this is a good investment. If you’re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free.",

    "text": "Toyota desmonta este gran argumento de los eléctricos\n-\nEl presidente de Toyota hunde el mito de que los coches eléctricos son los que menos contaminan\n-\nLos datos no mienten: los eléctricos contaminan tres veces más\n-\nLa estrategia de Toyota que arrincona a los coches eléctricos\nDesde el principio, tanto fabricantes de coches eléctricos y responsables de la industria, así como instituciones anticontaminación y gobiernos de muchos países, nos han vendido que buena parte de la solución para salvar el plantea pasa por eliminar los coches de combustión y apostar por los eléctricos. Automóviles que están intentando hacer tragar por activa y por pasiva a los consumidores.\nSin embargo, el mundo de los coches eléctricos tiene muchos puntos negros y esconde muchos secretos que, si se contaran, desmontarían muchos mitos. Akio Toyoda, presidente de Toyota, ha destrozado uno de los más importantes con un dato totalmente objetivo. Si los fabricantes no habían conseguido convencer a los consumidores, ahora estos serán menos tontos que nunca.\nLos coches eléctricos no son los que menos contaminan\n“Hemos vendido unos 27 millones de híbridos. Esos híbridos han tenido el mismo impacto que 9 millones de vehículos eléctricos de batería en circulación”. En otras palabras, Los coches eléctricos contaminan tres veces más que los híbridos. ¿No se supone que era al revés?\nLa clave está en la neutralidad de carbono. Es decir, que hay que tener en cuenta la contaminación que implica un coche, sea del tipo que sea, desde que se empieza a fabricar hasta que lo llevamos al desguace, pasando por el modo en que se genera la energía con la que se mueve. En este sentido, si la electricidad de las baterías no se obtiene de energías renovables, contamina tanto o más que un vehículo de combustión. Por no hablar de lo que cuesta extraer los materiales de las baterías o la destrucción de las mismas cuando a no sirven.\nToyota apuesta por mantener todas las opciones mecánicas\n“Si hubiéramos fabricado 9 millones de vehículos eléctricos de batería en Japón, en realidad habríamos aumentado las emisiones de carbono. Esto se debe a que Japón depende de las centrales térmicas para obtener electricidad, ha apuntado el ejecutivo.\nEs por eso que en Toyota siguen viendo más viable y recomendable seguir apostando por los modelos híbridos. “Deberíamos considerar todas las opciones y trabajar en todas las direcciones. Como empresa, hemos sido muy consecuentes al afirmar que luchamos contra el dióxido de carbono”, ha sentenciado.",

    "text": "The greatest salesman who ever lived scored big after the latest NATO summit. Ukraine’s Zelensky successfully convinced all NATO nations to pledge a collective $43 billion in funding to the never-ending war effort. These world leaders are openly willing to abandon their own nation’s economic needs in favor of Ukraine.\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been asked to step down from office due to the current state of Canada’s economy. Doubling down on his poor decisions, Trudeau has offered to purchase submarines and missiles for Zelensky. In fact, Canadian taxpayers are now on the hook for a C$500 million aid package . “The leaders discussed the defence needs of Ukraine and coordinated cooperation within the fighter jets coalition,” the Office of the President reported.\nNever to be outdone in terms of spending, the US already passed a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine back in April. They are continuing to send funds and expensive equipment overseas. US Secretary of State Blinken promised Zelensky the first found of F-16 fighter jets, which could range from $25 to $70 million a piece. Denmark and the Netherlands will aid in transferring the jets to Zelensky.\n“In addition, in the coming months, the United States and partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems,” Biden said. This will include German-made self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, NASAMS medium-range air defense systems, and variants of IRIS-T systems. All of NATO is ramping up Ukraine’s air force with at least 80 new jets en route.\nNATO said that the $43 billion is merely a “minimum baseline funding” as the blank checks will not cease. The current budget will fund a portion of the war into 2026, a clear indication that peace is not an option. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg admitted that the quickest way to end a war, preventing countless deaths, would be to “lose” a war. Yet, Stoltenberg insists that NATO cannot “yield to Putin.” We heard Biden claim during the last debate that Putin is hell-bent on conquering all of Europe despite Putin openly asking for a truce if NATO stops its aggressive tactics.\nThe summit leaders also mentioned that China is in their sites, calling President Xi a “decisive enabler.” NATO is warning China that it must cease funding Russia and then went as far as to question China’s nuclear arsenal and space expansion. The leaders are now asking Xi to arrange discussions to see how they may disarm China diplomatically.\nThe cycle of war has only just begun.",
