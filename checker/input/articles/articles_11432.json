    "text": "Image: Apple Apple announced some Godzilla-sized updates for its streaming service. First up, the spinoff series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters , which premiered on Apple TV Plus last year , has been renewed for a second season. There aren’t any details on what the new season will entail or when it’ll start streaming, but showrunners and co-creators Chris Black and Matt Fraction will be returning.\nOn top of that, Apple says that it has signed a deal with Legendary for even more projects based in its “monsterverse,” which will include “multiple spinoff series.” It’s not clear yet what those series might be, but here’s hoping we get a deep dive into the Shobijin . The news comes just a few weeks after the latest feature in the franchise, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire , hit theaters.\nIt’s been a fairly busy day for Apple TV Plus. In addition to the kaiju news, the streamer also released the first trailer for its upcoming sci-fi thriller Dark Matter , which stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Connelly and starts streaming on May 8th.\nSource link",

    "title": "'Dark era' over, Bowling Green sizes up Arkansas State in 68 Ventures Bowl",
    "text": "Bowling Green coach Scot Loeffler is happy for the seniors on his roster who persevered through what he called the program's \"dark era.\" The Falcons' senior class would love nothing more than to go out with a win in the 68 Ventures Bowl against Arkansas State on Thursday in Mobile, Ala. Bowling Green (7-5) last won a bowl game in 2014. The program suffered seven straight losing seasons from 2016-22, exceeding four wins just once before its recent turnaround. \"I'm super proud of the guys that have been part of this program for four, five and six years,\" Loeffler said, per the Toledo Blade. \"They were part of the dark era, as I would say, and they really have made this place a competitive, hard-working, do-right program.\" One subplot is star tight end Harold Fannin Jr.'s pursuit of multiple FBS records. Fannin enters the bowl game with 100 receptions for 1,342 yards and nine touchdowns. If he gains just 11 yards against Arkansas State, Fannin will break Jace Amaro's single-season record for tight ends set in 2013. Fannin is also 12 catches away from setting the single-season receptions record at the position (James Casey, 111, 2008). Fannin was the first tight end in FBS history to be named a conference's player of the year when the Mid-American Conference gave him the honor. \"He's phenomenal. Phenomenal athlete, really good guy, too,\" Falcons linebacker Brock Horne said. \"... Obviously, he helped out the team a ton, and just looking forward to him putting the orange and brown on one more time and having a good bowl game.\" \"He needs to go to the National Football League as fast as he can,\" Loeffler added. Arkansas State (7-5) won four of its final six games in the regular season to join the ranks of the bowl-eligible. The Red Wolves' last winning season was 2019, which was capped off by their most recent bowl win. It's been their best showing under coaching veteran Butch Jones, who's led Cincinnati and Tennessee to bowl victories before. \"We have to be better than we were (at Monday's practice) from a fundamental execution standpoint, from a habit standpoint,\" Jones said. \"All that goes into playing winning football. But I like our mindset so far.\" Arkansas State's Jaylen Raynor threw for 2,562 yards with 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Zak Wallace led a multipronged rushing attack with 622 yards and 10 touchdowns. The greater concern is the Red Wolves' defense, which allowed 32.3 points per game and 460.7 yards per game, the latter ranking sixth-to-worst in FBS. \"Obviously we've been decimated up front in the defensive line with some season-ending injuries,\" Jones said. \"But right now, we're as healthy as we can possibly be since going through a long season.\" Bowling Green, conversely, allowed just 20.3 points per game. Falcons quarterback Connor Bazelak passed for 2,654 yards and 15 touchdowns this season. Terion Stewart led the ground game with 890 yards and six scores. --Field Level Media\n'Dark era' over, Bowling Green sizes up Arkansas State in 68 Ventures Bowl\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nSuccess!

    "text": "The US army has confirmed that the man who [murdered a Louth woman at her home in New York](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41270170.html) was a former soldier. Denise Morgan, from Tullyallen suffered a gunshot wound to the head and neck during a row with her former partner Joed A Taveras in Queens on October 21. The mother of one had ended the relationship and was preparing to move to a new apartment with her daughter when she died. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered the remains of Ms Morgan and Mr Tavaras, who had turned the gun on himself. In a statement, the US army press office told thethat Mr Tavaras held a previous position of “specialist” within the defence forces. “He held the rank of specialist at the end of service,\" it said. “Due to Privacy Act constraints, we are unable to provide the characterization of discharge for any soldier. “Army policy controls a current soldier’s access to government firearms and participation in live fire exercises but does not extend to possession of personal firearms by former soldiers.\" An online obituary for Mr Tavaras said he served four years as a tanker, deploying in 2013, before he was “dishonourably discharged”. Ms Morgan’s family previously told thethat they will “never get justice” for Denise, but that they wanted to warn others about the dangers of controlling behaviours. Lisa Morgan said: “He was trying to cut her off from people. “I was though, afraid of what he would do if he knew Denise was leaving. There were red flags and we knew he was controlling. But no one expected this. We just hope that people will be careful when they are leaving an abusive relationship because she was living with him for five years. You would never see this coming.\"",

    "text": "“Un duro golpe para el sistema”: los médicos advierten por salida del mercado del inhalador para asma Flovent\nAlexandra Ferguson\n(CNN) — A partir del 1 de enero, un medicamento que ayuda a respirar a miles de pacientes desaparecerá de las farmacias, y a los médicos les preocupa que los pacientes puedan tener problemas para cambiar a otras alternativas y conseguir que el seguro las cubra.\nEl fabricante GSK anunció que dejará de comercializar el inhalador Flovent para el asma y que, en su lugar, fabricará una versión “genérica autorizada”, idéntica pero sin la misma marca.\nLos médicos que tratan a pacientes con asma afirman que el genérico autorizado funcionará igual de bien que el medicamento de marca, pero no parece tener la misma cobertura por parte de las aseguradoras. Eso puede significar que los pacientes tendrán que obtener nuevas recetas y sortear obstáculos de cobertura en plena temporada de virus respiratorios.\n“Este medicamento ha sido el fármaco inhalado más utilizado en los últimos 25 o 30 años”, afirma la Dra. Robyn Cohen, neumóloga pediátrica del Boston Medical Center. “Es el que, en su inmensa mayoría, los pediatras eligen cuando deciden que su paciente necesita una medicación preventiva diaria… El hecho de que se suspenda supondrá un golpe enorme para el sistema, tanto para los pacientes como para las familias y los médicos”.\nLos médicos instan a los pacientes a que tomen medidas ahora para asegurarse de que disponen de su medicación de cara al nuevo año, y los grupos de defensa de los derechos de los pacientes han intentado hacer correr la voz.\nPero la historia de la desaparición de Flovent y la falta de cobertura de su sustituto, aparentemente idéntico, afecta a algunas de las facetas más complejas de la atención sanitaria y los precios de los medicamentos en Estados Unidos.\nCVS cambiará la forma en que fija los precios de los medicamentos recetados en EE.UU. ¿que significa?\nImportante cambio en el programa de medicamentos de Medicaid\nUna portavoz de GSK dijo que la compañía está haciendo el cambio “como parte de nuestro compromiso de ser ambiciosos para los pacientes”.\nSeñaló que la compañía introdujo los genéricos autorizados de Flovent HFA, un aerosol de inhalación, y Flovent Diskus, un polvo de inhalación, en mayo de 2022 y octubre de 2023, y que, posteriormente, dejaría de fabricar las versiones de patente en Estados Unidos el 1 de enero de 2024.\nLos genéricos autorizados, dijo, “proporcionarán a los pacientes en EE.UU. alternativas potencialmente más baratas de estos productos médicamente importantes”.\nSin embargo, los expertos que siguen la industria tanto en Wall Street como en el mundo académico señalan que GSK está haciendo el cambio precisamente en el momento en que un cambio en los reembolsos de Medicaid podría hacer que la empresa tuviera que pagar grandes multas debido a los aumentos de precio de Flovent durante varios años.\nFarmacéuticos advierten que los medicamentos “suben por encima de la inflación”\nEl cambio legal que entrará en vigor el 1 de enero suprime un límite a los reembolsos de Medicaid que las empresas están obligadas a pagar si aumentan el precio de los medicamentos por encima de la inflación.\n“Flovent Diskus lleva en el mercado desde 2000 y Flovent HFA desde 2004, y GSK ha subido el precio de ambos productos en numerosas ocasiones desde su lanzamiento”, declaró a CNN el Dr. William Feldman, médico adjunto de la División de Medicina Pulmonar y Cuidados Críticos del Hospital Brigham and Women’s que estudia los medicamentos para el asma. “Estos son precisamente el tipo de fármacos que se verán afectados por la nueva política que elimina el tope de reembolso de Medicaid”.\nHasta ahora, los reembolsos tenían un tope en el precio total de un medicamento, por lo que los fabricantes nunca pagarían más de lo que cuesta un medicamento de vuelta a Medicaid.\nPero en virtud de una disposición de la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de 2021, ese límite se eliminó, y a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, los medicamentos que han estado sujetos a grandes aumentos de precios a lo largo del tiempo podrían terminar incurriendo en reembolsos a Medicaid que son mayores que su precio, lo que significa que las compañías farmacéuticas venderían esos medicamentos a Medicaid con pérdidas.\n“Obviamente, las farmacéuticas no quieren vender con pérdidas nada de su cartera”, afirma Andrew Baum, analista de GSK y otras farmacéuticas para la firma financiera Citi. “Así que busca evadir el impacto mediante, uno: la discontinuación y dos: el genérico autorizado”.\nUn genérico autorizado, dijo Baum a CNN, es visto como un producto separado, “pero aún permite a la farmacéutica recoger parte de la rentabilidad”.\nO, dicho de otro modo, es el mismo producto sin la marca y también sin el historial de subidas de precio que dejarían al medicamento vulnerable a esos grandes reembolsos a Medicaid.\nSegún datos de GoodRx, el precio de la marca Flovent ha subido alrededor del 47% desde 2014.\nOtros fabricantes de medicamentos también han hecho cambios antes de la eliminación del límite de reembolso del 1 de enero. Los fabricantes de insulina anunciaron este año importantes recortes de precios, del 70% o más, en sus productos, una medida que los analistas estiman que les ahorrará cientos de millones de dólares al año.\nLa estrategia de genéricos autorizados que está empleando GSK “es una forma, en términos generales, de maximizar la rentabilidad del producto en cuestión”, dijo David Amsellem, analista financiero que cubre el sector en la firma de inversión Piper Sandler.\nAmsellem señaló que actualmente no hay otras versiones genéricas de Flovent aprobadas por la FDA.\nPor ejemplo, un envase de Flovent HFA en la dosis de 110 microgramos cuesta US$ 273,83, aproximadamente un 50% más que el costo de adquisición al por mayor de US$ 177,99 de su homólogo genérico autorizado, según los precios que la empresa comunicó a CNN. El costo de adquisición al por mayor es el precio antes de seguros y descuentos.\nPero CVS Caremark, un importante gestor de beneficios farmacéuticos que determina qué medicamentos están cubiertos por el seguro para sus miembros, está dando un lugar preferencial a otro inhalador de marca, Pulmicort, en su formulario, en lugar de las versiones genéricas autorizadas de Flovent.\n“En este caso, los genéricos autorizados eran más caros que los medicamentos de marca”, dijo un portavoz de CVS a CNN. Señaló que se basa en los precios netos, en lugar del costo de adquisición al por mayor, lo que significa que Pulmicort podría ser menos costoso debido a los descuentos que su fabricante, AstraZeneca, paga para obtener una mejor cobertura de seguro.\n“El peor momento del año”\nEl hecho de que los planes de seguro no estén cubriendo ampliamente el genérico autorizado de Flovent, dijo Cohen de BMC, “significa que los pacientes van a tener que obtener una nueva receta para un medicamento completamente diferente en medio de la peor época posible del año, que es la temporada de virus respiratorios de invierno”.\nPara los pacientes con asma persistente, dijo Cohen, Flovent ha sido el medicamento antiinflamatorio preventivo diario más utilizado durante décadas. Contrae la inflamación de las vías respiratorias y reduce la respuesta exagerada del organismo a los desencadenantes que dificultan la respiración.\nA medida que los virus respiratorios se propagan por todas partes, ¿qué debes hacer si te enfermas?\nDurante la temporada de influenza y resfriados, dice, es aún más importante disponer de ese medicamento diario.\n“La influenza, el covid, el virus respiratorio sincitial, todos estos virus que circulan en estos momentos, son uno de los principales desencadenantes, si no el principal, de los ataques de asma en los niños”, explica Cohen. “Esto es lo que hace que los niños lleguen a urgencias”.\nCohen dijo que le preocupa que los pacientes, así como los médicos y farmacéuticos, no sepan sobre este cambio sobre Flovent, y tienen que actuar ahora para encontrar alternativas y determinar la cobertura del seguro.\nVirus respiratorios amenazan a EE.UU.: ¿cómo debemos protegernos?\nPara algunos grupos, las alternativas son más limitadas. Para los pacientes con una enfermedad inflamatoria más rara, llamada esofagitis eosinofílica (EoE), Flovent HFA es uno de los esteroides tópicos más recetados, y otros medicamentos no tienen tantos datos que respalden su uso en la enfermedad, dijo la Dra. Erin Syverson, médica adjunta de la División de Gastroenterología, Hepatología y Nutrición del Hospital Infantil de Boston.\nDado que la EoE afecta al esófago, los pacientes ingieren el medicamento en lugar de respirarlo, y éste puede controlar la inflamación que puede causar dolor al tragar o que la comida se atasque, lo que requiere procedimientos para extraerla. Según Syverson, en los niños la EoE puede provocar vómitos recurrentes, ardor y dolor de estómago, y dificultades para empezar a tomar alimentos sólidos.\n“Me preocupa que la interrupción del tratamiento vaya a suponer un obstáculo más para una población de pacientes que ya dispone de una medicación muy limitada”, declaró Syverson a CNN. “No sé cómo será enero, pero estoy preocupada”.\n— Tami Luhby de CNN contribuyó con este reportaje.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Africa-Press – Benin. L’Union Progressiste Le Renouveau (UP-R) a lancé une série d’activités pour commémorer le 35è anniversaire de la Conférence nationale des Forces Vives de la Nation. Parmi ces initiatives figurent des célébrations religieuses visant à prier pour la paix au Bénin. Cependant, cette démarche ne fait pas l’unanimité.\nDans une publication sur sa page Facebook, le samedi 15 février 2025, Candide Azannaï, président du parti Restaurer l’Espoir (RE) et Coordonnateur national de la Résistance nationale, a vivement critiqué cette initiative. Il accuse l’UP-R et ses alliés d’instrumentaliser les lieux de culte à des fins politiques et de chercher à redorer leur image en exploitant la foi des chrétienne.\nSelon Candide Azannaï, les acteurs politiques à l’origine de ces célébrations religieuses sont les mêmes qui ont, par le passé, fragilisé les acquis du Renouveau démocratique. Il leur reproche d’avoir favorisé l’exclusion, l’emprisonnement et l’exil de figures de l’opposition.\n« Ils ont renié la Conférence nationale et fragilisé les acquis du Renouveau démocratique. Ils ont exclu, emprisonné et poussé à l’exil… Maintenant, qui pensent-ils convaincre dans nos temples, églises et mosquées ? » a-t-il écrit.\nL’ancien ministre de la Défense s’indigne également du silence de l’UP-R sur les dérives qu’il dénonce et met en garde contre toute tentative de manipulation de la foi à des fins politiques: « Même si des prêtres, imams ou pasteurs recevaient leurs offrandes, la justice divine transcende toute manœuvre humaine. »\nCette critique intervient dans un contexte où les tensions politiques restent vives à l’approche des élections générales de 2026. Pour certains observateurs, les prières initiées par l’UP-R sont une démarche sincère en faveur de la paix et de la stabilité nationale. Pour d’autres, elles relèvent d’une stratégie politique visant à séduire une frange de l’électorat en quête de réconciliation et de légitimité morale.\nLa question reste donc posée: cette initiative de l’UP-R est-elle une véritable démarche spirituelle ou une opération de communication ou d’hypocrisie politique ?\nPour plus d’informations et d’analyses sur la Benin, suivez Africa-Press",

    "text": "Investing News Network Feb. 27, 2025 12:55PM PST Cleantech Investing\nplay icon\n“We think it's time for a cleantech alternative … (and) we offer the only alternative to this $2 billion global problem,” said Duane Nelson, CEO of Innovation Mining.\nInnovation Mining is set to revolutionize the gold extraction industry with a groundbreaking, non-toxic alternative to cyanide. The company claims its new solution matches cyanide’s gold recovery efficiency while eliminating its environmental and safety concerns.\n“Ninety percent of the world’s gold is produced using cyanide, and there really is no alternative,” said Duane Nelson, CEO of Innovation Mining. “We made a discovery (in our Vancouver chemistry lab) of a particular formula that is now producing the same results as cyanide, same recoveries for the same price, but it's non-toxic.”\nThe company has conducted thousands of tests on different ores, tailings and concentrates, with independent validation from SGS Labs in Vancouver confirming the new solution's performance, Nelson said.\nThe potential economic benefits are also significant. The global cyanide market for gold mining is valued at approximately $2 billion annually, he explained.\nScalability has been a crucial focus for the company, as well. “We've gone from beaker to 1 kilo column test to 100 kilo column test to 250 kilo VAT leach tests. We're not seeing any change in the chemical composition or degradation, or any changes in the recovery on scale,” Nelson said, highlighting the technology’s ability to scale in a commercial mining environment.\nWith an initial public offering scheduled for the second quarter of the year, Innovation Mining is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable mining solutions. “We think it's time for a cleantech alternative … (and) we offer the only alternative to this $2 billion global problem,” the chief executive said.\nWatch the full interview with Duane Nelson, CEO of Innovation Mining, above.\nDisclaimer: This interview is sponsored by Innovation Mining .
