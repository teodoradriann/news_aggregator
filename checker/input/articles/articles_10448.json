    "text": "- Microsoft released tools to address security issues with its AI assistant Copilot.\n- Copilot's indexing of internal data led to oversharing of sensitive company information.\n- Some corporate customers delayed Copilot deployment because of security and oversharing concerns.\nRecommended articles\nMicrosoft's [Copilot](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-artificial-intelligence-bet-doubts-marc-benioff-satya-nadella-2024-11) has been doing an [AI](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-mustafa-suleyman-ai-copilot-update-reviews-2024-10) version of this behavior, which has unnerved corporate customers so much that some have delayed deploying the product, as Business Insider first [reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-artificial-intelligence-bet-doubts-marc-benioff-satya-nadella-2024-11) last week.\nNow the software giant is trying to fix the problem. On Tuesday, [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hints-big-change-to-openai-investments-sec-filing-2024-10) released new tools and a guide to help customers mitigate a Copilot security issue that inadvertently let employees access sensitive information such as CEO emails and HR documents.\nThese updates are designed \"to identify and mitigate oversharing and ongoing governance concerns,\" the company said in a [blueprint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-blueprint-oversharing) for Microsoft's 365 productivity software suite.\n\"Many data-governance challenges in the context of AI were not caused by AI's arrival,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told BI on Wednesday.\nThe spokesperson added that AI was simply the latest call to action for enterprises to take proactive management of their internal documents and other information.\nThe spokesperson said factors such as specific industry regulations and risk tolerance should inform these decisions. For instance, different employees should have access to different types of files, workspaces, and other resources.\n\"Microsoft is helping customers enhance their central governance of identities and permissions, to help organizations continuously update and manage these fundamental controls,\" the spokesperson said.\nCopilot's magic — its ability to create a 10-slide road-mapping presentation, or to summon a list of your company's most profitable products — works by browsing andindexing all your company's internal information, like the web crawlers used by search engines.\nIT departments at some companies have set up lax permissions for who can access internal documents — selecting \"allow all\" for the company's HR software, say, rather than going through the trouble of selecting specific users.\nThat didn't create much of a problem because there wasn't a tool that an average employee could use to identify and retrieve sensitive company documents — until Copilot.\nAs a result, some customers have deployed Copilot only to discover that it can let employees read an executive's inbox or access sensitive HR documents.\n\"Now when Joe Blow logs into an account and kicks off Copilot, they can see everything,\" a Microsoft employee familiar with customer complaints said. \"All of a sudden Joe Blow can see the CEO's emails.\"\nAre you a Microsoft employee or someone else with insight to share?\nContact Ashley Stewart via the encrypted messaging app Signal (+1-425-344-8242) or email ([astewart@businessinsider.com](mailto:astewart@businessinsider.com)).

    "text": "More on KentOnline People are being urged to keep their distance ahead of efforts to recover a dead whale washed ashore. The marine giant was first [discovered by a dog walker and his son](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/massive-whale-found-washed-up-onshore-299249/) off the River Thames in a remote part of Cliffe, on the [Hoo Peninsula](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/), yesterday. The Port of London Authority (PLA) has since confirmed it to be a juvenile female fin species. It had initially been believed to be a Minke whale but images posted to social media have helped the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme correctly reclassify it. In the meantime efforts to remove the whale have been hampered by Storm Gerrit. It is believed either a hide tide and strong winds have caused a mooring line to come loose. The whale remains on shore but is now further inland with a red strap and rope attached to it by the PLA as part of the recovery process. It is believed either a hide tide and strong winds have caused a mooring line to come loose. A spokesman for the PLA said: \"Currently the body of a whale that washed up on Wednesday at Cliffe is still on the foreshore. \"Our Marine Services team is working to determine the safest way to remove the body. \"Recovery efforts have been hampered by Storm Gerrit, the mudflats along the rocky foreshore and limited road access at the site. \"The removal of a buoy also set back our ability to remove the whale on Friday, [although] weather conditions appear likely to improve early next week.” The public are being asked to keep their distance and not to interfere with the carcass or remove any equipment. The spokesman added: \"As with any wild animal carcass, there is a risk of it carrying harmful bacteria, including due to decomposition - people should keep their distance.” New drone images from photographer and drone operator Geoff Watkins show the whale further inland today. Mr Watkins, who runs Aerial Imaging South East, captured images of the sad spectacle from above. Jack Theed, 33, who came across the whale yesterday, told KentOnline: \"It was just absolutely massive. \"I've lived in Cliffe for 23 years and never seen anything like this before. \"The bit I walked around isn't somewhere a lot of people go. \"I would guess it’s about 30ft, but it's hard to gauge of course.\"",

Apple está diseñando el Siri más capaz para competir mejor con chatbots como ChatGPT, con planes para utilizar «modelos avanzados de lenguaje grande».\nRelated El ChatGPT francés de código abierto se pone los pantalones ChatGPT Search: ya está acá el competidor del buscador de Google Tu historial de conversaciones de ChatGPT ahora se puede buscar Una versión de chatbot de Siri sería capaz de mantener conversaciones continuas, al igual que ChatGPT. Apple quiere que los clientes puedan conversar mejor con el asistente personal, con Siri respondiendo más como un humano. El uso de grandes modelos de lenguaje también permitirá a Siri realizar tareas mucho más complejas, para las que Apple tiene que confiar en ChatGPT de OpenAI en iOS 18.2.\nPara esa funcionalidad, Apple utilizará un LLM de Apple de primera generación para evaluar las solicitudes y determinar si se debe usar la infraestructura de Siri existente o si se debe consultar un segundo LLM que pueda manejar solicitudes más complejas.\nApple está probando la nueva Siri en una aplicación separada en iPhones, iPads y Macs, pero eventualmente reemplazará a la versión actual de Siri. La actualización de Siri podría anunciarse tan pronto como en 2025, probablemente como parte de la Conferencia Mundial de Desarrolladores de junio en la que Apple presentará iOS 19.\nSin embargo, un lanzamiento definitivo recién debería estar para la primavera boreal de 2026.\nRecomendaciones del editor ChatGPT ya habla, ahora también podrá verte Esta actualización masiva de ChatGPT llegará en enero, y no es GPT-5 El modo de voz avanzado de ChatGPT acaba de llegar a PC y Mac El mismo Apple cree que Siri no está listo para vencer a ChatGPT ¿ChatGPT tendrá una marca de agua para pillar a los tramposos?",

    "text": "WILTON — As a parent, a lot of hard work goes into getting your children’s gifts ready for the holidays.\nAmazon carts are filled and emptied, stockings are stuffed, credit cards are abused and a lot of hours are spent in long lines, eventually leading to the picturesque moment when wrapping paper is ripped open and the gifts you’ve been anxiously waiting for them to see are finally revealed. All the hours of hard work make the moment so meaningful for a parent, it’s almost indescribable.\nFinding out that said gift found its way into a tree or is sitting atop the ice cover of a lake fifty feet from shore awakens an entirely different set of feelings, which are perfectly describable.\nBrianna Simeon found herself in that very position when her 12 year-old son Carter Simeon managed to get his brand new remote controlled airplane struck not once, but twice.\nThe first occurrence happened on Monday, Dec. 25. The plane was a gift to Carter from his grandmother. Currently on break from Mt. Blue Middle School, Carter has a big interest in planes and aviation, with his recent focus being on World War II model airplanes.\nWith his new gift in hand, Carter took to the skies and let his plane fly at Kineowatha Park, but the plane soon found itself stuck in one of the trees by the entrance way.\nWith the help of Wilton Fire and Rescue, as well as the Wilton Police Department, Carter had his plane back in his hands and was ready to fly once again.\nHis flight would be delayed, however, when on Tuesday, Dec. 26, his plane landed on the ice cover of Wilson Lake roughly 50 feet from the shoreline. With half of the lake starting to freeze over, the ice foundation on top of Wilson Lake bought the boy and his parents some time to find ways to snag it.\nThe Franklin Journal was nearby when Simeon and her son arrived with a roof rake stretching 25 ft. that barely made it halfway to its destination.\n“I have been trying since about 11 in the morning,” she said.\nWith the roof rake unsuccessful, Simeon returned home to grab her kayak to see if she could break the ice and get to the plane that way. Unwilling to bother the fire department again, she was determined to rescue the plane by her own means.\nThe ice proved too thick, unfortunately, and after a valiant attempt to break her way through, Simeon was forced back to the shore. By then, her husband Luis Simeon had arrived to see what he could offer the situation. Searching through his truck, Luis pulled out a couple of fishing rods and tried to see if he could snag the plane from the shore.\nAfter trying with two fishing poles came up short, it was time to pack it in and call it a day.\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 27, Brianna shared an update with The Franklin Journal, telling that the plane was still trapped atop the ice. The first attempt at dislodging it with a remote controlled car proved unsuccessful due to the ice being too slippery to get any traction.\nAfter Hulu hoops with rope tied to them also yielded no results, Simeon said it was back to the drawing board. She hopes to find a way to rescue the plane before snow and rainfall could potentially bury, and eventually sink, the plane.\nSimeon asked if any local residents are able to retrieve the plane, to please contact her at [702] 612-3680.\nSuccess.

    "text": "US lawmaker claims crypto PACs forced out ’important voices in Congress’\nRepresentative Summer Lee took aim at crypto-backed Super PACs funding media buys that could have contributed to two Democratic lawmakers losing their primaries.\nNews\nCOINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED\nPennsylvania Representative Summer Lee staunchly criticized cryptocurrency-backed political action committees (PACs) for funding ads “demonizing” candidates in 2024 primaries — often for reasons unrelated to digital assets.\nSpeaking at an Oct. 24 virtual event hosted by Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, Rep. Lee took aim at the “influence and control” special interest groups like crypto Super PACs used to target lawmakers running for reelection in 2024.\nThe Pennsylvania Representative claimed that money from the digital asset industry was being used to “silence the few representatives actually fighting to hold them accountable.”\n“[Y]ou can distort the conversation if you have enough money,” said Rep. Lee. “Look at what they did to my colleagues and friends Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. We’re talking about a nurse and a principal [...] in those races, the crypto PACs spent more than $3 million to unseat them [...] we lost some of the most important voices in Congress.”\nShe added:\n“It’s about keeping regular people out and letting the big players take over, and crypto knows this. They know regular people can’t go up, against, over $134 million in spending in one cycle. They’re exploiting the system, and they’re obscuring what their actual interests are in these races.”\nRep. Lee referred to actions by the\nFairshake PAC, which funded media buys opposing Bowman, the Representative for New York’s 16th Congressional District, and Bush, the Representative for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District. Both Democratic candidateslost their respective primariesin June and August after the crypto PAC poured more than $3 million combined into the two races.Cointelegraph reached out to a Fairshake spokesperson for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.\nIn August — after Rep. Bush lost her primary — Fairshake’s Josh Vlasto\nclaimed the Missouri representativewas an “anti-crypto, Elizabeth Warren-endorsed lawmaker,” suggesting that the crypto industry would support candidates favorable to its interests.“What we’re arguing is not that folks, industries, interests shouldn’t have a say in our democracy,” said Rep. Lee, referring to crypto and other interest groups. “What we’re saying is that they shouldn’t have the loudest say. They shouldn’t have an outsized say.”\nTexas Blockchain CouncilPresident Lee Bratcher told Cointelegraph at the Permissionless conference on Oct. 10 that the crypto PACs’ activity and industry leaders funding campaigns was a “function of how democracy works.”\n“People are realizing that using funds to get face time and get bandwidth to educate elected officials… it’s almost like a function of the market,” said Bratcher. “If you want to educate someone, you have to have time to do that. To get time to do that, you have to be a big part of their campaign.”\n12 days until the US election — money is still flowing\nMany crypto Super PACs continue to report expenditures supporting or against candidates in the 2024 election cycle, even as millions of US residents go to the ballot boxes for early voting.\nWith control of the House of Representatives and the Senate up for grabs depending on the results of crucial congressional elections, Fairshake and its affiliate Defend American Jobs\nreported spending $1.3 millionto support candidates across five US states to the Federal Election Commission on Oct. 17.The PAC continues to fund media buys as Election Day on Nov. 5 looms. Fairshake\nspentmore than $1.8 million to support California Representative Young Kim and more than $800,000 for Texas Representative Monica De La Cruz Hernandez.Protect Progress, another Fairshake affiliate,\nreportedmedia buys supporting Virginia Representative Suhas Subramanyam and California Representative Rohit Khanna.Though many of crypto PACs’ media buys targeted congressional races, the US presidential race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump isn’t entirely off-limits.

    "title": "'You can marry multiple times, but all wives must be treated equally': Madras HC cites Sharia law to dissolve marriage of Muslim man",
    "text": "On December 22, 2023, the Madra High Court upheld the annulment of a marriage, [holding](https://www.verdictum.in/court-updates/high-courts/muslim-husband-treat-all-wives-equally-per-islamic-law-madras-high-court-1512117) that while Islamic Law allows polygamy, equal treatment of all wives is essential and failing to do so amounts to cruelty. The bench comprising Justices Rmt. Teekaa Raman and Justice PB Balaji dismissed an appeal filed by the Husband against the Family Court’s judgement and order dissolving the marriage between the parties under Section 2(ii)(iv)(viii)(a)(d) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (Act). The Court stated that the wife convincingly demonstrated that the husband treated her unfairly in comparison to his second wife, refused to provide care and support, and neglected marital commitments after their separation while she lived with her parents. “Thereby, he has not treated the first wife and the second wife equally as required under the provisions of Islamic Law. Under Islamic Law, the husband is entitled for Polygamous marriage, however, he has to treat all the wife equally,” the court observed. Advocate K. Abiya appeared for the Appellant Mukmuthu Sha and Advocate C. Jeya Indira Patel appeared for the Respondent Afrin Banu. The first wife described harassment from her husband, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law, alleging neglect during pregnancy, food allergies, and cruelty following a miscarriage. “Without considering that the plaintiff is pregnant, the mother of the husband/defendant scolded her for not properly draping the saree, and the husband also took photos of the plaintiff and the defendant while they were intimate position.” A child was born to the parties when the plaintiff/wife went to Chennai to live with her husband in September 2016. However, the child died the following day. On that score, the husband’s sister “abused the wife by stating that she could solemnise another marriage of the defendant/husband since the plaintiff/wife has no child,” the wife alleged. She went on to accuse her spouse of unfair comparisons and emotional abuse, prompting her to leave the matrimonial home. While the husband denied these allegations, the court’s examination of the evidence proved his cruelty and neglect towards his first wife and failure to fulfil marital obligations to her. The ruling emphasised his lack of effort to support her while she was with her parents, which contributed to the dissolution ruling. The High Court upheld the Tirunelveli Family Court’s verdict, concluding that the husband’s unequal treatment and failure to support his first wife justified the couple’s separation. The Bench, thus, dismissed the husband’s appeal, upholding the initial decision.",

    "text": "北京商业航天企业穿越者载人航天近日完成了亚轨道载人飞船可重复使用主动防热技术验证试验。中国振动工程学会振动与噪声控制专业委员会副理事长向树红评价，这是我国商业航天领域首次主动防热技术验证试验，证明了飞船主动防热技术的有效性，以及该技术在再入飞行器领域应用的潜力。\n当飞船再入大气层时，舱体与空气的剧烈摩擦会产生高温。“目前常用的被动防热技术，本质是‘以牺牲换生存’，不能重复使用。”向树红说，防热是载人飞船独有的关键技术挑战之一。主动防热技术是当前新兴的热防护理念。\n“为了研发可循环使用的‘防火墙’，我们在地面模拟‘宇宙焰火’。”该企业创始人、首席执行官雷诗情介绍，最终，团队在试验材料上加工了大量毫米级直径的微型气道，低温气体从中喷出，形成气膜墙，起到防火作用。\n在试验现场，持续两个小时的试验中，试验件的核心结构温度稳定在600摄氏度以下，材料没有出现熔融或变形，冷却效率达58%。雷诗情表示，团队将持续优化载人飞船产品，特别是将针对飞船返回舱再入过程中舱体受热最严重的部位，开展主动防热系统的优化设计，力求以最低的系统重量实现最大的防热效果。\n该企业计划在2026年进行国内首次全尺寸载人飞船亚轨道无人飞行试验。届时，飞船将局部搭载此次试验的主动防热技术，开展飞行验证。预计在两次同类试验后，2028年亚轨道载人飞行有望实现。普通人也将有机会遨游太空。\n来源：北京日报\n记者：刘苏雅\n 流程编辑：u028\n如遇作品内容、版权等问题，请在相关文章刊发之日起30日内与本网联系。版权侵权联系电话：010-85202353",
