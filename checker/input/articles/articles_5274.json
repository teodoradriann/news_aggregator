    "title": "Off-road drivers were swept away by river, says man who tried to save them | Salisbury Journal",
    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.

    "title": "China Work for an End to War and World Peace – Donald Ramotar - Kaieteur News",
    "text": "Latest update December 30th, 2023 12:59 AM Dec 30, 2023 [Letters](https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/category/letters/) The year 2023 was by all accounts, a very eventful one. While we see great prospects for the future advancement of humankind, at the same time, the challenges and dangers have been great, often threatening our own destruction. It is unfortunate that many important countries in the world, mainly in the West, are adapting positions that create conditions for conflicts and more conflicts. The very few proposals and efforts are being pushed by other countries, especially the People’s Republic of China. It is in an atmosphere of real danger to humankind that President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China made some groundbreaking proposals. When taken together these proposals can lead the international community on a road of stability and peace. They are the “Global Development Initiative” (GDI), the “Global Security Initiative” (GSI) and the “Global Civilization Initiative” (GCI). The initiatives have captured the imagination of the world generally and more particularly, it took into consideration the specific circumstances of each country. This is brought out strongly in the GCI. President Xi was able to show the interconnections between world peace, socio-economic development, and national security. During this year as well, the PRC was heavily involved in making efforts at the diplomatic level to resolve many of the very serious and knotty problems in our time. Recall that early in the year, President Xi proposed a twelve-point measure to resolve the conflict in which Russia and Ukraine have been caught. President Putin welcomed the proposals as a good basis for dialogue with Ukraine and the West. Those measures captured some very important aspects of the conflict and principles that could be applied generally in their resolution. These included territorial integrity; mutual security in which no country should seek greater security at the expense of another; no use of nuclear weapons, indeed President Xi insisted on the principle that nuclear weapons should never be used, and a nuclear war never fought. Unfortunately, the US and its NATO allies have not yet taken up this sound proposal. However, as the war in Ukraine drags on, we are beginning to witness some realism on the part of the Western powers. President Xi’s proposal is a good basis to begin talks. The most burning issue in the international arena at present is the devastation of Gaza and the slaughter of the people there, including a large number of children and babies. Here too the Chinese government has made very sound proposals to end the attacks of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine. At the Security Council of the United Nations, the PRC called for an immediate cease fire as the indispensable step towards resolving the tragic killings in Gaza. As a permanent settlement of the conflict, the proposal of a two-state solution was emphasized. A viable Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. Unfortunately, the United States used its veto powers at the Security Council and General Assembly of the UN to allow Israel to continue its carpet bombing of the Gaza. In addition, they have supplied Israel with the most sophisticated weapons to use against the Palestinians. In recent times, we have observed that more and more states have been adopting the call for a cease fire and a two-state solution. Millions on the streets are calling for this, thus we are optimistic that a permanent solution is line with China’s proposal is emerging. The Chinese government has been working tirelessly to ease the tension in the Middle East. This area is one of the most dangerous in our world. Its endeavours have met with much success. The most notable was its mediation which led Iran and Saudia Arabia to resume diplomatic relations. Already the two countries have assigned ambassadors to the capitals of each other countries. This would bring great benefits to the people of those two countries and to the region as a whole. The role of the PRC has been welcomed and lauded. Finally, the Chinese administration have displayed remarkable restraint in the face of provocation by the United States in relation to its internal affairs, on the “Taiwan” issue. The U.S. has been encouraging separatist forces in Taiwan to seek independence. They have even been arming Taiwan and have taken several provocative steps against China. These included visits by the Speaker of the US congress among others. However, China has stood firm in frustrating those measures. It continues to work for the re-unification of Taiwan with the mainland in a peaceful manner. It encourages dialogue and has long ago made one of the most creative proposals, that is “One Country, Two Systems”. That has proven to be a viable path. The world is a much safer place because of the work that President Xi Jinping and the Government of China have been pursuing over the years and particularly in 2023. We are certain that 2024 would bring greater successes.

Highway 7, has been a popular spot for years to see the latest films from Hollywood.\nBut that began to change when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n“The Miller Theatres family has enjoyed being part of the community and sharing memories and movies with you and your family,\" the owners said in a Facebook post Wednesday night. \"After Covid, Hollywood has failed to consistently release quality and quantity film product. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult for small independent theatre locations such as ours to survive and thrive in this environment. Therefore, the owners have decided to change direction.\"\nIn the statement on its Facebook page, the Miller family \"thanked Blue Springs and surrounding communities for their support and patronage over the years. We will always hold the love of movies in our hearts.\"\n—",

Scopriamo nel corso di questo nuovo articolo tutti i dettagli sulle decisioni che potrebbe prendere il costruttore francese.\nValeo: previste chiusure e licenziamenti dei lavoratori\nLa crisi del settore automotive colpisce anche il costruttore francese specializzato nella componentistica per la produzione di autoveicoli. Una crisi che sembra non stia risparmiando nessuna realtà, portando di conseguenza a dover prendere drastiche decisioni. Secondo quanto diffuso nelle scorse ore, sembrerebbe che il costruttore sia intenzionato a procedere con la chiusura di due stabilimenti e con il taglio di oltre 1000 posti di lavoro.\nNello specifico, gli impianti che Valeo probabilmente chiuderà sono due e si trovano in Francia, un centro di ricerca e sviluppo e una fabbrica in cui si producono componenti destinati ai veicoli ibridi. Quel che sappiamo è che l’azienda francese potrebbe proporre ai dipendenti di accettare il trasferimento in un centro più grande. Al proposito, non mancano anche alcune indizi sulla possibile dismessa o vendita di uno stabilimento attualmente funzionante nei pressi di Lione. Almeno per il momento, però, non ci sarebbe la volontà di chiuderlo e di licenziare il personale.\nLa situazione è dunque del tutto complessa per tantissimi costruttori automobilistici. Molti, infatti, oltre a Valeo stanno valutando, o hanno già deciso, quali degli stabilimenti attualmente attivi dovranno essere chiusi. Non ci resta che attendere ulteriori aggiornamenti sulla questione, nella speranza che nei prossimi mesi la situazione possa migliorare.",

    "text": "New York Sues Vape Sellers Like Puff Bar for Targeting Kids New York’s top prosecutor is suing Puff Bar and about a dozen other makers and distributors of popular e-cigarette brands for alleged illegal sales practices and marketing products to children. Bloomberg Published 21 Feb 2025, 05:17 AM IST New York Sues Vape Sellers Like Puff Bar for Targeting Kids (Bloomberg) -- New York’s top prosecutor is suing Puff Bar and about a dozen other makers and distributors of popular e-cigarette brands for alleged illegal sales practices and marketing products to children.\nThe lawsuit follows a two-year investigation by Attorney General Letitia James’ office that found the companies’ marketing campaigns targeted underage customers and misled consumers. The state said it is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\n“The vaping industry is taking a page out of Big Tobacco’s playbook: they’re making nicotine seem cool, getting kids hooked, and creating a massive public crisis in the process,” James said in a statement. The suit charges the companies with alleged civil fraud and public nuisance claims, echoing landmark litigation against tobacco firms in the 1990s.\nThe suit is the latest salvo in a prolonged fight over e-cigarette makers’ alleged targeting of young people with products featuring child-friendly fruity flavors and cartoonish names. While vapes are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, many unauthorized products continue to be sold because of weak enforcement and a flourishing black market.\nThe New York suit alleges that companies such as Puff Bar and MYLE Vape violated laws including the state’s 2020 ban of flavored vape products and the federal Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act that restricts shipping and distribution. In addition to damages, the state is seeking to set up a fund that will help alleviate vaping-related public health problems.\nThe companies allegedly targeted young people with bright, colorful packaging and candy and fruit flavors such as “OMG Blow Pop” and “Strawberry Donut.” They also pushed unproven claims that their products are safe alternatives to cigarettes, according to the state’s claim.\nPuff Bar and MYLE Vape did not immediately return requests for comment.\nPuff Bar ran social media ads during the early days of the Covid lockdown that described their vapes as “the perfect escape from the back-to-back Zoom calls [and] parental texts,” the lawsuit said. Puff Bar also marketed their products using viral social media trends, including the “Puff Bar challenge,” the lawsuit said, citing one social media post in which a participant appeared to be inhaling from 15 of the disposable vapes at the same time.\nThe legal efforts are part of a broader crackdown on illegal sales and distribution of vape products in recent years, with other players including health regulators and partners in law enforcement. A previous lawsuit filed by New York and other states against Juul Labs Inc. over the company’s alleged targeting of teenagers was settled in 2023 for $462 million.\nThe actions may be helping, with US teenagers’ vape use dropping by roughly two-thirds over the past five years, according to results from a National Youth Tobacco Survey of middle and high school students released in September. About 1.6 million school children reported using the devices in 2024, compared with more than 5 million in 2019.\n(Updates with requests for company comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "text": "With Chesapeake Bay oyster recovery at a crucial point, building on current momentum will increase resiliency to climate change in the region while creating multiple benefits for people and the environment, according to a new report released today by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. Recommendations in the report, titled “Hope on the Half Shell: Harnessing Oysters to Build Ecological and Community Resilience,” include targeting oyster restoration in 20 additional Bay rivers, equitably growing the oyster aquaculture industry and modernizing management of the wild oyster harvest. “Oysters are the bedrock of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, long recognized for their ability to provide habitat and improve water quality. But their benefits to communities and the ecosystem extend far beyond that,” said CBF Maryland Executive Director Allison Colden. “Oysters are key to adapting to climate change, supporting local economies and cleaning up waterways. You can’t overstate their importance to the Bay.” But oysters are at a critical juncture. Over the last century, Chesapeake Bay oyster numbers plummeted to just a fraction of historic levels due to disease, overharvesting, pollution and habitat loss, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The decline of oysters and their habitat has exacerbated water quality issues, reduced productivity of key Bay fisheries and left critical shoreline habitats like marshes and underwater grasses susceptible to erosion and loss. Now, the Chesapeake Bay is home to some of the most successful oyster restoration projects in the world. Under the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, federal-state efforts are on track to fully restore 11 Chesapeake Bay tributaries for oyster habitat by 2025. Monitoring of these restored reefs shows most reefs sustaining or expanding while meeting or exceeding criteria for oyster abundance. “Restoring native oyster habitat and populations in ten tributaries is one of the few material outcomes set by the Chesapeake Watershed Agreement that will actually be achieved by 2025,” said Don Boesch, president emeritus of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. “But this is just the beginning, not the end, for recovery of the Bay’s oyster population.” Large-scale oyster restoration achievements have been possible through strong federal investment, state support, and the collaboration of many partners. As this major phase nears completion, sustained federal funding and state support will be crucial, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation said in a press release. “With all the elements for success now in place, it’s time to seize the moment and accelerate the pace and scale of oyster recovery in Chesapeake Bay,” Colden said. Oysters can play an important role in protecting Chesapeake Bay shorelines and marshes from erosion, sea-level rise and intense storms. As momentum, funding and expertise coalesces around oysters, recommendations in the report for immediate next steps include: - Accelerate the pace and scale of large-scale oyster restoration projects, restoring an additional 20 Bay tributaries by 2035 that collectively encompass 4,000 acres or more of restored oyster reef. - Grow Maryland’s oyster aquaculture industry to 50,000 acres under lease and 500,000 bushels harvested annually by 2035. That compares to 7,500 acres under lease and 94,000 bushels harvested for Maryland oyster aquaculture in 2022. - In Virginia, initiate an oyster stock assessment, ensure aquaculture growth in all regions and ensure that oyster aquaculture leases are effectively utilized. - Increase the use of oysters in shoreline protection and restoration to address sea-level rise and erosion from more intense storms due to climate change. - Modernize oyster fishery management to increase oyster numbers. That includes utilizing the most up-to-date scientific information and methods, implementing harvest quotas and using electronic harvest reporting. - Manage oyster shell to grow this critical resource for oyster restoration, as well as oyster replenishment work to support oyster fisheries. The report recommendations aim to achieve six vital outcomes for Maryland and Virginia, which are: - Improved water quality; - Equitable economic opportunities for coastal communities; - Increased resilience to sea-level rise and storm surge; - Climate change mitigation; - Transparency and accountability in fishery management; and, - Modernized fishery management for sustainable harvests. Oysters create significant economic benefits for Bay states. Sales of oysters brought in more than $56.8 million in revenue in Maryland and Virginia in 2022, and restoration reefs support millions more in revenue for other fisheries by providing key habitat for game fish and blue crabs. This comes alongside the growing recognition that coastal restoration efforts in the face of climate change must be undertaken holistically. For example, for the greatest benefits, new oyster reefs can be built in conjunction with underwater grasses, living shorelines and buffers of native trees and shrubs. In addition, oyster restoration efforts take place in shallow water, an area where the recent Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response report indicated Chesapeake Bay restoration partners should focus near-term restoration efforts. “Increasing oyster numbers benefits all facets of life in and along the Chesapeake,” said Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director Chris Moore. “Now let’s expand on the achievements to date. With oysters, we can adapt to climate change, support the Bay’s ecological, economic, and social resilience, and build vibrant communities where people and nature thrive together.” Bill Walton, who is the Shellfish Aquaculture Program coordinator for the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, noted the importance of expanding aquaculture. “It’s exciting to see a restoration plan for Chesapeake Bay that embraces shellfish aquaculture as part of the solution. While many might think of the economic benefits of shellfish aquaculture and how those rely on a healthy Bay, the science is clear that shellfish aquaculture can provide environmental benefits,” Walton said. “As the report notes, reaching the ambitious environmental goals will require the diversity of people who care about Chesapeake Bay to work together creatively to achieve those outcomes.” Boesch also expressed support for the report’s recommendations. “We must build on what we have learned to take the next steps recommended in this report by CBF,” Boesch said. “While bold, these recommendations are entirely feasible and achieving them will provide manifold benefits for society, ecosystem health and climate resilience.”",
