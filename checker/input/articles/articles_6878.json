    "title": "Miami pharmacist’s trafficking case casts spotlight on ‘horrific’ child sex tourism in Colombia",
    "text": "MIAMI – Experts say the arrest of a Miami pharmacist is bringing new attention to the prevalence of child sex tourism in Colombia. Authorities said just as Stefan Andres Correa stepped onto a Miami International Airport jet bridge to board a flight to Bogotá Friday, an outbound border search revealed the 42-year-old — traveling alone — was carrying about nine cellphones. Recommended Videos On some of those devices, federal agents would discover photos and videos of Correa raping young girls and a conversation with a sex trafficker about his plans to victimize an 11-year-old girl, prosecutors allege. Court documents state that in a graphic series of text messages, Correa promised that both the trafficker and the girl would get $300,000 Colombian pesos — about $75 — and the girl would receive an iPhone, as long as he was allowed to rape her in Medellín. He had similar conversations and made similar promises about another girl of similar age, prosecutors allege. “I don’t want her to say ‘no,’” they allege Correa texted the trafficker in Spanish, later telling him, “Please don’t interrupt, no matter what happens, OK?” Investigators said Correa told them he flew to Colombia on numerous occasions to sexually abuse children. Prosecutors said that records show he traveled to Colombia roughly 45 times since 2022. Medellín’s mayor sounded off on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after the arrest, posting in part: “These abuses against our children have been occurring with great intensity for years. We are not going to rest in this fight that has only just begun.” Mayor Fico Gutiérrez added the English hashtag “#Don’tEvenTryIt.” “Unfortunately since the ‘Cocaine Cowboy’ days back in the 80s there has been a war on children and that has led to the sexual exploitation of children,” attorney Kristen Reynoso Jackwin, who has represented clients in federal investigations, told Local 10 News. “It is children as young as 12 years old and they are finding U.S. citizens with children in hotel rooms and it is horrific.” Gutiérrez recently announced new measures to combat child sex tourism, including seizing properties from owners that allow the sexual exploitation of minors. Jackwin said while she commends the mayor, more needs to be done. “Because simply shutting them down, there are always other ways that they can open up new locations to continue to do this exploitation of children,” she said. Jackwin said prosecuting cases is not the only objective outlined in a partnership between the U.S. and Colombia, signed two years ago, but explained it is key to robustly combatting child sex tourism. That partnership is called the U.S. – Colombia Child Protection Compact . The U.S. Embassy in Colombia has promoted joint measures with officials in the country to combat sex trafficking. Medellín: The sinister side of an increase in global tourism Local 10 News spoke with an expert to explain why Medellín has developed a reputation for child sex trafficking. Larry Gumbiner, a retired U.S. diplomat who spent two stints at America’s embassy in Bogotá, said Colombia is “opening up to the world and, with that, you are seeing a lot of the underbelly of international tourism, which is the international sex tourist trade.” Gumbiner now works at consulting firm WestExec Advisors as its senior advisor for Latin America and the Caribbean. He said Colombia went through decades of low tourism owing to internal conflict between the country and guerilla groups. Gumbiner said when that finally calmed down, “it kind of opened up a whole new country that had not been available to many tourists.” “So you began to see, particularly in Medellín which was the epicenter of Pablo Escobar’s fiefdom — and it was a dangerous place to be for many years — finally became opened up to the world,” he said. As the city has cleaned up its image, cracking down on the drug trade to attract tourists, with that has come child sex tourists, Gumbiner said. “It is a wonderful city, lots of attractions, great weather, attracting tourists and along with that, what we have seen, prostitution is legal in Colombia for adults, but prostitution among minors began to explode and with it developed a reputation as a place you can go, because it’s inexpensive for Americans,” he said. Gumbiner added that Gutiérrez is likely weighing in on the issue now because the recent high profile arrests of U.S. citizens there has catapulted the issue into the court of public opinion. “This has been building for many years in terms of Medellin and the growth of this industry,” Gumbiner said. “It built into a crescendo when they found an American citizen with two underage girls in his hotel room. I think, finally, for the political system, it reached a breaking point where the mayor felt he had to do something.” As for Correa’s case, the pharmacist, facing federal charges of attempted sex trafficking of a minor and attempted travel to engage in illicit sex conduct, is scheduled to appear in Miami federal court Friday for a detention hearing. If found guilty, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison with a maximum sentence of life in prison, as well as up to a lifetime of supervised release.",

    "title": "The years 2023 and 2024 have exceeded 1.5 degrees of warming",
    "text": "The last two years have exceeded on average the limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming set by the [Paris](/tag/Paris) agreement, the European Copernicus observatory announced on Friday. They show a continuous and unprecedented rise in temperatures in modern history.\nAs expected for months, and now confirmed by all temperatures up to December 31, 2024 was indeed the hottest year ever recorded since statistics began in 1850, the climate change service confirmed ( C3S) of Copernicus.\n2025 is not expected to be a record year, but the British Meteorological Office has warned that the year is expected to be one of the three hottest recorded on the planet. Countries are due to announce their new climate roadmaps this year, updated every five years as part of the Paris climate agreement.\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases is stalling in certain rich countries, notably in the United States, where Donald Trump is due to return to the presidency and where a drop of only -0.2% was recorded last year , according to an independent report.\nUnpublished for 120,000 years\nAccording to Copernicus, the year 2024 alone but also the average of the two years 2023-2024 exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to the pre-industrial era, before the massive use of coal, oil and gas fossil does not profoundly modify the climate. This does not mean, however, that the most ambitious limit of the Paris agreement – observed over at least 20 years – has been crossed, recalls Copernicus.\nBut ‘it underscores the fact that global temperatures are rising beyond what modern humans have experienced.’ Indeed, the current warming of the climate has not been seen for at least 120,000 years, according to scientists. This is a ‘serious warning’, judges Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).\n‘We have had a taste of a 1.5 degree world, with unprecedented suffering and economic costs for people and the global economy, due to human-enhanced extreme events like droughts, floods, fires and storms,’ he told AFP.\nOverheating oceans\nEconomically, natural disasters caused $320 billion in losses worldwide last year, according to reinsurer Munich Re.\nContaining warming to 1.5 degrees rather than 2 degrees – the upper limit of the Paris agreement – would significantly limit its most catastrophic consequences, according to the IPCC, the climate experts mandated by the UN.\n‘Every year of the last decade has been one of the ten hottest on record,’ warns Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S at Copernicus.\nThe oceans, which absorb 90% of the excess heat caused by humanity, also continued to overheat. The annual average of their surface temperatures – excluding polar zones – reached the unprecedented level of 20.87 degrees, beating the 2023 record.\nIn addition to the immediate impacts of marine heatwaves on corals or fish, this lasting overheating of the oceans, the main regulator of the earth’s climate, affects marine and atmospheric currents.\n‘In our hands’\nWarmer seas release more water vapor into the atmosphere, providing additional energy for typhoons, hurricanes or storms. Copernicus reports that the level of water vapor in the atmosphere has reached a record level in 2024, standing around 5% above the 1991-2020 average.\nHowever, the past year saw the end of the natural El Niño phenomenon, which induces global warming and an increase in certain extreme events, and a transition towards neutral conditions or the opposite phenomenon, La Niña.\nThe World Meteorological Organization already warned in December that the latter would be ‘short and of low intensity’ and insufficient to offset the effects of warming.\n‘The future is in our hands. Rapid and decisive action can still deviate the trajectory of our future climate, stresses the director of Copernicus’ climate change department, Carlo Buontempo.\n/ATS",

    "text": "04/04/2024 - 18:04 O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva disse nesta quinta-feira, 5, que o Brasil tem condições de ter uma indústria de saúde competitiva e que o SUS seria fundamental para o desenvolvimento do setor. Ele deu a declaração em Goiana (PE), em inauguração de fábrica da Hemobrás. “Queremos um país soberano, capaz de ter uma indústria da saúde, porque nós temos o órgão consumidor que é o SUS. Que pode comprar as máquinas que a gente produzir, os remédios que a gente produzir, as vacinas. A gente não tem por que não acreditar que a gente pode ter um polo industrial na área da saúde para competir com qualquer outro país do mundo”, declarou o presidente da República. Além disso, Lula voltou a falar sobre inteligência artificial. Disse, dirigindo-se à ministra da Ciência e Tecnologia, Luciana Santos, que quer ver um projeto brasileiro para o setor até junho. O petista afirmou ter dado a seguinte declaração em uma reunião com a ministra e cientistas: “Vamos criar vergonha, vamos ter uma Conferência Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em junho, e até junho vocês estão desafiados a me apresentar um projeto brasileiro de inteligência artificial para a gente não ter que copiar de outro país as coisas importantes que nós precisamos.”",

    "title": "How Alabama guard Aaron Estrada has found his role this season",
    "text": "Being a new face on an SEC roster is no easy task, not even for a two-time conference player of the year in the Coastal Athletic Association.\nFor Aaron Estrada, however, he has had no trouble in finding his role with the Crimson Tide this season after 13 games.\nPreviously a 20 points per game scorer at Hofstra, Estrada was the primary scorer and ball handler at his former school. Adjusting to a lineup with equally talented scorers such as Mark Sears and Grant Nelson this year, Estrada has had to learn to play a different style.\n“As you guys know I was just pretty much a scorer at Hofstra for the last two years,” Estrada said on Friday. “Here, that’s not necessarily the case. I feel like I’m just making winning plays at this point, and it doesn’t have to necessarily end with a shot every time.”\nRight now, Estrada is averaging 13.8 points per game, 4.8 rebounds per game, and 4.1 assists per game. The veteran guard is a well-rounded playmaker on a roster that is full of scorers from everywhere on the floor.\nComing off of his best game yet, Estrada nearly finished with a triple-double against the Liberty Flames. Having 13 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists, the New Jersey native has seen tremendous progression in his game this season.\n“I’m starting to get the hang of not having to shoot as much as I did,” Estrada said after the Liberty game. “Just being able to pass to Grant, or Mark, or Latrell when he’s hitting. Assists really come easy because these guys are making shots too.”\nEarly in the season, Estrada dominated the backcourt in scoring with Sears as he put up over 20 points in three of the first six games of the season. Now, he has fallen into a role where he primarily passes and rebounds, while still being able to score when needed.\nIn his last three games, Estrada has combined for 19 rebounds and 22 assists, along with averaging 12 points per game during that stretch as well.\n“I think he’s starting to figure out where to attack, where to get the assist, how to plan with these guys a little more,” head coach Nate Oats said. “I think he’s figuring a lot of other things out. I think he’s a guy that hopefully we can get him a triple-double this year with the amount of shooting players he has around him.”\nEstrada finding his role as a dominant playmaker comes just in time for conference play for the Crimson Tide. As the competition gets tougher and the games become more meaningful, look for one of Alabama’s most consistent players to play a significant role in the coming weeks.\n“I think his overall game, playmaking, defense, rebounding, all of it, I think he’s playing his best basketball of the year so far,” Oats said.\nAfter a short holiday break, Alabama will open up conference play on the road in Nashville against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Jan. 6 at 2:30 p.m. CT.\ntrending {{ article.title }} premium-icon\n{{ timeAgo(article.live_at) }}",

    "text": "Residents in parts of Queensland smashed by multiple extreme weather events have been warned it will take time to recover.\nThe state was hit by flooding, tornado-like winds and rain that claimed the lives of seven people in the days after Christmas.\nTens of thousands of homes around the Gold Coast have also endured four days without power as heatwave conditions built.\nFederal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said some suburbs’ power networks had been “completely smashed”.\n“The scale of the damage we’ve seen across a pretty big part of southeast Queensland is very large and therefore is going to take some time to work through,” Senator Watt said.\nEmergency services have been stretched by flooding in Cairns and far north Queensland followed immediately by storms in the southeast.\nSome suburbs’ power networks have been “completely smashed”, federal minister Murray Watt says. (JASON O’BRIEN/AAP PHOTOS)\n“When you’re dealing with disasters from one end of the state to the other, literally, that is a real test for people and there’s incredible work being put in,” Senator Watt said.\nPort Douglas residents and businesses were told to stop using water immediately on Friday after a landslide halted operations at a treatment plant.\nDouglas Shire Council has organised collection points for bottled drinking water with a limit of two litres per person and trucks will supply non-potable water at Port Douglas Community Hall and Mossman State High School.\nActing Inspector Nick Sellars said police were attending 22 road intersections where power had been cut to traffic lights, including near the Gold Coast’s major theme parks.\nDisaster Recovery Minister Nikki Boyd said five homes had been destroyed across the Gold Coast, Logan and Scenic Rim regions and 27,400 customers were without power.\nMs Boyd said 90 per cent of homes and businesses should have their power restored by New Year’s Eve and 80 SES workers were en route to assist.\nFederal Nationals leader David Littleproud warned Australia was only at the start of the disaster season, casting doubt on the accuracy of weather warnings.\n“We’ve got a lot of recovery to do in fixing a lot of roads, a lot of infrastructure and helping farmers out who have lost a lot of produce,” he said.\n“If they haven’t provided the right warnings with the right information at the right time, then questions should be asked.”\nGovernment Services Minister Bill Shorten said the bureau faced unpredictable circumstances in tracking Cyclone Jasper in far north Queensland.\n“The Bureau of Meteorology does, on balance, a pretty good job,” he said.\n“But this was just an extraordinary set of circumstances and now the focus has got to be helping people.”\nTemperatures are expected to soar across most of northern Australia.\nParts of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face extreme to severe heatwave conditions.\nMarble Bar in WA’s Pilbara region may reach 49C on Saturday and temperatures up to 45C are expected there for six days.\nIn the Northern Territory, it’s predicted to reach 40C in Katherine and 43C in Tennant Creek, and warm minimums in Darwin are likely to make for uncomfortable nights.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43C, while up to 37C is forecast for Gympie in the storm-ravaged southeast.\nHighs of up to 36C are predicted in Brisbane, while Longreach in the state’s west is forecast to get to 47C.\nPeople in the worst impacted areas have been urged to stay indoors, close windows and blinds to keep heat out of homes and seek out fans or air-conditioners.",
