    "title": "“Trophyless again this season” – Fans MOCK Tottenham Hotspur as Brighton secure dominant 4-2 victory",
    "text": "Tottenham Hotspur started their season with a bang under new coach Ange Postecoglou. Despite losing Harry Kane to Bayern Munich, They topped the table but after a string of injuries and suspensions, there was a massive drop in form. From being at the top at Game Week 10, they dropped down to 4th.\nNow they face\nBrighton and Hove Albion at the AmEx Stadium. Looking to get back into the title race, Spurs aimed for a win. The hosts meanwhile needed to take a step closer to the top 6. With the two teams playing great football, many expected a good game to spectate, but it ended up being a one-sided affair.\nTottenham were completely dominated by the hosts, who slotted four goals past Guglielmo Vicario. The scoring was opened by Josh Hinshewood in the 11th minute. Just 13 minutes later, Dejan Kulusevski pulled Danny Welbeck’s shirt in the box, which didn’t allow him to take a shot. After consulting VAR, a penalty was awarded and Joao Pedro made it 2-0.\nPervis Estupinian scored a screamer from outside the box after a corner to put Brighton 3-0 up in the 63rd minute. 12 minutes later Giovani Lo Celso conceded another penalty, which Pedro once again converted. In the last 15 minutes it looked like Spurs might’ve equalized as they managed to score two goals. Alejo Veliz and Ben Devis scored in the 81st and 85th minute, but Spurs were unable to find the back of the net.\n“Bottle Job FC is Back” – Mesut Ozil’s HILARIOUS tweet to banter Tottenham leaves internet in stitches\nFans banter Tottenham as they drop out of the top 4\nWith 4 goals conceded, Tottenham Hotspur were subjected to banter by fans. Many joked how they were going to go trophyless for the 15th season in a row, something the club was used to. Others criticized their poor performance, with captain Hueng-min Son being one of the players with a poor performance.\nCheck out some of the fans’ reactions:\nWith this loss,\nSpurs have dropped down to 5th. From being at the top, the team has collapsed due to injuries. Brighton on the other hand are now 8th, just a point behind Manchester United. Spurs will now play AFC Bournemouth, who have had a 7-game unbeaten run, while Brighton face West Ham.\nIn case you missed:\nWATCH: Real Betis officially extends Isco’s contract with HILARIOUS Ali G video “Coming for the Ballon d’Or” – Fans react to Jude Bellingham’s yet another award as he is CROWNED the best U-20 player by IFFHS Syed Talib Haider",

    "text": "A swathe of weather watches and warnings in place tonight for north and west of New Zealand Music festival, sports cancelled as thunderstorms forecast Campers, hikers and drivers warned of flooded rivers and slips Brief respite on Saturday before weather packs in again for New Year’s Eve Almost a full day of rain is likely for parts of New Zealand today and tonight, with the upper North Island and the west of the South Island in for heavy rain through to tomorrow.\nHikers, campers and New Year’s Eve revellers are being warned to take care as thunderstorms, slips and flooding - including flooded rivers - are possible in the worst-hit areas.\nA warm, moist northwesterly flow is bringing rain or showers to all parts of the country, with thunderstorms possible in northern and western parts of both islands and the Deep South.\nFlood risk north of Auckland This afternoon MetService added heavy rain watches for Northland, Coromandel and Auckland , where rain has already been bucketing down since lunchtime. Those regions are now set for periods of heavy rain with possible thunderstorms.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. Rain levels could approach or even exceed warning criteria in localised areas, the forecaster warned. Downpours of 25-40mm per hour were possible.\nThunderstorms and “very heavy, slow moving rain” meant there was a risk of pockets of flooding around the Northland-Auckland boundary this afternoon, according to forecaster Weatherwatch.co.nz .\nA music festival in northwest Auckland has been cancelled at the last minute as thunder and lightning approach. The Love Your Ways festival in Kumeū, featuring Basement Jaxx, was deemed “unsafe to proceed” by the venue. All ticketholders would be refunded, the organisers said.\nNumerous sports matches around the country have also been cancelled including across Taranaki which has been hammered by torrential rain today.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. Weather warnings, watches covering north and west of country MetService last night put weather watches and warnings in place from Waikato and Bay of Plenty down to Fiordland, with 100-160mm of rain possible in some warning areas.\nThe west of the South Island is bearing the brunt of the bad weather , along with Taranaki, which has been hit by torrential rain since this morning.\nA heavy rain warning is in place for Taranaki Maunga through till 3am with a peak of 15-25 mm/h expected until mid-afternoon today.\nThe Westland ranges are under a 21-hour heavy rain warning until 6am Saturday, with 100-140 mm of rain expected over that time and peak rates of 20-30mm/h. Nelson has a heavy rain warning until 7pm tonight with up to 90mm of rain in total.\n🌧️🟠 Severe Weather Warnings\nHeavy rain continues to feed into the west of New Zealand today, along with the risk of thunderstorms.\nHeavy rain warnings for the ranges of Westland, areas west of Motueka and Taranaki Maunga. pic.twitter.com/4ZvhdwEOkc\n— MetService (@MetService) December 28, 2023 Heavy rain watches lasting 22 hours are in place for Buller, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō, Tongariro National Park and the Kaimanawa Mountains, while Fiordland’s watch lasts for 20 hours.\nIn the Bay of Plenty including Rotorua a heavy rain watch is in place till 10am Saturday.\nRainfall amounts could reach warning criteria in all those areas, with thunderstorms also possible in many areas.\nHeavy rain means streams and rivers can rise rapidly and driving conditions may be hazardous, with possible surface flooding and slips. Thunderstorms are also possible in many areas, bringing intense localised downpours, according to MetService.\nThe national forecaster’s meteorologist John Law said those thinking of going camping should keep an eye on the forecasts to avoid being stranded by sudden floods or slips.\nWith heavy rain also expected across the Tararua Ranges and the Tongariro Crossing, keen hikers should also take care, Law said.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. New Year’s Day to bring drier weather for 2024 The fast-moving weather system should improve by mid-Saturday but another front will bring more rain on Sunday, MetService says.\nBut there’s good news as 2024 dawns - both MetService and private forecaster WeatherWatch expect the weather to clear for New Year’s Day.\nWeatherWatch head forecaster Philip Duncan said a big block of high pressure coming in from the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean will bring clearing, cooler weather on January 1, with the recent high humidity taking a break.\n📺⛺️🥳Last weather #video of 2023: #NewZealand 10 day outlook as January 2024 arrives ... https://t.co/24z3vntqfH\n— WeatherWatch.co.nz (@WeatherWatchNZ) December 28, 2023",

Об этом пишут РИА «Новости» со ссылкой на данные сервиса Headhunter.\n«Чаще всего в первом полугодии 2025 года работодатели искали продавцов-кассиров и продавцов консультантов — 358 тыс. вакансий. На втором месте — менеджеры по продажам и работе с клиентами. Компании разместили более 348,5 тыс. предложений для таких специалистов», — говорится в исследовании.\nВ пятерку также попали: водители — для них появилось почти 157 тыс. вакансий; операторы call-центров (153 тыс. вакансий); бухгалтеры (140,8 тыс. предложений). Топ-10 дефицитных специальностей замыкают: разнорабочий, врач, электромонтажник, кладовщик, слесарь и другие специалисты.\nMicrosoft недавно составил список из 40 профессий, которые могут исчезнуть и измениться из‑за нейросетей в ближайшее 3-8 лет. Первое место в нем занимают переводчики. Затем — писатели, продавцы, редакторы, хосты, консьержи, веб-разработчики, операторы кол-центров, брокерские клерки.",

    "text": "The Birmingham Youth & Young Adult Fellowship Choir earns Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer—now on stage July 20 in Birmingham.\nBy SPEAKIN’ OUT NEWS\nChoir director Ahkeem Lee celebrates with the group after Simon Cowell hit the Golden Buzzer on AGT. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The Birmingham Youth & Young Adult Fellowship Choir has earned the hearts of America’s Got Talent judges, receiving the coveted Golden Buzzer from Simon Cowell after a soul-stirring rendition of “Joyful, Joyful, Lord We Adore Thee.”\n“I could see and hear how much work went into this,” Cowell said before pressing the buzzer, adding, “Every single one of you played the perfect part… I’m so honored you came here on our 20th anniversary”.\nThe 10-year-old choir—founded in 2015 as a back-to-school fundraiser—took their talents to Pasadena, California for the AGT auditions. Their choreographed rendition of the hymn, infused with emotional gospel energy, earned them a standing ovation from all judges.\nChoir director Ahkeem Lee reflected on the moment:\n“Going on stage, I actually felt a sense of relief… I’ll never forget how blown away I was by the choir’s performance that night.”\nThe choir’s local impact continues: their 10th Anniversary Celebration concert and benefit is scheduled for Sunday, July 20, at 3:30 p.m. at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Like their first concert, it aims to support local students by distributing free school supplies.\nThis is a rare opportunity to see the choir live—don’t miss this inspiring homecoming performance!",

    "text": "Sofia Ribeiro resolveu falar sobre a 'trend' das redes socias, onde as pessoas partilham fotos dos momentos felizes vividos este ano com a premissa: \"Como vou ver triste se em 2024 eu...\".\nA atriz deixou a seguinte reflexão aos seguidores: \"Como vou ser triste se fingimos ser felizes o ano todo? Não deveria ser mais assim?\"\nAo longo do texto, a atriz refere: \"É possível e saudável celebrar, mas também acolher a dor. Sentir tristeza no meio das conquistas não invalida tudo de bom que aconteceu.\"\nSofia sentiu necessidade de dar o seu exemplo num longo desabafo: \"Este ano foi para mim, um dos mais felizes e também um dos mais desafiadores. [...] Dores novas surgiram. [...] Viver a tristeza da mesma maneira que vivemos a alegria, é um ato de coragem.\"\n\"Sou muito mais alegre do que triste, mas também sou feita dos meus fracassos, das minhas angústias, anseios. [...] A vida real, quotidiana, não é na maioria do tempo feliz, ou é? Estiveste triste? Eu estive. Tive dias triste, angustiada, inquieta\", confessou a atriz.\n\"Não é humano estar feliz o tempo todo, o ano todo. E aceitar isso é libertador e, para mim, essa foi uma grande conquista deste ano\", terminou.\nLeia Também: [Ruben Rua: \"A Sofia foi a minha primeira namorada.
