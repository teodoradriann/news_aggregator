    "title": "Onir on his queer film Pine Cone's screening at BFI Flare film festival: I hope this creates interest back home",
    "text": "Director Onir is elated that his movie Pine Cone is getting screened at the British Film Institute Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival. \"I'm very happy because it is a celebrated festival that has specially curated films which people talk about,\" Onir shares with us after the announcement.\nBFI Flare is one of the world's most significant queer film events. Onir revealed that soon after the ticket sales opened for the two-day screening of his film, its Day 1 got sold out in no time. \"I just hope this creates interest back home because ultimately it makes my country, my people, our communities proud,\" he adds\nPine Cone is a semi-autobiographical film about a filmmaker exploring his journey over two decades and how the changing landscape of queer rights in India in 1999 makes him cynical about love. The film has already earned accolades at several film festivals.\nThe I Am director stated that despite Pine Cone being a queer centric film from India, it'll connect globally because the core of the community remains the same.\n\"Today the global audience is used to watching different kinds of films from across the world. There is a space where you're loved. It's not just for people from the [queer] community, but also people who love watching good films,\" the 54-year-old filmmaker said.\nOnir has been a pioneer of LGBTQIA+ cinema in India. His film My Brother Nikhil (2005) had Sanjay Suri and Purab Kohli playing a gay couple. The film received several awards and critical acclaim.\nLooking back, Onir recalls how My Brother Nikhil was questioned for being ahead of its time, and shares even Pine Cone is being called one. Taking a jibe, he says, \"In India people are still taking baby steps. And my life, our queer life is not baby steps. Just like me as an audience, as a gay man, can watch any film, even those who aren't queer should be able to watch Pine Cone for its story, the beauty and journey of people.\"\nBut does he feel India still lags behind in bringing same sex stories on the screens, despite the canvas of cinema increasing by the day? He says even if people think queer films have a limited audience, his job is to tell new stories.\n\"Then it's the job of dustributers, exhibitors and platforms to figure out how it reaches out. Sometimes it's a little exhausting trying to negotiate. Making it is always a joy, but finding a theatre, especially in India, is always a trauma. Sometimes I feel the amount of money people spend in buying candles and curtains, I can make a film in that!\"\nWhile Onir has no issues in films being made at a budget of ₹100 crore, he questions \"why can't we put in 10% in films that have been accepted as populist cinema?\" He also opions that \"audience won't change overnight. You need to keep giving them such films so that slowly our back transforms.\"\nOnir holds strongly that his aim is to tell stories of people \"who are made to be invisible. As an industry, it is important to tell all kinds of films.\"\n\"Everytime a queer person thinks of a romantic song, the visuals are around a man and a woman. So I thought let me have a love song [in Pine Cone ] between two men. For me it's just celebrating our lives,\" he signs off.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "text": "Ronald McDonald House celebrates 40 years of serving families across Piedmont Triad and beyond It's a big year for the Ronald McDonald House, as it celebrates 40 years of helping families all across the Piedmont Triad care for their sick children. It's a big year for the Ronald McDonald House, as it celebrates 40 years of helping families all across the Piedmont Triad care for their sick children. It's a big year for the Ronald McDonald House, as it celebrates 40 years of helping families all across the Piedmont Triad care for their sick children. It's a big year for the Ronald McDonald House, as it celebrates 40 years of helping families all across the Piedmont Triad care for their sick children. Over the last four decades, the nonprofit has grown to be able to serve more than double the families it started with in September of 1984. \"We started coming to the Ronald McDonald House in October,\" said Hannah Gibson, who has been in and out of the Ronald McDonald House for several months. Gibson's 18-month-old daughter, Belle, has been dealing with a rare digestive issue that has kept her in and out of the hospital. \"She had been dealing with a lot of weight loss and vomiting,\" Gibson said. \"Not eating, stuff like that.\" Throughout Belle's journey to get better, the Ronald McDonald House has been that one constant that's been by the family's side the entire way. \"They go above and beyond to try to make sure we have everything we need while we are here,\" Gibson said. \"We don't have to stress about getting it.\" As a single mother of two, the Ronald McDonald House provides comfort and a safe place to stay — even nearly 150 miles away from Gibson's home. \"If we didn't have the Ronald McDonald House, I would just be having to pay for hotels and stuff,\" she said. \"And as a single mom, I don't have the means for that.\" \"They've become family to us,\" said Hannah's seven-year-old daughter Hayden. \"Because they're always there when we need them and they're so supportive — like actual family.\" Especially for families who had to spend the holidays there, the Ronald McDonald House does its best to make it feel like a home away from home. \"It seems like everybody just genuinely cares,\" Gibson said. \"And yes, it does feel like a home away from home,\" added her daughter Hayden. What started as a 10-bedroom house in 1984, has now grown to a 36-bedroom house with an occupancy rate of usually around sixty percent. \"And that 40 years has gone by in a blink of an eye,\" said Ronald McDonald House Chief Executive Officer Chuck Kraft. Thursday night, 20 families stayed there. \"I know that a parent would do anything when their child is sick,\" Kraft said. \"And that's our mission — providing a home away from home for families with children receiving medical care in our community.\" While the Ronald McDonald staff members know that none of them can change anything medically, they're always there for families to offer a smile and support during some of the hardest days. \"They are always, like, the best,\" Hayden said. \"They really do everything they can to make it a home away from home,\" Gibson said. \"And it's not a scary room in the hospital like I thought it was going to be — it's an actual house and people here have become like family to us.\" The fundraising theme for the Ronald McDonald House this year is \"40 for 40.\" The organization is looking for 1,000 generous donors to each donate $40 to reach a $40,000 fundraising goal. A gala to celebrate this milestone will be held in September. You can donate to the Ronald McDonald House by [clicking here](https://rmhcpt.org/).

It takes less than 30 minutes to set up and it can pull water from a hydrant, lake or stream.\nThe height allows water to fly about 250 metres, depending on the wind. From far away, it almost looks like rain.\nThe \"rainstream,\" a 30-metre-tall sprinkler system to help fight and prevent wildfires. (CTV Edmonton/Jeremy Thompson)\n“This is so people can come home to their homes if there is a wildfire, or to give them peace of mind that they're safe if these are around,” Hallett said.\nHe’s adamant that with more wildfires burning in Canada each year, and around the world, his rain sprinkler system is needed more than ever.\n“The nice thing about this, it's not just for the fire. It's even before the fire or after the fire … if you could pre-wet things, then basically there's less chance of the fire being started from lightning.”\nEnoch Cree Nation hosted a demonstration of the sprinkler system on Thursday. Councillor Shane Peacock plans to recommend the rainstream to his peers so the nation can be an early adopter.\n“When you see something like this, you want to get out front, and that's what we're trying to do here in Enoch,” Peacock told CTV News Edmonton.\n“We want to help provide and move forward in the right way, to give us all protection.”\nThere’s only one rainstream in operation so far, located on Enoch Cree Nation. The company said it's ramping up production as it takes six months to build one.",

    "text": "Con la ayuda de David Pecker y de su exabogado Michael Cohen, Trump está acusado de la falsificación de registros contables para sufragar una \"trama criminal\", que habría comprado el silencio de la actriz porno Stormy Daniels. El que fuera editor del tabloide estadounidense The National Enquirer, David Pecker, confirmó este jueves en un tribunal de Nueva York su vínculo con el expresidente Donald Trump en 2016 para ocultar \"historias embarazosas\" que pudieran involucrar al político republicano y perjudicar su campaña electoral. \"Quería proteger a mi empresa, a mí mismo y también a Donald Trump\", expresó quien también fuera ejecutivo del conglomerado mediático America Media Inc. y que acude al tribunal como testigo. Con la ayuda de Pecker y de su exabogado Michael Cohen, Trump está acusado de la falsificación de registros contables para sufragar una \"trama criminal\" -según la Fiscalía- que habría comprado el silencio de la actriz porno Stormy Daniels, además del de la modelo Karen McDougal, evitando que salieran a la luz sus supuestas aventuras amorosas con él. El trato (una práctica conocida como 'catch and kil') consistía en adquirir los derechos de estas historias supuestamente para ser publicadas en dicho tabloide, pero con el fin real de dejarlas 'olvidadas' en un cajón. Algo que Pecker reconoció haber hecho en el caso de McDougal, con el pago de 150.000 dólares que luego debían serle reembolsados por la Organización Trump, pero no en el caso de Daniels. \"El jefe (Trump, según Pecker) se va a poner muy nervioso, me dijo Cohen (...) Presupuse que esta preocupación se debía a su impacto en la campaña\", recordó el magnate de los medios, que dijo haberse negado a comprar la exclusiva de la actriz porno porque no quería que esta afectara a \"la reputación\" del tabloide. Decenas de facturas, cheques, cartas o correos electrónicos fueron sacados a colación por la Fiscalía mientras Trump permanecía impasible desde el banquillo de los acusados. Su gesto apenas se agrió en un par de ocasiones. Una de ellas, cuando Pecker rememoró cómo fue la negociación con McDougal quien, según su versión, temía que se filtrara el acuerdo. \"Realmente, no quería convertirse en la nueva Monica Lewinsky\", añadió . Pecker mencionó diferentes llamadas con Trump durante 2016 en las que su ánimo fue variando a medida que medios como The Wall Street Journal o New York Post se enteraron del acuerdo que el expresidente tenía con The National Enquirer. \"Me llamó muy disgustado preguntando cómo había podido pasar y diciendo que pensaba que lo tenía todo bajo control. Esa llamada terminó sin que se despidiese\", detalló el entonces editor. No obstante, Pecker declaró que, pese a que no mantienen contacto desde 2019, aún considera a Trump \"alguien cercano\". \"Sigo considerándolo un amigo\", concretó el testigo. Antes de llegar al tribunal esta mañana, Trump estuvo en un acto de campaña con aproximadamente una treintena de seguidores desde una obra de nueva construcción en Manhattan y definió a Pecker como \"buena gente\". Esta opinión fue considerada por la Fiscalía como una nueva violación de la orden mordaza que pesa sobre el exmandatario y que le impide referirse públicamente, entre otros, sobre testigos, miembros del jurado y trabajadores de la corte.

    "text": "Seeing the Eucharist Through the Eyes of 10 Saints Wise counsel on loving the Blessed Sacrament more. Jesus is present in [the Eucharist](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resource/55058/the-sacrament-of-the-eucharist-catechism-of-the-catholic-church) and the Catholic Church, and many of the Church's saints have encouraged Catholics to prayerfully participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Throughout the centuries, the saints have taught us, through their witness and their writings, the vital importance of the Eucharist in the Christian life. Below, 10 saints offer their wise counsel on loving the Eucharist more: 1. St. Alphonsus Mary Liguori \"Know for certain that the time you spend with devotion before this most divine Sacrament will be the time that will bring you the most good in this life and will console you the most in your death and in eternity. And know that perhaps you will gain more in a quarter of an hour of adoration in the presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament than in all the other spiritual exercises of the day.” 2. St. Francis de Sales “When prayer is united to this divine sacrifice [of the Mass], it becomes so unspeakably efficacious as to cause the soul to overflow, as it were, with heavenly consolations. Here she reclines upon her well-beloved.” 3. St. John Mary Vianney, the Curé of Ars “If we knew the value of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, how much greater effort would we put forth in order to assist at it!” 4. St. Louis Marie Grignion de Monfort Before Communion, “Implore Mary to lend you her heart so that you may receive her Son with her dispositions.\" 5. St. Teresa of Jesus (or of Ávila) “After having received the Lord, since you have the Person Himself present, strive to close the eyes of the body and open those of the soul and look into your heart.” 6. St. John Bosco (Don Bosco) “Dear young people, do we want to be happy and joyful? Let us love Jesus in the Sacrament with all our hearts.\" 7. St. Catherine of Siena “O boundless charity! Just as you gave us yourself, wholly God and wholly man, so you left us all of yourself as food so that while we are pilgrims in this life we might not collapse in our weariness but be strengthened by you, heavenly food.” 8. St. John Paul II “Dear brothers and sisters: We must feel challenged by the needs of so many brothers. We cannot close our hearts to their requests for help. And we cannot forget that ‘man does not live by bread alone.’ We need the ‘living bread come down from heaven.’ This bread is Jesus. Feeding on it means receiving the very life of God, opening ourselves to the logic of love and sharing.” 9. St. Thérèse of Lisieux “I remembered having heard that one obtains all the favors asked for on one’s First Communion Day. This thought consoled me immediately, and though I was only six years old at the time, I said to myself: ‘I will pray for my poor old man [someone she had tried to give alms to] on the day of my First Communion.’” 10. St. Francis of Assisi “When I cannot attend Holy Mass, I adore the Body of Christ with the eyes of the spirit in prayer, the same as I adore him when I see him at Mass.” Originally published in June 2022, this story has been [updated by ACI Prensa](https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/55780/10-santos-te-dan-consejos-para-amar-mas-la-eucaristia), CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

    "text": "Análise do Guardian conclui que empresas de combustíveis fósseis e mineração ganharam US$ 92 bilhões em dinheiro público de estados, com um número crescente de casos apoiados por especuladores financeiros\nEspeculadores financeiros estão investindo em um número crescente de ações judiciais contra governos sobre leis ambientais e outras regulamentações que afetam os lucros, muitas vezes gerando indenizações lucrativas, descobriu o Guardian.\nPor muito tempo, o financiamento de litígios prosperou principalmente no reino de acidentes de carro e reivindicações trabalhistas. “Teve um acidente que não foi sua culpa?” era o slogan do outdoor da indústria, oferecendo-se para financiar processos em troca de uma parte de qualquer pagamento.\nAgora, no entanto, o setor encontrou um campo de atuação muito maior: o financiamento de enormes processos de arbitragem iniciados por empresas contra governos, cujas reivindicações podem chegar a dezenas de bilhões de dólares.\nEsses casos se enquadram em uma área pouco conhecida do direito internacional chamada solução de controvérsias entre investidores e Estados (ISDS), que permite que empresas processem países por ações que prejudicam seus lucros.\nCom os financiadores de litígios não enfrentando riscos de uma reconvenção e possíveis indenizações que agora ultrapassam em média US$ 200 milhões (£ 160 milhões), especialistas jurídicos alertam que o sistema se tornou um “nirvana do jogador” para fundos de hedge e financiadores especializados.\nDentro do setor, o debate está crescendo: defensores do financiamento de terceiros dizem que ele aumenta o acesso à justiça, mas críticos, incluindo árbitros que decidem sobre os casos, estão levantando preocupações de que o crescimento do financiamento de terceiros está alimentando casos caros e potencialmente frívolos, com um custo enorme para o público.\nUma investigação do Guardian, que analisou mais de 1.400 casos iniciados contra governos, descobriu que os casos ISDS se tornaram muito mais comuns e lucrativos. Mais de US$ 120 bilhões de dinheiro público foram concedidos a empresas por meio de tribunais ISDS, incluindo pelo menos US$ 84 bilhões para empresas de combustíveis fósseis e US$ 7,8 bilhões concedidos a empresas de mineração.\nOs números verdadeiros provavelmente são muito maiores, já que as empresas geralmente não divulgam o tamanho dos pagamentos que recebem. O Guardian descobriu que em 31% dos casos em que um pagamento ou acordo foi feito, o tamanho do prêmio não foi divulgado.\nEsses casos se tornaram uma classe de investimento cada vez mais popular para fundos de hedge e outros investidores, que apoiam a ação legal financeiramente em troca de uma parte do prêmio final. O Guardian identificou pelo menos 75 casos ISDS apoiados por terceiros, embora isso também seja provavelmente uma subestimação substancial: muitos tratados não incluem nenhuma obrigação de divulgar o financiamento de terceiros para casos, e o maior órgão de resolução de disputas só começou a exigir divulgação em 2022.\nMetade de todos os casos financiados por terceiros foram iniciados por investidores dos EUA, Grã-Bretanha ou Canadá, e mais de 50% eram casos relacionados a combustíveis fósseis ou mineração. Mais de três quartos dos casos eram contra países em desenvolvimento, de acordo com a análise do Guardian de dados fornecidos pela Jus Mundi, uma plataforma de inteligência jurídica com acesso ao maior banco de dados de direito internacional e arbitragem.\nExemplos de casos financiados por terceiros incluem a empresa bermudense South American Silver, cuja subsidiária adquiriu concessões de mineração em uma área da Bolívia habitada principalmente por comunidades indígenas. Em 2010, a empresa foi acusada de poluir espaços sagrados e ameaçar membros da comunidade, e o governo boliviano revogou as concessões. O governo teve que pagar à empresa de mineração US$ 18,7 milhões em indenização.\nA mina Malku Khota, uma das maiores reservas mundiais de prata, índio e gálio. A South American Silver ganhou milhões em indenização depois que a Bolívia revogou sua concessão em 2012. | TriMetals\nEm outro caso, o governo mexicano está sendo processado por uma empresa de mineração canadense, a Silver Bull, por US$ 408 milhões em danos após não ter dissolvido um bloqueio de mineradores locais protestando. O caso deve começar em outubro.\nEste ano, a Burford Capital – a maior empresa de financiamento de litígios do mundo – está apoiando um caso contra a Groenlândia pelo impacto de uma proibição de mineração de urânio que uma empresa de mineração argumenta que efetivamente encerrou seu desenvolvimento de um dos maiores depósitos de minerais de terras raras do mundo. Se a Groenlândia perder o caso, ela enfrentará ou permitir que a mineração prossiga ou pagar até US$ 11,5 bilhões em indenização.\nPreocupações estão sendo cada vez mais levantadas por aqueles que trabalham no sistema ISDS, incluindo árbitros que julgam casos.\nMuthucumaraswamy Sornarajah, um advogado internacional e árbitro do ISDS, acredita que o financiamento de terceiros transformou o ISDS em um “grande negócio”. Ele disse que era provável que houvesse mais reivindicações sendo apresentadas, porque o risco de perder a reivindicação “desaparece” para o reclamante: “Então isso significaria que os estados respondentes – a maioria dos quais são países em desenvolvimento – teriam que enfrentar o custo de defender reivindicações potencialmente frívolas que são apresentadas com financiamento de terceiros.”\nSornarajah disse que a combinação de honorários advocatícios crescentes e financiamento de terceiros significava que “a extensão do negócio, ou lucros, que podem ser feitos como resultado do ISDS é bastante grande”.\nInternacionalmente, o setor de financiamento de litígios está crescendo, valendo US$ 17,5 bilhões em 2024. Os defensores do financiamento de terceiros geralmente argumentam que sua participação torna o sistema de justiça mais acessível.\nChristopher Bogart, presidente-executivo e cofundador da Burford Capital, a maior provedora de financiamento de litígios do mundo, disse que o financiamento de terceiros desempenhou um papel importante no fornecimento de acesso à justiça, apoiando litigantes que, de outra forma, não teriam condições de arcar com ações legais. A Burford Capital foi a única empresa de financiamento de terceiros que falou com o Guardian. A empresa disse que, em setembro de 2024, 93% dos casos concluídos geraram retorno para os clientes.\n“O financiamento legal fornece uma função de verificação e elimina casos sem mérito: só somos pagos quando nossos clientes ganham seus casos – se os casos que financiamos perderem, perdemos 100% do nosso dinheiro”, disse a empresa em um comunicado.\nBogart acrescentou: “Não acho que o ISDS tenha mais potencial ou seja mais lucrativo do que muitas outras áreas de litígio.”\nO local da mina Kvanefjeld perto de Narsaq. A Groenlândia está sendo processada após ter parado a Energy Transition Minerals de minerar elementos de terras raras e urânio lá. | Patrick Greenfield/Guardian\nMas os críticos alertam que o aumento de casos de terceiros está impulsionando o crescimento de casos especulativos. Lisa Sachs, diretora do Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, disse: “O financiamento de terceiros permite, ou até mesmo encoraja, investidores a buscar reivindicações fora dos balanços dos investidores, removendo um impedimento fundamental para trazer reivindicações fracas ou especulativas.\n“Os financiadores de litígios buscam e investem em casos como uma oportunidade de gerar um retorno sobre seus investimentos, às vezes fazendo parcerias com escritórios de advocacia que têm interesse financeiro em trazer mais reivindicações também. Essa dinâmica incentiva mais arbitragem, independentemente do interesse público mais amplo ou da legitimidade das reivindicações.”\nNo entanto, Burford disse: “Nós sairíamos do mercado se escolhêssemos casos ruins ou frívolos, e a necessidade empresarial exige que sejamos altamente seletivos em nossos investimentos e apoiemos casos vencedores. Nós capacitamos empresas que de outra forma não seriam capazes de buscar justiça.”\nAtualmente, os árbitros não podem penalizar financeiramente financiadores terceirizados forçando-os a cobrir os custos legais de um governo. Mas alguns acham que isso deve mudar. Comentando sobre o caso de Teinver v Argentina, um dos árbitros, Kamal Hossain, disse em uma opinião divergente que “a criação de um ‘Nirvana do jogador’ ao permitir que financiadores terceirizados usem acordos de disputas entre investidores e Estados como um meio de especulação financeira, sem qualquer possibilidade de fazer indenizações de custos contra esses financiadores, é profundamente problemática.”\n“A incapacidade atual dos tribunais de fazer concessões de custos contra financiadores terceirizados é uma questão real e séria, e atraiu a preocupação dos árbitros em casos anteriores”, ele disse. “O envolvimento deles pode aumentar os custos dos procedimentos. Por essa razão, como uma questão de princípio, um tribunal deve ser capaz de fazer uma ordem de custos contra um financiador terceirizado.”\nA Odyssey Marine Exploration, sediada nos EUA, ganhou um pagamento de US$ 37,1 milhões do estado mexicano após ter sido negada uma licença para minerar o leito marinho por motivos ambientais. | Reuters\nEm uma opinião divergente recente sobre o caso da Odyssey Marine Exploration contra o México , o Prof. Philippe Sands, um dos árbitros, destacou os custos “de cair o queixo” que o reclamante havia acumulado, que somavam mais de US$ 21 milhões, metade dos quais foram cobertos por financiamento de terceiros. Os custos dos investidores foram cerca de 10 vezes maiores do que os do governo na defesa da reivindicação.\nEm uma palestra subsequente, Sands levantou a questão mais ampla do financiamento de terceiros no mundo do ISDS, ecoando preocupações sobre o quão custoso o sistema se tornou. “Pode-se dizer que os arranjos ajudam a proporcionar uma espécie de florescimento: mais honorários para os advogados, mais casos para os árbitros e um cocho mais profundo, mais amplo e mais lucrativo no qual todos os nossos focinhos podem ser mergulhados”, disse ele.\nPublicado originalmente pelo The Guardian em 05/03/2025\nPor Patrick Greenfield e Phoebe Weston",

Animado por este éxito, Sears decide dejar su trabajo de la Estación de Trenes y comenzar un negocio de ventas de relojes por correo. Así inicia nuestra historia de éxito en el mundo laboral.\nLa primera tienda de ventas al menudeo se abrió en Chicago. Los siguientes años, continuó creciendo y en la década de los cuarenta, se consolidó como una empresa internacional al iniciar sus operaciones en México, Canadá y Puerto Rico.\nEl 27 de febrero de 1947, Sears abre su primer tienda en la Ciudad de México en la avenida Insurgentes, captando la atención de los clientes con su lema: “La completa satisfacción o la devolución de su dinero”\nEl 28 de abril de 1997, Grupo CARSO compra el 85 por ciento de las acciones en México. Esta nueva etapa contribuyó al desarrollo sostenido de la Empresa, aportando así una nueva filosofía de trabajo.

    "text": "France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on Thursday condemned an increase by Iran in the production rate of highly enriched uranium of up to 60% purity, close to the level used for nuclear weapons fuel.\nIn a joint statement, the allies made no mention of any consequences Iran could face for the production hike but called for its reversal and said they remained \"committed to a diplomatic solution\" of the feud over Tehran's nuclear program Attempting to find a solution\n\"The production of high-enriched uranium by Iran has no credible civilian justification,\" the statement said. \"These decisions ... represent reckless behavior in a tense regional context.\"\nSince the start of Israel's offensive against Gaza's ruling Hamas militants, Iran-backed proxies have increased their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and on US troops in Iraq and Syria, sharply increasing tensions in the region.\nIsrael launched its operation in response to Hamas' October 7 rampage into Israel.\nThe UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a report on Tuesday that Iran had reversed a months-long slowdown in the production rate of highly enriched uranium up to 60% purity.
