Officials identified the man as 61-year-old Charles Timothy Browne. Throughout the investigation, detectives said that Browne sexually assaulted the juvenile within the past year. Browne was arrested on Tuesday, April 23rd. He was charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and statutory sex offense against a child. Browne received a $50,000 bond for the indecent liberties charges and no bond for the statutory sex offense charge. Browne was previously sentenced to 43 months in prison in 2019 for cyberstalking. Officials said he sent over 700 threatening text messages to a female victim. He has also been arrested for trespassing, driving while impaired, and assault on a female.",

    "text": "Juba (Agenzia Fides) – “La scomparsa di p. Luke Yugue e del suo accompagnatore va inserita nel triste contesto delle violenze intercomunitarie tra Azande e Balanda che sono di nuovo esplose dopo il grave conflitto del 2021” dice all’Agenzia Fides suor Elena Balatti, missionaria comboniana in Sud Sudan, facendo riferimento al giovane sacerdote scomparso con il suo accompagnatore, Michael Gbeko il 27 aprile, a Tombura, nello Stato dell'Equatoria occidentale. “Gli Azande sono il gruppo etnico maggioritario nell’Equatoria Occidentale mentre i Balanda sono un gruppo numericamente consistente sempre nella stessa regione ma che hanno una presenza anche nel vicino Stato del Western Bahr el Ghazal” spiega suor Elena. “Dopo anni di pacifica convivenza, nel 2021 sono emerse tensioni politiche, anche in riferimento alla delimitazione dei confini territoriali tra le due tribù; tensioni che sono sfociate in un conflitto sanguinoso, con lo sfollamento di migliaia di persone. Il conflitto si è in seguito calmato ma non è del tutto sedato, e da febbraio/marzo di quest’anno, le Nazioni Unite avevano notato un riacuirsi delle tensioni che hanno provocato, purtroppo, l’uccisione di alcune persone, nuovi sfollamenti e nuove violenze, che sono state contenute in parte dai militari” riferisce la missionaria. “La scomparsa di p. Luke si inserisce quindi in questo contesto di odio e violenza” asserisce suor Elena. “P. Luke di etnia Azande, è scomparso il 27 aprile in una zona a prevalenza etnica Balanda, dove svolgeva il suo ministero. Fin dall’inizio c’erano state illazioni sull’uccisione del sacerdote e del suo autista. Però Mons. Edward Hiiboro Kussala, Vescovo di Tombura-Yambio, aveva chiesto ai fedeli di pregare incessantemente per il ritorno dei due, e a quanto pare, ora che il Vescovo ha annunciato una preghiera funebre per entrambi (vedi Fides 23/5/2024), probabilmente ha avuto la conferma di quello che già avevano riportato alcuni media locali, che si è trattato di un duplice omicidio” dice la missionaria. Suor Elena conclude chiedendo “di pregare perché questo conflitto interetnico, che viene strumentalizzato dai politici, (in Sud Sudan siamo in un periodo preelettorale), non si rinnovi con le proporzioni delle violenza del 2021”.
