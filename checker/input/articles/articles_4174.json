    "title": "Uber, Travelstart Reiterate Commitment to Improve Drivers’ Earnings - THISDAYLIVE",
    "text": "Oluchi Chibuzor Uber and Travelstarts have reiterated their commitments to ensure that drivers continue to improve earning and more discount inview of the economic challenges facing the economy. Speaking at Uber Driver Appreciation event in Lagos, the Country Manager, Uber, Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, said, the company recognise that drivers have faced hurdles this year due to the economic challenges. He also said their resilience and dedication have been exceptional, adding drivers have remained committed to providing reliable service, particularly during these challenging times. At the event which saw some drivers being rewarded with different prizes, Akinwumi, said that Uber remained steadfast in its commitment to providing drivers with sustainable earning opportunities and has significantly invested in key safety measures. According to him, “As we approach the end of this year, Uber remains committed to supporting the drivers who operate on the App, enhancing safety measures, and fostering an environment where excellence thrives. We look forward to continuing this journey together into the new year. “A lot of macro-economic challenges that we had, fuel crisis are going up by almost 200 percent. FX issues, inflation even with that we have seen growth because people need to move, parcels need to move from one point to the other. Our fingers crossed that next year will be a much better year, we will keep innovating and finding cheaper ways for people to move around.” However, for the Country Manager, Travelstart Nigeria, Bukky Akomolafe, “The ultimate reward is seeing drivers and riders winning flights, enjoying ride discounts, and feeling celebrated. The dedication of Nigerians is what fuels our partnership with Uber, and we will keep seeking ways to create cost savings and ease for our country’s travelers. Stay tuned, we will be announcing another engagement soon.”",

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. People are also reading… Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "Throughout its run to winning both the final Pac-12 regular-season and conference tournament titles, Arizona players and coaches raved about how close the team was and how well everyone got along. This could easily be dismissed as hyperbole, but then the offseason came and none of the core players entered the NCAA transfer portal and infielder Garen Caulfield opted to return for a fourth year rather than begin his pro career. And the 2025 team will have three players from last season’s squad on the coaching staff, with catcher Blake McDonald announced Thursday as the third recent ex-Wildcat to join his former bosses. These guys are bought in— Arizona Baseball (@ArizonaBaseball) Blake McDonald is the third Wildcat from last year's squad joining our staff for the 2025 season! Excited to keep Blake around as a graduate manager [pic.twitter.com/JOPjQxUrAK] [September 5, 2024] McDonald, who played one season for the UA after starting his career at Saint Mary’s, joins ex-UA pitchers Dawson Netz and Bradon Zastrow as managers for 2025. A .297 hitter with two home runs and 18 RBI, McDonald split catching duties last season with Adonys Guzman, who is coming back for his junior year. The Wildcats have three other catchers on their fall roster, and it’s likely that McDonald will assist hitting coach Toby DeMello with that position. Netz, who finished his UA career tied for second in appearances with 94, and Zastrow will be added help to pitching coach Kevin Vance and director of pitching performance and strategy John DeRouin.",
