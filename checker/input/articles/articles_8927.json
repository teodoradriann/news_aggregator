    "title": "Women on the frontline: Defying the consequences of conflict to care for each other",
    "text": "\nIn contexts of\n[conflict and war](/war-and-conflict) around the world, women are fulfilling indispensable roles to address the healthcare needs of other women in their communities as well as providing important links to care by organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).\nWomen’s regular health needs do not disappear when conflict erupts or war breaks out. Instead, they become more critical, as women struggle to obtain adequate food, safe drinking water or basic sanitation. They also often lose access to contraception, maternity care, or protection from sexually transmitted infections, and become increasingly exposed to incidents of sexual and intimate partner violence.\nAs a result, women face a heightened likelihood of becoming sick or dying, which is why they need dedicated and comprehensive health services and protection as a priority as part of any humanitarian response.\nIn\n[Chad](/chad), [Democratic Republic of Congo](/democratic-republic-congo-drc) and [Palestine](/palestine), and many other contexts of conflict and war, MSF is often only able to establish and expand women’s health services thanks to the contribution of women in the affected communities. They become pivotal to the response, sharing their skills, their lived experience, their local knowledge and their solidarity to enable more women to have access to medical care and social support, and avoid suffering in silence.\nKhadija Yahia Adam* is an experienced midwife and one of the more than 600,000 Sudanese\n[refugees](/refugees-idps-and-people-move) now trying to survive in Chad. Most of the refugee women in eastern Chad prefer delivering at home, assisted by midwives in the community.\nHowever, in a camp like Adré, midwives typically lack the necessary tools and hygienic conditions, which exacerbate the risks for mothers and their babies. Khadija is unable to work formally in Chad but has been trained by MSF as a volunteer, supporting much-needed antenatal and postnatal care and referrals for safe delivery care at the MSF-run maternity department.\nAs midwives, community health volunteers, intercultural mediators and in other roles, women provide comfort and confidential advice, sometimes in the privacy of their own homes. They refer women to appropriate services or directly participate themselves in providing contraceptive care, pregnancy and postnatal care,\n[sexual violence](/sexual-violence) care and [safe abortion care](/safe-abortion-care), and mental health support.\nThey play a vital role by raising awareness about\n[women’s health](/womens-health) issues, enhancing community engagement and reducing stigma. They can also support women with the knowledge and skills to manage parts of their own healthcare through self-care, enabling them to care for themselves and others.\nAmong the many people displaced due to surging conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, community healthcare volunteers like Henriette Mbitse are helping increase survivors’ safe and confidential access to care in MSF’s sexual violence care programme in Kanyaruchinya.\nMaman Henriette, as she’s affectionately called, was a health volunteer in her home village before fleeing with her family. Clara* too fled to Kanyaruchinya, from Rutshuru territory, with eight children in her care. She was raped when she went to collect wood in the forest to sell as firewood.\nThe actions of these community members demonstrate their own resilience in the face of having fled conflict and being displaced; surviving direct violence; grieving the loss of a family member or more; being the head of their household with children to care for and protect; and often looking into a future filled with uncertainty.\nNoura Arafat, an MSF intercultural mediator, has lived in Nablus in Palestine’s West Bank all her life. Since the\n[war in Gaza](/gaza-israel-war), the situation across the occupied West Bank, including in Nablus, has continued to worsen, with greater movement restrictions and increased violence by settlers and Israeli forces.\nGrief is one of the many challenges women face. Noura helps women from her community access support in MSF’s mental health programme to cope and to find hope in life.\n*Name changed to protect identity",

    "text": "حذّرت دراسة حديثة من أن الأطباء غالبا ما يتغاضون عن سبب هرموني شائع لارتفاع ضغط الدم.\nوذكرت مجلة \"الغدد الصماء السريرية والتمثيل الغذائي\"، أن قرابة 30 بالمئة من مرضى ارتفاع ضغط الدم الذين يزورون أخصائيّ أمراض القلب و14 بالمئة من المرضى الذين يُراجعون أطباء الرعاية الأولية، يعانون من حالة تُعرف باسم \"فرط الألدوستيرونية الأولية\".\nورغم ذلك، أشار الباحثون إلى أن الكثير من هؤلاء المرضى لا يخضعون أبدا لتحليل دم للكشف عن هذه الحالة، والتي تتمثل في إفراز الغدتين الكظريتين لكميات مفرطة من هرمون \"الألدوستيرون\".\nوأضاف الباحثون أن بعض المرضى يُجرى لهم الفحص بعد سنوات من تشخيصهم الأولي بارتفاع ضغط الدم، ما يؤدي إلى تفاقم الحالة وظهور مضاعفات صحية خطيرة بحلول ذلك الوقت.\nوقالت الدكتورة غايل أدلر، اختصاصية الغدد الصماء في مستشفى \"بريغهام آند وومينز\" في بوسطن، والمؤلفة الرئيسية للدراسة: \"الأشخاص المصابون بفرط الألدوستيرونية الأولية يواجهون خطرا أعلى للإصابة بأمراض القلب والأوعية الدموية مقارنة بمن يعانون من ارتفاع ضغط الدم الأساسي.\"\nوأضافت أدلر في بيان صحفي: \"من خلال فحص دم منخفض التكلفة، يمكننا تحديد عدد أكبر من المصابين بهذه الحالة، والتأكد من حصولهم على العلاج المناسب\"، وفقما نقلت وكالة \"يو بي آي\" للأنباء.\nوذكر الباحثون في الدراسة أن هرمون الألدوستيرون يلعب دورا في تنظيم مستويات الصوديوم والبوتاسيوم في الدم، لكن ارتفاع مستوياته قد يؤدي إلى فقدان الجسم للبوتاسيوم واحتباس المزيد من الصوديوم، ما يؤدي إلى ارتفاع ضغط الدم.\nووفقا لملاحظات إضافية في الدراسة، فإن الأشخاص المصابين بفرط الألدوستيرونية الأولية هم:\n- أكثر عرضة للإصابة بالسكتة الدماغية بمعدل 2.6 مرة.- أكثر عرضة للإصابة بفشل القلب بمعدل مرتين.- أكثر عرضة للإصابة بعدم انتظام ضربات القلب بمعدل 3.5 مرات.- أكثر عرضة للإصابة بأمراض القلب بنسبة 77 بالمئة.\nوأوصت الإرشادات التي قدمتها الدراسة الجديدة بأن يخضع كل من يتم تشخيصه بارتفاع ضغط الدم لفحص لمستويات الألدوستيرون، وفي حال اكتشاف فرط الألدوستيرونية الأولية، يُقدّم له علاج مخصص لهذه الحالة.\nوأشار الباحثون أيضا في دراستهم إلى أن الأطباء قد يوصون بإجراء جراحة لإزالة إحدى الغدتين الكظريتين في حال كانت واحدة فقط تُنتج كميات زائدة من الألدوستيرون.\nكما يُنصح المرضى باتباع نظام غذائي متوازن منخفض الصوديوم، والسعي إلى فقدان الوزن.\nمشاهدة الأطباء يتجاهلون سببا شائعا لارتفاع ضغط الدم\nيذكر بـأن الموضوع التابع لـ الأطباء يتجاهلون سببا شائعا لارتفاع ضغط الدم قد تم نشرة ومتواجد على Tayyar.org وقد قام فريق التحرير في برس بي بالتاكد منه وربما تم التعديل علية وربما قد يكون تم نقله بالكامل اوالاقتباس منه ويمكنك قراءة ومتابعة مستجدادت هذا الخبر او الموضوع من مصدره الاساسي.\nوختاما نتمنى ان نكون قد قدمنا لكم من موقع Pressbee تفاصيل ومعلومات، الأطباء يتجاهلون \"سببا شائعا\" لارتفاع ضغط الدم.\nفي الموقع ايضا :",

    "title": "OpenAI won’t let politicians use its tech for campaigning, for now",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence company OpenAI laid out its plans and policies to try to stop people from using its technology to spread disinformation and lies about elections, as billions of people in some of the world’s biggest democracies head to the polls this year.\nThe company, which makes the popular ChatGPT chatbot, DALL-E image generator and provides AI technology to many companies, including Microsoft, said in a Monday blog post that it wouldn’t allow people to use its tech to build applications for political campaigns and lobbying, to discourage people from voting or spread misinformation about the voting process. OpenAI said it would also begin putting embedded watermarks - a tool to detect AI-created photographs - into images made with its DALL-E image-generator “early this year.”\n“We work to anticipate and prevent relevant abuse - such as misleading ‘deepfakes,’ scaled influence operations, or chatbots impersonating candidates,” OpenAI said in the blog post.\nPolitical parties, state actors and opportunistic internet entrepreneurs have used social media for years to spread false information and influence voters. But activists, politicians and AI researchers have expressed concern that chatbots and image generators could increase the sophistication and volume of political misinformation.\nOpenAI’s measures come after other tech companies have also updated their election policies to grapple with the AI boom. In December, Google said it would restrict the kind of answers its AI tools give to election-related questions. It also said it would require political campaigns that bought ad spots from it to disclose when they used AI. Facebook parent Meta also requires political advertisers to disclose if they used AI.\nBut the companies have struggled to administer their own election misinformation polices. Though OpenAI bars using its products to create targeted campaign materials, an August report by the Post showed these policies were not enforced.\nThere have already been high-profile instances of election-related lies being generated by AI tools. In October, The Washington Post reported that Amazon’s Alexa home speaker was falsely declaring that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and full of election fraud.\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has expressed concern that ChatGPT could interfere with the electoral process, telling people to go to a fake address when asked what to do if lines are too long at a polling location.\nIf a country wanted to influence the U.S. political process it could, for example, build human-sounding chatbots that push divisive narratives in American social media spaces, rather than having to pay human operatives to do it. Chatbots could also craft personalized messages tailored to each voter, potentially increasing their effectiveness at low costs.\nIn the blog post, OpenAI said it was “working to understand how effective our tools might be for personalized persuasion.” The company recently opened its “GPT Store,” which allows anyone to easily train a chatbot using data of their own.\nGenerative AI tools do not have an understanding of what is true or false. Instead, they predict what a good answer might be to a question based on crunching through billions of sentences ripped from the open internet. Often, they provide humanlike text full of helpful information. They also regularly make up untrue information and pass it off as fact.\nImages made by AI have already shown up all over the web, including in Google search, being presented as real images. They’ve also started appearing in U.S. election campaigns. Last year, an ad released by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s campaign used what appeared to be AI-generated images of Donald Trump hugging former White House coronavirus adviser Anthony S. Fauci. It’s unclear which image generator was used to make the images.\nOther companies, including Google and photoshop maker Adobe, have said they will also use watermarks in images generated by their AI tools. But the technology isn’t a magic cure for the spread of fake AI images. Visible watermarks can be easily cropped or edited out. Embedded, cryptographic ones, which are not visible to the human eye, can be distorted simply by flipping the image or changing its color.\nTech companies say they’re working to improve this problem and make them tamper-proof, but for now none seem to have figured out how to do that effectively yet.\nCat Zakrzewski contributed to this report.",

Vendredi 31 mai, en fin d’après-midi, plusieurs chrétiens étaient réunis en l’église Saint-Germain, à Bort-les-Orgues, pour l’adoration du Saint Sacrement et une messe célébrée par le père Didier Delpirou. Une heure plus tard, le cortège, fort d’une vingtaine de paroissiens, a pris la direction de la statue de Notre-Dame de Bort, qui domine la ville, sur les hauteurs de l’ancien champ de foire.\nL’origine du pèlerinage, qui a traditionnellement lieu le dernier jour du mois de Marie, remonte à la construction du barrage. Les habitants avaient une peur bleue de cette imposante masse d’eau stockée au-dessus de leur tête. La consécration de la paroisse à Notre-Dame de Bort a eu lieu en l’église paroissiale, le 8 décembre 1958, année marquant aussi le centenaire des apparitions de la Vierge à Lourdes. Quant à la première procession à Bort-les-Orgues, elle s’est déroulée il y a soixante ans, le 31 mai 1959, en présence de plusieurs centaines de personnes.",

    "title": "Why Are iPhone 16 Models Overheating? Causes, Fixes, and Tips",
    "text": "The iPhone 16 models, including the Pro and Pro Max, have been reported to experience significant overheating issues, with over 500 users sharing their experiences on Apple community forums and social media. Many have described excessive heat during calls and charging, while others report noticeable warmth even during light use. Such reports have sparked discussions in Apple communities, emphasizing the need for further investigation. The device gets excessively hot when charging and during regular use. After just five days, this behavior is concerning and not normal.\nUsers have reported trading in older models, like the iPhone 12 Pro, and not experiencing these issues with their previous devices. The overheating in iPhone 16 models could be linked to their advanced hardware and software capabilities, including a more powerful processor, which generates additional heat during intensive tasks. Furthermore, the new features in iOS 18 may require more power, contributing to higher device temperatures, especially during prolonged use or initial setup. For instance, one user noted that their iPhone 12 Pro never became uncomfortably hot during calls, but their iPhone 16 overheated after a 10-minute conversation, forcing them to end the call prematurely. Other users have shared similar experiences, highlighting a noticeable difference in thermal performance between the models.\nIf the phone were truly overheating to a dangerous level, it would display a thermometer warning, stating that it needs to cool down before further use. However, consistent heat issues can still be alarming, especially for a new device.\nA new iPhone often works very hard in the background during the first few days, indexing millions of bytes of data. The amount of data transferred from an old phone to the new one can influence how long this background activity lasts. During this period, performance and temperature fluctuations are common as the device settles.\nIt is important to note that some activities, such as charging or performing computationally intensive tasks (e.g., video editing or gaming), can generate heat. This is normal behavior for most smartphones and should not be cause for alarm in moderation. Apple advises keeping the iPhone, power adapter, and any wireless charger in a well-ventilated area when in use or charging. Examples of well-ventilated areas include open desks or tables away from enclosed spaces like drawers or under pillows and blankets. Avoid placing the device on heat-trapping surfaces such as couches or beds while charging.\nChanges in software, such as upgrades, may also introduce new features that increase power drain and heat generation. Checking Settings > Battery can help identify apps running in the background that consume significant power. Consider disabling features such as Background App Refresh (Settings > General > Background App Refresh) or Location Services (Settings > Privacy > Location Services) to reduce power usage.\nFor new devices, initial setup and background activities may cause temporary heat generation. It’s best to give the device a day or two to complete these tasks and then reevaluate the situation.\nTroubleshooting Fixes Avoid Intensive Usage: During the initial setup phase, refrain from heavy gaming, video editing, or other intensive activities. Check for Software Updates: Ensure the latest version of iOS is installed, as software bugs can contribute to overheating and battery problems. Update Your iPhone: Go to Settings > General > Software Update and install the latest iOS version. Updates often include fixes for bugs that could cause overheating. Reset Settings: Navigate to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset and select “Reset All Settings.” This action will not erase data but can resolve misconfigurations . Inspect Battery Usage: Go to Settings > Battery to identify if any specific app is consuming excessive power. Consider deleting or updating problematic apps. Avoid Using the Phone While Charging: Using the phone while it’s plugged in can generate additional heat. Contact Apple Support: If overheating persists after several days, reaching out to Apple for assistance is recommended. The device may have a hardware issue requiring attention. For professional help, consider scheduling a Genius Bar appointment by following these steps:\nVisit Genius Bar Reservation and Apple Support Options – Apple . Select “ Get hardware help .” Choose the affected hardware and continue selecting options related to replacing parts until the “Bring in for Repair” option appears. Sign in with your Apple ID to complete the reservation. Alternatively, initial heat may also result from the setup phase, where the phone performs intensive indexing of data and apps. This phase should resolve in a day or two, leading to a more stable performance.\nRelated articles:",

    "text": "Mangaluru: Leaders of various political parties and organisations have expressed ire over RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat’s statement on Muslim women and are gearing up to hold protests seeking his arrest.The Joint Forum of Secular Parties in Dakshina Kannada, headed by former minister B Ramanath Rai of the Congress and DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla, said on Thursday, that the police should arrest Bhat immediately in connection with the case registered against him at the Srirangapatna town police station in Mandya district. “Bhat has not only spoken ill about Muslim women, but also dishonoured womanhood. There is a conspiracy to sow the seeds of communal hatred behind Bhat’s statements. Bhat, who is upset over a Congress government in Karnataka, has been making provocative statements for political reasons,” said forum president Ramanath Rai.Forum secretary Muneer Katipalla said that Bhat has been making provocative statements to divide the society for the past 35 years. “It is shameful that Bhat, a medical practitioner and a senior citizen, has made obscene remarks. Bhat is under the impression that Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts will see repercussions if he is arrested. However, the fact is that people in the coastal region cutting across all castes, religions and politics have expressed their objections to his remarks against Muslim women. The government should argue strongly against Bhat’s appeal in the high court and ensure his early arrest,” Muneer said.CPM leader K Yadava Shetty, CPI leader B Shekhara, DSS state convener M Devadas, social activist MG Hegde, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha member Adithya Kallaje, AITUC member Karunakara Maripalla, District Congress Committee Minority Cell president Shahul Hameed and advocate Dinesh Hegde Ulepady were present. DYFI Ullal taluk unit stated in a release that the members will hold a protest demanding the arrest of Bhat at Masthikatte in Ullal at 5pm on December 29.WIM to fight legally Women India Movement (WIM) state president Fathima Naseema said that the organisation will take the constitutional route to fight against RSS leader Bhat.She told reporters at the Pathrika Bhavan, here, on Thursday that the Congress government has been exhibiting its inability in handling the case against Bhat. “By not acting against Bhat, the government is also indirectly showing disregard to the women. The police have refused permission for WIM to hold a protest against Bhat and also served notices to women. The government should ensure the arrest of Bhat immediately, if it has faith in democracy and Constitution,” she added.",

    "text": "’Appennino Bike Tour’ inaugura la segnaletica\nUn arrivo al traguardo da record. È quello messo a segno da ’Appennino Bike Tour’, l’itinerario cicloturistico nazionale attraverso gli Appennini nato a Bologna durante il G7 Ambiente del 2017 e sostenuto fin dal suo esordio da Confcommercio Ascom Bologna e Confcommercio nazionale, che ha presentato alla Camera dei Deputati la nuova segnaletica a servizio dei cicloturisti. All’evento erano presenti, insieme all’ideatore del progetto Enrico Della Torre, direttore generale Vivi Appennino, Galeazzo Bignami, vice ministro Infrastrutture e Trasporti, Giancarlo Tonelli, direttore generale Confcommercio Ascom Bologna, Giuseppe Pucci, sindaco di Gaggio Montano, Cesare Rossi, presidente Asso s.r.l., Stefano Ciafani, presidente Legambiente e Camilla Colussi, Marketing Gruppo Colussi.\nDa Altare, in provincia di Savona, ad Alia, in provincia di Palermo, sono stati 1.584 i cartelli urbani ed extraurbani di indicazione turistica installati per rendere visibile la più grande direttrice di mobilità e sviluppo sostenibile del Paese. Il simbolo della bicicletta con sfondo blu e la scritta ‘Appennino Bike Tour’ consentirà ai cicloturisti di pedalare con semplicità e godersi appieno il patrimonio di eccellenze dei nostri Appennini, dalla Liguria alla Sicilia, tra natura, storia, cultura, enogastronomia e tradizioni. Il Comune di Gaggio Montano, a testimonianza del profondo legame tra un progetto a vocazione nazionale come ‘Appennino Bike Tour’ e il territorio metropolitano bolognese, ha svolto come capofila degli enti locali attraversati dalla ciclovia la funzione di stazione appaltante per la fornitura e posa in opera della segnaletica, finanziata dal Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti.\n\"Si tratta di un’opera di estremo valore per i tanti piccoli comuni d’Italia, finanziata dal nostro Ministero e sostenuta negli anni - sottolinea il vice ministro Galeazzo Bignami -. Mettere a sistema 14 Regioni e 300 Comuni è stata una scommessa per tutti e sono orgoglioso che i dirigenti del nostro Ministero siano riusciti ad individuare l’iter procedurale più semplice che consentisse di realizzare un’opera così grande. Siamo convinti che i piccoli Comuni di questi territori potranno beneficiare di un importante sviluppo e per questo è fondamentale continuare in questa direzione\".\n\"Appennino Bike Tour è un progetto nato e cresciuto a Bologna e come sistema Confcommercio, sia a livello metropolitano, sia a livello nazionale, lo abbiamo sostenuto e continueremo a sostenerlo - afferma Giancarlo Tonelli, direttore generale Confcommercio Ascom Bologna -. Quello che stiamo festeggiando è un passaggio fondamentale per un itinerario cicloturistico che ha il merito di congiungere il Paese e tenere insieme al meglio economia e sostenibilità. Appennino Bike Tour ha senza dubbio le carte in regola per fare da volano di sviluppo delle aree interne e montane, generando importanti ricadute anche a beneficio delle attività economiche del terziario che operano in quei territori, fragili ma ricchi di eccellenze .\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",
