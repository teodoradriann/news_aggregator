Another way to save is to go to free attractions. Visit the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, The Vessel, take the Staten Island Ferry, visit Times Square, Little Island or visit the 9/11 Memorial. If you don’t want sub-zero cold or oppressive heat, we recommend visiting in spring and autumn. From late March to early May, you can enjoy warm weather that is suitable for enjoying the city on foot and visiting the outdoor scenery. Traveling in late September, October or November is perfect for those who prefer mild weather with a slight chill in the morning and at night.

    "title": "Fox News’ Pete Hegseth Offers Up Prayer During Live Segment",
    "text": "With Easter fast approaching, Fox News host Pete Hegseth led coworkers in a\nlive prayer to acknowledge the close of the Lenten season. The prayer was part of a segment promoting the Catholic prayer app Hallow. The app has notable Catholics share prayers and daily devotionals from the likes of Jonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus on “The Chosen,” and actor Mark Wahlberg. Hegseth called on his co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Will Cain as well as their viewing audience to join him in reading one of Hallow’s Lenten prayers.\n“It’s the fifth Sunday of Lent, and our prayer series continues with the reading of prayer from the Hallow app. We all need it; let’s do it this morning,” said Hegseth, instructing everyone to “Close your eyes. If you would, bow your head.” The prayer was also displayed on-screen for viewers. “Jesus, today we begin the holy period of passion tide,” Hegseth prayed. “In these last 2 weeks of Lent, help us understand the mystery of Your sacrifice and surrender, make us keenly aware of Your love for us. We ask that You make Yourself known to us, help us to feel the grace of Your presence,” he said. He added that Christ had “journeyed to the cross for our sake” and asked that God would help others “to see ourselves the way you see us and come to believe that we are worthy of your abounding love.” He finished the recitation, asking that God would “Aspire in us the same sacrificial, selfless love you showed on the cross. Oh, Jesus, we surrender ourselves to you. Take care of everything. Amen.”\nHegseth has often taken a Christian focus through his work with Fox News. He hosted a 6-episode series called “The Life of Jesus,” with\npart one being released at Christmas time 2022, with Hegseth traveling the roads that Jesus traveled. Part two was released last year at Easter, with Hegseth focusing on Christ’s betrayal and crucifixion. He previously called the project his “passion” and that he wanted “to remind — first and foremost — myself, my family but, writ large, our culture of the reason for the season. Underneath all of that pageantry [of the holidays] is the truth, and the birth of a baby in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago, and the life that Jesus, fully God and fully man, lived.” He has also spoken about how fatherhood has shifted his focus on the Gospels. “I’ve got a bunch of kids, and you start to realize that the only thing that matters is introducing them to Jesus Christ,” he said. “You spend so much time teaching them how to dribble a basketball or to love America — and those are all great, but they’re utterly insufficient.”",

    "title": "Israel Will Triumph - American Thinker",
    "text": "Jewish history is like a tapestry. You tug at a thread from a thousand years ago and a similar thread will be felt hundreds of years later.\nWhat happened on October 7, 2023 in Israel is merely another point in the long history of the rabid hatred of the Jewish people. A single thread connects the persecutions of Haman, Hitler’s Holocaust, and the brutal atrocities committed by Hamas.\nBut in 2024 we have a resurgence of such vile reprehensible deeds that one can easily despair of civilization.\nThe Jewish holiday Purim depicts the evil of Haman, a Persian vizier who sought “to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in a single day.” It began in the ancient country of Persia but the incantation of anti-Semitism thrives in modern day Iran . Hamas, Hezb’allah, and other proxies of Iran seek to obliterate Israel.\nThe mainstream media has yet to adequately publicize the wickedness and atrocities perpetrated against Israelis. Who will weep for the captives held by Hamas ? Who besides those who knew them will mourn the irreparable loss of these people ?\nWho will shut down the corrupt International Court of Justice in The Hague (ICJ) which openly sides with those who want Israel to halt its military offensive? Take a close look at the young female victims of Hamas whose lives (if they are still even alive) are beyond comprehension. Raped, beaten, tortured, mutilated, possibly impregnated -- their dreams totally destroyed.\nEach individual stands for a human soul, a Jewish soul who has grievously suffered.\nEqually upsetting is the fact that young Americans are not taught about evil .\nNothing is more important than the study of good and evil. When it comes to evil, the ignorance is enormous, often almost total. For example, according to Pew, about half of Americans ages 18-39 cannot identify Auschwitz or any other Nazi death camp.\nIn other words, a true depiction of the evils of the 20th century would mean the end of the two pillars of left-wing ideology: secularism and big government. This is why young people know almost nothing about evil.\nAnd the neo-Nazi Left keeps brainwashing the young and naïve.\nIn fact, “Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei understands that while Iran cannot defeat the U.S. militarily, it can strive to erode its foundations through propaganda . Khamenei himself directs the propaganda activity aimed at linking the American students’ support for Gaza with the destruction of the U.S. itself, using these students.”\nThis cognitive activity is preplanned and intended to generate support for the Palestinian cause among Americans at large and others who do not understand or have a personal connection to the issue.\nSadly, even many Americans “fail to understand a traumatized nation facing genocidal foes.” Israelis realize that “a state in Gaza, as well as one in Judea and Samaria, controlled by genocidal terrorists and their morally equivalent political rivals -- the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah Party -- could place the entire country in danger.”\nAnd then there is the latest news that the FBI has gone from fighting Islamic terrorists to taking orders from them! “Never Again” has become “Yet Again\" as ignorant and hateful American university students side with the Islamic jihadists.\nHamas leader abroad Khaled Mashal thanked the ‘great student Flood’ emerging from American, European, and Western universities. Mashal called for a ‘financial Flood’ supplying Palestinians with food and other supplies, as well as weapons for the mujahedeen. He called for a ‘media Flood’ spreading the Palestinian narrative and a ‘legal Flood’ [.]\nIndian Islamic scholar Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadwi “called for Muslims worldwide to attack Israel, eliminate ‘this worm,’ and destroy Tel Aviv.”\nMuslim leaders emulate Hitler’s recruitment of children soldiers. Consequently, “Hizbullah-Affiliated Lebanese academic Sadek Al-Naboulsi said in a May 15, 2024 interview that was uploaded to Tafasil on YouTube that Hitler's Germany recruited child soldiers. He asked: ‘Why shouldn't we do the same?’ Al-Naboulsi said that there is nothing shameful about raising children to sacrifice their lives.”\nMartin Luther King Jr. said “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”\nWhat is more depraved -- these unspeakable acts or the worldwide support they are receiving. Instead of uniformly condemning the most barbaric atrocities in modern history, the Biden regime means to reward these savages with aid and a state.\nPalestinian civilians laughed while they raped and butchered Israelis. But Norway, Spain and Ireland now recognize a state of Palestine.\nIn 2014, Sweden, became the first EU member in western Europe to recognize a Palestinian state. This occurred despite contemporary anti-Semitism brought by Muslim migrants.\nThe imported form of antisemitism we are witnessing in Sweden is not about criticizing the Israeli government, nor is it about a call for peace, a call to return the hostages, or finding solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, it’s about ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,’ a call for the elimination of Israel and the denial of the Jews to exist as people in their own homeland. This imported ‘Middle Eastern’ antisemitism is deeply rooted in Jew-hatred, whitewashed by pretending to call for a ceasefire.\nIn 1941 the mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini told Hitler that the Arabs were Germany’s natural friends because they both wanted to see the extermination of the Jewish people.\nThe Islamization of Europe continues to embolden Nazi/Hamas ideology and destroy a continent which has so easily forgotten the horrors of the Holocaust.\nReleased hostage Amit Soussana recounts the horrors she endured at the hands of Hamas kidnappers.\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog said that Soussana ‘speaks for all those who cannot speak. She speaks for all the victims of Hamas’ despicable sexual crimes and abuse. She speaks for all women everywhere.’\nBut where are the outcries from women’s groups regarding the inhumane attacks on Israeli women?\nAs the United Nations promotes an awareness campaign ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25, chilling accounts from survivors and first responders who witnessed Hamas’s October 7 massacre of 1,200 Israelis paint a horrifying picture of systemic sexual assaults perpetrated against women and girls of all ages.\nYet many feminist and women’s rights organizations worldwide have remained conspicuously silent -- and some are even questioning the veracity of the accusations.\nThe feminist movement has lost its moral compass because of its indifference to its Jewish sisters.\nThis year, in the Jewish homeland, we were truly not safe as the evil ones destroyed the sanctity of our homes, the innocence of our children, and our sense of security.\nTo those who parrot the lies of Hamas, please note that Israeli Arabs have full rights. The “charges against Israel’s various ‘ occupations’ represent -- and are plainly intended to be -- a damning indictment of the entire Zionist enterprise.”\nMoreover, they are also grossly false. In 1948, no Palestinian state was invaded or destroyed to make way for the establishment of Israel. Moreover, Israel’s disengagemen t from Gaza occurred in 2005.\nThe yearning for Zion or Israel has been a constant in Jewish prayer. The word Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times and Zion appears 154 times. The Koran makes no mention of Jerusalem. Indeed, Jews are the indigenous people of the region.\nIsrael must win and terminate the evil ones. The West must finally gird itself against the Islamic jihadists who despise liberty and seek a global caliphate. America and freedom-loving countries must eradicate those who delight in the wickedness of Jew hatred.\nEileen can be reached at middlemarch18@gmail.com\nImage: Ted Eytan",

    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) Northern Lights put on spectacular display above UK – will we see them tonight? The UK was treated to a stunning display of the Northern Lights last night with the natural phenomenon visible as far south as [London](//metro.co.uk/tag/london/?ico=auto_link_news_P1_LNK1) and Kent. Stunning pictures [captured the aurora borealis across the UK](//metro.co.uk/2024/10/10/can-see-northern-lights-uk-tonight-21769612/) as it filled the sky with pink and green hues. The Northern Lights, most closely associated with the Arctic and other countries closer to the poles, are visible further south at the moment thanks to a geomagnetic [storm](//metro.co.uk/tag/storms/?ico=auto_link_news_P3_LNK1) raging in the atmosphere. Plus, it was a clear and cloudless night for many last night, making it even easier to spot the aurora borealis. [Two solar flares erupted](//metro.co.uk/2024/10/04/earth-firing-line-biggest-solar-eruption-years-21733464/) from the sun last week, and it’s thought the Earth [‘clipped the edge’ of the two flares](//metro.co.uk/2024/10/04/can-see-northern-lights-tonight-this-week-21734444/), creating the geomagnetic storm which signals the arrival of the Northern Lights. This latest arrival of the aurora was caused by a fast coronal mass ejection – also known as a large expulsion of plasma and magnetic field – which left the sun on Wednesday, causing severe geomagnetic storms. We’ve been lucky enough to see more of the aurora borealis in recent months, [most notably in May](//metro.co.uk/video/best-unprecedented-northern-lights-uk-world-3187373/), because the sun is currently in a more active part of its cycle. The sun’s cycle lasts for about 11 years as its magnetic fields flip, and during the ‘solar maximum’ phase, there are many more solar flares and solar storms, meaning the Northern Lights appear much further south than they normally would. But don’t get complacent about seeing the aurora borealis, because it’s hard to tell when the ‘solar maximum’ will end and solar activity will start to decrease again. And it looks like the chances of seeing the Northern Lights will be getting much slimmer tonight. The Met Office’s latest space weather forecast says: ‘The chances of aurora remain initially, though gradually easing through October 11, becoming increasingly confined to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.’ On top of that, the atmospheric weather forecast says we’ll be seeing ‘rain across Scotland and Northern Ireland becoming more widespread through the night, although far north clearer with the odd wintry shower’ – which doesn’t sound promising for the clear conditions required to spot the aurora.
