    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel - SaskToday.ca",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "MESA, Ariz. — Durante casi una semana, una familia de Mesa ha cuestionado cómo su hija y su hermana pasaron de ser víctimas a ser sospechosas ante las autoridades.\n“No he escuchado ni hablado con mi hija desde que la encerraron”, aseguró Tara Adams.\nDesde el viernes, su hija Tyra, de 17 años, ha estado bajo custodia en el Centro de Detención Juvenil del Condado Maricopa.\nAdams dijo que la última vez que vio a Tyra, estaba esposada a una cama de hospital en el hospital Banner University Medical Center después de sufrir lesiones en la cabeza, cortes y moretones después de ser abordada por un oficial de policía de Mesa el viernes por la tarde en la High School Westwood.\n\"No puedo creer que esto haya sucedido\", comentó Adams.\nEl viernes por la tarde, Adams dice que Tyra fue arrestada después de un incidente en la escuela.\nElla dice que Tyra dijo que un grupo de jóvenes la estaban acosando, amenazando e intimidando en la escuela durante las últimas semanas. Adams dice que su hija notificó a los maestros y administradores de lo que estaba sucediendo.\nEl viernes, dijo Adams, resultó ser cuando la olla explotó para Tyra.\n\"Ella dijo: 'Me estaban tocando y manoseando, y le pedí al guardia de seguridad que dejaran de tocarme y que me ayudara, pero él simplemente me ignoró'\", explicó Adams.\nEl video obtenido por 12News parece mostrar a Tyra siendo tocada por un joven que se acerca a ella.\n\"Ella me dijo que el tipo estaba tratando de agarrarla por tercera vez cuando justo cuando ella estaba hablando con el guardia de seguridad\", dijo Adams.\nEl vídeo también parece mostrar a un guardia de seguridad presenciando el incidente, pero no se toma ninguna medida al respecto.\nUn segundo video obtenido por 12News muestra a Tyra parada afuera con otros muchachos cuando un hombre se acerca detrás de ella y parece intentar quitarle algo de la mano.\nLuego, Tyra se da vuelta y comienza a empujarlo, momento en el que un oficial de policía de Mesa rápidamente la agarra y la tira al suelo para someterla.\n“Me molesta. Eso me enoja. Ella sólo mide 4 pies y 11 pulgadas. Es pequeña, es muy pequeña”, dijo Tailor White, la hermana de Tyra.\nDijo que el vídeo de su hermana es muy complicado de poder verlo.\n“El tipo que la está tocando no lo derribó al suelo. La derribaron al suelo\", dijo White.\nLa familia dijo que durante casi una semana no tuvieron contacto con las Escuelas Públicas de Mesa ni con la policía de esa ciudad en la investigación. La familia contactó a 12News para obtener respuestas sobre lo sucedido.\n\"Publicamos un SOS sólo para ver si alguien grabó lo que sucedió\", dijo White. \"El hecho de que la escuela no dijo nada hasta que los llamamos y luego fue como 'oh, ahora queremos hacer algo'\".\n12News contactó a las Escuelas Públicas de Mesa, quienes proporcionaron esta declaración que se envió a los padres de Westwood el viernes sobre el incidente:\nEstimadas familias de Westwood High School,\nLe escribo para brindarle información importante sobre un incidente que ocurrió en nuestro campus hoy durante el período del almuerzo.\nUna estudiante experimentó un episodio médico que la llevó a amenazar con dañar a los estudiantes y miembros del personal. La seguridad de nuestro campus actuó con rapidez y eficacia para interceptar al estudiante, garantizando la seguridad de todas las personas involucradas. Quiero enfatizar que no hubo heridos como resultado de este incidente.\nInmediatamente nos comunicamos con el Departamento de Policía de Mesa, que actualmente está llevando a cabo una investigación exhaustiva. Además, el estudiante actualmente recibe atención y apoyo médico.\nLa seguridad es una prioridad absoluta en Westwood. Aproveche esta oportunidad para discutir cualquier inquietud o pregunta que su hijo pueda tener sobre los eventos de hoy. Nuestro personal de asesoramiento y servicios de apoyo están disponibles para brindar orientación y asistencia según sea necesario. Tenga la seguridad de que estamos dedicados a mantener un entorno de aprendizaje seguro y enriquecedor para todos los estudiantes de Westwood High School.\nGracias por su continua ayuda .\nLa familia de Tyra no cree que haya algo \"médico\" con ella a la hora de los hechos.\n“Estaba siendo agredida sexualmente. Fue y le contó a 3 personas lo que estaba pasando, y ellos no hicieron nada”, aseguró Adams.\nLa policía de Mesa le dice a 12News que están investigando el incidente. El departamento también invitó a 12News a revisar el video de la cámara corporal del incidente.\nTyra enfrenta cargos por delitos graves de agresión agravada a un maestro y resistencia al arresto, junto con un delito menor de alteración del orden público.\nLa familia de Tyra continúa buscando respuestas y esperando que ella regrese a casa. Podría pasar otra semana antes de que eso suceda.\nHasta entonces, dicen que seguirán luchando por la chica que, según dicen, ama el color rosa y alguien a quien describen como buena persona e inteligente.\n“Solo quiero justicia para mi hermana. Necesitan saber que nada de esto estuvo bien”, dijo White.\n12News se enteró de que la familia está buscando presentar un informe policial.",

    "text": "Peter Dutton wants more high schoolers to adopt trades. (ABC News: John Gunn)A Dutton government would establish a dozen technical colleges for high schoolers to learn trades and other vocational skills, reviving a Howard-era idea on a smaller scale.The colleges, with at least one in each state, will offer a hybrid of apprenticeships and traineeships and academic courses to students from years 10 to 12, operated in partnership with private companies and not-for-profits with $260 million in federal funding.\\\"I want to see more young Australians learn a trade, build a great career and contribute to our national success,\\\" Mr Dutton said.\\\"Not enough students are taking up the skills we need to solve the urgent national challenges we face.\\\"Sussan Ley, the Coalition\\'s skills spokesperson, told the ABC some of the colleges would use existing facilities, and that the school system was too heavily geared towards university attendance.\\\"We have always rejected the idea that if you haven\\'t made it to university then you haven\\'t made it in life, and that principle underpins this announcement,\\\" she said.Howard-era idea abolished by Rudd, contemplated by AbbottThe Howard government established two dozen technical colleges in 2005 and had promised as many as 100, but funding was removed by the Rudd government, which deemed them outdated given the growth of the TAFE sector. All but a few closed.Tony Abbott promised a revival as opposition leader in the 2010 election, but did not carry this through when elected in 2013.The Coalition is opposed to Labor\\'s multi-billion-dollar push for permanent full-fee TAFE subsidies and has confirmed it will repeal them, arguing it is poorly targeted and promising an alternative skills program of its own.Speaking at a vocational institution in Alice Springs on Tuesday, Labor\\'s skills minister Andrew Giles said fee-free TAFE had been a \\\"runaway success\\\" and had boosted enrolments\\\" and said the opposition would be \\\"slamming shut the door of opportunity\\\" on TAFE students if it proceeded with a repeal.Whichever alternative prevails after the election, the low take-up and completion rates of apprenticeships will remain a significant contributing factor to labour shortages in the construction sector, a key barrier to building more housing.Both parties have ambitions to boost housing supply but have each acknowledged the migration system may also need to be better utilised to fill the shortage, with Mr Dutton promising to prioritise trades on the skills list.",
