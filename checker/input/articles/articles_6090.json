Avoid it and several other listed by NordPass here. Most people recognise the importance of keeping [passwords](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/google-bug-results-in-loss-of-passwords-for-15-million-microsoft-windows-users-71722249461631.html) private. However, we often opt for passwords that are too simple—easy to guess and vulnerable to hackers. The consequences of this are well known. Choosing a strong, hard-to-guess password is a habit everyone should cultivate, especially now that our digital lives are becoming more complex. Unfortunately, many still fall into the bad habit of choosing easily guessable passwords. Now to remind netizens to choose a strong password, NordPass has once again released a list of the [200 most common passwords](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content=8836598&utm_campaign=off490&utm_source=aff34741&aff_free) found across the internet for 2024.

This suggests that many people use the same weak passwords for both personal and professional accounts, leaving them vulnerable across the board. Despite repeated warnings, there has been little improvement in people's password habits over the years. If you lead a digital life, it's crucial to use strong passwords to protect your data—and more importantly, your privacy. Data is one of the most valuable commodities online, and if it's compromised, it can lead to significant personal and financial loss. Tips for Stronger Passwords Use Passkeys: [Passkeys](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/whatsapp-launches-passkeys-for-iphone-users-here-s-how-it-works-and-all-details-71714020153579.html) are becoming increasingly popular, and many services (like Google) support them. Passkeys use your biometric data to sign you in, eliminating the need to remember or store passwords. The passkey is securely stored and only accessible by you. Choose Strong Passwords: If you can't think of a strong password on your own, use a service like Apple's password manager or Google's password manager to generate a secure one. As a rule of thumb, your password should be around 20 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names. Change Your Passwords Regularly: Passwords can be exposed during data breaches, so it's important to change them regularly. Avoid reusing old passwords, and make sure your new password is strong and unique. Use a Password Manager: Consider using a password manager like NordPass to securely store and manage your passwords. If you don't want to pay for one, you can use free options like [Apple](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/photos/iphone-se-4-launch-inching-closer-5-things-to-expect-from-powerful-apple-midranger-71731564332531.html) Passwords app or Google's password managers.

    "text": "The old year, 2023, seemed to put in a good word for itself in Washington on Sunday in its last chance to demonstrate its meteorological assets and abilities. It seemed to make use of ingredients generally available in late December to produce a day that both fell within plausible temperature parameters and demonstrated the radiant glories available in winter. Sunday’s high of 51 degrees was one degree higher than Saturday’s high of 50. It was also five degrees above average for Dec. 31 in the District of Columbia. Broad expanses of blue sky made room for peaceful solar coexistence with a profusion of clouds, but however many the daytime clouds were, none seemed to suggest the dark surliness of winter gloom. Sometimes they seemed to be feathery white structures that, in their attenuated appearance, highlighted their deep blue surroundings and hinted at a world of cold at high altitudes. Perhaps three miles up, where temperatures by atmospheric laws conceivably hovered in the zero-degree range, they resembled the expansion of frost crystals on a cold window pane. On the streets, in the sunshine, Sunday seemed another pleasantly mild December day. It was one more 50-degree day in a month that has seen many such days. It seemed pleasant even if Sunday was, of all December days, celebrated for its position as the most January-adjacent.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Recordings, emails show how Trump team flew fake elector ballots to DC in final push to overturn 2020 election | National-politics | kxly.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — Two days before the January 6 insurrection , the Trump campaign’s plan to use fake electors to block President-elect Joe Biden from taking office faced a potentially crippling hiccup: The fake elector certificates from two critical battleground states were stuck in the mail. So, Trump campaign operatives scrambled to fly copies of the phony certificates from Michigan and Wisconsin to the nation’s capital, relying on a haphazard chain of couriers, as well as help from two Republicans in Congress, to try to get the documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence while he presided over the Electoral College certification. The operatives even considered chartering a jet to ensure the files reached Washington, DC, in time for the January 6, 2021, proceeding, according to emails and recordings obtained by CNN. The new details provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the chaotic last-minute effort to keep Donald Trump in office. The fake electors scheme features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictment against the former president, and some of the officials who were involved have spoken to Smith’s investigators. The emails and recordings also indicate that a top Trump campaign lawyer was part of 11th-hour discussions about delivering the fake elector certificates to Pence, potentially undercutting his testimony to the House select committee that investigated January 6 that he had passed off responsibility and didn’t want to put the former vice president in a difficult spot. These details largely come from pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was an architect of the fake electors plot and is now a key cooperator in several state probes into the scheme. Chesebro pleaded guilty in October to a felony conspiracy charge in Georgia in connection with the electors’ plan, and has met with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, who are investigating the sham GOP electors in their own states. Chesebro is an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal election interference indictment against Trump. CNN has obtained audio of Chesebro’s recent interview with Michigan investigators, and exclusively reported earlier this month that he also told them about a December 2020 Oval Office meeting where he briefed Trump about the fake electors plan and how it ties into January 6. An attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not reply to a request for comment for this story. ‘A high-level decision’ Emails obtained by CNN corroborate what Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors: He communicated with the top Trump campaign lawyer, Matt Morgan, and another campaign official, Mike Roman, to ferry the documents to Washington on January 5. From there, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and a Pennsylvania congressman assisted in the effort to get the documents into Pence’s hands. “This is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there,” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors. “And they had to enlist, you know, a US senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time.” Chesebro also discussed the episode with Wisconsin investigators last week when he sat for an interview with the attorney general’s office as part of a separate state probe into the fake electors plot, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Wisconsin prosecutors asked about the episode “extensively,” the source said, noting Chesebro discussed how a Wisconsin GOP staffer flew the certificate from Milwaukee to Washington and then handed it off to Chesebro. The firsthand account from Chesebro’s perspective helps fill in the narrative behind the effort to hand-deliver elector slates to Pence, which is vaguely referenced in Smith’s federal indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include conspiring with Chesebro and others to obstruct the January 6 certification proceeding. Before Chesebro’s guilty plea in Georgia, his attorneys reached out to Smith’s team. As of this week, he has not heard back from federal prosecutors, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Federal investigators have spoken with several individuals involved in the scramble with the phony elector certificates , according to a source familiar with the matter. This includes interviews with Trump staffers who were tapped to fly the papers to DC, and some fake electors who knew of the planning. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Asked about the episode, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his previous comments , where he said, “my involvement in that attempt to deliver spanned the course of a couple seconds,” and that, “in the end, those electors were not delivered.” ‘Day-by-day’ coordination According to the recordings of Chesebro’s sit-down with Michigan prosecutors, he explained how a legal memo he wrote for Wisconsin transformed into a nationwide operation , where Trump lawyers were “day-by-day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign.” On January 4, 2021, Morgan sent an email to Chesebro and Roman asking for confirmation that all of the Trump elector slates had been received by Congress, according to the documents obtained by CNN. Roman responded that the Michigan certificate had been mailed on December 15 but was still “in transit” at a US Postal Service facility in DC. Wisconsin’s certificate also had apparently not arrived. Chesebro told prosecutors that Morgan was “freaked out” when the campaign realized the phony certificates from Michigan were still in the mail. That same day, Morgan weighed in over email asking Chesebro and Roman to rethink how they would deliver the certificates to Pence. “As I thought about this more, a courier will not be able to access the Capitol to deliver a sealed package,” Morgan wrote on January 4, according to emails obtained by CNN “You will probably need to enlist the help of a legislator who can deliver to the appropriate place(s). I strongly recommend you guys discuss a revised delivery plan with Rudy (Giuliani) to make sure this gets done the way he wants.” ‘Can we charter a flight?’ Roman was concerned the Wisconsin documents wouldn’t reach Washington in time. “Can we charter a flight? The only available commercial from MKE (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport) to DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) arrives at 2130 tomorrow night,” Roman wrote to Chesebro on January 4 at 11:24 p.m. The job of physically flying the elector documents to Washington fell to two people: A Trump campaign staffer and a Wisconsin GOP official, according to the emails and what Chesebro told prosecutors. The Wisconsin GOP official who had that state’s elector documents landed after 10 a.m. on January 5 at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, according to the emails. Trump campaign aide Michael Brown flew with the Michigan certificates to Washington National Airport with a scheduled arrival around 1 p.m., according to emails obtained by CNN. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Brown flew to DC from Atlanta, because the Trump staffers who had custody of the Michigan ballots were in Georgia for the Senate runoffs . The campaign booked and paid for Brown’s flight on Southwest Airlines, the source said. Federal campaign finance records indicate that a pro-Trump super PAC paid the airline on the day of Brown’s flight for travel related to election “recount” efforts. Trump Hotel meetup The emails show that Brown and the Wisconsin GOP official were instructed to meet Chesebro at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington to hand off the fake elector certificates. Chesebro said in an email that he’d keep the ballots in his hotel room safe until it was time to pass them along. Wisconsin Republican Party officials were annoyed at the request to courier the fake elector certificates to Washington. “Freaking trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the senate President,” a Wisconsin GOP official wrote to then-state party chairman Andrew Hitt on January 4, according to the January 6 committee report. Hitt – who has provided information to federal investigators about the efforts to get the fake elector certificates to Washington, according to a source familiar with the matter – told the January 6 committee that the couriering ended up being overkill, because the original documents that the state party had mailed to Washington actually made it in time. Getting the certificates inside the Capitol The documents still had to be hand-delivered to Pence’s Senate office in the Capitol. The electors plot – as envisioned by Chesebro and other Trump allies – was that Pence could reject Biden’s legitimate electors and recognize Trump’s “alternate electors” on January 6, while lawmakers tallied the electoral votes from each state. Per federal law, the certificates need to be physically presented on the floor of Congress during the joint session, while lawmakers tally the electoral votes. Chesebro told investigators that Roman connected him with an aide for a Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker that he believed was Rep. Scott Perry to turn over the documents. Chesebro wasn’t certain which congressman the staffer worked for – and the January 6 report says a staffer for a different Pennsylvania Republican, Rep. Mike Kelly, helped shuttle the documents that day. “I had the Wisconsin stuff. [Trump campaign aide] Mike Brown had the Michigan stuff. We walked to the Longworth Office Building, and the guy with Perry, or whatever his name is, and some other fellow, that were like staff members of the House, took them and said, ‘We’re going to walk them over to the Senate and give it to a Senate staffer,’” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors, according to the audio obtained by CNN. “I don’t know why logistically we didn’t take it directly to Johnson. But that’s how we did it,” he added. Kelly and Perry’s offices did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Brown did not comment for this story. CNN previously reported that he testified in June to Smith’s grand jury in the Trump election subversion probe. CNN previously reported that Roman sat for a proffer interview with Smith’s team before Trump was indicted. He was also indicted in the sweeping Georgia election racketeering case, in connection with the fake electors scheme, and has pleaded not guilty. Roman’s attorney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The details from Chesebro put a finer point on how members of Congress, including a sitting US senator, were involved in making sure the electoral certificates for Trump ended up in Pence’s hands. The January 6 committee first revealed last year Johnson’s involvement in trying unsuccessfully to deliver the fake elector certificates to Pence, who announced on the morning of the joint session that it would be unconstitutional to do what Trump wanted and unilaterally overturn the election results. The committee revealed text messages during their hearings last year that Johnson aide Sean Riley sent to Pence aide Chris Hodgson, saying that Johnson “needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise.” “What is it?” Hodgson asked. “Alternate slates of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Riley responded. “Do not give that to him,” Hodgson said. ‘F**k these guys’ In his Michigan interview, Chesebro also dished on some of the internal disagreements among the Trump lawyers, campaign officials and other allies, who clashed over the purpose of the electors’ plan and how far to take things on January 6. Chesebro has maintained – then, and now – that the plan was a lawful move to preserve Trump’s legal rights. Even before the Trump electors met in their state capitals on December 14, 2020, to cast their fake ballots and sign the certificates, Chesebro heard about concerns from some of the electors about possible legal jeopardy, according to emails and text messages reported by the Detroit News and obtained by CNN. Chesebro added hedging language for the faux certificates from Pennsylvania and New Mexico in response to those concerns. He proposed to Roman and Morgan that they add the contingency caveats to the paperwork for all seven states in the plan. But Roman rejected the idea, according to the emails. “F**k these guys,” Roman texted Chesebro on December 12, 2020. By this time, the Trump campaign had essentially cleaved in two. Top officials who had managed day-to-day activity for Trump up to the election, including in court, say they ceded responsibility to Rudy Giuliani and others, such as Chesebro, according to congressional testimony transcripts. Roman effectively switched teams to work under Giuliani’s structure, according to the testimony from Morgan and others. A spokesperson for Giuliani did not reply to a request for comment. ‘It really went south on me’ Chesebro told Michigan investigators that his own emails show that Morgan remained deeply involved, including in the final hours before January 6, to ensure that the certificates reached DC. “I don’t have a really warm feeling toward, at least, the top Trump lawyers that did this, hid from me what they were doing and then lied to Congress about me. So, it’s been really difficult,” Chesebro said. In his congressional testimony, Morgan said he knew of the elector plan but wanted to distance himself from the effort, delegating the work to others, including those under Giuliani. Morgan told the January 6 committee last year that he initially believed the electors were only meant to be used as a contingency. The electors, he believed, should meet in their state capitals and cast their electoral votes but “not necessarily submit” the certificates to Congress unless “we prevailed” in court. Morgan told the committee that the plan changed in December, saying it morphed from a “cast-and-hold” operation and had “shifted to cast-and-send.” And that’s when Morgan told the committee that he backed out, testifying that he directed an aide to “email Mr. Chesebro politely to say, ‘this is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward.’” “This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero,” Morgan told the committee, later adding that he “moved on” after that email was sent. Morgan explained that he was concerned that the new plan to try to count the fake electors on January 6 “would make the Vice President’s life harder, and I didn’t want to be a part of that.” “Mr. Morgan stands by his congressional testimony,” his defense attorneys told CNN in response to his emails and Chesebro’s statements to investigators. Ultimately, on the eve of the joint session of Congress, Morgan helped get the ballots in place, according to the emails and according to Chesebro, who blamed his legal troubles squarely on the Trump campaign’s legal team. “I could have avoided all this,” Chesebro vented to Michigan prosecutors. “It’s been a real lesson in not working with people that you don’t know and are not sure you can trust, because it really went south on me.” CNN’s Avery Lotz, Annie Klingenberg, Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.

    "text": "Tesla gerät in Rückstand: Wichtiges System schwächelt massiv – „Tickende Zeitbombe“\nTesla glänzte einst mehr als heute. Die Marke ringt mit Imageverlusten und rückläufigen Zahlen. Ein Gutachten belegt ernsthafte Defizite bei der Einparkhilfe.\nBerlin – Nach seinem Bruch mit US-Präsident Donald Trump nahm sich Tesla-Chef Elon Musk vor, sich mehr der Automarke zu widmen. Das wird nach den Imageverlusten und Rückgängen auch bitter nötig sein. Beim Einparken setzt der Tesla-Chef auf Kameras: Das Assistenzsystem Tesla Vision zeigt allerdings gravierende Schwächen beim Einparken auf, wie aus einem Gutachten hervorgeht.\nTesla in der Kritik: Einparkhilfe laut Gutachten fehleranfällig\nOffenbar gibt es Anzeichen, wie sehr die Einparkhilfe schwächelt. Verschiedenen Prüfern zufolge ist Tesla Vision wesentlich fehleranfälliger als Konkurrenzprodukte. Im Vergleich mit Massenmarken wie Peugeot oder Škoda liegt Tesla ziemlich weit zurück. „Das Konzept von Tesla, nur auf Kameras zu setzen, ist eine tickende Zeitbombe im Straßenverkehr“, sagte Christoph Lindner, Anwalt von Tesla-Besitzern, dem Spiegel.\nDie Teslas mit Kamerasystemen, die die Gutachter in Deutschland untersuchten, hatten Probleme teilweise Kartons oder Fahrradträger zu erkennen. Laut dem Spiegel tauchten Warnungen vor Gefahren auf und verschwanden willkürlich wieder. Gegenstände wurden von der Kamera als undefinierbare Wolke angezeigt und verschwanden oder wurden überhaupt nicht erkannt: sogar ein frontal vor dem Auto sitzendes Kind.\nZum Vergleich: Der Peugeot habe stets zuverlässigere Ergebnisse geliefert, Teslas Einparkhilfe dagegen sei „als nicht ausreichend funktionstüchtig zu beurteilen“, schreibt der Gutachter. In dem Fall wurde ein nur mit Kameras ausgestattetes Tesla Model 3 mit demselben Modell des US-Herstellers verglichen, das auch mit Ultraschallsensoren ausgestattet ist.\nTesla kämpft mit Imageproblemen – nach Streit mit Trump kündigt Musk Robotaxi-Dienst an\nKeine erfreuliche Bilanz für Musk. Auch gegenüber seinen Robotaxis gibt es jetzt schon Skepsis. Noch im Juni soll der Robotaxi-Dienst an den Start gehen. Der Starttermin (22. Juni 2025) könne allerdings noch verschoben werden, da Tesla selbst „paranoid“ sei, was die Sicherheit angehe, schrieb Musk bei der Online-Plattform X. Zum 28. Juni wolle Tesla zudem ein in Austin gebautes Fahrzeug des Typs Model Y dem Käufer fahrerlos direkt vor die Tür liefern, schrieb Musk weiter.\nRund eineinhalb Monate vor dem angekündigten Start eines Robotaxi-Dienstes von Tesla hat die US-Verkehrssicherheitsbehörde noch jede Menge Fragen. Die NHTSA will vom Elektroauto-Hersteller unter anderem wissen, wie sich die Fahrzeuge in Notsituationen verhalten sollen und wie Tesla zu dem Schluss kam, dass die Robotaxi-Software bereit zum Einsatz auch ohne Menschen am Steuer ist. Der von Tech-Milliardär Elon Musk geführte Konzern hat bis zum 19. Juni Zeit für eine Antwort.\nTesla in der Krise: Rückgänge belasten Musk und seine Marke\nZuletzt hatte ein Rückgang bei den Verkäufen neuer Tesla-Fahrzeuge in mehreren europäischen Ländern die Aktie des Unternehmens belastet. Tesla verkaufte im Mai 2025 in Ländern wie Schweden, Dänemark, Spanien und Frankreich 19 bis 68 Prozent weniger Neuwagen, wie Zulassungsdaten zeigen. In Norwegen hingegen legten die Verkäufe laut dem Branchenverband OFV um 213 Prozent zu. Besonders gefragt waren dabei Fahrzeuge des zuletzt aktualisierten Model Y, deren Verkäufe von 690 auf 2346 Fahrzeuge stiegen. „Teslas starker Auftritt in Norwegen zeigt, wohin der Weg für das Unternehmen führen sollte: Innovation“, sagte Ben Nelmes vom Analysehaus New AutoMotive. „Kein Autobauer kann sich auf seinen Lorbeeren ausruhen.“\nKäufer in weiten Teilen Europas können die neue Version des Model Y bereits bestellen. Auf den Tesla-Websites in Deutschland, Großbritannien, Frankreich und Italien heißt es jedoch, dass die Auslieferungen erst in diesem Monat starten sollen. Diese Verkäufe sind daher noch nicht in den Absatzzahlen enthalten. Ob Musk beim autonomen Fahren weiterhin die Nase vorne behalten kann, steht in den Sternen. (bohy mit material von reuters)",

    "text": "A Delaware children’s pastor has been arrested on child pornography charges, the Delaware Attorney General’s Office announced Friday.\nJames Dryden, 74, was charged with 10 counts of child pornography possession after a state investigation found that Dryden had downloaded child sexual abuse material. Authorities were initially alerted by Microsoft-generated CyberTips that Dryden’s IP address had accessed the explicit content, and they found more pornographic material when they searched his house.\n“The evidence in this investigation is deeply disturbing,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said. “Nothing is more important than protecting our kids.”\nDryden was a children’s pastor with Stein Highway Church of God in Seaford, Delaware, for more than 20 years. He is not charged with contacting any children and the Attorney General’s Office said they did not know of any victims from his church, but urged the public to come forward with any information “given the nature of Dryden’s work and the fact that it brought him into regular contact with children.”\nDryden, who was arrested Feb. 15, does not appear on Stein Highway’s staff page on its website.\nDryden is being held on $500,000 bail at a Sussex County corrections facility.\nThe post Delaware Children’s Pastor Hit With 10 Counts of Child Porn appeared first on The Daily Beast .",

And the problem is that the infrastructure of the village can't cope with any more traffic. There's a certain section of the village where you've got to go single file, where the school is.\n\"It's on a T-junction, and we can't even get a crossing on the school. So the extra traffic and the workload for the solar farm is going to be colossal.\"\nNoting the proximity of the planned site to the village's primary school, Gardener stressed that his own daughter is \"scared\" of the site being so close to her school.\nGardener said: \"Where the battery storage units are going to be, it's just far too close to the school. There's two lithium battery storage units that they want to put in and cater for the 266 acre site, it's ridiculous.\n\"My daughter is scared, to be honest with you. And the problem is, because it's such a small school, they don't have playing fields - they've got to go across the road into the football pitches. They're worried, they don't know what's going to happen. Nobody's come to speak to the kids at the school.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\nThe site would be just yards from the village's primary school\nYouTube\nWhen asked by host Martin Daubney if there was a \"consultation process\", Gardener claimed there was a meeting with \"PR people\" for the company, but they were given \"no real answers\".\nGardener explained: \"We haven't had any risk assessments, we've had no information whatsoever. There was an information evening and there was just PR people there, there was nobody there from any of the energy companies, so we couldn't get any real answers.\n\"There should be people going into the school and saying this is what's proposed, this is the safety factors, and just explain things to the kids because they don't understand it. And as parents, we don't really understand it, so it's just mental. It's just crazy. It's just preposterous.\"\nHitting out at the drive for net zero pushed by the Labour Government, Gardener claimed they are trying to \"jump on the bandwagon\", and local authorities are \"scared to say no to green\".\nGardener concluded: \"Part of the problem is everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon, and that the councils are so scared to say no to green. They're letting everything go, and everybody's trying to get a piece of that pie.\nGardener told GB News that the plans are 'preposterous'\nGB News\n\"I'm all for renewable energy and green energy, but why take any more of our countryside? Our countryside has been lost enough to like new houses, housing developments, so why can't they put it on the put the solar panels on the new houses?\"\nHe added: \"They're not taking into account anybody's neighbourhoods, anybody's lifestyles, they just think net zero. Net zero, let's do it, let's do it. And the aftermath is going to be phenomenal, because these solar farms are huge. And what happens to the panels after that? How green are they?\"\nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"We are helping builders get shovels in the ground quicker to build the vital infrastructure we need, so we can improve transport links and make Britain a clean energy superpower to protect bill payers.\n\"Our Planning and Infrastructure Bill will deliver a win-win for the economy and nature – fixing the failing system we inherited which has blocked economic growth while doing nothing for nature’s recovery.\"",

    "title": "Mon Laferte se sincera sobre su historia de abuso, adicciones y cáncer: \"Fui violada a los 7 años, a los 11 empecé a tomar\"",
    "text": "La famosa cantautora de ‘Tu falta de querer’, conocida artísticamente como Mon Laferte, compartió una carta donde además de narrar su historia como parte de la escena musical actual, confesó algunos hechos traumáticos que vivió durante su infancia, juventud y adultez.\nA través de redes sociales, la cantante originaria de Viña del Mar, Chile, publicó un video testimonial con algunas de las obras de la exposición ‘Te amo. Mon Laferte Visual’, mismas que acompañaron un escrito en el que le abrió su corazón a sus más de 4 millones de seguidores.\nLa compositora de 41 años comenzó su declaración cuestionando el papel de los artistas en la industria musical, para después confesar que si hubiera regido su carrera con los dogmas establecidos “estaría muerta”.\n“Yo no fui a la universidad y no tengo título de artista ni de catedrática ni de ná, pero la necesidad te enseña a ser más creativa, arreglártelas y a no pedir permiso, ¿se imaginan hubiera pedido permiso? Yo estaría muerta”, señaló.\nSin embargo, diversas mujeres mostraron su apoyo incondicional a Laferte, luego de que confesó que fue abusada en diferentes etapas de su vida, comenzando desde que era una niña.\n“Fui violada a los 7 años, a los 11 empecé a tomar, fumar cigarro y consumir marihuana, probé la pasta base a los 13, estudié en la D.320, almorzaba en la escuela y solo llegué a octavo básico”, mencionó.\nEn la carta, también relató que volvió a sufrir agresiones perpetradas por su manager y no frenaron hasta que cumplió la mayoría de edad.\n“Empecé a trabajar a los 13 años y desde esa edad hasta los 18 fui abusada por un tipo 20 años mayor que yo, quien me vendía como mi manager; él se quedaba con la mitad de la plata. Durante ese tiempo canté en la calle, en bares, en las micros, en circos”, agregó.\nSin embargo, tal como lo relató la intérprete de ‘Mi Buen Amor’ por medio de Instagram, los abusos dentro de la industria continuaron cuando encontró una oportunidad en televisión, ya que el productor la tocó sin su consentimiento.\n“Durante los 5 años que estuve en la tele fui acosada por un productor musical, me besaron a la fuerza varias veces y me trataron de put* sin talento, me la creí y aguanté por necesidad, pero finalmente tuve el valor y me fui”, señaló.\nMon Laferte en polémica por exposición en su honor\nLa carta en la que los fans pudieron adentrarse a la historia de vida de Mon Laferte, surgió después de que 500 artistas independientes firmaron un documento para manifestarse en contra de su exposición ‘Te amo. Mon Laferte Visual’ que se presenta en el Parque Cultural de Valparaíso en Chile.\nEl colectivo señaló que el espacio utilizado por “figuras del espectáculo” los desplazó de la escena artística del país y cuestionaron si existía favoritismo con los artistas de renombre, ante ello, Laferte contó su vida y la forma en la que logró llegar a la fama después de atravesar diversas crisis.\n“Es verdad que hoy tengo un lugar privilegiado, me volví una burguesa, una nueva rica y sé que no pertenezco y nunca voy a pertenecer porque yo siempre voy a ser una flaite y ahora una flaite famosa”, señaló después de afirmar que después de 8 discos publicados se sigue sintiendo como “una intrusa”.\nLa compositora, después de contar su historia de vida desde los 7 años hasta que se convirtió en un referente musical, aseguró que no se va a disculpar por utilizar su propio espacio.\n“Yo no ando queriendo ocupar el espacio de nadie, pero tampoco voy a andar disculpándome por ocupar el mío. Aquí tienen mi historia y ¿saben qué? si esto se trata de meritocracia, entonces yo me lo merezco todo”, señaló.\nMon Laferte intentó quitarse la vida y tuvo cáncer\nLa cantante chilenomexicana reveló que intentó terminar con su vida en dos ocasiones, además de que sufrió problemas de adicciones durante su trayectoria profesional, mismos que le impidieron alimentarse por sí misma debido a la abstinencia.\n“Tuve depresión, me intenté matar dos veces, he sido alcohólica, me tuvieron que dar comida en la boca por los temblores de la abstinencia, no podía ni vestirme sola. Pero a las dos semanas me paré y volví a trabajar, empastillada y aún con depresión, me levanté”, señaló.\nAdemás, puntualizó en su diagnóstico de cáncer de tiroides y la forma en la que siguió adelante con efectos adversos, como perder la voz y tener que aprender a cantar nuevamente.\n“Tuve cáncer de tiroides. Me operaron en el sistema público de salud, quedé con una parálisis facial y no pude mover el lado derecho de mi cuerpo por dos meses. Aún esto me pasa la cuenta, no siento la cara de mi lado derecho”, agregó.\nForma parte de nuestro canal en WhatsApp. ¡VIVE USA ya está disponible!
