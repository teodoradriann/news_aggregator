Kentucky is outside the viewing line for auroras appearing Friday night, Oct. 11, according to NOAA.\nNational Weather Service of Louisville meteorologist Brian Schoettmer said the severe geomagnetic storm is at a G-3, which is categorized as a quiet aurora, according to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).\nSchoettmer said there is a chance people in Southern Indiana and Central Kentucky might see the auroras on Friday, but the chances are not as likely as they were on Thursday evening. He said the forecast calls for clear skies which can help with viewing.\nWhat is a severe geomagnetic storm? During a solar storm, an explosion of particles, energy, radiation and other matter can be blasted like a shotgun toward Earth by a solar flare. This material, called a coronal mass ejection (CME) can take 3-5 days to reach our planet, according to NASA . When it does, the CME can interfere with Earth's magnetic field, creating what experts call a geomagnetic storm.\nThese storms, depending on their strength, can interfere with radio waves and cause power outages. But they also produce beautiful auroras as Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere shields us from the worst of the geomagnetic storm.\nTips for viewing the northern lights Experts say the best auroras are usually within an hour or two of midnight (between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time). These hours expand towards evening and morning as the level of geomagnetic activity increases. There may be aurora in the evening and morning, but it is usually not as active and therefore, not as visually appealing, according to NOAA.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "Tyler resident Lillie Walton came by The Salvation Army in Tyler on Tuesday afternoon to donate blankets and socks she and her church collected.\n“We were just wanting to reach out and help,” said Walton, who is a member at Liberty Baptist Church.\nWalton is a former city government worker and enjoys finding ways to give back. She led the efforts for her church to organize and collect donations. Among the donations, there were four full-size blankets, 12 fleece throws, eight pairs of ladies socks, nine pairs of men’s socks and two extra-large men’s underwear.\n“I know the help is needed and this time of year it’s really needed,” Walton emphasized. “We have more homeless people than I even realized. Since I’ve retired, I’ve just been kind of looking around, when I drive around in this area… but I’ve never seen so many homeless people as [there are] now.”\nThe population of people experiencing homelessness in Smith County has increased, according to the latest statistics. In 2023, there were 328 people experiencing homelessness, according to the 2023 Point-in-Time Count Report for Smith County. This is an increase from 2022, when the number was 262. In Gregg County, there were 150 people experiencing homelessness in 2023, according to the 2023 PIT Count.\nThe PIT count is a count of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. The 2024 count is coming up this month.\n“In Tyler, in general, and even in Longview … we’ve seen an influx of the homeless population compared to last year from different age groups as well,” said Jason Brandon, Director of Tyler Ministries at\nHiway 80 Rescue Mission. ”Unfortunately the homeless population is not going away.”\nLocal organizations depend on the generosity of people like Walton. In the winter, PATH (People Attempting to Help) and The Salvation Army in Tyler both collect blankets to give to people who need them. PATH had fewer blankets in reserves this year, so the local nonprofit is in need of donations to distribute blankets to those in need. It also accepts monetary donations so it can purchase blankets through a supplier at a cheaper cost, according to PATH Executive Director Andrea Wilson-Lobaugh.\nSalvation Army in Tyler to open inclement weather shelter, warming station\nThe Salvation Army needs more adult blankets, said Trevesia Chevis, manager of social services at Salvation Army. Gateway to Hope in Tyler, part of Hiway 80 Rescue Mission, has jackets, gloves and scarves for people who come in. They are also a\nwarming station.\nAs\nwintry weather approaches next week, the Salvation Army has opened as a shelter for those who need to escape the cold. They have cots with blankets and pillows. In the social services building, one room can fit about 20 cots, in another room they can fit 4 to 5 cots. In the Women’s and Children’s Auxiliary, they can fit 200. Women are kept upstairs separate from the men. During regular winter months, they also are a warming station during their office hours. The foyer has seating where people can warm up and drink water. They also have jackets and gloves they can provide.\n“Our staff is always ready because we are an emergency shelter, we have to be prepared and what goes with that for the inclement weather is that we make sure that we do have the cots ready, blankets and extra pillows and things like that,” Chevis said. “[We] make sure that we tell the kitchen to increase the meals because we also feed the community.”\nThe Salvation Army requires photo IDs for anyone coming into their facilities. They also do a background check and those with sexual offenses on their records cannot come in. However once temperatures go below 10s, they do it on a case-by-case basis, according to Chevis.\nAt PATH, people come in to seek resources during winter months as electricity bills increase. They offer utilities assistance. In order to help residents, PATH needs a letter saying service will be disconnected. PATH can help a family once per year. In addition they give out blankets, one per family per year and once for year for anyone who is homeless. They use donations and funds dedicated to blankets to buy blankets which allows them to buy it at a cheaper rate. One employee tested the quality of blankets to make sure they would maintain heat without electricity, according to Wilson-Lobaugh.\nMany of the people coming in during winter months are people who are struggling. During the day they get elderly people who are on a fixed income. Later in the day, they will notice mothers with their kids who came after school. They also notice an increase in people visiting the food pantry, Wilson-Lobaugh said.\n“We have so many families who are living paycheck to paycheck just to make ends meet and that they have an unexpected expense of $150 because they get to replace a tire in their car back and forth to work,” Wilson-Lobaugh said. “That’s the difference from being able to pay the rent. Because that’s how close they are. They don’t have the luxury of putting money back into sight.”\nThe Tyler Street Team works hands on with the homeless community. On Saturdays, they are at Church Under the Bridge, organized by Hunger for Love. In addition Tyler Street Team hands out beanies, hand warmers and socks. They also help people through their hotline (903-253-0301) and place people in hotels. They have two or three zero-rated sleeping bags and three or four heated vests so those who have nowhere to go can stay warm, Tyler Street Team Executive Director Shana Yeatts said.\nThrough their work on the ground, Tyler Street Team volunteers know who the people are who need these items.\nPATH will be closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. However Gateway to Hope will be open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday. They will resume their normal hours, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday. In addition to being a warming center, Gateway to Hope helps those experiencing homelessness by offering snacks, providing a place to shower and a place to do laundry.\nSmith County, City of Tyler weather response plan guides public on preparedness as winter weather approaches\n“We can’t do what we do without the help of our community and we definitely want the homeless safe during this weather and we’re committed to do what we can to help them,” Brandon said. “If anyone finds themselves on the street or homeless or without adequate heating during the threat of snow and ice, they can find themselves at Gateway and we can help them the best we can.”\nNWS warns of wintry mix in East Texas; freezing rain, sleet expected City of Tyler monitoring winter weather conditions Ciudad de Tyler monitorea las condiciones de tiempo invernal",

Cleveland Browns [clasificó a NFL Playoffs](https://www.tudn.com/nfl/asi-se-juegan-playoffs-nfl-2023-momento-rumbo-super-bowl-lviii) al vencer este jueves a 37-20 a New York Jets en el inicio de la Semana 17 de la NFL. Browns regresa a una postemporada tres años después de la última vez que avanzaron en 2020 y por tercera vez desde el 2000, la otra ocasión fue en el 2022. Joe Flacco nuevamente tuvo un gran partido en el emparrillado con más de 300 yardas por aire, tres pases de touchdowns y solo una intercepción. El experimentado quarterback encontró en par de ocasiones en las diagonales a Jerome Ford y una vez a Elijah Moore. Browns se fue al descanso con 34 puntos en la bolsa, gracias a otra anotación de Kareem Hunt en la vía terrestre. Tan solo en el primer cuarto Cleveland iba arriba 20-7 y en el segundo cuarto aumentó la ventaja con un parcial de 14-10 sobre Jets, que se mantuvo en el juego gracias a su defensiva. New York con Trevor Siemian en los controles, lanzó 242 yardas con un touchdown y una intercepción. El corredo Breece Hall tuvo 84 yardas por tierra y añadió 42 por aire con una anotación. El tercer cuarto no tuvo puntos para ninguno de los dos equipos y el cuarto periodo estuvo en un intercambio de posesiones gracias al buen trabajo de las defensivas que las ofensivas no pudieron aprovechar.",

    "text": "- Ligue des nations - Résumé Le Portugal démarre bien contre la Croatie, l’Espagne au ralenti en Serbie Et c’est reparti pour un tour ! Ce jeudi marquait le coup d’envoi de la quatrième édition de la Ligue des nations. Du côté de Lisbonne, le Portugal a su faire rapidement la différence pour prendre le meilleur sur une Croatie qui ne s’avoue jamais vaincue. La Seleçao trouve rapidement la faille grâce à Diogo Dalot, parfaitement trouvé dans la surface par Bruno Fernandes. Le break ne peut ensuite venir que de Cristiano Ronaldo, [qui continue d’écrire sa légende](https://www.sofoot.com/breves/cristiano-ronaldo-inscrit-son-900e-but-en-carriere-lors-de-portugal-croatie), tandis que la remise de Borna Sosa déviée dans ses propres filets par Dalot reste sans conséquences. Une victoire inaugurale qui place les Portugais en tête de ce groupe 1, à hauteur de la Pologne. Cette dernière s’est en effet imposée sur le fil en Ecosse grâce à un penalty de Nicola Zalewski, alors que la Tartan Army avait remonté deux buts de retard en seconde période. 🇵🇹🇭🇷 Le 131e but de Cristiano Ronaldo avec le Portugal !

    "text": "The New York Mets are considered World Series favorites after shelling out a record-breaking $765 million contract for generational superstar Juan Soto .\nBeyond the Soto splash, they brought back homegrown All-Star Pete Alonso on a two-year deal, re-signed left-handed starter Sean Manaea , bolstered their pitching staff with Clay Holmes and Frankie Montas , and solidified their bullpen with A.J. Minter.\nThe Mets already boast one of the best lineups in the league. Along with Soto and Alonso, they feature 2024 MVP runner-up Francisco Lindor , Mark Vientos, and Brandon Nimmo. Francisco Alvarez, another key piece, will start the season on the injured list while recovering from a broken hamate bone in his left hand.\nAfter their surprise run to the NLCS where they were dispatched by the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers , the Mets now have the fifth-best odds of winning the title themselves, according to DraftKings .\nWith such high expectations, is it World Series or bust for the Mets? A team analyst is sharing his perspective.\nNew York Mets analyst reveals 2025 win total In an interview with Sporstnaut’s “The Deferrals” baseball podcast , Mets On SI contributor and “Mets Daily” host Jake Brown said the goal is the World Series, but the season won’t be a failure if they don’t win a championship in Year One of the Soto Era.\n“Is it World Series or bust? Not exactly. I think that’s the goal. I think that’s a realistic goal because, listen, if you could take down the Dodgers in a best of seven, there’s no question they could beat anyone from the American League,” stated Brown.\nBrown told “The Deferrals” that the Mets will need to stay healthy and add an arm to a rotation that’s already dealing with injuries to Montas and Manaea.\n“If they stay healthy and add someone to the rotation, I think they can compete for a title. I won’t call it World Series or bust. If they missed the playoffs, that’s a disgrace. I mean, that’s the bare minimum, where last year it was compete for the playoffs,” Brown added.\n“This year is, at least, get to the playoffs and then try to take down the Dodgers. That’s the goal. I’m encouraged. I think at the minimum this is a 90-win team. If everything goes bad, 85 at the worst. But I think this team should win anywhere between 90 and 95 games.”\nThe battle in the National League East promises to be fierce, with the Mets having to contend with powerhouse rivals in the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies . According to DraftKings, the Braves and Phillies currently have the second- and fourth-best odds to win the World Series, respectively.\nThe Mets haven’t been to the World Series since 2015, when they lost to the Kansas City Royals in five games.",
