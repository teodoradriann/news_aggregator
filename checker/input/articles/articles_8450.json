    "text": "La meta de plantar 32 mis árboles durante los 3 años de la presente administración fue rebasada y reportaron un total de 41 mil 395 ejemplares sembrados de distintas especies y tamaños en toda la ciudad. Ale Gutiérrez, presidenta municipal, aseguró que la siembre de árboles es parte estratégica de la administración y señaló que los árboles plantados tienen una garantía de vida, además de su tamaño y capacidad de sobrevivir al ser endémicos del ambiente. “Vamos a dejar a León con muchos más arboles que como lo recibimos, un León con más arbolado que ayude al medio ambiente, que ayude a la temperatura de esta ciudad, más árboles que hagan que la gente se sienta mejor. “Hoy les queremos decir que ya tenemos más de 41 mil árboles, pero no son árboles chiquitos, son árboles que ya tienen un avance, son de 2, 3 o hasta 5 años de vida y se están plantando en varias zonas y se puede ver la diferencia”— Ale Gutiérrez, alcaldesa de León [En este 2024 la meta es plantar 10 mil ejemplares, 6 mil en la zona urbana y 4 mil en la zona rural](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/guanajuato/2024/06/23/plantan-600-arboles-en-un-solo-dia-en-toda-la-ciudad-la-meta-es-llegar-a-10-mil-arboles-endemicos/); al día de hoy se han forestado 7 mil 510 árboles, por lo que con apoyo de la ciudadanía se estima superar la meta y llegar a los 16 mil 310 árboles en 2024. Siembra masiva este fin de semana en Sierra de Lobos El encargado de despacho de Medio Ambiente, Pablo Michael García Cardiel, agradeció a todas las personas que -a través de la campaña ‘Plántale’- participarán en la forestación masiva que se realizará este sábado 20 de julio en Sierra de Lobos. Cada semana la dirección de Medio Ambiente, acude a un parque o espacio público para invitar a la ciudadanía a que los apoye en plantar árboles, por ello las personas que deseen adquirir un ejemplar o planta pueden acercarse también al vivero municipal para recibirlo. De enero a julio se han donado 6 mil 310 árboles y 44 mil 978 plantas. Los requisitos para solicitar un ejemplar son: solicitud, carta compromiso, INE, comprobante de domicilio, ubicación, fotos y medidas donde será plantado el árbol o planta. Además de los más de 42 mil árboles plantados en esta administración, también se han salvado 30 mil 405 que estaban dañados por plagas como muérdago y cúscuta, lo cual ha sido posible gracias a las 14 cuadrillas de limpieza que se tienen en las 7 delegaciones y el personal capacitado para lograr rescatar estos árboles.",

    "text": "Government pledges £22bn for carbon capture and storage technology in net zero drive The £22bn funding for carbon capture and storage has been welcomed as a lifeline for some industry jobs. The expensive technology is regarded as critical to reaching UK climate targets, but green groups warn the wrong use risks prolonging dependence on fossil fuels. Friday 4 October 2024 12:40, UK The government has pledged nearly £22bn to fund projects that capture greenhouse gases from polluting plants and store them underground, as it races to reach strict climate targets. The plans are designed to generate private investment and jobs in Merseyside and Teesside, two industry-heavy areas that will be home to the new \"carbon capture clusters\". Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News \"today a new era begins\", with a new industry that stops carbon going into the atmosphere providing \"good jobs\" and shows the government is investing in the country. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the move was \"reigniting our industrial heartlands by investing in the industry of the future\", though there are questions about how best to use this expensive technology. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) has been developed to combat climate change. It captures the planet-warming carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels or from heavy industry, and puts it to use or stores it underground. It is expensive and difficult, but the UK's climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), and United Nations scientists say it is essential to get the world to net zero, which the UK is targeting for 2050. Net zero means cutting emissions as much as possible and offsetting or capturing the stubborn remaining ones. Today the government has committed up to £21.7bn over 25 years, to be given in subsidies to sites in the Teesside and Merseyside \"clusters\" - from 2028. [Analysis: After warning of tightened purse strings, the public may well be perplexed by Reeves](https://news.sky.com/story/after-warning-of-tightened-purse-strings-the-public-may-well-be-perplexed-by-reeves-13227383) It will be split between three projects, which are capturing carbon dioxide released either from making hydrogen, generating gas power or burning waste to create energy from 2028. The gas - up to 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions - will be locked away in empty gas fields in the Liverpool Bay and the North Sea. The government hopes it will attract £8bn in private investment, create 4,000 direct jobs and support a further 50,000. The cash will pay for fewer projects than hoped - the last government suggested a £20bn pot of money for similar projects - but the new administration says those plans weren't properly costed, and the funding hadn't been allocated. The funding is to come from a mixture of Treasury money and energy bills, but the government has been coy about the split so far. Sir Keir said the announcement will \"give industry the certainty it needs\" and \"help deliver jobs, kickstart growth, and repair this country once and for all\". How about the £22bn black hole? The £21.7bn the government has committed to the project is notably about the same amount as the £22bn black hole Labour says the Conservative government left it with. But, Sir Keir insisted the carbon capture and storage scheme \"will unlock billions of private investment\" and is certain he will soon be announcing more private investment. Defending some unpopular decisions the government has made in its first three months, such as cutting the winter fuel payment for 10 million pensioners, Sir Keir added: \"I'm absolutely convinced that only by stabilising the economy can we attract the investment that we need.\" Will CCUS help jobs and business? The government hopes to fund the first large-scale hydrogen production plant in the UK, and help the oil and gas sector and its transferable skills move over to green industries. It has been welcomed by industry and the unions, coming just a week after job losses from [the closures of Port Talbot Steelworks and Ratcliffe coal power station](https://news.sky.com/story/how-the-end-of-coal-in-the-uk-and-closure-of-port-talbot-steelworks-are-related-13225486). GMB general secretary Gary Smith said the news \"shows what levelling up can really mean: good, well-paid jobs reinvigorating communities\". Does carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) work? CCUS has made slow progress: promised for decades but barely scaled, with just 45 commercial sites globally, according to the International Energy Agency. However, it began to pick up in the last few years, with 700 plants now in some stage of development around the world. The world's first CCUS plant has stored CO2 under Norway's waters since 1996, though elsewhere a few concerns linger about whether some projects leak gas. James Richardson, acting chief executive of the CCC, said: \"We can't hit the country's targets without CCUS, so this commitment to it is very reassuring\". [ ](/download-app) Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free How should CCUS be used? Some believe expensive CCUS should be preserved for areas like cement or lime production, that are very hard to clean up in any other way, whereas greener alternatives exist for things like blue hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is clean when burned but made from natural gas, so requires ongoing imports of the fossil fuel. Greenpeace UK's Doug Parr warned of a \"risk of locking ourselves into second-rate solutions, especially as the oil industry could easily hoover up most of the money to continue business as usual\". The government hopes this funding for the three sites that are ready to go will lay the foundations for further CCUS projects.",

Naqash Abbasi (right) was the alleged organizer, according to the Crown. (Peel Regional Police - image credit)\nAfter four weeks in court, the Crown has presented its final evidence in the trial of three men accused in a Mississauga restaurant shooting three years ago that left one man dead and left four others injured.\nNaim Akl, 25, was killed in the May 29, 2021, attack in a restaurant called Chicken Land that was owned by his family. Akl's mother, father, brother and a family friend were injured.\nJihad Akl, Naim's father, was shot in the chest that night. It was busy at the restaurant when a man burst in and started firing, he testified in Superior Court in Brampton earlier this week.\n\"He shot my son in the front first then he shot my driver.… He shot me, he missed the second shot and it went to my son, Naim,\" Akl told the jury, saying he remembered seeing Naim Akl covered in blood.\n\"Then I saw my wife crying. I didn't know what was happening. I tried to talk to my son, I knew he was not going to make it.\"\nAkl's daughter Sandra, who was 13 at the time, was shot at but escaped uninjured, court heard.\nCrown prosecutors allege the shooting was planned by three men — Anand Nath, Suliman Raza and Naqash Abbasi. All three have pleaded not guilty to one count each of first-degree murder and five counts each of attempted murder.\nNath, from Mississauga, is accused of carrying out the shooting, while Raza, also from Mississauga, was the alleged getaway driver. Abbasi, from Brampton, was the alleged organizer, according to the Crown.\nA heated falling out\nAbbasi made \"significant deletion of data and calls\" from his phone in May 2021, according to an agreed statement of facts that prosecutor Brian McGuire read to the jury as their final piece of evidence in the case.\nProsecutors allege the three men had pledged allegiance to ISIS and were looking to silence Naim Akl because he planned to go to police about their actions.\nNaim Akl, 25, was killed in a shooting at Chicken Land, on Glen Erin Drive and the Collegeway in Mississauga, on May 29, 2021.\nNaim Akl, 25, was killed in a shooting at Chicken Land on Glen Erin Drive and the Collegeway in Mississauga, on May 29, 2021. (Facebook/Canadian Druze Society)\nOver the course of the trial, court heard the three accused worked at a warehouse business called TryAlinc. Naim Akl also worked there until there was a heated falling out and he left the business to work at his family restaurant, a colleague and friend of the victim, Ammar Hashmi, previously testified.\nMikail Aras, who testified last week, said the three accused pressured him to pledge allegiance to ISIS and told him about the murder plot. He also told the jury that Abbasi was sending money made from the business to ISIS.\nWhen asked why no terrorism charges were laid in connection with the case, the Ministry of the Attorney General previously told CBC News it would be inappropriate to comment given the case is still before the courts.\nA 'rapid' death\nCourt also heard from a Montreal Police officer Tuesday who arrested Nath when he turned himself in on June 10, 2021, after a Canada wide-arrest warrant was issued for him.\nNath was carrying a phone charger when he turned himself in but no phone, Const. Alexandra Henry testified.\nProsecutors have exhibited evidence from Raza's and Abbasi's phones throughout the trial.\nPhone records from Abbasi's phones were used by defence lawyers in an attempt to poke holes in the testimony of Aras, who was the Crown's star witness.\nThe jury also saw X-rays of the victim's skull Tuesday, while a forensic pathologist testified Akl was shot in the head and mouth.\nThe injuries caused a \"really rapid death, [taking] seconds,\" Jennifer Dmetrichuk testified.\nDefence lawyers have not brought forward any witnesses.\nCourt resumes on Monday, when the Crown prosecutor and three defence lawyers will make their closing statements.",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "The Mid North Coast is being asked to prepare for the worst-case scenario when it comes to the possible impact of Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\n\"People should know their risk,\" NSW SES Mid North Coast deputy zone commander Tony Day said.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood watch for the Mid North Coast, where moderate to major flooding may develop late on Friday (March 7) afternoon.\nRainfall associated with Tropical Cyclone Alfred may cause rapid river rises along NSW coastal rivers from the Queensland border to Port Macquarie.\n\"It's very unpredictable at this stage, just depending on how fast that rain depression moves along the ranges in that southerly direction but associated with that rain, which presents its own problems, will be the storm surges, high waves and subsequent coastal erosion,\" he said.\nMr Day said the combination of those weather impacts presents the organisation with a \"unique challenge\".\nThere's a possibility people may be cut off from essential services and power, given the associated rainfall and potential flooding predicted when the cyclone makes landfall.\nMr Day is encouraging residents to limit travel over the weekend, to \"hunker down\" and \"ride this out\".\nHe said people shouldn't \"panic buy\" but stock up on essential items, including medications.\nThere's no guarantee, Mr Day said, if the significant impact does eventuate that the NSW SES will be able to respond to every call for assistance.\nIn March 2021, the region was hit by a\nsignificant flooding event, and Mr Day said the organisation is concerned that this event will be similar.\nHowever, he said this time around, there are other issues that may create challenges, including significant storm surges and wave heights.\n\"As that water moves down the catchment and then normally discharges into the sea, this time around, there's going to be a lot of water around pushing it back up again,\" he said.\n\"That's going to exacerbate things for us.\"\nThe location of the heaviest rainfall and most severe flooding will depend on the track of Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\nKey focus areas for the NSW SES Mid North Coast members include the Nambucca area and the Macleay area, including the potential for isolation of South West Rocks, Hat Head and Crescent Heads.\nIn Port Macquarie, Settlement Point, the North Shore, Hastings River Drive and Hibbard areas are likely to be focus points for the organisation.\nMeanwhile, Dunbogan, Logans Crossing and North Haven are key areas of concern in the Camden Haven.\nMembers of the NSW SES are currently door-knocking in those communities to ensure people are prepared for what's to come.\nIt's likely the rainfall will start on Friday, but continue across the weekend.\nThe Albanese and Minns Governments have activated disaster assistance to communities in 15 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Northern NSW in anticipation of the cyclone's impact.\nThe NSW Government's Natural Disaster Declaration applies to the LGAs of: Ballina, Bellingen, Byron, Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Dungog, Kempsey, Kyogle, Lismore, Lord Howe Island, MidCoast, Nambucca Valley, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Richmond Valley and Tweed.\nThe NSW SES advises residents to prepare their homes for strong winds by putting away loose items around their homes, trimming trees away from properties and not parking vehicles under trees or powerlines.\nPrepare an emergency kit with essential items, including identification documents, medications, a torch, a mobile phone charger and a battery-operated radio.\nThe NSW SES is advising people to download the Hazards Near Me App which will include the latest warnings and information for impacted communities.\nIf you need assistance during floods and storms, call the NSW SES on 132 500 or Triple Zero (000) for life-threatening emergencies.\nCatchments listed in the flood watch include:\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",

    "text": "A large number of volunteers from the Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sangam helped devotees visiting the famous Sabarimala shrine by giving them water and biscuits, said the sangam state president M. Viswanathan here on Friday.\nAccording to a press release, due to the limitations, they could not provide Annadhanam to the devotees this season. As per the request from the Special Officer in Sabarimala, the sangam decided to provide herbal water and biscuits to the devotees who waited in long queues and for long hours at the Sannidhanam.\nAlso, the volunteers, who had come to Sabarimala from different parts of Tamil Nadu, helped the children and elderly who required medical assistance. Since the waiting time to climb up the hills and in front of the sanctum sanctorum was very long, the volunteers provided stretcher facilities and among others.\nBiscuits worth ₹8 lakh were distributed during the last 30 days. Scores of devotees were provided free medical treatment by the volunteers, who were supervised by office-bearers, including K. Ayyappan, D. Vijayakumar, N. Rajadurai, C. Ramiah and others. There was a heavy rush at the parking space. This season, many devotees took the Pulmedu route to reach the destination, the release added.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",
