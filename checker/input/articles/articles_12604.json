    "text": "Germany’s Budget Woes: A Comedy of Errors The latest estimates about German tax revenues are as welcome as a cup of lukewarm tea at a freezing winter English picnic! Finance Minister Christian Lindner is tackling a budget draft for 2025, and it seems the only thing he has in surplus is a pile of problems to sort out by mid-November!\nThe Finance Minister’s Dilemma While announcing the latest tax estimates in the cultured chaos of Washington’s IMF and World Bank annual meetings, Lindner conveyed a singular message: “There is no scope for distribution policy.” Sounds a bit like he’s saying, “Eat cake? What cake?” for anyone expecting good news from the tax department!\nTax revenues are projected to hit a paltry 982.4 billion euros in 2025. That’s €12.7 billion less than what the spring forecast promised—because nothing says ‘fun’ like watching your government’s wallet get thinner during a recession. Sebastian Rau reports it like it is—Germany’s economy is wobblier than a two-legged chair!\nThe Friction Within the Coalition The “traffic light coalition” (SPD, Greens , FDP) was meant to shine bright, but it’s turning into a red flame of tension. Lindner is like the kid who demands to control the budget because “that’s how we’ll get the best toys”—except the toys are public services, and nobody’s quite on board with his vision.\nWith a forecast of 389.7 billion euros expected at the federal level, which is basically a potato chip more than the spring’s prediction, Lindner’s still got his hands full! No surprises here—there’s still an urgent need for a whopping €13.5 billion in budget adjustments. Does anyone smell a ‘budget crisis’ coming on?\nMore Debt, More Problems Lucky for him, in true bureaucratic fashion, the German debt brake has a silver lining! The current economic gloom allows for taking on an added 5 billion euros in loans. More debt? Sure, let’s just keep adding to that lovely credit card bill! Meanwhile, Lindner is hoping to use funds meant for a new chip factory to “plug the budget hole.” It’s like shifting around furniture to mask the gaping hole in the floor!\nHowever, it looks like even with all the financial gymnastics, they’re still staring down the barrel of a deficit—something like 9 to 10 billion euros still in need of consolidation. Honestly, if they were any more in debt, Lindner might have to consider selling one of his limbs—or is it just his credibility at this point?\nThe Old “Global Underspending” Tango The “global underspending” conundrum from the last budget is also making a comeback, adding 2.4 billion euros to Lindner’s shopping list of things to apologize for. They’re trying to limit this to a maximum of 2% of federal spending—let’s hope they succeed! Otherwise, it’ll be another round of bungling presentations in the Bundestag, and we all know how much the politicians love a good argument over the nation’s finances!\nWill the Coalition Survive? As discussions heat up, Lindner’s proposals are meeting about as much enthusiasm as a glass of warm milk before bed—essentially, none! And with all the party principles butting heads, there’s speculation about whether the traffic light coalition is still in working order. Spoiler: None of the parties can afford to jump ship, given how low they’re polling. They have to at least pretend to hold it together for now!\nSo, let’s grab some popcorn and watch the budget negotiations unfold this November! After all, nothing says “fun” like politicians fighting over imaginary money. Bravo, Germany! You continue to give us all a good laugh—and a headache, too!\nThe latest estimates of German tax revenues don’t help either: the traffic light coalition has to close a significant hole in the 2025 budget draft by mid-November. The finance minister has a few ideas about this.\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner announces the results of the tax estimate on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. Sebastian Rau / Imago\n“There is no scope for distribution policy. On the contrary, the urgency for an economic policy change is increasing.” With these words, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner addressed a press conference broadcast from Washington on Thursday to introduce the Results of the so-called tax estimate initiated. Twice a year, a working group of experts reassesses the expected tax revenue. His forecasts form a basis for federal, state and local government budget planning.\nWeak economy The experts expect tax revenue of 982.4 billion euros for all three levels in 2025. That is 12.7 billion euros less than estimated in the spring. The decline is mainly explained by the fact that the government now expects a recession this year and weaker economic growth next year. In the current year, tax revenue is likely to remain below previous assumptions.\nThis could increase political tensions in the traffic light coalition made up of the SPD, Greens and FDP with a view to the upcoming adoption of the 2025 federal budget in the Bundestag.\nAt the federal level alone, next year’s revenue is likely to be 389.7 billion euros, a small 0.7 billion euros higher than expected in the spring. This is primarily due to lower payments to the EU budget. But the budgetary needs of “Traffic Light” will not be reduced, especially since this was already priced in. Lindner told the media that there was a “need for action” amounting to 13.5 billion euros compared to the current budget draft.\nMore debt allowed The weak economy is providing some relief. Because the German debt brake allows slightly more debt as part of an economic component when the economic situation is poor, the federal government will be able to take out around 5 billion euros more in loans next year than previously planned. This leeway will have to be used entirely to compensate for the shortfall in economic revenue, said FDP Minister Lindner.\nHe is also demanding that the funds that were intended to subsidize a new chip factory of the US company Intel in Magdeburg, which has now been postponed indefinitely, be used to plug the budget hole instead of being reallocated for other expenses. That would save the budget by 7 billion euros.\nBut even with full use of these two measures, there remains a need for consolidation. Lindner said it was a single-digit billion amount, which would be closer to 10 billion than 1 billion euros. Additional expenses may also arise, including for citizens’ money (social assistance) or the EEG levy (for renewable energies).\nThe Finance Minister is therefore calling for a review of the federal government’s subsidy practices as a whole and for the growth of the welfare state to be limited. Recently he had already suggested corrections to citizens’ money.\nRemnants of an old argument Lindner’s “need for action” also includes 2.4 billion euros left over from a previously unresolved dispute. This is about “global underspending” (GMA), a standard instrument of financial policy. The experience behind this is that never all budgeted expenses are actually paid off, for example because the implementation of projects is delayed.\nHowever, this item has never been as high as in the 2025 budget draft. In August, after a long tug of war, the traffic light government reduced the GMA to 12 billion euros, but this is still considered unrealistically high. Lindner now wants to limit it to a maximum of 2 percent of budgeted federal spending or 9.6 billion euros, which requires a reduction of the aforementioned 2.4 billion euros.\nNext cliff for coalition All of this should be incorporated into the budget discussions in the Bundestag, which will be concluded in mid-November. However, Lindner’s proposals are unlikely to be met with much enthusiasm among the Social Democrats and the Greens. Conversely, the Finance Minister once again rejected their continued calls for the debt brake to be relaxed, suspended or circumvented. He also pointed out again that the new EU fiscal rules would also limit spending growth. According to Lindner, the negotiations between the German Ministry of Finance and the EU Commission regarding the application of the new rules have not yet been completed.\nThis could lead to renewed confrontations within the “traffic light”, especially since the three coalition parties have already been haggling hard over every billion. Given their very different economic policy beliefs, the state budget has always been a kind of breaking point for the traffic light government. This fall, too, there is continued speculation as to whether the coalition will collapse because of the dispute over the budget. What speaks against it: Given the miserable poll numbers, none of the three parties can actually be interested in an early exit.\nYou can contact Berlin business correspondent René Höltschi on the platforms X and Linkedin consequences.\nInterview ⁤with ​Sebastian Rau: ​A Closer Look ⁤at Germany’s Budget ⁤Woes\nEditor: Welcome, ​Sebastian Rau! You’ve been covering the latest⁣ developments in Germany’s budget crisis. Can you ⁢give us a quick‍ overview of ⁣the current situation?\nSebastian Rau: Thanks for having me! Germany​ is facing a rather grim ⁤budget outlook for 2025, with tax revenues expected to drop significantly to ⁢€982.4 billion, which ⁣is about €12.7 billion⁢ less than previously forecasted. Finance Minister Christian Lindner is under ⁣considerable pressure as he ⁤tries to manage a budget draft riddled with challenges, especially amid a looming recession.\nEditor: It sounds like a difficult balancing act. What are‍ the main challenges Lindner is facing‍ within the coalition?\nSebastian Rau: ⁢The “traffic light coalition”—comprising the ‍SPD, Greens, and FDP—is experiencing heightened tensions. Lindner wants to‌ assert control over budget allocations, arguing that it’s⁣ essential for public ‌services. However, there is significant ⁤pushback ‌from the other‌ parties, who have their own ideas about spending priorities. As ‌it stands, Lindner is facing ‍an urgent ‍need to align everyone​ on a strategy that addresses the €13.5 billion budget gap.\nEditor: Interesting metaphor with the “traffic light coalition.”​ And what about the finance‍ minister’s approach to managing​ the deficit? Is he looking‍ at increasing ⁤the national debt?\nSebastian Rau: Exactly! In ​a rather paradoxical twist, the current economic ‌conditions allow Germany to take on an ‍additional €5 billion in loans. Lindner hopes to use ‍funds earmarked for a postponed chip factory to help⁣ fill the gap, but that’s still not enough. Even with these measures, a‍ deficit of approximately €9​ to ​€10 billion remains, ‍which raises questions about​ the sustainability of Germany’s financial policies moving forward.\nEditor: It sounds like the situation could lead to more political drama. What do​ you think will happen during the budget‌ discussions in the Bundestag⁣ this November?\nSebastian Rau: I expect intense debates! Lindner’s proposals have not been particularly ⁣well‍ received, and with all the coalition partners facing poor polling, there’s a‍ desperate need to project unity, even if it’s fraying at the edges. At the ‌end of the day, they ⁣all⁤ have​ a lot to lose if they can’t present a cohesive ⁢front, so ⁢it’ll be fascinating ​to see how they navigate‌ these‌ contentious‍ discussions.\nEditor: ‍ Definitely! ‌Thank you for your insights, Sebastian. It seems we’re in for ‌a show as the negotiations unfold!\nSebastian Rau: Always a‍ pleasure! Let’s hope for a resolution before ‍the popcorn runs out!\nDebt?\nSebastian Rau: Yes, he certainly is! Lindner has found some breathing room under the German debt brake, which allows for additional borrowing in times of economic downturn. He plans to tap into an extra €5 billion in loans, primarily to cover shortfalls in revenue. Moreover, he’s been quite innovative and has proposed reallocating funds initially intended for a new chip factory project to help plug budget gaps. However, even these measures won’t fully close the deficit, which may hover around €9 to €10 billion.\nEditor: So, it sounds like a lot of financial juggling. What about the long-standing debate around “global underspending”? How does that play into the current budget discussions?\nSebastian Rau: The “global underspending” issue is resurfacing and adds about €2.4 billion to Lindner’s to-do list. It’s essentially a safety net reflecting funds that were allocated but not spent, often due to delays in project implementation. Lindner wants to limit this to about 2% of federal spending to avoid confusion and budgetary overreach, which could spark more contention in the coalition discussions.\nEditor: With all these tensions and issues, do you think the traffic light coalition can hold together over these budget negotiations?\nSebastian Rau: It’s a precarious situation. While all parties are wary of losing more ground in the polls, the differing economic philosophies could lead to significant fractures. So far, there’s no appetite for any party to jump ship, but if they can’t find common ground, we might see a serious strain. The negotiations this November will be pivotal for their survival.\nEditor: Thank you, Sebastian! It seems like Germany’s budget woes will provide plenty of drama in the coming weeks. We’ll definitely keep an eye on how this unfolds.\nSebastian Rau: Absolutely! Thanks for having me.",

    "text": "MSP (Multi Source Power) Technologies provided a 3MWh BESS for one of Glastonbury’s most well-known stages, Arcadia. Image: MSP Technologies. Battery storage technology well and truly arrived at this year’s edition of Glastonbury, the world’s largest music and arts festival, helping power numerous parts including the Arcadia stage.\nThe five-day, 210,000-capacity event claims to be entirely powered by clean energy sources, including the flagship Gusty Spinfield pink and purple wind turbine deployed by utility Octopus Energy.\nMuch of that power comes from generators running on HVO biofuels but many are integrated with battery storage units as backup, according to Progen Power, while a megawatt-scale solution powered one of the festival’s most well-known spectacles.\nMSP Technologies: 1MW/3MWh BESS for Arcadia stage MSP (Multi Source Power) Technologies provided a pre-charged battery energy storage system (BESS) to utility Ecotricity to power the Arcadia stage, which featured DJ sets from Fatboy Slim, Hot Chip and Eric Prydz from inside the head of a giant metal dragonfly structure, pictured above.\n“(Ecotricity CEO) Dale Vince was convinced he could help to decarbonise the festival environment so commissioned us to construct the BESS, specifically for festival or portable power needs. The stage and BESS are a phenomenal achievement,” MSP CEO Simon Patterson told Energy-Storage.news.\nThe 1MW/3MWh BESS covered the load during the three days of performances as well as the five pre-show days with the help of HVO biofuels and a solar array for charging. It comprised six blocks with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells from Hithium and power conversion systems (PCS) from EPC Power.\nDuring the show loads jumped from below 250kW to over 720kW, sometimes in the course of 20 milliseconds, something that Patterson said generators would struggle with.\n“The power quality compared to a generator is chalk and cheese. If you tried those loads steps with a generator you’d see them coughing black smoke. The deviation in frequency was never more than 100th of a hertz and never more than 1.8V,” he said.\n“The carbon reductions from using the BESS were massive but the biggest thing was just the quietness on site, outside of show hours. The ground team were really excited about having the BESS there as they are trying to be as eco-friendly as possible.”\nThe BESS is doing more festivals this summer, including Womad and a Massive Attack show, and MSP has aspirations to do many more next year alongside Glastonbury, Patterson added.\nThe BESS that powered the Arcadia set. Image: MSP Technologies. Allye: portable BESS units Startup Allye provided its portable BESS units in partnership with partner Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). Some 25 of JLR’s Defender hybrid EV Range Rovers were used at the site and Allye’s BESS helped keep them charged. Allye’s units use second life EV batteries and have a storage capacity of 270kWh per unit.\nSpeaking to Energy-Storage.news, Jonathan Carrier, cofounder and CEO of Allye said: “Allye is delighted to see the MAX deployed at Glastonbury by JLR, to support charging of its vehicles. It demonstrates the flexibility of the system across a range of applications for JLR, from events to prototype testing.”\n“The MAX is a highly versatile energy storage system that Glastonbury could use for sustainable power for the music festival itself. Imagine Shania Twain or Coldplay powered entirely by clean, off grid, energy! We encourage all events and festivals that require remote power to get in touch with Allye and make festivals truly sustainable.”\nOther BESS: Coldplay’s own unit and other smaller BESS Coldplay headlined Glastonbury on Saturday and the band has its own 1.5MWh BESS unit it uses while on tour. Unveiled a few years ago, the BESS uses 40 batteries including re-used EV batteries from BMW’s i3 range.\n“We’re proud to partner with BMW to create the world’s first tourable, rechargeable show battery – which will allow us to power our concerts almost entirely from clean, renewable energy”, said Coldplay’s lead singer Chris Martin back in 2021.\nOther smaller BESS were used on site but most were as backup to generators rather than the other way around, Patterson said.\nThe festival is among the largest in the world.

    "title": "“Financial Times” critica decisões de Toffoli sobre a Lava Jato",
    "text": "Um evento liderado pelo presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), focado no auxílio às vítimas de enchentes no Rio Grande do Sul, ganhou destaque pela presença dos irmãos Joesley e Wesley Batista, figuras centrais no escândalo da Lava Jato. O jornal britânico Financial Times sugeriu que essa presença pode indicar um possível desgaste do “legado” da operação.\nEm um texto publicado nesta 5ª feira (6.jun.2024), o Financial Times abordou o papel do ministro Dias Toffoli, do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), nas recentes controvérsias envolvendo a Lava Jato. A reportagem destacou ações de Toffoli que resultaram na reversão de condenações e na anulação de multas em casos notórios de corrupção.\nFormulário de cadastro receba alertas grátis do Poder360 quero receber por e-mail concordo com os termos da LGPD . quero receber no WhatsApp Inscreva-se quero receber no Telegram Inscreva-se “Para muitos, o retorno público dos irmãos Batista destaca como o legado da longa investigação da Lava Jato está sendo desmantelado desde o retorno de Lula à presidência para seu terceiro mandato não consecutivo” , afirma reportagem do jornal.\nDesde o início do 3º mandato de Lula, decisões como a anulação das condenações de Marcelo Odebrecht e José Dirceu têm sido vistas como um retrocesso. O Financial Times diz que o gabinete de Toffoli defendeu as decisões, afirmando que estavam “baseadas na Constituição e nas leis do país” e seguiam precedentes do tribunal de 2022. Toffoli, ministro desde 2009 e podendo ficar na Corte até 2042, criticou o que considera um conluio na Lava Jato que impediu o devido processo legal.\n“Grande parte do trabalho para desfazer os resultados da investigação — que recuperou bilhões de dólares de empresas envolvidas — está nas mãos do Supremo Tribunal Federal e, em particular, do Ministro José Antonio Dias Toffoli” , continuou o Financial Times .\nA publicação também destacou a percepção pública negativa em relação a Toffoli e ao STF, citando uma pesquisa da AtlasIntel que revelou desaprovação às suas decisões relacionadas à Lava Jato. A queda do Brasil no Índice de Percepção de Corrupção da Transparência Internacional, agora no 104º lugar entre 180 países, foi outro ponto levantado pelo jornal.\nPara Thomas Traumann, ex-ministro e articulista do Poder360 , o que Toffoli está fazendo é “basicamente tentar apagar todas as partes boas” da operação Lava Jato.\n“Durante os últimos 10 anos, não há dúvida de que tanto o estado brasileiro quanto as empresas privadas melhoraram sua conformidade. Mas o que Toffoli está dizendo é: ‘Você não precisa se preocupar [com ser processado por corrupção] porque em 10 anos o sistema de justiça simplesmente vai deixar passar” .\nChampions League O STF realizou um pagamento de R$ 39 mil em diárias internacionais para o segurança de Toffoli durante sua viagem ao Reino Unido, de 25 maio a 3 de junho. A viagem incluiu a ida do ministro na final da Champions League, realizada em 1º de junho, onde o Real Madrid conquistou seu 15º título.\nO STF não forneceu detalhes sobre a viagem, mas enfatizou que as atividades do ministro não foram interrompidas, assegurando que Toffoli manteve seu ritmo de trabalho e participou de uma sessão do STF remotamente em 29 de maio.\nOs detalhes financeiros da viagem foram obtidos por meio de uma ordem bancária emitida em 27 de maio, acessada nos dados do SiaFi (Sistema Integrado de Administração Financeira). A revelação de que Toffoli foi ao jogo foi inicialmente dada pelo jornal O Globo.\nÀ Folha de S.Paulo , o STF disse que “em nenhuma viagem o ministro recebeu passagens ou diárias” do tribunal. O STF também ressaltou a importância da segurança dos ministros, justificando que eles recebem proteção tanto em agendas institucionais quanto pessoais, devido aos riscos associados às suas funções.",
