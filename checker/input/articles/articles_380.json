    "title": "5 most dangerous fashion choices for women",
    "text": "Many women love to express their style through the clothes and accessories they choose to wear.\n5 most dangerous fashion choices for women\nFashion is all about looking good and feeling confident.\nRecommended articles\nWhether it's a pair of high heels for a night out, tight jeans that fit just right, or a stylish handbag that completes an outfit, fashion allows women to show their personality and creativity.\nHowever, some fashion choices, while trendy and appealing, can also be risky and harmful to health. These choices might cause discomfort, pain, or even long-term health problems. It’s important to understand that looking good doesn’t have to mean putting your health at risk. Here’s a look at some of the most dangerous fashion choices for women:\n1. High heels\nHigh heels are a classic fashion staple for many women, making them look taller and their legs longer. However, wearing high heels regularly can lead to a variety of health issues. The pressure that\nhigh heels put on the feet can cause pain in the toes and the balls of the feet. Long-term use can even lead to serious problems like bunions, hammertoes, and joint pain. High heels also affect your posture, putting extra strain on your back and knees, which can lead to chronic pain over time.\n2. Tight jeans\nTight jeans, referred to as \"skinny jeans,\" have been a popular fashion choice for years. They hug the body and create a sleek silhouette, which many women find attractive. However, wearing jeans that are too tight can restrict blood circulation in the legs and lead to numbness or a tingling sensation. This condition, known as \"skinny jean syndrome,\" can cause muscle and nerve damage if tight jeans are worn too frequently. Tight clothing around the waist can also put pressure on the stomach, leading to digestive problems. To avoid these issues, it's important to choose jeans that fit well but don’t feel overly tight or uncomfortable.\n3. Heavy handbags\nLarge, heavy handbags may look stylish and can carry all your essentials, but they can also cause serious strain on your shoulders, neck, and back. Carrying a heavy bag on one shoulder creates an imbalance, leading to poor posture and pain.\nOver time, this can result in long-term back and neck problems. To prevent these issues, try to keep your handbag as light as possible, regularly clean it out to remove unnecessary items, and consider using a backpack-style bag that distributes weight evenly.\n4. Corsets and waist trainers\nCorsets and waist trainers have made a comeback in recent years, thanks to the desire for an hourglass figure. These garments are designed to cinch the waist and create a slim appearance. However, wearing them too tightly or for extended periods can cause significant health problems. They restrict breathing, put pressure on internal organs, and can even lead to rib fractures in extreme cases.\nInstead of using corsets and waist trainers, consider a healthy diet and regular exercise for a natural and safe way to achieve your desired body shape.\n5. Flip-flops\nWhile flip-flops are convenient and comfortable for short-term wear, like at the beach or around the house, they offer little to no support for the feet. Prolonged use of flip-flops can lead to foot pain, particularly in the arches and heels, and increase the risk of injuries like ankle sprains. The lack of support also forces your feet to grip the shoe, which can cause muscle strain. For better foot health, opt for shoes that provide good arch support and cushioning, especially when walking long distances or standing for extended periods.\nThis content was created with the help of an AI model and verified by the writer.\nJOIN OUR PULSE COMMUNITY!\nEyewitness?

    "title": "James Carville demands more 'slanted coverage' of Trump, slams New York Times",
    "text": "Democratic strategist James Carville demanded more &quot;slanted&quot; media coverage of Donald Trump during his podcast on Thursday and called out the executive editor of The New York Times for saying the paper intended to &quot;cover the full range of issues&quot; in the presidential campaign, not just those favorable to one side. &quot;Now you have Joe Kahn, the new editor or publisher, whatever he is at The New York Times, saying, ‘We’re just got to cover this down the middle. We’re going to cover what it is.’ I don’t think that’s the role of the news media at a time when the entire Constitution is in peril,&quot; Carville said during his &quot;Politics War Room&quot; podcast, which was first reported by The Daily Caller. &quot;I don’t have anything against slanted coverage. I really don’t, I would have something against it at most other times in American history, but not right now. F--- your objectivity. The real objectivity in this country right now is we’re either going to have a Constitution or we’re not,&quot; Carville said. Kahn pushed back on the idea the media needed to &quot;abandon its central role as a source of impartial information&quot; because Trump is considered a threat to democracy during an interview with Semafor in May. He said it wasn&#039;t the job of the Times to become &quot;an instrument of the Biden campaign.&quot; Democratic strategist James Carville during a recent appearance on HBO&#039;s &quot;Real Time.&quot; Fox News BIDEN NEEDS TO ‘PRACTICE WHAT HE PREACHES’ AND RISE TO THE MOMENT AFTER LECTURING PRESS, CRITICS SAY &quot;Everything else, from Hunter Biden’s gun application to Judge Merchan’s, I don’t know, $35 contribution, to all of the bulls--t that the professional center feels like they got to put out. I can’t tell you that these are bad people. They’re extremely naive people who have no idea what’s at stake in this election,&quot; Carville said. &quot;So I think we need slanted coverage, more slanted coverage and I think we got to recognize the threat that this guy and the MAGA, not just him, the entire MAGA movement, from [Justice] Alito and Trump on down is a serious, it&#039;s a clear, serious and present danger to the existence of the Constitution in the United States. And I mean that,&quot; he continued. Carville, who has routinely sounded the alarm over the Democratic Party&#039;s chances in 2024 and Biden&#039;s re-election campaign, previously told Biden and his team to stop complaining about the New York Times&#039; coverage of him, arguing it was a &quot;waste of time.&quot; Al Hunt, Carville&#039;s podcast co-host and a former reporter at the Wall Street Journal, pushed back on Carville&#039;s use of the term &quot;slanted,&quot; arguing, &quot;we need fair coverage, and not false equivalency.&quot; Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to a crowd during a campaign rally on September 25, 2023 in Summerville, South Carolina. Getty Images BIDEN FACING UPHILL BATTLE IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AS DOWN-BALLOT DEMS LEAD: POLL During Kahn&#039;s interview with Semafor, he said democracy, an issue the Biden campaign has focused a lot on, was not a top issue for voters. &quot;It’s our job to cover the full range of issues that people have. At the moment, democracy is one of them. But it’s not the top one — immigration happens to be the top [of polls], and the economy and inflation is the second. Should we stop covering those things because they’re favorable to Trump and minimize them?&quot; he said. &quot;We become an instrument of the Biden campaign? We turn ourselves into Xinhua News Agency or Pravda and put out a stream of stuff that’s very, very favorable to them and only write negative stories about the other side? And that would accomplish — what?&quot; Kahn&#039;s comments triggered a debate about what role the media needed to play in the upcoming November election, as Democrats and some pundits continue to sound the alarm about democracy being at stake. &quot;The NYT has publicly stated over the years that it supports the bedrock principles of American democracy and is opposed to authoritarianism. And, over the last several months, its reporters have indicated that Donald Trump, if elected, would rule with a blatant disregard for democratic norms, akin to an authoritarian. Which means, if one does the math, that The NYT as an institution should by default oppose what Trump&#039;s candidacy embodies,&quot; CNN&#039;s Oliver Darcy wrote. &quot;But it is worth asking: If newsrooms are pro-democracy, and if their reporting indicates one candidate is opposed to democratic values, how can they feign ignorance on the 2024 race?&quot; he continued. Fox News&#039; David Rutz and Brian Flood contributed to this report. Original article source: James Carville demands more &#039;slanted coverage&#039; of Trump, slams New York Times",

    "title": "Great Springs Project partners with local governments to create greenway through Central Texas",
    "text": "The Texas Environmental Commission passed a motion on Sept. 18 recommending local governments partner with the Great Springs Project, a non-profit organization working to create a greenway of protected lands between Austin and San Antonio.\nThe Great Springs Project aims to build a hike and bike trail spanning over 100 miles and connecting the four great springs of Central Texas, from the Alamo to the Capital. The second part of its mission is to conserve an additional 50,000 acres of the “iconic Texas Hill Country” over the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, said Emma Lindrose-Siegel, the chief development officer for the project. Completion is expected by 2036.\n“Our vision at the Great Springs Project is to really serve as a connector and an amplifier of (city projects) and engage with those communities and with those local governments to learn more about their priorities and what they need to make those shared goals happen, whether that’s planning or funding or collaboration,” Lindrose-Siegel said. “To have the Environmental Commission approve that recommendation is such a wonderful step in our tenure as an organization to build consensus and increase collaboration.”\nLindrose-Siegel said the organization must work with local governments as the project’s support depends on the needs of each region and location, including promoting cyclist and pedestrian-friendly streets in San Antonio and building a new public park in Schertz, a town part of the San Antonio metropolitan area.\nIn Austin, the program focuses on three main missions, including constructing an additional trail in southeast Travis County in collaboration with the Travis County Parks Foundation advocating for the Hill Country Headwaters Conservation Initiative to permanently protect sensitive natural resources and secure funding for a new South Austin trail.\nJoanna Wolaver, executive director of the Travis County Parks Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the county park system, said with the help of the Great Springs Project, the foundation can build a 70-mile trail system along Dillon Creek, Onion Creek, Wilbarger Creek and the Colorado River in eastern Travis County. She said the foundation and project recently co-submitted an application to the Environmental Protection Agency with other nonprofit partners to fund projects along the Onion Creek Greenway.\n“I think that access to well-maintained natural areas and parks is just critical to the health of our communities,” Wolaver said. “The more we can bring those spaces to our different communities, the better off we all are.”\nDean Hendrickson, a curator of ichthyology at UT’s Biodiversity Center, said news of the project thrilled him because it draws attention to the Edwards Aquifer, helping him study two species of blind catfishes only found in the aquifer. He said the health of the species can indicate the health of the water Texans consume.\n“(The project) would call attention to the aquifer and the biodiversity,” Hendrickson said. “It’s amazing to me how few people know about all that amazing biodiversity just straight down below them. The more I talk to people in San Antonio, there are precious few that really are aware about what’s down there.”",
