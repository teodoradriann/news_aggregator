    "title": "Realizing the Seriousness of Writing a “Solemn Statement” and Continuing Cultivation | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) The Minghui website recently published news that some practitioners in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, had been arrested, harassed and detained for publishing “solemn statements.” My heart felt heavy when I read this. I wondered if the police had dared to do this because of loopholes in these practitioners’ cultivation. Master Li (the founder of Falun Dafa) said, “... everything that happens today in the ordinary society is the result of Dafa disciples’ thoughts.” (“ [Fa Teaching Given at the 2002 Conference in Philadelphia, U.S.A.](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20021130L.html),” Collected Teachings Given Around the World, Volume II) After the sharing “ [The Importance of Issuing a Solemn Statement](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2022/5/22/201439.html)” was published on Minghui website last year, I noticed the volume of solemn statements increased. This is a good thing, because it indicates that more former practitioners have returned to their cultivation path. The opportunity to write a solemn statement is another chance for practitioners who didn’t do well, and shows Master’s great benevolence. As stated in the sharing, “We must take the solemn statement seriously and not take Master’s mercy for granted. We should avoid making the same mistake of renouncing our faith under pressure again and again.” Some practitioners resumed cultivation and have done well. However, others have not done well. They made the same mistake over and over again and had to write solemn statements over and over again. Isn’t this a reflection of loopholes in cultivation that can be taken advantage of by the evil? Recently, many of us watched the film “Once We Were Divine.” The film showed the horrific scene that occurs when Dafa disciples’ righteous thoughts falter, which brings disaster to all sentient beings in our own heaven. However, when the King of Light refused to give in to the evil, his entire heavenly world returned to light. This reminded me of what Master taught us, “Once a vow is signed, it must be fulfilled!” (“ [Cultivation in Dafa Is Serious](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2023/9/2/211137.html)”) Cultivation in Dafa is serious. If one makes the same mistake over and over again, it discredits Master and Dafa. It is also a stain on one’s cultivation. In order to do the [three things] well and cultivate ourselves well, we must study the [Fa] well. In particular, practitioners who suffered persecution and later wrote a solemn statement, should not be in a hurry to get involved in Dafa activities. Instead they should study the Fa with a calm mind and search within for any gaps in their cultivation that led to their persecution. Only by truly improving in the Fa and cultivating oneself, can one do the three things well. We once vowed to come down to this world together to assist Master in Fa-rectification, so we can return to Heaven together. Dafa disciples―we must fulfill our vows! Note: This article only represents the author’s current understanding meant for sharing among practitioners so that we can “Compare with one another in study, in cultivation.” (“Solid Cultivation,” [Hong Yin](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/hongyin/v3/hy.htm#20)) Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org.

    "title": "Why has my Netflix changed language?",
    "text": "Why has my Netflix changed language?\nNetflix is a popular streaming service that has gained a massive following worldwide. Its extensive library of content is easily accessible in multiple languages, which can be a major draw for many subscribers. However, some users have reported finding their Netflix account changed language unexpectedly, making it difficult to navigate and enjoy the platform as usual. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind this phenomenon, along with some troubleshooting steps and language change methods.\nWhy has your Netflix account changed language?\nThere are several possible reasons why your Netflix account may have changed language without your consent. Here are a few explanations:\nLanguage set in your device’s settings: By default, many devices, including smartphones and computers, automatically detect the language based on their location or the device settings. If your device is set to a specific language, it may override the language selection in Netflix.\nRegion switch: Netflix is available in several countries with different language options. If you changed your region or location, Netflix might switch to the language associated with your new location.\nProfile or username: Each Netflix profile has a specific language setting. If you have created a new profile or changed your username, it might have reset the language.\nDevice compatibility issues: Different devices, such as smart TVs or Blu-ray players, may have specific issues with language settings or configurations. These issues can cause language settings to be overridden or changed unexpectedly.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nHow to troubleshoot Netflix language change issues Language change methods for Netflix Closing thoughts How to troubleshoot Netflix language change issues\nWhen faced with a Netflix language change issue, try these troubleshooting steps:\nRestart your device: Sometimes, simple devices may need a reboot to revert back to the original language settings. Log out of Netflix, restart your device, and then log back in.\nChange language settings: Go to the account profile dropdown menu and select Setting > Language . Switch back to your preferred language or one you are familiar with.\nVerify device settings: Check the language settings on your device (Settings > Language) and see if it matches the language you want in Netflix. Adjust the device language as necessary.\nCheck your account setting: Verify that your account setting and login credentials are correct, especially if you have multiple profiles or have tried using a different login.\nStep 1:\nChange Language Settings\nStep 2:\nVerify Device Language Setting\nStep 3:\nCheck Account Setting and Login\nLanguage change methods for Netflix\nIf you still encounter language-related issues after troubleshooting, you can try using one of the following methods:\nAutomatic Language Detection: Netflix uses intelligent language detection to adjust the language based on the audio or subtitles of the content being viewed. Try enabling Automatic Language Detection : Go to Setting > Sound and toggle on Subtitles and Audio Language : to enable automatic language detection for movies and TV shows.\nAdd Language Option: If the auto-detection feature doesn’t work as desired, add a language option for subtitles and audio : Go to Setting > Sound and toggle off Automatic Language Detection . This allows you to manually select the language or caption settings for individual content.\nIf the language change issue is not resolved using the above troubleshooting methods or language change options, you can attempt the following:\nContact Netflix Customer Support: Reach out to the Netflix Help Center ( https://help.netflix.com/en-contactus ) or contact a live representative through phone. Explain the issue and provide your profile name, device information, and date of the language change.\nSystem check: If the issue is persisted, it might be related to your TV’s settings or software. Check the Netgear support page or device documentation for specific troubleshooting guides relevant to your device.\nClosing thoughts\nFor some users, Netflix may inexplicably change language settings due to various reasons, including device compatibility or changes to account settings. By understanding possible reasons for language changes and attempting some basic troubleshooting steps, you should be able to revert back to your preferred language option.\nIf the issue persists, utilize language change methods, and ensure the device settings and automatic language detection are configured correctly. It’s also essential to contact Netflix Support or check the device manufacturer support for assistance.",

    "text": "Hastings: Let the light shine “Your light must shine before others so that they may see your good acts and give praise to your Abba God in heaven.” — Matthew 5:16 The Inclusive Bible After celebrating light in the darkest season of the year, many places still need a shining light. One of those places is our country’s mass incarceration system. Our country has 5% of the earth’s people but 20% of earth’s prisoners. There has been a 500% increase in incarceration, mostly Black and Brown, and an 800% increase in women’s incarceration, even though crime rates are down. This has occurred since the 1970s when state hospitals were closed. For most health crises people are taken to a health care facility. For brain health crises, people are taken to prisons which are not equipped for brain health care — or for rehabilitation and restoration of people to the communities where they will someday be our co-workers and neighbors. Norway is one country shining a light in this realm of darkness, reducing recidivism rates. The Norwegian model focuses on rehabilitation and job training and second chances. This approach creates a less-hostile, more community-based environment for people serving time as well as staff. The mutual goal is to better help incarcerated people reintegrate into society. Several states are already looking to the Norwegian model, re-purposing a factory into a center for innovation, providing social services and breaking cycles of crime. Many charities are operating housing facilities for those released from prison to help rebuild lives. The light of justice has a ripple effect as community by community, a grassroots movement grows until it becomes the norm. Of those who are building new systems of justice, Jesus says, “Those who are just will shine like the sun ... in the kindom of their Abba God.”* So let the light shine! *Matthew 13:43 The Inclusive Bible The Rev. Celia M. Hastings has a master’s degree in religious education from Western Theological Seminary in Holland. She is author of “The Wisdom Series” and “The Undertaker’s Wife.”",

    "text": "\"Hay una cosa que no me gusta. Nos están tomando manía los chicos. Este feminismo de ahora atacando a los hombres no me parece buena política\". Estas son las palabras con las que la actriz Carmen Maura ha cargado contra el movimiento feminista en el programa de RTVE No sé de qué me hablas. Relacionada: Las polémicas declaraciones de Carmen Maura sobre el feminismo que han incendiado las redes: \"Ya es hora de que las mujeres empecemos a relajarnos\" Pero esto no es todo. La actriz contestaba a las preguntas de la periodista Mercedes Milá cuando también ha deslizado el bulo machista de las denuncias falsas en casos de violencia de género: \"Yo conozco casos muy cercanos de hombres que han sido acusados de violencia y que no era cierta\", apuntaba Maura. Sin embargo, el porcentaje de denuncias falsas sobre el total en estos casos es de 0,01%, según el último informe de la Fiscalía. Discursos que no tienen ni medio centímetro de profundidad intelectual más allá de repetir el “yo no soy de esas” para intentar no sentir el rechazo masculino. Casualmente estos discursos de “antipatía feminista” vienen de mujeres blancas y burguesas. pic.twitter.com\\/8MwtuspB8r — Olympe Abogados (@olympeabogados) December 23, 2023 Entre ambas intervenciones, Milá dio paso a su compañera y también conductora del espacio, Inés Hernand, que rebatió las palabras de Maura: \"Las políticas feministas no pretenden que esto sea una guerra de sexos ni muchísimo menos. A un hombre feminista le empoderan también. ¿Quién no va a querer igualdad de condiciones?\", espetaba la comunicadora. La respuesta de Willy Toledo Hernand, sin embargo, no ha sido la única que tenía algo que decir sobre el alegato contra \"este feminismo de ahora\" de la actriz. El también actor Willy Toledo ha criticado las palabras de Maura a través de la red social X: \"Que dice la Maura que feminismo pero sin molestar a los hombres y que muchísimas denuncias falsas\". Que dice la Maura que feminismo pero sin molestar a los hombres y que muchísimas denuncias falsas. https:\\/\\/t.co\\/kUeFTY7VKp — Guillermo Toledo (@guillermoTM1959) December 23, 2023 Esta no es la primera vez que Carmen Maura critica a el movimiento feminista y que pone en duda a las víctimas. De hecho, en 2019 ya cargó contra sus compañeras de profesión que denunciaron agresiones sexuales: \"De todas las del cine que dicen que las han violado, me creo a la mitad\" , dijo en una entrevista.",
