    "text": "Everything Bagel Cheese Ball is an easy appetizer that’s always a huge hit at parties! It’s great for making ahead of time with a few simple ingredients. The cheese ball itself is made with cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar and parmesan, and it’s all coated in crunchy homemade everything bagel seasoning!\nEntertaining is so much fun with recipes like\nRanch Cheddar Cheese Ball and Mini Cheese Balls Trio.\nTable of Contents\nHave you tried everything bagel seasoning yet? Oh, you must try it as soon as possible. I’m not just talking about everything bagels, I’m talking about the seasoning itself. You can use it on sandwiches, rolls, pinwheels, chicken, hummus, dips, and so many other foods. This simple combination of garlic, onion, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and salt is not just for bagels anymore.\nCheese ball is that classic appetizer that I make for almost every holiday. It’s so easy and always popular at parties. I’ve tried many different flavors and incorporated different seasonal ingredients, but this one is now our favorite. Cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning make a perfect pair, after all.\nYou can serve this cheese ball with so many options. Try it with pretzels, crackers, bagel chips, chips, celery, cucumbers, carrot sticks, and many other vegetables. If you have any cheese ball leftover, spread it on your toast or bagel in the morning. It makes an amazing spread for sandwiches as well!\nWhat is everything bagel seasoning?\nEverything bagel seasoning is pretty widely available in many grocery stores, but it’s so also easy to make at home whenever you need it. It’s a simple combination of dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, flaked salt, black sesame seeds, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. Plus, it is a little cheaper to make your own seasoning.\nTo make everything bagel seasoning, simply combine all the ingredients together in a glass jar with a lid, close the lid tight, and shake it to mix. You can make it just for the recipe and make extra and store it in the same glass jar. Seasoning mixes tend to have a long shelf life, just make sure to store it in a cool, dark place.\nIngredient Notes\nEverything Bagel Seasoning – This is a simple combination of dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, poppy seeds and flaky salt. You can also buy it at the store already mixed and ready to use if you’d prefer.\nParmesan Cheese – For the best flavor and consistency, use freshly grated parmesan cheese.\nSour Cream – I don’t recommend using low-fat sour cream. It won’t have the same thick consistency as regular sour cream.\nCream Cheese – This should also NOT be low-fat! Plus, make sure you buy plain cream cheese with no added flavors.\nWhite Cheddar Cheese – I like using white cheddar because the color matches the other ingredients in the cheese ball. However, you can use yellow cheddar if that’s what you already have on hand. The only difference between yellow and white cheddar is the color. There is no difference in flavor.\nSee recipe card for complete information on ingredients and quantities.\nHow to Make Everything Bagel Cheese Ball\nMake the seasoning. Combine all of the ingredients in a jar, close with a lid and shake. Alternately, you can can mix everything together in a bowl with a spoon. (1)\nLet the cream cheese soften. Pull the cream cheese out of the refrigerator to soften 30-45 minutes before making the cheese ball.\nAdd more cheeses. Combine cream cheese with sour cream and grated cheeses (2).\nAdd seasoning. Mix the everything bagel seasoning into the cheese mixture (3).\nTransfer to a bowl. Place a large piece of plastic wrap inside a deep bowl and transfer the cream cheese mixture into the bowl (4).\nForm a cheese ball. Bring all the ends of plastic wrap together and twist to seal. Shape the mixture into a ball and place it back into a bowl (5).\nChill. Refrigerate the cheese ball overnight, or for at least 2 hours.\nRoll it in seasoning. About 20 minutes before serving, unwrap the cheese ball and roll it in everything bagel seasoning.\nPRO TIP: Let the cheese ball sit for 15-20 minutes before serving it to the guests. This will give it a chance to soften and be easier to spread.\nHow to Make Mini Cheese Balls\nPrepare the cream cheese mixture according to the recipe, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. No need to shape the mixture into a ball since it will be divided into small portions.\nTo keep mini cheese balls the same size, use a cookie scoop to scoop out even amounts of cheese mixture and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in seasoning mix.\nInsert pretzel sticks into each mini cheese ball. Note that you may need a little more seasoning mix for mini cheese balls.\nMake Ahead, Storing, Freezing\nMake Ahead: One of the reasons I love this appetizer is that I can make it ahead of time. Just don’t roll it in seasoning until right before serving, that way the seasoning doesn’t get soggy. You can also wrap the cheese ball in an extra layer of aluminum foil, after it’s been wrapped in plastic wrap. This will give it a little more protection from exposure to air.\nStoring: Properly stored and refrigerated, a cheese ball can last up to 7 days. Make sure to wrap it airtight in plastic or other wrap.\nFreezing: Technically, you can freeze a cheese ball before coating it in seasoning or nuts. In practice though, I have noticed a textural difference after the cheese ball has been defrosted. Since cream cheese and sour cream both contain a good amount of liquid, it doesn’t retain the same smooth texture after being defrosted.\nRecipe FAQs\nAll different kinds of different dippers work well! Crackers, pretzel chips, crisp veggies (like sliced bell peppers), pita and crostini are all great options. You can also plate this cheese ball with various meats as part of a charcuterie board.\nAbsolutely! You can shape it into a football for game day, a Christmas tree for a holiday party, an egg for Easter, and whatever other themed shapes you can think of. The best way to shape it is on the wrap, then wrap it in that shape and refrigerate for a couple of hours to set.\nYes, you technically can use a lactose free cream cheese but it won’t be as dense. It will still hold its shape, just make sure to strain off any liquid in the cream cheese container before adding it to the cheese ball mixture. If the cheese ball seems a little too thin, you can always add a little more grated cheddar and/or parmesan cheese.\nMore Party Appetizer Recipes To Try\nDID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE?

    "text": "A greve no setor vidreiro vai continuar na próxima semana nas empresas do Grupo BA Glass, disse esta quinta-feira à agência Lusa a coordenadora da Federação Portuguesa dos Sindicatos da Construção, Cerâmica e Vidro (FEVICCOM).\n“Vamos continuar no setor do vidro de embalagem com novas greves na próxima semana. Serão em três fábricas da maior empresa do setor do vidro de embalagem no nosso país, que é a BA Glass”, afirmou Fátima Messias. A BA Glass tem unidades na Marinha Grande, distrito de Leiria, Avintes (Porto) e Venda Nova (Lisboa) e, segundo a FEVICCOM, têm mais de mil trabalhadores.\nA paralisação decorre de terça-feira, 1 de abril, a 3 de abril, esclareceu a coordenadora, referindo que, neste grupo, tem havido “ainda mais dificuldades porque recusa negociar, pura e simplesmente”.\nEsta greve no setor vidreiro começou na terça-feira, na Marinha Grande, em três empresas do Grupo Vidrala (Santos Barosa, Gallo Vidro e Vidrala Logistics), para “reclamar aumentos salariais dignos e a melhoria das condições de trabalho” e, segundo Fátima Messias, tem registado uma “elevada adesão dos trabalhadores”.\n“Começou na Santos Barosa, que terminou hoje de madrugada, com uma adesão praticamente total desde o início da greve. Continuou na Gallo Vidro, também com uma adesão a 100% com paragem de produção, e, hoje de madrugada, iniciou na terceira das empresas, a Vidrala Logistics, também com uma grande adesão”, declarou.\nA sindicalista salientou que “as razões dos trabalhadores ficaram bem evidenciadas nesta luta que já não se fazia há vários anos e nunca se fez assim em simultâneo nestas empresas”.\n“ Os trabalhadores reclamam, efetivamente, um aumento salarial maior, digno, que reflita o aumento do custo de vida que temos vivido e também melhores condições de trabalho, porque trabalhar por turnos e, em especial, em elaboração contínua faz com que uma boa parte da nossa vida fique no interior das fábricas, de noite, de dia, fins de semana, sábados, domingos, feriados”, realçou.\nObservando que é “muito duro trabalhar assim”, a coordenadora sustentou que, “por isso, os trabalhadores exigem e reclamam uma devida valorização do seu trabalho e respeito pelo esforço que fazem”.\nFátima Messias acusou ainda duas empresas do Grupo Vidrala “de tentar aliciar os trabalhadores a não aderirem à greve ainda antes de ela começar”, enviando declarações “para os pressionar a executarem tarefas que cabem ao piquete de greve decidir, que têm a ver com a segurança dos equipamentos e das instalações”.\nExplicando que o número e funcionários que receberam as declarações ainda está por apurar, Fátima Messias referiu que se trata de “uma pressão ilegítima, violadora da Lei da greve e do direito de greve”. Por outro lado, a FEVICCOM adiantou que numa das fábricas houve “procedimentos técnicos por parte de responsáveis” que “poderiam ter conduzido a prejuízos sérios”.\n“Foram procedimentos técnicos com os quais os trabalhadores que estavam em greve a garantir a segurança dos equipamentos e das instalações não concordaram”, disse, avançando que houve necessidade de intervenção dos bombeiros por se terem atingido “temperaturas demasiado elevadas da água”.\nRelativamente à primeira situação, houve uma “visita inspetiva da Autoridade para as Condições de Trabalho” e, quanto à segunda, Federação e Sindicato dos Trabalhadores da Indústria Vidreira vão avaliar a ação a desenvolver. A coordenadora da FEVICCOM afirmou que se exige agora que “as empresas voltem à mesa da negociação e tirem as devidas ilações desta demonstração de protesto”.\n“São os salários, são as condições de trabalho. As empresas devem voltar à mesa da negociação e vamos propor datas para essa reunião acontecer. Conforme depois o posicionamento das empresas, assim se decidirão novas formas de luta”, acrescentou Fátima Messias.",

    "title": "The Ongoing Fight Against the Jewishness of Jesus",
    "text": "You would think this would be pretty easy to get right: according to the Gospels, Yeshua (Jesus) was born a Jew in an ancient Jewish city in the historic land of Israel. But no, all this must be disputed, after all, how can Jesus be the liberator of the oppressed if He Himself was born to an oppressor people in an oppressor city? The narrative must be changed.\nThat’s why, for many years, we have heard that “Jesus was a Palestinian,” or, more fully, “Jesus was a Palestinian freedom fighter,” suggesting that He led an armed revolt against – guess who? – the Israeli Jews!\nIn the words of Hamid Dabashi, in an op-ed\npublished on December 25, 2018 on Aljazeera News, “Remember: Christ was a Palestinian refugee.”\nDabashi, the Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, does acknowledge that Jesus was Jewish, but only in the context of being “a Jewish Palestinian refugee child who grew up to become a towering revolutionary figure.”\nAnd in the midst of an article meant to be conciliatory for Muslims and Christians, he opines, “The dark days of Zionism laying a false claim on\nJudaism and Palestine alike are happily over. The lies of a gang of European settler colonialists trying to rob Jews of their ancestral faith and Palestinians of their historical homeland have finally come to a crushing defeat when Jews and Palestinians, and Jews as Palestinians, have come together to lay a post-Zionist claim on their ancestral faith and homeland alike.”\nCan you feel the Christmas spirit? (And yes, when you parse every word of that paragraph, Prof. Dabashi’s claims are beyond shocking.)\nThis very Christmas, a Catholic priest from New York, Father Edward Beck,\nsaid this on CNN: “What I’m so struck by is that the story of Christmas is about a Palestinian Jew. How often do you find those words put together? A Palestinian Jew born into a time when his country was occupied, right? They can’t find a place for [Jesus’s mother, Mary] to even give birth. They’re homeless. They eventually have to flee as refugees into Egypt, no less. I mean, you can’t make up the parallels to our current world situation right now.”\nThis is not just a matter of historical inaccuracy, since the land in which Yeshua was born was not called Palestine until more than one century after His death and resurrection.\nThis is a matter of separating Yeshua the Jew from the Jewish people as a whole and from His ancient Jewish homeland. It is also making a political statement, comparing the first-century Roman occupiers of Judea with the people of Israel today, occupiers of the West Bank and Gaza. The Romans were and the Israelis are evil oppressors with no right to the land.\nThat’s the magic of using words like “Palestinian” and “occupied.”\nAs for language that is even more extreme, how about these\ncomments from Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh on December 28, 2020?\n“The birthday of our lord Jesus, peace be upon him – the first Palestinian self-sacrificing fighter from whom we learned Martyrdom-death, and who paid for his mission with his life – takes place at the same time as the anniversary of the outbreak of the Palestinian revolution [i.e., the anniversary of “the Launch” of Fatah, counted from its first terror attack against Israel], for which thousands of Martyrs have paid with their lives so that we will live and remain, and so that our children will dream of a better future.” (For a sampling of other, similar quotes, see\nhere.)\nDid you think I was exaggerating?\nHow threatening it is to say that Yeshua was a Judean Jew, born in Bethlehem, the ancient city of David, called “rabbi” (not “reverend” or “imam”) by His followers.\nThis does not mean that Jesus would agree with every policy of Israel today or of every tenet of Judaism. He certainly would not. (The same can be said about Him agreeing with every American policy today or of every tenet of Christianity.) And this does not imply that He does not hurt for the downtrodden and the oppressed of all peoples. He certainly does.\nBut the references to Him as a Palestinian refugee born in occupied territory, not to mention Him being compared to an Islamic jihadist “martyr,” are meant to mislead in the most insidious way.\nIn comparison, the recent article by Victoria Emily Jones in Christianity Today, while not insidious, is certainly misleading,\nstating, “Jesus was born in Asia. He was Asian. Yet the preponderance of Christian art that shows him at home in Europe has meant that he is embedded deeply in the popular imagination as Western.”\nWhat, exactly, does Jones mean? Pointing to Asian nativity scenes dating back 1240, she explains, “Some may object to depicting Jesus as anything other than a brown male born into a Jewish family in Bethlehem of Judea in the first century, believing that doing so undermines his historicity. But Christian artists who tackle the subject of the Incarnation are often aiming not at historical realism but at theological meaning.\n“By representing Jesus as Japanese, Indonesian, or Indian, they convey a sense of God’s immanence, his ‘with-us–ness,’ for their own communities—and for everyone else, the universality of Christ’s birth.”\nOn the one hand, all this is quite understandable, since people from every nation embrace Jesus as “one of us.” That means that we depict Him (or imagine Him) to look like us. That’s why there are White European Jesus images and Black African Jesus images, along with other racial and ethnic Jesus images.\nBut Jesus was not born in Asia, nor was He Asian (based on what “Asian” would mean in the first-century Roman empire, and based on what “Asian” means today).\nMore importantly, given the historic attack on the Jewishness of Jesus, beginning with early Church leaders\nsevering the Jewish roots of the faith, continuing with classic Christian art that demonized the ancient Jewish leaders and transformed Jesus into a White European, moving to the Nazi effort to make Jesus into a non-Jewish Aryan, and to the current “Jesus was a Palestinian refugee” rhetoric, now would be a good time to emphasize historic truth.\nJesus, whose Hebrew name was Yeshua, was born in Bethlehem of Judea. His mother’s name was Miriam, and His followers were named Yaakov and Shimon and Yehudah, among others. And He was the Messiah (Christ in Greek) because He was hailed as the long-awaited Savior of the Jewish people (and thereby, the Savior of the whole world).\nHe was born King of the Jews and died King of the Jews.\nAnd when He comes again, He is returning to Jerusalem.\nDoes this offend you?",

    "title": "‘Little Death' Review: David Schwimmer Is a Misogynist TV Writer Outshined by Dominic Fike and Talia Ryder",
    "text": "‘Little Death’ Review: David Schwimmer Is a Misogynist TV Writer Outshined by Dominic Fike and Talia Ryder\nThere’s a perplexing choice at the heart of “Little Death,” directed by Jack Begert, best known for his work in music videos. That choice is essentially to make two very different movies and smash them together. If you squint closely, you can see the thematic throughlines between them, both stories about addiction told through different prisms, but while one is grating, the other is deftly told. You just have to make it through the first to get to the one that is more elegantly executed.\nBegert is primarily a music video director with credits like Olivia Rodrigo’s recent “get him back!” and Jack Harlow’s Fergie-sampling “First Class” under his belt. The hyperactive visual style of that genre is on full display in the first half of “Little Death,” which is narrated by a depressed, misogynistic television writer named Martin played by David Schwimmer and, eventually, Gaby Hoffmann, but I’ll get to that in a second.\nMartin hates the fact that he works on a corny NBC sitcom – a little in-joke with Schwimmer’s “Friends” past – and is working on a screenplay he hopes to direct about his childhood. He outwardly loathes his fiancée (Jena Malone) and has vivid fantasies about a mysterious woman (Angela Sarafyan) that turn into monologues illustrated with stock footage and animation.\nWhen some executives suggest that Martin give his script a female protagonist and he starts to internally rail against wokeness, that’s when Hoffmann steps into the role. It’s a Charlie Kaufman-esque turn that feels not quite thought-through. Hoffmann is supposed to represent what it would look like if suddenly you were to flip the gender of a character without making any other edits to his persona. And, yes, even as a woman, Martin would still be insipid. Hoffmann is game to lean into the Schwimmer mannerisms, but it’s a fun trick that doesn’t end up saying all that much.\nThe satire in this part of “Little Death” is flimsy. It both seemingly wants to excoriate Martin and give him a mouthpiece, as if to say, “Why can’t this guy tell his own story? Isn’t all this Hollywood diversity talk silly?” (Seth Green shows up as one of Martin’s writer friends to rail against the establishment.) Schwimmer, with his hangdog face, is a great avatar for this kind of man who thinks he deserves more, but spending time in Martin’s company starts to become infuriating.\nAnd yet! Before you get too comfortable or enraged with Martin, the plot shifts away from him. To explain exactly how this happens would be too much of a spoiler, but suddenly we’re in the company of AJ (Dominic Fike) and Karla (Talia Ryder), twenty-somethings who have their car and belongings stolen during a drug run that also put them in possession of a cute little Chihuahua. Begert gets rid of the chaotic tone and excessive cutaways to focus on their adventure throughout Los Angeles, which ultimately morphs into a story about drug use that is tender rather than overwrought.\nAJ and Karla are both addicts, but Fike and Ryder never play them leaning into the typical tropes we often see. Yes, they do drugs, but their dependency runs under the surface of their personas. Ryder especially probes into Karla’s vulnerabilities, so when we realize the extent of her reliance on substances, it’s heartbreaking rather than obvious. Meanwhile, Fike, a musician best known for his turn on “Euphoria,” has been vocal about his own drug use and similarly gives an understated performance, capped by a surprisingly moving final shot.\nThis isn’t to say that the second half of the film lacks any zaniness. AJ, who wants to open a taco truck, and Karla go to a party with a pig race, for instance, and there’s a stop at a dealer’s house that is yet another all too familiar spin on the Alfred Molina detour in “Boogie Nights.” Here, it features Karl Glusman projecting incel energy as he tries to protect a snowglobe from AJ and Karla’s zonked-out friend (Sante Bentivoglio).\nIt’s evident why “Little Death” has earned the support of Darren Aronofsky, who produces with his Protozoa shingle. In many ways, it feels like an heir to Aronofsky’s “Requiem for a Dream,” in the way it zigzags between its pill-poppers. Only it doesn’t have Aronofsky’s trademark intensity.\nYou can see Begert’s intent in the disjointed arc of the film. Martin is a kind of quote-unquote respectable addict who is far more callous than AJ and Karla, and yet the whiplash of the structure is just too forceful. In splitting up the film like this every character feels shortchanged, and the relationships aren’t given any time to flourish.\nBegert’s work is best when it’s at its most subtle, taking us on a trip through Los Angeles with two friends who rely on each other the same way they rely on drugs. As the camera offers a portrait of the city’s side streets and party houses and deli – shout out to Canter’s – it turns out AJ and Karla’s journey is ultimately one toward a potential recovery. Martin? Well, I’m not really sure why we even hung out with him at all.\nGrade: C “Little Death” premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.\nMore from IndieWire\nFor more stories like this, follow us on MSN by clicking the button at the top of this page.",

    "text": "Environmental advocates say plans to log parts of Zoar Valley are still in place as Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nominee for commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation prepares to lead the agency if confirmed.\nThe area is known as one of the most scenic and ecologically diverse environmental areas in Western New York.\nHowever, those hoping to stop the project see this change in leadership as a chance to turn a new leaf in the hopes of stopping the project.\n“It is a clean slate, letting her know about the public’s concerns and that we’re still absolutely focused on requesting that a public hearing be done,” said Lynn Kenney, president of the Zoar Valley Coalition.\nLast fall, members of the Zoar Valley Coalition spoke up against plans by the DEC and New York Connecticut Audubon to log 91 acres of second-growth trees.\nThe DEC and Audubon said at the time that this was an opportunity for environmental education and to improve habitat for certain bird species.\nThe Audubon has now pulled out of the project, but the DEC will continue to move forward with it.\nZoar Valley Coalition leaders said other organizations have joined their cause, including the Buffalo Ornithological Society, WNY Environmental Alliance and the Niagara Frontier Botanical Society.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the DEC said:\n\"DEC is developing options for a revised forest management plan in a select portion of the Zoar Valley Multiple Use Area (MUA), and will work directly with the community as part of our commitment to involving the public in advancing any management plans for this area.\nAs with the earlier proposal, any revised plans for management in the area will continue to protect the adjacent Zoar Unique Area’s old-growth trees and other features while creating habitat to enhance the resilience and adaptability of the Zoar MUA’s ecosystem. Also consistent with the original proposal, any revised project will not include any “clear-cutting” and will be contained wholly within the Zoar Valley MUA and not include any portion of the Zoar Valley Unique Area or the old-growth trees within its boundaries.\nZoar Valley MUA is nearly 3,000 acres, of which only a small portion will include the demonstration area. The MUA will continue to be publicly accessible before, during, and after any project developed, although there may be temporary restrictions in and around a project area during any active management to ensure public safety.\nAs any management plans are developed, DEC will engage directly with the community and our forestry experts to discuss the benefits and importance of habitat management activities, and ensure that any plans developed are reflective of the interests of the community.\nDEC continues to work collaboratively with Audubon New York-Connecticut to educate communities across New York on the environmental and ecological benefits of sustainable forest management.\"\nOther organizations have spoken out against plans to log.\nThe Western New York Environmental Alliance released a statement, saying in part:\n\"Destroying this living healthy habitat for this NYS DEC Audubon logging plan is a dangerous and thoughtless destruction of a long existing, established, and critical natural place. Zoar Valley and this site provides what must be characterized as substantial, if not unique, ecological value and services to the region. It is also a place providing past and future generations access to recreational activities, passive enjoyment, and the many benefits of natural places. Its contribution to human well-being is priceless.\"\nA joint statement released by the Nature Sanctuary Society of WNY and the Niagara Frontier Botanical Society can be found below:",
