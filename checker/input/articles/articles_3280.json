    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "text": "North American Reindeer Are Particularly Vulnerable to Rising Temperatures\nReindeer are an Ice Age species that have survived many episodes of Arctic warming.\nComplete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.\nReindeer, also known as caribou in North America, are an Ice Age species that have survived many episodes of Arctic warming. They are uniquely adapted to Arctic environments, where they regulate ecosystems and sustain the livelihoods of many Indigenous Peoples.\nDespite being one of the most abundant herbivores in the Arctic, climate change has contributed to a loss of nearly two-thirds of their global abundance over the last three decades.\nAn international team of researchers, led by the University of Adelaide and University of Copenhagen, looked back 21,000 years and examined how reindeer responded to past climatic events, asking whether they will be able to cope in the future.\n“Using fossils, ancient DNA and computer models, we reconstructed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer over the past 21,000 years at resolutions never done before, and we directly compared these to future predictions,” says lead investigator Dr. Elisabetta Canteri, from the University of Adelaide and University of Copenhagen.\n“This revealed that populations of reindeer have experienced major declines during periods of rapid climate warming, but the losses expected in the coming decades due to future climate change are likely to be even more severe than those in the past.”\nThe research team identified populations in North America as being particularly vulnerable.\n“Our forecasts show that these North American caribou populations are most at risk from climate warming, with declines of up to 80 percent likely by 2100 unless there are major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and increased investment in wildlife management and conservation,” says Associate Professor Damien Fordham, Deputy Director of the Environment Institute at the University of Adelaide, who co-led the research.\n“These declines are likely to have far-reaching ecological implications that will further increase the vulnerability of caribou in North America and reindeer in Eurasia to climatic warming and other stressors.”\nReindeer and caribou help maintain plant diversity in the tundra by feeding on some plants and influencing how others grow, meaning that where they disappear, plant diversity is likely to decline.\n“A reduction in tundra plant diversity resulting from the loss of reindeer and caribou will have many cascading effects, including reduction of carbon storage in Arctic soils,” says Professor Eric Post, from University of California Davis, who contributed to this research.\n“Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which of course would further threaten reindeer and caribou as well as ourselves.”\n“For thousands of years, the wellbeing of our own species has benefitted directly from healthy reindeer and caribou populations. Now more than ever we need to ensure their wellbeing in turn.”\nAssociate Professor Fordham says the results of this research, published in Science Advances, show urgent action is required.\n“Increasing investment in the management and conservation of reindeer and caribou populations, particularly in North America, where losses are forecast to be greatest, will benefit the persistence of this species and the services it provides to Arctic ecosystems and the communities that depend on them,” he says.\nReference: Canteri E, Brown SC, Post E, et al.

    "text": "Idaho house where 4 students were killed was razed. Here's what happened to other homes linked to notorious killings By Dakin Andone, CNN (CNN) — The University of Idaho on Thursday demolished the off-campus home where four students were fatally stabbed last year — the latest instance in which a property is razed following grisly, high-profile killings. Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were killed inside the Moscow, Idaho, off-campus rental on November 13, 2022, [stunning the university](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/us/idaho-student-killings-timeline/index.html) and the surrounding community. The owner of the home donated it to the university and the school planned to tear it down in July, before the start of the new academic year. But [those plans were delayed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/us/university-of-idaho-murder-home-demolition-wednesday/index.html) until this month, when the university announced attorneys for the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, had been [given access to the home](https://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2023/121423-kingrd-demo#:~:text=The%20house%20was%20given%20to,the%20house%2C%20to%20demolish%20it.) as part of their preparations for trial. Prosecutors also [accessed the house](https://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2023/122023-kingrd-prosecution) on December 21, the school said. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder, and [not guilty pleas](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-student-killings-standing-silent/index.html) have been entered on his behalf. Prosecutors have proposed his trial begin in the summer of 2024. Thursday’s demolition – taking place during winter break – was expected to last several days, the University of Idaho said in a news release this month. But it could be finished within a day, university spokesperson Jodi Walker told CNN. “It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” University of Idaho President Scott Green said in a news release. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.” On the eve of the demolition, the families of Goncalves and Kernodle pleaded with the university and local prosecutors to preserve the home. They argued it may provide evidence during the murder trial, including about how much the surviving roommates may have heard during the killings, according to a joint statement. But neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have opposed the demolition, [the university said](https://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2023/071223-kingroadhouse), and a prosecutor told school officials in an email the house is “so substantially different than at the time of the homicides” that a jury wouldn’t be authorized to see it. “While we certainly understand that there are a lot of emotions around that house – for the families especially – we also listened to our community and talked with prosecutors and the defense, and believe that now is a really good time to go ahead and take that house down,” Walker, the university spokesperson, told CNN Wednesday. Though it’s off university grounds, the house can be seen from the campus and is in an area populated with students, Walker noted, describing it as a “daily reminder of the horrific event that happened there.” The university won’t forget, she said, but “we can heal, and we can take that next step forward, and taking that house down is that next step.” With the house gone, attention can turn to the property’s future. The university intends to create a [memorial garden](https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/healing-garden-and-memorial) on the site to honor the four students, it has said, and landscape design and architecture students were set to draft concepts for the garden this past fall. The question of what to do with such properties has become distressingly rote in recent years, particularly in the US, where communities regularly have to grapple with the scenes of mass shootings, asking themselves how they honor the victims and their families while allowing those left behind to heal and move forward. That’s particularly difficult following [mass shootings at schools](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/us/schools-after-mass-shootings-uvalde-texas-back-to-school/index.html), where students and teachers face the possibility of having to return: For example, Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was [torn down and rebuilt](https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/us/sandy-hook-school-reopening/index.html) after 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old children, were killed in a shooting there in December 2012. But for decades, communities have faced similar questions about private homes, like the one in Idaho, where notorious killers lived or their victims were murdered. Often these homes are torn down, like the [Sandy Hook shooter’s home](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/us/sandy-hook-killer-home-demolished/index.html), where he lived with his mother – his first victim the day of the shooting. Here’s a look at what happened to other homes synonymous with the killings that took place there. 10050 Cielo Drive In 1969, five people, including the actress Sharon Tate, were murdered at [10050 Cielo Drive](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/entertainment/full-house-manson-estate-intl-scli/index.html) in what was perhaps the most notorious of the murders carried out by the cult led by [Charles Manson](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/us/charles-manson-dead/index.html). The Beverly Hills, California, home was demolished in 1994, and a new one — a sprawling nine-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion — was built and completed in 1996. It received a new address. The mansion was put on the market in January 2022 for $85 million, but the asking price has repeatedly dropped over the last 23 months. The sellers are now asking $49.5 million, according to the [real estate agent’s listing](https://www.thealtmanbrothers.com/listing/10066-cielo-dr-beverly-hills-ca-90210-2/), which makes no mention of the property’s dark history. John Wayne Gacy’s home The serial killer [John Wayne Gacy](https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/us/serial-killers-fast-facts/index.html) killed at least 33 people, and the remains of more than two dozen of them were found underneath his house near Chicago by investigators following his arrest in December 1978, according to the [Chicago Tribune](https://graphics.chicagotribune.com/john-wayne-gacy-new-timeline/blurb.html). Gacy’s home was demolished months later, in April 1979, the Tribune reported at the time. It was a relief to neighbors, including one who told the newspaper, “I’ll be glad when every bit of it’s gone.” The lot was empty for almost a decade, until a new home was erected on the site beginning in June 1988, per the Tribune. Like the Cielo Drive house, the new home also was given a new address. The home of Fred and Rose West [Fred and Rose West](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/04/europe/fred-rosemary-west-murders-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html) abducted, sexually abused and killed a series of girls and young women — two of their daughters among them — between the 1960s and 1980s in England. Fred, accused of 12 murders, died by suicide before he could stand trial, while Rose was convicted on 10 counts of murder in November 1995 and sentenced to life in prison. When the case broke open in the 1990s, investigators found the remains of many of their victims at their house at 25 Cromwell Street in the city of Gloucester, including in the garden, the basement and the bathroom. The home, dubbed a “house of horrors,” was [torn down in 1996](http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9610/12/house.of.horrors/). A [public walkway](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/04/europe/fred-rosemary-west-murders-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html) has since been built in its place. Alex Murdaugh’s hunting estate Before it became known as the site where [Alex Murdaugh](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/us/alex-murdaugh-sentencing-state-financial-crimes/index.html) murdered his wife, Maggie, and grown son Paul, the 1,700-acre Islandton, South Carolina, [property known as Moselle](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/us/moselle-property-alex-murdaugh-trial/index.html) was the family’s hunting estate – including a house, a cabin and dog kennels where the killings occurred. During the now-disgraced attorney’s trial earlier this year, jurors visited the estate to help them better understand the crime scene and the prosecution and defense arguments. Unlike the other crimes’ sites, however, Moselle is still standing. The estate went up for sale several months after the killings, according to [CNN affiliate WJCL](https://www.wjcl.com/article/alex-murdaugh-moselle-property-sale/39092104), and many items from the home were [auctioned off](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/us/murdaugh-moselle-estate-liberty-auction/index.html) soon after Murdaugh’s conviction. He has filed an appeal, which is on hold while his defense attorneys pursue a [motion for a new trial](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/us/alex-murdaugh-motion-granted-jury-tampering/index.html). The home was sold for $2.6 million, [another affiliate, WCIV](https://abcnews4.com/news/local/murdaugh-familys-former-home-scene-of-murders-sold-realtor-wciv-alex-murdaugh-maggie-paul-family-killed-abc-news-4-moselle-farm-road-colleton-county-sc-south-carolina-dog-kennels), reported in March.
