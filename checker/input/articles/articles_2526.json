    "title": "Alabama justice who ruled embryos are people says American law should be rooted in the Bible",
    "text": "Alabama justice who ruled embryos are people says American law should be rooted in the Bible\nOn the same day that Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Parker handed down an opinion declaring that fertilized frozen embryos are people, imperiling women’s access to in vitro fertilization treatments, he espoused support for a once-fringe philosophy that calls on evangelical Christians to reshape society based on their interpretation of the Bible.\nDuring an online broadcast hosted by Tennessee evangelist Johnny Enlow on Friday, Parker suggested America was founded explicitly as a Christian nation and discussed his embrace of the Seven Mountains Mandate — the belief that conservative Christians are meant to rule over seven key areas of American life, including media, business, education and government.\n“God created government, and the fact that we have let it go into the possession of others, it’s heartbreaking,” Parker said in the interview, first reported this week by Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit media watchdog. “That’s why he is calling and equipping people to step back into these mountains right now.”\nHours before the interview was published, Parker issued a concurring opinion in a case in which he and his fellow justices ruled that frozen embryos have the same rights as living children under Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act.\nParker wrote that Alabama had adopted a “theologically based view of the sanctity of life” and that “life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God.” To support his legal opinion, Parker repeatedly cited the book of Genesis, including a passage asserting that all people are created in God’s image.\n“Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God,” Parker wrote, “and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.”\nParker did not respond to messages requesting comment. In a written statement, Enlow said, in his view, the Seven Mountains Mandate encourages Christians to fight for their values in government and elsewhere to aid “in the healing of society.”\n“It is not sinister to desire a voice and relevance in political matters,” said Enlow, who in 2020 suggested that then-President Donald Trump could impose martial law to remain in office following his electoral defeat. “I am pretty sure that is why every citizen takes the time to vote.”\nParker’s statements — in his remarks to Enlow and in his written opinion — are the latest examples of Republican politicians and elected officials embracing the Christian nationalist view that America’s laws should be rooted in a fundamentalist reading of the Bible.\nThe Alabama chief justice’s embrace of the Seven Mountains Mandate, in particular, signaled the growing influence of a once-fringe political and religious theology that’s been spreading in recent years among certain segments of evangelical Christians, said Matthew D. Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland.\n“The Seven Mountains is not about democracy,” said Taylor, who has studied the role Christian extremism played in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “In fact, I would argue that the Seven Mountains itself is a vision that is antidemocratic.”\nAdherents of the ideology have grown in prominence and power in the years since the 2016 election, when Trump became an unlikely hero of the Christian right and cultivated relationships with celebrity pastors who preach the Seven Mountains Mandate. Parker is the latest in a line of prominent Republicans to openly embrace the concept, Taylor said.\nCharlie Kirk, the MAGA influencer and founder of Turning Point USA, celebrated the GOP’s shift under Trump when he told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020, “Finally we have a president that understands the seven mountains of cultural influence.”\nIn 2022, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado called on attendees at a political conference hosted by a group with a mission to “reform the nation via the Seven Mountains” to “rise up” and place “God back at the center of our country.”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, the nation’s highest-ranking Republican, also has ties to pastors and activists who preach the Seven Mountains. Johnson, like Parker, has aligned himself with the evangelical activist and self-styled historian David Barton, a leading promoter of the idea that America was founded as a Christian nation whose laws should reflect biblical principles.\nBarton and other Seven Mountains proponents argue that the idea of separation of church and state, regarded by many as a bedrock of American democracy, is a myth invented by progressives based on a misreading of Thomas Jefferson’s famous 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists. And any laws or court rulings limiting the influence of religion in schools and government — such as the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1962 and 1963 decisions banning mandatory public school prayer and Bible readings — are an affront to America’s true founding.\nThese ideas aren’t only gaining influence among preachers and politicians, experts say. In a survey last year, Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison University, found that about 20% of American adults — and 30% of Christians — agreed with the statement that “God wants Christians to stand atop the ‘7 mountains of society,’ including the government, education, media, and others.”\nPrior to conducting the survey, Djupe expected to discover only marginal support for the Seven Mountains concept.\n“It turns out,” he said, “a substantial number of Americans believe these things.”\nParker echoed Barton’s views about America’s founding during his interview with Enlow, after Enlow asked the chief justice to comment on the growing use of the phrase “Christian nationalism” among those who support the separation of church and state.\n“This is an undefined term that’s being thrown around now to label people, and I have no idea what they mean by or what should be meant by it,” said Parker, who then defended his view that America’s “original form of government” was based on the Bible.\n“It’s constitutional,” Parker said. “It’s our foundation.”\nThe Alabama ruling dealing with in vitro fertilization, or IVF, offers a picture of what that worldview might look like in practice and how it might affect the lives of regular citizens, Taylor said.\nAfter Parker and his colleagues issued their ruling, the state’s largest hospital paused IVF treatments while it considered the legal repercussions of the decision.\nTaylor said it was “jaw-dropping” to hear a state supreme court chief justice espousing a theology that he views as antidemocratic “while making very extreme decisions.”\nBut, he added, “this is the new reality of our politics.”\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "title": "Fostering Sustainable Fashion: The Impact of Remaking and Mending Spaces in Retail Stores",
    "text": "In an era where the clamor for sustainability intersects with the world of fashion, a recent study illuminates a promising pathway. Spearheaded by researchers from various universities, the investigation delves into the impact of incorporating spaces within chain stores dedicated to remaking and mending clothing as a means to foster sustainable clothing choices among consumers. This initiative, not only champions the ethos of environmental stewardship but also empowers individuals with the skills and discernment to make more ethical and sustainable purchases.\nRevolutionizing Retail: The Shift Towards Sustainability\nThe study reveals a marked transformation in consumer behavior, with participants reporting a broadened engagement in pro-environmental behaviors. This shift is not confined to mere awareness but extends to tangible changes in purchasing habits. The allure of fast fashion, notorious for its environmental footprint, has seen a decline among study participants. Instead, there's a gravitation towards charity shops and the selective purchase of essentials, underscoring a more conscientious approach to consumerism.\nAmidst the high street's hustle and bustle, most participants remain loyal patrons. However, their loyalty is now tinged with a newfound discernment - a keen eye for sustainability and ethical production. This discernment has propelled a decrease in fast fashion purchases, except for unavoidable essentials like underwear, highlighting a nuanced understanding of sustainable living that accommodates practical necessities.\nEmpowerment through Skill Acquisition\nOne of the study's most compelling findings is the empowerment experienced by participants through the acquisition of new skills. The initiative to provide spaces for clothing remaking and mending within chain stores has not only fostered a sense of agency among consumers but has also imbued them with the practical skills to extend the life of their garments. This empowerment transcends the realm of personal benefit, contributing to a broader environmental impact by curtailing the incessant cycle of clothing consumption and disposal.\nThe ripple effects of this empowerment are evident in the participants' buying habits. Equipped with mending skills and a heightened sense of responsibility, individuals are buying fewer items, choosing instead to invest in the longevity of their existing wardrobe. This shift represents a significant departure from the throwaway culture that has long plagued the fashion industry, heralding a new era of sustainable consumerism.\nTarget's Plus Size Section Revamp: A Case Study in Change\nIn a parallel development, Target's recent overhaul of its plus size clothing section provides a real-world example of how retail giants are responding to the call for inclusivity and sustainability. Contrary to speculations of phasing out, Target is revamping its plus size offerings, addressing the lack of new stock and the vague announcement of \"Big Changes Are Coming\" that had initially caused confusion and frustration among its clientele. This move, though criticized for its clumsy rollout, signifies a step towards accommodating a wider range of consumer needs and preferences.\nThe delay in the arrival of new spring styles at Target has sparked a dialogue on the need for transparency and sensitivity in retail communications, especially when addressing segments of the market historically marginalized. However, with the promise of contemporary options hitting the shelves before the month's end, and the availability of plus size clothing online, Target is making strides towards rectifying initial missteps and catering to the diverse needs of its customer base.\nIn conclusion, the intersecting narratives of the university-led study on sustainable clothing practices and Target's revamp of its plus size section underscore a broader shift in the retail industry. This shift, characterized by a growing commitment to sustainability, inclusivity, and consumer empowerment, reflects a deeper recognition of the role of retail in shaping a more ethical and sustainable future. As consumers become more discerning and empowered to make sustainable choices, the fashion industry is poised on the brink of a transformative era, one where the value of a garment extends far beyond its price tag, encompassing its environmental footprint, the conditions under which it was produced, and its longevity in the consumer's wardrobe.",

Pat Cummins led Australia to victory by 79 runs in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The hosts have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series. Cummins finished with a 10-wicket match haul in Australia's 79-run win while Starc returned with 4/55 and both pacers bowled a hostile spell of fast bowling to take the host to a second consecutive triumph. Pakistan fought till the last but fell short as Australia completed a solid victory. Starting the last session at 129/3, Pakistan were given some hope by Saud Shakeel and Babar Azam as both batters were decisive in their approach. In the 41st over of the game, Josh Hazlewood delivered an absolute stunner to remove well-set batter Babar for 41. When Mohammad Rizwan and Agha Salman joined for an adventurous 57-run combination, the topsy-turvy battle seemed to be heading for a dramatic finale. Pakistan were 219 for 5 and needed 98 runs for a series-levelling victory as the match seemed poised to be a cliffhanger. However, Rizwan attempted to sway out of the path of Cummins' short delivery and dropped his wrists as the ball sailed by. Rizwan looked disappointed that the DRS decision had been reversed as Cummins celebrated his 250th Test wicket. The pacer then had Aamer Jamal caught and bowled shortly after. In the next 30 or minutes of the match, Cummins went on to dismiss Shaheen Shah Afridi for his tenth wicket. It rounded off another epic effort by Cummins, who had turned the match on its head late on day two with a splendid spell that included a gem of a ball to bowled Babar Azam. Starc claimed Salman and Mir Hamza in consecutive deliveries as Pakistan were bundled out for 237. Earlier, Masood and Babar Azam led the chase with grit and determination with the bat against a vigilant Australia on Day 4. At Tea, Pakistan's score read 129/3 and they needed 188 runs for victory with Babar Azam (35) and Saud Shakeel (10) looking confident at the crease. Brief Scores: Australia 318 and 262 (Mitchell Marsh 96, Alex Carey 53, Mir Hamza 4/32) vs Pakistan 264 and 237 (Shan Masood 60, Agha Salman 50; Pat Cummins 5-49).

    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // On Dec. 26, Pope Francis opened a special Holy Door for the Jubilee 2025 at the Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of Rome, in a move that the Vatican described as “historic.”\nThe Pope stood in front of the prison’s Church of Our Father, symbolically flinged the doors open and explained to the group of inmates attending that he wanted everyone to “have the opportunity to fling open the doors to their hearts and to understand that hope never disappoints,” according to Vatican News .\n“I wanted to throw open the Door, today, here. I opened the first one to Saint Peter, the second one is yours. It is a beautiful gesture to throw open, to open: to open the doors,” Pope Francis said during the homily . “But more important is what it means: it is to open the heart. Open hearts. And this is what brotherhood does.”\n“Do not lose hope. This is the message I want to give you; to everyone, to all of us. I am the first. Everyone. Don’t lose hope. Hope never disappoints. Never,” the Pope said.\nHe also highlighted that “even in the most difficult situations – each of us has our own, easier, more difficult, I think of you – always the heart open; the heart, which is precisely what makes us brothers. Open wide the doors of the heart. Everyone knows how to do it. Everyone knows where the door is closed or half-closed. Everyone knows.”\nHe finished his homily wishing the inmates “a great Jubilee.”\n“I wish you much peace, much peace,” he said. “And every day I pray for you. Really. It’s not a figure of speech. I think of you and I pray for you. And you pray for me.”\n>> At Christmas Eve Mass, Pope Francis Announces That ‘The Door of Hope Has Opened Wide to the World’ <<",

    "text": "The man\naccused of beating a Dauphin County man to death in an illegal stripclub in Steelton Borough has been arrested in York County on unrelated charges, according to police.\nKier Sims, 33, had been on the run for a month after the death of Otilio Lugo-Rivera on 159 N. Front St. in Steelton when U.S. Marshals caught up with him Thursday and took him into custody.\nSims and Lugo-Rivera were involved in an altercation early March 23 that resulted in Sims punching Lugo-Rivera in the head, causing blunt force injuries that later killed the man, at The Hideout in Steelton.\nThe Hideout is a venue where Nathan May, under the nightlife entertainment name “Dante Labron,”\nran adult cabaret-style events without a permit from the borough. Even had he applied for the permit, the building was located in the wrong zone of the borough.\nMay’s landlord, Hernan Paredes, has been\ntrying to evict May for more than a year amid a back-and-forth landlord-tenant case.\nSims will remain in York County to resolve his charges there before being transferred to Dauphin County Prison to face a charge of criminal homicide, according to Steelton Borough Police Chief William Shaub.\nEyewitnesses told investigators that Sims got in Lugo-Rivera’s face and started the fight. The pair were eventually separated, but afterward, Sims approached Lugo-Rivera and “struck him in the head with great force. This caused Lugo-Rivera’s head to strike a wall with great force,” the Dauphin County District Attorney’s Office said.\nLugo-Rivera fell to the floor and his face turned blue, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The affidavit said Steelton police found Lugo-Rivera lying unresponsive on the floor of The Hideout while bystanders performed CPR.\nPolice were called to the scene at 5:35 a.m.\nAn autopsy found Lugo-Rivera suffered significant trauma to two portions of his brain. The injuries were consistent with the way witnesses said the fight transpired, the affidavit said. The Dauphin County Coroner’s Office on Thursday, however, told PennLive Lugo-Rivera’s official cause and manner of death are still pending additional investigation.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.
