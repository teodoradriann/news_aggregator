    "text": "The Telegraph Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain, review: our miners suffered, whether they worked or not Read full article Anita Singh January 26, 2024 at 12:01 a.m. · 2 min read Channel 4 looks at how the effects of the Miners’ Strike are still being felt today - Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy\nI was a child during the Miners’ Strike, and found it confusing. On the news were scenes of miners clashing with police, their families struggling by without money. My grandfather was by then retired but formerly a proud Co Durham miner. Yet his fiercest anger was directed not at Margaret Thatcher, or the officers dealing out truncheon blows, but at the miners’ champion, Arthur Scargill . How could that be?\nOf course, I grew up to learn that it wasn’t a simple case of two sides. Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain (Channel 4) details the schism between Scargill’s men and those who, in the absence of a national ballot, wanted to go to work. This is a well-researched documentary, featuring miners who were in news footage from the time. Both sides are given equal weight.\nIt is split into three episodes. The first, Community, maps the bitter divisions in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The BBC’s excellent 2022 drama, Sherwood , was set somewhere similar. Forty years on, positions are as fixed as ever: “If you cross a picket line,” says one man firmly, “you’re a scab.”\nWorking miners faced hatred. Miners bussed through the picket lines wore bags over their heads to hide their faces, or crash helmets in case of missiles. Sometimes it was women and children screaming abuse as they passed. Striking miners faced the police. In Derbyshire, officers wielded batons but that was nothing compared to the “Battle of Orgreave” in South Yorkshire, subject of episode two.\nThere were violent clashes between striking miners and police in Orgreave, Yorkshire - PA Mostly this is told by the miners arrested that day and the lawyers – inevitably, it’s Michael Mansfield QC and Gareth Peirce – who defended them. This episode relies on their testimonies and on powerful footage shot at the time, showing mounted police charges and violent scenes. The third episode brings a change of pace as it details the involvement of David Hart, a strange-sounding figure who appointed himself as adviser to the PM on how to end the strikes .\nFormer aides to Mrs Thatcher defend her position, but the film is very much on the miners’ side. Some loved being down the pit; others described it as hard, filthy work. But it was work. “The working man doesn’t want vast amounts of money. The working man’s not idle,” says a former NUM delegate. “All he wants to do is go to work, have enough money to go out and have a drink, for the wife and kids to be all right, to go away for a couple of weeks in the summer.” In former mining communities, those days are gone.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "The party said it would use government buying power to back agricultural businesses as it seeks to woo rural voters. Labour has pledged to ensure British produce makes up at least half of food in schools, hospitals and prisons as it set out its “new deal” for UK farmers. The party said it would use government buying power to back agricultural businesses as it seeks to woo rural voters before a general election next year. A quota-driven approach across parts of the public sector at home would run alongside Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to pursue a new veterinary agreement with the European Union, which Labour hopes would boost exports. A Cobra-style “flood resilience taskforce” would also be created to reduce the flood risk of Britain’s farms by delivering drainage systems, flood defences and natural flood management schemes, the party said. The package of measures comes as Labour claimed the Tories are presiding over “destruction” of agricultural-related businesses, with party analysis of Office for National Statistics data suggesting more than 6,300 have been terminated since 2017. The party hopes its plan for GB Energy, a new publicly owned company to invest in clean, homegrown power and make Britain energy secure, will deliver cheaper bills for farmers. It has promised to “rewire Britain” in a way that allows farmers to “rapidly plug their renewable energy into the grid”. Shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said: “This Conservative Government has wrecked our farmers. It is time we turned the page and embraced a decade of national renewal with the countryside at its heart. “Labour will give British farmers their future back. We will deliver lower energy bills for farmers by switching on GB Energy, lower red tape at our borders to get our great food exports flowing again and use the government’s own purchasing power to back British produce.” Food minister Mark Spencer said Labour has failed to support farmers in the past and would continue to do so. “Labour are incapable of supporting British farming – in government they failed to provide the connectivity, jobs and investment rural communities needed, and years later they still have no plan to support the countryside,” he said. “Meanwhile, the Conservatives have delivered better targeted funding for farmers, protecting our best farmland and speeding up our grid connections for those who need it most. “Aside from this copy-and-paste pledge to farmers, the only plan Labour have is a £28 billion a year spending splurge – unfunded spending that would mean higher taxes.”",

    "title": "Bluesky's stormy day: How its explosive growth led to inevitable outages",
    "text": "Jason Hosking/Getty Images As an active user of Bluesky, I&apos;ve witnessed the platform&apos;s remarkable growth firsthand. In recent weeks, my follower count has surged alongside the influx of many new users joining the network, reflecting a genuine demand for a fresh social media experience.\nHowever, with such rapid growth come some challenges. Today, Bluesky experienced significant strain, resulting in numerous errors and slow loading times. My experience on Bluesky today was both exciting and frustrating. Notifications slowed to a crawl, timelines took a long time to load, and I frequently encountered \"Invalid Handle\" errors. To stabilize the situation temporarily, Bluesky&apos;s technical team put the platform into read-only mode .\nThe initial service outage, which lasted about an hour, was caused by a cut fiber cable from one of Bluesky&apos;s main bandwidth providers. After connectivity was restored, issues persisted well into the evening due to a huge surge in traffic and signups. Despite these challenges, the platform ended the day by adding over 1.2 million new users, marking a record-breaking event.\nAlso: How to migrate from X to Bluesky without losing your followers\nAs a long-time observer of social media, I felt a sense of déjà vu, as the experience was reminiscent of Twitter&apos;s early years when the Fail Whale became an infamous symbol of overloaded servers .\nThe Fail Whale reimagined In a fun twist, Bluesky users have brought back the Fail Whale image on the platform, this time with playful variations . One such version features a certain lovable alien from an &apos;80s TV show , looking just as exasperated as we feel while waiting for posts to load. It&apos;s a reminder of our desire for stability on these platforms and highlights how the social media community has traditionally relied on humor to cope with technical glitches.\nWhy the struggles Bluesky&apos;s decentralized design is intended to prevent exactly this type of bottleneck. In theory, each user could host their data on their own Personal Data Server (PDS), distributing the load across a network of servers instead of relying on a single central instance. But at the moment, the reality is that most users are connected to the main bsky.social infrastructure, which is bearing the brunt of the load. While practical for a platform still finding its feet, this centralization has created bottlenecks as Bluesky&apos;s popularity skyrockets.\nBuilding a truly distributed network is not for the timid Bluesky&apos;s vision for decentralization reminds me of how the Domain Name System (DNS) operates on the internet. DNS is a globally distributed system that spreads across countless servers to handle requests, prevent single points of failure, and efficiently manage traffic. Bluesky aims to achieve something similar by allowing users and communities to host their own data through Personal Data Servers. In theory, this decentralized setup would reduce strain on central servers and help avoid the bottlenecks we&apos;re seeing currently as Bluesky&apos;s popularity skyrockets.\nSetting up a PDS is relatively accessible -- many individuals and organizations can run one, and some hosting providers, like DigitalOcean, even offer pre-built templates to streamline the setup . However, going beyond the PDS to create a complete, fully functional Bluesky instance is a different story.\nAlso: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative\nA recent developer blog post revealed that the relay component alone, which handles data streams across servers, requires nearly 5TB of storage. Add to that the need for computing power, memory, and bandwidth, and replicating the entire Bluesky infrastructure demands a level of resources and technical complexity that&apos;s out of reach for most individuals and smaller organizations.\nThis is where hyperscale cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure come in. With their massive infrastructure, these providers could offer both PDS hosting and the supporting infrastructure components Bluesky needs to scale effectively. If hyperscalers invest in supporting Bluesky&apos;s infrastructure, the platform could finally realize its decentralized vision -- creating a network that, like DNS, operates across a distributed architecture and allows data to flow smoothly between independently managed servers.\nWith this distributed setup, Bluesky could support its expanding user base without relying on a single point of failure, moving closer to becoming a resilient, user-owned social network that can truly scale with demand.\nLooking ahead As a Bluesky user, I hope the platform can overcome its technical challenges, allowing it to evolve into the decentralized, user-owned network it aims to be. With support from hyperscalers and increased adoption of PDS instances, Bluesky&apos;s future could be both scalable and resilient, capable of supporting millions of users without collapsing under pressure.\nThe Fail Whale and its Bluesky-inspired counterparts serve as a charming reminder of the platform&apos;s journey and indicate that the Bluesky team has significant scaling work ahead to keep up with its growing popularity.\nAlso: 7 things to know about Bluesky before you join - and why you should\nAs Bluesky expands, it faces the dual challenge of meeting existing demand while simultaneously building toward a decentralized future. Today&apos;s glitches reflect both progress and potential. With the right infrastructure and a commitment to a distributed model, Bluesky has the opportunity to redefine social media -- creating a platform owned by its users that can withstand surges in popularity without experiencing a single Fail Whale.\nFeatured\nHow to use your Apple Watch to predict when you may get sick\nI test AI tools for a living, and these are the only two worth paying for\nThere&apos;s a new king of online shopping, and it&apos;s built an unstoppable monopoly\nOura Ring vs. Apple Watch: Which health tracker should you buy?\nHow to use your Apple Watch to predict when you may get sick\nI test AI tools for a living, and these are the only two worth paying for\nThere&apos;s a new king of online shopping, and it&apos;s built an unstoppable monopoly\nOura Ring vs. Apple Watch: Which health tracker should you buy?
