    "title": "OFICIAL: Adalberto Carrasquilla es nuevo jugador de Pumas para el Clausura 2025",
    "text": "Los Pumas de la UNAM tienen nuevo refuerzo, esto después de que hicieron oficial el fichaje del panameño Adalberto Carrasquilla.\nMediante un comunicado, el conjunto auriazul le dio la bienvenida al centrocampista canalero, que llega en compra definitiva proveniente del Houston Dynamo, de la MLS.\n“Carrasquilla estará ligado al Club Universidad Nacional con un contrato de larga duración y se integrará de forma inmediata a los entrenamientos del conjunto auriazul, para ponerse a disposición del entrenador Gustavo Lema y sumar sus primeros minutos como jugador de Pumas en este Clausura 2025″, informó el cuadro universitario mediante un boletín de prensa.\nDe esta manera, el Coco se convierte en el segundo refuerzo de los felinos, tras el arribo de Álex Padilla, que peleará por la titularidad en la portería con el canterano Pablo Lara.\n¿Qué aportará Carrasquilla a Pumas?\nEl centrocampista panameño se caracteriza por tener un juego bastante dinámico con una gran visión de campo y buen desequilibrio. De hecho, llega con altas expectativas al balompié mexicano, ya que fue nombrado el Jugador del Año en la Concacaf en la temporada 2023-2024, por encima de jugadores como Christian Pulisic y Alphonso Davies.\n¿Cuándo debutará?\nTras haber superado los exámenes médicos, el jugador panameño apenas se incorporará a los trabajos de entrenamiento, por lo que resulta imposible que tenga actividad en la fecha 2.\nPor tal motivo, es probable que sea convocado para la jornada 3, en la que Pumas recibirá a los rojinegros del Atlas en el Estadio Olímpico Universitario, el domingo 26 de enero.",

    "title": "Alberta Premier Smith's blame on health agency chilling: emergency doctor",
    "text": "EDMONTON - The former head of the Alberta Medical Association says Premier Danielle Smith’s latest finger pointing at the province’s front-line health agency has created a “draconian” chill among workers.\nDr. Paul Parks, an emergency physician, says he’s heard from scores of health workers across Alberta who felt intimidated by the premier’s harsh critique this week of Alberta Health Services.\n“From front-line physicians, nurses, health-care workers, up to senior leadership — everybody heard the premier of the province saying that they suck, that they don’t do a good job and that they’re not valuable,” he said Thursday.\nSome have even felt too intimidated to engage with his social media posts for fear of losing their jobs, he said.\n“We’re going to find ourselves in a situation in Alberta where there’s nobody willing to speak out and to actually try to advocate for patients in the system, because it’s that draconian.”\nSmith has denied any wrongdoing in response to allegations of government interference in lucrative medical contracts.\nAt a news conference Wednesday, she accused AHS leadership of stymieing the government’s mission to expand publicly funded, private surgical delivery. She also said AHS’s internal contracting processes are too opaque.\nIn a lawsuit filed last week, the former head of AHS, Athana Mentzelopoulos, alleged she was fired for looking into questionable contracts pushed by government officials as high up as the premier’s office.\nThe suit alleges government officials pressured her to sign off on contracts with surgical facilities at unjustified, inflated prices, potentially leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for private clinic owners.\nSmith said she and Health Minister Adriana LaGrange weren’t involved in awarding the contracts at the centre of allegations, and the premier accused AHS leadership of stalling.\nThe government is in the middle of massive restructuring that would see four new governing health agencies in place of AHS, with AHS reduced to a service provider.\nSmith said AHS would rather keep all surgeries in its hospitals, “either because of ideology, or to protect their interests.”\nAlthough Smith and LaGrange didn’t name Mentzelopoulos on Wednesday, Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said the implication was clear.\n“They implied that she was let go because she was dragging her feet on a government priority and wasn’t giving information to the health minister as requested,” he said.\nThe premier’s office did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\nThe government plans for AHS to conduct an internal review, along with an investigation by an unnamed external third party.\nDan Scott, the lawyer for Mentzelopoulos, rejected the implication that she stood against chartered surgical facilities and was resisting expansion.\nIn an email, he said concerns Mentzelopoulos raised last year were about making sure there was proper due diligence before finalizing the contracts for two new chartered surgical facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge.\nMentzelopoulos also alleges in the lawsuit that high-ranking staff in the Health Ministry, as well as Smith’s former chief of staff Marshall Smith, pressured her to fire AHS employees who were critical of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith called Mentzelopoulos multiple times last summer, demanding certain employees be fired because “‘powerful people’ were upset and angry” over their social media activity.\nOne employee was political podcaster and paramedic Nate Pike, who is now facing a $6-million defamation lawsuit from one of the companies at the heart of the scandal, MHCare.\nThat company’s ill-fated $70-million contract to import children’s pain medication in 2022 resulted in delivery of 30 per cent of the order.\nMultiple United Conservative Party cabinet ministers have said they accepted luxury box suite tickets to Edmonton Oilers playoff games last year courtesy of MHCare and its CEO, Sam Mraiche.\nThe Mentzelopoulos lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith told her if she didn’t fire Pike she would “look very bad” and face “consequences.”\n“This type of call from Smith was not unique,” the lawsuit says, adding Mentzelopoulos had also been pressured by a deputy minister to fire from AHS three “purported critics” of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges the premier’s former chief of staff also called Mentzelopoulos about an anonymous X account, using the name Hansard the Cat, that had been critical of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith outlined steps to be taken to determine the identity of the person, such as hiring private detectives.\nMarshall Smith left the government last fall. Last week, he said the allegations were “outrageous and false” and that he’s eager to meet with investigators.\nMHCare’s lawyer has said any allegations of wrongdoing by the company are “unwarranted and unjustified.”\nParks said some health workers “have seen their colleagues fired and walked out the door” for engaging with social media commentary.\nHe added the government can’t investigate itself or get to the bottom of all the allegations, including worker intimidation.\n“No one body can do all that — unless it’s truly a judicial public inquiry — and nobody will have any faith in the outcome,” he said.\nThe premier has long railed against AHS, criticizing it for mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and for being bloated with too much middle management.\nParks said AHS isn’t the same agency it was before the premier took office, replacing the board twice and the CEO three times.\nBratt said the premier’s attempt to reframe the narrative missed the mark by casting blame on AHS for getting in the way of health reform.\n“This isn’t about reforming. This is about political interference in health-care contracts,” he said.\nAlberta’s auditor general is also looking into contracting and procurement at both AHS and the health department.\nWhile Premier Smith has resisted calls for a judicial public inquiry, Bratt said eventually her government may not have a choice.\n“I just believe they’re delaying the inevitable.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 20, 2025.",

    "title": "Israelis are fearing the storm. Palestinian citizens fear the calm that follows",
    "text": "I’m standing in line to buy a radio. I already bought flashlights, batteries, a generator, and whatever else my wife wrote on our “war shopping list.” But if Israel goes to war with Iran, and the internet gets cut off, then I must have a radio to stay connected with the outside world. The line in the store is long and somber. Everyone wears their fear and anxiety on their faces. We look like extras in one of those apocalyptic movies about the end of the world. “Israel is fighting for its very existence — otherwise there will be a new Holocaust.” This is the sentiment I hear in the conversations taking place around me in the line. If there is one thing my therapist taught me, it is to try to understand people’s fear without judgment. But their existential dread belies the fact that Israel maintains one of the strongest militaries in the world. And whereas on the eve of the Holocaust, the United States turned away the MS St. Louis, full of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, today the United States arms Israel to the teeth. In my gut, I feel a different fear from those around me. Maybe I’m too cynical, maybe I’m in denial, or maybe I just belong to the generation that thinks major regional wars belong only in history textbooks. But my fear is something else, which the Jewish Israelis standing in line cannot understand: not war so much as the calm that follows; not the roar of the fighter planes, but the silence they leave in their wake; not Iran, Hezbollah, or the two combined, but what Israel will be like on the “day after.” After the current genocide ends — if it ever ends — we Palestinian citizens of Israel will be living in a society full of young people who spent the past year fighting in Gaza, where there are no restrictions or regulations on what they can do to Palestinians. We are to live beside the people who sexually abused Palestinian prisoners in the notorious Sde Teiman prison without punishment; beside the right-wing extremists who called them heroes and rallied to their defense; and beside the cowardly “leftists” who simply prefer that they don’t do such things “while the Hague is watching.” We will be forced to live alongside hundreds of thousands of newly armed civilians, with M-16s slung over their shoulders and pistols tucked into their waistbands thanks to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s expansion of gun licenses . History tells us they won’t hesitate to open fire on anyone who vaguely “arouses their suspicion” — certainly Palestinians, but also Ethiopians, asylum seekers, and Mizrahim. That was already the situation long before October 7, when Israeli settlers shot dead my neighbor Musa Hassuna, a 31-year-old father of two, during the events of May 2021 in Lod/Lydd. Those responsible were never even investigated, despite the fact that the killers of Yigal Yehoshua, a 56-year-old Jewish-Israeli murdered by Palestinians that same day, were charged with terrorism. So we will continue to live in a society where the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” has been revised to “Thou shalt not kill Jews.” And forget the Palestinians (as usual): the men who are currently slaughtering Gazans for sport will surely bring that violence back home, abusing women and children, and fighting in bars or over parking spots. One night back in May 2021, I got a text message from the authorities informing me: “There is a curfew in the city, stay home.” I was out driving to the shop to pick up the items on my wife’s Armageddon shopping list. On the way, I came across an armed Jewish settler, so I put on my Yankees cap and approached him with my best New York accent (thank you, hip-hop, for that gift). “What’s up man – I heard there’s a curfew,” I said to him. “Nah man, it’s not for us, we’re safe,” he responded, failing to see through my disguise. I drove home and just minutes later, dozens of armed settlers flooded my neighborhood, screaming “Death to Arabs.” If they approached our home, I wouldn’t be able to defend myself, my wife and two children: the only weapons I own are the pen, paper, and microphone. Most read on +972 I called the police — the same police funded by my taxes, and who I could see from my window were protecting the setters calling for my death — not to ask for help, but to document the call. After I explained that there were armed men roaming around the city and violating the curfew, all while under police protection, they hung up on me , as if to say “Deal with it yourself.” Nowadays, I need my therapist to help guide me through these dark times, and to advise me how to handle my fears without invalidating the fears of the people who are standing in line with me. But even though we are together in fear, we are not in the same boat. “The war will end. The leaders will shake hands. The old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son. The girl will wait for her beloved husband. And those children will wait for their hero father. I don’t know who sold our homeland. But I saw who paid the price.” — Mahmoud Darwish",

    "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit. World App, the first native [Worldcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/worldcoin/) ( [WLD](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/worldcoin-org-wld/)) wallet, has reached the milestone of [10 million users](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/tfh-world-app-passes-10-million-users) in less than 12 months from its launch. As the first wallet compatible with World ID, the World App significantly contributes to providing accessible, self-custodial wallet services worldwide. The team launched the World App in May 2023, quickly gaining momentum with 4 million downloads by November. Now, the app serves users across more than 160 countries, with 2 million engaging daily and facilitating over 70 million transactions. The growth has firmly positioned the app among the top self-custodial wallets globally, showcasing its capacity with an average of 7.1 transactions per second. Tiago Sada, Head of Product at TFH, shared excitement about the milestone, focusing on its tangible impact. He said: “Reaching this milestone demonstrates the potential of making the fundamental technologies of Ethereum accessible and user-friendly. The World App represents our dedication to simplicity and functionality in the crypto domain.” The World App aims to simplify crypto interactions by focusing on the essential functions of Worldcoin and Ethereum. It enables users to authenticate their identity with World ID, execute global transactions without fees, engage in crypto token swaps, and access Worldcoin Grants in many areas. The app accommodates a broad user base, supports most mobile devices, provides gasless transactions, and offers 24/7 support in over 10 languages. Remco Bloemen, head of blockchain at the Worldcoin Foundation, praised World App’s success as an entry point for further adoption and innovation within the Worldcoin ecosystem. He added that he looks forward to the development of more wallets to suit varying user preferences, reflecting the Worldcoin community’s goal for greater decentralization and accessibility. A notable instance of the app’s impact comes from Kenya, where a World App user purchased a goat using Worldcoin. The story garnered attention and support from the crypto community, leading to donations that allowed the user to acquire additional livestock. Sada said: “Such stories vividly illustrate the life-changing potential of cryptocurrency. Our vision is to enable similar empowering experiences on a global scale.” With the World App now serving over 10 million users, TFH continues to illustrate the broad possibilities of crypto in enhancing global economic engagement. The development comes amid a backdrop of [regulatory concerns](https://cryptoslate.com/worldcoin-clarifies-legality-issues-following-spains-ban/) regarding Worldcoin’s biometric data collection practices in several countries, including [Kenya](https://cryptoslate.com/kenyan-authorities-claim-worldcoins-activities-amount-to-espionage/). Worldcoin recently made a lot of its code [open-source](https://cryptoslate.com/worldcoin-foundation-makes-orb-software-open-source/) in an effort to be more transparent about its data collection. The project has also undergone a [security audit](https://cryptoslate.com/trail-of-bits-completes-worldcoin-security-audits-finds-no-vulnerabilities/) and r [eceived praised](https://cryptoslate.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-praises-worldcoins-data-privacy-focus-amid-regulatory-scrutiny/) from industry magnates.

    "text": "Chris Forbrich, who chaired the advisory committee for the county's Small, Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises program, is alleged to have called Clay-Flores a \"crusading cunt of a commissioner\" in conversation at a July 10 Frost Bank Center event, Texas Public Radio reports . Ahead of Tuesday's vote, Forbrich told commissioners his comment was made in private, according to the radio station. \"Well, I think there's a learning opportunity here to have a discussion about what protected political speech means in the context of a private citizen in a private conversation that may be in the public square,\" Forbrich said. Forbrich also called attention to the abrupt nature of his expulsion from the committee, which is tasked with helping woman-owned businesses grow. According to TPR, Forbrich stated that he \"did not have the due process to prepare\" for the committee's decision. Clay-Flores has served on Commissioners Court since January 2021 and won May's Democratic primary runoff. In November, she'll face off against Republican challenger Lina Prado. Ahead of Tuesday's vote, Clay-Flores read a statement calling the court a \"good old boys club,\" explaining that she's encountered frequent sexism and received little support from colleagues in addressing it. \"As the only woman on the court, I have publicly said before that I have experienced sexism and racism in this very seat from people who have come up and spoke at that very mic, \" Flores said, \"and I did not feel that my male colleagues defended me or said anything about me.\" The vote to remove Forbrich was unanimous. Though it's unclear from press reports what prompted the derogatory remark, Clay-Flores said in her statement that they might be in response to her attempts to remove members of the committee who may have conflicts of interest.

    "text": "Copa del Rey\nEl Atlético se toma la revancha y tumba al Real Madrid en la prórroga de octavos de Copa del Rey\nUn golazo de Griezmann y otro de Riquelme golpean a los blancos, que fueron siempre a remolque en el marcador a pesar de dominar.\nPublicidad\nEl derbi comenzó con la intensidad que terminó el anterior, hace tan solo una semana. Máxima igualdad en un inicio de partido abierto, con peligro por abos lados.\nCon el paso de los minutos, los blancos se fueron apoderando de la posesión del balón y del peso del encuentro. Un gran Bellingham marcaba el ritmo del ataque de los de Ancelotti.\nSin embargo, tras un par de ocasiones blancas, el Atlético se iba adelantar en el marcador de la eliminatoria por medio de Samuel Lino, que batía a un Lunin que no estuvo acertado en la noche de hoy.\nEra el minuto 39 de partido, pero el Madrid igualó el marcador justo antes del descanso gracias a un error de Oblak. El portero rojiblanco no midió bien su salida e un balón parado. Ahora si, el partido se iba con tablas al descanso. Mucha intensidad y pocas tarjetas, que vendrían en el segundo tiempo.\nNo fue la noche de los porteros\nTras la reanudación el Madrid tuvo varias, pero no acertó sobre la meta del esloveno. Sería Morata en el 57' quien adelantaría de nuevo a los rojiblancos tras un error de Lunin. Los de Simeoe volvían a ponerse arriba por la mínima, pero quedaba mucho partido. El Madrid lo iba a seguir intentando.\nAncelotti movió el banquillo dando entrada a Brahim Díaz, Tchouameni, Kroos y Joselu. Seríe este último quien volvería a empatar la eliminatoria en el minuto 82. El partido se iba a decidir en la prórroga.\nY apareció Griezmann en el 100'\nEl francés volvió a ser decisivo el día de su homenaje por convertirse en mayor goleador de la historia del Atlético de Madrid. Griezmann aprovechó un error de Vinícius para marcharse por línea de fondo y batir a Lunin con un gran zurdazo que se coló por la escuadra.\nPublicidad",

    "text": "Washington is set to face Texas in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day, closing out the opening round of the\nCollege Football Playoff.\nA few Huskies gave the Longhorns some bulletin board material in the pregame leadup.\nMichael Penix was one of a number of UW players asked about a UT defensive line that anchors the Big XII’s top-ranked defense. That group bolstered a run defense that surrendered the\nthird-least rushing yards in the nation while getting after opposing quarterbacks in the passing game by averaging 2.5 sacks per contest.\nHere’s what Penix had to say about that front four.\n[#Washington]QB Michael Penix Jr. on facing [#Texas]‘ defensive line anchored by 2023 Outland Trophy winner [@TvondreSweat]and [#Big12]D-Lineman OTY [@ByronMurphyII]: “They play good ball, but I wouldn’t say we’re playing the 49ers’ D-line or the Eagles’ D-line, so we’ll be good.”\n— Chip Brown (@ChipBrown247)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“They play good ball, but I wouldn’t say we’re playing the 49ers’ D-line or the Eagles’ D-line, so we’ll be good.”\nNot outright disrespect, but Penix is certainly downplaying the group’s potential impact on the game.\nHuskies running back Dillon Johnson sang a similar tune when\nasked the same question, though he did so without the backhanded jab.\n“I played in the SEC. It’s nothing new to me. I’ve played Bama and Georgia. I’m used to it. I’m ready for it.”\nJohnson is a former Mississippi State Bulldog, so he’s seen strong defensive line play before. Will Texas compare to those SEC defensive lines of Johnson’s past?\nIt should certainly be a matchup of strength vs. strength.\nThe Washington offense has been electric throughout the year, led by their quarterback, who paces the nation in passing. The offensive line has been able to keep him upright, having allowed just 11 sacks on the season.\nThe Texas defense will be looking to slow that attack, and it will start at the line of scrimmage. Who will win out?\nYou can bet these words will be on the Longhorns’ minds as the front four looks to make its presence felt come playoff time.",
