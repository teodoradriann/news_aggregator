    "text": "Telangana\nTelangana govt extends Rs 5 lakh accident insurance to gig workers\nTelangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy announced the extension of accident insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh to gig and platform workers in a move to provide social security to the workers. Under this initiative, which is a part of the 'Rajiv Arogyasri' scheme, cab drivers, food delivery drivers, and autorickshaw drivers can avail of benefits.\nA Government Order Ms 31 was issued on Saturday, December 30, extending the social security scheme to include gig and platform workers under the coverage provided by the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008 (Central Act No 33 of 2008). The scheme covering transport and non-transport auto drivers, home guards, and working journalists will now benefit the workforce operating in the gig economy.\nThe Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) thanked the government for issuing orders as promised.\nOn December 23, Revanth Reddy met several cab and autorickshaw drivers and food delivery agents in Hyderabad and assured that the state government would carefully study the existing policy for gig workers in Rajasthan and incorporate effective measures in the upcoming Telangana budget session. He also said that the government was planning to launch an application for gig platforms to ensure the protection of workers' rights.\nHe directed officials to extend financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to the family of a 23-year-old Rizwan, a Swiggy delivery agent who tragically lost his life after being chased by a dog and falling from the top of a building on January 14, this year.",

    "title": "On Christmas Eve, Bethlehem resembles a ghost town. Celebrations are halted due to Israel-Hamas war | The Business Standard",
    "text": "The normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus resembled a ghost town on Sunday, as Christmas Eve celebrations in Bethlehem were called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrolled the empty square. The gift shops were slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did once the rain had stopped pouring down. There were few visitors, however. \"This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there's just darkness,\" said Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years. He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, reminiscent of the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounded the scene, the grey rubble reflecting none of the joyous lights and bursts of color that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. \"We can't justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don't even have houses to go to,\" said Ala'a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square. Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. \"Normally, you can't find a single chair to sit, we're full from morning till midnight,\" said Salameh. This year, just one table was taken, by journalists taking a break from the rain. Salameh said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and wasn't able to cover operating costs. He estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town's economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem's income — almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines canceling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say over 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel's air and ground offensive against Gaza's Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory's 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas' deadly assault Oct. 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",

    "text": "Jay May didn't recognize the three people who stood next to him near the lectern Thursday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, but he knew why they were there.\n\"I am only here because these folks are here,\" May said during an event arranged by airport officials to allow him to meet the travelers who helped save his life after he went into cardiac arrest at the airport last summer. \"I want to say thank you. I consider myself one of the luckiest people on Earth.\"\nCardiac arrest is a condition that causes a victim to lose consciousness, and the heart stops, making CPR necessary. An automated external defibrillator (AED) can be used to shock the heart back into rhythm. Only about 10% of victims survive, said Dr. Haitham Hussein, president of the board of directors for the American Heart Association Twin Cities. Odds of survival double or triple if care is administered in the first few minutes.\nMark Kortesma, a fire captain in Duluth, and his wife, Kirsten, and Kyle Menzel, a physician from Hermantown, Minn., knew how to do CPR. On July 28 at about 9:30 p.m., they were standing near carousel No. 8 when May blacked out and fell to the floor. The trio rushed to his aid and used a defibrillator to give May's heart two shocks and chest compressions by hand until help arrived.\nFor their efforts, Hussein on Thursday presented them with the Heartsaver Hero Award, given for \"performing the heroic act of CPR\" during cardiac emergencies.\n\"Thank you for jumping into action and saving Jay's life. You are inspiring,\" Hussein said. \"We can transform a nation of bystanders into a nation of lifesavers.",

Este lunes 15, día propio de la festividad de San Amaro, la fiesta comenzará con la actuación de la charanga [NBA](https://www.farodevigo.es/tags/baloncesto/) en la Plaza de San Amaro. Luego, a las 12.00 horas, se celebrará la misa solemne cantada por la Coral Casablanca. También habrá misas a las 9.00, 10.00, 11.00, 17.00 y 18.00 horas.",

    "text": "Reuters Panama ex-president's return to office endangered by graft sentence Read full article Valentine Hilaire and Elida Moreno February 2, 2024 at 2:04 a.m. · 2 min read\nBy Valentine Hilaire and Elida Moreno\n(Reuters) - Panama's ex-president Ricardo Martinelli is hoping to convince voters to give him a second chance in an election on May 5, but a decade-long prison sentence for money laundering could imperil his run.\nMartinelli's candidacy could implode if Panama's top court upholds a 128-month prison sentence for money laundering handed down last year for his role in a case known as \"New Business,\" which alleges public funds were used to buy a media conglomerate and give him a majority stake.\nHis lawyers announced they would appeal the sentence in a press conference held hours after the ruling was published in July last year, denying that the former president had used public funds for the transaction.\nPanama's constitution bars from the presidency anyone condemned to a prison sentence of five years or more.\nOne of Martinelli's lawyers, Carlos Carrillo, told Reuters the defense expects the court to accept the appeal, adding that even a rejection would not rule out his candidacy immediately.\nMartinelli said on X this week that he would be \"happy to\" pass on his votes to running mate Jose Raul Mulino if he is barred, arguing his party would win under that scenario too.\nMartinelli, a multimillionaire supermarket magnate, held office from 2009 to 2014 after a campaign in which he called himself \"the crazy man\" and vowed to make all changes needed to lift Panama's fortunes.\nHe is running now since Panamanian law obliges ex-presidents to wait for a decade until seeking a second term.\nHe exited the post with an approval rating of over 60%, but many judicial cases were filed against him soon after. Martinelli claimed in social media posts he was the target of political persecution.\nMartinelli was arrested in Miami, where he had since moved, in the midst of an investigation by Panamanian authorities into alleged political espionage. He was then extradited to Panama and spent about one year in jail, but was ultimately acquitted.\nStory continues The United States last year barred Martinelli and his immediate family from entering the country, accusing him of accepting bribes in exchange for improperly awarding government contracts during his tenure as president.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the ban on the same day two of Martinelli's sons completed a U.S. prison sentence for acting as intermediaries for bribes from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht to a Panamanian official while their father was president.\nU.S. ambassador to Panama Mari Carmen Aponte said in a television interview that the U.S. government will work with the president chosen by Panamanians. Time was needed for local judicial authorities to resolve Martinelli's ongoing case, she said.\n(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire and Elida Moreno; Editing by Christian Plumb)\nTRENDING 1.
