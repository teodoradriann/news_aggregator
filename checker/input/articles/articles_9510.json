    "text": "Tinder Plot? New Jersey woman offered $12k to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter\nJaclyn Diiorio, 26, is accused of offering $12,000 to a Tinder match to kill her ex-boyfriend, a Philadelphia police officer, and his daughter. She was arrested and faces a detention hearing.\nIn Short\n- NJ woman accused of murder-for-hire plot\n- Diiorio offered $12,000 to kill ex and his daughter\n- Used Tinder alias 'D' to contact informant\nA New Jersey woman is accused of attempting to hire a man she met on the dating app Tinder to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter. The Camden County Prosecutor’s Office issued a press release announcing the arrest of 26-year-old Jaclyn Diiorio.\nAccording to court documents, Diiorio allegedly offered $12,000 to an informant she met on Tinder to kill her ex-boyfriend — a Philadelphia police officer in his 50s — and his 19-year-old daughter.\nUsing the alias “D” on the app, Diiorio first met the informant on March 31 in Runnemede, New Jersey. In the days that followed, they exchanged texts and phone calls. During these communications, she reportedly revealed her intent to have her ex-boyfriend killed.\nOn April 3, the Major Crimes Unit was alerted to the murder-for-hire plot. The Philadelphia police officer later confirmed that Diiorio was his ex-girlfriend and had previously been his barber. The relationship ended on March 6, 2025.\nOn April 4, Diiorio met the informant again on the 1300 block of North Black Horse Pike in Gloucester Township. She handed him $500 in cash as an initial payment. The rest of the money was to be paid in installments. Shortly after, Diiorio was arrested by Gloucester Township Police.\nShe is currently being held at the Camden County Correctional Facility and is scheduled for a detention hearing on April 9 in Superior Court.",

    "text": "Winter frosts will create big problems for drivers, especially those who have old and worn-out batteries in their cars. If your battery drains quickly in cold temperatures, it may be time to replace it. However, if you’re not ready to take this step yet, there is an easy way to improve the situation.\nWhy does the battery discharge in cold weather?\nIf you are interested in the question of why your car battery discharges on frosty days, then the answer lies in the chemical processes occurring inside. The optimal temperature for the battery is about 20-25 degrees Celsius. In such conditions, he works with full dedication.\nThe lower the temperature, the slower the electrochemical reactions occur, causing the battery to lose efficiency.\nAt temperatures around -10°C the battery only works at 80%. your strength. In severe frosts, battery efficiency can drop to 50-60%. But the problems don’t end there – a very cold engine is more difficult to start, it has more resistance, and the starter does not have as much power as at higher temperatures. All this means that the greatest load on the battery occurs on frosty days, which can lead to its discharge.\nHow to help the battery start the car in cold weather? There is one trick\nHowever, all is not lost. There is a simple trick that will help you start your car in the cold. Experienced mechanics know that to do this it is necessary to turn on the low beam a couple of tens of seconds before turning the key. Thanks to this, the battery “wakes up” before it is heavily loaded. Thus, electrochemical processes begin to occur before the engine starts, and not during it.\nHowever, be sure to turn off the lights before starting the engine.\nAnd here is a\nvideo of an experiment that proves the effectiveness of this trick:\nAnother trick from the 90s\nThere is another simple way to cope with a “difficult start”. If your battery doesn’t perform well on frosty mornings, if you have to charge it often, and if your car is used mostly for short distances, it’s worth using a method that was popular in the 80s and 90s. It involves removing the battery and storing it at home overnight. Thanks to this, in the morning, after reinstallation, the battery will work at full capacity.\nOf course, this method requires time. However, a warmed-up battery will certainly cope with starting the car in the morning better than one that was exposed to sub-zero temperatures all night. If you have an important meeting in the morning and your battery has failed you more than once, perhaps using this trick is a better solution than suffering with the engine in the morning.\nTelegraph previously wrote that low temperatures began to affect the operation of machines. Cars are starting to freeze, which means scrapers and de-icers are back in fashion. However, if almost everyone copes with the external consequences of a drop in temperature, only a few cope with those invisible to the eye, but no less important.\nHow do you like the news?",

    "text": "Now that you’ve completed your Fantasy football drafts, the true fun begins as you tinker with your Week 1 Fantasy football lineups. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua was a Fantasy football waiver wire pickup for most players last season, but now he’s a plug-and-play WR1 whom you likely spent a second-round pick on. However, Nacua was at his most productive when Cooper Kupp was out of the lineup early in the season, so might there be any reason for concern with the second-year receiver in the Week 1 Fantasy football rankings?\nWith a reliable set of Week 1 Fantasy football WR rankings, you can gauge Kupp’s matchup against the Lions and figure out if he belongs in your starting lineup. Before you lock in your Week 1 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 1 Fantasy football position rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine .\nWhen it comes to ranking players, SportsLine’s model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home emptyhanded.\nThe same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown , Jonathan Taylor , Derrick Henry , Christian McCaffrey , Alvin Kamara , and Jahmyr Gibbs . Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.\nNow, SportsLine has simulated the entire Week 1 NFL schedule 10,000 times and released its latest Week 1 Fantasy football rankings. Head to SportsLine now to see them .\nTop Week 1 Fantasy football QB rankings Here’s a look at SportsLine’s top Week 1 Fantasy football QB picks for Sunday and Monday:\n1. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills: Allen has finished first in CBS Sports PPR scoring among Fantasy football quarterbacks three times and second once over the last four years. He’s accounted for at least two touchdowns in 18 consecutive games now including the postseason and that’s a trend the model sees continuing against a Cardinals defense that ranked 31st in points allowed last season.\n2. C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans: In two games against the Colts last season, Stroud threw for 648 yards and four touchdowns. He also averaged 8.9 yards per pass attempt and threw 17 of his 23 touchdown passes as a rookie at home. He’ll open the season at home against Indianapolis.\n3. Baker Mayfield, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The former No. 1 overall pick revived his career in Tampa Bay last season, throwing for 4,044 yards and 28 touchdowns with only 10 interceptions. Then in the postseason, he was even better, throwing for 686 yards and six touchdowns while nearly leading the Bucs to the NFC championship game. He’ll begin his season against last year’s worst pass defense (Washington). See more top QBs here .\nTop Week 1 Fantasy football RB rankings Here’s a look at SportsLine’s top Week 1 Fantasy football RB picks:\n1. Christian McCaffrey, San Francisco 49ers : The Jets were stingy against the pass last season (second in the NFL) but ranked just 25th against the run. He outscored every other Fantasy football running back by at least 100 points in PPR leagues last season and he’s an automatic start as long as he’s healthy.\n2. Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts : Taylor led the NFL in rushing yards, scrimmage yards and total touchdowns in 2021 but has missed 13 games over the last two seasons. However, he’s healthy entering this season and the Texans allowed 19 rushing touchdowns (sixth-most in the NFL) in 2023.\n3. Bijan Robinson , Atlanta Falcons : Arthur Smith’s utilization of the No. 8 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft was puzzling at times in 2023 but Robinson still finished with 1,463 scrimmage yards and eight touchdowns as a rookie. He should see a heavy workload with Zac Robinson calling the plays and the Steelers ranked 19th in the NFL in run defense last season. See more top RBs here .\nTop Week 1 Fantasy football WR rankings Here’s a look at SportsLine’s top Week 1 Fantasy football WR picks:\n1. Tyreek Hill , Miami Dolphins : Hill left Kansas City and answered critics who claimed he was a system receiver by catching 238 passes for 3,509 yards and 20 touchdowns the last two seasons. He’ll match up against a Jaguars pass defense that ranked 26th in the NFL last season to open the year.\n2. Amon-Ra St. Brown , Detroit Lions : St. Brown is already one of the NFL’s biggest overachievers and he is coming off a season where he earned first-team All-Pro honors after catching 119 passes for 1,515 yards and 10 touchdowns. The Lions will play the Rams in a rematch of an NFL Wild Card matchup a season ago and St. Brown had seven catches for 110 yards in that Detroit victory.\n3. Justin Jefferson , Minnesota Vikings : Sure, Sam Darnold is a downgrade from Kirk Cousins but Jefferson’s productivity was even better when Cousins was out of the lineup in 2023. He’ll take on a Giants squad that ranked 19th in the NFL in pass defense in 2023. See more top WRs here .\nTop Week 1 Fantasy football TE rankings Here’s a look at SportsLine’s top Week 1 Fantasy football TE picks:\n1. Sam LaPorta , Detroit Lions: LaPorta caught 86 passes for 889 yards and 10 touchdowns (most among NFL tight ends) as a rookie and the reports out of Lions training camp are that he’ll be even more involved in 2023. He caught a touchdown pass in the playoff win over Los Angeles in January.\n2. Taysom Hill , New Orleans Saints : Hill set new career-highs in receptions (33) and receiving yards (291) last season but that’s a relatively small aspect of how his value is derived. He regularly lines up as New Orleans’ wildcat quarterback and rushed for 501 yards and four touchdowns while also throwing for 83 yards and a score in 2023.\n3. Dalton Kincaid , Buffalo Bills: Kincaid caught 73 passes for 673 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie and Josh Allen seemed to rely on him more and more as the season went on. With Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis gone, he could be Buffalo’s top target in the passing game and the Cardinals allowed touchdowns to TEs in seven of their last 10 games. See more top TEs here .\nTop Week 1 Fantasy football defense rankings Here’s a look at SportsLine’s top three Week 1 Fantasy football D/ST picks:\n1.Giants D/ST: Justin Jefferson will inevitably get his (see above) but the Giants are a tough matchup for a turnover-prone journeyman quarterback like Darnold. The Giants forced a league-leading 31 turnovers in 2023 and Darnold has 56 interceptions and 38 fumbles in 66 career games.\n2. 49ers D/ST: Aaron Rodgers is back but this 49ers defense is healthy again and absolutely loaded. They ranked third in the NFL in scoring defense and fifth in takeaways. The front seven should pose issues for a Jets offensive line that allowed 64 sacks last year.\n3. Vikings D/ST: Saquon Barkley left in free agency and the Giants weren’t able to address their quarterback situation this offseason. Daniel Jones had two passing touchdowns and threw six interceptions in six starts last year and that makes Minnesota a strong streaming candidate in Week 1.

    "text": "Comença a no ser notícia que el planeta estigui per sobre del llindar d'1,5 graus d'escalfament. De fet, aquest febrer s'ha encadenat el dinovè dels darrers 20 mesos amb aquesta circumstància. Una de les conseqüències directes de tant temps amb temperatures globals anòmales és la disminució del gel polar. Aquest febrer, segons les dades de Copèrnicus, s'ha assolit un mínim històric per sota dels dos darrers anys.\nTot el febrer per sota el mínim històric\nEl pitjor any per a l'extensió del gel marí al conjunt dels dos pols havia estat el 2023. Després d'una certa recuperació el 2024, enguany es va produir un punt d'inflexió a inicis de febrer, segons les dades del Servei de Canvi Climàtic de Copèrnicus. L'extensió diària s'ha situat al llarg d'aquest per sota del rècord de fa dos anys).\nEn el cas de l'Àrtic, el febrer ha encadenat el tercer rècord mensual seguit i s'ha situat un 8% menys que la mitjana del 1991-2020. A l'Antàrtida, per la seva banda, malgrat no ser el pitjor registre mensual -el quart d'ençà que hi ha registres-, està un 26% per sota de l'habitual.\nEl tercer febrer més càlid (malgrat la Niña)\nEl febrer de 2025 es va tancar amb una temperatura mitjana de 13,36 ºC. Pot semblar poc, però no només és 0,63 graus per sobre de la mitjana 1991-2020 -que ja té en compte l'impacte del canvi climàtic-, sinó fins a 1,59 més que l'era preindustrial. D'aquesta manera, s'encadenen 19 dels darrers 20 mesos per sobre del llindar marcat a l'Acord de París.\nEn el rànquing històric, s'ha situat en tercera posició, només per darrere del 2024 i del 2016, dos moments en què hi havia actius episodis del Niño. Actualment, el principal fenomen de variabilitat climàtica natural manté condicions d'una Niña feble. Malgrat això, les temperatures de la Terra estan lluny de normalitzar-se i, de fet, aquest març ha començat amb anomalies d'uns 1,7 ºC respecte als preindustrials.\n“El febrer de 2025 continua la ratxa de temperatures rècord observades durant els últims dos anys. Una de les conseqüències d'un món més càlid és la fusió del gel marí i això ha empès al mínim de cobertura de gel marí als dos pols”, assegura Samantha Burgess, responsable estratègica per al clima del Centre Europeu de Prediccions a Mitjà Termini (ECMWF).\nValors extrems com el de gener de 2025 -1,75 graus per sobre l'època preindustrial- es van produir malgrat estar actiu un episodi de la Niña. Això sí, segons l'última actualització de l'Organització Meteorològica Mundial (OMM) es tracta d'un fenomen feble i probablement de curta durada.\nVa començar el desembre del 2024 i, actualment, hi ha un 60% d'opcions que les condicions tornin a ser neutrals entre el març i el maig augmentant fins al 70% per a l'abril-juny de 2025.\nUn episodi de la Niña suposa un refredament a l'oceà Pacífic equatorial. Només si és intens, es pot notar inicialment a la resta d'oceans i, posteriorment, també al conjunt de l'atmosfera.",

    "text": "Saudi Arabia is prioritising peace and prosperity in its efforts to lead the Middle East towards stability and security amid ongoing geopolitical volatility in the region, Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud has said.\nThe Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the US told the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2024: “The kingdom has not put normalisation at the heart of its policy. It has put peace and prosperity at the heart of its policy.”\nPrincess Reema said in a session on ‘Saudi Arabia: The Course Ahead’: “Saudi Arabia’s focus is on the Palestinian people who deserve a state, sovereignty, and a pathway that is irrevocable. That is how we get security. We carry peace, we carry prosperity, we carry safety, and we deliver it through the Palestinian statehood.”\nAddressing climate change scientifically\nIn the same session, Adel A Aljubeir, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Member of the Council of Ministers and Envoy for Climate, spoke of the need to address climate change scientifically, decoupled from emotions and hypocrisy.\n“The world’s appetite for energy is unlimited. The additional increase of energy supplies has to come from non-oil resources,” Aljubeir said, noting: “We are saying we have a problem, and the problem has to do with climate change. And we need to tackle this problem in a serious, scientific manner. We need to deal with it without emotions, we need to deal with it without trying to score political points.”\nMohammed Aljadaan, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Finance, emphasised that the kingdom is determined to double down on what it is doing on its economy because the region and the world need a strong Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi non-oil GDP growing\nAljadaan highlighted that the kingdom’s non-oil GDP is growing, unemployment is at the lowest level, and women's participation in the workforce has already surpassed the target set under the Saudi Vision 2030.\nIn an earlier session on ‘Mena’s Economic Dilemma: Reforms Amid Uncertainty’, Faisal F Alibrahim, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Economy and Planning, described the resilient nature of the region. He said the Middle East “always comes out of challenges as a better version of itself” adding that it has an opportunity to “co-author the future of the global economy”.\nAlibrahim touched on national transformations, highlighting the importance of delivering “consistently with a boldness and a view to collaborate with the world. Vision 2030 is an evolution, a transformation that is taking us to where we want to be as an economy and society,” he said.\nIn the morning, a session on ‘Ocean Regeneration Through Collaborative Innovation’ explored approaches and solutions to environmental challenges.\nCopyright 2022 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
