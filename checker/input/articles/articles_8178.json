    "text": "“All things came into being through him, and without him, not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.”\nOn this Christmas Day, Christians across the nation and around the world celebrate the arrival of the baby Jesus in the most humble circumstances possible. The “light of all people” was born in a barn and laid in a feeding trough in as plain and unpretentious an event as any in history. There could be no lies or deception in such a place — no covering up the stink of animals or the chill of the night in the Judean Mountains. There was only the plain truth.\nJesus would later state that he himself was “the Truth” and also that “the Truth will set you free.” The light shining in the darkness — “the true light, which enlightens everyone,” as St. John put it — is something the world needs because the belief in Christ is also a belief many non-Christians share: that ultimately truth will prevail.\nTruth often hurts one reason so many reject it, even in Jesus’s time and even to his face. But the truth can also heal. Usually, healing cannot take place without it.\nStay up to speed:\nSign up for daily opinion in your inbox Monday-Friday\nToday, the nation finds itself in some very truth-challenged times. Materialist ideologies have acquired positions of power and influence and, in some cases, strayed about as far as one can get from the truth.\nIn the name of anti-racism, they have embraced racism wholeheartedly and attempted to indoctrinate children that they live in a supposedly irredeemable country where salvation comes from being born into the right victim class. They now seek to judge people solely by the color of their skin, in direct contravention of that famous Christian minister’s hopes that everyone would be judged by the content of their character.\nIn the name of climate alarmism, they now seek to lower living standards for the world’s poorest. We see corporations tolerating theft from their stores, passing the costs along to those who work hard and obey the law.\nA litany of time-tested values and beliefs — based on humanity's endless search for truth — are under attack. Jesus predicted this more than 2,000 years ago. Fear not, as the truth prevails.\nJesus, born of a woman and believed by Christians to be the true God and true man, has always been something of a villain to those actively running from or covering up the truth. He has to be that — this cannot come as a surprise, not to anyone who has read his words.\n“In this world, you will have trouble,” Jesus said as the time of his execution approached. “But take heart! I have overcome the world.”\nIndeed, how could the light shine in the darkness if there were not so much darkness in which to shine?\nColorado Springs Gazette Editorial Board",

    "title": "Endometriosis Pain Linked to Immune Cell Interaction: Study Insights",
    "text": "The pain of endometriosis is caused by an interaction between pain nerves and immune cells. This interaction also determines the size of the affected areas. That shows a study in mice and with tissue from eight patients which was published on Wednesday in the scientific journal Science translational medicine .\nEndometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Tissue that resembles the mucous membrane (the endometrium) that lines the uterus grows outside the uterus in this disease; for example around the ovaries or intestines. The mucosal tissue grows and shrinks during the menstrual cycle. The broken down mucous membrane and blood drain from the uterus every month. But this is not possible from other places in the abdominal cavity. This leads to chronic inflammation, adhesions and severe pain.\nSurgical removal The disease affects at least 1 in 10 women and also trans men, and is often unrecognized. Treatment consists of painkillers or hormones such as the contraceptive pill, which suppress the monthly cycle. Sometimes a surgeon can surgically remove the endometriosis spots.\nThe researchers looked at samples of endometriosis tissue from eight patients and studied lab mice into which they had injected uterine tissue into the abdominal cavity, a model for endometriosis. They discovered that endometriosis tissue contains the small protein CGRP. That molecule plays a role in pain. Pain-registering nerves, many of which are found in endometriosis tissue, also release it. It then binds to certain immune cells called macrophages, whose job is to clean up broken tissue. But because CGRP binds to those cells, these immune cells change in such a way that the endometriosis spots actually grow. The interaction therefore worsens the pain.\nIn the mice with endometriosis, the researchers tested four CGRP drugs approved in the US for the treatment of migraines (fremanezumab, galcanezumab, rimegepant and ubrogepant). All four reduced the mice’s sensitivity to pain, and in the animals given ubrogepant, the patches of endometriosis shrank.\nA microscopic image of endometriosis tissue in which nerve fibers (green) influence the activity of immune cells (macrophages, red) that must clear damaged cells. Photo Victor Fattori and Michael Rodgers\nReimbursed under certain conditions The first three migraine medications are also registered in Europe, and for chronic migraine, some CGRP inhibitors are reimbursed under certain conditions.\nGood research, says Ellen Klinkert, gynecologist and head of the endometriosis center at the UMC Groningen. “We still know little about how endometriosis develops and what causes the pain, this study sheds light on that.”\nWhether CGRP inhibitors will be a good option for patients with endometriosis remains to be seen. “Patients must use it for a long time to combat endometriosis; women suffer from it from the age of 12 to the age of 50. It must be carefully investigated whether such chronic use of these substances is safe. An advantage is that such a study can be set up more quickly with these existing resources than if it were new resources.”\nCorrection (November 7, 2024): An earlier version of this article stated that migraine patients only take CGRP inhibitors when an attack is approaching. That is not correct, they are also used chronically. It also stated that the resources are not reimbursed in the Netherlands. That is incorrect, for chronic migraine some CGRP inhibitors are reimbursed under certain conditions in the Netherlands. That has been adjusted above.\nAlso read\n‘Doctors keep saying: menstrual pain? Just get used to it’ Share Email the editor\nAh, endometriosis! The condition that turns the monthly gift of menstruation into an uninvited horror show. It’s the classic case of your body playing a game of “This isn’t what I ordered!” with all the worst side effects. Now, I don’t mean to make light of chronic pain—Lord knows that’s no laughing matter—but if we can’t laugh at the absurdity of it all, are we even living? Let’s dive into this fascinating article while we try to keep our gallows humor intact.\nSo, researchers have uncovered that the pain associated with endometriosis isn’t just some whimsical prank your body pulls. No, it’s a full-on scientific spectacle! It’s like a poorly cast play where pain nerves and immune cells dance a tango of torment. Honestly, you couldn’t make this up. These little drama queens, immune cells, take center stage and contribute to both the size of the affected areas and the lovely pain that comes along with it. And here we were thinking we only had to deal with emotional drama! The article cites a study in mice—because if there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that scientists are always going to test stuff on mice first. Sorry, little guys!\nSurgical Removal Let’s talk numbers—1 in 10 women and trans men get to enjoy the gift of endometriosis. Amazing, right? It’s like the worst club where the initiation rite involves chronic pain and emotional suffering. Treatment usually consists of a delightful cocktail of painkillers and hormones that do their best impressions of actual relief, but sometimes, if a miracle occurs, surgeons can swoop in like knights and remove those pesky endometriosis spots.\nResearchers have found something interesting in endometriosis tissue from patients: a small protein called CGRP. Sounds fancy, doesn’t it? This molecule is basically the secret sauce that amplifies pain, binding to immune cells whose main job should be to clean up that broken tissue. But of course, just like a bad houseguest who keeps rearranging your furniture, CGRP makes these immune cells turn on the spots, which sounds like an extreme version of ‘make it bigger!’ Who knew our bodies were shopping for pain like teenagers on a weekend spree?\nNow, here comes the fun part. In tests with mice—who are, let’s be honest, the real MVPs of medical research—the researchers tried out four CGRP drugs that are typically prescribed for migraines. Spoiler alert: these drugs did wonders for the little critters. All four of them had a positive impact, with one drug, ubrogepant, even shrinking those endometriosis patches. Not bad for a drug that was probably meant to keep your head from hurting, eh?\nReimbursed Under Certain Conditions Unfortunately, as our gynecologist friend Ellen Klinkert points out, we still don’t know enough about how endometriosis develops. It’s like trying to figure out why your mate keeps texting their ex—they just don’t know when to let go! However, the potential for CGRP inhibitors offers a glimmer of hope, although it raises questions about long-term use. If women typically suffer from this condition from about the age of 12 to 50, can we really safely medicate them? Great! Now we’re in the delightful territory of ‘let’s weigh the risks and benefits’ while also trying to maintain our sanity.\nAnd let’s not even get started on the corrections at the end of the article. Because if there’s one thing that’s always guaranteed in medical articles, it’s that someone will misinterpret something somewhere. A lesson to all of us: don’t trust everything you read on the internet—especially when it comes to your health!\nBut let’s wrap this up. Endometriosis is a multifaceted beast that affects millions with a combination of irritation, pain, and frustration. Research is ongoing, and while a humor-laden commentary can lighten the mood, awareness and empathy are key. At the end of the day, let’s hope this research will lead to a brighter future filled with actual solutions, not just more questions. And to all those out there facing the battle of endometriosis: you’re not alone, and science is—hopefully—on your side.\n**Interview⁤ with Dr. Ellen Klinkert on the Recent​ Advances in Endometriosis Research**\n**Host:** Welcome to our segment today! We have the pleasure of speaking with ‌Dr. Ellen‌ Klinkert, a gynecologist ‌and‌ head of the endometriosis center​ at UMC Groningen. She’s here to discuss a ​groundbreaking study on endometriosis and‍ the role of CGRP ⁤neuropeptides in managing pain. Dr. Klinkert, ‍thank you for ⁢joining us!\n**Dr. ⁣Klinkert:** Thank you for having‌ me! It’s a pleasure to discuss this important topic.\n**Host:** Let’s dive right in. The recent study published in *Science Translational Medicine*​ highlights the interplay‍ of pain⁢ nerves and immune cells⁣ in endometriosis. Can you explain why this finding is significant?\n**Dr. Klinkert:**⁣ Absolutely! Understanding the interaction between pain nerves and immune cells is ⁤crucial as ‌it directly impacts the experience⁣ of pain and the⁤ severity of endometriosis. The study shows that the small protein CGRP ‌plays a ⁤pivotal role in amplifying pain and actually‌ contributes to the growth of ⁢endometrial-like tissue outside ⁢the uterus. This is important⁣ because ​it sheds light on the biological mechanisms behind the chronic pain many ‍patients experience.\n**Host:** That’s fascinating! So, how does CGRP affect immune​ cells in the context of endometriosis?\n**Dr. Klinkert:** CGRP binds to⁢ immune cells called macrophages, which are supposed to help ⁢clean⁣ up damaged tissue. However, instead of resolving inflammation, CGRP alters their function, leading⁣ to an increase in the size of the endometriosis lesions. This ​ultimately exacerbates the pain, creating a vicious cycle ​that’s difficult for patients to break⁤ free from.\n**Host:** It sounds like a complex relationship! The‌ study also tested ‍CGRP drugs typically used for migraines.⁢ How effective were these treatments in ​the mouse models?\n**Dr. Klinkert:** The results were ‌promising. All four CGRP inhibitors tested reduced sensitivity to pain ⁤in the mice. Interestingly, one of the drugs,​ ubrogepant, not only alleviated pain but also caused ⁤a reduction in the size of​ endometriosis lesions. While these findings are exciting, we need​ to proceed with⁣ caution ⁢and⁢ further investigate the long-term ​safety and ⁣efficacy of these treatments in humans.\n**Host:** Given ⁢that endometriosis impacts around 1 in ‌10 women and‌ trans men, could CGRP inhibitors offer ⁣a new avenue for⁢ treatment?\n**Dr. Klinkert:** Potentially,⁢ yes. ‍If further studies confirm their ‌safety and effectiveness, CGRP inhibitors could provide ​an additional option for patients⁣ who currently have limited relief from⁣ traditional pain‍ management strategies. However, chronic​ use must be carefully examined, as endometriosis ​can persist⁣ over decades.\n**Host:** That’s a crucial point. With many patients suffering⁣ in silence ⁢for years, what message would you like to convey to ‌those ⁢affected by endometriosis?\n**Dr. Klinkert:** It’s vital for patients to advocate for themselves and seek medical ⁣help if they experience symptoms of​ endometriosis. ‌Education‍ on the condition is key, as is ongoing research to uncover the‍ best treatment methods.‌ We’re improving ‍our understanding, but there is‌ still much to learn.\n**Host:** Thank you so much,​ Dr. ‍Klinkert, for sharing your insights on this important⁣ issue. We ⁤hope to see‌ more advancements in the research ‌for effective treatments‌ for those‍ suffering⁣ from endometriosis.\n**Dr. Klinkert:** Thank you for having me! Let’s continue to raise awareness‌ and support research in⁣ this area.\n**Host:** ⁤Absolutely! Stay ⁤tuned for more discussions on health and wellness.",

    "text": "KU’s “Gateway District Project” brings changes to historic football staduim WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Starting in August 2025, fewer Jayhawk football fans will be able to watch the team play on their home field. Phase one of the “Gateway District Project,” which involves rebuilding the west side of David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium and adding a conference center, will decrease the number of available seats. The project, which started in December 2023, will cost $448 million and decrease the stadium’s capacity from 47,233 to approximately 40,000. [In an interview with](https://www2.kusports.com/weblogs/2024/apr/17/seating-at-kus-revamped-football-stadium-to-shrink-by-a-few-thousand-seats-other-updates-on-gateway-project/) [KUsports.com](http://kusports.com/), KU’s Athletic Director, Travis Goff, says the decrease in seating is actually a positive thing. He says all the bleacher seats on the west side will be replaced by chair-back seats, increasing comfort and offering better views for fans. Goff believes KU will find many uses besides football for the stadium and the connected conference center. The conference center will feature a large, wide-open room that could accommodate banquet-style seating for 1,000 people. KU says future phases of the project will focus on the south and east portions of the stadium, along with the entertainment, dining, and retail aspects of the Gateway District. During these phases, the stadium may see an increase in the number of seats available. Next season’s home football games will occur at Arrowhead Stadium and Children’s Mercy Park in Kansas City. Recognized as the first stadium built on a college campus west of the Mississippi River, David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium at Kansas University is the seventh oldest collegiate stadium in the nation. It opened in 1922 with a capacity of 22,000. Copyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved. To report a correction or typo, please email news@kwch.com",

Trump’s Major Disaster Declaration for recent catastrophic flooding that began impacting the state last week. Five counties – Burnet, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson – are requested to be eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency Individual Assistance programs, and four counties – Kendall, Kimble, Menard, and San Saba – are requested to be eligible for FEMA’s Public Assistance Program.\n\"The State of Texas continues to stand with those impacted by the devastating flooding across the state,\" said Governor Abbott. \"Today, I directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to request additional counties be added to the Presidential Disaster Declaration as they work to heal and recover. I thank President Trump and his Administration for their swift and continued support. Texas will continue to deploy all available resources and support to help those impacted until the job is done.\"",
