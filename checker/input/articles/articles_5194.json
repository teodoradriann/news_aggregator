    "text": "The United Kingdom is hitting the brakes on trade talks with Canada after Ottawa decided to not extend two temporary measures put in place after Brexit.\nLondon announced the pause in negotiations today, less than a month before the next round of talks towards a permanent trade deal was expected to take place.\nA special quota for U.K. cheese imports, which offered the same low-tariff access to the Canadian market as the European Union has, expired at the end of last month.\nCanada has also decided not to extend country-of-origin rules set to expire at the end of March, which will likely drive up the price of U.K. goods such as luxury cars.\nTrade Minister Mary Ng's office says the move stems from British \"unwillingness\" to offer something in return, such as budging on a dispute over Canadian meat.\nBoth countries insist they want a fair deal for each other's businesses, farmers and workers.\n\"We reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made,\" reads a statement from the British government.\n\"We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nShanti Cosentino, a spokeswoman for Ng, said Canada is \"disappointed\" in the move.\n\"Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations,\" she said.\n\"The U.K. is a long-standing trading partner, and I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is (a) win-win for Canada and for the U.K.\"\nCanada's cattle sector has been lobbying against a deal with the U.K. over a long-standing dispute on hormone-treated beef and pork.\nThe U.K. has held back on importing meats treated with certain hormones that are widely used by Canadian ranchers, who argue the Brits' concern isn’t grounded in science.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.\nDylan Robertson, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Norfolk Botanical Garden Employees Vote to Join IAM Union\nAugust 7, 2025\nWorkers at Norfolk Botanical Garden have voted in favor of union representation by IAM Union. In a July 23 election, employees cast their ballots by a margin of 43-23, joining IAM Local 10 after months of organizing efforts by IAM Southern Assistant Organizing Coordinator Bridget Fitzgerald.\nThe campaign was sparked by an organizing win for the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden in November 2024. After witnessing Lewis Ginter employees’ success in organizing, Norfolk workers reached out to Fitzgerald in early 2025 and started collecting union election authorization cards in May.\n“The Lewis Ginter drive garnered a lot of attention,” said Fitzgerald. “They had a social media presence that the Norfolk Botanical Garden workers followed and reached out to talk to those workers, had a couple different conversations about their issues and what made them decide to unionize. Norfolk workers decided that they wanted to travel that same path.”\nThe IAM Union has been strategically working to organize in the non-profit sector to empower workers who give so much, often to benefit the public, like with the Norfolk Botanical Garden.\nWorkers of the Botanical Garden felt collective bargaining would help to raise wages, which are below a reasonable standard of living in the area, aid in transparency and decision-making, and give workers a collective voice in operations and planning.\n“Most of them, the first thing they mention is needing better pay, but then they say that what they really want is a voice,” said Fitzgerald. “The lack of transparency, the inconsistency, and no reliable policy on inclement weather – for this type of work that’s unacceptable.”\nTheir campaign drew overwhelming public backing, including nearly 450 signers on a community petition and vocal support from State Sen. Angelia Williams Graves and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott.\nDespite opposition by the company hiring an anti‑union consultant, the garden workers and now new union members held firm.\n“Workers countered every lie and piece of misinformation,” said Fitzgerald. “Nothing the employer did with anti‑union persuasion was going to change their mind.”\nThe newly certified unit is now preparing for the first contract negotiations, working with IAM Local 10 and District 2020 Directing Business Representative Charles Mann, who will guide the group in distributing a bargaining survey, electing a negotiating committee, and drafting proposals before the formal bargaining sessions begin.\nNorfolk IAM members aim to negotiate improvements in wages, a guaranteed inclement‑weather policy, clear attendance practices, and the ability to contribute meaningfully to the Garden’s future with sustainable working conditions that reflect their professional dedication.\n“We are empowering workers in every industry,” said IAM Organizing Assistant Director Juan Eldridge. “Nonprofit workers are workers nonetheless. They give everything to their job, they are professionals and experts in what they do, and they need to be valued for that expertise and dedication.”\nWhile nonprofit employers may operate with thinner margins, the Nolfolk union workers intend to empower their workplace through collective bargaining. They aren’t seeking to break the garden, they simply want fair dignity and respect on the job.\n“They love the work,” said Fitzgerald. “They want to make it a career, not just a job for a few years.”",

    "text": "Cockroaches. Just the thought of living with cockroaches gives most people the jeepers. But it seems that residents in Houston have to live with them.\nPest Gnome, a company that connects people with pest exterminators, recently ranked the most roach-infested cities in the U.S. using data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study looked at “The 25 Roachiest Cities in America.”\nThe city that earned the highest average score was ranked as No. 1, or the “Roachiest,” and the lowest average score as No. 25, or “Least Roachy.”\nAt the top of the list is Houston,\nTexas. A staggering 37 percent of homes showed signs of roaches in the past 12 months. Pest Gnome attributes this high prevalence to Houston’s hot and humid climate, which provides ideal conditions for roach infestations, CW39 reported.\nAccording to Pest Gnome, the two most common types of cockroaches in Houston are the big, brown, and flying American cockroach (aka palmetto bug) and the kitchen, pantry, and sink-dwelling German cockroach.\nAnother Texas city came in second. San Antonio claimed the second position on the list, with approximately 28 percent of homes displaying signs of roaches in the past year. Rounding out the top five were Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nDiscover How Affordable Peace of Mind Can Be: Get Your Life Insurance Quote Today!\n“All of these cities have sun and heat in summer, which roaches love, and winters here just don’t get that cold to kill them off,” Pest Gnome said,\nKSAT reported.\nAt the bottom, at no. 25, was Seattle, WA.\nCockroaches can also pose a health risk to humans.\n“Cockroaches are known to transfer disease pathogens, such as the various bacteria that produce ‘food poisoning’ in humans, by contaminating food, food preparation surfaces, dishes and eating utensils,” the Illinois Department of Public Health stated on its\n website.\nPhoto by Erik Karits, https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cockroach-on-a-rock-11032990/We Love Houston photo, Flickr, by Kristina D.C.

    "title": "Amdocs layoffs mark a turning point in \"making AI an integral part of DNA\"",
    "text": "Amdocs layoffs mark a turning point in “making AI an integral part of DNA”\nAs the company launches its GenAI & Data division, hundreds of employees in Israel and abroad face job cuts, underscoring how artificial intelligence is reshaping work at one of the world’s largest telecom software firms.\nFor years, workforce cuts at Amdocs have been framed as “fine tuning”, a quiet trimming of underperformers or a recalibration to protect margins. This time, the company is openly confronting a very different catalyst, the accelerating adoption of generative artificial intelligence.\nOn Monday,\nAmdocs unveiled its new GenAI & Data division, a group two years in the making, tasked with integrating AI into every corner of the company. The announcement came alongside preparations for a fresh round of layoffs expected to affect hundreds of employees in Israel and abroad.Until recently, companies avoided saying the quiet part out loud, that AI was replacing people. “We are laying off employees because GenAI is changing our world” is a statement that would have sounded like science fiction in boardrooms only a few years ago. But as Microsoft’s CEO has acknowledged, even while shedding 9,000 workers during peak profitability, the once-sacred assumption that “successful companies always hire more people” no longer holds.\nOther tech firms have followed similar trajectories. Israeli transcription firm Verbit let go of staff after clients switched to cheaper AI translation tools. Marketing unicorn Yotpo cut more than 200 jobs, selling off operations made irrelevant by machine learning advances.\nFor Amdocs, the exact number of forthcoming cuts remains undisclosed. The company’s reticence underscores an uncomfortable truth, it knows AI will reshape its workforce but can’t yet predict the full scale.\nThe new division will be led by Ilan Sade, Senior Vice President, who framed the launch as a strategic turning point: “We established the new division with the strategic intention of making artificial intelligence an integral part of Amdocs’ DNA… Our journey began two years ago, and now we are deepening our commitment and positioning ourselves as global market leaders in the field.”\nEarlier this year, Inbar Mark, Head of HR Israel at Amdocs,\ntold CTech: “Our focus has been on leveraging AI as a powerful tool to augment and empower our workforce. We view AI tools not as a replacement for human talent, but as a powerful enabler that enhances our capabilities across the board.”While the GenAI & Data unit will consolidate Amdocs’ product, engineering, strategy, and go-to-market teams, it also signals an era where automation could shrink or entirely replace traditional roles. As the company has demonstrated in Macedonia and South Africa, delivering cloud-based telecom solutions to millions, AI is no longer an add-on to existing services, but a core operational driver.\nAmdocs is no stranger to restructuring. In 2023, it eliminated 2,700 roles in two rounds, with 12% of Israeli staff affected. In 2024 alone, a further 1,500 positions were shed. The latest reduction would add to that tally, leaving many to question how far, and how fast, AI adoption will reshape the company’s 29,000-strong workforce.\nFor employees, the question is no longer whether AI will change their jobs, but whether their jobs will survive at all. For Amdocs, the gamble is whether these technological gains will outpace the disruption they cause.",
