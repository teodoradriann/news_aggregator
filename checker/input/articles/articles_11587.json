    "title": "Prescription Weight-loss Medicines",
    "text": "Prescription weight loss medicines can help people with obesity lose weight. They are usually prescribed by a doctor when diet and exercise alone are not working. Each of these medicines works differently. People who use these medicines may not feel as hungry. Or they may feel full after eating only a small amount of food. Another type of weight-loss medicine makes it harder for your body to absorb fat. Prescription weight loss drugs can be helpful when used in combination with a low-calorie diet and regular physical activity.\nWho uses prescription weight loss medicines?\nPrescription weight-loss medicines are only for people who have obesity. Most of these medicines are designed for people who weigh 20% or more above what is ideal for their height and body type. Or they are used with people who have a high body mass index (BMI). The BMI is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. Your doctor may prescribe you medicine to treat your obesity if you have:\n- A BMI of 30 or greater.\n- A BMI of 27 or more and you have a disease or condition that may be related to your weight (this could include diabetes or high blood pressure).\nYour doctor can tell you if prescription weight-loss medicines might be helpful for you.\nPath to improved health\nPrescription weight-loss medicines generally work in 2 ways. Most work in your body to make you less hungry or feel full faster. One FDA-approved medicine works in your digestive tract. It blocks the amount of fat your body can absorb. Some medicines are approved only for a short period of time, usually no more than 12 weeks. Others can be used long-term.\nThe following are medicines currently approved by the FDA for weight loss. Also included is information on how they work, common side effects, and warnings for each.\nOrlistat\n- Brand name: Xenical\n- How it works: It reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs.\n- Side effects: diarrhea, gas, uncontrollable bowel movements, leakage of oily stool\n- Warnings: It can reduce the amount of certain vitamins that your body can absorb You should take a multivitamin pill every day.\nOrlistat is also available in a lower dose without a prescription. That over-the-counter medicine is called Alli. Orlistat is the only medicine of its kind to be approved in the U.S.\nThe following medicines make you feel less hungry or full faster. They share common side effects, including constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, and nausea. Additional side effects are listed for each medicine.\nNaltrexone-bupropion\n- Brand name: Contrave\n- How it works: It makes you less hungry or fuller faster.\n- Side effects: headache, increased blood pressure and heart rate, insomnia, liver damage, vomiting\n- Warnings: Don’t use if you have untreated high blood pressure, seizures, or a history of anorexia or bulimia. Don’t use if you are dependent on opioid pain medicines or are withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. Don’t use if you are already taking bupropion (brand names Wellbutrin, Zyban). This medicine could increase suicidal thoughts or actions.\nPhentermine-topiramate\n- Brand name: Qysmia\n- How it works: It decreases appetite and makes you feel full sooner\n- Side effects: taste changes (especially carbonated beverages), tingling of hands and feet, trouble sleeping\n- Warnings: Tell your doctor if you have had a heart attack, stroke, abnormal heart rhythm, kidney disease, or mood disorder. Do not take if you have hyperthyroidism or glaucoma. This medicine could cause birth defects. Do not use if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.\nLiraglutide\n- Brand name: Saxenda\n- How it works: It makes you feel less hungry or full sooner\n- Side effects: abdominal pain, headache, increased pulse\n- Warnings: It is available only by injection. Could increase the chance of developing pancreatitis.\nSemiglutide\n- Brand name: Wegovy and Ozempic\n- How it works: It regulates your appetite to make you feel less hungry\n- Side effects: nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, headache\n- Warnings: It is an injection. Using this medicine could increase risk for thyroid tumors.\nThere are other medicines that can reduce your desire to eat. These include:\n- Phentermine\n- Benzphetamine\n- Diethylpropion\n- Phendimetrazine\nThese medicines are only FDA-approved to be used short-term, up to 12 weeks. They may only provide temporary weight loss. They have some side effects, too. These include:\n- Difficulty sleeping\n- Feeling nervous or restless\n- Headache\n- Raised blood pressure or pulse\nYou should not use these medicines if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma. You should tell your doctor if you have anxiety or mood disorders before using these medicines.\nIn rare cases, some weight-loss medicines can cause serious liver injury. Call your doctor right away if you notice symptoms of liver injury, including:\n- Itching skin\n- Yellow eyes or skin\n- Urine that is brown or dark-colored\n- Pale-colored stool\n- Loss of appetite\n- Abdominal pain\nSome weight-loss supplements containing ephedra, ephedrine, or caffeine are available without a prescription (over the counter). It is not known whether these medicines are safe. Such supplements have been linked to reports of heart attack, seizure, stroke, and death. It is important to talk to your doctor if you are taking or are considering taking an over-the-counter weight-loss supplement.\nThings to consider\nHow can I avoid gaining weight back when I stop using the medicine?\nThere is no easy cure for being overweight. Prescription weight-loss medicines can help you get off to a good start. But once you stop taking them, the weight you lost may come back. To keep the weight off, you must eat a healthy diet and be physically active on a regular basis. You must continue these healthy habits even after you stop taking the medicine. Remember that losing weight and keeping it off is a lifelong effort.\nHow can I lose weight without taking a weight-loss medicine?\nIf you decide weight-loss medicines aren’t right for you, you can still meet your weight-loss goals. It’s important to develop healthy eating habits. But don’t expect to change everything overnight. Start by training yourself to eat without doing anything else at the same time. For example, don’t eat while you watch TV. Focus on what you’re eating. Try to eat slowly.\nNext, change what and how much you eat. Your doctor can help you create a low-calorie or low-carb diet plan that will help you lose weight. They can offer tips for healthy snacking and portion control.\nIt is also important to be physically active. Regardless of your weight loss goal, the minimum recommended exercise for improving health is 30 minutes 5 times a week (for a total of 150 minutes per week). Regular exercise helps you burn calories faster, even when you are sitting still. Exercise also helps you burn fat and build muscle.\nAerobic exercise raises your heart rate and helps you burn calories. Examples of aerobic exercises include swimming, brisk walking, jogging, and bicycling. Anaerobic exercise, such as weight training, is also good because it adds muscle mass to your body. Muscle burns calories faster than fat.\nBe sure to check with your family doctor before you begin an exercise program. They can help you create an exercise plan that will help you meet your goals.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\n- What is my BMI?\n- Do I meet the qualifications for weight-loss medicines?\n- Which medicine is the right one for me?\n- What are the side effects?\n- Are the benefits of taking the medicine worth the risks and side effects?\n- Will my insurance cover it?\n- How long will I take it?\n- Will I gain weight when I stop taking it?\n- What can I do to prevent gaining weight?\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Healthy Weight, Nutrition, and Physical Activity\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Prescription Medications to Treat Overweight and Obesity\nCopyright © American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "text": "ALMOND Vosotros performed another notable game for TNT in the PBA 49th Season Philippine Cup finals, but this time, it resulted to a win.\nVosotros stepped up with the Tropang 5G going deep into their arsenal with 11 points, going 4-of-8 from the field in their 86-78 victory against San Miguel to stay alive in their title bid and Grand Slam search.\nREAD: TNT stands defiant, mauls SMB to extend PBA Finals to a Game Six\nIn TNT's Game 3 loss to the Beermen, the veteran gunner had 14 points while making 4-of-5 from threes.\nThis time, Vosotros made a significant impact in TNT's pullaway from SMB.\nAnd the former Triple Giga top gun’s efforts came at an opportune time, with his side losing another guard in Simon Enciso due to a fractured orbital bone back in Game 3.\n“Just the next man up,” coach Chot Reyes said about his fourth point guard now, after also already being without Jayson Castro and Rey Nambatac.\n“We’ve lost our top three point guards – our starting point guards. We’ve lost Jayson, Rey, and now Simon. Just next man up.”\nThe Tropang 5G actually expected such performance from Vosotros, who may be at the end of their rotation, but is armed with experience in different levels of basketball, being a two-time gold medalist in the Southeast Asian Games, a silver medalist in SEA Games 3x3, and a many-time local and international campaigner in the 3x3 circuit while playing for TNT Triple Giga.\n“We are fortunate that we were able to sign him late in the elimination round, so that gives us another option at this point,” said Reyes. “We all know his game. He is no stranger to big games. He’s had a lot of big games in his career both internationally and 3x3. He is just ready to deliver.”\nAlmond all good\nBeing ready is exactly what Vosotros did, as he took advantage of San Miguel’s defense focusing on TNT’s top weapons such as RR Pogoy.\n“Nag-umpisa ‘yan sa pasa ni Roger, kapag umaatake ‘yung ibang guards, talagang may nalilibre. Kailangan lang namin ng more patience sa offense,” said Vosotros.\n“’Yun naman lagi kong sinasabi, lagi ako nandito, wino-work out ko naman siya sa practice. Being ready lang talaga.”\nREAD: Vosotros makes compelling case to stay with TNT after contract ends next week\nWith Vosotros’ contributions, the Tropang 5G injected life into their title quest, slicing their margin to San Miguel to 2-3.\n“Lagi naman kami sinasabihan ni coach na hangga’t may pag-asa talaga, laban lang kami lagi. Hangga’t may opportunity na makabalik sa series, ‘yun lang ang focus namin,” said the 35-year-old Vosotros.\nGet more of the latest sports news & updates on SPIN.ph",

    "title": "WhatsApp will renew reactions to messages: first clues from the latest beta for iOS – TuttoTech",
    "text": "WhatsApp ‘s New Beta Update: Emoji Me Up, Scotty! So, folks, it seems that WhatsApp is at it again! The WhatsApp team has rolled out a splendid new beta update for iOS via the TestFlight beta program, bringing the application to version 24.21.10.76 . What’s cooking in the WhatsApp kitchen this time? Well, it appears they’re stirring the pot to cook up some delicious innovations for message reactions. And let’s just say, if you’re one of those people who can’t live without your emojis, this news is about to make you grin wider than a Cheshire cat who just found a lifetime supply of cream!\nNew Reactions on the Horizon! Now, before we dive deeper into these juicy details, let’s remind ourselves that despite our intense love affair with WhatsApp, we’re still waiting for a proper app for the iPad. I mean, c’mon, WhatsApp! Some of us need a little more screen real estate to showcase our hysterical meme-sharing prowess! If you’re like me and prefer to chat while sitting in a stylish café, let’s hope they’re working on something fabulous. In the meantime, the iOS update promises to enhance a feature we had a delightful chat about back in the day — the reaction emojis to your messages. Oh, the anticipation!\nWhat’s the big news, you ask? Well, let me break it down for you like a discount DJ at a wedding. Currently, when you react to a message, you’re stuck with a static reaction bar featuring six fixed emojis and that old “+” button for all the others—like your inexperienced buddy who can only juggle two balls. Boring, right? But fear not! The WhatsApp team has been busy (probably fueled by caffeine and despair!) and is working on a fantastic new sliding reaction bar that will allow you to select your most recent emojis in a blink. Talk about instant gratification!\nImagine a world where you can respond to your mate’s dad joke with a perfectly poised poop emoji — no scrolling, no fuss, just emoji excellence at your fingertips! This delightful upgrade has already been spotted in the Android beta channel, so it’s only fair that iOS users get a taste of this emoji revolution, right?\nWhat’s Next for WhatsApp? Stay Tuned! But hold your horses; this feature is still in development! So, for now, we’re left hanging like a badly constructed punchline. But don’t worry! If you’re the impatient type (and let’s face it, who isn’t these days?), we’ve whipped up a handy guide on how to download WhatsApp Beta on iOS and Android so you can get the inside scoop before your friends!\nSo, whether you’re a “thumbs-up” kind of person or someone who expresses feelings via a dramatically exaggerated facepalm emoji, stay tuned! WhatsApp is working tirelessly — presumably not from a beach umbrella, but rather from their offices — to deliver what we need. So, keep your eyes peeled for updates, and for heaven’s sake, make sure to follow the news on WhatsApp, unless you want to be the last person in the world to find out about your brand new favorite thumb emoji!\nFor the latest gossipy updates and features, don’t forget to hop onto our official WhatsApp channel and keep your emoji game strong!\nIn the past few hours, the WhatsApp team has released a new one beta update for iOS via the TestFlight beta Program bringing the application to version 24.21.10.76 and anticipating the future introduction of an interesting innovation in the functioning of reactions to messages. The novelty in question is under development and will be introduced with a future update of the app, but this does not prevent us from discovering it in preview.\nBefore going into the merits of the news in question, we remind you that you can find all the latest news on the most famous messaging app in the world – such as, for example, the one relating to the customization of the themes of the various chats – in our pages dedicated to WhatsApp per Android and to WhatsApp for iOS and Desktop.\nWhatsApp working to improve reactions to messages If on the one hand there is still no trace of the dedicated app for iPad, on the other the WhatsApp team continues to work assiduously on the one for iOS and the latest update released for the beta branch of the service resumes a function we had talked about in unsuspecting times for the Android world: work is underway for renew reactions to messages by highlighting recent emoji .\nIn short, through this new operating mechanism, the WhatsApp team wants to ensure that, when reacting to a message, users have immediate access to the most frequently used emoji. Already spotted in the beta channel for Android, therefore, the novelty in question is also being developed for WhatsApp Beta for iOS, as can be seen from the sighting in the update 24.21.10.76. The following screenshot clearly highlights that, while at present the reaction bar includes six fixed predefined emojis (and the “+” button to choose from all the others), in the future the bar will become sliding and users will be able to select recent emoji more quickly . This should give greater comfort and flexibility to reactions.\nAs mentioned at the beginning, the novelty described is still in the development phase; We will update you as soon as it is made available. In case, however, you are eager to preview the new features offered through the beta program, we have created a guide on how to download WhatsApp Beta on iOS and Android.\nFinally, we remind you that to stay updated on all the news, you can also follow us on our official WhatsApp channel .",
