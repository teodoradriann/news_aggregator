    "title": "Electric Vehicles on the Verge of Price Parity with Traditional Cars, Says Goldman Sachs Amid Global Challenges",
    "text": "Advances in battery technology and reductions in the cost of critical battery metals are set to bring electric vehicles (EVs) to price parity with traditional gasoline-powered cars, according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs. The financial giant’s forecast is optimistic, predicting a nearly 50% drop in battery prices over the next few years. However, this outlook faces challenges, including concerns about oversupply, environmental impacts, and geopolitical tensions affecting the supply of rare-earth elements, particularly from China.\nRapid Advances in EV Battery Technology Goldman Sachs’ new research highlights the accelerating pace of technological innovation in EV battery production, which is expected to dramatically reduce costs in the near future. The report suggests that the global average price for EV batteries, which stood at $153 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2020, has already fallen to $149 in 2023. By the end of this year, the price is expected to drop further to $111 per kWh, with projections showing a significant reduction to just $80 by 2026.\nThese falling prices are a crucial factor in bringing the total cost of owning an electric vehicle in line with that of traditional gasoline cars. This shift toward parity is predicted to occur even before factoring in government subsidies designed to encourage EV adoption. In the US, this could mark a significant milestone, making electric vehicles a more accessible option for mainstream consumers.\nDrivers of Cost Reductions According to Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs’ Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research division, two key factors are contributing to the rapid decline in battery costs. The first is technological innovation, which has led to significant improvements in energy density. Current EV batteries boast up to 30% higher energy density compared to previous models, all while lowering the overall cost of production. Many of these innovations are already commercially available, and continued research and development in the field are expected to sustain this trend.\nThe second major factor driving down battery costs is the ongoing reduction in the prices of essential battery metals, such as lithium and cobalt. These metals account for around 60% of the total cost of producing an EV battery. Between 2020 and 2023, the industry experienced what Bhandari refers to as “green inflation,” with rising prices for materials across the board. However, recent price drops in these metals have contributed to a substantial portion of the forecasted cost reductions, with Goldman Sachs estimating that 40% of the savings will come from lower commodity prices.\nGeopolitical Risks and Market Disruptions Despite the optimistic forecast, the Goldman Sachs report does not fully address some of the critical challenges facing the EV battery market. One of the biggest concerns is the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, particularly surrounding the supply of rare-earth elements. China controls a significant portion of the global supply of these elements, which are essential for EV batteries and other technologies. In response to trade restrictions imposed by the US, China has started leveraging its dominance in the rare-earth market, which could disrupt the global supply chain and slow progress in battery production.\nAdditionally, environmental concerns surrounding the extraction and processing of battery metals, such as lithium, are also coming under increased scrutiny. While the EV market is seen as a cornerstone of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the environmental impact of mining these metals remains a contentious issue.\nOutlook for the EV Market Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs remains highly optimistic about the future of electric vehicles. The research highlights that lithium-based batteries will likely continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future, even as new technologies like solid-state batteries emerge as potential alternatives. Five companies currently control 80% of the global EV battery market, and their extensive R&D investments are expected to maintain their competitive edge while keeping barriers high for new entrants.\nLooking ahead, while the market faces hurdles such as oversupply and geopolitical risks, Goldman Sachs anticipates a resurgence in consumer demand by 2026, driving further growth in the EV sector. If battery prices continue to decline as predicted, the transition to electric vehicles could accelerate, making them a more viable option for drivers worldwide.",

    "text": "Shocking Study Reveals How Long You May Live After Being Diagnosed with Dementia\nA major study has revealed how long a person can expect to live after a dementia diagnosis. According to various factors that contribute to life expectancy after diagnosis, age and your postal address play a key part. Survival rates range between two and nine years on average, the study suggests. Read on to know the details.\nDementia is the leading cause of death across the world\nDementia is a devastating condition that often attacks people’s ability to think, learn, and remember. As it progresses, the cognitive decline damages the brain so much that it eventually affects areas that control vital functions like breathing and swallowing.\nHowever, it has always been little known as to how long you may live after your diagnosis. According to new research, it could be as little as two years. Scientists say the life expectancy time frame after being diagnosed with dementia is between two and nine years.\nAge plays an important role\nWhile there are various factors that play an important role in contributing to your life expectancy, age plays a major part in this.\nExperts led by academics from Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in the Netherl that average survival after diagnosis was strongly dependent on age as men who are diagnosed at 65 years could expect to survive for 5.7 years, while those diagnosed when they were 85 could expect 2.2 years.\nWomen diagnosed at 65 years could expect to live up to 8.9 years, while those at 85 years could expect 4.5 years. However, according to experts, women have a shorter survival after diagnosis compared with men because women tend to be diagnosed later in life.\nWhere you live is also important for longevity\nExperts said there are also differences over the continents, with those living in Asia expected to live for more than a year longer after their dementia diagnosis than those in Europe or the United States.\n\"About one-third of remaining life expectancy was lived in nursing homes, with more than half of people moving to a nursing home within five years after a dementia diagnosis,\" the authors wrote in the British Medical Journal.\nAccording to studies, someone in the world develops dementia every three seconds. There are over 55 million people worldwide living with dementia and it is estimated that the number will almost double every 20 years, reaching 78 million in 2030 and 139 million in 2050.\nDementia is the leading cause of death across the world. And since there is no cure, the numbers are only expected to rise.\nDoes memory loss mean dementia is starting?\nOne common misbelief about memory loss is that it always means you or a loved one has dementia. There are many causes of memory loss. Memory loss alone doesn’t necessarily confirm a diagnosis of dementia.\nIt’s also true that some memory changes are normal as a person ages (some neurons in your brain naturally die as we age). However, this type of memory loss is not functionally disabling - meaning it does not interfere with daily life.\nDementia interferes with your ability to function. Dementia isn’t forgetting where you left your keys. A person with dementia can have situations like forgetting what keys are used for. Dementia isn’t a normal part of ageing.\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[Health](https://www.timesnownews.com/health)and around the world.Ashima Sharda Mahindra author\nIs a prolific writer with a varied experience of over two decades of journalism under her belt.

    "text": "Dopo un’attesa che sembra infinita — ben otto anni, mica bruscolini — finalmente qualcosa inizia a muoversi davvero intorno a Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. La notizia che tutti stavamo aspettando arriva da un posto un po’ insolito, ma molto importante: il GRAC, l’ente di classificazione dei videogiochi in Corea del Sud. Quando un gioco passa di lì, di solito è un segnale forte che l’uscita è alle porte. È un po’ come vedere la lampadina accendersi prima che arrivi la festa: non hai ancora la data precisa, ma sai che manca poco.\nMetroid Prime 4: la valutazione coreana anticipa la data di uscita\nLa storia recente ci ha insegnato a leggere questi segnali. Prendi Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, per esempio: ha ricevuto la sua valutazione a febbraio, la data ufficiale è stata annunciata a marzo e a giugno eravamo già tutti lì, controller in mano. Quindi, seguendo questa logica, è lecito pensare che Nintendo stia per fare un annuncio simile, magari in un Nintendo Direct, alla Gamescom o al Tokyo Game Show. Insomma, non resta che incrociare le dita e sperare che la nuova avventura di Samus arrivi prima della fine del 2025 o all’inizio del 2026.\nQuesta certificazione arriva a smentire pure quei rumor che giravano poco fa, quelli che dicevano che il gioco sarebbe ancora lontano dal completamento. Un insider, Reece ‘KiwiTalks’ Reilly, aveva lasciato intendere che ci sarebbero stati problemi interni allo sviluppo, ma senza fornire dettagli chiari, e poi ha scelto di non approfondire, forse proprio perché Nintendo si stava preparando a qualcosa di grosso. Ora, con questo “via libera” del GRAC, sembra proprio che la situazione sia molto più avanti di quanto immaginassimo.\nC’è anche un dettaglio interessante: Metroid Prime 4 è stato sviluppato pensando sia alla Switch di prima generazione sia alla nuova Switch 2. Quindi chi ha ancora la vecchia console potrà goderselo, anche se solo sulla nuova versione si potrà apprezzare tutto il potenziale grafico, i 120 fps e i controlli “alla mouse” che promettono di rendere il gioco ancora più fluido e godibile. Insomma, dopo così tanto tempo, l’attesa sembra davvero quasi finita. Ora non ci resta che aspettare e prepararci a immergerci di nuovo nel mondo di Samus con la stessa emozione di sempre.",

    "title": "Il caldo non molla, oggi 10 città da bollino rosso. Ma sabato saranno 'solo' 7",
    "text": "(Adnkronos) - Inizio agosto di caldo rovente per l&#039;Italia, ma con la prospettiva di un primo weekend del mese che si preannuncia meno afoso. Secondo l&#039;ultimo aggiornamento del bollettino sulle ondate di calore del ministero della Salute, infatti, oggi venerdì 2 agosto, i capoluoghi con bollino rosso sono 10 - 2 meno di ieri - mentre per domani, sabato 3, le città con livello massimo di allerta scenderanno a 7. Contrassegnate dal bollino rosso sono oggi 10 delle 27 città monitorate dal ministero. Si tratta di Bologna, Bolzano, Brescia, Firenze, Frosinone, Latina, Perugia, Rieti, Roma e Viterbo. Bollino arancione, invece, per Bari e Campobasso. Domani, sabato 3 agosto, scenderanno quindi a 7 le città da bollino rosso (livello di rischio 3). L&#039;allerta resterà massima a Firenze, Frosinone, Latina, Perugia, Rieti, Roma e Viterbo, mentre la maggior parte degli altri capoluoghi sarà contrassegnata dal bollino giallo (rischio 1). Rischio 2 (bollino arancione) solo a Catania, con Napoli e Trieste a rischio 0 (bollino verde). Dopo la giornata infernale di ieri, secondo gli esperti de ILMeteo.it le temperature continueranno ad essere altissime anche oggi con Siracusa a 41°C, Catania e Foggia a 39°C e quasi tutto il Sud con le zone interne di pianura a 38°C; in Sardegna vivremo ancora la nuova normalità con 43-44°C nelle zone lontane dal mare. E anche i temporali saranno ancora prepotenti al Nord: si prevedono rovesci intensi specie sulle Alpi, ma in locale discesa verso le pianure adiacenti. La traiettoria di questa nuova passata temporalesca deve essere ben definita dai modelli. Quel che è certo è che anche il Centro vivrà i primi momenti temporaleschi dopo una calma piatta durata circa 10 giorni: nella notte e al primo mattino di sabato 3 agosto sono previsti infatti rovesci e colpi di vento sull’Alto Adriatico con coinvolgimento successivo di tutte le regioni centrali e di parte del Nord-Est più interno: in pratica ritroveremo dei rovesci a macchia di leopardo dalla costa romagnola fino al Lazio, a mitigare un’afa opprimente che attanaglia da giorni tutti questi settori. Dopo questi temporali il quadro termo-igrometrico (temperatura e umidità) sarà meno folle, ci sarà una leggera discesa dei picchi di caldo, seppur temporanea. Infatti, già da lunedì 5 agosto, una nuova fiammata nordafricana guadagnerà terreno verso tutta l’Italia. Il caldo di Caronte non è finito, ma attenzione ai forti temporali al Centro-Nord.",

    "title": "European Space Agency’s Hera Mission to Investigate Asteroid Deflection After DART Impact | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "The European Space Agency (ESA) is set to launch its Hera spacecraft on a mission to study the aftermath of NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), which successfully crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos in 2022. This event marked the first test of Earth’s planetary defense system, designed to deflect potentially dangerous asteroids. Hera’s mission will involve inspecting the asteroid to evaluate the damage caused by the DART impact and collecting important data on Dimorphos. DART’s Success in Deflecting an Asteroid The DART mission succeeded in altering the trajectory of Dimorphos, a pyramid-shaped asteroid located about 11 million kilometers from Earth. The impactor, roughly the size of a refrigerator, effectively shifted the asteroid from its original path, demonstrating that humanity can potentially protect itself from future asteroid threats. Why Hera’s Mission Is Critical Despite DART’s success, there are still many unanswered questions. Scientists are uncertain about the extent of the damage and what the asteroid's condition was before the impact. To resolve these issues, ESA is sending Hera on a “crime scene investigation” to better understand how Earth can defend itself against asteroids that might pose a danger in the future. Hera is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. However, a recent issue with SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission has raised concerns about a potential delay. ESA’s project manager, Ian Carnelli, mentioned that approval is still needed from the US Federal Aviation Administration, NASA, and SpaceX. The launch window is open until October 27. Once launched, Hera will fly past Mars next year and is expected to reach Dimorphos by December 2026. Over a six-month period, it will investigate the asteroid using 12 scientific instruments. Hera’s mission will also deploy two nanosatellites—Juventas, which will attempt to land on Dimorphos to measure its gravity, and Milani, which will study the asteroid’s composition and assess the effects of DART’s impact. The Threat of Asteroids While asteroid impacts are rare, they can cause significant destruction. An asteroid over a kilometer wide could trigger a global catastrophe, similar to the one that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, such events are extremely infrequent. Asteroids around 140 meters wide, like Dimorphos, could still cause severe damage, potentially destroying a large city. Most asteroids originate from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Almost all those larger than a kilometer wide have been identified, and none are expected to threaten Earth in the next century. However, only about 40 percent of the 140-meter-wide asteroids have been discovered. Patrick Michel, principal investigator for the Hera mission, highlighted that humanity now has the tools to defend itself from asteroid impacts. Dimorphos, a small moonlet orbiting the larger asteroid Didymos, was never a threat to Earth. After DART’s collision, Dimorphos shed debris and its orbit shortened by 33 minutes, confirming that the deflection was successful. However, scientists suspect that Dimorphos may not be a solid rock but rather a loose collection of rubble held together by gravity, adding complexity to understanding how these small bodies behave. By studying the results of the DART impact, Hera will offer valuable insights into the nature of asteroids and how Earth can protect itself from potential future threats.
