    "text": "Un sacerdote de Florida, en Estados Unidos, es investigado por morder la mano de una feligresa durante la Eucaristía dominical en un supuesto “intento de defender la comunión”, según la declaración jurada del caso citada este viernes por medios estadounidenses. El incidente ocurrió el pasado 19 de mayo en la Iglesia de Santo Tomás de Aquino en la ciudad de St. Cloud, al sur de Orlando. Según información de CNN, en la misa de la mañana el sacerdote Fidel Rodríguez se negó a darle la Comunión a una mujer porque ella no se había confesado. El sacerdote bendijo a la mujer y le aconsejó “recibir el sacramento de la Penitencia (confesión) antes de recibir la sagrada Eucaristía”, explicó en un comunicado la Diócesis de Orlando. La mujer regresó para la misa del mediodía y cuando fue a recibir la Comunión, el padre Rodríguez le preguntó nuevamente si se había confesado, y ella respondió que “no era asunto suyo”. Luego, la mujer metió la mano en la bandeja de la Comunión, agarró las hostias y comenzó a romperlas. El padre Rodríguez intentó sujetar a la mujer, pero ella se negó a detenerse. Durante el forcejeo, la feligresa empujó al sacerdote. En respuesta, él le mordió la mano. Tras el incidente, la Diócesis defendió las acciones del padre Rodríguez.\"Si bien la Diócesis de Orlando no tolera altercados físicos como este, de buena fe, el padre Rodríguez simplemente estaba intentando evitar un acto de profanación de la Sagrada Comunión, que, como sacerdote, está obligado a proteger\", dijeron en un comunicado. El padre Rodríguez admitió lo sucedido a la Policía y dijo que estaba actuando en defensa propia. La mujer se negó a recibir atención médica y las autoridades fotografiaron la marca de la mordedura, según los documentos judiciales citados por CNN. La policía de St. Cloud ha enviado el caso a la Oficina del Fiscal de Florida para que decida si impone cargos al sacerdote.

    "title": "SSEN ‘confident’ of restoring power to all homes on Friday after Storm Gerrit | Your Local Guardian",
    "text": "Electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after Storm Gerrit will be reconnected on Friday. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said “hard work” by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by Friday morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a “much improved picture”. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had “made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions”. He said: “We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. “And we’re confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.” He thanked those affected for their “ongoing patience” as the power firm makes its “final push” to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a “lot of localised faults” to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a “lot of points of multiple damage”. This he said was “down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit”, adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. He insisted SSEN had been “well prepared” for this latest blast of wintry weather, but added that “we saw some wind speeds five to 10 miles per hour higher than predicted”. Winds at Inverbervie, on the Aberdeenshire cost, reached 86mph during Storm Gerrit, he said – adding this was higher than the 78mph winds that hit the town during Storm Arwen in November 2021. The latest storm was “more ferocious than forecast”, Mr Geddie stated. But he stressed: “We’re very confident of getting all homes reconnected through the course of today. “We’re got enough people and resource and we are absolutely committed in this final push.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains\nSANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.

In the period from April 2023 to November 2023, Uttar Pradesh achieved the highest supply of 28,284 MW securing the top position in the country. The state’s energy and urban development minister AK Sharma shared this accomplishment on social media here on Thursday, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“Uttar Pradesh surpassed Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan to claim the top spot, demonstrating a remarkable increase in electricity supply,” Sharma said highlighting the state’s commitment to providing even better electricity with new production capacity.UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said the demand in 2024-25 might cross 30,000 MW. “The energy corporations need to upgrade their distribution and transmission systems in advance to avoid any repeat of the grim situation that consumers faced during last summer despite meeting record demand,” he said.",

    "text": "El presidente Javier Milei habló este jueves en el Congreso de Inversiones Inmobiliarias, que se realizó en el Hotel Hilton de Puerto Madero. Allí, el mandatario volvió a hacer referencia a “la peor herencia que recibió un gobierno en la historia argentina” e insistió en que la inflación anual se proyectaba al 7.500% anual. \"Ahora están preocupados por la pobreza , los indigentes, pero parece que en los cuatro años anteriores no había ni pobres ni indigentes \", apuntó. \"Lamentablemente, la deshonestidad intelectual del kirchnerismo y sus aliados políticos nos obligan a contar por qué lo que estamos haciendo. En el resto del mundo se considera un milagro, mientras que acá comienzan a encontrar cosas como la pobreza y la indigencia, como si gestara en ocho meses\", afirmó el presidente. Además se refirió a las importaciones durante el último período del gobierno anterior: \"Solamente se pagaban el 15%. Les aviso que hoy están por encima del 90%\". Suscribite Visitas a Javier Milei en Olivos: Villarruel no pisa la Quinta y quiénes son los funcionarios con asistencia perfecta \"La gran apuesta del gobierno anterior, ellos no creían que éramos liberales libertarios, sino libertarios libertarados\", agregó. \"Uno de los indicadores tempranos de crisis son los déficits gemelos, combinación de fiscal y de cuenta corrientes. Cuando es de 4% es alerta amarilla y 8% es alerta roja. Nosotros heredamos 17 puntos del PBI, donde 15 eran generados por el Estado, el Tesoro y el Banco Central\", afirmó Milei. Ministerio de la Mujer \"Estoy orgulloso que haber eliminado el siniestro Ministerio de la Mujer y el siniestro INADI que se usaban para perseguir ideológicamente\", sentenció con respecto a la reforma del Estado. \"Estos días fui reivindicado, porque una periodista militante dijo que 'yo te creo hermana' era una cuestión retórica y de acción política. Terminó de confesar que era una forma de perseguir a opositores, cargándoles delitos aberrantes que después nos enteramos que cometen ellos\", comentó en referencia a Julia Mengolini. \"Un econochanta pasado de tintura negra decía que u ajuste de más de 1% del PBI era imposible y querer hacer un ajuste de 5 puntos era imposible. El ajuste terminó siendo de 7 puntos del PBI\", disparó el presidente. \"Aunque el número de julio da negativo, el déficit fiscal, en el acumulado nos sobra dinero. De hecho, en la cuenta del Banco Central tenemos 17 billones de pesos acumulados. El programa de déficit ceros igue y de acá a find e años vamos a terminar absorbiendo 9 billones de pesos adicionales. Por lo tanto, el resultado fiscal está garantizado y ya hemos garantizado el rollover de la deuda para parte del año que viene\", anunció Milei. \"Argentina hizo un ajuste fiscal en 6 meses de 15 puntos del PBI, algo que no se ha visto nunca en la historia de la humanidad y de esa manera hemos qparado la hiperinflación. En diciembre veníamos viajando al 17.000%. El último dato de inflación mayorista fue de 2,7% y, anualizado, pasamos 17.000% al 35%. Como además tenemos una pauta de devaluación de 2% mensual, la inflación viene viajando a menos del 0,7% y eso quiere decir que anualizada, hoy la inflación estaría viajando de manera pura a eso del 8% anual\". \"Debe ser por eso que en el mundo hablan del milagro económico en Argentina y la miserabilidad de los 'econochantas' y de los políticos no les permite reconocer la gesta heroica\", afirmó Milei. Visitas a Javier Milei en Olivos: Villarruel no pisa la Quinta y quiénes son los funcionarios con asistencia perfecta Las críticas de Milei a Mauricio Macri Con respecto a Patricia Bullrich al frente del Ministerio de Seguridad, Milei dijo que \"no solo tuvo la grandeza de aceptar el cargo sino que está exterminando la inseguridad y se terminaron los malditos piquetes que nos arruinaban cada día\". Para Milei, la combinación del DNU y la Ley Bases es 8 veces la reforma estructural del gobierno de Carlos Menem. \"Acabamos de hacer la reforma más grande de la historia argentina. Tenemos pendientes 3.200 reformas estructurales\". “Hay que pensar mucho para decir que no hay gestión en este gobierno. El que lo entendió, lo entendió. No es un palo a quien le tengo mucha estima”, en referencia a Mauricio Macri. \"Estamos escribiendo el presupuesto para asegurar el cumplimiento del déficit cero. El gobierno va a presentar un presupuesto que parte del déficit cero, es la regla. No vamos a tomar nunca toma de deuda para financiar el fisco\". Más frases de Milei en el Congreso de Inversiones Inmobiliarias - \"En el caso de que los ingresos vengan por arriba, prepárense porque empezamos con la baja de impuestos\". - \"No me pueden negar que ha sido un verdadero éxito eliminar la ley de alquileres\" y \"hoy han vuelto los créditos hipotecarios a 30 años\". - \"Debe haber algo que me tiene hecho un poeta\", bromeó, sin mencionar su inesperado noviazgo con Amalia \"Yuyito\" González. \"Nuestro mejor momento\": el gobierno de Javier Milei aprovecha el escándalo de Alberto Fernández para gestionar en silencio - \"Cuando Luis Caputo y Santiago Bausili estaban en reunión con los bancos para cerrar el tema de los puts, vino la puñalada artera del Banco Macro ejecutando 2.000 millones de dólares en un día para generar un proceso de zozobra económico para tirar por las nubes al gobierno y es la primera vez que un gobierno argentino enfrentó a una corrida de 2.000 millones de dólares y no nos pudieron voltear\", recordó Milei. - \"Como fallaron eso, a la semana siguiente estaban hablando de que iban a buscar un tipo de cambio de 2.000 pesos\". - \"Está subiendo el salario real de la Argentina y las jubilaciones están mejor que en diciembre del año pasado. Estamos teniendo una recomposición de masa salarial que se va a transformar en demanda y, dada la capacidad instalada ociosa, permite expandir la actividad sin impactar en precios\". - \"Cuando nosotros asumimos, el riesgo país estaba en 2.200 puntos básicos y hoy les doy la noticia de que rompió la línea de los 1.500 a pesar de los degenerados fiscales. Que caiga el riesgo país significa que la tasa de interés va a caer, la acumulación de capital va aumentar y obviamente, cuando esto se dé, va aumentar el empleo, los salarios reales y esto va a hacer que caiga la cantidad de pobres e indigentes\". - Finalmente, Javier Milei expresó: \"A nosotros no nos alcanza ir a niveles de libertad económica como Alemania, Italia o Francia. Queremos ser el país más libre del mundo. Todos los días sacamos regulaciones. Aquellos países que son 12 veces más ricos que los países reprimidos y 25 veces menos en el formato estándar y 50 veces en el formato extremo. Le pido que no nos acompañen como meros espectadores disfrutando del milagro que hará a la Argentina más grande, sino que sean actores\". LM / Gi",

    "title": "Costa Rica: Paradise of Accessible Ecotourism",
    "text": "In a world that often seems tailored exclusively for the able-bodied, Costa Rica emerges as a beacon of inclusivity, gently weaving the vibrant tapestry of its ecological wonders with the golden threads of accessibility. This Central American paradise, known for its lush rainforests, pristine beaches, and diverse wildlife, is now pioneering a movement to ensure nature's marvels are accessible to all, regardless of physical ability. From the heart of its bustling capital, San José, to the serene and biodiverse corners of Maquenque and Selva Verde, Costa Rica offers a seamless blend of adventure and accessibility that beckons travelers from around the globe.\nTrailblazers in Accessible Ecotourism\nCosta Rica's commitment to accessible travel shines through its array of accommodations and experiences designed to welcome everyone. Prestigious lodgings such as Tabacón Thermal Resort & Spa, Bosque del Mar, and Los Altos Resort, to name a few, lead the charge by offering facilities and services that cater to the needs of travelers with disabilities. These include wheelchair-friendly rooms, paths, and even zip lines at Sky Adventures Arenal Park, ensuring that the thrill of soaring through the treetops is an experience shared by all.\nA Journey Through Nature's Splendor\nThe itinerary for accessible travel in Costa Rica is as diverse as the country's ecosystems. Starting in San José, a city where the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum and Jade Museum welcome visitors with open arms and accessible entrances, the journey unfolds to reveal the natural beauty and cultural heritage of this vibrant nation. Travelers can explore the wheelchair-friendly paths of Lankester Botanical Garden, embark on accessible tours in Tortuguero National Park, Manuel Antonio National Park, and Arenal Volcano National Park, and relax in accommodations nestled near rich biodiversity areas. Birdwatching, visits to research stations, and sampling local foods are just a few of the experiences that make this itinerary a testament to Costa Rica's inclusivity.\nCreating a Welcoming Coastline for All\nCosta Rica's beaches are famed for their crystal-clear waters and powdery sands, and thanks to the efforts of organizations like Red Costarricense de Turismo Accesible, these coastal paradises are becoming more accessible. With 15 beaches already equipped with features like wheelchair-friendly paths and specialized equipment for water activities, the dream of enjoying the ocean's embrace is now a reality for travelers with mobility challenges. Accessible tour operators such as Dive the Americas and Il Viaggio further extend the possibilities, offering diving, sightseeing, and exploration adventures tailored to meet the needs of all visitors.\nCosta Rica's initiative to make its natural and cultural treasures accessible to travelers with disabilities is not just about removing physical barriers; it's about creating an inclusive environment where the spirit of adventure knows no bounds. This commitment to accessibility, coupled with the nation's breathtaking biodiversity, makes Costa Rica a shining example of how travel can and should be accessible to everyone. Through thoughtful planning and a deep respect for both nature and humanity, Costa Rica invites us to explore its wonders, proving that the beauty of our world is truly meant to be shared by all.",

    "title": "Warhammer 40K Deathwing Assault Box Review - Lumbering Power",
    "text": "This week, we're taking a look at a brand new box set to boost our Dark Angels Space Marines forces. Games Workshop provided us a copy of this new release, so read on for our thoughts in our Deathwing Assault Box review. What's Included in The Deathwing Assault Box? The new Deathwing Assault box includes a small but mighty fighting force for the Dark Angels Space Marines chapter. The box contents are as follows: - Codex Supplement: Dark Angels - Datasheet Cards: Dark Angels - Dark Angels Transfer Sheet - Assembly Guide - 10 Terminators - 2 Dark Angels Upgrade Frames - 5 Deathwing Knights - Belial - 3 Watchers in the Dark - 3 Teleport Homers Deathwing Assault Box Review - A Look At The Units Let's take a moment to really dive into the three different types of units included in this box, before exploring what it all means to put these together in a force. Belial Grand Master Belial is an Epic Hero leader, who can be attached to the following units: Deathwing Knights (more on them in a moment), Deathwing Terminator Squad, Terminator Assault Squad, Terminator Squad. His stats are: - Move: 5\" - Toughness: 5 - Save: 2+ - Invulnerable Save: 4+ - Wounds: 6 - Leadership: 6+ - Objective Control: 1 Armed with his Master-crafted storm bolter (Precision, Rapid Fire 2), and The Sword of Silence (Precision), when he leads a unit, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, if a Critical Hit is scored, the attack has the (Precision) ability. What's the Precision ability? It's a cool rule that allows you, when attacking an enemy unit with a character attached to it, to ignore the normal rules of how wounds are assigned (usually it goes everyone else gets wounded first, then the character) and deal damage directly to the character. Belial also has the Strikes of Retribution ability, which gives him the chance (with good dice rolling) to deal back 1 mortal wound for each melee wound assigned to him. Deathwing Terminator Squad When you think of Dark Angels and the Deathwing, I would hazard a guess that it's these big, stompy baddies you're thinking of! The Deathwind Terminator Squad has the following stats: - Move: 5\" - Toughness: 5 - Save: 2+ - Invulnerable Save: 4+ - Wounds: 3 - Leadership: 6+ - Objective Control: 1 Armed with a storm bolter and a power fist, players have the opportunity to upgrade 1 in every 5 Terminator models' weapons, swapping out the built-in options with things like an assault cannon, heavy flamer, plasma cannon, or chainfist. But what makes Terminator units so special isn't just that they're heavily armored super soldiers, it's that they can teleport onto the battlefield with a homing beacon. Add to that that Deathwing Terminators also come with a Watcher in the Dark that gives them the Feel No Pain 4+ rule against mortal wounds until the end of the phase. Add to all that their \"Deathwing,\" ability, which allows you to ignore all modifiers to your Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill, and adds a 1 to the Hit roll if you're targeting your Oath of Moment mark (that's a special ability granted to all Space Marines). Deathwing Knights I love the look of these models, carrying their mace of absolution, or their sword (a power weapon), while draped in cloaks. Their stats are (and keen eyed observers will notice a trend): - Move: 5\" - Toughness: 5 - Save: 2+ - Invulnerable Save: 4+ - Wounds: 4 - Leadership: 6+ - Objective Control: 1 Touting only melee weapons (you can opt for a sword or a mace), and with many of the same abilities as the Terminator Squad (teleporting in, Watcher in the Dark) they also have the \"Inner Circle\" special rule, which is powerful! And states: Inner Circle: Each time an attack is allocated to a model in this unit, subtract 1 from the Damage characteristic of that attack. Is this for real!? They're already a 5 toughness, so to automatically subtract 1 damage from all attacks sent their way means they're here to hang around for a while, chopping through the battlefield. Deathwing Assault Box Review - Tactical Thoughts With all that being said, I think the smart move here is to build out a nasty little corner of your Dark Angels forces with this crew. And to do so, I would definitely recommend attaching your Belial to the Deathwing Knights. Doing so will give all Critical Hits (a to-hit roll of 6) from these Knights the Precision keyword. So beam them into the middle of the battlefield with their Teleport Homer, and then go character hunting! Think how nasty that would be! Deathwing Assault Box Review - Final Thoughts The power on display here is no joke. Points-wise, this box (without upgrading) is worth 785 points - nothing to sneeze at. If you're building out a Dark Angels army, this is a quick and efficient way to add some serious heft - if the MSRP ends up being more than you're looking for, however, you can always pick up individual units from this box. Also Out This Week For Warhammer 40K Also releasing this week, to coincide with the release of the Deathwing Assault Box as described above, is the Dark Angels Codex. Releasing separately (as well as boxed with the Deathwing Assault), this Codex Supplement has all the lore, datasheets, special rules, and more you could want for your Deathwing Squad. Also coming out this week is Crusade: Pariah Nexus, a 120-page campaign book for Warhammer 40K. This book covers the most recent events in the war in the Nephilim Sector, and provides rules for running a campaign there. With new enhancements and battle plans, Crusade: Pariah Nexus is a great option for the thematic, story-driven player out there. Are you excited for the Deathwing Assault box?
