    "title": "16 nuns denounce Pope Francis, break from Catholic Church under excommunicated Bishop",
    "text": "Pablo de Rojas Sánchez-Franco, a self-styled bishop who was excommunicated in 2019, will now have jurisdiction over 16 Spanish nuns who have announced their decision to leave the Catholic Church.\nBased in the northern Spanish dioceses of Burgos and Vitoria, the 16 Poor Clare nuns belonged to the Franciscan Order of Saint Clare.\nThe schism comes amid conservative outrage over Pope Francis&apos; leadership. Letters to \"all Cardinals and Bishops of the Catholic Church,\" written in February by 90 Catholic clergymen and scholars, urged them to oppose a document that the pope endorsed that permitted priests to bless same-sex couples.\nThe 16 sisters, led by Sister Isabel of the Trinity, released a five-page open statement on their convent website announcing their split from Catholic authority.\nSister Isabel wrote that Catholics had to put up with \"the silence of our pastors,\" who \"left their sheep alone and helpless to face the wolves.\"\nPope asks Italians to have babies: &apos;No shortage of little dogs, cats. There is a lack of children&apos;\n\"We have been receiving contradiction, confusion and doublespeak, ambiguity, lack of clear doctrine, which is all the more necessary in stormy times, to hold the rudder more firmly,\" she continued, referring to the pope.\nDespite Sánchez-Franco&apos;s excommunication by the Vatican, the sister said that the group would instead recognise him as a \"legitimate bishop of the Holy Catholic Church\" and place itself under his leadership.\nThe 16 sisters were under the supervision of Archbishop Mario Iceta of Burgos, who stated in a broadcast on Spanish radio station COPE that he \"thought it was fake news\" when he first learned they were going, according to the Catholic News Agency.\nAccording to the Catholic News Agency, the archbishop said, \"I don&apos;t know if they realize the profound consequences that this step has and that is why my option or my opinion is that this should not be done precipitously, let this media tidal wave pass, let&apos;s see if it&apos;s possible to establish a relationship with them and dialogue and look at these issues and give them time to reconsider this situation that seems so surprising and strange to me.\"",

They’ll also stay on probation for the remainder of their academic careers at the university. The decision came after a 13-hour disciplinary hearing on July 30. Students can appeal. [AU students moving in this week before heading back to school](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/07/au-students-moving-this-week-before-heading-back-school/) It’s almost back-to-school time for Augusta University students and for the first semester with the new chief. An attorney representing two of the suspended students, Josh Lingsch, called the hearing “nothing more than a kangaroo court” in a Thursday statement. Campus police arrested 16 protesters who set up an encampment near university President Jere Morehead’s office on the Athens campus in April. The school suspended the students hours later. Some students informally resolved charges with the school by acknowledging their violations, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. [New AARP poll shows Ga. toss-up between Trump, Harris](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/08/new-aarp-poll-shows-ga-toss-up-between-trump-harris/) “Georgia voters 50-plus say they would be more likely to vote for candidates who commit to protecting Social Security and supporting family caregivers,” the association said. During the hearing, the six remaining students said they had a right to protest and none of their actions interrupted academic activities. When they tried to comply with orders to move, students [said](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/news/education/campus/2024/08/06/uga-student-panel-upholds-sanctions-imposed-on-6-suspended-students/74690147007/) officers used force and tried to end their protest. The students also expressed anger with Israel’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war and what they say is the university’s support for Israel.

    "text": "Luigi Mangione, suspected of having assassinated an American health insurance boss in revenge against this sector, was transferred Thursday to New York where he appeared for the first time before federal justice.\nThe transfer was carefully staged by US authorities and news channels showed the 26-year-old, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, being slowly escorted by helmeted law enforcement men with submachine guns slung over their shoulders. , after landing in New York aboard a helicopter.\nThe city’s mayor, Eric Adams, who heads the New York police force, accompanied the procession.\nThe engineering graduate, a brilliant former student from a wealthy Baltimore family, was then presented for the first time before federal judge Katharine Parker, who read him the charges, including that of using a firearm. fire to kill in early December in the heart of New York’s business district Brian Thompson, the CEO of the country’s first private health insurer, UnitedHealthcare.\nFacts punishable by death or life in prison, the American Department of Justice said in a press release.\n– “Terrorism” –\nIn the morning, Luigi Mangione appeared in a Pennsylvania state court near where he was arrested on December 9. He did not contest his transfer to New York and he arrived calmly, unlike the day after his arrest when he appeared agitated and vehement, throwing the words: “It is an insult to the intelligence of the people American”.\nThe federal prosecutions are now in addition to those decided by the local Manhattan prosecutor’s office, notably for murder linked to an “act of terrorism”.\nSince December 4, the assassination has provoked numerous condemnations, but also a deluge of hateful comments on social networks against American health insurance programs, illustrating deep anger towards a system accused to prioritize profit over care and to unfairly refuse medical care.\nLuigi Mangione received support on social networks. On Thursday, a few demonstrators made the trip to the courts where he appeared, some wearing a t-shirt with his image, or a sign proclaiming: “Health insurance practices terrorize the population”.\nIn a document summarizing the charges, investigators said they had no doubt that Luigi Mangione had planned his act.\nIn a notebook found on him during his arrest, he wrote on the date “8/15” (August 15) that “the target is insurance”, because it “checks all the boxes”. As of October 22, 2024, he adds: “1.5 months. An investor conference is a real godsend.” On the morning of December 4, Brian Thompson was scheduled to attend an investor conference.\n– No accomplice –\nLuigi Mangione also carried a letter with him to the authorities, in which he took care to specify that he had no accomplice.\nThe praise he received was condemned by the authorities, and the New York police expressed concern in an internal memo that Luigi Mangione was becoming an “example to follow”.\nFor American justice, “Mangione carefully planned the execution of Brian Thompson in order to launch a public debate on the health sector”.\n“But it was not a debate, it was a murder,” said Manhattan federal prosecutor Edward Y. Kim.\nAccording to investigators, Luigi Mangione traveled by bus from Atlanta to New York about ten days before the crime and checked into a hotel, using a fake driver’s license.\nOn December 4, he went out around 5:35 a.m. and waited for his target for an hour, in the dark of night, in front of his hotel, before shooting him in cold blood. He flees on an electric bike, then by taxi and manages to leave the city.\nBut five days later, the man whose partially masked face appeared on video surveillance cameras was recognized by an employee of a McDonald’s in the small rural town of Altoona, 500 km west of New York.\nWhen the police arrived on scene, Luigi Mangione provided the same driver’s license that was used in the New York hotel and the police found on him a weapon similar to the one used to kill Brian Thompson.",

Sono stati iscritti nella Lista delle Riserve Mondiali della Biodiversità: luoghi esemplari in cui lo sviluppo economico, sociale e culturale è sostenibile e trae giovamento dal rispetto dell'ecosistema e della biodiversità\". Così il presidente della Regione del Veneto Luca Zaia annuncia l'esito dell'incontro del Consiglio intergovernativo dell'Unesco riunito in questi giorni ad Agadir in Marocco, che ha decretato l'iscrizione del sito veneto dei Colli Euganei nella Lista Mab dell'Unesco. La decisione è stata presa all'unanimità dai delegati dei 35 Stati membri del Consiglio intergovernativo in rappresentanza degli oltre 180 Stati parte del programma Mab dell'Unesco.\nLa rete delle Riserve mondiali Mab Unesco si compone di 748 siti in tutto il mondo di cui 20 in Italia. Sono luoghi vivi e unici al mondo, in cui è possibile assicurare uno sviluppo eco-compatibile e un ambiente vivibile in un contesto globale caratterizzato da processi di rapida urbanizzazione e di eccessivo consumo energetico considerati come fattori scatenanti dei cambiamenti climatici. Con il risultato di oggi, il Veneto arriva a 18 riconoscimenti Unesco conquistando il record nazionale: 9 siti patrimonio materiale (da Venezia a Verona, da Vicenza a Padova, dalle Dolomiti a Conegliano e Valdobbiadene, dai siti palafitticoli alle opere di difesa veneziane), 5 patrimoni immateriali (Arte delle perle di vetro, Tocatì, Transumanza, Muretti a secco, Opera lirica), 4 riserve Mab (Po Grande, Delta del Po, Monte Grappa, Colli Euganei). Per i Colli ora si aprono nuovi scenari, siamo pronti ad un grande progetto di promozione e sviluppo. \"La candidatura dei Colli Euganei è stata avanzata a settembre 2023 dal presidente del Comitato Nazionale Mab Unesco, professor Pier Luigi Petrillo che ringrazio - ricorda il presidente Zaia -. Nel documento si evidenziavano le caratteristiche dei Colli Euganei che vantano un paesaggio spettacolare caratterizzato da un gruppo di 81 pittoresche colline vulcaniche di altezza variabile da 300 metri a 600 metri nella Pianura Padovano-Veneta a sud-ovest della città di Padova, tra cui il Monte Venda, la collina più alta della regione, oltre a centri termali e a una rigogliosa pianura agricola con numerosi uliveti e vigneti. Il dossier, promosso dal Parco regionale dei Colli Euganei, è stato seguito passo dopo passo dalla regione Veneto che ha sempre creduto in questo progetto\". (ANSA). .",

Traoré se livre dans cette interview.\nBetrand, le Burkina- Faso a bien débuté cette CAN avec un court succès contre la Mauritanie, n'est-ce-pas?\nEffectivement. Il fallait absolument ne pas se rater durant ce match inaugural contre une équipe de la Mauritanie qui nous a donne du fil à retordre. Nous avons cru jusqu'au bout et on a enfin trouvé la faille dans le temps additionnel. Je pense que c'est important de commencer cette compétition par une victoire. Certes, au Cameroun, nous avons perdu lors du match d'ouverture, mais cela ne nous a pas empêchés d'atteindre le dernier carré et de perdre face au tenant du titre, le Sénégal. Toutefois, je pense que c'est toujours bien de commencer un tournoi fermé par une victoire.\nCette année, on imagine, les ambitions sont grandes pour vous ?\nLe peuple Burkinabé attend beaucoup de nous cette année. Ils veulent nous voir atteindre la finale et pourquoi-pas remporté cette coupe d'Afrique. Je pense qu'on a un bon groupe, un mix entre les anciens expérimentés et les nouveaux qui se sont bien intégrés. Nous avons les moyens physiques et techniques pour faire mal durant ce tournoi. En tous, nous n'avons peur de personne durant cette CAN2023.\nVous allez affronté l'Algérie, samedi au stade de la Paix de Bouaké, comment se présente ce choc pour vous?\nC'est un match comme tout les autres pour nous. Nous avons besoin des trois points pour valider notre ticket pour les huitièmes de finale. A' nous de faire le job alors pour remporter ce match.\nL'équipe d'Algérie est dos au mur après son match nul contre l'Angola, ce qui rendra la rencontre de samedi compliquée pour vous, n'est- ce- pas ?\nJe vais me répéter, on ne craint personne. Nous allons aborder ce match face à l'Algérie avec la ferme intention de vaincre. La victoire face à la Mauritanie va nous donner des ailes pour sortir un grand match face à l'Algérie qui est une équipe redoutable aussi.\nCliquez ici pour lire l'article sur le site d'Africa Top Sports.",

    "text": "Natural fireworks from Mother Nature this 4th of July\nOur storm chances will continue into Friday before we see much better weather the second half of the holiday weekend\nIt was definitely hot as a firecracker for the 4th of July on Thursday across Central and Eastern Kentucky with upper 80s and low 90s for afternoon highs. Add in ridiculously high humidity (dewpoints in the mid to upper 70s…which is rare) and heat indices surged into the low 100s across much of the area so it was super uncomfortable for outdoor Independence Day festivities. With a slow moving warm front to our northwest and lots of available moisture, heavy rain producing thunderstorms fired up during the afternoon hours with a few of those producing some gusty winds and even a few severe thunderstorm warnings. Folks definitely had to keep an eye on the weather throughout the day.\nHeading into Friday our unsettled and stormy pattern will hang on for one more day as a cold front eventually sweeps through the region by the end of the day. It will be another warm and humid day which will help fuel additional showers and thunderstorms. While the overall coverage shouldn’t be widespread we could see some localized heavy downpours and gusty winds with any storms that develop. There is a low end Level 1 severe risk (out of 5) for Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky, basically east and southeast of Lexington with damaging winds being the primary threat.\nThe frontal boundary will do a great job of sweeping out a good chunk of the high humidity as it moves eastward setting us up for a tremendous second half of the holiday weekend. The “muggy-cast” takes a huge dip for Saturday and Sunday and most importantly we should be rain-free with sunshine and highs in the mid to upper-80s. I suppose this is the payoff for having to deal with the stormy and unsettled weather to begin the holiday weekend.\nLooking ahead to early next week we should shift back into a more typical early to mid-July pattern with warm and muggy conditions returning. Monday could be a touch hot with highs in the low-90s and just a few isolated storms. With more moisture and clouds around heading into the mid-week, daily storm chances are on tap with highs in the upper-80s. We’ll have to see if some of the remnant moisture from Beryl funnels our way during that window. The latest drought monitor has much of the Bluegrass Region in the “abnormally dry” range so we could use some additional rainfall.\nABC 36 HOUR FORECAST\nTHURSDAY NIGHT: Warm and muggy with isolated storms. Lows in the mid-70s.\nFRIDAY: Humid with more storms. Highs in the upper-80s.\nFRIDAY NIGHT: Drying out, more comfortable. Lows in the mid-60s.",

    "text": "You have a friend in Jesus Flat tires are no fun. I had a rash of them ten years ago. Every time I turned around I had to either inflate the tire, get it patched or replaced. I thought about that when I saw a man with his car up on a jack. I was in a hurry with one of my flats. I drove the car to the gas station with the front driver's side tire nearly deflated. That's when I noticed a screw embedded in the tread. When I told my wife about the tire she quickly accused me of driving somewhere I shouldn't have. The truth is that when bad things happen to you, it doesn't mean that you deserve it. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Rabbi Harold Kushner wrote the book on it. He concluded that bad things are as much a part of our human experience as are the good things. We live in a fallen world. Sometimes we bring things on ourselves by the things we do. The Apostle Paul writes about our tendency to fall into bad habits without even thinking. He says in Romans 7, \"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but I do what I hate to do...\" Does that sound familiar? I think we can relate to that. Just ask someone who has tried to lose weight about their experience. Speak to someone who has tried to quit smoking. They will tell you how often they end up sabotaging themselves. Trials and temptations are all real and they are everywhere. Put a plate of cookies in front of me and you can guess what happens? So what do you do? You face your trials head on. Too often, we avoid the problems instead of dealing with them. We hope they will go away on their own. The good news is that we don't have to confront them alone. Jesus said he would be with us. When we are feeling overwhelmed we can call on him in prayer. He will stand beside us as we confront our challenges. As we get ready to enter a new year, don't just make some resolutions to try harder. Call on Jesus to give you what you need. I love the James Taylor song, \"You've Got A Friend.\" When I hear that song, I think of Jesus. He is that kind of friend. I know that wherever I am, all I got to do is call his name and he'll be there. The Apostle Paul tells us that we can do all things through Christ who gives us strength. He may not fix a flat tire for you or me. But he will be there to see us through. Praise God! Happy New Year. See you in church.",

The Matildas crashed out of the [Paris 2024 Olympic Games](https://www.newidea.com.au/entertainment/olympics/paris-olympics/) after losing their final group stage match against the USA 2 – 1. Dreams of an [Olympic medal](https://www.newidea.com.au/news/australia-paris-olympics-medal-count/) for Australia in women’s soccer have now been put on the back burner until 2028 when the girls in the green and gold will endeavour to play at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. This heartbreaking loss comes after the team defeated Zambia 6 – 5 earlier this week, and lost against Germany 3 – 0 days prior. By not winning against the US Women’s National Team, the Matildas were unable to secure their spot in the quarter-finals. When the draw was first announced, Head Coach Tony Gustavsson said it was a “huge win” for the team, especially considering they would be avoiding last year’s World Cup winners Spain, host nation France, and Tokyo gold medalists Canada in what would be a “pool of death.” While Germany and the USA are ranked fourth and fifth to Australia’s 12th in the global ranking, Matikdas progressed significantly further than either team in the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup. In fact, Germany didn’t even progress past the group stage, meanwhile, former World Cup winners USA won just a single game in their group stage matches. Zambia is currently ranked 64 out of the 193 globally ranked teams in the FIFA Women’s Soccer world rankings. Following a fourth-place finish at the World Cup and at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, fans were hopeful that at the Paris Olympic Games, the Matildas would secure a podium finish – but alas this wasn’t the case.
