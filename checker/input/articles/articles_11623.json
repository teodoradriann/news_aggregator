Urging residents to remain in their homes, he said: \"Right now the most important thing is to safeguard as many lives as possible.\"\nCities such as Valencia and Malaga were inundated this week after nearly a year's worth of rain – close to half a metre – fell in just eight hours in some areas, leaving residents \"trapped like rats\" in homes and cars, as described by one desperate local mayor recalling the chaos.\nFloods deposited cars in piled heaps on streets thick with mud ( AFP via Getty )\nAs volunteers engage in a huge clean-up effort after the floods swept away bridges and deposited cars and other debris in piled heaps on streets thick with mud, Spain's transport minister Oscar Puente said…\nAndy Gregory",
