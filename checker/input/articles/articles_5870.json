    "text": "By Amanda Blankenship July 25, 2024 News Katie Hauss set out to enjoy a day of watching some of her favorite celebrities golf at the American Century Championship on July 12. Among the list of celebs present was Travis Kelce . What she didn’t expect was for the NFL player to send a golf ball straight into the back of her head. Here’s what happened.\nKatie Hauss Got Knocked Down By Travis Kelce’s Golf Ball Without any warning, Katie said that she felt something hit the back of her head. “When I got hit, I immediately felt pain,” she told People . At that point, she said she was “trying to focus on not blacking out.”\n“I didn’t really know what had happened,” Katie admitted. “I then heard people start yelling and screaming that it was Travis Kelce’s golf shot, and ‘Oh my god, that girl just got hit in the head.’”\nThe 37-year-old looked to her husband, Ryan Griffiths, for support. She told him that she believed she was okay, but that the site where the golf ball hit her just hurt. “Then when I put my hand to my head there was a lot of blood,” Katie recalled.\nInstagram/Katie Hauss Griffiths Then, she said that a “Good Samaritan” stepped forward to help. The person applied pressure to the wound on her head and instructed her to stay still as they called in EMTs to their location. “I am just so appreciative to that man for helping me, a complete stranger, and I wish I could thank him for his kindness,” she said.\nTravis Kelce and his brother Jason were among the celebrities golfing that Friday. It was, in fact, Travis’ golf ball that struck the back of Katie’s head.\nNo Hard Feelings Between Katie & Travis After realizing what went down, Travis and Jason made their way over to make sure Katie was okay. “Travis must have walked down as I was still on the ground,” she said. “I just remember seeing him come up and then I don’t remember exactly what he said, but he asked if I was ok. I could tell that he felt really badly.”\nThe NFL joked and said that the least he could do was take a photo with the woman. Katie said that she stood up and joked that the front of her looked all right for photos.\n“Travis said that he couldn’t bring himself to smile given the circumstances,” she said. “I honestly felt bad for him, because I know that it was a total accident, and that can’t feel good to do that with a huge crowd looking on.”\nKatie also remembered that Travis Kelce’s brother, Jason, seemed to be really worried about her. He asked her if she was okay a number of times.\nWhen EMTs arrived, they realized Katie’s head had been split open. They suggested that she go to the hospital to make sure nothing serious happened as a result of the knock on her head. In the emergency room, she received several stitches and doctors confirmed she had a concussion.\nAn episode of the “ New Heights ” podcast didn’t age well. Prior to Jason and Travis Kelce making their way to the tournament, Travis joked, “Don’t feel bad if you hit somebody because they bought the ticket.”\nHowever, there are no hard feelings on Katie’s behalf. She says that she still can’t believe the entire ordeal happened.\nAuthor Recent Posts Amanda Blankenship Amanda Blankenship is an overcaffeinated wife and mother.

    "text": "The News 19 Weather Team has issued a Weather Impact Alert Day for Friday, as we could see another day of potentially dangerous heat levels. A heat advisory was issued Thursday as heat index values, or \"feels like temperatures,\" stayed in the triple digits. The chance for dangerous heat index values will return for Friday. High temperatures combined with high dew points could lead to heat index values reaching near 110 degrees Friday. Another heat advisory could be issued by the National Weather Service for the Midlands. The chance for isolated afternoon showers and storms stays lower for Friday. Any storms that do develop on Friday could be strong to severe, with the potential for damaging winds. Storm chances are expected to increase over the weekend. On both Saturday and Sunday, storms are more likely and could be more scattered. Heat Safety Tips - Stay Hydrated and Cool: Drink plenty of fluids and stay in an air-conditioned room. Avoid being outside in the sun for extended periods. Check on relatives and neighbors to ensure they are safe and comfortable. - Protect Children and Pets: Never leave young children or pets in unattended vehicles. Car interiors can reach deadly temperatures within minutes. - Outdoor Precautions: When outside, wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to the early morning or evening. Be alert to signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and act immediately if symptoms appear. - Workplace Safety: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) advises taking frequent rest breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas during outdoor work. If the heat has affected someone you are around, move them quickly to a cool, shaded area. A heat stroke is a medical emergency; call 911 immediately.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "text": "Incendio en la plataforma Cherne-1 lleva a IBP a suspender inspecciones de Petrobras en la Cuenca de Campos; La unidad ha estado funcionando durante 40 años, el doble de su vida útil esperada.\nUn incendio reciente en Plataforma Cherne-1, ubicada en la Cuenca de Campos dos Goytacazes (RJ), llevó al Instituto Brasileño de Petróleo y Gas (IBP) a suspender, como medida cautelar, el Sistema de Gestión de Inspección de Equipos (SPIE) de Petrobras en la Unidad de Negocio de la Cuenca de Campos (UN-BC).\nLa medida, aunque temporal, impone restricciones inmediatas a las operaciones de la empresa estatal hasta que se determinen las causas del accidente, cuya gravedad ha reavivado las discusiones sobre la integridad estructural de las unidades offshore que han excedido su vida útil diseñada.\nLa estructura de la plataforma Cherne-1 supera el límite operativo seguro\nLos informes técnicos preliminares indican que la plataforma Cherne-1, diseñada originalmente para operar durante 20 años, ya ha estado en funcionamiento durante cuatro décadas, el doble del tiempo previsto.\n-\nMargen Ecuatorial podría garantizar US$200 mil millones a Brasil, dice Ineep\n-\nTechnipFMC firma contrato con Petrobras para desarrollar un ducto resistente a la corrosión en el presal\n-\nBrava Energia aumenta producción a 82 mil barriles de petróleo\n-\nUna vasta infraestructura mueve mil millones de barriles de petróleo en el Puerto de Açu\nEsta discrepancia entre la vida útil prevista y la realidad operativa es una de las preocupaciones centrales del comité técnico que investiga el accidente.\nSe está analizando exhaustivamente el deterioro estructural de la unidad, con foco en posibles fallas que pudieron haber contribuido al incendio.\nMientras tanto, el IBP exige a Petrobras un plan de acción correctiva para recuperar la certificación completa.\nIBP aplica suspensión con base en estándares técnicos\nDe acuerdo con el punto 4.16 de las directrices que regulan el SPIE, la suspensión cautelar Se puede determinar siempre que ocurre un accidente importante, como el registrado en Cherne-1.\nLa medida fue adoptada de acuerdo con el dictamen de la Comisión de Certificación (ComCer), que deliberará sobre el mantenimiento del certificado entre el 13 y el 15 de mayo.\nEl punto 11.5 de la norma también establece que el certificado SPIE debe permanecer suspendido hasta que se presente un informe de investigación concluyente al Organismo de Certificación de Producto (OCP).\nLa decisión final de ComCer también considerará la información remitida por los órganos supervisores del Ministerio de Trabajo y Empleo (MTE).\nPetrobras mantiene rutinas operativas y seguridad a bordo\nEn un comunicado oficial, Petrobras informó que la suspensión cautelar “es una medida administrativa y no impacta las actividades de inspección y mantenimiento ya en marcha en la plataforma”.\nLa empresa reforzó que se siguen cumpliendo las rutinas establecidas “para mantener las condiciones de habitabilidad y seguridad de Cherne I, de acuerdo con la normativa vigente”.\nAdemás, la empresa estatal destacó que fue notificada formalmente por el IBP y que espera la conclusión del informe de investigación para las deliberaciones de ComCer.\nTres trabajadores permanecen hospitalizados en condición de salud estable\nEl incidente también dejó personas heridas. Según Petrobras, tres trabajadores permanecen hospitalizados, bajo seguimiento clínico, y su estado de salud se considera estable.\nEl caso de la plataforma Cherne-1 refuerza la necesidad de una mayor supervisión de las estructuras envejecidas en el sector del petróleo y el gas.\nLa continuidad de las operaciones en plataformas que exceden su vida útil sin modernizaciones adecuadas pueden suponer riesgos crecientes.",
