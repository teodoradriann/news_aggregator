    "text": "Renewable electricity to outstrip coal next year: IEA The amount of electricity produced from renewable sources worldwide is set to surpass output from coal-fired plants for the first time in 2025, the International [Energy](https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/energy/) Agency said Friday. The forecast comes as electricity demand is set to rise four percent this year and next, up from 2.5 percent in 2023. That would be the highest annual growth since 2007, excepting spikes seen after the global financial crisis that began that year and during the Covid-19 recovery, the Paris-based agency said. Soaring demand reflects \"the growing role of electricity in our economies as well as the impacts of severe heatwaves,\" said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director of energy markets and security. Hydroelectric, solar, wind and other renewable sources are forecast to provide 35 percent of global supply next year, up from 30 percent in 2023, the agency said. Solar alone is set to supply half the demand growth through 2025, with wind a further 25 percent. PAY ATTENTION: Share your outstanding story with our editors! Please reach us through info@corp.legit.ng! Coal use is not expected to decline, however, as electricity use soars in China and [India](https://hausa.legit.ng/tags/india-news-today/) in particular, the IEA said. Heatwaves across India are expected to lift electricity demand in the country by eight percent this year, while China's demand is expected to grow six percent. European demand is set to climb 1.7 percent. In the United States, where mild weather saw demand decrease last year, electricity use is set to rise three percent this year -- not least as the development of artificial intelligence spurs the creation of massive data centres. \"It's encouraging to see clean energy's share of the electricity mix continuing to rise, but this needs to happen at a much faster rate to meet international energy and climate goals,\" Sadamori said in a statement. He also urged officials to impose higher energy efficiency standards \"to reduce the impacts of increased cooling demand on power systems\".

Des images saisissantes ont circulé: corps vacillants, gestes désordonnés, regards vides. Le corps humain, pourtant préparé à l’extrême, montrait ses limites face à l’agression thermique. Ce n’était ni la distance, ni l’intensité qui avait eu raison des participants et des participantes, mais bien l’environnement. Cet épisode n’est pas isolé: il illustre une réalité de plus en plus prégnante dans le sport contemporain.\nLe stress thermique, lié à l’exposition à des températures élevées pendant l’effort, constitue une menace croissante pour la santé et la performance des athlètes, à l’heure du changement climatique et de la multiplication des compétitions internationales en zones chaudes. Il engendre une surcharge physiologique, altère la régulation thermique, et accroît le risque de pathologies graves (coup de chaleur, dysfonction cognitive, collapsus).",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Kanyakumari | Updated: 01-06-2024 10:24 IST | Created: 01-06-2024 10:24 IST - Country: - India Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarked on his second and final day of meditation here on Saturday, after performing the 'Surya Arghya' during sunrise at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial here, officials said. Modi carried out 'Surya Arghya,' a ritual associated with spiritual practice involving salutations to the Almighty, manifested in the form of sun. The PM poured little water from a traditional, beaker-like small vessel into the sea as an offering (Arghya) and prayed using his prayer beads (Japa mala), they said. Modi was clad in saffron and also paid floral tributes to a statue of Swami Vivekananda, they added. He walked around the mandapam with his 'japa mala' in his hands. Kanyakumari is famous for its sunrise and sunset and the memorial is located on a tiny islet near the shoreline. At the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, the PM embarked on meditation on the evening of May 30 and he is scheduled to complete it on the evening of Saturday.

    "text": "British defence giant BAE Systems was one of the biggest FTSE 100 risers yesterday as the industry was boosted by geopolitical tensions. On a quiet day for the London market, BAE’s share price rose 0.6 per cent, or 6.5p, to 1,102p after a report revealed its order book had jumped around £7billion in a year. Heightened global hostilities and ongoing conflicts have increased defence spending. The order books of the world’s biggest defence companies have been pushed to near record highs and the MSCI’s global benchmark for the industry’s stocks is up 25 per cent over the past 12 months. The war in Ukraine partly explains the increase but firms such as BAE Systems have also been buoyed by new orders for existing contracts. Boosted: On a quiet day for the London market, BAE’s share price rose 1.1% after a report revealed its order book had jumped around £7bn in a year The report revealed that BAE’s order backlog rose from £48.5billion to £55.5billion in 2022. And orders hit a record £66billion in the first half of this year. Meanwhile mining stocks also rose after copper prices jumped 1.36 per cent to 8,690.5p yesterday. Anglo American’s share price rose 0.5 per cent, or 9p, to 1,984.8p while Antofagasta was down 0.2 per cent, or 3p, at 1,707.5p. Glencore’s share price fell 0.4 per cent, or 1.7p, to 470.1p. Rio Tinto’s stock surged 0.6 per cent, or 35p, to 5,860p. Other risers included AstraZeneca, which continued to gain off the back of a £950million deal to buy Shanghai pharmaceutical company Gracell Biotechnology, which was announced on Boxing Day. The drugmaker’s share price jumped 0.4 per cent, or 46p, to 10,574p, with rival pharma giant GSK also up 0.8 per cent, or 11.6p, to 1,461.2p. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks was down 0.03 per cent, or 2.2 points, at 7,722.74p, while the midcap FTSE 250 index fell 0.01 per cent, or 1.6 points, to 19,719.16. Zanaga Iron Ore shares climbed after the company unveiled a deal to power its Republic of Congo project. The agreement has been signed with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). CMEC will complete inspections on the sites near Zanaga and draft proposals on how the hydro dams will be financed. Iron ore prices have been gathering steam in the past weeks as confidence over the outlook for China’s steel demand increases. Shares jumped 17.3 per cent, or 1.5p to 10.3p. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose 0.2 per cent, while the S&P 500 also ticked up 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the pound was trading at $1.276 against the dollar. Oil prices dropped around 1 per cent after sliding almost 2 per cent the previous day as major shipping firms began returning to the Red Sea. Danish company Maersk said it has scheduled container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and Red Sea. It had called a temporary halt this month following attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia. The move to reinstate the route has ‘helped dispel some immediate concerns about supply issues’, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. Shell’s share price dipped 0.3 per cent, or 7p, to 2,549p. BP’s stock dropped 0.4 per cent, or 2p, to 465p on lower oil prices. ‘The market is likely to try the upside again... maybe in the early new year, on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States,’ said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. UK housebuilder stocks fell on fears the Bank of England will be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. A cautious approach would keep mortgage costs higher for longer. Barratt Developments’ share price fell 0.7 per cent, or 4p, to 562.4p, Land Securities’ stock dropped 1 per cent, or 7.2p, to 716.4p and Berkeley tumbled 0.4 per cent, or 20p, to 4,737p. Streeter said: ‘Housebuilders are on the back foot amid signs that consumers are still showing signs of resilience in their spending patterns in the post-Christmas sales. ‘The Bank of England is showing more wariness than the Fed about the trajectory for inflation, so any sign that interest rates might stay higher for longer in the UK aren’t read well for the housing market.’ On London’s AIM market, the biggest faller was chipmaker Sondrel. Shares plunged 53.7 per cent after a £1.7million contract delay sparked cashflow issues.",

    "text": "'It's about living as usual': Sheboygan County will soon be home to 1st-of-its-kind dementia village in the US TOWN OF WILSON, Wis. (CBS 58) -- There are more than 120,000 people in Wisconsin who live with Alzheimer's disease. Now, a Sheboygan nonprofit is planning to build an innovative community in the Town of Wilson to support those with dementia. It's called \"Livasu Village\" which is short for \"living as usual.\" “What really came out of a grassroots efforts of dementia crisis response are we decided to look instead at preventing crisis,\" said Mary Pitsch, the co-founder of [Dementia Innovations](https://dementiainnovations.org/). “We’re really all about living as usual which sounds simple but in traditional care settings that’s really not the case.” The village, which sits on about 79 acres of land, will be a total of 124 homes in pocket neighborhoods anywhere from 10 to 14 homes, for owners with dementia. Support and care from trained staff will be available around the clock as needed and to the levels requested. The homes, which range from one-bedroom and one-bathroom to two-bedroom and two-bathroom, will surround community amenities like a gym, spa, theater, grocery store, chapel, and a restaurant which is open to the general public. “The village will allow them the opportunity and afford them the opportunity to live as usual as much as possible,\" Pitsch said. She added that allowing residents to maintain home ownership is also key when it comes to continuing control over their lives. \"Suddenly when we have dementia, we take away all of that control,\" Pitsch said. “People still need autonomy. People with dementia don’t want to lose themselves into only that diagnosis.” This is the first-of-its-kind in the United States. Pitsch and the rest of the team said they took inspiration from [Hogeweyk](https://hogeweyk.dementiavillage.com/), a similar concept in the Netherlands. “It’s so new it just really requires people to think outside the box. People want change but actually to do change is hard,\" Pitsch said. “We hear almost every day; I wish I had that for my parent.” Another stand out point for this design is that couples and families will be able to stay together -- unlike other more traditional care routes. \"It's just the idea of staying together. That's something that you don't want to give up,\" said Jim Holmes of Sheboygan. Holmes, who is also a board member for Dementia Innovations, lost his wife, Patti, to the disease. “That’s why I’m interested in this and that’s why I love doing what we’re doing because it’s in her memory,\" Holmes said. \"My wife went through 12 years of dementia.\" It was Patti's wish to stay at home through her final years. The two ended up moving to the area in 2011 to be closer to their children. \"What was best was we spent the rest of her life together, the way it should be,\" Holmes said. Now he's working to make sure others impacted can have the same opportunity. “She would’ve loved to be in one of the houses and been able to walk around and enjoy the other people or sit out on the porch and talk to the neighbors,\" Holmes said. \"They can do anything they want, whenever.\" Pitsch said the village will be open to the public and she hopes by doing so, it will reduce any stigma around the disease. \"They're just people that happen to have a diagnosis,\" Pitsch said. “We are the leaders in the United States right now and we do see this as a pilot project for others throughout the state and then throughout the United States as well.” Groundbreaking is set to start in the next few months, with an overall goal of moving residents in by fall of 2025.",
