    "text": "Portugal venceu o duelo inaugural da Liga das Nações diante da Croácia no Estádio da Luz por 2-1, num duelo que ficou marcado pelo golo 900 de Cristiano Ronaldo, mas também pela lesão de Vitinha. Roberto Martínez, em declarações à Sport TV, mostrou-se feliz com o trabalho demonstrado pela equipa e deixou elogios ao avançado português. Análise ao duelo: «A primeira parte foi brilhante, o que fizemos com bola abriu a Croácia, que tinha sempre linha de cinco. Tivemos padrões de ataque muito bem executados. Sofrer o golo deixa a equipa com sensação de ter de manter o resultado. A resposta foi que demos a bola à Croácia, mas a defender muito bem. Não foi um jogo brilhante, mas mostrou qualidade e a atitude, foco e trabalho em manter a baliza a salvo, com e sem bola. A função dos alas: «era importante que a Croácia tem muitos jogadores no meio-campo, mas é difícil marcar movimentos de rotura e o Dalot fez isso muito bem. A entrada de João Neves deu força ao meio-campo. É importante mostrar opções. Vitória importante que mostra o que podemos fazer quando mostramos todas as opções da equipa.» Jogo histórico para Cristiano: «É um momento histórico. 900 golos? É incrível. Ele também marca os 900 golos pelo compromisso que tem com a seleção. Tem muita energia para partilhar com os mais jovens no balneário. O compromisso dele é uma mais-valia para esta seleção. Fazer o golo no dia da homenagem ao Pepe é especial.» Estreia de Pote: «É um formato diferente. Na Liga das Nações, temos 72 horas entre jogos e temos de avaliar. O Vitinha vai estar fora e precisamos de estar frescos para os próximos jogos.»",

    "text": "We may not have our dream Kardashian garden, equipped with beds of tropical plants, a plush outdoor couch, or a firepit (how very Love Island villa!), but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy gardens just the same.\nIf you would rather not get out of your own garden, or if you don't have one at all, there is no need to worry. There are a plethora of beautiful public gardens across Ireland for you to visit and here are some of the best...\nKylemore Abbey, Galway\nKylemore Abbey is a fabulous spot located in the hills of Connemara. The Abbey itself was founded for Benedictine nuns who fled Belgium in World War 1. Here you will find a gorgeous Victorian walled garden.\nThere is also a large woodland walking trail and if you work up an appetite from all the walking, there is a tea house and a café to grab a bite to eat.\nA standard ticket will provide you access to all that the park has to offer, including a guided tour. An adult ticket costs €17.00 and kids under 12 go free. A family of four ticket costs €40.00. The garden is open seven days a week, from 10am to 6pm, with the last admission at 5pm.\nThe Irish National Stud's Japanese Gardens, Kildare\nThe\nJapanese Gardens are filled with flowers of every shade to transport you to another world. The gardens are part of the National Stud, which provides a rich history of Irish racing.\nIts museum is home to the skeleton of Arkle, regarded as one of the greatest horses to ever race. It truly is a wonderful experience.\nLike Kylemore, it opens from 9am to 6pm every day, with last admission at 5pm. Adult admission ranges from €17.00 to €19.00, while a child can enter from €9.00 to €11.00.\nEmo Court Gardens, Laois\nHome to a fabulous 18th-century house, Emo Court Gardens is the perfect place to spend your weekend, and what's more, they provide plenty of picnic benches so you can save on cash and bring a packed lunch from home.\nThe estate sprawls across 35 hectares of land so you can get a long walk in while being surrounded by towering trees and bright flower beds. It costs €8.00 to enter the park as an adult and children go in for €4.00. A family ticket is €20.00.\nMuckross House, Kerry\nThis gorgeous park, 6km outside of Killarney, was the first national park in the Republic of Ireland. Its summer opening hours stretch a little bit longer than other parks, opening at 9.15am until 7pm, with final admission at 5.40pm.\nIn true Killarney fashion, the park also provides a taste of Irish history in the form of tours of traditional farms from long-ago Ireland.\nA ticket to enter either the house or the farm costs €9.00 for adults and €6.00 for children, but you can also buy tickets for dual access.\nBantry House and Gardens, Cork\nThis historic house, overlooking Bantry Bay is owned by the White family, who have opened it to the public. Its lavish tea rooms offer afternoon tea, and you can even stay in the old mansion overnight!\nThe garden is equipped with seven terraces, with some overlooking the sea. An adult can enter for €14, while a child goes in for €5.\nKilkenny Park, Kilkenny\nThese stunning grounds, situated in the heart of\nKilkenny's bustling city, is home to an iconic castle. The park is free to enter and with a playground, an ice cream stand and plenty of picnic benches, what more could you wish for?\nThe park stretches out 50 acres and is full of wildlife, so you may see a squirrel or two. It stays open until 8:30pm during the summer, so it is perfect for an evening stroll!\nPowerscourt House and Gardens, Wicklow\nPowerscourt Gardens is one of the most glamorous in the country. Having been named as the third \"Best Garden in the World\" by National Geographic, it is a must-see!\nThere is an Avoca café located in the house, as well as a quaint gift shop, It also boasts being home to Ireland's largest waterfall.\nAn adult ticket will set you back €13.50 and kids go in for €5.00\nBloom Garden Festival will be in full swing this weekend, but there is no need to have garden envy! With all of the beautiful public gardens that the country has to offer, there is no excuse to sit inside this summer!\n* This article was originally published on\nEvoke.ie.",

    "text": "If you’re disappointed that you missed earlier northern lights displays —or lucky enough to have caught a few—this weekend could be another treat!\nA strong G4-level geomagnetic storm is expected from Oct. 10 to 12, which could create a stunning aurora borealis show across Canada, including parts of southern Ontario, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe Canadian Space Agency shared a post on social media noting that “auroras will likely be visible across Canada as night falls,” suggesting that dark-sky locations in southern Ontario, like conservation areas around Hamilton, Milton and along Lake Ontario, may provide the best views.\nFor the best chance to catch the northern lights, make sure skies are clear before heading out between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., for optimal viewing conditions across the GTA.\nHowever, Environment Canada predicts that Saturday and Sunday night skies are expected to be mostly overcast, which could obstruct the spectacular event.\nThis highly anticipated display follows an active season of auroras , with views reaching much farther south than usual in recent months, including last weekend.\nAs the solar cycle nears its peak between late 2024 and early 2025, more chances to see the northern lights may be on the horizon, if solar activity remains high.",

    "text": "La suerte de la Primitiva ha hecho parada en Avilés. Este jueves, un acertante de la ciudad ha conseguido un premio de 1.123.054 euros correspondientes a la primera categoría del sorteo de la Primitiva, es decir, con seis aciertos. El boleto premiado fue sellado en la administración de loterías número 3, ubicada en la Avenida Santa Apolonia. Los números de la suerte fueron 3, 48, 23, 11, 47 y 45. Además, el complementario es el 19 y el reintegro el 1. También se sacó el número del Joker, que fue el 6750664. El boleto sellado en Avilés fue el único de primera categoría, mientras que de la segunda categoría (cinco aciertos más el complementario), hubo cinco acertantes en Barcelona, Bilbao, Murcia, Sevilla y Alaquàs (Valencia). ¿Cómo se juega a la Primitiva? Para participar en la Primitiva se seleccionan 6 números diferentes de una tabla de entre el 1 al 49; el objetivo es acertar la combinación ganadora en el sorteo correspondiente de jueves o sábado, formada por 6 bolas de las 49 que se extraen del bombo, que comúnmente se conoce como el 6/49. La apuesta simple cuesta un euro y pueden acumularse hasta ocho apuestas por boleto, eligiendo los 6 números en cada apuesta. La apuesta múltiple permite jugar hasta once números por apuesta. A mayor número de múltiples mayor será tu apuesta y tus posibilidades de ganar. También se extrae una bola extra como número complementario, y otra bola de un bombo aparte, entre el 0 y el 9, que hace de número de reintegro. Para ganar el mayor premio hay que acertar los 6 números más el reintegro. Se puede jugar para un solo sorteo (sorteo diario) o para los dos sorteos de la semana (sorteo semanal). Con esta última opción se juega jueves y sábado, habiendo validado la apuesta antes del sorteo del jueves. Tendrás premio si aciertas al menos 3 números. Los sorteos tienen lugar los jueves y sábados a las 21:30 horas.",

    "title": "Mass Bhagavad Gita recitation: Trinamool accuses BJP of 'garnering Hindu votes' through event - India Today",
    "text": "West Bengal minister and TMC leader Udayan Guha on Sunday criticised a Gita recitation event in Kolkata's historical Brigade Parade Ground, saying that the event was \"political\" and the BJP was trying to garner Hindu votes through it. Notably, the BJP has denied this claim, saying that three apolitical organisations had planned the event.\"They are trying to garner more Hindu votes. People of India, especially Bengali people, do not like this politics,\" Guha said.The TMC leader added that it would have been more beneficial for young people if a sports event was held instead of a Gita recitation event.The gathering, which saw one lakh participants chanting from Bhagavad Gita in Kolkata, was organised by the \"Ek Lokho Konthe Geeta Path\" committee, an association of three organisations.The event, which was not officially a BJP program, saw the participation of several prominent BJP leaders from Bengal, including Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari, State BJP president Sukanta Majumder, MP Dilip Ghosh, and Locket Chaterjee. Another TMC leader, Shashi Panja, criticised the BJP's involvement in the event, suggesting that the party was showing disrespect to Bengal's icons like Swami Vivekananda by misinterpreting his teachings on the importance of physical activity over spiritual study.“Swami Vivekananda once said that you will be nearer to heaven if you play football rather than study Gita. Today, what did we see? Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar showed disrespect to Swami Vivekananda's thoughts and his sayings,\" Panja said.The Bengal BJP president refuted allegations by the TMC leaders, saying \"This is not a program of the BJP. Three different organisations have come together for this. This is the cultural heritage of India as well as Bengal.\"CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONSBJP National Secretary Anupam Hazra on Sunday raised concerns over allegations made by a Facebook user about tickets for the recitation event being sold for Rs 1000.Taking to Facebook, Hazra shared a Facebook post by a man named Anil Singh who said that VIP passes for the Gita recitation event were being sold for Rs 1000 by BJP workers in Nalhati.\"If this is true, then it is fatal! Corruption even in recitation of Gita, are Hindus at all?\" wrote Hazra in another Facebook post, calling for a probe into the matter. He had tagged the Home Minister, Prime Minister and BJP president in his social media post.Notably, ahead of the event today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his best wishes to the \"Lokkhe Konthe Gita Path\" gathering. He expressed optimism that the collective recitation of the Bhagavad Gita by a diverse gathering would not only foster social harmony but also inject energy into the nation's development journey. Although Modi was expected to attend the event today, he could not make it.Published By: Aditi SharmaPublished On: Dec 24, 2023ALSO READ | When 50% of people in Bengal will speak Urdu...: Kolkata Mayor's remark stirs rowMust Watch",

    "text": "ATLÁNTIDA, HONDURAS.- Fuertes inundaciones se registran este jueves -28 de diciembre- en varios sectores de la ciudad de La Ceiba, en el departamento de Atlántida, zona norte de Honduras, debido al ingreso del [frente frío](https://www.elheraldo.hn/honduras/frente-frio-honduras-diciembre-fiestas-fin-ano-2023-MD16739984) que ya deja lluvias en la región. Según denunciaron los mismos vecinos, estas inundaciones se deben a las crecidas de quebradas cercanas al lugar. Según las imágenes compartidas por residentes, las viviendas que se encuentran en la ciudad se encuentran con el agua hasta el suelo, por lo que se pide precaución a los pobladores. Asimismo, se observa que algunos vehículos queden varados por las calles intransitables, producto de la inundación. Hasta el momento se desconocen la cantidad de daños o personas lesionadas por las fuertes inundaciones. Asimismo, se reporta suspensión de energía eléctrica, luego de fuertes lluvias, se reporta falla en la línea de transmisión en el departamento de Atlántida, por lo que varios sectores se encuentran sin servicio eléctrico. Atlántida y seis departamentos en alerta verde Debido al ingreso de un frente frío y una vaguada al territorio hondureño que dejará fuertes lluvias y bajas temperaturas, la Secretaría de Gestión de Riesgos y Contigencias Nacionales (Copeco) emitió esta tarde alerta verde en siete departamentos del país. Y nuevamente sería la zona norte de Honduras la más afectada. Los departamentos declarados en alerta son: Islas de la Bahía, Santa Bárbara, Yoro, Atlántida, Cortés, Colón y Gracias a Dios. Estas alertas fueron emitidas por un período de 72 horas a partir de hoy jueves desde las 12 del mediodía. Según explicó Copeco, las fuertes lluvias que comenzaron ayer provocaría “posibles inundaciones urbanas y desbordamientos de los ríos que nacen en las sierras de Omoa, Merendón, Mico Quemado, Nombre de Dios, La Esperanza y Sico, así como alto oleaje en la costa norte del país”. Los mayores acumulados se registrarían en las montañas del norte y noroccidente con acumulados de hasta 200 a 250 milímetros (mm) diarios los días viernes y sábado y se advierte de vientos racheados que podrían alcanzar los 60 kilómetros por hora sobre las planicies del sur. Este es el sexto frente frío de la temporada 2023-2024 y aún quedan en proyecciones al menos 8 de estos fenómenos climatológicos. Los frentes fríos anteriores dejaron grandes disturbios y muertes en la zona norte de Honduras. Este artículo se firma bajo el anonimato para proteger a sus autores",
