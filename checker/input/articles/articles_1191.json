    "text": "India Women suffer crushing defeat against Australia Australia got over the line with 21 balls and six wickets to spare with none of the Indian bowlers able to make any impact MUMBAI: India Women succumbed to their sixth consecutive defeat and eighth in a row at home despite recording the highest-ever ODI total against Australia, as the visitor registered a commanding six-wicket win in the first match here on Thursday. Phoebe Litchfield (78) and Ellyse Perry (75) anchored the chase with a resolute 148-run stand for the second wicket as Australia replied with 285/4 in 46.3 overs to overhaul India’s 282/8 and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. As Phoebe and Ellyse fell in quick succession, Beth Mooney (42 from 47 balls, 4x4s) and Tahlia McGrath (68 not out, 55 balls, 11x4s) flattened India with their 88-run stand for the fourth wicket off only 67 balls. Australia got over the line with 21 balls and six wickets to spare with none of the Indian bowlers able to make any impact. India made a perfect start by dealing an early blow to Australia, which lost Alyssa Healy (0) in the first over when Sneh Rana flew to her left to take an acrobatic catch off Renuka Singh. But India could not capitalise further on the initial success as Australia ran away with the game, aided by some ordinary effort in the field from the host. For that matter, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur’s ‘golden’ arm could also not come to the rescue of the side on a placid wicket as she conceded 32 runs in three overs without a wicket. Ellyse notched up her fifth fifty against India and 33rd overall while Phoebe bounced back strongly from a poor outing in her one-off Test last week to flay the Indian attack. Ellyse and Phoebe’s 148-run association is now the third highest second-wicket partnership against India in ODIs. But both the batters only had themselves to blame for their respective dismissals. After clobbering nine fours and two sixes, Ellyse danced down the track to hit one straight to Pooja Vastrakar off Deepti Sharma (1/55) at long-on, having suffered cramps as her innings progressed. On the other hand, Phoebe produced 78 runs from 89 balls with eight fours and a six in which her reverse sweep shots were the highlight. Phoebe fell soon after Ellyse when she missed connecting on a sweep shot off Sneh Rana in the 31st over. Earlier, a fine 82 from Jemimah Rodrigues and a brisk unbeaten 62 from Pooja Vastrakar propelled India Women to their highest ODI total of 282/8. India’s previous-best against Australia in ODIs was 281/4 at Derby in 2017. BRIEF SCORES: India 282/8 in 50 overs (J Rodrigues 82, P Vastrakar 62, Y Bhatia 49) lost to Australia 285/4 in 46.3 overs (P Litchfield 78, E Perry 75, T McGrath 68*, B Mooney 42)",

    "title": "Some environmental groups concerns about Palisades plants",
    "text": "Environmental groups are voicing concerns about plans to build the nation’s first small modular reactors, or SMRs, at the Palisades nuclear power plant in Van Buren County.\nHoltec International says it aims to revive Palisades later this year after it was decommissioned in 2022. In five years, the goal is to install the nation’s first SMRs there. Critics warn the reactors would still produce radioactive waste without long-term disposal solutions and pose accident risks.\nMichael Keegan with the grassroots group, “Don’t Waste Michigan,” says about 80 companies are competing to market their SMRs, which he says aren’t really small modular reactors.\n“A colleague of mine refers to them as small mythical reactors because they don’t exist,” Keegan said. “They’re PowerPoint reactors. It’s hyperbole. And they’re all chasing Department of Energy money. We’re talking billions of dollars.”\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission has formed a panel to oversee the Palisades restart for safety compliance. Keegan says anyone who wants to challenge the project must do so under the Administrative Procedures Act. He’s hoping the opposition will eventually get to take the issue of Palisades to federal court.\nThe plant is expected to eventually generate 800 megawatts and power 800,000 homes while providing around 600 jobs in Southwest Michigan.",

    "text": "Hamas aceita proposta de cessar-fogo do Egito e Catar O Hamas anunciou esta segunda-feira que aceitou a proposta de cessar-fogo apresentada pelo Egito e pelo Catar, mediadores nas negociações para uma trégua na guerra entre esse grupo radical e Israel. Telavive já avançou, porém, que essa proposta é para si \"inaceitável\". Segundo o Hamas, o chefe do grupo, Ismail Haniyeh, já informou o primeiro-ministro do Catar e o chefe dos serviços de inteligência egípcios que aceitou a proposta. \"Ismail Haniyeh, chefe do gabinete político do Hamas, falou por telefone com o primeiro-ministro do Catar, o xeque Mohammed bin Abdelrahmane Al Thani, e com o ministro egípcio dos Serviços Secretos, Abbas Kamel, e informou-os que o Hamas aprovou a sua proposta de acordo de cessar-fogo\", refere um comunicado do grupo. À agência France Press, um responsável do Hamas declarou que \"a bola está agora no campo de Israel, que tem de optar entre aceitar o acordo de cessar-fogo ou bloqueá-lo\". Israel decidiu, entretanto, que a proposta aprovada pelo Hamas não é aceitável, segundo um funcionário israelita ouvido pela agência Reuters. De acordo com a mesma fonte, o acordo inclui conclusões a “longo prazo” que Israel não pode apoiar. “Isto parece ser um estratagema destinado a fazer com que Israel pareça ser o lado que recusa um acordo”. Alguns órgãos de comunicação social israelitas também referem que o Governo de Benjamin Netanyahu não aceitou o acordo. Alguns órgãos de comunicação social israelitas também referem que o Governo de Benjamin Netanyahu não aceitou o acordo. Segundo o Hamas, a proposta inclui várias exigências, nomeadamente um cessar-fogo, a reconstrução de Gaza, o regresso de pessoas deslocadas e uma troca de reféns israelitas por prisioneiros palestinianos. O presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saudou a aprovação do acordo pelo Hamas e disse esperar que Israel faça o mesmo. Um responsável do Hamas disse ainda à Reuters que uma delegação do grupo radical vai em breve visitar o Cairo para discutir o acordo de cessar-fogo e o próximo passo a tomar. Há vários meses que Egito e Catar têm mediado conversações entre Israel e o Hamas, procurando encontrar uma solução para a guerra desencadeada pelo ataque do movimento islamita em território israelita, em 7 de outubro passado.",
