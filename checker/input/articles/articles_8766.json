    "title": "'Too Good to be True': Mobile App Brings On-Demand Transit to Quebec Communities - The Energy Mix",
    "text": "April 30, 2023: A mobile app is bringing transit on demand to a regional county municipality in west Quebec that has spent years looking for better, more convenient mobility to and from the Ottawa-Gatineau area nearby.\n“When community members first hear about the service, they think it must be too good to be true,”\nsays Laura Schnurr, director of climate transitions at the Tamarack Institute, citing Chelsea Councillor and local climate champion Rita Jain.\n- Be among the first to read\nThe Energy Mix Weekender\n- A brand new weekly digest containing exclusive and essential climate stories from around the world.\n- The Weekender:The climate news you need.\nFor just $4.75 per ride, people in Les Collines-de-l’Outaouais, population about 50,000, “can take advantage of flexible schedules and routes to travel nearly anywhere in the region at a time that suits them,” Schnurr writes in a recent blog post. Transcollines on Demand launched as a pilot late last year with funding from the province, four local municipalities, and user fees, and ridership has increased from 346 trips in November to 2,042 in February.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the public transit system in Les-Collines-de-l’Outaouais catered almost exclusively to public servants and other commuters headed to Gatineau and Ottawa in the morning, then returning home at night, Schnurr explains. But it wasn’t nearly a perfect system. Buses sometimes ran empty, and non-commuters like teens and seniors couldn’t get transit when they needed it.\nThen when the pandemic hit, “the buses became barren and only offering fixed routes was no longer viable,” she recalls. “Today, commuters have begun returning to offices in town, but often only some of the time given the shift to more flexible work arrangements.”\nWith the new system, passengers use the mobile app to book their rides at least two hours ahead. The app suggests the nearest pick-up and drop-off locations and combines trips with similar itineraries.\nAfter surveys showed 89% user satisfaction with the pilot, the Transcollines Board voted April 18 to make the temporary offering permanent. The system is expected to shift over to electric vehicles in the near future, and Transcollines also plans to shift some of its bus fleet to on-demand rides in the course of this year.\n“As more residents become aware of the service and start using it, the social, environmental, and economic benefits will continue to grow,” Schnurr writes, adding that the same model could work well for other rural and semi-rural municipalities. Jain said she hoped the on-demand system would encourage people in the region to leave their second cars, or even their primary vehicles, at home.",

The agreement, signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, came after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government, officials said. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel The peace pact is expected to end decades old insurgency in Assam. However, the hardline faction of the ULFA headed by Paresh Baruah is not part of the agreement. Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border. The ULFA was formed in 1979 with the demand for a \"sovereign Assam\". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990. The Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between it and central and state governments.

    "text": "Sui Network experienced a two-hour downtime as preliminary investigation links it to “DOS due to integer overflow.” At press time, the network was fully operational after a v1.37.4 patch was deployed by the Sui team. The Sui Network suffered a two-hour downtime today after its status page confirmed that its validators were down. However, neither the Mysten Labs nor the Sui Foundation has provided any detailed report.\nService Announcement: The Sui network is currently experiencing an outage and not processing transactions. We’ve identified the issue and a fix will be deployed shortly. We appreciate your patience and will continue to provide updates.\nWhat Happened According to our information, the network failed to produce a new block for two hours, disrupting major operations and bringing its blockchain to a standstill. For Sui Explorer, the issue occurred around 9:15 am UTC.\nA preliminary investigation shows that the outage was caused by “DOS due to integer overflow.” Later, the ExVul team shared a GitHub link that contained a patch code to salvage the situation.\n🚨🚨🚨 @suinetwork node shutdown almost 1h30mins, because it occur a DOS bug,\nAfter our analysis, it was found that the @SuiNetwork node occur DOS due to integer overflow. The location of the bug : https://t.co/QtijLcmTXd and the fix patch code: https://t.co/7Mm8IuDcis — ExVul (@EXVULSEC) November 21, 2024\nAfter this, the Sui team announced that it had deployed a v1.37.4 patch, making the network operational at press time.\nThe Sui network is back up and processing transactions again, thanks to swift work from the incredible community of Sui validators. The 2-hour downtime was caused by a bug in transaction scheduling logic that caused validators to crash, which has now been resolved.\nResearching its past outages, we discovered that the network was hit by a major outage at the public remote procedure call (RPC) node level in July 2024. However, the team immediately resolved this challenge. Earlier this month, it also encountered another challenge that prevented it from accepting new user transactions. Also, this was later resolved. Meanwhile, the most recent outage is the first to be encountered since the mainnet launch in May 2023.\nFollowing this announcement, SUI’s price recorded a 3% fall on its 24-hour chart, positioning its price at $3.5. However, its seven-day return was still positive as it surged by 6.9% within the period.\nSui and One Championship Partnership Before this unexpected outage, Sui announced that it had collaborated with the world’s largest martial arts organization, ONE Championship (ONE), by becoming its official blockchain partner. According to our earlier report , the collaboration ensures that the mobile game leverages Sui’s technology to provide true digital ownership at its core.\nCommenting on this, Head of Ecosystem Development at Sui Foundation Jameel Khalfan disclosed that:\nONE Championship is the fastest-growing major global sports property and has established a reputation for being extremely forward-thinking and technologically innovative. Being chosen as their official blockchain partner and being integrated into their tech stack is a validation of Sui’s growth and adoption trajectory and another opportunity to serve the sports community with Sui’s technology.\nSui has also partnered with Google Cloud to provide developers with real-time blockchain data access. This collaboration was to enable developers to capitalize on Sui’s blockchain data via Google Cloud’s Pub/Sub service.",

    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Idahoans who have not received a flu vaccine this season are urged to do so now, as increasing numbers of influenza cases and high positivity rates are detected at Primary Health clinics across the Treasure Valley. “We saw about 300 cases of influenza in our clinics last week, and cases this week are trending higher,” said Ann Weiss, M.D., Clinical Director for Primary Health Medical Group. “This year’s flu vaccine is estimated to be a fairly good match, and while we won’t have final efficacy numbers until after the season, it isn’t too late to get vaccinated now.” Flu vaccine is available on a walk-in basis at all Primary Health Urgent Care clinics, including high-dose vaccine for patients 65 and older. There is no cost with most major insurance plans, and a discount is available for self-pay patients. Patients who are feeling ill and need to be evaluated for flu can walk in, or book their urgent care visit ahead of time for a shorter wait at [www.PrimaryHealth.com [primaryhealth.com]](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.PrimaryHealth.com__;!!FJkDyvWmnr4!fzF7u8c3siR2AUmiJ23qjmfrNc0lPDBjvP_NbEf6qL19kBApWoCV6bS8oHGtWRLp9nEwKDvx0t-8S4p2l2YNPo03sA$).
