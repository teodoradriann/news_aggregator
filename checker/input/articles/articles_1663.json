    "title": "Francis Ford Coppola shares “The Outsiders” audition footage, with young Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, and more",
    "text": "The audition process for the 1983 film asked each actor to read lines for every role.\nFrancis Ford Coppola is celebrating The Outsiders with an adorable blast from Hollywood’s past.\nMore than 40 years after its release, the 1983 adaptation of S.E. Hinton’s classic novel remains highly regarded, in part because of the many young cast members who would go on to achieve major success. In honor of those star-making performances, the film’s director shared footage of the auditions that started it all — including the likes of Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, and Rob Lowe.\n“42 years ago we cast The Outsiders in a unique way,” Coppola wrote in an Instagram post Wednesday. “We had all the actors together on a soundstage and would alternate different actors reading for different roles.”\nHe continued: “It was interesting because each of them was watching their competition, so while it could’ve been a volatile situation, it turned into a very positive one. There emerged the natural respect and sense of colleagueship among them. The result worked beautifully and reminded me of my days as a camp counselor.”\nAs promised, the footage features the actors reading the parts of various characters from the coming-of-age story, including roles they wouldn’t go on to play. Anthony Michael Hall appears in one audition tape, reading for the role of main character Ponyboy — ultimately, it was C. Thomas Howell who booked the part.\nA few of the stars chimed in with comments on Coppola’s post, reminiscing about the experience. “The people that came to these auditions… so many went on to have great careers,” Howell wrote. “Amazing.”\n“These auditions and this film experience still inform me today,” Macchio wrote, thanking the Oscar-winning filmmaker, while Lowe added, “Feels like this was just yesterday!”\nEverett Collection Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, and Tom Cruise in ‘The Outsiders’\nThe film, like the novel, revolves around rival teen gangs in a rural Oklahoma town: the poor Greasers and the wealthy Socs. After Ponyboy and Johnny (Macchio) get into a deadly brawl, they’re forced to go into hiding as both gangs come to terms with the consequences of their violent lives.\nThe Outsiders stars previously spoke of the intense audition process, filled to the brim with up-and-coming talent, while reflecting on the experience for EW’s 2021 oral history of the movie.\n“Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Dennis Quaid, Mickey Rourke… it was a movie everybody wanted to be in,” Macchio recalled. “Leif Garrett was probably the most famous guy who walked in.”\nGarrett, who eventually landed the role of Bob Sheldon, remarked, “It was all day long, and it was a process of elimination. I really wanted to be Ponyboy, because that’s the role. But I wasn’t right for it. I’m not that greasy.”\nCoppola concluded, “It was competitive. But it only spurred them on.”\nFootage of the auditions was also included as bonus material in previous home-video releases. You can watch the clips shared by Coppola above.\nWant more movie news?

    "title": "IAM rejects Boeing contract, strikes at midnight",
    "text": "Subscription Required\nBy Karl Sinclair\nSept. 12, 2024, © Leeham News: Boeing's largest union today rejected a four-year contract and approved a walk-out beginning at midnight tonight.\nThe vote to reject the contract and go on strike were overwhelming: 94.6% to reject the contract, 96% for the strike.\nFor financially ailing Boeing, a strike is the last thing it needs. When the union, IAM 751, last struck in 2008, the walk-out lasted 57 days and set the foundation for labor wars that continued to this day. Then-CEO Jim McNerney the following year located the second 787 assembly line in South Carolina. (The first line, in Everett, was closed during the COVID pandemic.) In 2011, McNerney threatened to build the 737 MAX elsewhere if 751 members didn't approve a contract amendment with concessions. He repeated the process in 2013 and 2014 with the 777X development. The latter was the second amendment to the 2008 labor contract that governed wages and benefits for the huge union, which represents workers at Boeing’s factories in Renton and Everett, home to the 737 and 767/KC-46A and 777, respectively. The IAM 751 also represents workers at other Boeing locations.\nUnion leadership want to recover benefit concessions and sharply increase wages that failed to keep up with inflation. They wanted a guarantee that the next Boeing airplane will be assembled in Puget Sound (the greater Seattle area). They wanted a seat on the Board of Directors and a role in changing Boeing’s failed safety culture.\nManagement wanted to hold the line. The company remains in a loss-making position, led by the continuing turmoil at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The defense unit, which is not represented by 751, also is bleeding profits. The two units caused Boeing to burn through nearly $10bn in cash in the first half of this year alone. Only the services unit is making money, but not nearly enough to offset the losses and negative cash flows at the other two units.\nMore losses and negative cash flow is expected for the quarter ending this month. Company CFO Brian West speaks at a Morgan Stanley investors conference tomorrow. His will be the first detailed response to the union vote, whatever the outcome.\nInternally, Boeing prepared for a 2-12 week strike.\nSome observers fear that a long strike could shove Boeing into bankruptcy. LNA doesn’t agree, but we’ve nevertheless analyzed the prospect.",

These educators, who actively support programmes like SSIP, Vibrant Gujarat, Semicon, G20 summits, hackathons and Skill India, say they find the inordinate wait frustrating. Following a govt resolution in March 2024 regarding CAS benefits for appointments made after Jan 1, 2016, the Commissionerate of Technical Education (CTE) sought applications through the Kozent portal in Aug 2024. Although 80% of applications have been reviewed, various administrative and procedural challenges prevent the issuance of AGP orders.Former govt polytechnic faculty, who joined the engineering colleges through Gujarat Public Service Commission recruitments, face AGP denial due to their previous service being unrecognized. Furthermore, faculty members obtaining PhD qualifications after their initial AGP (Rs 6,000-7,000) have not received the one-year relaxation stipulated in AICTE's Jan 2016 guidelines for AGP progression to Rs 8,000.Faculty members who earned additional qualifications after their appointments and filed post-facto NOC applications in Jan 2025 remain in limbo. Additionally, those who have previous adhoc or regular service experience face delays in pay protection, pending verification from the Pay Verification Unit (PVU), Gandhinagar.Teaching staff associations have requested the education department and the CTE to address the pending cases by July 31, indicating possible statewide demonstrations if their concerns remain unaddressed.",

    "title": "Movie review: ‘Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead’ a surprisingly fun remake",
    "text": "Katie Walsh | Tribune News Service (TNS)\nThe hazards of remaking a beloved film are well known. While the 1991 comedy “Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead,” starring Christina Applegate, didn’t exactly thrill critics 30 years ago, it’s become a cult classic, especially for elder millennials who grew up on the movie. It’s the ideal text for a remake — the source material isn’t regarded as untouchable, the name recognition is high, and it can be easily adaptable to a modern milieu while still stoking those childhood memories for those who love the original.\nRelated Articles Movies | Michael Douglas has a knack for unforgettable roles — here are 7 of the best Movies | ‘Irena’s Vow’ review: Drama a powerful portrait of bravery during World War II Movies | ‘The Beast’ review: In 2044, AI takes care of business, while Léa Seydoux takes care of the movie Movies | What to watch: Unsettling ‘Civil War’ is the ultimate what-if movie Movies | ‘The Greatest Hits’ review: Time travel-by-song hook is catchy in fantasy-romance Nostalgia can be a trap, one that writer Chuck Hayward and director Wade Allain-Marcus fortunately sidestep in their remake. There are enough nods to the first film to please fans looking for those Easter eggs, but they don’t get in the way of the story itself, a teen comedy that keeps it real, despite the heightened circumstances. They also update the family from white to Black, which brings a new layer of stakes to the situation.\nAfter their mother (Patricia “Ms. Pat” Williams) suffers a nervous breakdown at work, the Crandell siblings are left in the care of a Mrs. Sturak (June Squibb), a sweet old lady who reveals herself to be a nagging, racist, slut-shaming tyrant. In her advanced age, the wild rager that the kids throw in the house is too much for her to bear, and she (as the title suggests) drops dead from shock, or perhaps secondhand smoke. Hoping to evade authorities, the Crandell siblings get rid of her body — along with her purse filled with cash from mom.\nWithout wanting to disturb their mentally fragile mother, shipped off to a meditation retreat in Thailand, it’s up to big sis Tanya (Simone Joy Jones) to get a big-girl job and provide for her siblings. So much for a fun summer, she’s now learning the joys of a Los Angeles morning commute and cutthroat office politics at a fashion company called Libra. Meanwhile, her skater brother Kenny (Donielle T. Hansley Jr.) has to get his slacker act together to hold down the fort at home.\nMuch of the appeal of the first film came from star Applegate in her first major film role (she was already well-known thanks to the sitcom “Married… With Children”), playing eldest sister Sue Ellen. Jones is similarly charming, in a different way. She sells a performance of a likable teen who is in over her head but gamely manages to thrive in a professional working environment.\nThe script by Hayward is not exactly breaking new ground (it is a remake after all) but it establishes the siblings as unique and distinctive characters, including smart and weird little bro Zack (Carter Young) and morbid gamer tween sis Melissa (Ayaamii Sledge). Their interactions are funny and natural, and their healthy skepticism of the police has real consequences and informs their questionable decision-making.\nThe only weak link in the family is Williams, a stand-up comedian whose small, underwritten role as mom to the Crandell kids doesn’t play to her strengths. She’s in a handful of scenes, and Tanya’s role model is filled by Nicole Richie playing her boss at Libra, Rose. Richie is so dynamic and energizing on screen you wonder why she doesn’t act more, and she has genuine chemistry with Jones.\nThis is the first major feature film directed by Allain-Marcus, an actor who co-starred on “Insecure,” and he does a lot to demonstrate his abilities and influences as a director here. The cinematography by Matt Clegg is crisp and saturated, utilizing a lot of complex tracking shots, and there are nods to ‘70s-style filmmaking and retro touches like the yellow title font that drops about 18 minutes into the film. Some of these flourishes are slightly inconsistent with the material, but demonstrate a new filmmaker excited to experiment with the form of the teen comedy.\n“Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead” is surprisingly authentic and fun for this kind of nostalgia-baiting remake material, which is naturally formulaic. It’s the focus on character and allowing the actors to shine that makes this one sing, and it should make a star out of Jones, who, like her character, manages to hold it all together.\n‘DON’T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER’S DEAD’ 2.5 stars (out of 4)\nMPA rating : R (for teen drug use, language and some sexual references)\nRunning time : 1:38\nHow to watch : In theaters now\n©2024 Tribune Content Agency, LLC",
