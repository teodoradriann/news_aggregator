    "text": "Chinese police have issued warnings to short video app operator Kuaishou Technology over alleged lapses in content moderation and protecting minors, according to a notice from local authorities.\\nThe Beijing-based video platform was called out for missteps that authorities say violate the country’s Cybersecurity Law, including failing to “deal in a timely manner with information prohibited by local laws from being published or transmitted” and inadequate protection of children on its platform, according to a notice published to the WeChat account of the National Cybersecurity Information Centre.\\n“The Public Security Administration … ordered [Kuaishou] to fully implement youth protection, comprehensively investigate and clean up illegal information, and remove illegal accounts,” the Cybersecurity Centre said in the notice.\\nKuaishou did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours on Friday.\\nThe administrative penalty comes as Beijing has been seeking greater control over the digital lives of the younger users. In August 2023, the country’s top internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), proposed a draft rule aimed at curbing internet addiction and fostering socialist values among minors.\\nThe agency said at the time that the rules were drafted to “improve the positive role of the internet, create a favourable network environment, prevent and intervene in minors’ internet addiction problems, and guide minors to form good internet use habits”.\\nThe rule went into effect on November 15, according to a post published to the official CAC website.\\nThe finalised rule “encourages and supports mobile terminals, apps and app distributors to join hands in building a Minor Mode” – technical controls that limit total time spent online daily, filter out inappropriate content, and prioritise the display of age-appropriate material to protect the users under the age of 18.\\nChina’s efforts to battle internet and video gaming addiction go back years. In 2019, the National Press and Publication Administration introduced measures that include real-name registration and limiting gameplay time to ensure minors do not binge on mobile games. Those rules were tightened in 2021, when the regulator limited minors to playing games for just three hours per week.\\n",

    "text": "(WXMI) — People along the East Coast are still trying to contend with the damage left by Hurricane Helene. A West Michigan company sent workers to South Carolina to help them pick up the pieces. FOX 17 connected with two B’s Trees employees, who say they received a call Wednesday to head down and lend a hand. We’re told many tree- and debris-removal companies in South Carolina left for Florida during the lead-up to Hurricane Milton this week. It’s partly why the local workers were asked to help. The damage from Hurricane Helene is still substantial despite having been two weeks since the storm. \"The damage is extensive to the point that right now we're in the initial recovery process just to return house lives to normal. If you looked out at the street, you would see that their logs piled up, brush piled up… absolutely everywhere is just completely clobbered,\" says Matthew Bossche. \"Houses have logs on them,” says Craig Wolff. “Trees are in backyards, pools, driveways, everywhere, and he just needed more manpower.\" Matthew and Craig say they will stay in South Carolina over the next seven days, helping clean up from sunrise to sunset.

    "text": "All News Featured 3 Middle East Other News Al-Jazeera: Hamas accepts ceasefire proposal May 6, 2024 | 7:41 PM May 7, 2024 | 10:38 AM 0 Shafaqna English- Hamas’s Leader Ismail Haniyeh has sent word of the group’s acceptance of a ceasefire proposal to Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\nA leading Hamas source tells Al-Jazeera that the group has informed Egyptian and Qatari mediators of its agreement with a ceasefire proposal.\nHamas’s statement on ceasefire in full “The mujahid brother Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas movement’s political bureau, had a phone call with the Qatari Prime Minister Al-Thani, and with the Egyptian Minister of Intelligence, Abbas Kamel, and informed them of the Hamas movement’s approval of their proposal regarding the ceasefire agreement.”\nA Hamas official has said that the “ball [is] now in Israel’s court”, and that’s where this proposed ceasefire now stands, with no response yet from the Israeli government.\nReport: Israeli official indicates rejection of ceasefire proposal An unnamed Israeli official quoted by the Reuters news agency says Hamas has approved a “softened” Egyptian proposal that is not acceptable to Israel.\nThe official added that the proposal included “far-reaching” conclusions that Israel will not support.\nIsraeli media outlets are also reporting that the Israeli government has not accepted the deal.\nReport: Israel studying Hamas ceasefire response Israel’s Channel 12 is reporting that the Israeli negotiating team has Hamas’s response from mediators, is studying it, and will issue an official response.\nCeasefire proposal includes three phases, including permanent ceasefire Sources have told Al Jazeera that the Egyptian-Qatari proposal Hamas has agreed to would include three phases, with each lasting 42 days. A truce would begin in the first phase, along with an Israeli withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor that Israel uses to divide northern and southern Gaza.\nA second phase would include the approval of a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The proposal also includes a provision approving an end to the blockade of Gaza in the third phase.\nHuge decision for Israel Former Israeli diplomat Alon Liel has spoken to Al Jazeera about the situation Israel’s government and Netanyahu are finding themselves in after Hamas’s announcement. “There is strong pressure from inside Israel on the government to go to Rafah, so I think the Israeli government faces a dilemma to go with the world or to go with the Israelis, to keep the government or to keep our international contacts,” he said.\n“It’s a huge decision for Israel, really huge,” Liel added, noting that even if there is a deal, many people in Israel “will be frightened that we lost the war or that Hamas stays in Gaza”. He went on to say: “If he [Netanyahu] accepts a deal, it might be the end of his political career.\nIsraeli Minister: Continue with ‘complete defeat’ of Hamas Israel’s far-right Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has responded to Hamas’s agreement to a truce proposal. He says the group is playing “games” that have only “one answer, an immediate order to occupy Rafah!” “Increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete defeat of Hamas, until its complete defeat,” he added in a social media post.\nUSA opposes Rafah invasion, regardless of Hamas’s ceasefire response The US Department of State’s Matthew Miller reasserted USA’s opposition to an Israeli assault on Rafah, which he said is separate from the push for a ceasefire.\n“We cannot support an operation in Rafah as it is currently envisioned,” he said, adding that the USA has not seen a credible plan to protect the 1.5 million civilians trapped in the city.\n“Even absent this latest response [by Hamas], we have made clear that we do not support Israel launching a full-scale military operation in Rafah.” Miller also expressed concern over Israel’s order to evacuate residents of eastern Rafah.\nSources: ALJazeera\nwww.shafaqna.com",

    "text": "Local elected officials and Con Edison representatives gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the launch of the energy company’s billion-dollar clean energy project in Southeast Queens.\nCon Edison Chairman and CEO Tim Cawley, joined by Vice President LaAsia Hundley, Assembly Member Clyde Vanel, Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr., and MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber, participated in the event at the project site located at 109-48 180th St. on Monday, Oct. 1.\nThe $1.2 billion initiative will modernize the electric grid in Southeast Queens by constructing two new substations and establishing a new Springfield electric network to support the area’s growing energy needs. The project, known as the Reliable Clean City-Idlewild Project, aims to deliver clean energy to homes, businesses, and major transportation hubs in the region.\nThe project will support the electrification of JFK Airport, the MTA’s transition to electric buses, and the electrification of buildings in Jamaica, Queens. It is expected to generate over 400 skilled union jobs, facilitate contracts for Minority and Women-Owned Businesses (MWBE), and contribute to New York State’s climate goals. The Reliable Clean City-Idlewild Project is one of two substations being built to enhance the electric grid in Southeast Queens.\nPhotographed on Sept. 16th, 2024, the Idlewild Project is a $1.2 billion investment to modernize the electric grid in Southeast Queens by creating two new substations and a new Springfield electric network to meet the growth in demand in the area. Photo by Willie Davis/Con Edison Many city officials and stakeholders released statements voicing support for the new energy project.\nCawle explained that the Reliable Clean City-Idlewild project represents a significant milestone in the company’s strategy to complete a clean energy future for New Yorkers. “We’re proud to break ground on this project that will enable the electrification for downtown Jamaica, JFK International Airport, and the MTA’s fleet of buses while also increasing reliability for our customers, creating good jobs, and advancing New York’s climate goals,” Cawle said.\nLieber said that, as the most extensive public bus system in North America, the MTA leads the way to a more sustainable future. “MTA’s ambitious plan to transition to an all zero-emissions fleet by 2040 wouldn’t be possible without upgrades to the electric grid like the Reliable Clean City – Idlewild Project, which gives us the added power we need plus room to expand our program in the future,” he said.\nLocal electeds representing South East Queens said the project is a much-needed upgrade to the community.\nQueens Borough President Richards said he is looking forward to a “ cleaner, greener future for Queens.” Additionally, Richards said the project will help to address the “ disparate health impacts Southeast Queens residents have experienced due to climate change, pollution, and other issues tied to fossil fuel usage. ”\nCouncil Member Selvena Brooks Powers (D-31) focused on how the Reliable Clean City-Idlewild Project will address South East Queens’ climate change-related challenges.\n“As a Council Member representing a coastal community, my neighbors and I are experiencing the devastating challenges climate change poses in real time. The Reliable Clean City – Idlewild Project will improve the electric grid in Southeast Queens, support the electrification of MTA bus depots and fleets, and ensure we are better prepared to face increasingly common extreme weather events,” Powers said.",

    "text": "Ripple's XRP fell 3% on Friday amid whales dump and a drop in funding rates. Recent price action shows that the Ripple-based token may re-test the $2.2 support level. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by valuation, saw a major dump during the day. Members of the XRP community are upset about this action and are curious as to why it was taken. Whales sold 60 million XRP between January 7 and 8, worth about $139 million. XRp lost its bullish momentum as it crashed from a high of $2.4 to $2.2 because of this massive movement, which added to the bearish momentum surrounding it. The altcoin sparked investor optimism at the beginning of 2025. The death cross signal's appearance on its hourly chart raised doubts and concerns regarding XRP's immediate future course. Funding Rate turns Negative XRP's funding rate briefly went negative for the day and is now significantly below the steady 0.01% level. Funding rates are regular payments made between cryptocurrency futures traders to help keep the price of a derivatives contract close to the spot price of its underlying asset. Short traders pay a fee to long traders when funding rates are negative, which indicates increasing bearish pressure. When funding rates are positive, the opposite is true. Open interest is still high despite the recent drop in XRP funding rates to 0.03%, indicating cautious optimism among traders as bearish sentiments have persisted in the market. On the other hand, during bullish seasons, markets frequently recover when funding rates fall below average.",

    "title": "El período colonial de América Latina fue mucho menos católico de lo que parece",
    "text": "Uno de los mitos más extendidos sobre la sociedad colonial latinoamericana es que era católica y punto. Es una historia conocida: Según cuentan los libros de historia, los europeos trajeron su religión al Nuevo Mundo, y ninguno fue tan celoso en sus intentos de convertir a los indígenas como los españoles . De hecho, desde el punto de vista español, la búsqueda de la extensión del catolicismo a todos los rincones del mundo fue un pilar central de la colonización. Un rápido vistazo a lo profundamente católica que sigue siendo gran parte de la región - alrededor del 57% de los latinoamericanos - parece reforzar la idea del éxito de los misioneros españoles. En realidad, el control español en América distaba mucho de ser absoluto. A pesar de las grandes proclamas de los misioneros que afirmaban convertir miles de almas cada día al cristianismo, la vida espiritual en las colonias habría hecho que el Papa se lo pensara dos veces. Lejos del Vaticano Las colonias españolas eran un vasto mosaico de tierras fronterizas construido sobre la infraestructura en llamas de civilizaciones indígenas como la mexica y la inca . Incluso en los centros de control colonial, como Ciudad de México y Lima, el poder español estaba descentralizado , lo que significa que prácticamente ninguna política, orden o ley se aplicaba de forma coherente . El alcance de la corona española dependía tanto de los caprichos de los administradores de bajo rango como de los propios consejeros del rey. La irregularidad de la autoridad colonial también se aplicó en el ámbito de la religión , uno de los focos de mi investigación histórica . A menudo, “conversión” significaba simplemente bautismo . Los sacerdotes rociaban agua sobre la cabeza del converso, le daban un nombre “cristiano” -es decir, hispano- y le animaban a asistir a misa los domingos. Sin embargo, la asistencia era a menudo más irregular que en un aula post-COVID. Hay muchas razones para ello. En primer lugar, la crueldad de algunos españoles difícilmente los convertía en atractivos anuncios del cristianismo . Las legendarias últimas palabras de Hatüey, un líder indígena taíno que dirigió una rebelión en lo que hoy es Cuba, bastan para demostrarlo. Los escritos de Bartolomé de las Casas, como su descripción de la ejecución de Hatüey, ayudaron a registrar la violencia de los colonizadores contra los indígenas en América. Cortesía de la John Carter Brown Library , CC BY-SA En los momentos previos a que Hatüey fuera quemado en la hoguera, un sacerdote le instó a convertirse para que su alma fuera al cielo. Hatüey preguntó si los españoles también iban al cielo . Cuando el cura le respondió que “los buenos sí\", (Hatüey) replicó, sin necesidad de más reflexión, que si así era, entonces él elegía ir al infierno para asegurarse de que nunca más tendría que volver a ver a esos crueles brutos. Bartolomé de las Casas, misionero del siglo XVI, documentó este incidente para condenar la violencia de los colonizadores españoles en América. En segundo lugar, las prácticas espirituales indígenas recibieron un impulso involuntario del propio Papa . Pablo III, papa entre 1534 y 1549, concedió exenciones religiosas especiales a los indígenas de América, ya que eran nuevos conversos o “neófitos” en la fe. En la práctica, este estatus significaba que se les perdonaba no observar correctamente todas las prácticas católicas : no celebrar todas las fiestas, no ayunar a menudo, casarse con primos, etcétera. Este enfoque algo flexible -pero no por ello menos violento- de la conversión significaba que las prácticas espirituales indígenas a menudo se fundían con las españolas . Quizá el mejor ejemplo de este sincretismo religioso sea Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, a quien muchos católicos veneran como una aparición de la Virgen María , incluidos los católicos indígenas. Sin embargo, muchos indígenas también identifican a Guadalupe con Tonantzin . La palabra significa “Nuestra Madre” en náhuatl, la lengua de los mexicas, y podría referirse a múltiples diosas.

Por ejemplo, muchos africanos y sus descendientes utilizaban amuletos protectores llamados “nóminas ” y “ bolsas de mandinga ”,y adaptaron los rituales curativos y los conocimientos médicos africanos a los entornos del Nuevo Mundo . Mientras tanto, la menos conocida trata transpacífica de esclavos trajo miles de asiáticos al México colonial y complicó aún más el panorama religioso. Mi libro de 2024, “ Los primeros asiáticos en América ”, demuestra que los asiáticos utilizaron una amplia variedad de creencias y prácticas para navegar e incluso resistir las condiciones de su esclavitud. Hacían pociones, aprendían encantamientos e incluso renunciaban públicamente a su fe en Dios, Jesús y los santos para llamar la atención sobre el trato injusto. Papeleo y tortura Las autoridades españolas estaban ansiosas por reprimir estas creencias espirituales y fundaron nuevas ramas de la Inquisición en Lima y Ciudad de México a finales del siglo XVI. La Inquisición española llevaba casi un siglo vigilando la frontera entre las prácticas y creencias católicas aceptadas y las heréticas. Mientras que la Inquisición en Europa es famosa por haber juzgado y asesinado a miles de personas, la Inquisición en Ciudad de México reservaba la ejecución sólo para unas pocas docenas de casos . Los latigazos, los destierros, los encarcelamientos y la vergüenza pública eran la norma. Aún así, el sistema carcelario de Estados Unidos ejecuta a más personas cada pocos años que la Inquisición de México a lo largo de más de dos siglos. La mayoría de los indígenas estaban exentos de ser denunciados a la Inquisición, ya que se les consideraba neófitos cristianos y propensos a cometer errores. Sin embargo, africanos y asiáticos, así como sus descendientes, personas de etnias mixtas, “moriscos” (musulmanes conversos), “conversos” (judíos conversos), protestantes e incluso españoles católicos se enfrentaron con frecuencia a los inquisidores. Los juicios de la Inquisición generaban montañas de papeleo, en parte porque los escribanos eran obsesivos en su minuciosidad. En ocasiones, incluso registraban cada exclamación de un prisionero en las famosas cámaras de tortura de la Inquisición. Fachada del Palacio colonial de la Inquisición en Ciudad de México. Thelmadatter/Wikimedia Commons Hoy en día, estos casos proporcionan una visión poco común de las culturas espirituales de los sujetos más marginados de la sociedad colonial. A menudo se acusaba a los no europeos de blasfemia y de preparar pociones de amor para seducir a marineros, soldados y comerciantes. Realizaban rituales con alucinógenos como el peyote para encontrar objetos robados y personas perdidas. Fabricaban amuletos para proteger a amigos, familiares y clientes. Aunque los españoles castigaban la adivinación y otras prácticas no aprobadas, no lo hacían por considerarlas inútiles o ineficaces. Todo lo contrario: Creían que funcionaban, pero que estaban alimentados por el diablo y, por tanto, eran una fuerza del mal. Mosaico espiritual Uno de los casos más enigmáticos sobre los que he escrito es el de un sudasiático esclavizado de Malabar, en el sur de la India, llamado Antón. En 1652 compareció ante la Inquisición en Ciudad de México por los “delitos espirituales” de quiromancia y adivinación. Tenía 65 años y vivía en una fábrica textil de Coyoacán, al sur de la ciudad, famosa por sus malas condiciones laborales. Según múltiples testigos, Antón atraía a una clientela numerosa y multiétnica que a veces viajaba un día en cada dirección para hacerle sus apremiantes preguntas sobre el futuro. Leyendo las palmas de las manos, Antón predecía “si (alguien) encontraría el amor, cuándo nacería un bebé, si una mujer se haría monja, etc.”. Con cada consulta ganaba unas monedas , que repartía con dos tejedores que le traducían del español al náhuatl. Cuando los inquisidores le interrogaron, Antón afirmó haber aprendido a leer las palmas en Malabar e insistió en que no había hecho nada malo. Con todo, la adivinación no se consideraba una infracción religiosa tan grave como, por ejemplo, practicar el judaísmo o el islam, por lo que Antón fue condenado al castigo relativame. Los registros inquisitoriales de la época colonial están llenos de personajes vibrantes como Antón. También estaban Domingos Álvares, que se convirtió en un curandero de renombre en Brasil, y Antonio Congo, de quien se decía que controlaba las tormentas en lo que hoy es Colombia. Crearon mundos de conocimiento y fe a menudo fuera de la línea estricta de la doctrina católica . Muchas de estas creencias han persistido contra viento y marea, sobreviviendo hasta nuestros días. Por ejemplo, la santería afrocubana, Palo Monte , Ifá y otras religiones prosperan hoy en Cuba a pesar de siglos de discriminación y represión. Etiquetar a América Latina y su periodo colonial como uniformemente “católicos” silencia esta rica historia . Por supuesto, había miles de católicos en las colonias, y el catolicismo era un principio central del colonialismo español. Pero esa no es la historia completa: Otras creencias prosperaron y se convirtieron en nuevas realidades de la vida colonial.

    "title": "Camilla's lookalike sister who is the Queen's 'rock': They squabbled as girls, but Annabel Elliot became a moral support and sanctuary in the toughest years. Now, she's starred in a hit Boxing Day documentary, writes ROBERT HARDMAN | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "When Buckingham Palace aides gather to examine the pressing issues facing the monarchy in 2024, I doubt that public indifference will be on the list. The most-watched television event of 2023, by a country mile, was the King's Coronation and the most-watched programme over the holiday period was his Christmas broadcast (just as it was the top-rated TV event this time last year). More noteworthy, perhaps, were the ratings for the following day, since Boxing Day is always a more open field. Yet again, though, it was the King who topped the charts. The BBC1 documentary, Charles III: The Coronation Year was comfortably the most-watched show on one of telly's biggest days of the year. The King and Queen, of course, were the stars of the programme, which followed behind-the-scenes preparations for the Coronation, the events on the day and royal life since. (I must declare an interest since I was part of the small Oxford Films team which made it.) But as many reviewers and commentators have observed, this film also underlined a truth appreciated by families everywhere, royal or otherwise: the importance of sisters. If 'best supporting' plaudits are to be handed out following the documentary, they go to the Princess Royal and to Annabel Elliot, Queen Camilla's younger sister. Camilla, aged just 18, is pictured at a society dance back in 1965, while her younger sister Annabel is pictured right Queen Camilla and her sister Annabel Elliott are pictured watching Andy Murray in action at Wimbledon in 2015 Camilla and her sister Annabel leave a concert together at Spencer House in London in 1998 The British public have long appreciated and admired Princess Anne as an indefatigable, loyal, hard-grafting harbinger of common sense within the royal orbit. We saw it during the late Queen's final years and we have seen it through the new reign. It's a priceless scene in this week's documentary as she greets the newly crowned King, just before stepping out on to the Palace balcony, with: 'Hello, old bean!' Her elder brother roars with laughter and kisses her hand. Less well-known (if known at all), however, is the role of the other sister within the Court. If Queen Camilla can be said to have a best friend and ally, it is surely the sibling 18 months her junior with whom she has been through all the happiest and saddest periods of her life — from the brickbats and intrusion after the end of her first marriage through to her crowning moment at Westminster Abbey. Certainly, there is no one else who could say, with unimpeachable authority of the relationship between the King and Queen: 'She is his rock, and I can't actually emphasise that enough... You know, they're yin and yang, really. They really are polar opposites, but I think it works brilliantly.' What is equally clear is that the Queen has her own 'rock', too. One of the most touching moments in the entire 90-minute film is when the King and Queen are leaving for the Abbey on the morning of the Coronation. Camilla and her younger sister Annabel are pictured as young children. They were born 18 months apart Camilla (L), aged four, and Annabel, aged two, are pictured dressed up as bridesmaids in 1952 Director Ashley Gething and cameraman Chris Openshaw capture Annabel Elliot, in her official role as Queen's Companion, handkerchief in hand, waving off her big sister. 'I thought back to... watching the Queen's Coronation on a tiny black-and-white television,' she recalls later, welling up at the recollection of both 1953 and 2023. 'And there goes this golden coach with my sister in it. I can't explain the feeling because it's so surreal and this cannot be happening. It was quite a moment.' With hindsight, we know May 6 was a great success. However, there was plenty to worry about at the time, not least all the security, the precision timings, the potential protests and the dismal weather — all of it unfolding before a global television audience. 'Going into the Abbey, I think I had that nervousness all the time,' says Annabel, echoing the same protective instincts she has always had for dear Camilla. 'She's quite a bit smaller than I am. I'm feeling: 'Is she going to be all right?' ' That is a feeling which goes right back to a Sussex childhood which both women have described as 'perfect'. Theirs was a very close, loving family. Their father, Major Bruce Shand, was a much-decorated war hero (he won the Military Cross twice), who went on to a career in the wine trade. Their mother, Rosalind, devoted herself to family life and charity work. Following the birth of Camilla in 1947 and Annabel in 1949, brother Mark was born in 1951. The two girls had all the usual rivalries and scrapes. In a documentary to mark the 75th birthday of the then Duchess of Cornwall, Annabel revealed she had still not forgiven her elder sister for burying her adored stuffed toy, Tiddy Bar, in a rose bed. Yet they always had each other's backs as they attended the same schools, competed in the same Pony Club events and later went to the same parties. They married within a year of each other and had children (three in Annabel's case) at the same time, regularly holidaying together in a family group. Annabel (right) and Camilla (left) pictured at the funeral of their father Major Bruce Shand in 2006 King Charles and Camilla are pictured on the day of their Coronation at Buckingham Palace. The Queen's sister, Annabel, is pictured to the right of Camilla When Camilla's first marriage, to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, was coming to an end shortly before that of the then Prince and Princess of Wales, Annabel provided both moral support and sanctuary. Seeking a break from the incessant media coverage, the future Queen and her sister disappeared to Venice together to paint and gather their thoughts. (Both share an artistic streak, one which has steered Annabel through a successful career as a leading interior designer.) When the time finally came for the Prince of Wales to appear in public alongside the 'non-negotiable' woman in his life, this landmark moment was at Annabel's 50th birthday party at The Ritz in 1999. During the years before their 2005 marriage at Windsor, when the Prince and the then Mrs Parker Bowles would spend Christmas apart, she would invariably decamp to the Dorset home of Annabel and her husband, Simon. The two sisters would be 'rocks' to each other following the deaths of their mother, in 1994, their father, in 2006, and, tragically, their younger brother Mark, following an accident in 2014. So when Queen Camilla came to choose the two companions to support and accompany her through the Coronation, it was no surprise at all when she picked Annabel, along with lifelong friend, the Marchioness of Lansdowne. But what viewers of this week's film may not have known is that, all the way through the intense build-up to the ceremony, Annabel was enduring great personal sadness. Simon, the much-respected source of wise counsel and keep-calm-and-carry-on good humour, died in March after a long illness, aged 82. It meant Annabel was arranging the funeral of her husband of more than 50 years at the same time she was preparing for the great occasion at the Abbey. In the finest family traditions of soldiering on, she did just that, as sisters — and 'rocks' — always do. 'She's somebody who is completely loyal,' says Annabel when asked to sum up her sister, 'and she isn't somebody who has huge highs and lows.' I dare say that, if we'd put the same question to Queen Camilla, the answer would have been identical. Charles III: The Coronation Year is available on BBC iPlayer. Charles III. New King. New Court.
