    "title": "MTA buses to fine drivers starting next week for double parking, blocking bus stops",
    "text": "Next week, the MTA will start issuing fines to drivers caught on bus-mounted cameras double parking or stopping their cars at bus stops — expanding the capabilities of its Automated Camera Enforcement Program (ACE).\nACE, an expansion of a similar program only for those parked in bus lanes, has been in effect since June — but until now, the cameras mounted on more than 600 buses across 14 routes have only issued warnings to scofflaw drivers. Starting on Aug. 19, however, those cameras will be issuing fines, aiming to deter the behavior.\nOn Aug. 15, Frank Annicaro, senior vice president of the buses division of MTA New York City Transit, issued a blunt warning to drivers hoping to avoid getting a ticket.\n“Stay out of the way of our buses. Stay out of our bus lanes, do not block our bus stops, do not double-park,” said Annicaro. “When in doubt, you best be sure you’re not blocking a bus route.”\nMTA New York City Transit Senior Vice President of Buses Frank Annicaro, NYC DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and MTA Chief Accessibility Officer Quemuel Arroyo hold a press conference on East 34th St. and 1st Av. on Thursday, Aug 15, 2024 to announce that Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) aboard buses will start issuing fines to drivers who impede bus flow. Marc A. Hermann / MTA Fines start at $50 for a first violation and escalate up to $250 for repeat offenders. The MTA says only 9% of drivers ever commit another violation after receiving a single fine.\nBy year’s end, the MTA says ACE will be activated on more than 1,000 buses across 33 routes in all five boroughs.\nRampant illegal parking blocking traffic has helped make MTA buses the slowest of any major city in the nation , averaging a paltry 8.1 mile per hour speed across the network. The MTA says that bus speeds have increased by about 5% when a line is equipped with camera enforcement, while collisions and emissions also see a drop.\nBut slow speeds are not the only knock-on effect of parking misconduct. Parking at a bus stop can force riders to walk into traffic, while blocking a bike lane can cause cyclists to swerve into traffic.\n“We’re forcing our bus riders to step out into traffic to get on the bus, causing an unsafe condition,” said Annicaro. “Now all these people blocking, they’re receiving warnings, but they’re gonna be getting tickets effective Monday.”\nThe point of the program is not to haul in revenue, but to change driver behavior, said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez.\n“The message is, in order to change the driver behavior, for those people not to get a ticket, they have to be part of the solution,” said Rodriguez. “Not blocking any bus lane.”",

    "text": "Il ne faut pas confondre hypoglycémiant et hypolipémiant. Le premier terme désigne un médicament antidiabétique, qui a pour but de diminuer la glycémie, alors que le second désigne un médicament contre le cholestérol. Et c’est pourtant ce qu’il s’est produit récemment, puisqu’un [comprimé contre le diabète ](https://www.santemagazine.fr/traitement/medicaments/mieux-connaitre-les-medicaments-antidiabetiques-326328)s’est retrouvé dans une boîte de médicaments contre le cholestérol. Si bien que l’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament (ANSM) a dû faire une mise en garde et un rappel de produit.\nUn appel lancé aux patients concernés\n“Nous avons été informés par le laboratoire Arrow de la découverte d’un comprimé de Gliclazide 30 mg à libération modifiée (hypoglycémiant) dans un flacon de comprimés du lot JBM2300810F d’atorvastatine Arrow génériques 10 mg, comprimé pelliculé (hypolipémiant)”, détaille ainsi l’ANSM (Source 1). “Le laboratoire Arrow, en accord avec l’ANSM, rappelle les flacons d’atorvastatine Arrow génériques 10 mg, comprimé pelliculé du lot JBM2300810F. Les patients ayant chez eux un flacon de ce lot sont invités à le rapporter à la pharmacie pour qu’il soit remplacé”, poursuit l’agence gouvernementale.\nLe risque pour les patients qui prendraient du gliclazide au lieu d’atorvastatine est une [hypoglycémie](https://www.santemagazine.fr/sante/fiche-maladie/hypoglycemie-177575), indique l’ANSM, qui se veut rassurante, en précisant qu’aucun cas de pharmacovigilance en lien avec le défaut qualité n’a été rapporté au laboratoire à ce stade (21 novembre).\nPrécisions encore que cette erreur ne concerne qu’un seul flacon d’atorvastatine 10 mg Arrow génériques (30 comprimés vrac), et que les boîtes d’atorvastatine en plaquette sous blister ne sont pas concernées.\nSi la référence JBM2300810F est inscrite sur le flacon, les patients sont invités, non pas à arrêter seul ou modifier leur sans avis médical, mais à rapporter ledit flacon en pharmacie, où le pharmacien en délivrera une nouvelle boîte d’un lot conforme.\nEnfin, en cas de symptômes évocateurs d’une hypoglycémie (sensation de faim anormale, nausées, tremblements, vertiges, maux de tête), les patients prenant de l’atorvastatine 10 mg sont invités à contacter un médecin.",

    "text": "America’s Founding Fathers were wrong about the “God-given rights” enjoyed by American citizens according to far-left MSNBC who declared that the only rights Americans can expect come from the “federal government.” Furthermore, those who echo the Founding Fathers in believing that our rights come from God and not man, are Trump-aligned Christian Nationalists, according to MSNBC panelist Heidi Przybyla.

Christian Nationalists, she went on, believe that their basic rights “don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court, they come from God.” Rarely has the mainstream media made their disdain for Christians so apparent. At a rally in Tennessee earlier this month, 45th President Trump vowed to establish a new task force to fight anti-Christian bias in America, and promised that “No one will be touching the Cross of Christ under the Trump administration.” Trump also told supporters who gathered at the Nashville rally, a city in which a far-left transgender terrorist murdered six Christians in cold blood, including three children, that the Trump administration “will protect God in our public square.” [Baxter Dmitry](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/author/baxter/) Email: [baxter@thepeoplesvoice.tv](mailto:baxter@thepeoplesvoice.tv) Latest posts by Baxter Dmitry ( [see all](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/author/baxter/)) - [MSNBC: Americans Don’t Have ‘God-Given Rights,’ You Have ‘Government-Given Rights’](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/msnbc-americans-dont-have-god-given-rights-you-have-government-given-rights/)- February 23, 2024 - [Putin Slaps Lindsey Graham on Russia’s Most Wanted ‘Terrorists and Extremists’ List](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/putin-slaps-lindsey-graham-on-russias-most-wanted-terrorists-and-extremists-list/)- February 23, 2024 - [‘New Era’: Pope Francis Announces Vatican Is Collaborating With Freemasonry](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/new-era-pope-francis-announces-vatican-is-collaborating-with-freemasonry/)- February 23, 2024",
