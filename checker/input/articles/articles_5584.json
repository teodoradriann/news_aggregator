    "title": "Belgian coalition talks fall apart, chief negotiator quits",
    "text": "BRUSSELS, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Bart De Wever, leader of the Flemish nationalist N-VA, resigned Thursday as the chief negotiator for Belgium's federal government formation after coalition talks fell apart.\nBart De Wever. (File photo: AFP)\nA palace statement said King Philippe accepted De Wever's resignation on Thursday evening and will himself start consultations on Friday with leaders of the five political parties involved in the ongoing negotiations to form a new government.\nDe Wever, appointed on July 10 to lead the coalition talks, had been working to bring together five key parties: the N-VA, the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V), the socialist Vooruit, the French-speaking Reformist Movement (MR) and the centrist Les Engagés.\nHowever, negotiations stalled over De Wever's proposal to introduce a capital gains tax, which was aimed at increasing state revenue by around 500 million euros (some 555 million U.S. dollars) annually.\nThe tax, supported by the Flemish Socialist party Vooruit, was strongly opposed by MR, who viewed it as a threat to investment and Belgium's economic competitiveness.\nGovernment formation in Belgium is often a lengthy process, complicated by the nation's economic, social and administrative divisions across its three regions: Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital, as the country is equally split into three linguistic communities: Dutch, French and German, each with their own governments.\nBelgium holds the world record for the longest government formation period, having gone 541 days without one between 2010 and 2011.",

Here’s a look at some of the most common projects we see homeowners tackle during the warmest season: The start of summer saw heat descend over much of the nation, and we can expect more as the season continues. Here’s a look at some of the most common projects we see homeowners tackle during the warmest season: Air conditioning is often the single most significant energy drain in your home. Regular maintenance can save you money every month on utility bills and improve comfort in the sweltering heat. You should hire an HVAC company to perform a tune-up on your AC, inspect your system and verify everything works smoothly to improve efficiency. This work usually costs about $100; twice-yearly inspections are often included if you have an existing service contract with a local HVAC company. In addition to keeping your system working in tip-top shape, regular inspections ensure that your service company is familiar with it. In many cases, they can catch small and easily repaired problems before they escalate into much larger and costlier system failures. It also helps to have a preexisting relationship with your HVAC company if something goes wrong in the heat. That often helps get you faster service in an emergency. Summer is an excellent time to install new windows. Older windows are more likely to create drafts and don’t block heat as efficiently. Window technology is constantly improving, so a new set of windows can cut energy costs and increase home comfort. Windows also provide an effective way to give your home a whole new look. Check out your weather stripping even if you don’t replace your windows. This is often thought of as a winter project, but weather strips also help keep cool air from escaping the home. Replacing weather stripping is a simple task that can pay off in a big way. Your exterior gets plenty of attention during the summer months, and it’s always the first thing people see when coming to your home. Good landscaping and exterior care increase enjoyment of your home and boost resale value. Cleaning your outside elements plays a significant role in making your home stand out this summer. Pressure washing your siding, decks or driveway can blast away long-standing grime and give your home a shine that looks brand new. Resealing and staining your deck every few years adds to its life span and gives it a face-lift. And, of course, hiring lawn maintenance pros to look after your yard will give your exterior an even better appearance. To make your backyard truly BBQ-ready, add new elements such as native plants or trees, or even an outdoor kitchen, new deck or patio. Features that extend your living area to the outdoors make a great entertaining option for socializing or relaxing and often increase home value. If you’re landscaping on a budget, do projects in phases that build upon each other. Tweet your home care questions with #AskingAngi and we’ll try to answer them in a future column.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
