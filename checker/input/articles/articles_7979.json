    "title": "Congress sounds poll bugle at Nagpur rally",
    "text": "Kharge warns democracy will be finished if BJP, RSS not stopped Mumbai: Sounding the bugle for the 2024 general election, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that the coming polls will be a “battle of two ideologies” as “slavery” works in the BJP. He also promised a nationwide caste census if the Congress was voted to power at the Centre. Addressing a “Hai Taiyyar Hum” rally in Nagpur that kickstarted the Congress’ campaign for next year’s Lok Sabha polls, Mr Gandhi lashed out at the ruling BJP, saying the saffron party is run on an authoritarian ideology like that of erstwhile kings. “There is a fight of ideologies going on in the country. Their (BJP) ideology is the ideology of kings. They don’t listen to anyone, orders just come from above. Whereas in the Congress, the voices come from below, our small workers can point out the big leaders. I listen to our workers and also respect their voice (concerns),” Mr Gandhi said. The freedom struggle was not fought by the kings or rulers of that time, it was fought by the people of the country. Kings and rulers had a partnership with the British. The Congress fought against that partnership for the people of the country, he added. “Vice-chancellors are appointed not on the basis of merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. Unemployment is highest now in the last 40 years,” Mr Gandhi stated. The Congress leader also announced that his party will undertake a caste census if voted to power at the Centre. “We will undertake a caste census after coming to power at Centre, he said. After the Congress made a demand for a caste census, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s language changed and he started saying poverty was the only caste in the country. The Congress will carry out the caste census and give employment to youths, who are deprived of jobs, Mr Gandhi added. The Congress leader also said the BJP wants to take the country back to slavery, alleging that “ghulami” (slavery) works in the saffron party. “A few days ago, I secretly met a BJP MP in the Lok Sabha, who was previously in the Congress. He spoke out of fear, and tension was visible on his face. He said: “BJP mein ghulami chalti hai” (slavery works in the BJP), said the Congress leader. “The BJP leader said that whatever directions are received from the authorities above have to be followed without thinking twice. No one listens to us, orders come from above. It is just like how kings used to give orders earlier and everyone had to follow it. There is no choice whether you like it or not,” Mr Gandhi said. Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the RSS and BJP have ruined the country in the last 10 years and if they are not stopped now, then democracy will be finished. The BJP made a mockery of democracy by suspending 146 Opposition MPs for asking questions and passing the bills in Parliament. The people should teach a lesson to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for not respecting democracy, he added. While Congress’ former president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not attend the rally, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy, Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhvinder Sukhu, Karnataka deputy CM D.K. Shivakumar, and former Maharashtra CMs Prithviraj Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde and Ashok Chavan were present on the occasion.",

    "text": "Willis Gibson has been on a whirlwind media tour since [becoming the first documented human to beat the classic video game Tetris](https://www.stwnewspress.com/news/wunderkind-stillwater-teen-becomes-first-documented-human-to-beat-tetris/article_17e0519c-aa8e-11ee-8520-938fc6bd229c.html). The latest part of the bonanza came with a pair of special guests for Gibson. During a segment with NBC News that aired Friday afternoon, Gibson and his mother, Karin Cox, were surprised during a Zoom call when Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of the game, and Henk Rogers, the founder and chairman of the Tetris Company who helped broker the deal to land the Russian-made game in the hands of Nintendo, joined the interview. “I never thought I would be able to talk to you guys,” the 13-year-old Stillwater native was quoted in a complementary written story on the NBC News website. Prior to surprising Gibson, Rogers spoke with NBC News about watching the moment the original Nintendo version of Tetris was beaten for the first time. “Of course his reaction is great,” Rogers said with a smile. “That’s like the epic achievement. “But what it took for him to get there was incredible determination.” Gibson, who goes by the gamer name Blue Scuti in the Tetris community, then received perhaps the biggest surprise of the interview when Pajitnov introduced himself over the Zoom meeting. “Congrats for you, guy, to beat the program that kind of existed for many years and played by hundreds of millions of people,” Pajitnov said in broken English. “That’s quite (an) achievement, I would say.” Gibson, who was clearly in shock to be talking over the internet with the creator of the global phenomenon that has spawned multiple iterations over the past 40 years, couldn’t find the words when asked what he thought in reaction to the comments from the Russian programmer. “Thank you,” is all Gibson could muster while smiling ear to ear. In the complementary story on the website, another portion of the interaction that did not make the video segment was included. Pajitnov tried to humble the Stillwater Junior High student, who is slated to compete at a live Tetris tournament in Waco, Texas, on Jan. 20-21, with a proclamation to Gibson. “He didn’t crash my game. He crashed the program which was created 40 years ago by NES engineers. So, the game is not crashable at all,” NBC News quoted Pajitnov as saying in the Zoom meeting.",

    "title": "Nice. Un prêtre qui devait être jugé pour agressions sexuelles meurt d'une crise cardiaque",
    "text": "Nice Un prêtre qui devait être jugé pour agressions sexuelles meurt d'une crise cardiaque Jean-Marc Schoepff, 67 ans, ancien aumônier de jeunesse, devait être jugé en septembre pour agressions sexuelles sur mineurs. Sa mort met fin à l'action publique. Un prêtre niçois qui devait être jugé prochainement pour agressions sexuelles sur mineurs est décédé vendredi, a-t-on appris samedi auprès du parquet de Nice, qui a précisé que cette mort met donc fin à l'action publique. Selon [Nice-Matin](https://www.nicematin.com/justice/le-pretre-nicois-poursuivi-pour-agressions-sexuelles-sur-mineurs-est-decede-avant-son-proces-923252), qui révèle cette information, Jean-Marc Schoepff, 67 ans, ancien aumônier de jeunesse, est décédé d’une crise cardiaque. Il a officié dans diverses aumôneries dès les années 1980 Initialement prévu en janvier, devant le tribunal correctionnel de Nice, le procès avait été reporté du fait de l'état de santé de l'un des conseils du prêtre et il avait été reprogrammé en septembre. L'affaire avait éclaté en 2017, avec une plainte déposée par le père de jumeaux quadragénaires dont l'un avait oublié les faits, mis à part des rêves d'attouchements, et l'autre n’osait pas faire la démarche. Suspendu par l'Église Très charismatique et apprécié au sein des diverses aumôneries de jeunes où il a officié à partir des années 1980, le père Jean-Marc Schoepff contestait formellement les faits qui lui étaient reprochés. Interdit de tout ministère auprès des mineurs par la hiérarchie de l’Église en septembre 2017, il avait été suspendu comme curé à l’ouverture de l'information judiciaire en 2018, date à laquelle il avait été brièvement incarcéré. Libéré sous contrôle judiciaire, il avait d’abord résidé en région parisienne avant d'être autorisé à s'installer à Fréjus (Var) puis à revenir à Nice en décembre 2021. Neuf victimes ont porté plainte Au total, neuf personnes avaient dénoncé des attouchements, essentiellement à l'occasion de sorties ou de camps de vacances. Mais les faits dénoncés remontaient pour la plupart aux années 1980 et étaient prescrits pour sept des plaignants. Sur les deux plaignants qui restaient, l'un est né en 1985 et a porté plainte en 2019 pour des faits remontant à un voyage à Rome en 1997. L'autre, né en 1982, situe les faits en 1996, quand il était élève à Stanislas, un établissement privé catholique renommé à Nice. La quasi-totalité des plaignants dénonçant des faits prescrits devaient cependant s'exprimer comme témoins au procès.",
