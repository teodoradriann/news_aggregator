    "title": "Attacks on Churches Spike Nearly 800% in 6 Years as Dems Vilify Christians – PJ Media",
    "text": "Attacks on churches in the United States have reportedly gone up by a staggering 800% in less than six years. Christianity is under assault here in America, but all Democrats do is screech about the fake crisis of “Christian nationalism.”\nA Family Research Council (FRC) report published this month analyzed data from 2018 through 2023. From arson to bomb threats to vandalism to gun incidents, churches have seen a worrying rise in active hostility. This appears to have escalated particularly since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, with the Supreme Court recognizing that there is no federal right to abortion.\n“In 2023, Family Research Council identified 436 incidents—more than double the number identified in 2022 and more than eight times the number identified in 2018,” the report announced. “These findings suggest that hostility against U.S. churches is not only on the rise but also accelerating.” And yet Democrats appear to be fueling the crisis by constantly vilifying Christians.\nFRC documented each of the attacks on churches in its report. Pro-abortion radicals have attacked many since Roe was overturned, even though the federal government is currently prosecuting peaceful pro-lifers instead of the many violent pro-abortion activists. Transgender radicals also committed a few of the attacks. A motive was not listed for many other attacks, including vandalism and arson.\nDoors, musical instruments, Bibles, electronics, windows, and Catholic religious statues were among the items and building parts damaged or destroyed. Tragic shootings and stabbings left individuals connected with churches dead or injured. Whole church buildings, or parts of them, were set on fire. Where is the mass outcry — from either Democrat or Republican politicians? Where is the White House task force to investigate anti-Christian hate? Where are the media reports on the epidemic of church attacks? Christians can be persecuted and attacked in America, and it seems most of the mainstream media and government could not care less. Some in media and government are actively encouraging hatred of Christians.\nFor instance, in December, The Atlantic hysterically announced that “The Only Thing More Dangerous Than Authoritarianism” is “Christian nationalism... now ascendant both inside the Church and inside the Republican Party.” Because, as we know, Christians have a regular habit of attacking mosques or shooting leftist protestors while screaming, “Jesus is great!”\nMeanwhile, The Hollywood Reporter propagandized recently about a film smearing Christians, “‘God & Country' Review: A Bracing, Rob Reiner-Produced Primer on the Dangers of Christian Nationalism.” Salon wants you to think Donald Trump is an evil, crazy dictator because he believes in religion being part of a politician’s decision-making: “Apocalypse now: Donald Trump dons the ‘armor of God’ — and pushes for theocracy.”\nNor is this insanity new; in July 2022, TIME sobbed , “Faith Is Powerful. That’s Why Christian Nationalism Is So Dangerous.” And back in 2021, TIME was scaremongering about “The Growing Anti-Democratic Threat of Christian Nationalism in the U.S.” Conservative Christians are constantly painted as violent, authoritarian traitors who hate democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Are we surprised that some vandals and criminals take the media at their word?\nAs attacks on churches and Christians continue to escalate, the leftists who are encouraging hatred against these same Christians have a great deal to answer for. When Jesus separates the sheep from the goats, there will be a lot of donkeys in the latter party.",

    "title": "Microsoft tries to woo Google Chrome users with pop-ups",
    "text": "Microsoft Edge has definitely come a long way, slowly adding new features and capabilities that make it a competitive choice among browsers.\nWith tools like an AI assistant and boasting a streamlined design, Edge is Microsoft’s bold step toward delivering a fully integrated browser experience for Windows users.\nBut the company’s relentless push to make it your go-to browser has some users questioning just how far Microsoft will go.\nMicrosoft Edge is a solid browser, and it’s been at the heart of Microsoft’s push to improve browsing experiences, working hard to establish itself as a viable alternative to Google Chrome. The company’s tried everything from hints to straight-up in-your-face tactics to persuade Windows users to try Edge. While not all strategies have been successful, Microsoft is not giving up and is constantly looking for new ways to increase the number of Edge users.\nThe latest? Edge now automatically launches when you start up your computer and constantly prompts you to bring over your Chrome data, like browsing history, bookmarks, open tabs, and more.\nRecently, The Verge noticed that when you boot up your PC, Edge might pop open and hit you with a prompt promoting its AI assistant, Copilot. Alongside this pop-up, there’s a pre-checked box that lets Edge automatically pull in data from other browsers like Chrome. Understandably, this tactic has stirred up frustration over how aggressively Microsoft is pushing its products.\nMicrosoft has openly acknowledged that this is intentional. It claims users can opt out, but the default settings and that prominent import button are not easy to ignore, making it tricky for users to sidestep the data transfer if they’re not paying close attention before clicking.\nEven if you manage to close the pop-ups, Edge doesn’t give up so easily. Uninstalling the browser isn’t straightforward, and some Windows updates will just reinstall it automatically — definitely frustrating for users who prefer other options.\nThe prompts appeared earlier this year but were removed after Microsoft rolled the feature back. Now, it’s made a return. Microsoft’s Caitlin Roulston told The Verge that the notification is just there to offer users “the choice to import data from other browsers.”\nMicrosoft has been using strong persuasive tactics to promote Edge for a while now. Back in 2022, it introduced a feature that would automatically pull data from Chrome to Edge (at least it was optional then). And in 2021, it even made it almost impossible to set another browser as default, a move that caused enough backlash for the company to eventually dial it back.\nMicrosoft’s persistence with these types of tactics isn’t doing its reputation any favours. Many users are starting to question the trustworthiness of Edge, Windows 11, and even Microsoft’s broader AI efforts. The controversy around intrusive prompts should signal to Microsoft that these aggressive Edge pop-ups in Windows 11 could make it hard for people to commit to its AI-driven plans for the platform.\n(Photo by appshunter.io )\nSee also: Google reportedly plans first US tech data centre in Vietnam\nWant to learn more about cybersecurity and the cloud from industry leaders?

Part of his routine was a weekly cheat meal that helped him improve mentally as well as physically.\n“Nothing wrong with having a cheat meal once or twice a week.”\n“You got something to look forward to. I used to have a cheat meal once a week. Even when I was getting ready for Mr. Olympia, up until three weeks out. I used to go out on Saturday and have one meal, what I wanted, nothing wrong with that.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by DY Nutrition™ (@dynutrition)\nYates continued to speak on the importance of discipline but there are also times where bodybuilders must enjoy themselves, especially with family or friends. There is a chance for balance within the sport.\n“It’s great to be disciplined but it’s not necessary to, let’s say you have a birthday or Christmas where you go with the whole family, there’s no need to sit there with your can of dry tuna and everybody else is enjoying the food and the celebrations and everything like that. So, keep a bit of balance there.”\nFor more news and updates, follow Generation Iron on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .",

    "text": "COWETA, Okla. — Water, snacks and cots can be found inside CrossPoint Baptist Church in Coweta. Friday night the church opened its doors as a warming shelter. “We wanted to give a warm place through this dangerous weather, to give them a place that they can come to, to have a warm meal, to have a warm bed,” said Brett Wheeler, the pastor at CrossPoint Baptist Church. We asked Wheeler why they became a warming shelter. “The answer would really be with one word and that’s God, to know that God put it on our heart to be obedient to him,” Wheeler said. CrossPoint Baptist Church partnered with Wagoner County Emergency Management (WCEM) for the shelter. The church provides volunteers and space and WCEM provides the supplies. “We have all the slots filled for 24 hours of volunteers here to help and just to be here and show Jesus to people that need the love during this cold season,” Wheeler said. Wheeler said they just want to be able to help those in need. “It breaks your heart to know that there’s people out there shivering in cold during this time and have nothing,” Wheeler said. Matt Rose with WCEM said over these next couple days, they will be on the lookout for stranded motorists, people struggling with homelessness and people without power. “We were just really happy that Pastor Wheeler and CrossPoint Baptist Church were able to step up and provide that warming shelter,” Rose said. We asked Rose what their plans are if the weather gets any worse. “For the citizens it’s obviously the warming shelters, of course as this system moves in tomorrow, throughout the weekend, you know our main goal will then focus onto the roadways,” Rose said. CrossPoint Baptist Church will be open through Monday but plans to stay open as long as there is a need.",
