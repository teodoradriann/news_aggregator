    "text": "There May Be Someone At The White House With More Contempt For A Colleague Than John Kelly Has For His Boss\nImagine sitting across the Cabinet table from someone who could have saved you from a $100 million loss.\n- •\n- Updated:· Original:\nThere are lots of reasons why meetings of the United States Cabinet might be awkward. For one, Donald Trump speaks at them.\nSteve MnuchinandWilbur Ross, too. AlsoBen Carson. When Scott Pruitt pulls up to the White House in cars hecan’t possibly afford, it has to elicit a few groans. Everyone is swimming in a sea of incompetence, this combination of factors must make for some seriously unpleasant hours on the calendar of the oligopoly currently mismanaging the hell out of America, U.S.A. And those are just the general factors. Then there are the interpersonal issues, such as the one between the president and his chief of staff, who apparently\nhate each other’s guts. But that’s not the only intramural squabble. For while Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her family didn’t lose the most money on blood-testing bloodbath Theranos (that would be Theranos founderElizabeth Holmes) or the most actual money on the thing (that would be the Walton family), she and her kin arenine figures lighter from the experience. And sitting across the Cabinet table from her isa guy who had a unique insight into how and why they lost that money. A guy with an arguably fiduciary duty to the DeVoses and Coxes and Rupert Murdoch and Carlos Slim and Bob Kraft and every other poor bastard who gave Holmes a nickel. And now, thanks tothis lawsuit, we know the extent of this particular Cabinet-level blood feud.High on the list is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose family invested $100 million in the Silicon Valley blood-testing company, the documents show. Mrs. DeVos had previously disclosed that her family was a Theranos investor in a government filing, but the size of the investment wasn’t known.“The investment was made by many members of the DeVos family,” not just Mrs. DeVos, says Greg McNeilly, chief operating officer of Windquest Group, Mrs. DeVos and her husband’s family holding company. “To say they’re highly disappointed in Theranos as a company and an investment is an understatement.”\nAs if to make matters worse, while DeVos can only seem to generate",

    "title": "Apple AirTag helps family track down their stolen suitcase and nab the thief",
    "text": "Apple's AirTag item tracker has come to the rescue again. Per The Queen City News , the Gavino family was visiting the North Carolina mountains from Miami, Florida because they had a dream to celebrate Christmas in the Carolinas. Last Friday, after flying into Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the family realized that one of their bags never surfaced on the carousel. But there was hope that the luggage could be found.\nThe night before, Catherine Gavino had purchased AirTag item trackers and after taking the advice of several online influencers, she tossed an AirTag into each bag not thinking that she really might need to track a missing suitcase. \"It was to help find luggage if it was lost, but I never thought it'd get stolen,” she said.\nThe Find My app showed the stolen bag on Interstate 85, heading west toward Gastonia\nAfter realizing that one bag was not showing up, Catherine fired up the Find My app on her iPhone and saw that the missing luggage was on the move. The bag was traveling on Interstate 85 and heading west toward Gastonia. After quickly renting a vehicle, the Gavino family started following the AirTag to a neighborhood. But the search had to be called off after the AirTag stopped displaying any information.\nCatherine Gavino shows how she found the stolen suitcase containing an Apple AirTag\nThe luggage contained clothing that Catherine's mother and father had bought especially for the trip. Once the family couldn't track the location of the luggage, it had to be repurchased.\nOn Christmas Day, the Gavino family decided to take one last crack at retrieving the suitcase. After dropping off two family members at the airport, Catherine opened the Find My app once again and was able to track the AirTag to a house on McGuire Street in Gastonia. \"I told my dad who was with me, 'Look it’s only 20 minutes, let’s swing by.'\" After driving by the house, she called the police.\nThe cops entered the home and recovered the Gavino family's luggage and the suitcase belonging to another person who also had their baggage stolen at the airport. Catherine said that the police had told her that \"someone else called with the same issue. And they had an AirTag.\" The cops had come to the same area earlier the same day to recover that other bag, but for some reason, it was pinging in the wrong house.\nWhile the bag was recovered, the contents of the suitcase could not be found\nWhile the Gavino family recovered the stolen suitcase, the contents of the luggage were nowhere to be found and the police believe that the clothes were sold. Catherine said, \"Police believe they may have sold the clothes for money, who knows. These are my parents, coming to the mountains for a North Carolina view, so for this to happen made me sad, which was all the more reason to go after them…I wouldn’t have found them without this AirTag.\"\nA suspect was arrested by the police and charged with charged with multiple theft crimes, and a drug charge. He is being held on $10,000 bail. Catherine Gavino explained why she continued to track down the suitcase and spent so much time getting it back. \"I wanted justice,\" she said.\nApple continues to sell individual AirTag trackers for $29 and a set of four can be purchased for $99. That is a savings of $17 or 15% if you purchase the package of four. And in the online Apple Store you'll find several key rings and other accessories offered for your Apple AirTag. By the way, you can have your AirTag engraved for free when you purchase it from the online Apple Store.\nFollow PhoneArena on Google News Recommended Stories",

    "text": "Opinion Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Photo: Wiki Commons.\nJNS.org – The prominent Yiddish writer B.Z. Goldberg once visited the Lubavitcher Rebbe and, as he entered the Rebbe’s study, he said, “Lubavitcher Rebbe, you look well.”\nThe Rebbe responded, “Since when is that a Jewish compliment? Usually, Jews ask each other why they look so bad.”\nThe Rebbe’s sense of humor notwithstanding, it does seem traditional for Jews to complain. God knows, we’ve had ample reason to over the centuries, including right now. Has there ever been a time in our history when there’s been a shortage of Yiddishe Tzorres , problems and persecutions, troubles and torment?\nThis Shabbat, we read in the final chapters of Vayikra that if we follow the way of God our lives will be blessed, but should we stray from the good path we will experience curses and calamities second to none.\nParshat Bechukotai opens with a wonderful promise: “If you will follow My decrees and observe My commandments … the rains will come in time … and the land will give its produce … and you will dwell securely in your land.”\nBut is that really true? What about all the righteous who have suffered and the wicked who have prospered? Is life really so simple? And doesn’t the Talmud state that reward and punishment are reserved for the next world?\nRambam, the great Maimonides, explains it this way: These blessings are not the reward for our good behavior. Rather, they are how God provides us with the necessary tools to live a full Jewish life.\nYou might think, “It’s hard to be a Jew,” but if you have no money, it’s much harder! Living Jewishly can be expensive. Just recently, a congregant who has fallen on hard times confessed that they stopped keeping kosher because it was too expensive. Tuition fees at Jewish day schools are much higher than state schooling. The prices of matzah and an etrog keep going up, and so on.\nAnd yet the Rambam says the blessings at the beginning of our parsha are not our reward, but rather God giving us the material means by which we will be able to afford to live a Godly life.\nWhen do we earn these blessings? When we indicate by our concrete actions that it is our desire and intent to live such a Godly life. When the Almighty sees our sincere and genuine good intentions, He then assists us in fulfilling these righteous desires by providing us with the necessary wherewithal to do so.\nConcrete action means more than just “joining the club.” We must indicate our genuine commitment to following the good path in real, tangible terms. It’s more than just standing up to be counted. We need to put these ideals into practice in our daily lives.\nHere are two examples: People want to keep Shabbat, but work often gets in the way. I knew a plumber who once confessed that he was trying to observe Shabbat but, somehow, every Saturday he would get an emergency call. It took him a while, but he finally worked out a system with other people on standby. He has now been a serene Sabbath observer for many years. But he made the commitment first.\nToo many of our young people are struggling to find their bashert , their life partner in marriage. Sadly, many have succumbed to the “easier” solution and broadened their search beyond the Jewish community. Yet I have seen many who held their ground and never lost focus, as difficult as it was, and eventually did find a wonderful Jewish partner in life. Again, they made the commitment, stuck to it through thick and thin, and in time, they were blessed.\nYes, Shabbat can appear to be a challenge to our seeming prosperity. Having strict shidduch principles can seem like an obstacle to getting married. But in the end, if we stick to our values and principles, God Almighty will come to our assistance, sometimes in ways we would never have imagined.\nTrue stories abound. I see it all the time. Those who exhibited faith and trust in God and closed the shop on Saturdays survived and flourished, even though the numbers didn’t add up. Those who refused to compromise in their courtships are today happily married and raising beautiful Jewish families.\nThere is a relevant line in this week’s Haftorah from the Prophet Jeremiah: “ Baruch hagever , blessed is the man who trusts in Hashem, then Hashem will be his security.”\nSome years ago, this line became a popular song. May we sing it and, more importantly, live it.\nThe opinions presented by Algemeiner bloggers are solely theirs and do not represent those of The Algemeiner, its publishers or editors.

    "text": "The Government are under pressure to pass new laws to tackle unauthorised entry to football fixtures, following a probe into the chaos of the Euro 2020 final at Wembley. Currently, there is a surprising lack of criminal penalty to punish those trying to enter stadiums with fake tickets or through force. But MPs are pushing to ensure this is tackled via the Unauthorised Entry to Football Matches Bill, which would allow a banning order to be imposed on conviction. As well as the disorder at Wembley, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee also studied scenes experienced by Liverpool supporters at the Champions League final in Paris last year. In their report, released on Friday, the committee describe the treatment of English fans as 'disgraceful' and say greater collaboration is needed between police forces, at home and aboard. The Government are under pressure to pass new laws to tackle unauthorised entry to matches There is a lack of criminal penalty to punish those trying to enter stadiums with fake tickets Dame Caroline Dinenage has admitted that there is much work to be done in terms of preventing disorder at football matches Your browser does not support iframes. They are also calling for the expansion of safe standing trials and for a crackdown on the increasing use of Class A drugs at stadiums. Dame Caroline Dinenage, chair of the CMS committee, said: 'Sadly, the rise in disorder at football post-pandemic, and near disasters at Wembley and in Paris, have shown there is much to be done. 'The Government, police, clubs and governing bodies all have a role to play.'",

    "text": "El anuncio de Jannik Sinner, tenista número 1 en la siembra global de la ATP, de retirarse de los Juegos Olímpicos de París es un claro indicador de la latente preocupación entre los jugadores respecto a la sobrecarga de actividad física en competencias deportivas internacionales que está generando una controversia creciente sobre el estado físico y mental de los atletas. En disciplinas como el tenis y el futbol, la proliferación desenfrenada de torneos y partidos ha alcanzado niveles alarmantes. Mientras las organizaciones deportivas amasan fortunas con esta expansión, los atletas se enfrentan a una presión física y mental insostenible que podría tener consecuencias devastadoras a largo plazo. El calendario del tenis profesional es una verdadera locura. Jugadores de alto nivel, como Rafael Nadal y Novak Djokovic, están atrapados en una maratón interminable de torneos, incluyendo los cuatro Grand Slams, los torneos Masters 1000 y numerosos eventos adicionales. Esta carga de trabajo inhumana ha resultado en una serie de lesiones recurrentes y fatiga crónica entre los jugadores. En 2018, Rafael Nadal se vio obligado a retirarse de varios torneos debido a problemas continuos con su rodilla y otras lesiones causadas por el desgaste físico. En una entrevista, Nadal destacó cómo la falta de descanso adecuado entre torneos no solo afecta el rendimiento en la cancha, sino que también pone en riesgo la salud a largo plazo de los atletas. Según estudios de la Asociación de Jugadores de Tenis Profesionales, un número significativo de jugadores sufre lesiones relacionadas con la sobrecarga y el estrés repetitivo. El futbol, lejos de estar exento, enfrenta una situación igualmente crítica. Con la adición de nuevas competiciones como la Liga de Naciones de la UEFA y la expansión de torneos tradicionales, los futbolistas se ven obligados a lidiar con un calendario cada vez más congestionado. Estrellas como Lionel Messi y Cristiano Ronaldo han expresado su preocupación por la cantidad de partidos que deben disputar en una temporada. Un estudio publicado por la Federación Internacional de Futbolistas Profesionales (FIFPro) en 2019 reveló que muchos jugadores están al borde del colapso debido a la falta de descanso adecuado. La investigación mostró que un jugador de alto nivel puede participar en más de 70 partidos en una temporada, sin contar las intensivas sesiones de entrenamiento. Esta sobrecarga no solo disminuye el rendimiento, sino que también incrementa el riesgo de lesiones y acorta significativamente la carrera profesional de los jugadores. La situación se exacerba en años donde se celebran Juegos Olímpicos o Mundiales de Futbol. Durante estos años, los jugadores no solo participan en sus competiciones regulares, sino que también deben prepararse y competir en estos eventos de gran escala, lo que añade una carga adicional y casi insostenible. Estos torneos internacionales demandan un nivel de rendimiento excepcional, obligando a los atletas a esforzarse más allá de sus límites habituales y reduciendo aún más su tiempo de recuperación. El impacto a largo plazo de esta sobrecarga de actividad física es alarmante y, francamente, escandaloso. Las carreras de los atletas pueden acortarse drásticamente debido a lesiones crónicas y agotamiento. Los estudios indican que los atletas que no tienen períodos de descanso adecuados y están constantemente bajo presión física y mental tienen muchas más probabilidades de retirarse prematuramente. La salud mental también está en juego. La presión constante para rendir, combinada con la falta de tiempo para la recuperación y el descanso, puede llevar a graves problemas de salud mental como la ansiedad y la depresión. El caso de Naomi Osaka, quien se retiró de varios torneos para proteger su salud mental, es un ejemplo impactante de cómo el calendario competitivo puede destrozar el bienestar de los atletas. La pregunta candente es si este incremento en el número de eventos y competencias realmente vale la pena. Desde una perspectiva económica, las organizaciones deportivas y los patrocinadores se benefician enormemente del creciente número de torneos y partidos. Sin embargo, este enfoque miope está ignorando por completo el bienestar de los atletas a largo plazo. El bienestar de los atletas debe ser una prioridad indiscutible. Las organizaciones deportivas deben reevaluar la estructura de los calendarios competitivos para incluir períodos de descanso adecuados. Además, se deben implementar políticas que permitan a los atletas recuperarse física y mentalmente, garantizando así carreras más largas y saludables. En conclusión, la sobrecarga de actividad física en competencias deportivas internacionales está llevando a un desgaste insostenible en los atletas. Mientras que las ganancias inmediatas son tentadoras, el costo a largo plazo para los deportistas es exorbitante. Es imperativo que las organizaciones deportivas tomen medidas urgentes para equilibrar las demandas competitivas con la salud y el bienestar de los atletas. ¿Estamos siendo víctimas de nuestra propia ambición al destruir a los mejores deportistas del mundo con esta carga excesiva de actividad, con afán de generar más dinero?

    "title": "Music Therapy Week 2024: Science student turned musical therapy graduate returns to heal Hawke’s Bay - NZ Herald",
    "text": "It’s a question that registered professionals have been asking since the 1940s and 50s: How can banging a drum or attempting to strum a guitar help aid personal growth and heal trauma? April 10-15 is World Music Therapy Week , and Mitchell Hageman chatted with graduate musical therapist Sinead Hegarty, who swapped her beakers for bongos in a quest to heal her home region of Hawke’s Bay . The smiles on the faces of Raukatauri Music Therapy clients and supporters at the Take Off children’s festival parade in Hastings on Thursday proved there was definitely something behind the noise. The often-misunderstood practice of music therapy has helped heal trauma and aid development professionally for over 50 years. Many new practitioners are entering the field, including Hawke’s Bay graduate musical therapist Sinead Hegarty who received her science degree in Dunedin, but after travelling the world discovered her passion for music and how it could heal. “Music really allows you to bring your inner world to something with a form that’s expressed externally,” she told Hawke’s Bay Today. “Verbally explaining what you’re feeling can be hard. Music allows you to exist as a complex and multidimensional person.” Hegarty’s love of people and music prompted her to shift to musical therapy in the region. “I feel like there’s a really cool network of people to support the Hawke’s Bay community.” Hegarty said a range of people, from babies to people in hospice care benefit from the service. Classes at the Raukatauri Music Therapy Centre at Taikura House also provide a safe space. “Music therapy is the planned use of music for the healing and growth development of people with various challenges,” registered music therapist and Hegarty’s mentor Ella Polczyk-Przybyla said. “Through creating a therapeutic relationship with a client, you’re building up connection and collaboration by playing music together, and then you can focus on either musical or non-musical goals.” She said it was not a prerequisite to be a musician to have music therapy. The pair have worked with a wide range of people, including babies, those with disabilities, respite care patients and those who lived through trauma such as Cyclone Gabrielle . “We all have this intrinsic musicality, which is why music therapy works.” According to the pair, the best way for people to support music therapy was to be vocal about it. “Think about who in your family could benefit from music therapy because it really is a supportive intervention and a community you become part of.” Mitchell Hageman joined Hawke’s Bay Today in January 2023. From his Napier base, he writes regularly on social issues, arts and culture, and the community. He has a particular love for stories about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.",

    "text": "Microsoft Edge stopped 127 million phishing attacks this year By Abhinav Anand December 29, 2023 Microsoft Edge is striving hard to gain momentum. This year, the company has packed its browser with several useful tools, including Copilot . This follows Microsoft’s in-app attempt to bash you when you try downloading Google Chrome . But that’s the least to speak of. Microsoft recently released the Edge stats for 2023, showing how people use the browser in everyday life. Some revelations that caught our eyes are, as follows. First, Edge and Bing users used Copilot more than 1.9 million times. It’s the era of AI. So, here comes another: the users generated over 1.8 billion AI-generated images. The best part of this report is, Microsoft Edge notably saved users from over 127 million phishing attacks.\nMicrosoft Edge saved users from over 127 million phishing attacks As the internet advanced and technology became more accessible, it also opened doors for scammers, data thieves, and others alike. In its latest report, Microsoft claims it stopped over four phishing attacks every second throughout the year. Advertisement Advertisement\nMicrosoft Edge comes with built-in shopping assistants to help users save a few bucks. It released Copilot Shopping services in November which helps find the best deals for any product using prompts. The released stats say the US saved an average of $400 annually, while global shoppers received over $4 billion in savings through Edge.\nIt doesn’t stop here; Microsoft also offered over 148 million reward points to gamers throughout the year. That’s about the cost of 1,000 years of an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, as per the company. You can read the full report here for more interesting stats.\nAll in all, Microsoft’s web browser is surpassing the expectations of users, making a place for itself amid the dominating competition, and trying to reclaim the lost crown. And as Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates once said, “Competition is always a fantastic thing, and the computer industry is intensely competitive.” While its plans remain under wraps, Microsoft Edge is likely to integrate more AI tools in the coming months…and years.",

While showcasing Jewish history and heritage is important, the stones of the Wall should never be removed for this purpose,\" the Rabbi wrote.\n\"A stone from the Western Wall does not belong in the Knesset or any other location. Its rightful place is among the stones of the Wall, preserved where it belongs,\" he added.\nArtifacts on display\nThe other artifacts include agricultural tools from a Hasmonean-era farm, a Hasmonean coin hoard, and objects acting as physical evidence of the name “Ahab,” the king who ruled northern Israel in the 9th century BC, among other things.\nThe artifacts will remain on display at the exit passage of the airport until 2026.\nJoanie Margulies contributed to this report.",
