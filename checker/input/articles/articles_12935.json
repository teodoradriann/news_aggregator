A darne notizia la Capitaneria di porto - Guardia costiera di Trieste. Le raffiche hanno raggiunto il picco massimo di 80 chilometri all&#039;ora. &quot;L&#039;equipaggio della nave K-Stream - fa sapere la Capitaneria in una nota - ha risolto in autonomia la situazione, rinforzando gli ormeggi e rimanendo in banchina. La nave Ulusoy-14 è riuscita ad accendere i motori e, con pilota a bordo, a dare fonda all&#039;ancora. Situazione più critica per la nave Maersk Hidalgo, risolta con l&#039;intervento di rimorchiatori, ormeggiatori e piloti, grazie ai quali è stata ricondotta in sicurezza presso il proprio ormeggio&quot;. Una motovedetta della Guardia Costiera è intervenuta anche per sgomberare il molo Audace, nel centro cittadino, gremito di gente nonostante le onde alte e il vento forte. (ANSA).",

    "title": "Specialty Value-Based Care is Improving Health Outcomes While Reducing Heath Care Costs",
    "text": "Delivering value-based care is expected to become even more prevalent, driven by factors such as patient comfort with digital tools and advancements in contractual arrangements. There are an increasing number of innovative, digital companies providing specialty value-based care (VBC) solutions. These platforms serve as an important bridge between patients, physicians and insurance companies, providing increased access to health care tools, consultations, and holistic disease management with the goal being to better manage a patient’s condition(s) before they escalate. This improves patient outcomes and reduces healthcare utilization, hence costs. Further, digital, specialty care companies address historic health care disparities in access to care by improving online access to specialty care providers. The World Economic Forum predicts that within the next seven years 30 percent of all the world’s data will be directly connected and stem from the healthcare industry.1 Starting before the pandemic, but truly taking off in the United States when there was urgency to stay connected to patients during social distancing, digital health tools are collecting and aggregating data in multiple ways. Today, physicians are better able to closely monitor their patients through the use of enterprise systems with predictive analytics tools, electronic medical records and point of care tools that connect health systems, individual providers, and hospitals, and, perhaps most importantly, the increasing use of digital health tools by patients. Beyond attending telehealth appointments, which help overcome barriers to primary and specialty care created by location, costs (missed work, childcare, parking, etc.), or social stigma,2 patients contribute data by engaging with fitness/lifestyle wearables, diagnostic monitoring devices and/or biometric sensors, and inputting data into remote patient monitoring devices, platforms, and apps. Leveraging these technologies and harnessing the immense output of data has made value-driven care more than a buzzy concept, but a practical and highly desirable healthcare model to improve patient outcomes and drive down health costs. This change was supported by the Affordable Care Act and subsequent formation of Accountable Care Organizations that transformed how healthcare is conceived, delivered and paid for.3,4 Hence, providers and companies that specialize in VBC care are attractive to investors because of measurable, data driven outcomes.5 Data suggests that digital health funding is on track to surpass the funding peaks of 2019 and 2023, underscoring a robust investor confidence in digital health innovations.6 One of the most promising applications of digital health tools, platforms and apps is the ability to address specific patient populations, thereby improving the ability of individual patients and their providers to monitor the escalation of symptoms, treatment experience, and delivery of additional holistic, supportive interventions. For example, gastrointestinal (GI) care is $136B of medical spend in the US, which is more than heart disease ($113 billion), trauma ($103 billion), or mental health ($99 billion).7 Recent estimates suggest that the U.S. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment market size is worth USD 9.37 billion in 2022, with a projected growth at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period.8 IBD is high cost because these patients (those specifically diagnosed with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease) always requires close monitoring to reduce the risk for complications that lead to lengthy hospital stays and significant medical spend. SonarMD is a digital, holistic health platform for IBD patients enrolled in one of the large health plans that are in a value-based arrangement with us. Each month patients take secure, clinically-validated, text-based symptoms surveys to evaluate their symptoms and calculate their degree of risk of deterioration. Studies show that the program significantly reduces emergency department visits and in-patient admissions compared to risk-matched control groups, meaning healthcare utilization is down. For example, in a retroactive, 24-month study comparing a SonarMD engaged population (n=495) with IBD against a risk-matched, control population (n=2,695) in New Jersey, in year one (2021), the rate of IBD-related emergency department visits for the SonarMD cohort was 18% lower than the control group and in year two (2022) the rate was 46% less. Similarly, hospital admissions were down by 20% in year one and down 78% in year two compared to the control group.9 Another digital specialty organization with validated health outcomes is Omada Health, which services people living with diabetes, hypertension, or musculoskeletal conditions. Their peer-reviewed data shows high engagement with their platforms, reduced healthcare utilization, and improved patient outcomes.10 For example, one study shows that the estimated gross savings in medical expenditures across their cardiometabolic programs in 2022 dollars were $892 to $1,342 after one year, and cumulative estimated gross medical savings were $2,963 to $4,346 after three years and $5,221 to $7,756 after five years.11 Similarly, Wildflower Health, a specialty company specializing in virtual workflows for maternal health, reported improved outcomes and reduced costs, particularly in high-risk women.12 Recent claims data from a large, national insurer demonstrated a $43,000 lower claims costs per high-risk user and $2,000 lower claims costs per healthy user who were enrolled in the program.13 These examples demonstrate how VBC puts patient outcomes first but keeps the business of medicine in mind by reducing costs. Interestingly, SonarMD and Wildflower Health are two value-added, specialty care companies that are led by women and there are many others including Iron Health, Tailor Care, Midi Health and Maven Clinic, to name a few. What is driving this trend when across healthcare women remain underrepresented in leadership roles?14 Research suggests15 that it might have to do with their ability to embrace change while dialing down risk, plus women-led companies are often more profitable.16 Beyond women taking the lead, experts predict increasing growth of VBC stemming from the combination of patients’ increasing comfort with and use of digital tools and the refinement of contractual arrangements between companies, payers, and providers. That being said, risk agreements need to take into account different U.S. state laws that determine the levels of risk that providers and/or intermediaries may take. This barrier will get smoothed out as the health care industry, as a whole, increases familiarity with VBC partnerships.17 Very likely the forthcoming 2030 deadline set by Medicare/Medicaid to have 100 percent of Medicare users in an accountable relationship will drive additional VBC opportunities.18 It seems obvious that individual patient outcomes should drive health care decisions, but for many decades, the mechanisms were not in place to deliver primary and specialty care to patients, whether they lived near medical centers of excellence or in more rural locations. Innovative digital health care companies are helping healthcare reach more patients with more specificity and more affordability, which will improve outcomes and reduce everyone’s costs.

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "• Party vows to reconnect with public, strengthen grassroots presence • Preparing for upcoming elections with ‘renewed vigour’ Srinagar, Oct 24: People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday chaired a meeting of senior leaders here to review the party’s dismal performance in the recently concluded Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections and to strategise future actions. The party spokesperson said the principles and ideas on which the PDP was founded remain highly relevant. “We consider these principles the most appropriate remedy for the problems faced by Jammu and Kashmir. At the core of our mission is dialogue, and the current pervasive situation demands addressing the root cause,” he said. Regardless of electoral outcomes, the PDP has an essential role to play, he said, adding, “We will continue raising issues concerning the people and extend support to the government wherever our voice can contribute to securing the constitutional rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.” The PDP spokesperson said the party will draft detailed proposals to strengthen its grassroots presence and reconnect with the public. He further noted that the PDP is willing to support any party that shares its mission of safeguarding public rights. “Despite sustained assaults on the PDP, including a mass exodus of leaders, MLAs, and MLCs, this election has demonstrated that the PDP is here to stay,” he said. “We are committed to rebuilding, addressing our weaknesses from the recent polls, and expanding our worker base to ensure effective voter mobilisation in future elections.” During the meeting, the party said it is preparing for the upcoming municipal, panchayat and District Development Council (DDC) elections with “renewed vigour”. “Our well-structured grassroots network will be activated in line with the political vision of our founder, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,” the spokesperson said. The PDP also highlighted the potential of its younger members, many of whom have left established careers to join politics. “These young talents are crucial to the party’s future, and their political skills will be honed under the guidance of senior leaders,” he said. During the meeting, the party leadership reiterated its historical commitment to providing a credible democratic alternative. “The achievements of our brief tenures under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba Mufti—particularly in connectivity, opening routes across the Line of Control, education and health—continue to benefit the public. We will carry forward this legacy,” the party said. Recently elected MLAs – Mir Mohammad Fayaz, Waheed ur Rehman Para, Rafeeq Ahmed Naik – and all contesting candidates in recent elections attended the meeting. Senior leaders included Abdul Rehman Veeri, Dr Mehboob Beg, Sartaj Madni, Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura, Aseia Naqash, Zahoor Ahmad Mir, Sardar Amreek Singh Reen, Ab Gaffar Sofi, Adv Abdul Haq Khan and Imtiyaz Ahmad Shan and Khursheed Alam.",
