    "title": "VIDEO: Santa Barbara Novelty Wave Goes Nuts During Historic Dec. 28th Swell",
    "text": "In case you haven’t heard, California went absolutely bonkers on December 28th, 2023 with a swell that some were calling the “biggest day in years” at certain spots. Specifically, Mavericks, the Golden State’s premier big-wave surf spot located just south of San Francisco, stole the show during the swell with epic rides , heavy wipeouts , an historic first for alternative surf craft , and spectators swept away by a sneaker wave . But, of course, Mavs wasn’t the only place inundated with waves during the swell. Elsewhere was huge, too; and in some cases, almost too big. Take this mutant, massively crowded, endlessly entertaining to watch, wintertime novelty wave – which will remain nameless – from Santa Barbara. Backwash blasting surfers into oblivion, an unrelenting current that would turn Michael Phelps’ arms into noodles, and a few diamonds in the rough…that’s what we get in the edit above featuring the super secret, yet notoriously crowded, surf spot. This wave wasn’t the only Santa Barbara surf spot to light up during the swell, however. A couple clicks to the south, Rincon, the Queen of the Coast, was doing her thing as well. Check out the full photo gallery from that day here ; and here’s a report from local hero, Conner Coffin: “In all honesty, this is one of the biggest swells I’ve seen around here and it pretty much overloaded a lot of spots by mid day. I think every parking spot around was taken and everyone was on it. “It was one of the biggest and cleanest days I’ve surfed. It was packed in the morning but as the swell pulsed it cleared out.” *** Don't miss another headline from SURFER!

El joven se fue a disfrutar de una jornada lúdica en compañía de sus amigos, en la que ingirió alcohol, como solía hacer.\nAl despertar por la mañana, se encontraba mal y presentaba un cuadro de vómitos acompañados de sangre. Pensó que debía ser un problema de estómago, pero la sangre no cesaba tras devolver. Acompañado de sus amigos, que evitaban sentarse a su lado ante la grandes cantidades de este líquido que salía de su cuerpo, llamaron a una ambulancia, también motivados por los vecinos, alertados ante el estado en el que encontraron a Ivo en las escaleras.\nEl hombre fue trasladado al Hospital Universitario Clínico Oriental de Riga donde, tras las primeras pruebas, lo condujeron a otra sala. Allí permaneció aislado de los demás pacientes.\n“Tiene tuberculosis”, recuerda Ivo en palabras de los médicos. Una noticia muy dolorosa pero que, gracias a los facultativos, entendió que de no haber ingresado y actuado rápido, el final podría haber sido fatal.\n¡Mantente al día con El Huffpost!

    "title": "Why Amazon's CEO thinks the company's generative AI could be the next big thing",
    "text": "Amazon, which has maintained a relatively low profile in the field of generative artificial intelligence compared to Microsoft and Google, announced on Thursday that it is expanding its capacity to boost the technology globally and contribute to its democratisation. The world’s biggest e-commerce company said its cloud subsidiary Amazon Web Services will become an integral component of the future generative AI boom. “We are optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, said in his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday. Amazon’s share price jumped 1.67 per cent to close at $189.05 on Thursday. The company’s market capitalisation stood at $1.96 trillion. AWS revenue increased 13 per cent to $91 billion last year. Photo: AWS Generative AI technology was catapulted into the spotlight with ChatGPT, which was launched by Microsoft-backed OpenAI in December 2022. It is a programme that comes up with humanlike responses to prompts in seconds, based on information publicly available on the internet. However, its use and accuracy have come under scrutiny. In December, Alphabet-owned Google launched Gemini, which became the first AI model to beat human experts on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), one of the most widely used methods to test the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of the technology. Globally, AI investments are projected to hit $200 billion by 2025 and could possibly have a bigger impact on gross domestic product, Goldman Sachs Economic Research said in a report in August. Mr Jassy, who become the chief executive in 2021 after the company’s founder Jeff Bezos stepped down, said future generative AI opportunities are numerous. “Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud, and perhaps since the internet … the amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.” In his letter to shareholders, Mr Jassy indirectly criticised rivals’ AI models, saying Amazon offers models from various companies, such as Anthropic, Stability AI, Meta, Cohere as well as its own models, instead of relying solely on one dominant AI model. “Customers don’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications,” he added. Last year, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12 per cent yearly to $575 billion, while AWS revenue increased 13 per cent to $91 billion.
