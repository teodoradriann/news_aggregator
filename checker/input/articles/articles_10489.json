    "title": "Sister of woman charged with stabbing boyfriend 52 times returned to McLennan County",
    "text": "Sister of woman charged with stabbing boyfriend 52 times returned to McLennan County WACO, Texas (KWTX) - The sister of an Oklahoma woman charged with stabbing and slashing her estranged boyfriend 52 times in April 2023 was returned to McLennan County Wednesday, charged as an accomplice in the murder. Joann Arey Cometsevah, 34, remains in the McLennan County Jail under $1 million bond in the death of her sister’s estranged boyfriend, 44-year-old David Ralph Peeler. Cometsevah is charged with murder and tampering with evidence in Peeler’s death. Her sister, Leah Cecelia Breuer, 37, also is charged with murder and remains jailed under $500,000 bond. Breuer attempted to have her bond reduced at a hearing last week. However, 54th State District Judge Susan Kelly denied her request after determining she is a danger to society and a flight risk. Cometsevah was arrested last week in California on the McLennan County warrant. Peeler’s brother-in-law discovered his body on a deflated air mattress at the Village Square Apartments, 3500 Meyers Lane. He suffered multiple stab wounds to his torso, police said at the time. At Breuer’s hearing last week, Assistant District Attorney Ralph Strother argued against the bond reduction, telling the judge that Peeler was stabbed and slashed 52 times and declined to prosecute Breuer in a previous assault because he had feelings for her. He said the sisters are linked to the murder and authorities believe they put the murder weapon or weapons and other evidence in a dumpster at the Kate Ross Apartments. According to the tampering with physical evidence arrest affidavit against Cometsevah, Breuer told investigators in a taped interview that her sister took a knife from the scene. “At a later date, detectives spoke with a jail informant that was housed with Leah at the McLennan County Jail,” the affidavit states. “The jail informant advised that Leah also told said jail informant that the defendant (Cometsevah) had Leah assist the defendant in gathering the weapon by removing it from his neck, the victim’s phone and blood-soaked items from the scene and threw them in a garbage dumpster located near the Kate Ross Apartments, 937 S. 11th St.” An Uber driver who drove the sisters from the scene confirmed that she was asked to drop the sisters near the front of the apartment complex, according to the affidavit.

    "title": "Android 15 enfin dispo ! Quelles sont les nouveautés, comment l’installer ?",
    "text": "Après de longs mois d’attente, Android 15 est enfin là ! Google a annoncé, le 15 octobre, le déploiement de la dernière mise à jour de son système d’exploitation.\nEn effet, Google a dévoilé Android 15 le mercredi 15 octobre. Découvrez dans cet article les nouvelles fonctionnalités proposées, les smartphones compatibles et ce qu’il faut faire pour installer la MAJ.\nQuelles surprises Google nous a-t-il réservées avec Android 15 ?\nGoogle a décidé de frapper fort avec Android 15. L’une des grandes nouveautés est l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle pour lutter contre le vol de smartphones. Désormais, en cas de vol à l’arrachée, le téléphone se verrouille automatiquement, rendant l’appareil inutilisable.\nCe verrouillage instantané est activé dès que l’appareil détecte des mouvements suspects. Si cela ne suffit pas, vous pouvez verrouiller votre téléphone à distance en utilisant votre numéro.\nEt pour encore plus de sécurité, Android 15 complique l’accès aux paramètres sensibles. Toute tentative de réinitialisation du smartphone nécessite un code PIN ou une authentification biométrique.\nAprès plusieurs codes erronés, le téléphone se bloquera automatiquement, devenant inutilisable et difficilement revendable. Je trouve que cette fonctionnalité est pratique pour décourager les voleurs tout en protégeant vos données.\nGoogle a aussi introduit une fonctionnalité appelée Espace privé qui agit comme un véritable coffre-fort numérique. Ce dernier stocke vos applications sensibles comme celles liées aux réseaux sociaux, rencontres ou bancaires.\nCet espace privé peut être verrouillé et même complètement masqué de l’écran d’accueil, garantissant une discrétion totale. Ce nouvel outil offre ainsi un niveau de confidentialité encore jamais vu sur Android.\nQuoi d’autres ?\nAvec Android 15, Google a porté une attention particulière aux utilisateurs de smartphones pliables. Désormais, il est possible, tant sur les smartphones pliables que sur les tablettes, de fixer et de détacher la barre des tâches à l’écran.\nCette nouveauté, pratique et simple, améliore considérablement l’expérience multitâche en offrant la possibilité de personnaliser l’écran d’accueil et de sélectionner ses applications favorites.\nMais ce n’est pas tout ! Android 15 améliore aussi la qualité des photos prises dans des conditions de faible luminosité. Grâce à l’option “Boost en basse lumière”, vos clichés seront plus nets même dans l’obscurité.\nGoogle propose également une nouveauté que j’estime aussi plutôt intéressante : la messagerie par satellite. Désormais, les applications des opérateurs utilisent les réseaux satellitaires pour acheminer vos messages.\nCela signifie que vous pouvez envoyer et recevoir des messages où que vous soyez. Et ce, même dans une zone sans réseau mobile (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) ou sans Wi-Fi.\nAndroid 15 : quels smartphones sont compatibles ?\nComme à l’accoutumée, Google privilégie ses propres produits pour les premières mises à jour. Les récents smartphones de la gamme Pixel peuvent dorénavant accueillir Android 15.\nParmi ces smartphones figurent :\n- Google Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a,\n- Google Pixel Tablet\n- Google Pixel Fold\n- Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro\nGoogle Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro Fold\nLes constructeurs tels que Samsung, Xiaomi et OnePlus devraient suivre sous peu, en déployant la mise à jour sur leurs modèles phares. Patience donc pour les utilisateurs de ces marques, car l’attente ne devrait plus être très longue.\nSi vous possédez un Google Pixel compatible, l’installation d’Android 15 se fait en quelques étapes simples :\n- Rendez-vous dans les Paramètres de votre appareil.\n- Sélectionnez l’option Système.\n- Cliquez sur Mises à jour logicielles.\n- Appuyez sur Mise à jour (du) système pour lancer le processus.\nEt voilà, vous êtes prêt à explorer les nouveautés d’Android 15 sur votre appareil !\n- Partager l'article :",

    "text": "Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medallist Kagiyama Yuma earned the highest score in the men’s short program Thursday (16 January) at the Torino 2025 World University Winter Games.\nThe Japanese skater managd a season's best of 106.82, ahead of compatriot Sato Shun (96.30) and Italy's Daniel Grassl (93.82).\nKagiyama opened his program, set to The Sound of Silence, with a clean quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop combination. He followed it up with a quadruple Salchow that moved seamlessly into his sit spin.\nHis final jumping pass was a triple Axel, to the delight of coach and Olympic bronze medallist Carolina Kostner, who jumped for joy behind the boards.\nThe 2024-25 season has started strong for Kagiyama, 21, who won both of his Grand Prix assignments and finished runner-up at the Grand Prix Final to world champion Ilia Malinin of the United States.\nHe recently claimed his first-ever Japanese national title, a championship once held by his father. At the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, Kagiyama won silver medals in both the individual and team events.\nSato, 20, was last to skate Thursday and one of the few with the resume coming into the event to challenge Kagiyama for the top spot, having clinched the Cup of China Grand Prix earlier in the season. He delivered a clean program, jumping a quad toe, triple toe combination to open, followed by a quad Flip and a triple Axel, but came up short.\nIt was a much needed turn-around for Sato who finished a disappointing seventh at the recent Japanese nationals.\nFor 2022 European silver medallist Grassl, it was a season best score powered, in part, by a quadruple Lutz opening jump.\nThe men’s free skate at the World University Winter Games is set for Saturday (18 January).\nA winter wonder in Italy awaits! 🏂❄️🎿 Ticket-inclusive hospitality packages for the Olympic Winter Games in Italy go live on 6th February 2025! 🎫 Don't miss your chance to secure Milano Cortina 2026 tickets to the most sought-after sporting sessions paired with luxury service, accommodation, and more.\nWorld University Winter Games Torino 2025 - men's short program results, top 10\n- Kagiyama Yuma (JPN), 106.82\n- Sato Shun (JPN), 96.30\n- Daniel Grassl (ITA), 93.82\n- Shaidorov Mikhail (KAZ), 91.79\n- Cha Junhwan (KOR), 82.40\n- Yamamoto Sota (JPN), 78.81\n- Lee Sihyeong (KOR), 73.60\n- Corey Circelli (ITA), 70.48\n- Raffaele Francesco Zich (ITA), 69.66\n- Samy Hammi (FRA), 69.30",

    "text": "OAK HARBOR, Ohio (WTVG) - Protecting fish, wildlife, and plants was the goal of the Endangered Species Act. Now, 50 years later, Jason Lewis, refuge manager at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in Oak Harbor said the legislation passed in 1973 has had lasting effects protecting the local ecosystem here in Northwest Ohio.“In the 60s when we started having DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and other pesticides started having impacts on our species across the country. And in that 50 years we’ve had nearly 17,000 species that have been protected,” Lewis said. “It also provided as recovery responsibility; recovery actions have to be taken.”Lewis added that those actions can be seen today with the bald eagle population in Northwest Ohio.“1979 we had four nesting pairs in the whole state of Ohio, four nesting pairs, you fast forward to 2020, we had over 700 nesting pairs statewide,” Lewis said.The Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge plays host to 11,000 acres of land. Within that, there are over 200 species of birds including anywhere from 16-20 nesting pairs of bald eagles. In 2007, the bald eagle was delisted as an endangered species.Lewis added that it’s not just birds that have been protected since 1973. Plants have benefitted as well.“Here locally we have the Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid, Ottawa has, our high count here is over 2,000 Plants, so we’re one of the last remaining strongholds in the whole state of Ohio,” Lewis said.

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "#14 Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.\nTeniendo en cuenta el contexto, que vox es un partido de gente que ha demostrado tener poca capacidad de gestionar, que es un partido para hacer ruido en la oposición más que para gobernar (igual que podemos en este punto), y que esta crisis de los menores no es ni de lejos representativo del problema inmigratorio.\nPero hay que reconocer que esto es un gesto de honestidad que no recordamos en la política española. Renunciar a poltronas porque se han incumplido puntos que eran importantes para ellos desde el punto de vista de programa. Sobre cualquier otro partido (desde el PP a indepes o el psoe) hay cientos de ejemplos de lo contrario, de aferrarse al sillón y capear las preguntas con una desvergüenza acojonante.\nTodo por repartirse 300-400 niños entre 44 millones de españoles, niños que ya están en España (sí, Canarias, señor Abascal, es España y hay que ser solidaria con ella, que también hay españoles allí) y cosa que lleva haciéndose cada año. Ultra\"católicos\" negando el auxilio a niños. VAYA VAYA.\nEs que no dan para más. Ni honor ni pollas, es que son tontos. El \"honor\" es para las batallas, no para la política.\nMe arremango el fajín y apurandome el Cinzano promulgo:\n-Hay un movimiento divertido en la derecha, al crecer Vox, el PP se vio obligado a endurecer sus posturas mas escoradas para intentar recuperar los votos del ala mas reaccionaria que se iban desangrando pa Vox, eso es lo que vimos estos años, un \"a ver quien dice la idiotez mas gorda\". Esta semana asistimos a una nueva dinámica encabezada por el follaardillas, Vox ha visto como le crece un enano por la derecha, no puede permitirlo, o sea q se enfurruñan y se cierran en banda haciendo bandera de... pos algo tan propagandistico y de impacto entre el electorado mas ultra como los MENAS... (Aunque sea algo tan anecdótico como 21 personas, muchos niños, pa acoger en una comunidad como Castilla.... q lo pones en perspectiva y dices q cojones 21 personas no tienes donde meterlas en la españa vacia???? Esto no es \"problema\" esto es publicidad pa sus cafeteros) Con lo que puede ojo puede, que el PP vuelva a intentar pegar un giro hacia el centro (con el debilitamiento del ala dura del partido, Ayuso juapa, te miro a ti q ultimamente estas muy callada) y dejar que Vox y Alvise se maten a garrotazos a ver quien es mas y muy Ejpañó\nGolpe en la barra erupto, niño ponte una tapita aqui anda, que hay que darle culto al cuerpo",

    "text": "México confirma segundo caso humano de miasis por gusano barrenador: resurgen contagios en Chiapas\nUn hombre en Chiapas presenta el segundo caso confirmado en humanos por miasis, una infección provocada por el gusano barrenador.\nMéxico vuelve a encender las alertas sanitarias tras confirmarse el segundo caso humano de miasis por gusano barrenador. El paciente, un hombre de 50 años residente de Tuzantlán, Chiapas, fue diagnosticado tras presentar una infección cutánea severa días después de sufrir una mordedura de perro. La Secretaría de Salud federal activó protocolos de vigilancia epidemiológica para evitar la propagación de esta enfermedad parasitaria, que hasta hace poco se creía erradicada del país.\nEl gusano barrenador, conocido científicamente como Cochliomyia hominivorax, provoca miasis al depositar sus larvas en heridas abiertas, donde estas se alimentan del tejido vivo. Aunque la infección afecta comúnmente al ganado, su transmisión a humanos representa un riesgo emergente, especialmente en zonas rurales y con alta exposición al contacto animal.\nPUEDES VER:\n[‘Ya tienes precio’: diputada Ealy recibe amenaza de muerte por denunciar impunidad en caso Blanco”]\nMiasis en México: resurge una amenaza olvidada\nEl regreso de la miasis humana en México representa un retroceso en materia de salud pública, pues el país fue declarado libre del gusano barrenador en 1991. Sin embargo, en los últimos dos años, la Organización Mundial de Sanidad Animal (OMSA) reportó brotes en Panamá, Costa Rica, Nicaragua y el sur mexicano. El primer caso en humanos en México se registró en octubre de 2023, también en Chiapas. Con esta nueva confirmación, la preocupación sobre un resurgimiento sostenido cobra fuerza.\nLa mosca del gusano barrenador tiene la capacidad de reproducirse rápidamente en climas cálidos y húmedos. Sus larvas, una vez depositadas en heridas, generan inflamación, fiebre, dolor intenso y secreciones purulentas. Si no se detectan a tiempo, las consecuencias pueden escalar hasta la necrosis tisular o infecciones sistémicas. En el caso reciente, el paciente recibió atención médica oportuna y permanece en tratamiento con evolución favorable.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Confirman el primer caso humano de miasis por gusano barredor en México: ¿Cuáles son los síntomas?]\nZonas afectadas y respuesta sanitaria\nLos estados con mayor número de reportes por infestación en animales son Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche y Quintana Roo, donde se han confirmado al menos 369 focos activos desde mediados de 2023. La Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (SADER) mantiene un programa permanente de vigilancia sanitaria en el ganado, mediante inspecciones y tratamiento de lesiones sospechosas.\nA nivel local, autoridades de salud en Chiapas desplegaron brigadas médicas para informar a las comunidades sobre los síntomas de la miasis y reforzar medidas de higiene. También se instó a los veterinarios y médicos rurales a notificar inmediatamente cualquier caso sospechoso, tanto en humanos como en animales. La coordinación entre instituciones federales y estatales busca evitar una propagación que afecte tanto a la salud pública como a la economía agrícola.\nPUEDES VER:\n[William Levy tras su arresto en Florida: ''Voy a demandar a todos los medios que están difundiendo mentiras sobre mí'']\nPrevención y riesgos de la miasis por gusano barrenador\nPrevenir la miasis por gusano barrenador en humanos requiere atención a heridas, higiene constante y control de vectores. Las autoridades recomiendan lavar y cubrir adecuadamente cualquier lesión, evitar el contacto directo con animales callejeros y acudir al médico ante cualquier signo de infección. Aunque la miasis es una enfermedad controlable, su negligencia puede poner en riesgo la vida, especialmente en comunidades con acceso limitado a servicios médicos.",

    "text": "U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) is scrutinizing federal government agencies in Washington D.C. for allowing too many of their employees to work from home instead of showing up to the office.\n“Americans across the nation show up to work, in-person, every day while federal employees are consistently abusing work-from-home policies within their respective agencies,” Aderholt told Yellowhammer News Thursday. “Agencies with direct service to the public, like the Social Security Administration, are some of the biggest perpetrators of this abuse of the system. Some of these employees are even living in other states, while still receiving D.C. locality pay.”\nIn response to the problem, House Republicans are planning to\ndirect agencies to publicly post how many employees come to work in person in Washington.\nRELATED:\nGary Palmer wants federal employees to get back to work\nAderholt, who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, believes this is needed because it’s past time for these employees to “return to work.”\n“Federal agencies that provide direct service to the public must return to work to better serve the American people,” he said. “Telework should be judged solely on a case-by-case basis, not blanket policies.”\nThe directive would be a part of the would be included in the committee report that accompanies the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill.\n“The American people deserve a federal workforce that reflects the reality of showing up to work every day,: Aderholt added. “This is why abuse of telework across the federal government must end. I urge the Secretaries of these agencies to bring federal employees back to the workplace immediately so that the American people can be served in a way they deserve. Simply put, it’s time to get back to work. The rest of the country has, and it’s past time for our federal employees to do the same.”\nThe directive also includes an accounting of Education Department and Health and Human Services employees who receive Washington-area locality pay, but don’t frequently work in office.\nYaffee is a contributing writer to Yellowhammer News and hosts “The Yaffee Program” weekdays 9-11 a.m. on\nWVNN.

    "text": "EPA Employee Monitoring Intensifies with Badge and AI Tracking\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is increasing monitoring of its employees through badge tracking, AI, and data analysis to ensure compliance with in-office work directives. This move aligns with the Trump administration's technological initiatives for government efficiency, sparking concerns about privacy and professional autonomy.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is implementing new measures to monitor employee presence at the office, including tracking badge swipes, laptop logins, and additional data metrics. The initiative comes as the Trump administration continues to focus on technological solutions to enhance government operations.\nAn internal memo, revealed this week, indicates that employees are expected to comply with in-office directives or face potential disciplinary actions, including termination. This follows the rescission of remote-work agreements on February 12. AI applications for monitoring were referenced, but the EPA clarified it is not using these technologies for direct personnel decisions.\nWhile the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not adopted similar tracking measures, the EPA's actions reflect a broader trend of monitoring under Elon Musk's influence, according to sources. As debates continue over privacy and employment rights, the question of how technology and government employee relations will coexist remains at the forefront.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
