    "title": "In weight loss battle, Novo and Lilly face growing offensive from licenced copies - MarketScreener",
    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly expand sales of their popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, cheaper copies of their patented remedies are winning approval from some regulators overseas, posing a threat to the pharma giants' prices and market share.\nSince Novo's blockbuster Ozempic diabetes treatment was approved in the United States in 2017, regulators have greenlighted 22 medicines containing its main ingredient in Bangladesh, Laos, Russia and Paraguay as well as seven copies of Lilly's rival drugs in Bangladesh, according to a Reuters review.\nOzempic's patented semaglutide ingredient is also used in Novo's wildly popular obesity treatment Wegovy and diabetes tablets Rybelsus, while Lilly's tirzepatide is used in Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nThis year, at least seven new products containing semaglutide have been approved for sale in Laos and Russia, according to public lists of licenced drugs, comments from a regulatory official, details of two approved medicines in Paraguay obtained via a freedom of information request, and information on the websites of two drug manufacturers.\nAsked for efficacy data on the licenced analogue versions, regulators in Bangladesh, Paraguay and Russia did not respond. Davone Duangdany, director of the drug and medical device control division within the Laos health ministry, told Reuters that such information was confidential.\nRegulators in Bangladesh, Laos and Russia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments on the rigor of their systems to approve, develop, manufacture and distribute drugs.\n\"What I can tell you on behalf of the institution is that the highest and most demanding standards have been taken into account for (the two Paraguay medicines) approval, as we would do for any other product,\" Jorge Lliou, head of Paraguay's National Directorate of Health Surveillance, told Reuters in response to a query about the origin of the active ingredient in the locally approved drugs.\nThe growing number of licenced copies could depress prices for anti-obesity medicines and risk a spillover effect into important markets such as India, where Novo's Rybelsus has already been launched, three pharma experts said.\nAnna Kemp-Casey, a medical policy specialist at the University of South Australia, said prices for Novo's and Lilly's weight-loss drugs would initially remain supported as strong demand currently far outstrips supplies.\nBut \"in the longer term it is likely that all this competition will put downward price pressure\" on Lilly and Novo in India and other countries, she added.\nBoth drugmakers are racing to increase manufacturing capacity to meet unprecedented demand. More than a billion people globally are considered obese, a condition linked to various significant health complications. BMO Capital Markets has estimated annual weight-loss drug sales reaching $150 billion by 2033.\nThe proliferation of copies could ultimately undermine revenue for Lilly and Novo, whose shares have soared on robust demand for new weight-loss tablets and injector pens containing substances that mimic the activity of a hormone that slows digestion and helps people feel full for longer.\nThe Reuters review focused on countries where there is no Novo patent on semaglutide, that enjoy patent exemptions from World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules due to their status of developing economies, or where, like in Russia, there are local decrees that override such international regulations.\n\"The approval of generics by less-stringent regulatory agencies provides a legal framework for local manufacturers to produce these drugs for both domestic use and export,\" said Enrique Seoane-Vazquez, a pharmaceutical policy specialist at Chapman University in California.\nOzempic, which was developed to fight diabetes but reached global popularity thanks to its weight-loss side effect, has become a significant revenue driver for Novo, with sales reaching 95.7 billion Danish crowns ($13.5 billion) in 2023. Sales of Lilly's Mounjaro reached $5.1 billion last year.\nAsked about the copies identified by Reuters, Eli Lilly said tirzepatide was a complex macromolecule that required rigorous testing.\n\"Any policies for approval of biosimilar products...present significant patient safety concerns. Regulators should proceed carefully, with patient safety at the forefront,\" Lilly said in a written statement.\nApproached by Reuters, a spokeswoman for Novo declined to comment on potential risks of price competition from copies from Bangladesh, Laos, Russia and Paraguay.\nAsked whether Novo was planning to apply for a patent in Paraguay, which does not enjoy an exemption because it does not meet the WTO criteria, the spokeswoman said the Danish company does not seek patent protection in every country worldwide.\nReuters has earlier reported that two copies of Novo's weight- loss and diabetes drugs, Orsema and Fitaro, had been approved in Bangladesh. Some of the injector pens were seized at the border in a wealthier country where Ozempic's patent is protected, the UK, the same report showed.\nNovo's patent on semaglutide expires in 2031 in Japan and Europe and in 2032 in the United States, but as early as 2026 in China and India, according to the company's latest annual report and industry experts. Lilly said in its annual report its tirzepatide patent runs out in 2036 in the United States, and later in other major economies.\nRACE TO THE BOTTOM\nThe approved copies identified by the Reuters review tend to be much cheaper than the originals.\nIn Russia, for example, a month's supply of Semavic, used for diabetes and containing semaglutide, costs 4,420.20 Russian rubles ($42.76), according to local manufacturer Geropharm. That was 24% lower than the cost of a month's supply of Ozempic in Russia, Geropharm told Reuters.\nIn Bangladesh, a pack of Incepta Pharmaceutical's Orsema is priced at 350 or 600 Bangladesh taka ($3 or $5), according to local online medicine information directory Medex.\nIn the United States, however, a month's supply of Ozempic had a U.S. list price of $935.77 in September, while the weekly injection costs around $100 for each 3mL dose through China's public hospital network.\nNovo has not launched Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus in Bangladesh, a Novo spokesperson told Reuters.\nDue to its affordability, Semavic is appealing to potential customers abroad.\n\"We have noticed increased interest in the medication not only in Russia but also from foreign partners and colleagues, with inquiries ranging from (a group of former Soviet republics) to Latin America,\" Geropharm said in response to Reuters queries about overseas exports of Semavic.\nChirantan Chatterjee, an economist at the University of Sussex in Britain, said the growing significance of the obesity problem may also spur regulators in parts of Asia to ask Big Pharma to lower prices.\n\"The direction of travel is therefore more competition, lower prices, enhanced choices, and consumer welfare expansion in this area,\" Chatterjee said.\n($1 = 7.0952 Danish crowns)\n(Reporting by Andrew Silver; Additional reporting from Gleb Stolyarov in Tbilisi, Daniela Desantis in Asuncion, Ruma Paul in Dhaka; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Lisa Jucca)\nBy Andrew Silver\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "By Alex Arger ,\n22 hours ago LL Flooring, the company formerly known as Lumber Liquidators, is closing 94 stores after filing for bankruptcy.\nThe Richmond, Virginia-based company announced Sunday it had entered Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings in Delaware bankruptcy court with the hope of selling the business in the next few weeks, as it says it's in \"active negotiations with multiple bidders.\"\nAnd thanks to more than $130 million in debtor-in-possession financing, LL Flooring will be able to keep open more than 300 stores and its online platform during the Chapter 11 process, with the select 94 stores holding closing sales. The 30-year-old company said it didn't plan to close additional stores through the reorganization but would continue to evaluate its footprint \"as appropriate.\"\nRELATED STORY | Americans cutting back spending on nonessential items at major retailers\n\"After comprehensive efforts to enhance our liquidity position in a challenging macro environment, a determination was made that initiating this Chapter 11 process is the best path forward for the company,\" Charles Tyson, president and CEO of LL Flooring, said in a statement. \"Today's step is intended to provide LL Flooring with additional time and financial flexibility as we reduce our physical footprint and close certain stores while pursuing a going-concern sale of the rest of our business.\"\nLL Flooring is now the latest retailer to shutter as inflation-weary consumers have pulled back on big-ticket purchases, including homes. And with fewer home purchases, fewer people are itching to spend on renovation projects, like redoing their flooring, leaving LL Flooring with slowed sales and less revenue.\nOther companies that have taken a hit in recent months include Big Lots, which also announced this month it would be closing more than 300 locations in the U.S. after warning it could be closing for good overall. Earlier this year, 99 Cents Only Stores announced it would be liquidating and closing all of its locations, and Conn's HomePlus is closing all of its stores after recently filing for bankruptcy.\nRELATED STORY | Big Lots set to close hundreds of stores nationwide\nExpress, rue21, Z Gallerie, Red Lobster, Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens , Family Dollar and Best Buy are among the slew of other retailers that have either announced bankruptcy filings or store closures in recent times.\nBut beyond market pressure, LL Flooring has been subject to a number of controversies in the last decade.\nIn 2015, a \"60 Minutes\" report uncovered unsafe levels of formaldehyde in LL Flooring's Chinese-made laminate flooring, which led to its stock losing almost half its value and numerous customer class-action lawsuits. And in the same year, it pleaded guilty in federal court to illegally importing hardwood flooring, and was ordered to pay $13.15 million in penalties.\nLL Flooring customers will now only have until Sept. 3 to use gift cards at the remaining stores.

    "text": "Prabowo Sends Indonesian Navy Hospital Ship on Humanitarian Voyage to Gaza Jakarta. Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, along with the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy Admiral Muhammad Ali, dispatched the Indonesian Navy Hospital Ship KRI dr Radjiman Wedyoningrat-992 for a humanitarian/port visit voyage to Gaza via Egypt on Thursday. Prabowo, who is also a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, conveyed President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo's greetings to the humanitarian task force departing to Egypt and Gaza. Prabowo expressed concern for the immense suffering experienced by the people of Gaza due to attacks from the Israeli government that violate humanitarian norms and disregard international law. \"I commend those of you who will carry out this task. Although we are not a country involved in the conflict, we feel bound by solidarity and humanitarian responsibility to our brothers and sisters in Palestine,\" said Prabowo during the departure ceremony that took place at a military dock in Jakarta. Prabowo also emphasized the importance of solidarity and vigilance in executing this humanitarian mission. \"I am confident that the task force commander and the ship commander will provide excellent leadership. Your training level, discipline, and spirit will ensure success in completing this mission,\" he said. \"Remember, you represent the entire Indonesian nation. Uphold the honor of this nation, the honor of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI), and the honor of the Navy that we are proud of and beloved by the entire Indonesian people. May KRI dr Radjiman Wedyoningrat-992 and its entire crew be protected by Allah SWT,\" Prabowo concluded his speech. The journey is expected to take approximately 52 days. The humanitarian aid distributed includes food items, blankets, clothing, baby supplies, women's clothing, milk, field tents, hygiene kits, mineral water, worship accessories, and more. The event was attended by various dignitaries, including the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense, the Commander of the First Fleet Command, the Rector of the National Defense University, the Commander of the Indonesian Navy Hydro-Oceanographic Center, and other high-ranking officials. Over 100 days have passed since the onset of the violent conflict in Gaza on Oct. 7. The Gaza Health Ministry has recently documented a minimum of 23,968 Palestinian casualties since the commencement of the conflict. This war has prompted global demonstrations, including solidarity rallies in Indonesia. Indonesia, which chaired the ASEAN grouping last year, has consistently taken a pro-Palestinian stance. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi is scheduled to address the International Court of Justice (ICJ) next month, focusing on the Israeli occupation in Palestine.

So back then, I think it was like $1-$1.50. So that was the highlight of my day back then,\" Bui recalled. He became a loyal customer, eventually taking his kids to the beloved Chinese bakery. Back in 2022, like other fans of Keefer Court, Bui was saddened to hear it would be closing at the end of the year. After nearly 40 years, the Kwan family decided it was time to say goodbye. Bui said prior to that, he knew [Asia Mall](/article/news/local/kare11-sunrise/asia-mall-eden-prairie-opens-to-public/89-f5b34166-d7e2-43f2-a7a4-55d75070701b) was looking for a bakery to move into the space in Eden Prairie. \"I approached them about three years ago about opening at the mall, but I think... they wanted to retire and move on,\" Bui said about Sunny and Paulina. Their daughter, Michelle, also realized it wouldn't be sustainable for her to carry it on. But Bui was later able to work out a deal to buy Keefer Court and all its recipes. He then spent 14 months with his wife and business partner, discovering all the elements they wanted to include in their bakery. They traveled across the United States looking at the best bakeries. \"That's where it took us over a year to build this out. We really wanted just to build it right the first time and we believe we have the most beautiful bakery in America,\" Bui said. Thursday morning, a line had formed outside the new Keefer Court in Asia Mall for the soft opening. \"I've always enjoyed Keefer Court. I've been in the Twin Cities for over 35 years and when they closed I was so disappointed,\" said Jane Chao, who waited in line for the soft opening. \"You can see in the line, I thought I got here early... I know that this place is very, very missed. So it's great that they've re-opened.\" The Kwan family was also there on opening day, helping customers pick out their Hong Kong-style pastries. They are helping the new team in the beginning. Sunny even recognized many loyal customers in line. \"I've been looking for somebody who can carry on the legacy. But I have to make sure the new owner... can do that,\" Sunny said. \"Michael is a good fit.\" On Thursday, Sunny was helping in the back of the house. \"Make sure the product passes my inspection before they go out,\" Sunny said, laughing. \"All the pastries are from the original recipe. What we brought in is Vietnamese desserts, and sticky rice, and our own pandan cakes,\" Bui said. \"So we're super excited for the combination of Chinese pastries with Vietnamese desserts.\" Bui said they traveled the whole country and couldn't find a restaurant or bakery that offered those two items together. As one customer left, she said, \"The joy is abundant. Have you seen the turnout?\" Keefer Court will be open through Sunday. They will then take a break to regroup and go over what went well and what could be improved. The goal is to have their grand opening on Saturday, March 23.",

    "text": "The number of suicides in our state has reached 200 this year, when a man hanged himself at his home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood in Peto, Yucatan. A 30-year-old man hanged himself at his home on 45th Street in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood of the town of Peto, bringing the number of suicides this year to 200. Relatives of the victim, identified with the initials VPG, 30 years old, made the report to the Police at 6:00 p.m. It was learned that he was the father of the young man suspended from a mango tree in the patio of the house. Agents of the Municipal Police, Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) came to verify the report and although emergency medical technicians also arrived, but they could do nothing. The presence of the public security officers caught the attention of locals, who still did not know what had happened. Among the residents of the area it was mentioned that the now deceased was appreciated, hardworking and was friendly to neighbors and friends. The place where the discovery was recorded remained guarded by municipal police, awaiting the arrival of representatives of the State Attorney General’s Office (FGE), as well as personnel from the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) to take charge of removing the body for the autopsy. Of law. During 2023, the Yucatecan authorities reported a total of 95 cases of attempted suicide, which places the State as the leader in the Peninsula in that area. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, until July 15, 2023 in Mexico there were 3,571 notifications of attempted suicide; Jalisco was the most affected by this problem, accumulating 586 cases. In the case of the Yucatán Peninsula, together the three states accumulate 189 incidents, of which 50 percent were in Yucatán. The other half is divided between the 49 cases reported by Quintana Roo and the 45 from Campeche. The National Epidemiological Bulletin also suggests that, in Yucatán, women are the ones who have committed the most suicide attempts, with 70 of the total cases reported by federal authorities. The document also indicates that during the current year, 16 people with suicidal ideas have been diagnosed in Yucatán, double the eight reported in Campeche and much more than the only one in Quintana Roo. Likewise, the Ministry of Health points out that during 2023 other people have caused injuries that are alarmingly reported, although they are not classified as a suicide attempt. For example, in the first six and a half months of the year, in Yucatán, nine injured themselves with sharp objects, seven poisoned themselves with non-narcotic pain relievers, four attempted poisoning with prescription drugs, and nine intentionally injured themselves by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation.
