    "text": "Déjà quatre fois plus d’enfants blessés en trottinette électrique\nLa moitié n’avaient pas l’âge légal de 14 ans et ne portaient pas de casque\nLe nombre d’enfants blessés en trottinette électrique a déjà quadruplé depuis le début de l’année et la moitié des victimes n’avaient pas l’âge légal et ne portaient pas de casque, s’inquiète un hôpital de Montréal.\nVingt-sept enfants ont dû être soignés à l’hôpital de Montréal pour enfants (CUSM) pour une blessure en trottinette électrique depuis le début de la saison. C’est pratiquement quatre fois plus qu’à pareille date l’an dernier (sept blessés).\nTraumatismes crâniens ou faciaux, fractures, entorses, dents cassées, lacérations: les blessures peuvent être graves.\n«C’est une grande augmentation, s’inquiète Liane Fransblow, coordonnatrice de la traumatologie à l’hôpital de Montréal pour enfants. Il y a des blessures sévères au cerveau qui peuvent avoir des séquelles.»\nAutre fait inquiétant: la moitié des petites victimes n’avaient pas l’âge légal de 14 ans pour circuler en trottinette électrique et 50% ne portaient pas le casque, qui est pourtant obligatoire.\n«Je pense que la population ne connaît pas la loi. Il n’y a pas assez d’information», croit Mme Fransblow.\nDe son côté, l'hôpital Sainte-Justine a recensé une quinzaine d’enfants blessés en 2024, un chiffre en augmentation. Là-bas aussi, près de la moitié ne portaient pas de casque.\n«On en voit beaucoup, constate la Dre Marianne Beaudin, cheffe de traumatologie. Ça reste un moyen de transport dangereux.»\nCette dernière encourage les jeunes à rester sur les pistes cyclables pour éviter les risques de collision avec les voitures. L’an dernier, un jeune montréalais de 14 ans avait perdu la vie en traversant la rue.\nLa trottinette électrique est très populaire sur les routes depuis qu'elle a été légalisée, en 2023.\nMoins sécuritaire qu’à vélo\nSelon l’organisme Vélo Québec, elle est beaucoup moins sécuritaire qu’une bicyclette.\n«Il n’y a pas les mêmes points d’appui, c’est beaucoup plus facile d’être déstabilisé, explique Magali Bebronne, la directrice des programmes. Ce n’est pas un jouet. [...] Il y a une perception erronée que c’est sécuritaire et que les enfants sont aptes.»\nPuisque les roues de la trottinette sont petites, la chaussée cahoteuse cause beaucoup des chutes. Et souvent, le visage, la tête ou les bras absorbent le choc.\nL’hôpital pour enfants demande que l’âge minimum pour utiliser la trottinette électrique soit rehaussé à 16 ans, comme dans la plupart des provinces canadiennes.\nÀ Québec, le phénomène des trottinettes électriques ne se répercute pas encore dans les urgences pédiatriques. Les enfants se blessent davantage en VTT ou en vélo, note le Dr Pierre-Alexandre Leblanc, urgentologue au CHU de Québec.",

    "title": "How kiosks can help SMBs overcome labor challenges",
    "text": "In an era marked by convenience, personalization and evolving consumer expectations, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) must stay innovative. This includes on-site technology, too, especially as staffing challenges persist in retail, hospitality and many other sectors. In fact, the\nNational Federation of Independent Business reported that 57% of small business owners hiring, or trying to hire, in January found few to no qualified applicants. Without more support, existing staff may become stretched thin or simply unable to handle certain tasks.\nSelf-service kiosks have emerged as a game-changer for SMBs striving to maintain operational efficiency and consistency. Self-service kiosks are more than just automated terminals — they are a strategic tool that can help SMBs thrive by optimizing time and resources. Not only do they reduce wait times during busy hours, but they also empower businesses to maximize the productivity of their existing workforce. Here’s how.\nKiosks free up time for more critical employee tasks\nOne of the key advantages of deploying self-service kiosks is that they liberate employees from mundane, repetitive tasks that consume a lot of time. This creates opportunities to channel customer service efforts towards more essential or value-added responsibilities.\nIn quick-serve and fast-casual\nrestaurants, for example, digital kiosks allow guests to take their time perusing the menu and order exactly what they want without feeling rushed or pressured. Meanwhile, staff can be reallocated to preparing food, cleaning and other routine tasks on the shift checklist.\nIn\nhotels, employees can shift their focus from routine check-ins to next-level service. With self-service kiosks efficiently managing the transactional side of the business, staff can elevate the overall brand experience through personalized interactions, attentive service and swift issue resolution.\nSimilarly, in\nretail, the implementation of self-service kiosks allows employees to move beyond the confines of the checkout counter. They can dedicate more time to restocking shelves, conducting inventory assessments and engaging with customers. This human-centric approach not only enhances the overall customer experience but also positions employees as brand ambassadors, capable of delivering a level of service that goes beyond transactional exchanges.\nHappier employees lead to better customer experiences\nAs small businesses grapple with labor shortages, a modern checkout device helps foster employee satisfaction and safeguard customer experiences. A small business kiosk is not merely a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic investment in the well-being of a business — and its people.\nThe future of retail is digital\nGet your free guide to growing your retail business by adopting future-proof ecommerce technology.\n<a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/business/short-form/the-future-of-retail-is-digital/?cid=com-btb-sky-blg-us-other-na-100219-112001-na-na-na&CampaignCode=blog-art-wp\">\nDownload Now </a>\nSelf-service kiosks empower customers to customize their orders at their own pace, fostering a sense of control and personalization. In the restaurant business, convenience often translates to more frequent visits, and therefore, more sales. The same is true in retail, with efficient checkouts through kiosks translating into\nhigher overall customer satisfaction rates.\nAs self-service kiosks shoulder transactional responsibilities, the employee experience, too, is improved. Staff can engage in more fulfilling tasks, creating a positive work environment — and happier employees are statistically proven to improve customer experiences. Even prior to 2020, when we saw excess needs for better customer satisfaction, there was evidence of it being a result of a positive workforce. A\nGlassdoor study found that having a more satisfied workforce is associated with companies’ ability to deliver better customer satisfaction, especially in the retail, food service, travel and tourism, financial services and healthcare sectors. In these industries, a one-star improvement in a company’s overall Glassdoor rating predicted a 3.2-point higher customer satisfaction score.\nKiosks are easy to install\nFor SMBs challenged with labor shortages,\nSamsung Kiosk is an effective and easy-to-install solution that can be quickly integrated into almost any setup or operation. With built-in Tizen or Windows 10 IoT Enterprise OS, the kiosk is compatible with various third-party devices, content management systems and POS software. It also offers several customer payment options including credit card, barcode, QR code, and NFC, plus a built-in printer.\nAll of this is packed into a compact modular design that comes in three installation types — countertop, floor stand and wall-mounting. No external PC is needed, and its sleek gray-white color blends perfectly into any business setting for a stylish, modern look, further helped by a hidden power strip and cabling.\nTraining costs and time are reduced\nUnlike the extended training periods required for new hires, self-service kiosks are ready for deployment upon installation, which contributes to the overall operational agility and profitability of the business.\nTraditional training processes incur costs not only in terms of training materials and resources but also in time spent by experienced staff showing new hires the ropes. With self-service kiosks, the learning curve is flattened. This reduction in training time directly translates to cost savings, a crucial factor for SMBs operating on constrained budgets.\nKiosks also provide a consistent level of service and efficiency, regardless of staff turnover. This is particularly advantageous in industries where frequent turnover has the potential to result in variations in service quality. With a kiosk handling routine transactions, businesses can ensure a uniform and reliable customer experience across all locations.\nA dependable SMB partner\nIn the face of labor shortages, SMBs can depend on self-service kiosks to fill the gaps. Not only do they free up employees to perform more critical, customer-centric tasks, but they also create tangible ways for businesses to reduce costs and work smarter, not harder. With kiosks — which never call in sick or miss an upsell opportunity — SMBs can allocate resources more efficiently while delivering elevated customer experiences.\nLearn\nhow self-service kiosks improve employee satisfaction and efficiency.

    "text": "Israel used a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly U.N. school strike in Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel, and NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military made improper use of a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly airstrike Thursday on a United Nations school compound in Gaza, according to current and former U.S. defense officials who analyzed an image of the bomb remnants documented by NPR at the site. The munition used was a GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, according to a Pentagon official and a former U.S. Air Force official. It is the same kind of bomb, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-rafah-bombs.html) The New York Times, that Israel used in an airstrike last month that killed dozens of displaced civilians at a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, an incident Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu called](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/27/nx-s1-4982787/israeli-strike-kills-dozens-45-in-an-area-of-rafah-that-didnt-get-evacuation-orders) a “tragic mishap.” Israel’s army said it was targeting a group of militants inside two classrooms at a U.N. school in Nuseirat, a central Gaza refugee camp. But the 2 a.m. strike killed at least 32 people, including seven children, according to Dr. Khalil Doqran, director of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza. Families displaced in the war are sheltering in the school. At the hospital morgue, NPR documented one body bag labeled as containing the body parts of five children. The Israeli army said the militants it was targeting had participated in the deadly Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel and were plotting attacks from inside the school. Army spokesman Peter Lerner said the military called off the strike twice to minimize collateral damage, and that he was unaware of any civilian casualties in the strike. The Pentagon official told NPR that Israel had used the bomb improperly because the bomb is intended to cause low collateral damage but caused a high number of casualties. “Israel is using the most advanced, precise and effective bombs the U.S. produces like a cudgel,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Israel’s conduct. Wes Bryant, the former Air Force official, said the U.S. military would have most likely called off such a strike where militants were holed up in a U.N. school housing displaced civilians because the estimated number of civilian casualties would be high. “What strikes me most about these most recent strikes by the IDF [Israeli military], in which large numbers of civilians have again been killed, is that they are using munitions intended to be both precision and low collateral damage — but they are not employing them in a manner in which those qualities are applied,” said Bryant, a retired master sergeant and former special operations joint terminal attack controller in the elite special warfare branch of the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. State Department called on Israel to name those killed in the strike. The Israeli military declined NPR's request for comment on the kind of munitions used, but identified the names of nine men it said were militants killed in the strike. The U.N. school in Nuseirat is sheltering families that had been displaced multiple times: those who fled north Gaza to Rafah in south Gaza at the start of the war, and who then fled Israel’s offensive on Rafah to the U.N. school. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said the school compound is sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the moment. “Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,” he [said in a statement](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1798681289052283206) on the social media platform X. One family had reached the school two weeks ago and was killed while they were sleeping, relatives told NPR. In the aftermath of the strike, rubble covered the school courtyard and blood covered the school staircase. Two boys with head and leg injuries remained in the school compound. Children were collecting wood from among the rubble to use as firewood, and U.N. officials were trying to repair a door and windows of the compound for families still sheltering there. At the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital morgue, a mother grieved over her dead son’s body. The hospital director said more than 140 people have been killed since Wednesday in central Gaza as Israel launched a new offensive in the area. “The scene inside the emergency room inside Al-Aqsa Hospital is even worse than yesterday. They have no chance to reorganize from ... yesterday’s events, and now they are struck with mass casualties after mass casualties,” said Karin Huster, a medical adviser for humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, who is at the hospital. “Patients are on the floor. There is blood everywhere ... dead bodies are not being taken to the morgue because the facility is overwhelmed.” NPR's Daniel Estrin reported from Tel Aviv; NPR producer Anas Baba reported from Gaza.

    "title": "Biden's Bold Ukraine Stance in SOTU Wins Europe's Heart, Gaza Strategy Stirs Debate",
    "text": "During his recent State of the Union (SOTU) address, President Joe Biden pledged unwavering support for\nUkraine and proposed a novel approach to delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, sparking diverse reactions globally. This strategic move has placed Biden at the forefront of international diplomacy, showcasing a robust blueprint for America's foreign policy engagements amidst escalating global conflicts.\nUnyielding Support for Ukraine\nBiden's commitment to Ukraine was palpable as he urged Congress to break the deadlock and greenlight additional military aid. His emphasis on NATO's unity and expansion, coupled with a veiled critique of Trump's foreign policy, underscored a clear message: the U.S. will not waver in its support for Kyiv against Russian aggression. This stance not only reaffirms America's dedication to democracy and freedom but also signals to Europe that the U.S. remains a steadfast ally in the face of geopolitical upheavals.\nNavigating the Israel-Hamas Conflict\nAddressing the complex Israel-Hamas war, President Biden announced the construction of a temporary pier in Gaza for humanitarian aid delivery, a move that reflects a nuanced understanding of the conflict's intricacies. While advocating for the protection of civilian lives, Biden's speech stopped short of demanding an immediate ceasefire, instead proposing a six-week truce. This careful balancing act highlights the challenges of aligning U.S. military support with diplomatic efforts to mitigate civilian suffering in conflict zones.\nGlobal Reactions and the Road Ahead\nThe reactions to Biden's SOTU address paint a picture of cautious optimism and concern. European allies have expressed relief at America's reaffirmed commitment to Ukraine, viewing it as a signal of enduring transatlantic solidarity. Conversely, the proposed Gaza pier project has sparked debate over its potential to shift U.S. policy dynamics in the Middle East. As Biden navigates these complex geopolitical landscapes, the world watches closely, hoping for diplomatic breakthroughs that can pave the way for peace and stability.\nPresident Biden's SOTU address marks a significant moment in U.S. foreign policy, demonstrating a commitment to proactive engagement in global affairs. By taking a strong stand on Ukraine and proposing innovative solutions for Gaza, Biden has set the stage for a year of diplomatic challenges and opportunities. As these strategies unfold, their impact on international relations and global peace efforts will undoubtedly remain a focal point of discussion and analysis.",

    "text": "Kadarius Toney already seemed like one of the worst trades the Kansas City Chiefs have made in years. He added to that narrative at the team’s practice on Wednesday.\nWhen the Chiefs made a trade deadline move for former Giants first-round pick Kadarius Toney in 2022, the deal was viewed as a steal. They gave up a third-round compensatory and sixth-round selection in 2023 for a player with a great deal of potential. But there were red flags as well.\nRelated: Kansas City Chiefs 2024 schedule, latest depth chart, stats and injury report\nThe Giants gave up on him after just a season and a half and the former Seminoles star also had issues staying healthy. The Chiefs have also found out that he can be inconsistent on the field and a bit of a problem off.\nHe made headlines in 2023 when superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes got publicly frustrated with Toney’s butter fingers during an important game in December that led to a turnover against the Patriots. Then a random tangent on social media about the team in January led to him being a surprising scratch in their AFC Title Game matchup with the Baltimore Ravens.\nEven during a season where the Kansas City Chiefs desperately needed a secondary receiving option, besides Travis Kelce, he could not elevate his game and was given just two starts in 2023. Toney is on a path to being a major draft bust from the 2021 NFL Draft.\nKadarius Toney stats (2024): 13 games, 27 catches, 169 yards, 1 touchdown\nGittin’ CHIPPY 😬\nGeorge Karlaftis lays out Kadarius Toney after a play and Travis Kelce has some words for him 👀 pic.twitter.com/CZLk04YSPk\n— KC Sports Network (@KCSportsNetwork) July 24, 2024 He only added to the narrative that he is a disappointment and one of the worst trades the team has made on Wednesday at their first practice of training camp. After taking a pass from Mahomes, Toney took a solid shot from defensive star George Karlaftis that knocked him to the ground.\nInstead of taking the moment in stride and realizing he is on thin ice after three underwhelming seasons in the league, Toney got up and violently threw the ball at Karlaftis. The receiver walked off the field while some players from the offense and defense jaw-jacked after the play.\nKadarius Toney could turn into a big part of a Kansas City Chiefs three-peat in 2024. However, it seems like he is still the player he has always been, and that is not a good sign for KC.\nRelated: Kansas City Chiefs turned down chance to sign 2x Pro Bowl receiver last season",
