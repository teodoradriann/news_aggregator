    "text": "A NSW berry farm has grown the world's heaviest blueberry. Weighing 20.40 grams and measuring 39.31 millimetres, the fruit has officially broken the [Guinness World Record title](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-blueberry) set in 2020 by a 16.20 gram Western Australian blueberry. The record-breaking blueberry was picked at Costa Berries' farm in Corindi, on the Mid North Coast, in November 2023 and grown by Brad Hocking, Jessica Scalzo and Marie-France Courtois. Mr Hocking said the blueberry was from the Eterna variety which is known for its large fruit size, crisp texture and long shelf life. \"When we picked this one there were probably around 20 other berries of a similar size,\" he said. \"This really is a delightful piece of fruit. \"While the fruit is large, there's absolutely no compromise on quality or flavour as would be expected when developing a premium variety blueberry.\" The Costa Group said its variety improvement program develops one or two new varieties of blueberries on average each year. It licenses Costa bred varieties overseas such as the Americas, Morocco, China and south east Africa. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data.

    "text": "Pakistan’s 2024 election, held on February 8 after two years of political turmoil and a months-long delay, was both marred and hopeful. Here’s what to know about the run-up to the election, election day, and where the country stands now. Before election day: Pre-poll manipulation This election had been expected to yield a clear winner: former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had returned from four years of exile in London last October. Before the election, Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party (PML-N) was favored by the military, and the scales had been tipped heavily in its favor. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, whom the military had backed until he was ousted from office in April 2022, has been in prison since August 2023 and was disqualified from running for office this election cycle. Khan was sentenced the week before the election to decades in prison in three separate cases, on charges ranging from leaking state secrets to unlawful marriage. More damaging, Pakistan’s Supreme Court [stripped](https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-pti-barred-from-using-cricket-bat-electoral-symbol-/7439552.html) Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), of its election symbol in January. Neither the party name nor its iconic election symbol, the cricket bat (signifying Khan’s past as the star captain of Pakistan’s cricket team), were on the ballots, and all the party’s candidates had to run as independents. Election symbols are of paramount importance in Pakistan, where about 40 percent of the population is illiterate. The decision had other implications as well: A party without a symbol cannot claim seats reserved for women and minorities, and its candidates could be poached after the election. The ruling came on top of an intense state crackdown on the PTI in the past year, with thousands of party members jailed and almost all its senior leadership pressured to quit politics. The party also saw a media blackout and restrictions on campaigning in the run-up to the election. Thus, the day before the election, the victory of the military’s favored candidate and party was deemed a foregone conclusion. An election day surprise Election day began with internet and cellular services cut off under the pretext of security, after two terrorist attacks the previous day [killed at least 28 people](https://www.dawn.com/news/1811908) in Balochistan. This was also expected to disrupt turnout, but more than 61 million voters showed up at the polls; voter turnout was 48 percent (relative to 52 percent in the 2018 election). The election result, which took a few days to come in, was a stunning upset: candidates backed by Khan’s PTI won a plurality of parliamentary seats (93 out of 266), though not an outright majority. The party alleges it would have won more seats were it not for interference by the authorities. Party officials cited major discrepancies in polling station versus constituency-level results (the former did not add up to the latter); unexplained delays in vote counting and results being tabulated (results stopped coming in abruptly on election night); and the fact that some candidates “lost” major vote leads reported on election night by the next morning. The Free and Fair Election Network, an election observer, [noted](https://fafen.org/fafen-urges-ecp-to-take-notice-of-non-adherence-to-legal-requirements-by-ros-in-results-tabulation/) that its election agents were not allowed to observe the result tabulations in about half of the electoral constituencies; in dozens of other constituencies, the candidates and their election agents were also prevented from observing the vote tallies (as is their right per Pakistan’s election rules). Nevertheless, the result as it stands is striking, particularly following an election season marked by a state crackdown on the PTI. Moreover, it signifies that the military’s tried-and-tested playbook to influence the country’s politics has failed. Pakistan’s two dynastic parties, Sharif’s PML-N and the Bhutto family’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), came in second and third place, with 75 and 54 legislative seats respectively. The PML-N has traditionally been pro-industry and center-right, while the PPP has veered center-left, but little has differentiated their various stints in power. This was a vote both against the status quo—against the Pakistani military’s political meddling and the dominance of its old guard, the dynastic parties—and one for Khan. Khan has upended Pakistanis’ relationship with their military over the past two years after he pointedly blamed the once-hallowed institution for his dismissal. His base—the country’s youth and middle class—has grown to deeply resent the military’s heavy-handed role in the country’s politics. Pakistan’s youth is a large and growing demographic and an important voting bloc: 44 percent of the electorate this year was [under the age of 35](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/pakistan-elections-2024-by-the-numbers#:~:text=Who%20are%20Pakistan's%20voters%20and,22.3%20percent%20of%20the%20electorate.). To overcome the barriers the PTI faced in campaigning, the party ran a methodical and modern campaign, using artificial intelligence and social media effectively (as well as secret canvassing). By contrast, the PML-N ran a campaign that seemed set in the 1990s in its erstwhile base, Punjab province. On election day, voters showed up at the polls informed on who the PTI-backed independent candidates were—even as each one was assigned a different electoral symbol, ranging from carrots to charpoys. They broke the pattern of voting for “electables”—prominent Pakistani politicians well-versed in patronage politics—instead voting along party lines, regardless of the candidate’s prior political experience. It seemed everyone who had deemed the election’s result a foregone conclusion had underestimated Pakistani voters and the convictions of Khan’s base. The aftermath Despite the election day surprise, Pakistan will get a government that looks very much like the one that came in after Khan’s ouster: the second- and third-largest parties in parliament, the PML-N and PPP, have joined hands once again to form a coalition government. Members of parliament took their oaths of office on February 29; the election of the prime minister is scheduled to be held on March 3. Surprisingly, Nawaz Sharif is out of the fold: His brother Shehbaz, who was prime minister from April 2022 to August 2023 and is more palatable to Pakistan’s military because of his consistent pro-establishment stance, is the coalition’s nominee for prime minister. Nawaz, who has had multiple fallings-out with the military in the past, each leading to his removal as prime minister, seems to have been brought in before the election to appeal to the PML-N’s voter base; he also ensured that his daughter and presumptive heir, Maryam, [took the helm in Punjab](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/ex-pm-nawazs-daughter-is-pakistans-first-female-provincial-chief-minister) as chief minister of the province. Former President Asif Ali Zardari, of the PPP, is the coalition government’s nominee for president. PTI-backed independents have joined with a smaller party in an effort to claim reserved seats; the party did not enter negotiations with the PML-N and PPP. This was no surprise—Khan’s populist politics relies on opposition to these two parties. Without uniting with the PML-N or PPP, the PTI did not have a realistic path to government in a parliamentary system. Meanwhile, the PTI is protesting the election result—on the streets and in the courts. Multiple parties have raised allegations that the elections were rigged—and the media, civil society organizations, and the U.S. and other Western governments have [joined the growing call](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/serious-concerns-world-reacts-to-pakistan-polls-as-vote-count-continues) for investigations of alleged election fraud. However, these claims are likely to get short shrift in Pakistan, where the legal system has worked largely in concert with the establishment this election cycle (as in the past). The election commission, whose faulty performance has been called out across the board, has gone silent. The incoming coalition government will function as a junior partner to the military—Shehbaz’s government handed over unprecedented power to the army in 2023, and it is likely to continue to do so in this term as well. (It is little surprise that Pakistan was [downgraded to an authoritarian regime](https://x.com/TheEIU/status/1762085139180294628?s=20) for 2023 by the Economist Intelligence Unit.) The government faces hard tasks ahead, especially in terms of the economy. It will need to enter a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund as soon as the current one ends in March and will also need to consider debt restructuring soon after, as massive loans totaling about $24 billion come due in the next few months. There is reason to be wary: Neither of the coalition parties has a sound record of economic prudence or growth. The army is now also directly involved in the economy, via the army chief’s membership on a special investment facilitation council. In the end, if the military gets the weak coalition government it wanted—the better to control it—through an election that was neither free nor fair, does the surprise result on election day really matter? It does. Pakistan’s citizens are restive and dissatisfied, their already frayed compact with the establishment broken. The military, which projects itself as the guarantor of stability in Pakistan, has since 2022 generated the worst political crisis the country has seen in decades. Far from returning Pakistan to some modicum of stability, the elections’ conduct has accentuated political tensions in the country. As a result, the incoming coalition government is likely to be unstable. The military failed at decimating the PTI after the most heavy-handed crackdown a party has seen in recent decades, and Pakistanis saw that. They have realized the power of their votes. And they will use it again.",

    "title": "Bolivia llora la muerte del sacerdote español Nicolás Castellanos y honra su legado - Infobae",
    "text": "La Paz, 19 feb (EFE).- La Iglesia católica y autoridades de Bolivia lamentaron la muerte este miércoles del sacerdote español Nicolás Castellanos, quien renunció hace más de tres décadas a la diócesis de Palencia para trabajar por los más pobres en la ciudad oriental de Santa Cruz, un \"legado imborrable\" que también fue recordado en el país suramericano.\nEl Proyecto Hombres Nuevos (PHN), fundado en Bolivia por el sacerdote leonés, confirmó en una publicación en Facebook que Castellanos, obispo emérito de Palencia, murió esta mañana en Santa Cruz.\n\"Nicolás Castellanos Franco dedicó su vida a mejorar las condiciones de vida de los más desfavorecidos, dejando un legado imborrable en nuestra comunidad. Su pasión y compromiso seguirán siendo una fuente de inspiración para todos nosotros\", agregó el mensaje.\nLa Conferencia Episcopal Boliviana (CEB) recordó a Castellanos como \"un gran misionero, conocido por su generosidad y calidez humana\" y elevó oraciones \"por su descanso eterno\".\nLa Gobernación de Santa Cruz expresó su \"profundo pesar\" por la muerte del sacerdote católico, \"un hombre que dedicó su vida al servicio, dejando un legado de solidaridad, justicia y amor por los más necesitados\".\nMientras que la Alcaldía de esa ciudad destacó que fue un pastor que \"entregó su vida al servicio de los niños, jóvenes y familias más necesitadas y que amó la cultura cruceña, convirtiéndose en un embajador de la misma\".\nEn un mensaje en sus redes sociales, el gobernador suspendido de Santa Cruz, Luis Fernando Camacho, también manifestó su \"pesar\" por la muerte de Castellanos, \"un amigo, un guía, un ser humano increíble\".\n\"Hombre de fe, incansable en su labor para con los demás. Sus obras son el legado que permanecerá vivo en los corazones de las miles de personas a las que les cambió la vida. Dios ya lo tiene en su gloria\", añadió Camacho.\n\"Dios lo tenga en su santa gloria. Gracias Monseñor Nicolás Castellanos por acercarnos el evangelio desde su testimonio de vida\", escribió, por su parte, la exvicecanciller y exembajadora de Bolivia en España Carmen Almendras.\nTambién se manifestó el vicepresidente del Tribunal Supremo Electoral (TSE), Francisco Vargas, quien mencionó que el religioso \"dedicó su vida al servicio de la gente más humilde, especialmente en el Plan 3.000\", un barrio populoso de Santa Cruz.\nNacido en un pueblo de León en 1935, en el seno una familia de labradores, Castellanos fue obispo de Palencia durante 13 años, hasta 1991, cuando abandonó esta diócesis para dedicarse a la labor misionera en Bolivia.\nLuego de que el papa Juan Pablo II aceptara su renuncia, el sacerdote se estableció en 1992 en el Plan 3.000, llamado así porque acogió a ese número de familias que habían perdido sus casas por una crecida en 1983 del río Piraí, que bordea Santa Cruz.\nEl Plan tiene ya centenares de miles de habitantes, y, aunque Santa Cruz sea la región más próspera de Bolivia, esa zona en particular es una de las más necesitadas, por lo que Castellanos fundó el Proyecto Hombres Nuevos con los pilares de la educación, la cultura, la salud, la vivienda y la promoción social.\nMás de un centenar de escuelas se construyeron en el país por impulso de Castellanos, cuyo proyecto también desarrolló programas culturales como una escuela de teatro en el Plan 3.000 y una orquesta sinfónica, que en 2017 ofreció un concierto al papa Francisco, entre otros.\nEntre 1991 y 2020, recibió más de medio centenar de distinciones en España y Bolivia, entre ellas el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de la Concordia 1998.\nEn 2021, la Fundación Hombres Nuevos, con sede en Palencia, y el PHN impulsaron su candidatura al premio Nobel de la Paz \"por toda la trayectoria\" del sacerdote por los pobres.\nCastellanos cumplió 90 años el 18 de febrero, un día antes de su fallecimiento.

    "text": "Trae Young applauds Ja Morant for viral after-whistle poster on Victor Wembanyama\nJa Morant's one-handed slam over 7'3\" Victor Wembanyama draws a candid reaction from Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young.\nJa Morant's poster on Wemby has Trae Young in awe\nAfter a tightly contested loss to evenly matched Huston Rockets on Monday, Ja Morant led Memphis Grizzlies flew out to AT&T Center today looking to get even. Grizzlies defeated the Spurs with 115-129 to enter the winning column. Following Thursday’s triumph over Spurs, Grizzlies now sit cozily at 3rd spot with a 26-15 record in the West, where it’s a dogfight for every little inch.\nJa Morant had an efficient night in particular, shooting 9-of-13 from field and 50% from beyond the arc. The high-flying point guard tallied double-double with 21 points and 12 dimes along with 4 boards and 2 takeaways. However, the highlight of the game came late in 4th quarter when Ja unleased his signature behind-the-head one-handed powerful jam over the 7-foot-3 Victor Wembanyama.\nThe clip of the poster has since gone viral with sports-enthusiasts circulating it in every online circuit. Although the dunk was spectacular, it wasn’t added to the score since it occurred after the referees had blown the whistle.\nNonetheless, the difficulty and artistry of the slam were so impressive that it caught the attention of his peer, Trae Young, who shared his candid reaction on Twitter: “Y’all really believed Ja when he said he wasn’t dunking anymore.”\nY’all really believed Ja when he said he wasn’t dunking anymore 😏🤣\n— Trae Young (@TheTraeYoung)[January 16, 2025]\nCalling cap on Ja’s previous comments from earlier this season, Young called out gullible NBA fans for trusting Morant. Memphis’s point guard made striking remarks in early December, saying he was abstaining from dunking to protect his health, doubling down with “Y’all think I’m lying. I’m dead serious.”\nHowever, since then, he has added numerous notable, fancy dunks to his career highlight reel, including a mid-air double-pump throwdown on the defending champs, Boston Celtics.\nJa Morant announced that he is “not trying to dunk at all”\nAfter a road-loss to Dallas Mavericks on 3rd December, Morant spoke to ESPN, talking about why he is quitting dunking. Explaining his decision, Ja said that he was prioritizing his health as an athlete. Dunking involves an inherent risk of injury, especially when the rim attacker is airborne. He further elaborated that the risk-reward ratio is disproportionate, considering how referees can rob players of fair calls.\nJa dunks look even smoother in\n— NBA (@NBA)[#phantomcam]🎥[https://t.co/rYBgPA8zEw][pic.twitter.com/TflyKTo1gM][December 8, 2024]\nSince then, Morant has gone against his own words on numerous occasions. To date, he has made 9 of his 11 dunk attempts as per NBA. Staying true to his gravity-defying, above-the-rim nature, Morant is known for his flight mode and his ability to attack the rim with aggression. Morant’s game is somewhat reminiscent of Derrick Rose’s early explosive style of play.\nHowever, injuries are beginning to slow him down, and he is starting to realize that. In the 2024-25 season alone, Morant has missed 17 of the Grizzlies’ 38 games due to a right shoulder sprain. On Friday, San Antonio will get another shot to redeem themselves against the Grizzlies after today’s disappointing loss. Stay tuned for chapter two of Morant vs. Wemby.",
