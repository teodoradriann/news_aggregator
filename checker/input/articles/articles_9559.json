    "text": "Le Service changement climatique (C3S) de Copernicus, a confirmé, vendredi 10 janvier, que 2024 avait été l'année la plus chaude jamais enregistrée depuis le début des statistiques en 1850. Pour sa part, l'Office météorologique britannique a prévenu que 2025 devrait être l'une des trois plus chaudes enregistrées sur la planète.\nSelon Copernicus, la seule année 2024, mais aussi la moyenne des deux années 2023 et 2024, a dépassé 1,5°C de réchauffement par rapport à l'ère pré-industrielle.

Le réchauffement du climat actuel est inédit depuis au moins 120.000 ans, selon les scientifiques.\nDerrière ces chiffres se cache déjà une série de catastrophes exacerbées par le changement climatique : 1.300 morts en juin lors de chaleurs extrêmes pendant le pèlerinage de La Mecque, des inondations historiques en Afrique de l'Ouest et centrale, [des ouragans violents](https://www.rtl.fr/actu/international/videos-ouragan-milton-les-premieres-images-de-la-tempete-qui-a-frappe-la-floride-7900427145) aux États-Unis et Caraïbes…\nSur le plan économique, les catastrophes naturelles ont causé 320 milliards de dollars de pertes dans le monde en 2024, selon le réassureur Munich Re.

    "title": "He felt 'chased' by anxiety and got help online. Now that resource experts trust could be shut down | CBC News",
    "text": "Joey Laguio remembers waking up every morning in high school with a sense of dread.\n\"It felt like always being chased by something,\" said Laguio, now 33 and living in Vancouver.\nAfter he enrolled in engineering at the University of British Columbia, his first major panic attack hit. Breathing was hard and he trembled, consumed with worries over what others thought of him, he said.\nFrom a counsellor in Vancouver, Laguio learned that he had anxiety, and was referred to Anxiety Canada, a registered charity offering resources online for people with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\"The specific resources were helpful to me because I could access them at any time I wanted to and also because they were a good complement to the therapy I was doing,\" Laguio said.\nNow, however, some mental health experts are worried Anxiety Canada's online resources will cease to be available next April if the organization that had funding cut by the B.C. government earlier this year doesn't find a new source of revenue.\nThey say patients, families and mental health professionals will lose a carefully curated and trustworthy source for mental health information, tips and tools just as misinformation proliferates.\n'Worried about what's going to happen' Dr. Julie Eichstedt, a child psychologist in London, Ont., said although anxiety disorders are very treatable, access to resources is a concern.\n\"I'm worried about what's going to happen to all those people that have been dependent on these [Anxiety Canada] resources,\" Eichstedt said. There's \"really nothing compatible for me to send families to.\"\nLinda Campbell, left, and her son, Ryan Campbell, turned to Anxiety Canada for help several years ago after a suggestion from a child psychiatrist. (Zoom/CBC) Linda Campbell of Nanoose Bay, on Vancouver Island, said she was caught by surprise several years ago when her outwardly happy son told her one day when he was in Grade 3 that it was all too much.\nCampbell initially equated anxiety with stress and overscheduling her son. Then they found a child psychiatrist who suggested Anxiety Canada.\n\"I knew I could trust it,\" Campbell said. \"Every health-care provider said go here because we know what you're going to get, so we have a framework between us to have conversations. I don't think I even realized the importance of it at the time.\"\nAbout one in four people will deal with levels of debilitating anxiety at some point in their lifetime, leaving them unable to work at their full capacity, said Maureen Whittal, a psychologist who co-founded Anxiety Canada in 1999 and is chair of its volunteer board.\nSocially, anxiety can interfere with relationships, including marriage and parenting, she said.\nIncreases in generalized anxiety disorder Statistics Canada says generalized anxiety disorder doubled among those aged 15 and older between 2012 and 2022, rising from 2.6 per cent to 5.2 per cent. Young women 24 and under showed the largest increases.\nAnxiety Canada saw $223,200 in provincial funding removed earlier this year and scaled back its services. It is now a skeleton organization relying on a few volunteers but no paid employees.\nIts MindShift app, which was shut down when the funding was removed, had more than 1.5 million downloads in 2024, with tens of thousands of monthly users, including teens.\nA published study showed use of the app reduced anxiety and stigma and Whittal hopes it could resume if further founding is found. Some of Anxiety Canada's online resources continue to be available as it winds down its services.\nCampbell, who is a member of a support group for parents whose children have anxiety disorders, said people will grasp onto what they think will offer quick and easy solutions.\n\"They're kind of in a desperate moment and they think that this will solve their problem,\" she said. \"I think that's why it's really important to say: 'Here's what we know is proven techniques.'\"\nLaguio says he started his mental health journey with professionals 12 years ago. (Matthew Fong) Earlier this year, Anxiety Canada also wound down its educational podcasts and TikTok videos modelling best practices and cut an online cognitive behaviour treatment program as its funding was reduced.\nEichstedt said she recommends Anxiety Canada to parents and teachers because all the evidence-based content and practical examples are in one place, setting it apart from other services.\nGuide to effective treatments For children, avoidance behaviours are one of the hallmarks of anxiety, Eichstedt said. They may miss school, not participate in class or make friends. Marks can go down because the student is afraid to ask for help or can't complete their homework.\n\"There may be lots of tears, there could be tantrums,\" Eichstedt said.\nBut left untreated, anxiety tends to persist and can fuel other problems like depression. Treating anxiety is important to make sure kids develop as they're supposed to, she said.\nWATCH | Overcoming the stigma around mental health struggles: People often wear a mask to hide mental health struggles. Here are tips to help remove it\n3 months ago For this year's Mental Health Week, the theme is Unmasking Mental Health. CBC Montreal host Douglas Gelevan speaks with Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief of the department of psychology at the MUHC, about ways people can help themselves or their loved ones overcome the stigma. Robert Roopa, a psychologist and psychotherapist in York Region, north of Toronto, said he often refers to Anxiety Canada's articles and videos.\n\"If the site is no longer available, I'm concerned that an increasing number of people who need OCD and anxiety support will not receive the appropriate treatment,\" Roopa said. Then the patient loses time and money on what doesn't help their specific problems.\nFilling a 'critical gap' Dr. Peggy Richter, a psychiatrist in Toronto who heads the Frederick W. Thompson Anxiety Disorder Centre at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, says that ideally, people would see a live therapist for help.\n\"But we recognize across Canada with our geography that that [isn't] always feasible and people with expertise in how to treat the anxiety disorder psychologically are very often very hard to find covered by OHIP or provincial health-care systems,\" said Richter, who also specializes in OCD.\n\"MindShift was filling a really critical gap.\"\nThe B.C. government's Mental Health and Substance Use Services (BCMHSUS), which provides specialized services in the province, said it issued a contract this year worth about $1 million to BC Partners. Anxiety Canada had been of member of the partners, a group of mental health and substance use organizations, but was no longer included by the government this year.\nThe 2025/26 funding is half of the $2 million given the previous year, BCMHSUS said.\n\"While this is less than last year's contract, it is a substantial contribution to health literacy. The other funds were directed towards critical front-line services supporting the care and recovery of people with mental health disorders.\"\nMaureen Whittal says Anxiety Canada's mission is to provide evidence-based psychological resources to help people and their families. (Zoom/CBC) B.C.'s Health Ministry said its relationship with Anxiety Canada through BCMHSUS ended earlier this year. No further provincial funding will be available for Anxiety Canada for the next fiscal year, beginning in April.\nTo revert to full service would take $1 million annually, Whittal said.\nEichstedt is organizing a letter-writing campaign to try to save the now volunteer-run group. She'd like to see federal funding for Anxiety Canada as a national resource and program for anxiety and related disorders.\nLaguio, the Vancouver resident, said Anxiety Canada complemented the cognitive behaviour therapy sessions his parents paid for with a psychologist.\nAs a teen and young adult, Laguio said he dreaded even the thought of driving. \"I would have existential crises of like: 'What if I what if I hurt someone or like someone's life ends because of me?'\"\nLISTEN | Trying to get people to talk about OCD :\nOntario Today What do you wish people knew about obsessive compulsive disorder? Justine De Jaegher was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder in her twenties. It was a disorder that she tried to hide from friends and family. Now she's trying to get people to talk about OCD -- to increase public understanding of the disorder. Justine is joined by clinical psychologist Dr. Caitlin Claggett Woods. Some days he'd stick with what he called a \"two\" on a 10-point fear scale of Anxiety Canada's fear ladder exercise, where you list actions you'd typically steer clear of and then slowly work through them. For him, it started with driving around a quiet block at night.\nNow, Laguio calls the cognitive behaviour therapy received through Anxiety Canada \"foundational\" to managing his relationships and work.\nLaguio said as a non-profit, he felt Anxiety Canada had his best interests at heart.\n\"It was free,\" he said. \"As someone who was really struggling with my career and finances, that's kind of what I needed.\"",

    "title": "Q & A with Stacey Lee",
    "text": "Following the conclusion of her middle grade fantasy duology, the Winston Chu books, Stacey Lee returns to her historical YA roots with murder mystery novel Kill Her Twice, which takes place in 1932 Chinatown Los Angeles. When sisters May, Gemma, and Peony Chow discover the body of movie star Lulu Wong, a hometown celebrity, the siblings worry that justice will not be served and endeavor to honor Lulu’s legacy—and prevent the killer from striking again—by solving her murder. As the trio investigate, they’re met with resistance from the police, who underplay Lulu’s death, and political forces that want to paint Chinatown as a place full of “drunken and slovenly” people. In a conversation with PW, Lee discussed writing her first murder mystery, her foray into middle grade, and how her research informs her novels.\nIn your\n2019 Q & A with PW, you said you “do a lot of research in order to find the story. For me, I always seem to look for the place first.” Was that also true of Kill Her Twice?\nYes, it definitely was. I had always wanted to set a book in Los Angeles, which is where I grew up, and which is actually where I am currently—my parents still live in the same house I was born in. I come back pretty often. And of course, Chinese people have been here for a long time. There were so many fun elements to work with—especially with old Hollywood, which is right near Chinatown, at least during that time period—that I thought I could use to create Kill Her Twice, which is the first murder mystery that I’ve written.\nWhy did you choose to set Kill Her Twice in 1930s Hollywood?\nIt just felt like it was a natural fit. Have you ever seen Chinatown with Jack Nicholson? I had purposefully never seen it, because I knew that a movie set back then wasn’t going to be very flattering to the Chinese. I have a hard time with a lot of the Chinese stereotypes that are in those kinds of movies, and watching them can be triggering for me.\nWhen I finally did sit down to watch it, I thought it was a necessary thing to do before I wrote a book that took place in the same time period. In the movie, Chinatown represents the “other.” Who knows what goes on in Chinatown? The movie takes place from Jack Nicholson’s perspective, so Chinatown was like a completely foreign country to him, if you will. So, I thought to myself, “I want to change that narrative. I don’t want people to think of Chinatown as this evil, mysterious place where bad stuff happens.” I wanted to show people that there were young girls there, and they were doing some remarkable things. I wanted to say, “This is a place you and I could visit and we would not be in danger.” [Chinese American film star] Anna May Wong grew up in 1930s Chinatown, and back then, it wasn’t the scary place that it was made out to be.\nSpeaking of Anna May Wong, in your author's note, you quote her as saying, “When I die, my epitaph should be: ‘She died a thousand deaths.’ ” Did that play a role in inspiring the murder mystery premise?\nIt absolutely did. She was so villainized; so many of her roles were as the villain. She eventually got fed up with that and I think she moved to Europe and pursued film there, where she had a little more freedom in her roles. I wanted the victim in this story to be based on her, which is how I created Lulu Wong. It’s sort of like art imitating life, if you will, because it’s her death that’s the catalyst for the protagonists to get involved with finding out who the murderer is. What better way to show how this sort of perception can result in something so horrible?\nSome protagonists from your previous novels are also based on historical figures. What does your process for creating characters based on real people look like?\nI read a lot about Anna May Wong’s life, which really helped color in my descriptions of Chinatown. I didn’t know much about her until I started doing research for this book, which was around the time the quarter with her face on it came out, so she was already in the zeitgeist.\nBut I’m always careful not to use the person’s name or suggest that this was actually Anna May Wong’s life, especially because I want to have the freedom to play with that in the story. I just like having those kinds of details to give readers something interesting to spark their curiosity and compel them to learn more about these people and to find out the real story on their own.\nActually, a book came out a few months ago about the life of Anna May Wong by Katie Gee Salisbury called Not Your China Doll. So, there are all sorts of wonderful actual true accounts of her life.\nHow challenging is it to puzzle together the appropriate historical elements to communicate the story you want to tell?\nOften what happens is, when I start doing research, learning about the different elements associated with a particular place or time period adds to the plot—it helps me develop the plot. I didn’t know so many of the things that had happened in Los Angeles Chinatown until I started doing the research, and that led to some of the plot lines. A good example: the more I learned about the history of Union Station and how it affected Chinatown, the more it became part of the story.\nI also learned about the Los Angeles Chinese massacre of 1871. Articles I read say up to 19 people were killed. And this had a profound effect on the Chinese and on Chinatown. I feel like learning that shaped how my characters thought and felt about the different places they went to, because an event like that is going to be burned into the collective memory. So, while some of my research might not make its way into a plot point, it’s always affecting the story.\nWhile most of your backlist is YA, you’ve also published two middle grade novels. How has your experience writing them compared to developing your YA novels?\nI’d say that the process is about the same in terms of finding the character and plotting out the story. And there is definitely a lot of research involved. The Winston Chu series was set in San Francisco, and even though I live very close to San Francisco, it’s still important to me to really understand the city.\nI thought I was going to write shorter books for middle grade, but I ended up writing the same length. I think that’s just how my brain works: “This is the middle, this needs to be right here, it needs to have this many chapters before this inciting event.”\nI think there was a lot more freedom in terms of language and humor, which is always fun. There have been a lot of times where I wrote humor into my historical fiction, and it didn’t pass muster with my beta readers or my editor because it just felt too young. I also think my natural humor is probably more like middle grade potty humor.\nAs someone who’s mostly written realistic contemporary and historical novels, what compelled you to write a middle grade fantasy?\nPart of that was informed by the Riordan imprint, since all the books are based around cultural mores. And I really enjoyed doing more research into the cultural folklore that I didn’t grow up with as an Asian American. I have my kids enrolled in Chinese lessons because I don’t speak any Mandarin or Cantonese. They would tell me about the cultural folktales they learned and I loved them so much. I even realized that they were very similar to a lot of the more Western folktales that I had grown up with. All around the world, we’re hearing the same stories with the same lessons and emotional arcs, they just look a little different. So, writing Winston Chu was my chance to learn more about these mythologies.\nWriting with a little bit of fantasy, and being able to create and not have to worry if I was being historically accurate was so much fun. I created a character that was a mustache. It’s called Mischief Mustache. I thought, “How fun is it to be able to create a character that’s just a living mustache?”\nKill Her Twice by Stacey Lee.

    "title": "'Wrong as usual': Don Trump Jr. quietly deletes conspiracy theory after brutal fact check",
    "text": "Former President Donald Trump's eldest son quietly deleted his debunked conspiracy theory about the upcoming debate Thursday after he was subjected to a brutal fact check. While House Republican Nancy Mace cried foul play over undisclosed \"vitamins ,\" Trump Jr. decided to claim CNN would rig the debate by implementing a two-minute air-time delay. \"Live TV has a seven second delay,\" Trump Jr. wrote in the since-deleted tweet. \"Why on earth would CNN need a 1-2 MINUTE delay unless they were planning on manipulating tonight’s debate?\" CNN has publicly denied the claim — stating simply \" this is false \" — and notes the debate will begin airing promptly at 9 p.m. ET. ALSO READ: ‘Creepy weirdos’: Senator fears Trump WH staff would destroy government from ‘inside’ Hedging his bets, the former president's son also decided to accuse Biden — baselessly — of doping. \"If he wasn’t jacked up on all sorts of drugs, why wouldn’t he submit to such an easy test?\" said Trump Jr. Fellow X users had some answers for him. \"No delay, Junior,\" replied former MSNBC host Keith Olbemann . \"Wrong as usual/Lying as usual/Daddy still doesn't know you exist, as usual.\" \"The whining and crying continues,\" commented X user Chidi . \"Meanwhile back on earth, CNN is NOT putting the live feed on a 1-2-minute delay.\" \"Stop making excuses even before the debate,\" replied X user The New York Independent . \"Never seen such pearl clutching paranoia.\" Trump Jr. deleted the tweet, time-stamped at 3:53 p.m., less than an hour after it went live, but not before it had been viewed more than 500,000 times. An updated message does not include the lag time claim and includes instead a new reference to performance enhancers. \"The New York Post published an article about all the drugs that he could 'legally' take to give him an appearance of clarity,\" he wrote instead. \"He'll be higher than Hunter!\" Replied X user Art Candee , \"You’re not one to talk, Cokey.\" A tweet written and deleted by Donald Trump Jr. on June 27, 2024.",

    "text": "The Joke\nIsraelis butchered by Hamas on October 7, 2023\nIt is good, in the face of slaughter,\nto keep a sense of humour.\nThere’s nothing like a joke\nto lighten the heart and help one cope\nwith the heebie-jeebies of the day.\nAnd without doubt they could do\nwith a little lightness and laughter,\nthe surviving Jewess and Jew\nwhose ears on the seventh day of October\nrang with the Prophet’s war whoop.\n“Allahu Akbar”, explained one scholar,\nmeans merely “God is greater”\n(being Islam’s God, of course)\nand essentially denotes “a celebration\nof life, not death and destruction”.\nLaugh, what? It’s side-splitting!\nA jaunty jest brassier than a jihadi.\nAnd a US Senator got in on the gig,\nclaiming, “the phrase is no more troubling\nthan a Christian saying ‘Thank God’”.\nThank God for a gag and a giggle, eh?\nStill, they are mostly a gloomy lot,\nthe Jews, any excuse to moan and mope,\ndespite the proverb of King Solomon,\n“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.”\nAllahu Akbar! A cry of celebration?\nIt’s a joke, a quack’s prescription.\nSo yuck it up, Jews, guffaw loud and gruff.\nMuhammad’s men are gathering again\nto help you laugh your heads off.\nAndrew Lansdown\nA Lament for Israel\nOctober 7, 2023\nWhat wondrous hate is this,\noh my soul, oh my soul?\nTo chop the founts of bliss\nfrom a mother’s chest …\nTo boost an oven’s heat\nto bake a baby whole …\nWhat wondrous hate is this,\noh my soul, oh my soul?\nAndrew Lansdown\nRinged In\nAt the airport I am reminded of a stallion\nI once saw beside the Blackwood River.\nThere is a young man ahead of me,\na little restless, yes, but mostly docile,\nmaking his way with stops and starts\ntowards the uniforms and x-ray machines.\nHe is following a maze path defined by\nnylon straps stretched between chrome stanchions.\nNotwithstanding the power and champing\nof his youth, he does not think to make\na break for it—to push against the straps\nuntil the moveable posts topple, then step\nover the jumble, lifting his feet high\nas a wild horse might lift its hooves\nto avoid entanglement going forward.\nAnd watching him I recall that stallion\nI saw a decade before we all were gelded\nby fear of the jihadis and their holy war—\na chestnut charger untethered and unyarded\nbut nonetheless unfree under four gumtrees\nwhose trunks were the corner posts\nfor a single strand of flimsy plastic ribbon—\nwhite ribbon that baulked the great beast\nand ringed it in as sure as wood or iron railing.\nAndrew Lansdown",

    "text": "Nuovo appuntamento, dopo l’iniziativa andata in scena al Parco della Colonia Ugo Pisa a fine giugno, con le passeggiate ecologiche di Plastic Free Onlus. Questa volta il ritrovo, previsto per domenica alle 18, sarà in piazza Bad Kissingen e ci sarà anche un ospite molto speciale. Si tratta di Leone Ortega, 27enne pratese, che sta compiendo il giro d’Italia in canoa nell’ambito del progetto “Wind of change”.\nObiettivo sensibilizzare sull’inquinamento da plastica. Partito il primo maggio da Venezia, l’atleta toscano ha circumnavigato l’Italia con la sua canoa, attraversando lo Stretto di Messina, per portare l’attenzione sulle conseguenze devastanti che l’inquinamento marino ha sulla salute e la vita. Un viaggio in solitaria per raccontare cosa sta accadendo nei nostri mari ma anche per raccogliere dati raccolti insieme al team di “Wind of change“. L’avventura sportiva di Leone Ortega è una missione ambientale a cui l’atleta si sta dedicando da mesi.\nDomenica sarà presente all’evento di raccolta organizzato dai volontari Plastic Free a Marina di Massa, sotto la guida del referente locale Daniele D’Alessandro: \"Accoglieremo Ortega, che essendo toscano ha particolare piacere a fermarsi sulle nostre coste, poi prenderà il via questo nuovo evento di raccolta, una passeggiata ecologica – spiega – Le iscrizioni si possono fare nella sezione eventi del sito www.plasticfreeonlus.it\". L’obiettivo di Ortega è arrivare a Genova.\nIl progetto “Wind of Change” vuole riuscire a promuovere la salvaguardia dell’ambiente marino attraverso azioni concrete con il supporto di Plastic Free Onlus, associazione di volontariato impegnata dal 2019 nel contrastare l’inquinamento da plastica. Lungo il percorso, infatti, Leone Ortega ha trovato rifiuti di ogni tipo: dalle reti a uso alimentare alle bottiglie, dai packaging al polistirolo, dai pellet di microplastiche ai mozziconi di sigarette. Il viaggio in canoa di Leone proseguirà nei prossimi giorni lungo le coste della Regione Toscana. In tutto il percorso affrontato, Ortega è accompagnato da Giacomo Arrighini che lo segue con il suo minivan, garantendo sicurezza e supporto logistico lungo il tragitto.",

    "text": "Gardening is a joyful as well as a crucial activity in which many people must indulge themselves. It not only needs to be done to pass the time but to fulfill the necessity of greenery in our environment, which is extremely important due to increasing global warming issues. However, most people prefer home gardening, which they can do in their backyards or rooftops. But, have you ever considered indulging yourself in a community garden? Well, if you haven’t, it’s time to try joining a community garden now, and if you are stuck at the “why” phase, below are some top-notch reasons that will make you fond of community gardens.\nJoined a community garden!\nby u/PumpkinHat15 in Homesteading 1. A way to make a lively and healthy environment First things first, growing plants at home in a small space is a good choice as it also contributes to making our environment green, but gardens that are made for different people to join in are often large. So, the greenery level is high there and this is how you can access different varieties of plants and trees, and growing them in bulk is not possible at home due to the lesser space. Also, when more plants and trees cover a larger space, it promotes a healthy environment and makes it livelier for people.\n“Drops of Hope: Unveiling a new chapter of vitality in water-scarce lands, our 17ft deep communal well stands as a testament to unity and perseverance. Serving 360 homes and empowering vegetable community gardens, one well at a time for humans, animals and the environment. pic.twitter.com/gtqcTRDVqw\n— Charity Doings Foundation (@CharityDoings) May 16, 2024 2. Get to have fresh food When discussing gardening, fresh food consumption cannot be left out. Even though community gardens often involve flowering and veggie gardening, most people prefer them to grow and get fresh food for themselves as it is often chemical-free and healthier. Also, community gardening allows people to grow the separate foods they like, so they can bring them home after harvesting. It also helps many people consume meat-free diets as they are super delicious as well.\nThe lads have turned a total waste land of a space into a beautiful garden.\nI can testify that it's a joy to sit in, it's more than the sum of all the plants.\nIt's hope, it's community, it's peace.\nTo plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. https://t.co/tzmWmpZNP8\n— Dr Sharon Lambert (@sharonlambert0) August 12, 2024 3. Help you establish strong social connections One of the most prominent reasons to join community gardens is to build better and stronger social connections. Firstly, gardening is for all ages, from kids to adults to old, community gardens are a perfect escape for all people that not only works as a great time pass but also allow everyone to meet new people and make friends and some of the connections may last for lifetime. So, it’s a good approach for socializing as well.\nComment\nby u/ExpiredColors from discussion\nin NianticWayfarer 4. Support economic opportunities Even though community gardens do not offer jobs, they can be volunteered, they may not provide you with a salary but they can help you save lots of money that is often spent in buying packaged and stored food from stores and they are expensive as well. Community gardens allow people to grow their food from scratch that can be brought home fresh every day, saving you from store-bought food and promoting health. In short, you can save lots of grocery bills.\nWe are one of the 36 gardens that make Philadelphia #AmericasGardenCapital . Together, our gardens generate nearly $4 million for the region as we attract 2.5 million visitors a year.\nLearn more how public gardens contribute to economic development: https://t.co/sbORsG1CFw pic.twitter.com/o19OVvOxD6\n— Longwood Gardens (@longwoodgardens) August 18, 2018 5. Promote well-being and healthier lifestyles Indulging yourself in the community garden is a way to exercise regularly without joining gyms. Next, access to fresh food is beneficial for health as it is often more nutritious and flavorful as well than store-bought food. Moreover, meeting new people and immersing yourself in a lively activity while surrounded by nature improves mood and can work as a great stress reliever. All these aspects of community gardening promote well-being and healthier lifestyles for people.\nCommunity gardens bring fresh food closer to Roanoke\nby u/susiecambria in Virginia",

    "text": "A multi-week journey of kotahitanga (unity or solidarity) and rangatiratanga (self-determination) came to a heartfelt conclusion on Wednesday as the crew of Hawke’s Bay-based waka hourua Te Matau a Māui made their welcome return after attending the 2024 Te Hau Kōmaru festival in Kaiteriteri near Nelson. Children as young as 13 sailed the weeks-long trip, which featured everything from bioluminescent dolphins to nearly missing the start of the festival. Mitchell Hageman spoke to the vessel navigators about the trip’s core focus: Encouraging the next generation to harness the celestial navigation skills and mātauranga (traditional knowledge) of those who came before. The joy on the faces of the rangatahi (young) crew could be seen from miles off Napier’s Perfume Point on Wednesday as they experienced the thrill of traditional ocean navigation. Coupled with a roaring haka from the shore, it was undoubtedly an emotional return to Ahuriri Napier for those on board the Te Matau a Māui waka hourua, the double-hulled voyaging canoe, with many young people having completed their first voyage. “It was great. It took us about four days to get down, and we had reasonably good weather,” skipper Te Kaha (TK) Hawaikirangi said. “We spent a little longer around Castlepoint before we timed our run across Cook Strait to catch the currents of the winds.” He said there was a small risk the group might not have made it to the festival on time, but a well-timed run quashed any concerns. “We did get to the festival on time, which was in doubt a little bit in the days out, but we timed our run really well and got there the night before the pōwhiri.” They weren’t alone on their voyage either. “We saw dolphins every day. The highlight was that they stayed with us through the night. When you’ve got bioluminescent algae in the water, it lights it up blue,” he said. “Even in pitch black, you could see the outline of the dolphins and the spray that comes off as they swim.” Seven rangatahi made their first voyage over the two legs, and Hawaikirangi credited them and the rest of the crew for their huge effort. “They all performed really well in some challenging situations. They worked two shifts a day, some of which were at night. I’m really proud of the team.” Navigator Piripi Smith said the return voyage was a great opportunity for some of the new crew to get coastal sailing experience. Many undertook the journey with their parents. “The highlight for me was to see our young crew members being able to handle the moana. “We had seven rangatahi do their first sails over the two legs; our three youngest were 13-year-old Millie Logan, 14-year-old Tainga Smith and 15-year-old Tamas Madarasz-Smith, all children of current crew members.” Rangatahi had to undergo the same training as the rest of the crew and prove themselves to be selected. “All our tamariki helped to deliver education programmes about the waka, the stars, and the seasons to the public and other schools when we were in Kaiteriteri,” Smith said. “Our main aim is to pass this traditional knowledge on to our tamariki like it has been passed down through the generations for thousands of years; we are just following in the wake of our ancestors.” Built in 2009, the waka utilises traditional designs and is owned by Ngāti Kahungunu iwi and managed by the Ātea a Rangi Educational Trust. “In my opinion, this is one of the best investments by the iwi, a taonga that transcends generations and passes on mātauranga,” Smith said. The trust is already planning its next big venture, with a key focus on island exploration around Tahiti. “We are now starting to raise funds for our next voyage to the islands in two to three years,” Smith said. “The purpose of the voyage is to follow the kōrero of our ancestral waka Takitimu and visit the various islands that have received different names.” Mitchell Hageman joined Hawke’s Bay Today in January 2023.
