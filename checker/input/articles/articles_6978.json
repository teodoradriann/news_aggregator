    "text": "TSA unveils new identity verification tech at ANC security checkpoints ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - New identity verification technology is being rolled out at Anchorage‘s Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) says facial matching technology will be used to verify a traveler’s identity during the process of security screening, prior to boarding a plane. The next time a traveler arrives at the airport for security screening, they can expect to see a Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) machine, which is equipped to take a real-time image of the traveler. The new machines are similar to the first generation CAT machines, but have cameras that compare the photo on a traveler’s identification with their real-time photo. “We know that we can enhance the job that TSA officers have been doing since the inception of the agency, but by using this technology, it gives them an extra tool to make sure that the traveler standing in front of them is the one that is featured on the photo ID, which is the one that has been vetted to ensure that they don’t pose a security risk,” explained TSA spokesperson Lorie Dankers. Dankers said that the photo is completely optional. Travelers are permitted to opt out in favor of an alternative identify verification process that is lengthier. “[A traveler’s] photo is only used for immediate identity verification,” she added. “It’s never used for any other purpose. It’s that real-time photo compared against the photo on — whatever you’re presenting as your photo ID.” She says that the technology is expected to improve safety while also speeding up the security process, as travelers won’t need to present a boarding pass along with identification. “Your biographical information, as well as your flight information, will appear on screen,” Dankers said. “And that’s all done with technology. “All the traveler has to do is hand over that photo ID. So it’s very simple, very streamlined, and so it does keep the line moving.” According to Dankers, the CAT machine cameras are accurate to roughly 99.7%. She said that the camera is able to take into account changes in a person, like weight gain or loss, facial hair or lack thereof. “The camera captures a wide shot of the traveler, and then it crops it down to its face, and that ensures that the traveler doesn’t have to position in just the right place in front of the camera,” she explained. “It’s really a very flexible technology.” The new CAT machines are coming to airports nationwide. Each TSA officer is receiving six hours of classroom training and two hours of on-the-job training to get familiar with the new technology. “We’re so happy that [the new technology has] come to Alaska,” Dankers said. “You’re going to see it soon in Juneau, as well as here at Anchorage, so keep an eye for it.” Copyright 2024 KTUU.

    "title": "Legal Strategies for Environmentally Conscious Companies",
    "text": "As concerns over climate change and ecological devastation intensify, environmental consciousness has shifted from a minor consideration to a core strategic element of business. Companies are realizing that aligning their operations with sustainable practices isn’t just an ethical imperative — it’s becoming vital for long-term business stability.\nLegal strategies serve as a crucial compass to confidently navigate the complex interplay of regulations, sustainability objectives, and emerging climate-resilient technologies. Stay tuned below as we explore these key legal approaches forward-thinking companies can employ to drive sustainability while ensuring regulatory compliance.\nEnvironmental Sustainability: Legal Obligations\nUnderstanding legal obligation and corporate responsibility is critical when striving for sustainability. Every business is subject to diverse regulations encompassing foundational areas like water and energy use, even if the specifics change. Let’s explore the key areas that environmentally conscious businesses need to focus on to ensure legal compliance and drive positive change – these include regulations, compliance requirements, and a word on the risks of non-compliance.\nEnvironmental Regulations & Compliance\nEnvironmental regulations vary by country, state, and even local jurisdictions, covering areas like air and water quality, waste management, and energy efficiency. Companies need to monitor and report emissions, manage hazardous materials, and meet specific energy performance standards. Compliance involves integrating these requirements into daily operations, conducting regular environmental audits, training staff, and upgrading equipment as needed.\nBenefits of Sustainability for Businesses\nThere are many proven benefits of sustainability beyond legal compliance. It can lead to significant cost savings via waste reduction and increased efficiency, stronger brand reputation, higher stakeholder engagement, and even transforms employee behavior . Companies that prioritize sustainability tend to be more innovative and better prepared for future regulatory changes or market shifts.\nRisks of Environmental Non-Compliance\nFailing to meet environmental regulations can have severe consequences — hefty fines, costly litigation, reputation damage, and criminal charges for executives in the most flagrant cases. Other than legal penalties, non-compliant businesses may lose out on contracts, erode customer trust, and diminish investor confidence. Last but not least, companies already behind in compliance face a steeper climb in the face of increasingly strict requirements.\nCrafting Effective Sustainability Goals\nPlotting effective sustainability goals is essential for making a meaningful environmental impact. These goals provide direction and accountability, helping businesses translate their environmental values into concrete actions. By taking advantage of the SMART goal framework, aligning goals with legal obligations, and integrating sustainability into every facet of a business, leaders can get a headstart on compliance while staying up-to-date with new requirements.\nSetting SMART Objectives\nThe aforementioned goals should follow the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Instead of a vague goal like “reduce waste,” a SMART objective might be “decrease landfill waste by 30% within two years through improved recycling programs.” This approach allows companies to track progress, adjust strategies as needed, and celebrate milestones along the way.\nAligning Goals with Legal Obligations\nWhile ambitious sustainability goals are admirable, companies must align goals with not just current but future regulations in mind. Alignment ensures that a company’s environmental efforts contribute to compliance while pushing beyond minimum standards and helping future-proof operations. If regulations require a 10% reduction in carbon emissions, a forward-thinking company might set a goal of a 20% reduction.\nCorporate Sustainability Integration\nImage by Perry Grone, via Unsplash.com. For sustainability goals to drive real change, they need to be woven into the fabric of your corporate decision-making process. This might involve creating a sustainability committee on the board of directors, tying executive compensation plans to aligned goals, or establishing regular sustainability reporting to stakeholders.\nImplementing Sustainable Practices\nCompanies at the forefront of environmental consciousness are leveraging cutting-edge technologies and practices to turn sustainability into reality. From adopting climate-resilient innovations to adopting digital tools for more accurate sustainability tracking, companies are taking a new tack toward more realistic sustainable practices — explore these in more detail below.\nAdopting Climate-Resilient Innovations\nAs climate change accelerates at an unprecedented and volatile pace, businesses should consider embracing climate-resilient construction to cut costs and future-proof operations. Energy-efficient building materials, such as advanced insulation or smart glass, can significantly reduce heating and cooling needs. Green infrastructure — like living roofs or permeable pavements — helps manage stormwater runoff and reduces urban heat island effects in susceptible areas.\nDigital Tools for Sustainability Tracking\nDigital technologies have revolutionized how businesses track and enhance corporate sustainability . IoT sensors can provide real-time water, energy, and waste data to sustainability tracking software that integrates with other business metrics — these allow businesses greater flexibility in tackling minor and major regulatory shifts while streamlining operations.\nWrapping Up\nThe path to environmental consciousness for businesses is both a legal necessity and a strategic opportunity. Businesses should first endeavor to understand their pertinent legal landscape as far as regulations, use that information to set achievable goals and integrate sustainable practices into day-to-day operations.",

    "text": "Di tutte le rappresentazioni pittoriche della Pasqua, forse il Noli me tangere è una delle più suggestive e affascinanti. La locuzione latina, tradotta dal greco, si trova nel Vangelo di Giovanni e contiene infinite sfumature di senso. Da «non toccarmi» a «non trattenermi», quindi «lasciami andare». La raffigurazione del Beato Angelico (1440 circa) nel convento fiorentino di San Marco è una delle più famose e riassume bene l’episodio evangelico: la domenica successiva alla Crocifissione, mentre Pietro e Giovanni vanno al vedere la tomba vuota di Gesù, Maria Maddalena resta nel giardino. I discepoli vanno a verificare , la donna si ferma ad ascoltare . Più che dalla tomba scoperchiata — elemento concreto, tangibile — lei è attratta da qualcosa che non si può né vedere né toccare con mano, come invece chiede Tommaso. La donna comprende che la verità non risiede nella misurazione dell’esattezza dei dettagli, quanto nell’intimo sentire ed è proprio questo atto di fede che la porta a vedere il Cristo risorto in quella figura con la zappa in mano, del tutto simile al custode del luogo.
