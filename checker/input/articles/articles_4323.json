    "text": "At Bernhard Mairinger’s new [Austrian-inflected restaurant](https://la.eater.com/2022/4/20/23034312/bernhard-mairinger-lustig-culver-city-restaurant-opening-2023) [Lustig](https://lustig-la.com/), the 6-foot 8-inch-tall chef will feed anyone taller than him for free. This signature offering, which [dates back to his Beverly Hills restaurant BierBeisl](https://la.eater.com/2015/8/27/9217103/if-youre-taller-than-this-super-tall-austrian-chef-you-eat-for-free), includes an appetizer, entree, and drink. Though only a small number of the population will actually qualify for the special, the rest of the dining crowd can still get a taste Mairinger’s famed wiener schnitzel and chicken liver profiteroles at his newest Los Angeles restaurant. At Lustig, which opened on December 30, 2023 at the Helms Bakery complex inside the former La Dijonnaise space, Mairinger offers a more relaxed version of what he was serving at BierBeisl. The fine dining spot drew [ local](https://la.eater.com/2012/4/23/6593637/siv-reviews-bierbeisl-gold-on-wang-xing-ji) and national acclaim, including a [ best new restaurant](https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/restaurants/a16140/best-new-restaurants-2012-full-list/) nod from Esquire in 2012, for its elegant takes on classic Austrian dishes. Before that, Mairinger made his mark as the chef de cuisine of fine dining stalwart Patina when it [earned](https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-0610-review-20100610-story.html) a [four-star review](https://la.eater.com/2010/6/10/6730359/four-full-stars-for-patina-curious-creations-at-the-slaw-dogs) from the Los Angeles Times. Since the closure of Bierbeisl Imbiss, Mairinger’s [ short-lived](https://la.eater.com/2013/10/29/6344059/bierbeisl-moving-out-of-bh-in-november-headed-west) European-style cafe and bakery that [ opened](https://la.eater.com/2015/6/29/8862217/bierbeisl-imbiss-downtown-los-angeles-restaurant-gallery-photos#0) in Downtown LA in 2015, he’s been busy with his [ catering company and private cheffing](https://chefbernhard.com/party-event-catering) across the city. Now Mairinger is back and ready to charm Angelenos with his elegant European cooking fused with hints of LA flair. The opening dinner menu includes a range of smaller dishes like chocolate-topped chicken liver profiteroles with verjus gelée; roasted beet salad with vanilla goat cheese and endive slices; and a trout caviar-topped Caesar salad with Parmesan crisps. BierBeisl fans will be pleased to see the return of the house salad with crispy pork belly, as well as the roasted butternut squash soup with Gruyere crostini. The halfway point of the menu features spelt sourdough flatbreads meant to be shared with the table. Versions include a peperonata and zucchini-topped “ratatouille” and a Swiss raclette with potato confit slivers, grilled radicchio, and pickled vegetables. The hearty crusted Austrian pizzas work well as a stomach filler before the main courses like a braised beef cheek sauerbraten served over rosemary spatzle and baby carrots, and Jidori chicken paired with thin aglio e olio-dressed asparagus and stewed cranberry beans in a pool of lemon-tarragon jus. The chef’s prized veal wiener schnitzel is pounded thin and served with lingonberry-yuzu jam, peewee potatoes, and sliced shishito pepper for an extra kick. Also on hand is a rolling cheese cart. Mairinger developed a passion for cheese early in his career when he was tasked with managing immense cheese programs at Zürserhof in Austria and later at Patina. He’ll be serving dozens of options over time at Lustig. Currently, a spreadable spiced Liptauer is served with assorted house-made sourdough breads, softened butter, and potato cheese. For dessert, pastry chef Giselle Habib prepares apple strudel cigars with an apple sorbet; vegan coconut panna cotta with white chocolate and tropical fruits; and a gingerbread mille feuille with poached bear and Bavarian cream. To drink are terrific cocktails from veteran bartender Erik Lund (Alexander’s Steakhouse, Republique) and a mostly Austrian wine list. TikTok-famous [ water sommelier](https://www.eater.com/2013/8/6/6390275/la-restaurant-has-45-page-water-menu-water-sommelier) [ Martin Riese](https://www.eater.com/23063890/best-bottled-water-how-to-shop-packaging-source) will develop a bottled water pairing and menu for Lustig as soon as his tenure at Gwen ends in a few weeks. The “market price” side of ketchup on the menu gently pokes fun at adjacent restaurant Father’s Office, a place that famously doesn’t serve ketchup with its burger or fries thanks to chef Sang Yoon’s longtime hatred of the condiment. Mairinger says he’ll probably charge around $2 for anyone brave enough to carry a small dish over to the gastropub, but doubts anyone will do it. The interior design comes from Studio UNLTD, reflecting a bold but playful room that fits within the historic building’s architecture. Pinboard panels line the lower bar area while numbered light fixtures on tabletops and on hanging lamps make it easier for service staff. Lustig plans to serve late, at least 11 p.m. and up until midnight with a late-night menu that will start at 10 p.m. after the soft opening period is over within a few weeks. Mairinger is fond of restaurants committed to helping service industry folks and night owls enjoy a quality meal after their shifts and hopes Lustig becomes a destination for late-night dining at a time when many restaurants are cutting back on hours. Additionally, Lustig will soon open for a kiosk-style breakfast and casual lunch service. [Lustig](https://lustig-la.com/) is open 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. (kitchen closes at 10 p.m. during soft opening), Tuesday to Saturday, with eventual breakfast and lunch service at 3273 Helms Avenue, Culver City, CA 90232. Closed all major holidays.",

Picture: Alamy By Kit Heren\n@yung_chuvak Staff in Angela Rayner's own department have voted to go on strike after being told to come into the office more often.\nListen to this article Loading audio... Union members at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local government backed industrial action four to one, on a two-thirds turnout.\nThe Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union's strike was due to office closures, and in response to \"rigid office attendance policies\".\nCivil servants were told in October that they must be in the office at least 60% of the time, which works out at three days per week for most people.\nThe government plans to close offices in Birmingham, Exeter, Newcastle, Sheffield, Truro, and Warrington over the next two years.\nRead more: Angela Rayner insists there were no plans for 'personal safari tour' during official trip to Ethiopia\nRead more: Labour's worker's rights reforms to have 'net negative' impact on the economy, says OBR\nCaller Jason tells Tom Swarbrick 'the real reason' he thinks CEOs want people back in the office\nThe department is also set to open offices in London, Wolverhampton, Darlington, Manchester and Bristol. All staff will be given the opportunity to relocate.\nIt comes as Ms Rayner, who is also deputy Prime Minister, tries to get her sweeping Employment Rights Bill passed into law.\nThe PCS said that the closures \"threaten the livelihoods\" of some of its members and also remove jobs from \"some of the most deprived areas in the country.\"\nThe union's general secretary Fran Heathcote said: “These office closures not only threaten the livelihoods of our members but also remove the presence of the government department responsible for local communities from some of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\"As the main face of the Employment Rights Bill, the Deputy Prime Minister must match her words with action and listen to her own workers.\nAngela Rayner. Picture: Alamy \"Members are deeply concerned about how these closures may affect their ability to rebuild local government, promote regional development and deliver on Labour’s mission to build 1.5 million new homes.\n\"They stand ready to strike to defend their offices, their communities, and their employment rights.\"\nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"We will continue to engage with unions and staff about a number of proposals - including plans to expand five offices outside of London and close six offices over the next two years, as leases come to an end.\n\"The department will continue to have offices in every English region as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and all staff affected will be able to continue in their roles in one of these locations.\"\nAngela Rayner joins Tom Swarbrick as Labour announces £2 billion for affordable housing | Watch in full\nIt comes after the fiscal watchdog warned that Ms Rayner's Employments Rights Bill would have a \"net negative impact\" on the economy.\nLabour last year revealed a major package of reforms under the Employment Rights Bill, hailed as the biggest boost to pay and productivity in the workplace in a generation.\nBut according to the the Office for Budget Responsibility's economic and fiscal outlook for March 2025, the economy will take a hit as a result.\nThe OBR wrote: \"Employment regulation policies that affect the flexibility of businesses and labour markets or the quantity and quality of work will likely have material, and probably net negative, economic impacts on employment, prices, and productivity.\n\"Given these potentially significant impacts, we will incorporate a central estimate of the aggregate impacts of the policy package in our next forecast.\"\nLatest Donald Trump News Greenland PM brands Usha Vance and US delegation's visit a 'provocation' as anti-Trump protestors swarm streets 'It's a lot of stuff' - Trump releases 80,000 classified pages relating to JFK assassination, honouring campaign promise Trump says 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico 'will go forward' in March after month-long delay 'Two shooters' involved in JFK assassination, claims task force head - as FBI reveals thousands of secret files Trump to host Netanyahu in Washington marking first foreign leader visit since US inauguration El Salvador offers to accept US deportees and criminals in 'unprecedented' migrant deal China announces retaliatory tariffs on US as Trump's levies take effect - but Canada and Mexico's are paused Trump pauses 25% tariffs on Canada for 30 days as President says call with Trudeau went 'very well' Britain will not choose between EU and US, says Starmer following Trump's tariff threats US trade tariffs on Mexico paused for a month after border deal Latest Politics News Judges reject Government's request to change 'corrosive' sentencing rules as 'two-tier justice' row erupts Northern England will no longer be 'held to ransom' by poor transport systems, says Starmer Australia to hold federal election in May as housing and inflation among key issues Donald Trump pushes for near-total control of Ukraine’s minerals and energy in huge increase on earlier demands Reform deputy says mental health is modern equivalent of ‘back pain’ - and disabled people are ‘swinging the lead’ I look forward to a statement that hits people like me, rather than those who can’t afford to eat, writes Andrew Marr Labour's worker's rights reforms to have 'net negative' impact on the economy, says OBR Online Islamophobic abuse targeting Sadiq Khan more than doubled last year, figures suggest Reeves 'to slash 50,000 civil service jobs' as she pushes to cut spending by £2 billion per year Starmer's ultimatum to councils: Prove you're tackling potholes or face losing cash",

He is ranked the No. 12 player in the class of 2025 by both On3 and 247Sports.\n“Coach Pope, I feel like he made a big commitment, took a lot of time and spoke a lot with me, so I feel like the trust was there between me and him and the coaching staff,” Johnson said at the live event where he announced his commitment. “Being from Lexington, Kentucky, I feel like that was an easy decision. I feel like I’m K.Y. till I die.”\nWith his commitment, Johnson becomes the second player in the 2025 recruiting class to commit to the Wildcats. Malachi Moreno , a four-star center from Great Crossing High School in Georgetown (Ky.), committed to Kentucky back on Aug. 16.\nJohnson is the son of former Kentucky football player Dennis Johnson, a defensive end who played for the Wildcats from 1998-2001 and was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2002 NFL Draft.\nFollow us @UKWildcatsWire on X and on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Kentucky Wildcats news, notes and opinions.",

Seguro que es capaz de decir que esos niños han sido vendidos y no puede pedirse su devolución o algo similar.\n[#6](c6#c-6) [#42](c42#c-42) [#46](c46#c-46)\nEn serio, por qué perdéis el tiempo con esta gente? Bloqueo y a vivir. Están aquí para joder, nada más.\nNo os llega con Ana Rosa, la Griso, Ferreras, Losantos, Herrera, ABC, El Mundo, etc? Aquí tenéis la oportunidad de taparles la boca a esta gentecilla que a saber por qué están aquí diciendo estas chorradas\n\"Según la organización pro derechos humanos Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, cerca de 500 bebés fueron robados por la dictadura a sus progenitores, en su mayoría opositores al régimen. En muchos casos, sostiene la organización, las madres que dieron a luz en centros clandestinos de detención y tortura, fueron desaparecidas para siempre, asesinadas o tiradas con vida al mar.\"\nengendros del averno\n[#52](c52#c-52) uff el cansino ese del mensaje kilométrico?\nEse también está entre mis excepciones, igual que el que repetía le mensaje en cada noticia del bitcoin.\nPero es que yo los insultos del calibre de este usuario es que debería estar baneado por el resto del los días.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Pero aún no tienes a ese ente en el ignore? si de cada 10 palabras 20 son insultos...\nLuego preguntan porqué meneame se va al garete..\n[#48](c48#c-48) No uso mucho el ignore, solo tengo a un usuario, el que no quiere hacer crecer a sus hijos en la miseria...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La cuestión es si es necesario un organismo solo para eso o puede derivarse a otro ya existente.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Vaya, qué sorpresa, uno de los seres con mayor nivel de miseria de esta web, y mira que el nivel es alto, alegrándose de que no puedan investigarse los secuestros de niños en una dictadura. Por lo que sea, eh?\nPues ya solo con el banco genético que ha creado ya tiene mayor utilidad que la que puedan tener 10000 seres como tú en 10000 vidas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) ¿Quién se ha alegrado de nada?\nResultados, hay un estudio genético, ok, ¿Cuales son los resultados?\nTu si que eres miserable...\nEl gobierno dice que el organismo actuaba \"por iniciativa propia, para la individualización de los responsables de posibles hechos criminales\"\nA los que defienden la libertad no les gusta que los organismos sean independientes, sobre todo estos organismos que TIENEN LA OBLIGACION de ser independientes de cualquier gobierno o ideología política.\nEspero que alguien viole la LOPD y ponga esos archivos a salvo\n[#56](c56#c-56) Si tienes empatía, dona a una ONG o asociación que realice esa tarea. Que yo no quiera que esto sea financiado coercitivamente/via impuestos no significa en absoluto que esté en contra de que se realice la tarea, de forma privada.\nLa empatía, con el dinero propio, no con el ajeno.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es lo que sospecho, se centran en el número de niños robados, los que reconocen ciertos organismos y los que reconoce el gobierno, pero ¿y los logros de este organismo? ¿cuál es la justificación del gasto? ¿Hay que soltar billetes aunque no haya resultados?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Ni de ti me esperaba defender semejante indignidad. Tiempo suficiente es todo el necesario para la resolución de todos los casos de un crimen tan atroz como es robar seres humanos. Y son cientos.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Semejante personaje despreciable. Como si fuera una \"investigación\" que tarda un tiempo concreto. Es un organismo que se encarga de hacer pruebas de ADN a la población para buscar familiares cercanos de gente que en la mayoría de los casos es por sospecha que puede ser un niño robado o los familiares terminan confesando...\nNo se puede caer más bajo que defender algo así.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No sé cómo te aguantas y llamas simplemente «indigno» a un saco de mierda así. En serio, todo mi respeto a tu templanza\n[#4](c4#c-4) Han tenido 20 años para investigar eso\nEso no es completamente cierto. En el artículo dicen claramente que fue fundada en el 92. No han tenido 20 años, han tenido 30.\nY teniendo en cuenta que 10 años antes ya estaba la Comisión Nacional por la Desaparición de Personas que hacía lo mismo y cuyas funciones luego asumió el organismo que ha cerrado Milei, en realidad han tenido 40 años.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Hace 40 años no habia la capacidad de hacer tests genéticos en cantidad, disponibilidad y coste como la que hay ahora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) Las pruebas genéticas para investigar la filiación con personas desaparecidas las lleva el Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos y son gratuitas. Para quien tiene sospechas de ser hijo/a de algún desaparecido, quien realmente resuelve el tema es está organización, a la que cualquiera puede acudir y que además lo hace de forma gratuita. No necesitas añadir una capa de burocracia adicional en forma de otra organización.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Nacional_de_Datos_Genéticos\n[#4](c4#c-4) Te voy a poner un ejemplo: España\nAquí hemos tenido 50 años (y contando) y todavía hay un montón de barbaridades que se hicieron en la dictadura de Franco que siguen sin saberse.\nY eso es así porque todavía hay gente viva y con poder, interesada en que no se sepa.\nY en Argentina, igual. Y esa gente con poder ha votado a Milei para que parara esas investigaciones, no sea que se descubra que algún heredero de una familia de bien resulta que tiene genes de rojo piojoso.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Precisamente. Este es de los que dice que no hay que reabrir heridas del pasado obviando que los delitos de lesa humanidad no prescriben\n[#50](c50#c-50) Viniendo del tío que llama fascistas a los que piden acabar con los difusores de fake news racistas, en realidad tu opinión respecto a esto se podía intuir. Has confirmado lo que pareces esmerarte en demostrar cada día; das asco. No eres más que otro ultra conservador sin escrúpulos, como tu máximo héroe, el sociópata Milei.",

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\nGot it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement FICTION\nChange\nÉdouard Louis\nVintage, $39.99\nÉdouard Louis came to prominence with his 2014 autofiction, The End of Eddy , an account of growing up gay and poor in the post-industrial north of France. There followed A History of Violence , about being raped and almost murdered by a man he picked up in the street, and two loving, ambivalent portraits of his parents, Who Killed My Father , which doubled as a denunciation of the neoliberal turn in French politics, and A Woman’s Battles and Transformations , about his mother’s late-life flourishing after she left Louis’ father.\nEdouard Louis’ novel is driven by negative emotions, shame and the need for absolution. Credit: Arnaud Delrue\nHis new book is billed as a novel, though let’s just call it autofiction: he flags the made-up bits. It, too, is about his transformations: about how that boy who didn’t always have enough to eat grew up to be a world-famous writer. If this sounds like an inspirational story about overcoming hardship, it isn’t. Instead, it is driven by negative emotions, shame and the need for absolution, just as the life it describes has been driven by shame and the need for revenge against poverty and homophobia: the revenge on shame. Self-justification is the very form. Change is addressed to those he left behind.\nAn epigraph to Change could be: wherever you go, there you are.\nThe first stage in the ascent is from the village to the nearest big town, Amiens. Here he attends senior high school, the first in his family to do so, and befriends Elena, a bourgeoisie who introduces him to the finer things. This section is addressed to his father: “I understood that the lycée was the beginning of our separation, with no going back.”\nNo longer Eddy, but Édouard, and at university, he meets the distinguished sociologist Didier Eribon, whose trajectory from the working class to the Paris intellectual gratin he is keen to emulate. Eribon encourages him to try for the École Normale Superiéure, alma mater of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Chasing the cultural capital Elena and her milieu take for granted, he turns himself into a reading machine.\nLoading About this, Louis is unsentimental: “I don’t like stories about childhoods saved by books and reading. I find them naive.” But you could say he is saved from this naivete by one of the first books he encounters: Pierre Bourdieu’s Distinction , a sociological masterwork whose argument is that high culture is irredeemably complicit with hierarchy and prestige.\nThe friendship with Eribon causes a break with Elena and other people from Amiens turn against him once he has the bad taste to get into the ENS. All of a sudden, he is “egotistical, ambitious”. Louis has trouble disagreeing, though he also has trouble agreeing. By now he is speaking to Elena, not his father. When Louis talks about his snobbish affectations or increasingly transactional relationships, the tone at times is plaintive, at times somewhere between squirminess and bluff: “Maybe I said some things I didn’t mean … It wasn’t cynicism that made me say those things, but the need – almost the desperation – to be helped … Is it forbidden to like someone for the protection they can give you?“\nAdvertisement If he was once ashamed of his background, he is now ashamed about what he did to escape that background. An epigraph to Change could be: wherever you go, there you are.\nLouis certainly goes places. If he sometimes seems like a provincial hero of a classic French novel, out to conquer the capital, he has also by now become like Zola’s Nana. In Paris he hooks up with men on the internet who pay him for sex; on a higher scale of payment, wealthy, cultivated men take him to Bayreuth. Soon enough he is socialising with princesses, and the descendants of great industrialist families. Unlike his literary forebears, this adventurer, however, is not crushed by society, or Society. Louis’s comeuppance is self-alienation.\nHe learns that the rich are awful; not only do they have Picassos on the wall, they have sofas covered in polar bear fur, and are rude to the help. (Afterwards he tells Eribon an ingratiating, self-flattering story about coming to the defence of that insulted employee; speaking on the page to Eribon, self-abasingly, he admits he made it up and like any old coward actually kept silent.)\nNor does his subsequent literary celebrity seem any more satisfying: “At first this life awed me, and then it left me jaded and disgusted.” Of course there is no going back. “I’m not nostalgic about poverty, but about the possibility of the present. Or rather: I hated my childhood and I miss my childhood.”\nYet Louis has found the way to try to resolve these conflicts. Like Annie Ernaux, an acknowledged influence, who called her Nobel lecture I Will Write To Avenge My People , he has used his writing as an intervention to confront the issue of class, the abiding embarrassment of the contemporary left.\nThe Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

Caroline Lian worked for the District’s Department of Buildings for almost two years. She was hired as Chief Operations Officer in 2022 and promoted to Deputy Director in 2023. A report from the District of Columbia’s Board of Ethics and Government Accountability Office revealed she was working full-time with Freddie Mac where she made six figures. The report detailed how Lian had a hybrid schedule for both jobs which allowed her to work from home or in the office on different days of the week.

Lian has agreed to pay a $25,000 fine to the city for violating its code of ethics. Falls Church officials said they reported the incident to the Commonwealth’s Attorney for investigation.",
