    "text": "\"E' una grande giornata per i nostri Colli Euganei: oggi hanno conquistato il riconoscimento Unesco. Sono stati iscritti nella Lista delle Riserve Mondiali della Biodiversità: luoghi esemplari in cui lo sviluppo economico, sociale e culturale è sostenibile e trae giovamento dal rispetto dell'ecosistema e della biodiversità\". Così il presidente della Regione del Veneto Luca Zaia annuncia l'esito dell'incontro del Consiglio intergovernativo dell'Unesco riunito in questi giorni ad Agadir in Marocco, che ha decretato l'iscrizione del sito veneto dei Colli Euganei nella Lista Mab dell'Unesco.\n La decisione è stata presa all'unanimità dai delegati dei 35 Stati membri del Consiglio intergovernativo in rappresentanza degli oltre 180 Stati parte del programma Mab dell'Unesco. La rete delle Riserve mondiali Mab Unesco si compone di 748 siti in tutto il mondo di cui 20 in Italia. Sono luoghi vivi e unici al mondo, in cui è possibile assicurare uno sviluppo eco-compatibile e un ambiente vivibile in un contesto globale caratterizzato da processi di rapida urbanizzazione e di eccessivo consumo energetico considerati come fattori scatenanti dei cambiamenti climatici.\n Con il risultato di oggi, il Veneto arriva a 18 riconoscimenti Unesco conquistando il record nazionale: 9 siti patrimonio materiale (da Venezia a Verona, da Vicenza a Padova, dalle Dolomiti a Conegliano e Valdobbiadene, dai siti palafitticoli alle opere di difesa veneziane), 5 patrimoni immateriali (Arte delle perle di vetro, Tocatì, Transumanza, Muretti a secco, Opera lirica), 4 riserve Mab (Po Grande, Delta del Po, Monte Grappa, Colli Euganei). Per i Colli ora si aprono nuovi scenari, siamo pronti ad un grande progetto di promozione e sviluppo. \"La candidatura dei Colli Euganei è stata avanzata a settembre 2023 dal presidente del Comitato Nazionale Mab Unesco, professor Pier Luigi Petrillo che ringrazio - ricorda il presidente Zaia -. Nel documento si evidenziavano le caratteristiche dei Colli Euganei che vantano un paesaggio spettacolare caratterizzato da un gruppo di 81 pittoresche colline vulcaniche di altezza variabile da 300 metri a 600 metri nella Pianura Padovano-Veneta a sud-ovest della città di Padova, tra cui il Monte Venda, la collina più alta della regione, oltre a centri termali e a una rigogliosa pianura agricola con numerosi uliveti e vigneti. Il dossier, promosso dal Parco regionale dei Colli Euganei, è stato seguito passo dopo passo dalla regione Veneto che ha sempre creduto in questo progetto\".",

    "title": "Gov.-elect Braun keeps Indiana’s education secretary, recruits familiar face for commerce",
    "text": "Gov.-elect Braun keeps Indiana’s education secretary, recruits familiar face for commerce\nINDIANAPOLIS (Indiana Capital Chronicle) - In his second round of leadership picks, Gov.-elect Mike Braun announced Thursday he will retain Katie Jenner as Indiana’s education head, and bring on former state official David Adams as commerce secretary.\nORIGINAL REPORT: [Gov.-elect Braun keeps Indiana’s education secretary, recruits familiar face for commerce](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/12/05/gov-elect-braun-keeps-indianas-education-secretary-recruits-familiar-face-for-commerce/)\nThe announcement came one day after Braun, a Republican, [confirmed his choices](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/12/05/indiana-gov-elect-mike-braun-announces-first-appointments/) for the state’s next budget and transportation secretaries.\nJenner has served as Indiana’s secretary of education since 2021. Braun lauded her leadership thus far, including her oversight over the state’s largest-ever investment in literacy, as well as her work “implementing a comprehensive teacher supply/demand marketplace, and increasing the statewide graduation rate.”\nJenner’s administration additionally launched [Indiana’s Graduates Prepared to Succeed](https://indianagps.doe.in.gov/) initiative, which seeks to redefine how the state measures school performance and student achievement.\nJenner was hand-picked by Gov. Eric Holcomb to take on the role after the superintendent of public instruction position was eliminated by the General Assembly. Jennifer McCormick — who ran as a Democrat against Braun in the 2024 gubernatorial race — was the last to hold that office.\n“Dr. Jenner’s proven track record of elevating Indiana’s education system makes her the ideal choice to continue leading our state’s academic initiatives,” Braun said in a Thursday news release. “Her focus on literacy, STEM education, and workforce readiness aligns perfectly with our vision for Indiana’s future.”\nThe state’s top school official currently leads the Indiana Department of Education and chairs the State Board of Education. She previously served as Holcomb’s senior education advisor, vice president of K-12 initiatives and statewide partnerships at Ivy Tech Community College, and held various leadership positions at Madison Consolidated Schools, in addition to being a teacher.\nBraun’s transition team said Jenner will focus on college and career readiness, improved literacy and math outcomes, universal school choice, and an increase in teacher base pay — all part of his incoming administration’s agenda.\n“I am grateful to Governor-elect Braun for the opportunity to continue serving Indiana’s students, educators, and families as Secretary of Education,” Jenner said in a statement. “Over the past several years, we have made significant strides in expanding educational opportunities and ensuring our students are prepared for success in the classroom and beyond. Working together with Governor-elect Braun, our dedicated teachers, school leaders, the General Assembly and stakeholders across the state, we will build upon this progress while addressing the evolving needs of our education system. I look forward to advancing this vital mission in the years ahead.”\nSeparately, Adams is slated to become Indiana’s next secretary of commerce. He’ll be tasked with leading Indiana’s job creation and business growth initiatives. That entails “driving economic opportunity for the state and fostering an entrepreneurial environment for innovation,” Braun’s transition team noted.\nAdams, who previously served as the state’s commissioner of workforce development, “brings extensive experience in economic development, innovation, and business growth,” Braun’s team said.\n“David’s proven track record of driving economic growth and innovation makes him the ideal choice to lead Indiana’s commerce initiatives,” Braun said. “His experience in workforce development to drive economic growth, combined with his successful entrepreneurial business track record and ability to attract major investments, will help accelerate Indiana’s economic momentum.”\nAdams was appointed to run the Department of Workforce Development in August 2022 but departed eight months later. The release at the time didn’t say why he was leaving but said he would serve instead on the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet.\nBraun emphasized that, under Adams’ leadership as workforce development commissioner, Indiana’s workforce ranking in CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” improved from 48th to 14th.\nEarlier, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, Adams led the turnaround and merger of Indiana’s nearly $50B pension systems.\nHe previously served as chief innovation officer at the University of Cincinnati, where he led the development of the Cincinnati Innovation District that became Ohio’s model for economic development, per Braun’s team.\nAdams was also a founding member of the leadership team for i2 Technologies, a software company that specialized in supply chain management. The company was sold in 2010. He currently serves on the Purdue Research Foundation board and is a Forbes contributing writer.\n“Governor-elect Braun’s vision for our state’s economic future is bold and one that I look forward to supporting as Secretary of Commerce,” Adams said in a statement. “His business career gives him a unique perspective of workforce development and economic prosperity, and while we have great momentum as a state, there is more work to be done. We have an opportunity ahead of us to recruit and build a talent pipeline, and I look forward to working with Governor-elect Braun and the General Assembly to take our state to new heights.”\nCopyright 2024 WPTA.

    "text": "Chevy S10 SS was already equipped with a 5.3L LS V8, but it’s got quite a bit more punch now thanks to this fresh swap. As many Bow Tie fans undoubtedly remember , GM offered a performance-focused version of its compact pickup – dubbed the Chevy S10 SS – from 1994-1998, though only a few thousand were built in each of those model years. The Chevy S10 SS got the 4.3-liter Vortec V6 as standard – making between 180-200 horsepower depending on the year – along with a two-inch lowered suspension, unique bodywork, and the ZQ8 Sport Suspension package. However, the folks behind the YouTube channel Bluu Racing recently opted to give their S10 SS a bit more in terms of motivation.\nIn this 12-ish minute long video, we get to see those folks swap a 6.0-liter LS V8 into their Chevy S10 SS, in fact, right after the donor block was cleaned up by a local machine shop. The block also got new cam bearings, along with a crank from a 5.3-liter powerplant.\nThe pistons and bearings go in next, after which it’s time to get this mill installed in its new home. This is a pretty easy process, but our host notes that you’ll want to be careful not to hit the crossmember if it isn’t notched, and in this case, not having the heads and headers in installed beforehand makes the process easier.\nDespite this, the oil pan doesn’t have a ton of clearance, but if it fits, its ships, as they say. With the heads on, we can see there’s a clearance issue with the valve covers and coil pack, however. Next up is the fueling system, which our host runs new lines for, after which he installs the new Holley EFI setup on top, as well as the headers. After all of this is complete, it’s time to test fire the new engine, and it starts right up with no hesitation.\nNow, it’s time to button everything up by installing a new driveshaft, and take the thing for a test drive – which reveals that the brakes on this Chevy S10 SS aren’t exactly ready to handle all the newfound power it has.\nRegardless, this compact pickup is now much gnarlier than even before – it already had a 5.3 swap prior to this change – but the owner has plumbed in a shot of nitrous as well, just in case he needs it. All of this work ultimately pays off at the end of the clip, as we get to see this pickup run an impressive 11.39-second quarter-mile at 118 mph – not too shabby, we’d say.\nJoin the Chevrolet Forums now!",

    "text": "Marrakech: The Shura Council emphasized Qatar's commitment and eagerness to support startups, provide promising investment opportunities, and foster entrepreneurship.\nThis came in a speech by the Member of the Shura Council and Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean HE Abdullah bin Nasser bin Turki Al Subaie, during the second session of the Marrakesh Economic Parliamentary Forum for the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions, organized by the Parliament in cooperation with the House of Councilors of the Kingdom of Morocco.\nHE Al Subaie said that Qatar has made significant strides in supporting projects and startups and providing investment opportunities through the development of laws and the facilitation of procedures, pointing to the efforts of Qatar Development Bank in this field.\nHe explained that the bank finances projects and provides part of the initial studies to help entrepreneurs make the right investment decisions, in addition to rewarding successful and outstanding projects, and promoting women's participation in economic activity.\nHe highlighted the state's encouragement of the entry of specialized foreign investment companies into the Qatari market, and its recent reduction of all service fees provided to the trade, industry, and business development sectors by more than 90 percent to encourage capital investment in various economic fields.\nIn his speech, His Excellency touched on Qatar's efforts to enhance cooperation with international organizations and bodies concerned with environmental and climate change issues, referring to the agreements ratified by the state in this regard.\nHe also discussed the obstacles to integration among the region's countries and the challenges of promoting economic development, mentioning the energy crisis, disruptions in food supply chains due to climate change, the ongoing impact of pandemics, and wars in the countries from which the region imports food. He emphasized the urgent need for structural economic reform and the reform of the current international financial system to align with the evolution of the economy and its needs.\nHis Excellency stressed the responsibility of parliaments to address these challenges, saying that parliaments have a responsibility to confront all these challenges, find solutions, and provide the material and human resources to implement and monitor them, which necessitates the need for cooperation and coordination between parliaments and legislative institutions, involving the private sector, empowering women and youth, and promoting sustainable development, and the governance of modern technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nHe added that parliamentarians look forward to this platform as a leading regional center for parliamentary work in the transition to green energy, supporting investments and small projects.\"\nHE Al Subaie began his speech at the forum by referring to the recent tragic events in Gaza in light of the ongoing brutal and heinous war waged by the occupying entity on the sector, which has resulted in thousands of martyrs and wounded, most of them women and children, and the destruction of infrastructure in full view of the world.\nHe reaffirmed Qatar's firm and supportive stance for the right of the Palestinian people to live with dignity on their land and to establish their independent state within the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions.\nThe Marrakech Economic Parliamentary Forum, held over two days, discusses the relationship between securing energy supplies and transitioning to green energy, supporting entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises, addressing challenges, and achieving clean and sustainable energy. It focuses on regional solutions to support entrepreneurship, economic growth, and connectivity across the Euro-Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf regions.\nThe forum is attended by political and economic officials representing the public and private sectors, as well as experts and academics specializing in the forum's topics and representatives of civil society.\n© Dar Al Sharq Press, Printing and Distribution.

    "text": "Small business owners are rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to power their growth, with many saying it will lead to more job opportunities this year, according to a Goldman Sachs survey.About 68% of small business owners say they are already using AI, with another 9% planning to begin using it within the next year, according to new data from Goldman's 10,000 Small Businesses Voices survey. It's a significant jump from the 51% of small business owners who were using the technology to increase productivity and expand their capabilities two years ago. Most small businesses using AI, about 80%, said it is enhancing rather than replacing their workforce. About 74% of small business owners using AI plan to grow their business in 2025. That compares to 65% of those not using AI or unsure about adoption. Nearly 40% of small businesses using the technology say it will allow them to create new jobs in 2025. AIRBNB APOLOGIZES AFTER 'SUPERHOST' ALLEGEDLY USED AI-DOCTORED PHOTOS TO CLAIM $16K IN FAKE DAMAGES This comes as public anxiety grows over whether AI will replace jobs. According to a 2025 Pew Research Center survey, more than 60% of Americans believe AI will result in fewer jobs over the next 20 years. However, about 80% of the small businesses that have already adopted the technology say it increased the efficiency and productivity of the company. Over 50% say they have been given better data for decision-making, with another 49% saying it helped offer new capabilities, according to the survey. The OpenAI logo is displayed on a mobile phone screen. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images / Getty Images) Still, despite the rapid adoption , about 42% of small businesses say they still don't have access to the resources and expertise necessary to successfully deploy it. Of those businesses, 60% cite a lack of expertise in applying AI to their business. However, 42% say it’s not relevant to their business model, highlighting an information and resource gap. Those who have adopted technology for their business have still confronted challenges, with 48% saying they are struggling to choose the right tools, 46% express concerns about data privacy and security, and 41% cite a lack of technical expertise. GOOGLE COMMITS $1B TO TRAIN US COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OVER THREE YEARS Workday posted a blog earlier this year, highlighting how AI is becoming the standard for modern small businesses, and that AI is critical to helping small businesses create efficient workforce management to stay productive without overburdening staff.

For small businesses in particular, \"artificial intelligence is leveling the playing field with larger organizations, offering new levels of scalability and productivity that may have once felt unattainable,\" Workday added.

    "text": "Lesión de Luka Sucic: qué tiene y cuánto tiempo estará de baja\nEl centrocampista de la Real sufrió una entrada muy dura y se vio obligado a salir del terreno de juego por molestias en su tobillo derecho.\nLa Real Sociedad ha recibido un duro golpe en el partido de vuelta de dieciseisavos de final de la Europa League ante el FC Midtjylland. Luka Sucic, centrocampista croata que había sido una de las figuras destacadas del encuentro con un doblete en la primera mitad, se vio obligado a abandonar el campo apenas iniciada la segunda parte tras una acción desafortunada. Justo en el minuto 48, sufrió una entrada que provocó una preocupante torcedura en su tobillo derecho, dejando la sensación de que podría tratarse de una lesión de consideración. En su lugar, Imanol Alguacil dio entrada a Pablo Marín, quien sustituyó a su compañero lesionado.\nLa Real Sociedad afronta un calendario exigente en las próximas semanas, con partidos clave tanto en LaLiga como en Copa del Rey. La posible baja de Sucic llega en un momento delicado, ya que el equipo se enfrenta al Leganés este 23 de febrero, al Real Madrid en las semifinales de Copa el 26 de febrero y al FC Barcelona el 1 de marzo en Liga. La lesión del croata podría modificar los planes de Imanol Alguacil en un tramo crucial de la temporada.\n¿Qué lesión tiene Luka Sucic?\nLuka Sucic sufrió un fuerte golpe en el tobillo derecho tras una entrada rival que le provocó una torcedura significativa. A pesar de la dureza de la acción, el jugador abandonó el campo por su propio pie, aunque visiblemente afectado. Las imágenes del lance han generado inquietud, ya que la torsión no es menor y podría tratarse de un esguince de tobillo. Sin embargo, será necesario esperar a las pruebas médicas para conocer el alcance exacto de la lesión.\n¿Cuánto tiempo estará de baja Luka Sucic?\nAunque aún no hay un diagnóstico oficial, el tipo de acción y la forma en la que se produjo la lesión hacen pensar que Sucic podría estar fuera de los terrenos de juego al menos durante unos días o semanas, dependiendo de la gravedad del esguince. Si el daño es leve, podría llegar al duelo contra el FC Barcelona el 1 de marzo, pero si se trata de una lesión más seria, su presencia en los próximos encuentros se vería comprometida.\n¿Qué hacer con Luka Sucic en LALIGA FANTASY?\nEn LaLiga Fantasy, Luka Sucic tiene un valor de 35,5 millones, por lo que una posible baja prolongada lo convertiría en una venta obligada. Si las pruebas confirman que no estará disponible para el partido ante el Barcelona, deshacerse de él cuanto antes sería la mejor decisión para evitar perder valor de mercado y buscar alternativas en el mercado Fantasy.",
