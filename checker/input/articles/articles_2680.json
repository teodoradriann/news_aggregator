    "title": "Bill to reward pandemic fraud whistleblowers highlights claw back challenges | National | thecentersquare.com",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – A bill designed to help authorities claw back federal pandemic aid lost to fraud underscores the challenges associated with getting money back after it has been sent out. The Congressional Budget Office estimated [H.R. 7129](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7129/all-actions) could bring in $123 million through new civil penalties over the next decade, but the report highlighted uncertainty about how much of that money would realistically be collected. The Office of Inspector General has estimated that the Small Business Administration gave out $200 billion in fraudulent COVID-19 loans. A fraction of that amount has been recovered. For cases of COVID-19 loan fraud between March 2020 and March 2024, the government has collected $1.2 billion in asset forfeitures and recoveries, according to the OIG and CBO [report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60409). In addition, $673 million in restitution and $4 million in fines were ordered, but not necessarily collected. \"The SBA has not provided CBO with information on the amounts of COVID loans involved in convictions, settlements, or plea agreements,\" according to the report. \"As a result, CBO cannot determine the amount of fraudulent loans that have been recovered, nor the civil or criminal penalties that have been collected rather than merely imposed.\" H.R. 7129 would establish the Office of Whistleblower Awards within the Small Business Administration. The office would collect information from the public about financial misconduct related to certain COVID relief loan and grant programs and submit that information to the SBA's Office of Inspector General. The measure also would direct the Treasury to establish a Whistleblower Award Fund for civil monetary penalties and other amounts collected when the information leads to a conviction, settlement, or plea agreement. The whistleblower would receive a portion of the amount recovered from information they provided if certain conditions are met. For any conviction, settlement, or plea agreement for fraud related to loans or grants for COVID relief, H.R. 7129 would impose a new civil monetary penalty equal to 30% of the grant or principal amounts of the relevant loans. Those new civil penalties would bring in an estimated $123 million over the next decade. But there are some caveats. \"The additional civil monetary penalties that would be collected under the bill depend on future convictions and recoveries related to fraud in the SBA's COVID relief programs,\" according to the CBO report. \"The number of fraud cases that will be successfully prosecuted in the future is uncertain, as is the share of ordered penalties that the government will actually collect.\" The bill also comes with costs. It would increase direct spending by $15 million over the next decade. CBO estimated it would cost $9 million over the 2024-2034 period to administer the office and another $6 million in payments to whistleblowers. Operating the newly-minted office would cost about $1 million a year or roughly $250,000 per year per employee for four employees. The measure has 16 co-sponsors, but has yet to advance in the legislature.",

    "text": "Luxembourg Le ministère d'État dénonce une publication anti-Israël de Dylan Thiry LUXEMBOURG - En charge de la lutte contre l'antisémitisme, le ministère de Luc Frieden a dénoncé à Bee Secure un message de l'influenceur Dylan Thiry appelant à «la fin d'Israël». - par - Thomas Holzer Le ministère d'État de Luc Frieden a dénoncé sur la plateforme «Bee Secure Stopline» la publication sur le réseau social X (ex-Twitter) de l'influenceur luxembourgeois Dylan Thiry appelant à la destruction de l'État d'Israël, a indiqué le gouvernement à L'essentiel, jeudi. La vedette de la téléréalité aux 1,7 million d'abonnés sur Instagram avait publié mercredi une photo montrant le drapeau palestinien déchirant celui d'Israël avec la mention «The end of Israel» (La fin d'Israël). Une illustration accompagnée du commentaire: «Si Dieu le veut, ça arrive». La publication est restée en ligne quelques dizaines de minutes avant d'être supprimée par son auteur. «\"Bee Secure Stopline\" permet de signaler tout propos ou contenu en ligne susceptible de contrevenir aux lois en matière de pédopornographie, de racisme, de révisionnisme, de discrimination ou de terrorisme. Les signalements sont transmis aux autorités de poursuite. Eu égard aux indices tangibles en sa possession, le ministère d’État a opéré un tel signalement par la voie de la plateforme», a justifié le gouvernement du Grand-Duché. Un plan d'action national de lutte contre l'antisémitisme avait été présenté par l'ancien Premier ministre Xavier Bettel, en septembre dernier, avec la volonté affichée de «se donner des structures pérennes pour mieux lutter» contre le phénomène. Interrogé par L'essentiel sur une éventuelle maladresse puisque le message a été supprimé, Dylan Thiry a assumé sa position sur le fond: «Israël est un État terroriste. Il faut qu’ils arrêtent de tuer des innocents. Ça fait maintenant 75 ans que ça dure. Aucun pays ne fait quoi que ce soit pour que ça s’arrête. C’est une honte, et l’humanité se rappellera de ce massacre à vie». Mercredi, le parquet du Luxembourg expliquait ne pas avoir été saisi, jusqu'à présent, d'une éventuelle plainte ou dénonciation.

    "text": "Supreme Court rules against fired pro-union Starbucks workers The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-367_f3b7.pdf) that a federal court improperly granted a preliminary injunction to reinstate several employees who were fired after they invited a news crew onto store property for a union-related news story. The high court determined that the injunction did not meet the established four-question test traditionally used to determine if injunctive relief is necessary. What are the four questions of this standard? The four questions originated in the Supreme Court’s 2008 ruling in [Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep555/usrep555007/usrep555007.pdf) Federal courts must consider: Whether the party seeking the preliminary injunction is likely to succeed at trial; Whether that party will suffer irreparable harm if they don’t receive an injunction before going to trial; Whether the balance of equities tips in that party's favor—or, essentially, whether granting the injunction would burden the other party more than the absence of an injunction would burden the party requesting the injunction; Whether the preliminary injunction is in the public’s interest. How did this become an issue before the court? The National Labor Relations Board is authorized to investigate tips it receives that employers are not treating their employees fairly. If the board determines that the tips are legitimate and unfair treatment is taking place, the NLRB brings charges against the employer—charges that are tried internally within the agency. Federal appeals courts can then review the NLRB’s decisions. While trying cases within itself, the NLRB can seek preliminary injunctions against employers taking certain actions. Starbucks workers at a shop in Memphis were among some of the first employees to begin forming a union against the company—which is the biggest coffee shop chain in the world, according to the Court. The workers invited a local news station to cover their union efforts at the store after-hours. The chain eventually fired several of the employees, alleging they violated company policy. The workers appealed to the NLRB. The Board sought a preliminary injunction against Starbucks, ordering the company to reinstate the workers. The district court granted the request, and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision. But both the district court and the Sixth Circuit used a two-pronged standard of review in assessing whether the preliminary injunction was appropriate. Starbucks appealed, saying that the courts should have used the four-question standard of review the Supreme Court put forward in Winters. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to set the record straight about what standard should be used in reviewing whether preliminary injunctions are appropriate. What happens now? The Supreme Court ordered that the district court review the preliminary injunction request using the four-question Winters standard.

    "title": "Harvey Weinstein has had a huge court victory, reversing a landmark #MeToo ruling. Here's why he won - ABC News",
    "text": "Brad Ryan in Washington DC, wires New York's highest court has overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction. The Court of Appeals found the trial judge made serious legal errors that unfairly prejudiced the disgraced filmmaker. Weinstein's [successful appeal](/news/2024-04-25/harvey-weinstein-rape-conviction-overturned-by-appeals-court/103770576) is a blow to the #MeToo movement against powerful men who prey on vulnerable women, undoing one of its historic breakthrough moments. What was Weinstein convicted of? In February 2020, Weinstein was found guilty of the sexual assault of production assistant Mimi Haleyi, and the third-degree rape of actress Jessica Mann. The trial heard evidence Weinstein – who made his name with films like The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love – was a serial predator who abused his status and power in Hollywood to manipulate women. Haleyi said Weinstein invited her to an apartment in 2006, for what she thought was a meeting about her career. When she was there, she said, he pushed her onto a bed and forced oral sex on her. Mann said Weinstein blocked her from leaving his hotel room, forced her to undress and raped her in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. He was acquitted on two counts of predatory sexual assault, though. Those offences carried a potential life sentence. Weinstein's arrest, in 2018, followed Pulitzer-winning pieces in The New York Times and The New Yorker that exposed his alleged misconduct. More than 100 women have publicly aired allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Why was the conviction overturned? The court found the trial judge made an error by allowing several other women to testify against Weinstein, even though their assault claims were not part of the official case against him. They included costume designer Dawn Dunning, model Tarale Wulff and actress Lauren Young. The three women all said Weinstein lured them to his room and attacked them. [Annabella Sciorra](/news/2020-01-24/actress-annabella-sciorra-says-harvey-weinstein-raped-her/11897218), an actress from The Sopranos, also testified during the trial. She said Weinstein barged into her apartment and raped her in the mid-1990s – too long ago to be charged. The court ruled that, by allowing the extra witnesses to testify, the trial judge committed an \"abuse of judicial discretion\": \"Under our system of justice, the accused has a right to be held to account for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of bad prior acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality.\" The trial judge made another error, the court found, by allowing the prosecution to cross-examine Weinstein about evidence of other past bad behaviour – things like throwing food and staplers at people, punching his brother at a business meeting and photoshopping an actress's head onto another woman's naked body without permission: \"Without question, this is appalling, shameful, repulsive conduct that could only diminish defendant's character before the jury. But [the legal precedent of] Sandoval does not legitimise destroying a defendant's character under the guise of prosecutorial need.\" Facing cross-examination on those things, Weinstein decided not to take the stand in his defence, which \"undermined the fact-finding process in this case\", the court found. Was it a unanimous decision? No – this decision split the court 3-4. One of the judges, Madeline Singas, wrote a passionate dissenting decision that included a warning: \"Men who serially sexually exploit their power over women – especially the most vulnerable groups in society – will reap the benefit of today's decision.\" Judge Singas argued that a defendant's intentions and awareness of a lack of consent were often difficult to prove, and past evidence of assaults was relevant to his likely state of mind. \"By ignoring the legal and practical realities of proving a lack of consent, the majority [of judges] has crafted a naïve narrative: that within the most fraught and intimate settings, intent is readily apparent, and issues of consent easily ascertained. \"This conclusion deprives juries of the context necessary to do their work, forecloses the prosecution from using an essential tool to prove intent, ignores the nuances of how sexual violence is perpetrated and perceived, and demonstrates the majority's utter lack of understanding of the dynamics of sexual assault. \"Because New York's women deserve better, I dissent.\" So does Weinstein get out of jail? No. But he'll probably be moved. Weinstein is serving another sentence for raping another woman – Italian model-actress Evgeniya Chernyshova, who said Weinstein showed up at her hotel room during a 2013 film festival, talked his way inside and assaulted her. He was convicted of that offence in 2022 in Los Angeles. He's now expected to be transferred from New York to California to continue serving prison time there. What happens now? Weinstein is likely to face another trial. The Manhattan district attorney's office said in a statement: \"We will do everything in our power to retry this case and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault.\" A retrial would mean witnesses and alleged victim-survivors could be forced to relive their previous courtroom ordeals and give evidence again. Meanwhile, Weinstein is hoping to overturn his other conviction, too, on the grounds the Californian jury was told about his previous conviction in New York. An appeal in the California case is set for May 20. ABC/wires",
