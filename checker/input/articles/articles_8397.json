    "text": "Severe weather battered parts of the Pacific Northwest Thursday as forecasts showed a resurgence of heavy rain for a handful of southern and midwestern states. The wave of storms dampened travel plans after the Christmas holiday and contributed to hundreds of flight cancellations nationwide.\nA series of thunderstorms caused ground stops at both Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field Thursday afternoon. Amid what AAA predicted was to be the busiest holiday travel season on record, there were at least 264 flight cancellations out of DFW as of Thursday evening, accounting for 22% of all cancellations nationwide, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Another 550 flights out of DFW were delayed, accounting for 46% of all delays nationwide.\n“We have a connecting flight here from DFW to Tokyo for our second anniversary, and it’s been delayed 12 times. Communication has been poor,” Latoyia Pugh told CBS News.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott activated the state’s emergency response plan in preparation for the weather Thursday afternoon.\n“Texas is prepared to deploy all necessary resources to help local officials respond to severe weather threats,” Abbott said in a statement. “As Texans and out-of-state visitors begin traveling after the Christmas holiday, it’s crucial that everyone regularly monitor road conditions, make an emergency plan, and heed the guidance of state and local officials.”\nAt least one suspected tornado touched down near El Campo, Texas, Thursday evening, about 80 miles southwest of Houston. The most potent storms were covering a region from Shreveport, Louisiana, south to Beaumont, Texas, according to CBS News senior national weather correspondent Rob Marciano.\nEarlier, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth issued various watches and warnings for flash floods, dense fog, tornadoes, and thunderstorms in different parts of the region on Thursday morning. All the tornado watches and warnings had been canceled by Thursday night.\nMeanwhile, Oregon and Washington were expected to see moderate to heavy rainfall and a few thunderstorms Thursday, resulting in up to 3 inches of inundation spread across the area and potentially some flooding in places where the rain falls rapidly, according to a National Weather Service advisory. Mountain snow, high winds, and perilous surf were also expected.\nAt one point Thursday morning, almost 60,000 customers were without power in Washington and Oregon, according to the outage tracker FindEnergy.com. However, by Thursday night, that number was down to about 14,600 customers.\nThis is the latest iteration in a series of storms caused by an atmospheric river currently impacting the West Coast. The initial round in the Northwest is expected to move inland by Thursday afternoon, meteorologists said, offering the region a short reprieve before another bout of extreme weather arrives Thursday night in many of the same areas. The upcoming spell is expected to bring an additional inch or two of rainfall by Friday morning.",

    "text": "Local 120 Members Win Major Wage Increases, Stronger Pension, and New Job Protections\nMINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a credible strike threat, more than 230 drivers and warehouse workers at Sysco have ratified a strong new four-year collective bargaining agreement. The contract, secured by Teamsters Local 120, includes a 30 percent wage increase, expanded vacation time, increased pension contributions, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday. The new agreement also includes strong strike protections and new language to guard against job loss from automation.\n\"We made it clear to Sysco we were ready to walk if they didn't come to the table with a fair contract,\" said Andy Ketcher, a Sysco driver and Local 120 steward. \"Because we stood together, we won a deal that rewards our hard work and gives us the respect we deserve.\"\nSysco is one of the largest and most profitable food service companies in the United States. In 2024, it reported $1.95 billion in net profits — up more than 10 percent from the year prior. Just days before the deal, Local 120 members voted unanimously to authorize a strike, pressuring Sysco to return with a contract that reflects its record profits.\n\"This is a huge win for our members and their families,\" said Brandon Brink, a Local 120 business agent. \"Our members stood tall and didn't back down in the face of corporate greed. That solidarity delivered real results.\"\nTeamsters Local 120 proudly represents over 15,000 workers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

    "text": "An ex-NFL star blasted the theory that Taylor Swift has only been distracting Travis Kelce and his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. The Kansas City Chiefs tasted five losses out of the team's eight games this season, with the game against the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Day as the latest defeat. Swift, at that time, watched her beau play on the field again, and she was blasted for allegedly distracting the whole team instead of bringing something positive to them. Taylor Swift Is Not a Distraction, Ex-NFL Star Says Ex-NFL star Merril Hoge spoke to OutKick (via [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/taylor-swift-zero-travis-kelce-31757431?utm_source=mynewsassistant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embedded_search_item_mobile)) to comment on the spreading bizarre theory about Swift being a distraction to the Kansas City Chiefs. Aside from the latest game, the \"Lavender Haze\" singer was also present when the team lost against Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills. \"It's irrelevant,\" he said. \"That's a media twist. That's actually just to tell you how weak and stupid the media is and people are. It has nothing to do with the locker room. They've never been in the locker room, and they (the media) clearly don't understand the National Football League, the dynamics of winning on Sundays when you win, when you lose, the struggles that exist.\" Hoge added, \"Somebody who sings songs has zero to do with it.\" READ ALSO: [Daddy's Girl: Taylor Swift's Father Is Having 'Difficult Moment' Amid Engagement Rumors ](https://www.musictimes.com/articles/98803/20231218/daddys-girl-taylor-swifts-father-having-difficult-moment-amid-engagement.htm) The former Pittsburgh Steelers running back also applauded Swift's \"greatness and brilliance\" which led her to have the most successful albums. Thus, he reiterated that the singer has nothing to do with where the Kansas City Chiefs team is right now. His comment came after Fox Sports analyst Skip Bayless shared his thoughts about Swift's effect on the Kansas City Chiefs players' performance. \"Feels like it's about time to call Taylor Swift a distraction,\" he said. \"What do you think, Patrick? Andy? How about you, Travis?\" Meanwhile, Kelce has since broken his silence on the \"embarrassing\" defeat, saying they played offense while putting the defense higher and still did not see things go their way. Despite the recent label, Swift and Kelce showed off their budding romance in public by going out of the stadium hand-in-hand. Kansas City Star photojournalist Nick Wagner shared a [photo of the moment](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1S9tdRNlB-/), causing fans' hearts to skip a beat.

Sin embargo, no será una situación muy duradera ya que a partir de la tarde comenzará a gestarse un cambio de tiempo que dará paso a la estabilidad y las altas presiones, con las temperaturas en ascenso.\n«Seguirá haciendo frío y habrá inestabilidad durante este viernes, lo que posiblemente se traduzca en lluvias y tormentas en diferentes puntos de Andalucía, sobre todo en el litoral mediterráneo», explica a IDEAL José Miguel Viñas, meteorólogo de Meteored.

De hecho, aunque la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) avisa de «chubascos localmente fuertes y acompañados de tormenta» por la tarde los cielos comenzarán a despejarse y las temperaturas máximas rondarán los 15 grados en toda Andalucía, con las mínimas por encima de los 3 grados ya en toda la comunidad autónoma.\nJosé Miguel Viñas\nMeteorólogo de Meteored\nDe cara al fin de semana la situación de estabilidad irá a más: «Las máximas seguirán subiendo, no tendremos tanto frío y se impondrán las altas presiones». Los termómetros se acercarán a los 20 grados durante el día en toda Andalucía, mientras que las mínimas serán mucho más altas en todas las provincias a excepción de Granada, con 0 grados durante la noche.\nUna situación que volverá a repetirse el domingo, con temperaturas ligeramente más altas. Y que también tendrá continuidad durante la próxima semana. «No parece que venga un nuevo temporal invernal la semana que viene, la semana arrancará con dominio de altas presiones y temperaturas más normales para entrar en la recta final del año», finaliza Viñas.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n<a href=\"https://www.ideal.es/deportes/futbol/espana-vuelve-tener-mundial-futbol-48-anos-despues-de-1982-naranjito-candidatura-iberica-junto-a-marruecos-y-portugal-20241211152602-ntrc.html\">\nEspaña vuelve a tener un Mundial de fútbol que será el torneo más global de la historia\n</a>\nIsaac Asenjo y Álex Sánchez\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - ImmunoTech Inc. (AIM) Friday announced the Delaware Court ruled that the nomination notice submitted by an activist group was properly rejected for being invalid under the Company's Bylaws. The activist group was seeking to nominate three candidates for election to ImmunoTech's four-person Board of Directors.\nThe Company plans to adjourn the AGM until Friday, January 5, 2024 at 11:00 a.m ET.\nIn the pre-market session, the stock is up more than 7 percent, from the previous close of $0.48.\nThe AIM Board had unanimously determined that the Activist Group's nomination notice was invalid because it omitted key information and included misleading information, ignoring what the Company's Bylaws require to be disclosed.\nFurther to the ruling, the Company will disregard the activist Group's director nominations, and no proxies or votes in favor of their three nominees will be recognized at the AGM 2023.\nThomas Equels, CEO said, '...We are pleased that the Court has validated the Board's determination that the Activist Group omitted and misrepresented critical information related to its members' backgrounds and intentions for AIM.'\nCopyright(c) 2023 RTTNews.com.

    "text": "AMLO afirma que Zedillo es un \"representante de la oligarquía\" en México El presidente López Obrador describió a Zedillo como un defensor del neoliberalismo, mientras que él mismo aboga por la protección de las mayorías. CIUDAD DE MÉXICO.- En su conferencia matutina de prensa, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador afirmó que el expresidente [Ernesto Zedillo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/2024/01/25/ernesto-zedillo-pide-evitar-regresion-democratica/) representa a la oligarquía y que su administración presidencial, de 1994 al 2000, fue faccioso en lugar de democrático. Dicha declaración surge después de que Zedillo cuestionara el incremento del populismo en América Latina y se mostrara preocupado por una presunta regresión democrática en México. De este modo, el mandatario aseveró este jueves que el gobierno de Zedillo fue una fachada de la democracia en México, ya que se enfocó en rescatar a los sectores privilegiados en lugar de proteger al pueblo. Además, compartió que en su próximo libro, el cual será presentado en febrero, abordará dichas temáticas, incluyendo el respaldo a Zedillo por parte de aquellos sectores e individuos beneficiados durante su mandato en el país. Lo siguen apoyando a él, lo reconocen porque seguramente fueron los que lo invitaron, como no lo van apoyar si les entregó bienes del pueblo, de la nación, si los rescató de la crisis, el es un representante de la oligarquía”, detalló. A pesar de reconocer el derecho de Zedillo a expresarse, López Obrador destacó las diferencias ideológicas, describiendo a Zedillo como un defensor del neoliberalismo, mientras que él mismo aboga por la protección de las mayorías. Piensa como muchos otros que el populismo es paternalismo porque lo que se le da a los pobres, le llaman así paternalismo, populismo y lo que se le dan los de arriba ellos les llaman fomento o rescate”, afirmó. No coincidimos porque por ejemplo, cuando él estuvo de Presidente yo sostengo que no había democracia… porque la democracia es el gobierno del pueblo y para el pueblo, quien no gobernó para el pueblo, que gobernó para los de arriba y eso según la definición aristotélica, si somos rigurosos en los conceptuales se llama oligarquía con fachada de democracia, discurso democrático”.

    "title": "La fórmula de Cristina Toro y Carlos Mario para convertir a Águila Descalza en una máquina de hacer plata",
    "text": "Cristina Toro tenía 18 años y estudiaba Administración de Empresas en Eafit, así eso le pareciera muy aburridor. Si hubiera nacido en otro país, habría estudiado filosofía, literatura, pero en la Medellín de mediados de los años ochenta había que hacer empresa. Y a ella le tocó. Eso sí, en las prácticas empresariales, se torció. Inició una investigación teatral. Ninguno de sus compañeros pensó en que se podía hacer una tesis sobre el arte como empresa. Ella buscó la excusa y la encontró en\nCarlos Mario Aguirre.\nEn esa época, Carlos Mario Aguirre era un artista del hambre. Radical, solitario, conflictivo. Un lobo estepario. Vivía con su familia en el barrio Laureles de Medellín. Tenía una biblioteca inmensa que la había leído y releído varias veces, pero igual había hecho diabluras desde pequeño.\nFue compañero de infancia de Hernán Darío ‘Bolillo’ Gómez y de su hermano Gabriel Jaime ‘Barrabás’ Gómez. Estudió Licenciatura en literatura y Lengua Castellana en la\nUniversidad de Antioquia durante siete años y estaba convencido, cuando conoció a Cristina, que un artista tendría que pasar hambre con tal de lograr la perfección. No había nada que conceder. Cristina, en ese lejano 1982, se sintió intimidada, más que atraída, ante el genio.\nTres años después, lo vio durante una función en su teatro de Laureles donde presentó La cantante calva de Eugène Ionesco. Su grupo -en donde él era el su único integrante, por misántropo, por cansón- se llamaba El Águila Descalza, en honor a una película mexicana. Cristina acababa de llegar de Europa y fue a ver la obra con un amigo. Nadie más pagó la boleta.\nLa impresionó que él solo hiciera los seis personajes de la obra. Era un portento, pero no tenía idea de negocios. No había comunicados de prensa -él mismo los hacía- y él mismo cobraba las entradas. No era un negocio. Además, estaba el trago, la droga. Tomaba de todo lo que tuviera alcohol, perfumes, alcohol antiséptico, fumaba bazuco, metía hongos que lo dejaban alelado viendo las viejas esculturas de Henry Moore que tanto le gustaban y pensaba en el suicido.\nEra un bandido. Su tristeza la atenuaba cantando melodías de Charles Aznavour y Leonardo Favio, a los viejos dioses de siempre.\nEn 1987, Cristina y Carlos Mario se casaron por primera vez. Los casó un sacerdote muy especial. Se llamaba Carlos Alberto Calderón, quien murió de paludismo algunos años después mientras hacía un trabajo humanitario en África. El padre Calderón aceptó casarlos a sabiendas de que era una pareja sinigual y no se parecían a nadie y menos a las parejas normales de Medellín. Ella no quería tener hijos, a él le daba pereza tener que sacar tiempo para criar una persona. Estaba fundido con los libros. El Padre dejó incluso que en la iglesia pusieran los tangos sicotrópicos de Astor Piazzolla. Se casaron y, tal y como lo reconoció Aguirre, volvió a nacer.\nDe la vida del teatro al teatro de la vida\nCristina ingresó al solitario grupo en 1985 cuando pasaron de tener 7 espectadores a 25 y con el lanzamiento de Boleros en su ruta, lograron llenar otra sala para 50 personas. El estreno de País Paisa en 1986 les cambió la vida y en 1988 el teatro se convirtió en negocio.\nLa idea fue de Cristina Toro que Carlos Mario dejara un poco a los autores malditos para darle cabida al humor y fue un éxito. País Paisa, la obra que resume en clave de comedia la esencia de la antioqueñidad, se ha presentado de manera ininterrumpida desde 1986 en más de cincuenta países del mundo.\nDesde entonces, han vendido millones de DVDs e incluso la cantidad de gente que compra en línea la obra a través de Boletaenmano.com se cuentan por millares. A este éxito se sumaron otros estruendosos como No vuelvo a beber, La puntica no más, Lo que no mata, engorda.\nEn 1988, compraron una emblemática casa del barrio Prado en Medellín construida en 1916, conocida como el Palacio Medina, referente arquitectónico de la ciudad porque allí se grabó Bajo el cielo antioqueño en 1925, una de las pocas películas mudas colombianas conservada íntegramente y dicen que también fue velado el expresidente Carlos E. Restrepo.\nCristina dice, con orgullo, que País Paisa es la primera obra de teatro vista hasta por los futbolistas más famosos de este país. En 1989 ya eran tan famosos que\nHernán Darío Bolillo Gómez, su amigo de infancia, lo llevó con la Selección Colombia a Tel Aviv donde jugaría el partido decisivo contra Israel cuando buscaba regresar a un mundial de fútbol después de 28 años de ausencia. El equipo los tomó como si fueran un amuleto. Incluso, Francisco Pacho Maturana le dio la oportunidad a Cristina de que diera la charla técnica antes del partido. Funcionó, Colombia clasificó.\nEn la inmensa casa de la Calle 59 y con bienestar económico, Aguirre guardó allí su mayor tesoro, una biblioteca enorme con algunos libros invaluables y por esta colección, fue distinguido como uno de los poseedores de libros más importantes de Latinoamérica en 2022.\nHace unos meses, Cristina y Carlos Mario, compraron otra casa igual de grande, contigua al Palacio y las unieron para hacer una sede monumental llamada Solar del Águila Descalza en un espacio de 1.400 metros cuadrados y es una de las obras con las que el emblemático barrio El Prado de Medellín se está volviendo a levantar. En esa casa proyectan un teatro para presentar sus stand up comedy y un restaurante con capacidad para 200 personas.\nAhora, la ciudad de Medellín está llena de pasacalles con la foto de Carlos Mario y Cristina promocionando Luna de mier… Si, para un lector de Anton Chejov, títulos procaces como convirtió al Águila Descalza en el grupo teatral que mejor le va en el país, al menos desde el punto de vista económico.\nCarlos Mario es el primero en reconocer que le debe todo a Cristina. Incluso, su desintoxicación en 2004 y desde entonces ve el mundo tal y cómo es. Igual sigue siendo un tipo particular, con su pelo, sus pintas y su necesidad de estar solo, solo con Cristina con quien ha vuelto y regresado como quien se exilia y vuelve de una patria amada porque pase lo que pase, siempre van a estar juntos. A veces así habla el amor.",
