    "text": "Andalucía aspira a desempeñar un papel protagonista en el desarrollo de la industria verde\nEl consejero de Industria, Energía y Minas de la Junta de Andalucía, Jorge Paradela, ha participado en un desayuno informativo organizado por Executive Forum, con la colaboración de Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure. Durante el encuentro, Paradela ha compartido la apuesta del gobierno andaluz \"por una política industrial ambiciosa y útil\" en el marco de la transición energética y digital.\nDurante su intervención, Paradela ha presentado algunas de las medidas que están llevando a cabo “para continuar impulsando el desarrollo económico y social en Andalucía”. Entre ellas, ha destacado la aprobación del Plan CRECE Industria 2027 esta misma semana, declarando que se trata de “un paso más en el camino emprendido para impulsar el desarrollo industrial de Andalucía”. Este plan contará con una dotación presupuestaria de 1.800 millones de euros, a través de los cuales se pretende movilizar 25.000 millones de inversión industrial en 2027, que conllevarán la creación de 64.500 empleos.\nEn este sentido, el consejero ha subrayado que “el Gobierno andaluz quiere aprovechar las nuevas oportunidades industriales que conlleva la transición energética y digital con el impulso a una política industrial ambiciosa y útil” y ha destacado que \"Andalucía aspira a desempeñar un papel protagonista en el desarrollo de esta nueva industria verde”. En los últimos cinco años, la región ha duplicado la potencia eléctrica verde instalada hasta casi alcanzar los 12 GW y hay otros 11 GW que ya cuentan con autorización de construcción.\nEn esta línea, el consejero ha afirmado que el Ejecutivo andaluz \"está apostando fuerte\" también por las nuevas tecnologías y vectores energéticos, entre los que ha destacado el hidrógeno renovable y sus moléculas derivadas, los biocombustibles y el biogás. Así, ha anunciado que la Consejería de Industria, Energía y Minas está trabajando en la constitución de una alianza andaluza que aglutine a todos los agentes implicados, similar a la que impulsó en el sector del hidrógeno verde, y que en su primer año de andadura ha establecido una hoja de ruta para el sector y un mapa que identifica las capacidades de la cadena de valor en esta comunidad autónoma.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "近年来，去泰国试管婴儿的家庭越来越多，现在有很多的赴泰国试管婴儿的家庭都会选择寻找一家正规的泰国试管婴儿机构去泰国做试管婴儿，目的是为了更加省心、省力、安心做试管，但是在这过程中，有很多的家庭对泰国试管机构不是很了解，使得很多的家庭掉入陷阱，那么去泰国做试管婴儿的机构要警惕那些陷阱呢？现在就来为大家详细讲解。\n去泰国做试管婴儿的机构要警惕这些陷阱\n1、价格问题\n去泰国做试管，有些朋友可能对泰国试管婴儿的费用不是很多了解，有很多的患者贪图便宜选择价格超低的去，或者自己自助去泰国试管婴儿，以为这样就可以节省更多的费用，而对于出国做试管可不能凑合马虎，每一项工作的进行都需要考虑周全，但各位有没有想过，他们的价格为什么会这么便宜？对于这些陷阱，大家一定要重视。\n2、沟通问题\n在泰国做试管婴儿大家较为关心的就是语言沟通问题，有些姐妹觉得专业医疗翻译费比较贵，然后就去找了3-4千块钱的兼职翻译、临时翻译，目前，在泰国做医疗翻译的大概有三种：一是留学生兼职的；二是临时转行的；三是专业的医疗翻译，翻译在泰国试管中占据的位置是非常重要的，贯穿着整个试管周期，如果找了不专业的翻译把药剂翻译错了，还有的是直接联系不上人，对于这样陷阱，大家也一定要重视。\n3、居住问题\n有的患者为了节省费用找了一些的，而这些便宜的一般安排的住宿地方基本都是在郊区，房价便宜，通常这种房子一个月的租金还不及医院附近四星级酒店的一个零头，对于这样的，大家也一定要注意了，我们每天要到医院酒店来回，如果住得较远，万一堵车等问题，耽搁了治疗时间可是大事。\n4、就餐问题\n在试管期间，试管妈妈的营养是非常重要的，可便宜的为了节省开支，通常会打着保姆阿姨现做的幌子，然后跑到路边或者去那种大食堂买，卫不卫生、好不好吃先不说，但肯定没营养，也吃不惯，要知道，曼谷会点中文能和客人沟通又会做饭的保姆的价格并不便宜，基本和国内北上广没太大区别。\n13年的服务机构去泰国做试管婴儿花这么多钱不容易，我们都懂得，但是在选择机构的时候，千万要全面考虑，不要一味地只看中低价，贪小便宜，千万不要被坑了，所以，去泰国做试管婴儿的机构要警惕这些陷阱，而恒建专注于提供海外生殖医疗咨询，关于收费无隐性收费等等。",

    "text": "“Friendship seems as necessary an element of a comfortable existence in this world as fire or water, or even air itself,” Charles Spurgeon wrote. “A man may drag along a miserable existence in proud solitary dignity, but his life is scarce life, it is nothing but an existence, the tree of life being stripped of the leaves of hope and the fruits of joy. He who would be happy here must have friends; and he who would be happy hereafter, must, above all things, find a friend in the world to come, in the person of God, the Father of his people.” In the camaraderie of brothers and sisters I served alongside after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, I learned the importance of not living in isolation. This lesson was reiterated recently as I have walked with family and friends through the [trauma of the accident](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/mountain-tragedy-draws-two-distant-churches-together/) in Phoenix that resulted in the loss of life of one and severely injured three others from Ten Mile Baptist Church. It is dangerous and unwise to live life disconnected from others. Solomon warned, “One who isolates himself pursues selfish desires; he rebels against all sound wisdom” (Proverbs 18:1) God spoke in Genesis 2:16, “It is not good for the man to be alone.” This is the only item in the creation account called “not good.” Adam had perfect fellowship with God in the Garden, but the Lord saw fit that man needed the companionship of others. Friendship is perfectly demonstrated in the Trinity by the relationship between God the Father, God the Son and God the Spirit. As image bearers, we have an innate desire for fellowship, as it reflects our Creator. In Scripture, we see a variety of friendships: Jesus with Peter, James and John the Beloved; David and Jonathan who exhibited brotherly love to one another; Paul and Timothy in a mentoring kind of friendship; in-laws Naomi and Ruth. Common to them all is affirmation. It’s an important part of relationships, and of the culture of ministry. In his book, “Made for Friendship,” pastor Drew Hunter offers practical steps regarding affirmation. Guys are especially good at giving a jab in the side with a sarcastic comment, but we don’t always know how that may actually be tearing the other person down. As a counselor, I often hear clients say, “I’ve heard those things all my life, and now I believe them.” But Scripture says, “Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor” (Romans 12:10 ESV). Hunter wrote, “Whenever the thought crosses your mind to affirm something about someone, do it, and do it without hesitation.” Maybe it doesn’t feel normal to look your friend in the eye and say you admire him or her. For guys that can be particularly hard when sarcasm has been the most common form of expression. Most guys who come to my office were taught as boys to suppress their emotions. Because of this, emotions and affirmation can be uncomfortable. That discomfort often is expressed in the form of sarcasm. They do not know how to handle or express true affection. David slayed Goliath as well as the lion and the bear, but he also played the harp and wrote poetry in the form of psalms. If we read a few psalms, we will hear the depth of emotion expressed in the words of David. With practice, kind words and affirmation will begin to feel normal. “If you desire true friendship, it is not because you are weak; it is because you’re not a rock,” Hunter wrote. “You are made in the image of the God of exuberant love. You are most like God, and you are most truly human when you want friendship. Your unmet longings for friendship are not evidence of a deficiency; they are signs of your dignity. God made you for friendship.” Those in ministry especially need friends who will love them because of who they are, not just because they are a leader in their church. This kind of culture change starts from the top. If we are the example of a good, faithful friend, we are more likely to find good, faithful friends. A good friend handed me a copy of Made for Friendship a year ago and asked me to put its principles into practice. I’m working on it. And I’m discovering in biblical friendship, we find encouragement and the strength to persevere. Jared Pryer is a counselor in Mt. Vernon, Illinois and teaches adults and youth at Ten Mile Baptist Church in McLeansboro.",

    "text": "Tucano é flagrado se 'exibindo' para câmera na Rodovia Anhanguera, em Americana Uma câmera de monitoramento de tráfego flagrou, às 10h15 desta quinta-feira (19), um tucano no km 120 da Rodovia Anhanguera (SP-330), em Americana (SP) . Nas imagens registradas, é possível observar a ave pousando em frente ao equipamento da concessionária, e “se exibindo” para a câmera (veja no vídeo acima). Segundo a concessionária AutoBAn, que administra a via, o animal é um tucano-toco — também conhecido como tucano-grande, tucano-boi ou tucanaçu — e é o maior entre todos da sua espécie. Tucano-boi é flagrando por câmeras da concessionária AutoBAn, no km 120 da Rodovia Anhanguera, em Americana (SP) — Foto: Reprodução/AutoBAn",
