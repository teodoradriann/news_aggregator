    "text": "Meet the People Who Work Fully Remote—and Hate It\nMost employees still want to be able to work from home at least some of the time. But a small cohort yearns to get back to cubicles and chit-chat.\nTravis Woo is living the dream, working remotely from the Hawaiian island of Oahu. On a recent Tuesday, the 35-year-old entrepreneur posted a YouTube video of himself walking his dog on an idyllic beach beneath a cerulean blue sky, white-tipped waves crashing on the shore behind him.\nIt’s an envy-inducing scene, until you listen to what he’s saying. “Working remote, it allowed me to move to Hawaii,” the Seattle native acknowledges, but “there’s a lot of social negatives…One of the costs is loneliness.” Being on a computer screen all day, Woo says, feels like “being a captive animal in the zoo. You know, like a captive human.”\nFive years after the pandemic shutdown, we’re in the midst of a major back-to-the-office push. Companies from AT&T to Chipotle are cracking down on remote work, as is the Trump administration, which has threatened to fire federal employees who don’t show up five days a week.\nEmployees, for the most part, are furious, fighting back with petitions and lawsuits. More than 90% of Amazon professionals in a recent survey objected to the company’s demand for five days a week on premises. A recent Pew survey found that almost half of employees say they’d likely look for a new job if their employer eliminated remote options.\nBut lost in the crowd is a small, sad cohort that just wants their cubicles back. Most are stranded at home either because their physical office no longer exists or their position in the org chart has been designated remote. Reddit is filled with threads from this lonely crowd, with topics like “Working from home has ruined me,” “I absolutely hate working from home” and “I hate remote work, am I insane?” A U.K.-based executive’s LinkedIn rant, “I HATE WORKING FROM HOME! There, I said it,” went viral, racking up thousands of comments.\nJust 3% of white collar employees want to return to the office five days a week, an Advanced Workplace Associates poll found. “I know I’m the weird one,” laughs engineer Damien Peters, 41, of Silver Spring, Md., the managing partner of a fully remote consulting firm. He gets too easily distracted by “chores I can attend to, taxes I can do,” and misses the camaraderie with colleagues. “I’m quite introverted and a bit antisocial, but I don’t like not seeing anyone,” he says. He realizes that he is an outlier, even in his own home: “My wife is fully remote, and she loves it passionately.”\nPaige Shaw, 47, an Orlando insurance professional who went remote during the pandemic, hated it so much that she quit her job. She’s now in an on-premises role, where she relishes everything about office life—the colleagues to chitchat with, the free food for celebrations, the corridors she can roam when she needs a break. She even likes the commute, which she uses to plan her day in the mornings and to unwind in the evenings, taking “the scenic route” on local roads. “My industry is stressful, and you need to compartmentalize,” she says.\nSome unhappy remote workers complain that the isolation crushes their social skills. Travis Woo says weekends with friends are awkward when “you’re not socially warmed up” from the week. Ellyn Rose, 58, a remote senior project control engineer in Kirkland, Wash., tries to see friends on weekday evenings, but those with on-premises jobs just want to chill out at home. “I feel like my dog when I used to come home: ‘Can we play, can we play?’ But they already had their social fix for their day.”\nIn pre-pandemic days, getting an occasional day to work at home was seen as a gift, a glorious break from the daily grind. “I loved my Fridays working at home. It was a treat,” says Amy Aronoff Blumkin, a senior marketing executive. She enjoyed doing early-morning workouts instead of commuting to New York from her New Jersey home.\nBut now, working remotely for a Washington, D.C., nonprofit, the novelty has worn thin. “I miss the creativity, I miss the popping into someone’s office to say, ‘I have a question’ rather than setting up a Zoom call,” says Blumkin, chief growth officer for the National Council of Jewish Women. It’s more difficult to forge relationships, to act quickly and to mentor younger employees. She looks forward to her periodic visits to headquarters, with its bustling energy. “Most of my closest friends have been people who I met at work, the people who get me through and who were at my wedding,” she says. “You don’t have that now.”\nLonely remote employees try all sorts of hacks to re-create office vibes. New York City journalist Nelson Wang, 54, who spent the majority of his 30-year career working in a newsroom, has become an expert at sussing out a rotating set of locales, among them his apartment building’s common room, neighborhood coffee shops and the office of a publication where he freelances.\nBut even when remote workers show up in person, there’s no guarantee anyone will be there. IT professional Ryan Daniels tried going into his office even though his position is classified as remote. “It was worse than being at home,” he says. “It was a ghost town. I thought if something happened to me here, it would take a couple of days for people to find me.” He then rented a co-working space on his own dime, “but there are rarely any people in there” either.\nThose who are itching to go back to the office don’t get a lot of sympathy. When a remote worker wrote on a Reddit post that “my depression has steadily increased,” one commenter chided him for “wasting a spot” for someone more deserving. When another remote worker confessed, “I now dread logging in, I feel so isolated, the days feel draining and I’m just unhappy,” an irate commenter shot back: “Everyone I know that was forced back to an office hates their lives right now. Someone complaining about work from home is unbelievable.”\nStill, even those pining for the office don’t necessarily wish for five days a week chained to their desks. Many would prefer a hybrid schedule, which more than half of Americans with remote-capable jobs already enjoy, Gallup found. Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom has found that hybrid work is equally productive and makes employees happier, with quit rates declining by 35%. Even Shaw, the Orlando insurance professional who loves the office, still works one day a week at home: “It’s more efficient for me, and it’s more efficient for my employer.”\nOahu’s Woo, for his part, has given up the fully remote life. He first moved to the island in 2017 while working remotely in the videogame industry, but a year ago, he says, “I found myself not missing the office but missing socializing during the day.” He pivoted into running a few small online businesses and now works part time at a marine tourism company, ferrying visitors to look at dolphins and whales. “It’s not an office setting,” he concedes, but at least “I have a bunch of co-workers now.”\nJoanne Lipman is the former chief content officer of Gannett and editor in chief of USA Today.

    "text": "監視中國軍機軍艦 日本擬在南鳥島部署警戒雷達\n2025/6/12 14:36\n（中央社記者戴雅真東京12日專電）為防範外國軍機侵犯或接近日本領空，日本防衛省正在研究於南鳥島部署移動式警戒管制雷達系統。隨著中國航空母艦首次越過第二島鏈，日本也在強化警戒與監視態勢。另一方面，防衛省尚無在太平洋島嶼部屬戰鬥機部隊，或設置防空識別區（ADIZ）的計畫。\n產經新聞報導，在2022年12月制定的防衛力整備計畫中，明確提出要在太平洋離島等地區部署移動式雷達。目前在太平洋地區，除了硫磺島之外，小笠原諸島和伊豆諸島都沒有部署雷達，防空稍顯薄弱。\n隸屬東京都的南鳥島目前雖然有海上自衛隊常駐，但是沒有民間人士。防衛省內部認為，島上適合設置雷達系統。此外，也計劃在南鳥島上建設陸上自衛隊的12式陸基反艦飛彈射擊場，用於從陸地上瞄準敵方軍艦。\n為了掌握進出太平洋的中國軍機，防衛省也將在沖繩縣的北大東島部署移動式雷達。\n中國航空母艦「遼寧號」7日曾與飛彈驅逐艦等軍艦編隊，在距離南鳥島西南約300公里的日本專屬經濟區（EEZ）內航行，另一艘航空母艦「山東號」也進入了太平洋並進行實戰訓練。這是中國首次有2艘航空母艦同時在太平洋活動。對此，日本自衛隊高層憂心，「今後的活動範圍很可能進一步擴大」。\n日本雖然一直設想「台灣有事」來加強西南方面的防衛力，但對太平洋方面的防衛則相對落後。過去太平洋戰爭時期，美軍曾從航空母艦上出動轟炸機空襲東京等地，造成巨大損失。如果日本在太平洋的防空滯後，中國軍機很可能透過侵犯領空等手段來增加威懾力。（編輯：田瑞華）1140612\n本網站之文字、圖片及影音，非經授權，不得轉載、公開播送或公開傳輸及利用。",

    "text": "BANKS COUNTY, Ga. — In the Banks County High School auditorium, about two dozen students showed up to the first day of forensic science class on Friday morning. For Senior Emma Williams, she was \"so excited.\" \"I was like, 'all my podcasts—I’m going to finally be that girl,\" Williams said with a smile when she learned a medical examiner with the [Georgia Bureau of Investigation](https://gbi.georgia.gov/) would be leading the first class. Williams said while science or math isn't her strength, it's a class she worked to get into. \"And I’m really interested in this,\" Williams described. \"There are only two girls in my forensic science class. I think it's really important that I do want to pursue this.\" Dr. Rachel Geller, an associate medical examiner with the GBI, spoke with the students as she explained what a medical examiner is, what they do, and why they're so needed. \"I think the most important thing we can do to address the critical shortage of forensic pathologists in the United States is support younger people and mentor the youth,\" Geller said. \"We have such small numbers of people going into this field and completing all of the training, and yet, we have so many positions unfilled, and we really need forensic pathologists to serve the community,\" she added. Across the country, Geller said only about 50 forensic pathologists graduated in 2023, adding it's the main reason for the nationwide shortage. It's one reason the GBI decided to recruit more people by going into high schools in hopes of encouraging more students to pursue a career in forensic science. \"I see 20 forensic pathologists,\" Geller laughed when talking about the class. \"I was delighted to see all of these young people who are excited about forensic science because we have so many openings at the GBI.\" Currently, the GBI needs toxicologists, fingerprint examiners, forensic scientists, and more. Geller said the need not only impacts the backlog but also the families that are waiting for closure. The ability to bring families some peace is what Geller called \"the greatest privilege\" of being a medical examiner. She added another privilege, was getting to speak with and encourage students like Williams. \"All of them that came up were women,\" said Williams of the three GBI doctors in attendance. \"That was really exciting, and that was really encouraging. 'Okay, I can do this, and I can be someone important in this field.'\" Geller said she knows it's a long road for the students that want to become medical examiners, with years of school needed. But she said the journey is worth it.",

    "title": "Chances for tropical depression off Florida coast up to 90%, hurricane center says – Orlando Sentinel",
    "text": "The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for parts of Florida as it began advisories Friday on what it’s now calling Potential Tropical Cyclone Four.As of 5 p.m., the center of the broad system that has been forming from a vast tropical wave is located about 25 miles west of Camaguey, Cuba and 315 miles southeast of Key West with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph as it moves west-northwest at 16 mph.\nA tropical storm warning is now in effect for the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula from East Cape Sable north to Boca Grande and a tropical storm watch in effect for the Florida Keys south of the Card Sound Bridge that connects Miami-Dade to Key Largo down to Key West including the Dry Tortugas, as well as the southern coast of the Florida peninsula east of East Cape Sable to the Card Sound bridge, and for the west coast of the Florida peninsula north of Boca Grande to the mouth of the Suwannee River.\nA storm surge watch has been issued for the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Bonita Beach north to the mouth of the Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.\nHow tropical system could impact Florida this weekend\n“A turn toward the northwest at a slower forward speed is expected tonight or Saturday, followed by a turn toward the north on Sunday,” NHC senior hurricane specialist Jack Beven said. “On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move over Cuba tonight, cross the Straits of Florida into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday, and then move near or over the west coast of Florida Saturday night through Sunday night.”\nThe NHC still gives the system a 80% chance of development in the next two days and 90% chance in the next seven.\nThe intensity is expected to increase into a tropical depression by Saturday and then into what could become Tropical Storm Debby by Saturday night after it moves across the Straits of Florida into the Gulf of Mexico. The forecast cone has it making landfall north of Tampa on Sunday night or early Monday with winds shy of hurricane strength, but still 65 mph sustained winds and gusts of 75 mph.\n11am EDT August 2nd: Here are the initial key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Four ( #PTC4 ).\nTropical Storm Watches and Warnings have been issued for the Florida Keys and portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula. https://t.co/it6IRLenVu pic.twitter.com/zkvTeNe2MH\n— National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) August 2, 2024\n“Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area late Saturday and Saturday night,” Beven said. “Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys and the southern Florida peninsula by Saturday or Saturday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area along the Florida west coast Saturday night or Sunday.”\nIn addition, storm surge is forecast to be as high as 3 feet from Aripeka to the Card Sound Bridge, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, depending on high tide.\nThe NHC expects rainfall from 4 to 8 inches with some areas getting up to 12 inches across portions of Florida and the Southeast U.S. this weekend and through Wednesday morning that could cause flash and urban flooding as well as some isolated river flooding.\nFor now, the system is a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms across Hispaniola, the southeastern Bahamas and eastern Cuba as well as the adjacent waters of the southwestern Atlantic.\nThe NHC’s official path is fed by several weather models that have the path steering it up Florida’s west coast and moving inland.\nWeather forecast tracks as of Friday afternoon for Invest 97L that is forecast to become a tropical depression and possibly Tropical Storm Debby. (OrlandoSentinel.com/hurricane) Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared most Florida counties under a state of emergency around 5 p.m. Wednesday. Floods could ensue if the system continued its current slow course or even stalled over the Florida peninsula.\nThe Florida Department of Emergency Management has activated the State Emergency Operations Center while the Florida National Guard has around 3,000 service members readying for response efforts, the governor’s office stated in an email.\nIn addition, 70 members of the Florida State Guard along with nine shallow water vessels, 10 UTVs and two amphibious rescue vehicles have been staged for deployment. Seven search and rescue crews are prepared to deploy from Camp Blanding. Also, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has readied high-water vehicles and all other storm response resources statewide.\n“Regardless of development, heavy rains could cause areas of flash flooding across Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas through the weekend, and interests in these locations should continue to monitor the progress of this system,” Beven said. “A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system later today, if necessary.”\nThis infrared radar image shows rainfall from Potential Tropical Cyclone Four approaching the Florida Straits on Friday, Aug. 2, 2024. (NOAA/GOES-East) The tropical wave stretches over hundreds of miles from the Caribbean Sea all the way north to the central Bahamas in the Atlantic. It’s moving west around 20 mph and the northern end has seen wave heights up to 7 feet on Friday.\nFor Central Florida, the National Weather Service in Melbourne forecasts 2-4 inches of rain in some areas with 4-6 inches north of Interstate 4 over the weekend.\nTropical-storm-force winds and possible tornadoes are possible on Sunday into the overnight as the system moves through the region.\nBoscile Davis, 70, fills up sandbags at Sanford Public Works on Friday, August 2, 2024. Davis, who lives in the Bookertown neighborhood of Sanford, is taking precautions a as a tropical storm warning was issued for parts of Florida. (Rich Pope, Orlando Sentinel) Several locations around Orange, Lake, Seminole and Volusia counties began providing sandbag supplies. The region suffered serious flooding during Hurricane Ian in 2022.\nFarther south, according to NWS Miami, some areas over the weekend could see up from 4-8 inches of rain starting Saturday. Some areas could top 12 inches and a flood watch is in effect for South Florida.\n“Regardless of development, this will bring a surge of deep tropical moisture to the region which will result in the potential for excessive rainfall and localized flooding throughout the day on Saturday,” said NWS Miami Meteorologist Chuck Caracozza. “What still remains highly uncertain is the details of exactly where the heaviest rainfall will occur.”\nThe tropical action is the first tracked by the NHC since Hurricane Beryl moved through the Caribbean, Mexico and Texas in late June and early July.\nThree weeks of dry Saharan dust moving west off the African continent into the Atlantic has stymied development over the ocean, although water temperatures remain above normal.\nSo far the season has seen three named storms. It’s not forecast to intensify, but if this system got strong enough, it could become Tropical Storm Debby.\nHurricane season runs from June 1-Nov. 30, but the height of storm formation runs from mid-August into October.\nOriginally Published: August 2, 2024 at 8:13 a.m. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Tropical storm warning issued for parts of Florida as system approaches Tropical storm warning issued for parts of Florida as system approaches Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says How tropical system could impact Florida this weekend How tropical system could impact Florida this weekend FDA discovery might make you think twice about getting that tattoo FDA discovery might make you think twice about getting that tattoo Tropical storm likely to skirt Florida’s Gulf Coast but soak Orlando area Tropical storm likely to skirt Florida's Gulf Coast but soak Orlando area 10 Central Florida restaurants shut down last week amid health inspections 10 Central Florida restaurants shut down last week amid health inspections Former ballerina in Florida is convicted of manslaughter in her estranged husband’s 2020 shooting Former ballerina in Florida is convicted of manslaughter in her estranged husband’s 2020 shooting Florida homeowners become Slide customers — whether they want to or not | Commentary Florida homeowners become Slide customers — whether they want to or not | Commentary Norma Padgett, who falsely accused the Groveland Four of rape, dies at 92 Norma Padgett, who falsely accused the Groveland Four of rape, dies at 92 ‘An atrocious wrongdoing’: Seminole neighborhood floods regularly after homeowner plugs its only drainpipe 'An atrocious wrongdoing': Seminole neighborhood floods regularly after homeowner plugs its only drainpipe Trending Nationally Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says How to buy Disneyland lost and found items at ridiculously cheap prices Trump posts photo of Kamala Harris wearing Indian attire in new ‘she became Black’ smear COVID spreading quickly in San Diego County Gov.
