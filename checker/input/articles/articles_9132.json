    "title": "India's far-right cow vigilantes bolster clout before high-stake elections",
    "text": "By Rupam Jain CHAMDHERA, India (Reuters) – Vishnu Dabad attributes his rise from poverty to powerful local politician to an animal: the cow. The 30-year-old is one of many Gau Rakshaks, or cow protectors: activists who have taken Indian laws banning cattle slaughter and beef consumption into their own hands since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 at the head of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Scores of cow protectors in recent years have been accused of using violence to carry out extra-judicial activities, often finding themselves at odds with law enforcement, even as many won acclaim for defending the Hindu faith. Now some of these operatives are transferring their clout into grassroots political power, where they are pursuing a hardline majoritarian agenda, according to interviews with more than 90 activist-vigilantes, as well as senior leaders of the BJP and other parties, government officials and political analysts. They described how cow vigilantism has become a finishing school for the young men who mobilise large groups against alleged cattle smugglers and used the resulting popularity to catapult into politics. Many are now campaigning and preparing for elections in 2024 that the BJP and allied right-wing parties are favoured to do well in. Forty-one of the cow protectors who spoke to Reuters have been elected to positions such as village chief, town council member or local legislator in the past six years, roles that can involve governing tens of thousands of people. Another 12 said they were lobbying their family members to seek local office. “All of what you see: my success, my existence is only because cows have blessed me,” said Dabad, who started a cow protection force in 2014 and was elected as village chief in 2016. He is now a full-time political campaigner in the northern state of Haryana for a party allied with the BJP, and is keen to seek higher office. Ancient Hindu religious texts praise cows, who are regarded as deities, for their nurturing ability. But India’s minority Muslims and Christians, as well as some Hindus, consume beef as part of their diet, generating some sectarian tensions. There is no publicly available official estimate on the number of cow activists nationwide, but activist leaders said they believe more than 300,000 Hindu men in the nation of 1.4 billion are directly involved with their groups. India’s interior ministry, which oversees national law enforcement, did not return a request for comment on that figure or the role of cow activists. Reuters previously reported that some of them have stopped cow traders – many of them Muslim men – with deadly force, according to prosecutors, witnesses and the families of victims. Some states have enacted laws enabling cow vigilantes to patrol alongside police. While government data does not distinguish general violence from cow-related lynching, Human Rights Watch found that at least 44 people – 36 of them Muslims – were killed in cow-related violence between May 2015 and December 2018. The independent, New Delhi-based Documentation of the Oppressed database found 206 acts of cow-related violence involving 850 victims, mainly Muslims, between July 2014 and August 2022. The proximity of cow activists to power has raised concerns among many Muslims, who allege that some BJP members and their affiliates have engaged in anti-Islam hate speech and violence. Modi and the BJP have denied that religious discrimination exists in India. Cow protectors “are very powerful men…and there is a climate of fear,” said Jaan Mohammed, a Muslim man whose brother was one of the first victims of a cow-related lynching after Modi took power. “I don’t think this can ever change now.” Legal proceedings are pending. Seventeen men accused of involvement in his brother’s 2015 killing were released on bail, and another suspect later died. Police at the time of the slaying said the alleged perpetrators behaved as if they had a “licence to kill.” Modi has repeatedly criticized activists who engage in “criminal” violence, even as his party courts their support. Giriraj Singh, a BJP minister responsible for rural development, said his party welcomed anyone who wanted to “genuinely serve the cows”. “Anyone who saves mother cow must be respected and recognised,” he told Reuters. IMAGE OF MODERN-DAY HINDU WARRIORS Half of India’s 36 states and union territories have partial or complete bans on cow slaughter – most of them governed by the BJP. But enforcement has often fallen into the hands of activists. By posting videos of their raids on alleged cow smugglers on social media, they have mobilised money, as well as thousands of Hindu men. Religious cow protection movements have a long history in India, but many activists, including Dabad, said they were emboldened by Modi’s sweeping 2014 victory. Dabad recounted bloody fights between his activists – who he said are often armed with batons, stones, machetes, and sickles – and alleged Muslim smugglers. He described spreading beds of nails on the road to stop vehicles suspected of smuggling cows, as well as high-speed chases and brutal attacks. “The journey to protect cows has not been easy,” said Dabad, who previously spent more than a month in jail for his vigilante activities. Police responsible for the area around his hometown of Chamdhera said Dabad has been the subject of nine criminal complaints related to religious clashes and that he was arrested once for allegedly beating up a Muslim trader. Investigations continue on one complaint, while the other probes have been dismissed, they said. The image of lawlessness has not stopped politicians from seeking the support of such activists. Six officials from the party of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who identified himself as Dabad’s political patron, said the activist was an effective campaigner and a rising star. Influential right-wing organisations such as the ruling party-affiliated World Hindu Council have helped legitimise the activists by depicting them as modern-day warriors waging a war against cow slaughter. Council spokesman Vinod Bansal likened cow protectors, some of whom he said had been killed in clashes, to brave religious warriors. He added that achieving political fame was only a side-effect of the efforts of some activists. Christophe Jaffrelot, a professor of Indian politics at King’s College London, said the Indian state cannot harass minorities openly but by allowing vigilantes to do so, it keeps majoritarian feelings satisfied. “And now these private armies … are being given a share in governance and power at the local level,” he said, adding that they would continue their penetration of politics. During an interview in his guesthouse, as his aides smoked on a brass water pipe, Dabad looked at them and said: “We can all kill or get killed to protect the cow.” FORCE OF THEIR OWN Of the 41 vigilante-politicians, eight said they joined the BJP at its encouragement. Another eight, including Dabad, joined other regional parties because they said they had doubts about the BJP’s commitment to cows and Hindu values. “If police would effectively identify and apprehend the alleged violators of cow protection laws, then not a single Gau Rakshak will be needed,” said Ram Charan Pande, a cow vigilante leader who serves as a village head in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Narendra Raghuvanshi, a member of a regional nationalist party and a Gau Rakshak based in the central state of Madhya Pradesh said that politicians often approached cow protectors for their support: “They know we can tilt the Hindu vote in their favour”. Some of the activists-turned-politicians have created power bases of their own. Dabad, the son of an illiterate farmer, now zips around Haryana in a convoy of four SUVs, while running a centre for injured and ill cows. He said his political clout help him secure licences and offices for business ventures such as an alcohol store, an eatery and a real estate company. “I have been able to set all of these businesses because now people know me as a man committed to protect cows,” he said. That has caused unease within India’s opposition parties and the country’s security establishment, according to interviews with three officials and one lawmaker. A top Indian interior ministry official who was interviewed on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with media, said the cow vigilantes have managed to blend popularity with nous on local issues. “Even politicians feel threatened by the enormous network of cow vigilantes,” he said. “They have become a force of their own.” (Reporting by Rupam Jain; Additonal reporting by Shivam Patel in New Delhi; Editing by Katerina Ang)",

Virtual-recruitment landscape in Southeast AsiaA new wave of behavioral assessments is rippling through SEA, using natural language processing (NLP) and psycholinguistic analytics to analyse candidates’ responses and provide insights about their unique personality profiles through live and asynchronous video interviews. So, what should companies in SEA know before jumping on the behavioral assessments bandwagon? Sanjoe Tom Jose, CEO and Founder of Talview shared his thoughts. Bridging the talent shortage in modern data centresWith Singapore ranking second amongst the most desirable data centre locations globally, and first in Asia, according to a study by Cushman & Wakefield, the need to address the shortage of data centre talent is more urgent than ever. Here are three key ways to effectively bridge the data centre talent gap. Take what Lee Siew Keong, Head of Secure Power Division (Singapore), Schneider Electric shared. 3 compelling reasons why SEA businesses are embracing multilingualismIt’s no secret that English is the world’s lingua franca of business. And, as global markets expand, economies in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam are due to grow by 4.2% this year and 4.8% next year.

    "title": "Rosiak: From childhood fan to colleague, how lucky I was to have gotten to know Bob Uecker",
    "text": "Rosiak: From childhood fan to colleague, how lucky I was to have gotten to know Bob Uecker\nHaving been born, raised and lived my entire life in the Milwaukee area, I fully realize how cool it is to cover the hometown Milwaukee Brewers for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe 2025 season will be my 15th on the beat, but my history with the team goes back much longer, and is much deeper.\nI spent a good portion of my youth at County Stadium watching games on Brewers Pepsi Fan Club tickets and prowling out front of the ballpark asking players for autographs. I still have the baseball Marshall Edwards flipped to me in the stands in 1983. Both he and Charlie Moore signed it, and my hands shook for days after. Mimicking the batting stances of Cecil Cooper and Ben Oglivie, even though none of us kids in the subdivision hit left-handed, were musts whenever we hit the sandlots.\nI’ll never forget our teachers rolling in the big TV on the stand so we sixth-graders could watch the Brewers play for an hour in the 1982 playoffs. What a treat that was, being allowed to stay up late on a school night to watch the World Series that year, as heartbreaking as it turned out to be for a kid.\nI'm not ashamed to admit I shed some tears in the stands on Sept. 28, 2000 when we all said goodbye to County Stadium for the last time.\nThe broadcasts on 620 WTMJ were the soundtrack to my youth. I can still hear the transistor radio crackling in the garage as my father worked on his assorted projects, or tuning the dial to the game while driving to or from grandma’s house in Bay View with the family. That's how I heard the miraculous ninth-inning comeback by \"Team Streak\" on Easter Sunday, 1987.\nHeck, I used to record games on cassette tapes to listen to in the winter, whenever I began missing baseball too much (I still have those, too, by the way).\nI'm guessing many of you out there can say many of the same things.\nThe constant in so many of those memories, those moments, of course, was Bob Uecker, who died early Thursday at age 90.\nHis \"The Tonight Show\" appearances were stuff of legend, as were his Miller Lite commercials. I read \"Catcher in the Wry\" multiple times. I couldn’t wait to watch \"Mr. Belvedere\" every Friday night on Channel 12. His turn as Harry Doyle in the movie \"Major League\" was legendary (and yes, I was in the crowd for the filming of that as well).\nSo imagine my excitement when, at the age of 39, I was formally introduced to \"Mr. Baseball.\"\nIt happened on opening day in 2011, my first season on the beat, in the visiting dugout at Great American Ball Park, where the Brewers and Cincinnati Reds were getting ready to square off. My partner on the beat, the venerable Tom Haudricourt, called me over to where Uecker was standing and informed him he'd be seeing a lot more of me at the ballpark.\nUecker offered a smile, extended his hand and shook mine. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I do know he was gracious and welcoming. And I was left awestruck, considering my newcomer status around the team.\nThe absolute coolest, most mind-blowing part? He remembered my name from that point forward. There was nothing like getting a, \"Hello, Todd!\" and a poke in the side as he walked into the clubhouse when we'd pass by each other in the pressbox. Just thinking back on those moments now makes me smile.\nUecker was, understandably, a very popular person on the road before he cut his travel schedule back and then stopped traveling at all to broadcast games. Fans in the stands clamored for him if he was in the dugout before the game, and visiting media, without fail, always tried its best to get a sound bite or two from the legend himself.\nProbably my favorite memory of Uecker away from Milwaukee was during one of the inevitable, interminable rain delays in Pittsburgh in the mid-2010s. Sitting in the print media's portion of the pressbox at PNC Park, the three members of Milwaukee's traveling party were doing their best to pass the time when Uecker emerged from the broadcast booth and sat down with us.\nBefore we knew it, 30 minutes had passed and we'd laughed like crazy, grateful for a respite from the boredom.\nAt home, it could be even better. It wasn't at all uncommon for Uecker to venture out into the dugout before batting practice had even started, greeting players, staffers and media members alike. Seeing Uecker and Carlos Gómez go in for their handshake and exclaiming \"Nice! Real nice!\" was always a hoot.\nAs the years passed and I felt more comfortable just sidling up and beginning a chat, I'd do so. And Uecker was always happy to oblige. Baseball was always an obvious topic, as was fishing. He loved talking about heading out onto Lake Michigan on his boat.\nBut to me, Uecker's best stories often involved the entertainment business.\nI'd make a point to ask a specific question about an actor he'd worked with on \"Mr. Belvedere\" or \"Major League\" and off to the races we went, hearing stories about something funny that happened during shooting on a specific day or a memory he had about a particular episode. It said something that all these years later (the final season aired in 1990) that Uecker was still in contact with all the cast members from \"Mr. Belvedere\" who were still alive.\nAnd then there were \"The Tonight Show\" stories. Simply incredible stuff, as Uecker would recall how his first appearance in 1969 came to be, and how that paved the way to over 100 more through Johnny Carson's retirement in 1992. A chat of 30 minutes or more wasn't at all uncommon.\nCarson himself, Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen, Redd Foxx, Dabney Coleman and so many more were quite the characters, as Uecker told it.\nMore than once Uecker left me so enraptured that I skipped my usual pregame duties in order to hear more (let's hope my bosses aren't reading this; if they are, I'm sorry and I'm sure you understand). Then, when it was time to part ways, I'd walk away tingling, fully aware of how lucky I was to have had that opportunity – and that he'd thought enough of me to give me the time.\nA few times, quick-thinking colleagues snapped pictures on their cell phones while we were talking then text them to me after. How appreciative I am of their thoughtfulness now.\nSpring training was always a treat, as well.\nWhat better way to start the long slog – \"Won't this season ever end?\" Haudricourt would comically and predictably bellow after the first pitch was thrown in Cactus League play – than to look to our right and see Uecker perched in his usual spot, calling the action.\nAnd should there be a scoring decision that Uecker didn't agree with, look out! The glare over from the radio booth was something to behold (and done in jest – most of the time).\nEvery spring up until 2024, Uecker would make time to update a couple of us ink-stained wretches on how his offseason went. Some sessions were easier than others; the winter he endured heading into the 2022 season with the passing of his daughter to ALS was a brutal one, but Uecker still told the story the best he could.\nUecker had spent the better part of an hour doing that particular interview, with longtime engineer and friend Kent Sommerfeld imploring him to get ready to get on the air at the tail end. We thanked Uecker for his time and, like always, he acted like we were doing him the favor.\n\"Shoot, you guys, anytime! Happy to do it!\"\nI snapped a few pictures of Uecker as we walked out of the booth that afternoon. The best one without a doubt was him pointing at me with a big smile on his face.\nThat image will always be in my mind.\nSo too, unfortunately, will be the moments immediately following the Brewers' Game 3 loss to the New York Mets in the teams' National League wild-card series at American Family Field.\nThe brutal nature of the loss itself had emotions running high for all associated with the team anyway. But then to see Uecker in the clubhouse making the rounds, presumably saying goodbye for the final time after having just called his final inning on the radio, was heartbreaking.\nThe tears streaming down the faces of Christian Yelich and Willy Adames told the story, even though what Uecker had actually told them at the time remained unspoken. The many staff members Uecker had grown close to over the years as well. These were true friends, people who had spent countless hours with Uecker both at home and on the road, shared laughs and meals with him.\nIt can't accurately be conveyed in words.\nAfter some time, Uecker began to make his way out of the clubhouse and into the service level of the ballpark, an area bustling with activity even after the most meaningless games. Countless family members milled about, most still in shock like everybody else.\nMaybe it wasn't my place, but I followed Uecker out the double doors. I quickly made my way to him and stuck out my hand. I couldn't really think of much to say – at that moment, what is appropriate? – and told him, simply, \"Thank you, Ueck.\"\nUecker grabbed my hand, shook it firmly and grabbed my arm with his other hand, looked me in the eyes and said, \"Thank you, Todd.\"\nOne of many goodbyes for Uecker on that night, and to someone who at best was on the very periphery of his life, a random guy he'd come to know at the ballpark years ago.\nBut I'm convinced he appreciated me taking the time. Lord knows, I'm so glad I had the opportunity.\nWhy did I thank Uecker?\nFor helping make me a baseball fan. For all the memorable calls on the radio. For all the enjoyment his acting provided me. For remembering my name. For all the laughs. For the time he gave me.\nFor being Mr. Baseball. For being Brewers baseball.\nThere will never be another. And the game in Milwaukee henceforth will never quite be the same.",

    "text": "MIAMI, Fla. — A Florida resident has filed a lawsuit against Netflix, alleging widespread buffering and streaming failures during the highly anticipated fight between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul last Friday night.\nRonald “Blue” Dalton submitted the complaint on Monday, just days after Paul, 27, defeated the 58-year-old Tyson by unanimous decision in an eight-round exhibition bout. The event, marketed as a blockbuster clash, left many viewers frustrated when technical glitches disrupted the streaming experience.\nThe lawsuit accuses Netflix of mishandling the digital distribution of the fight, which reportedly attracted record-breaking viewership numbers. “The most hyped fight in boxing history turned out to be a ‘record night,’ not for the fight(s) but for the money Netflix stole,” the complaint states.\nNakisa Bidarian, Paul’s copromoter and cofounder of Most Valuable Promotions, acknowledged the streaming issues but framed them as a testament to the event’s popularity. “I think, first and foremost, we broke the internet,” Bidarian said, highlighting the unprecedented demand, which reportedly surpassed the U.S. streaming record of 23 million concurrent viewers.\nNetflix admitted to facing “many technical challenges” during the event but claimed its efforts to manage the stream were “brilliant,” according to the lawsuit. However, Dalton’s complaint cites over 100,000 online complaints from frustrated viewers who experienced buffering, glitches, or total inaccessibility during the fight.\nThe event, which was also distributed to over 6,000 bars and restaurants nationwide, is being touted as the largest digital distribution for combat sports. The lawsuit adds to mounting criticism of Netflix’s ability to handle live events.\nStreaming woes during a blockbuster bout have landed Netflix in legal trouble, with frustrated viewers demanding accountability.",

The aircraft quickly gained a reputation for its exceptional performance and versatility. It played a crucial role in various conflicts, including the Vietnam War, where its advanced capabilities proved invaluable.\nIn addition to the USAF, the Royal Australian Air Force also recognized the potential of the F-111 and acquired the F-111C variant in 1973. The RAAF operated the Aardvark for several decades, utilizing its capabilities in various missions, including long-range strike operations.\nVariants and Upgrades:\nThroughout its service life, the F-111 Aardvark underwent several upgrades and modifications, resulting in different variants. These variants included the F-111A, F-111B, F-111C, F-111D, and F-111F, each tailored to specific mission requirements.\nThe F-111B, for instance, was optimized for electronic warfare, while the F-111D focused on long-range strike capabilities. These variants showcased the adaptability and versatility of the Aardvark platform.\nRetirement and Legacy:\nAfter several decades of dedicated service, the F-111 Aardvark was eventually retired from active duty. The USAF retired its last F-111s in 1996, while the RAAF phased out its Aardvarks in 2010.\nDespite its retirement, the F-111 Aardvark remains an iconic aircraft in aviation history. Its groundbreaking design, exceptional performance, and versatility have left a lasting legacy. The Aardvark paved the way for future advancements in military aviation and continues to be admired by aviation enthusiasts worldwide.\nConclusion:\nThe General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark stands as a testament to human ingenuity and engineering excellence. Its impact on military aviation cannot be overstated, and its legacy continues to inspire future generations of aviators and aerospace engineers.",
