    "text": "- The lottery and gaming credit can reduce a homeowner's property tax bill - The credit amount varies; someone who lives in the Green Bay School District could save $275 - Watch the video for details on how to claim the credit They are five words that can be worth hundreds of dollars: The lottery and gaming credit. It is applied to a homeowner's annual property taxes, as basically a discount on the total amount due. Catherine Oreto, a Green Bay resident, learned about the credit from a reporter's phone call. \"That's kind of exciting, I would be excited to get $275 back on my taxes,\" Oreto said. The amount of the credit is based on the school district you live in - everyone who lives in a given district gets the same credit. In the Green Bay Area and Howard-Suamico school districts, the credit this year is about $275. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue urged qualifying homeowners to check their property tax bills to make sure the credit was applied. To qualify: -Be a Wisconsin resident -As of 1/1/23, have owned your home and used it as your primary residence. Until January 31, homeowners can apply using [this form](https://www.revenue.wi.gov/DORForms/23lc-100f.pdf) at the treasurer's office that collects their property taxes. After that, a refund can be requested from the state. The Brown County treasurer's office sent out 8,000 letters this year to homeowners who likely qualified but had not signed up for the credit, said Deputy Brown County Treasurer Chuck Mahlik. About half of the letter recipients signed up for the credit, Mahlik said. Once a homeowner signs up, it is not necessary to sign up again in future years for the same residence.",

    "text": "Nathan Le Gohlisse Hardware Specialist April 11, 2024 at 3:06 p.m.\n0\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 © Mathieu Grumiaux for Clubic For its Apple Watch Series 10, Apple is reportedly banking on new OLED screen technology. However, there is no need to expect a visual evolution: this essentially technical change would rather offer better energy efficiency, and therefore increased autonomy.\nIf it takes care to correct the craziest bugs in its current Watch Series 9, Apple is not losing sight of the development of its future exciting connected device. Expected at the start of the 2024 school year alongside the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 would benefit from new OLED screen technology intended to boost its autonomy.\nTowards greater autonomy? As reported The Elec , Apple would indeed adopt a new LTPO TFT OLED panel for its new Apple Watch. Behind this somewhat complex name is an OLED screen combining LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) and TFT (Thin-film transistor) technologies to improve energy efficiency without reducing display quality.\nIn detail, we nevertheless learn that the LTPS technology previously used on the Apple Watch would still be used, but marginally, only on the non-visible parts of the screen.\nThe next Apple Watch will feature LTPO TFT OLED technology © Apple A technology also expected on the iPhone 16 Pro This new technology would not, however, be exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 10. According to Apple Insider , Apple would also extend it to its future iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Subsequently, these LTPO TFT OLED screens would even be adopted on all iPhone 17s, expected next year, always with the objective of improving energy efficiency… and by extension, the autonomy of the equipped devices.\nFinally, note that this information has a good chance of being correct, because if The Elec is sometimes wrong in its predictions relating to future Apple products, the media is rarely wrong when it comes to the integration of new technologies into them. In this area, his careful observation of supply chains often allows him to hit the mark.\nSource : Apple Insider\nNathan Le Gohlisse\nHardware Specialist\nHardware Specialist\nPassionate about new technologies, History and old Rock since I was very young, I am a PCist who has sunk body and soul into the delights of macOS.

    "text": "Joey Lawrence finally addressed those cheating allegations — and dropped a major bombshell accusation about his estranged wife in the process!\nOne day after Samantha Cope filed to end their two-year marriage, the actor was accused of cheating on her with his married co-star of his upcoming film Socked In for Christmas , Melina Alves . Her estranged husband, Edward Rider , claimed in divorce documents that the pair were having an affair, which he discovered back in March. Melina denied the cheating allegations , claiming she and Joey had a “meaningful friendship” and nothing more! In fact, she makes a point to say they did not have a “sexual relationship” while they “were on set filming.” Hmm. But that doesn’t mean something did not happen afterwards…\nRelated: Ryan Reynolds Cheated On Scarlett Johansson & Blake Lively KILLED The Story!\nJoey is also now insisting nothing happened, though! He took to Instagram on Thursday to finally speak out about the divorce and the affair rumors, writing:\n“With a deep sense of responsibility, I want to respond to the recent allegations surrounding my personal life, including my divorce and the claims of an affair with Melina Alves. Melina and I became close friends and I did not have a physical relationship with her while filming the movie ‘Socked in for Christmas.’ These rumors are false. Our bond was based on shared experiences and an understanding of the challenges we were both facing in our personal lives.”\nAgain with the wording…\nSimilar to Melina, Joey noted he “did not have a physical relationship with her while filming the movie ‘ Socked in for Christmas .’” And it is that “while filming” part that is raising our eyebrows. Because he is not saying they never had a “physical relationship” for any random, single day in their lives. Or after filming! Just that they both made it a point to say nothing happened between them when they worked on the film together. If it is true and something didn’t happen on set, is it possible that they got VERY cozy after filming wrapped???\nHowever, Joey appears to be sticking with the story that they were just “close friends” and nothing more! He is, instead, placing the blame for the divorce entirely on Samantha! And no, the 48-year-old singer is not accusing her of being the one to cheat. What he claims ruined their marriage hits a little too close to home — literally. Joey explained:\n“At the time I met Melina, I was in the midst of a deeply troubled marriage. I was clinging to the hope that I could save a relationship that, in my heart, I knew was beyond saving. My short-lived marriage was fraught with difficulties from the beginning. Our differences became insurmountable.”\nTheir relationship was “fraught with difficulties from the beginning”??? Hmm. We mean, the pair did move pretty fast as they tied the knot only three months after the Blossom alum finalized his divorce from Chandie Yawn-Nelson ! Perhaps he and Samantha moved too fast. You know, before they got the chance to see if they were a good match! Anyways…\nJoey then went on to drop a bomb! He claimed Samantha, with whom he shares baby Dylan Rose , didn’t like his and his ex-wife’s 18-year-old daughter Charleston and 14-year-old daughter Liberty , saying:\n“As a father, my three daughters are my world. They are, and always will be, my top priority. The unraveling of my marriage was tied to my realization that there was no way my two eldest daughters were ever going to be accepted by my wife to be part of my family. I cannot and will not compromise on the love and care that my daughters deserve, and this realization played a significant role in the breakdown of my relationship.”\nWHAT?!?!\nJoey continued:\n“I understand that my life is often in the public eye, and with that comes a level of scrutiny that can be difficult to bear. However, I must emphasize that the well being of my children is of the utmost importance. Thank you for your understanding and respect as I navigate this difficult chapter in my families life.”\nRead the entire statement (below):\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Joey Lawrence (@joeylawrence)\nHis comments are bound to get Samantha talking more about the divorce and cheating rumors now, right? We cannot imagine she will stay silent on the drama for much longer because he is throwing out a wild accusation about her! Reactions to the latest in the messy divorce, Perezcious readers?

    "title": "Anti-Semitism: A Central Feature in Leftist Thought",
    "text": "Robert S. Wistrich was the Neuburger Professor of European and Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the director of the university’s Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism. He may also have been the leading academic authority on anti-Semitism. Witness his histories\nA Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism From Antiquity to the Global Jihad(2010) and From Ambivalence to Betrayal: The Left, The Jews and Israel (2012). Professor Wistrich died in 2015 at the age of 70. The New York Times obituary by Sam Roberts is here. Would that he were alive in this hour.\nI interviewed Professor Wistrich by email in connection with his 2012 book. It occurred to me that it might be a good time to revisit the interview. Here it is.\nPL: You begin your new book with an autobiographical account dating back to your time on the Left. How did you get from there to here, so to speak?\nRSW: I belonged, at one point, to the radical 1968 generation in the West who were intoxicated (in my case, briefly) with the secular utopianism of radical Marxism and the mirage of “cultural revolution.” I was physically present in Paris when the French students shouted “We are all German Jews” in support of their leader “Dany the Red,” who had just been prevented by De Gaulle from returning from Germany to France. Today, their equivalents in Europe might well be shouting “Death to Israel” or “Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!” That is one strand of the journey that led me to retrospectively subject the contemporary Left to intense critical scrutiny.\nPL: Would you talk a little bit about your scholarly interest in the subject of anti-Semitism?\nRSW: Ever since I was a student at Cambridge University in the late 1960s (and probably much earlier), I have been both intrigued and repulsed by the sheer persistence of anti-Semitism in its many forms. Living as I did in Great Britain for the first thirty years of my life, I always felt an outsider and my Jewish identity was clearly part of that. The more that I subsequently studied the history of Jew-hatred, the more I began to see it as an embedded part of the cultural DNA of the West (especially of European history). The return of anti-Semitism in our time – much of it under the guise of loathing Israel – has confirmed for me its near-ubiquity and perennial nature. But already in 1991, I had invented the term “the longest hatred” to describe its extraordinary tenacity.\nPL: What would you like prospective readers to know about your book?\nRSW: I believe that my most recent book does expose for the first time in such a systematic fashion the enduring Judeophobic passions prevalent in so many left-wing revolutionary movements; the emptiness of the dream of “proletarian solidarity”; and the political fantasy-world of Communist egalitarianism, some of it ardently espoused by Jewish intellectuals. Moreover, my book unmistakably shows that conspiracy theories are as much a proclivity of the Left as of the Right. I see it as a much-needed demystification of all the standard leftist stereotypes and delusions about the Jews and Israel, whose exposure is long overdue.\nPL: Would you briefly summarize your findings for us?\nRSW: One of the key points in my study is that anti-Semitism has been an important feature of left-wing thought ever since its beginnings in the 1840s with Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. This animosity derives in part from a distorted post-Christian Enlightenment perception of Judaism as a fundamentally reactionary tribalist religion and an obstacle to “human emancipation”; from a grossly simplistic identification of Jews with banks, money, financial speculation and capitalist injustices; as well as a stubborn refusal in our own time to recognize the indubitably national character of the Jewish people and the overwhelming historic legitimacy of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel.\nPL: What role did the Soviet Union play in creating the current anti-Semitism and its tropes?\nRSW: The Soviet Union may have collapsed in 1991 but twenty years later, we can still see in the West, the Middle East and in the Third World the truly poisonous legacy of its vile demonology concerning the Jews and Israel. All the more malevolent and mendacious amalgams of our own day, equating Zionism with racism, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, fascism, Nazism and the totally imaginary “genocide” of the Palestinians were originally concoctions of the Soviet propaganda apparatus. That is rarely understood and mostly forgotten.\nPL: What has been the response of the Left to your book? Silence or disagreement?\nRSW: Not surprisingly, there are few on the Left willing or able to accept the challenge that I’ve thrown down to them or to revise their tired and worn-out dogmas. The last thing that one can accuse the leftists I write about (and their heirs) of being is open-minded or self-critical.\nPL: How does left-wing anti-Semitism fit into the history of anti-Semitism?\nRSW: Left-wing anti-Semitism is a consistently underrated feature of the history of Jew-hatred since the mid-19th century. One aspect that makes it rather unusual is that it usually adopts a secular, rationalist and “universalist” standpoint; that it purports to be humanistic and in its “anti-Zionist” mutation usually clothes itself in the banner of human rights and preaches defense of the “oppressed” – especially the Palestinians. This world-view sounds nice on paper but in practice it does not immunize leftists from falling into a morass of self-delusion, bias and prejudice against Jews or Israelis, even though this is often vehemently contested. This is an anti-Semitism which denies its name.\nPL: Do you see an alliance between the Left and Islamists based on their shared hatreds? If so, would you elaborate on that?\nRSW: The radical Left and the Islamists do share a common hatred of the West (especially America) and of Israel as symbols of successful modernity, entrepreneurial capitalism and secular freedoms. They increasingly align with one another over “solidarity” with Palestine, rejection of any American involvement in the Middle East, and in their efforts to subvert the moral foundations of Western culture. Such is the potency of these irrational hatreds that they even trump the Left’s traditional support for causes like women’s emancipation and gay rights – which are total anathema to Islamists.\nPL: What is at stake for those of us outside Israel in the Islamist war against Israel?\nRSW: The Islamist onslaught against Israel is to a considerable extent a war by proxy against the West – in which defense of the Jewish State becomes the litmus-test for Islamic probing whether the Western world is really serious about commitment to its core-values of individual freedom and liberal democracy. The Islamic radicals are today not only the spearhead of an annihilationist anti-Jewish ideology but also of a fanatical jihadist war against civilization as it has hitherto been understood in the West.\nPL: Anything else you’d like to add?\nRSW: In conclusion, I would simply add that the contemporary Left can no longer claim any kind of moral high ground. It has never truly come to terms with the abominable crimes of the Stalinist regimes, with the Soviet Gulag and Communist totalitarianism. Its uncritical and selective solidarity with “victims” like the Palestinians is highly suspect; its relentless efforts to blacken the good name of America and Israel at all costs are often grotesque; its frequent whitewashing of Islamic extremism and naked terrorism are morally reprehensible; and its Judeophobic legacy requires urgent detoxification. Anti-Semitism, I would maintain, has always been a remarkably accurate barometer for measuring bigoted, prejudiced and dogmatic attitudes, not to mention blatant double standards. Much of the contemporary Left, when it comes to the Jews and especially to Israel, has miserably failed the test of elementary honesty and intellectual integrity.",

The latest incident was the assault on a school housing displaced persons in the Nuseirat camp in Gaza on Thursday, which is a violation of international law, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. The ministry's spokesperson Sufian Qudah reiterated the Kingdom's condemnation and denunciation of these actions and crimes, which violate the rules of international law. He added that these acts contradict all human and ethical values and represent war crimes that the international community must confront and hold the perpetrators accountable. Qudah called on the international community to assume responsibility, deter Israel from committing further crimes against civilians, and put an end to its war on the Gaza Strip. He also emphasised the necessity of forcing Israel to respect international law and called for concerted efforts to stop Israeli aggression on Gaza.

    "text": "Thank you Volunteers! The greatest commandment that Jesus gave us so that we can honour God is about putting love into action. By serving others we can make a difference and change lives. And this week we give our heartfelt thanks to all who volunteer. My first recollection of being a volunteer was my experience of Brownies. I was asked to visit an elderly person and prepare a tea for her along with 2 other brownies. At the end of the experience we were awarded our hospitality badge to proudly sew onto our uniforms. The ethos of doing a good deed every day and thinking of others who might need help is the motivation of many a volunteer. And where would the Church of England, and our communities be without them? During Covid and the lockdowns, we were all so grateful for those people who volunteered to help their neighbours, and take on extra responsibilities in order to ensure people stayed safe. So from offering to collect online shopping, to making phone calls to talk to people on their own, or applying to help at vaccination centres, and the many other tasks to help, people showed their love and concern for one another. For this demonstration of our common loving spirt we were truly grateful. Did you know that across the UK an estimated 14.2 Million people volunteer, and many of them are in our parishes. So thank you to all who make up a community of volunteers ready to step in and support wherever a need is perceived. In my parishes and in my role as Archdeacon in Derbyshire, it never ceased to amaze me how much everyone did to keep the show on the road. There are wardens, PCC members, Junior church leaders, church openers, welcomers, cleaners, flower arrangers, Mothers Union members, musicians, readers, sacristans, vergers, singers, bell ringers, magazine editors, website/ social media technicians, churchyard gardeners etc etc. There are far too many to mention them all, but without the vital team of people willing to offer their time, expertise and experience our parish, villages, and communities would be bereft. In our Diocese of Southwark we celebrate those called to serve in ministry, lay and ordained, those who give their time and a variety of gifts to serve. Those in lay ministry are mainly volunteers, licensed, commissioned and affirmed. People use their different expertise, God’s gifts in a calling to spread the love of God into people’s hearts. From Readers preaching God’s word, to Pastoral Lay Ministers, Children, Youth and Family Ministers, Pioneer ministers, and Evangelists. They all give their time. Everyone has something unique to offer. There are School Pastors and Street Pastors, those who are called to work often in places of great need. There are people who run a homeless shelters, provide community lunches, work with refugees, run the food banks. All are examples of Christian Love in Action. Where would our churches be without volunteers, but also where would we all be without that famous Cuppa ! So here are a couple of “Tea” Stories to share with you… Tea@2 For more than 10 years the Mothers Union have been providing Tea@2 in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of St Thomas’/Evelina London Children’s Hospital. Members from across the Diocese provide a relaxed space, homemade cakes and a listening ear for the parents of the tiny babies being cared for. Some of the babies are in the Unit for several months, and the parents are there most of the time. It is hugely rewarding listening to the parents, and offering support whilst they are in these stressful situations. We often find that there are parents who haven’t met before, as their babies are at different stages on their journey, who can share experiences and reassure one another. In 2023, several volunteers received awards from the hospital for 5 or 10 year’s service. Drop in Teas Celebrating 12 years of service, from a relatively small village church community Margaret Miller writes from St Michael’s Betchworth “Teas began in 2011 when it was realised that there wasn’t a social meeting event in Betchworth. Over the past 12 years, missing out during Covid, our team of Volunteer cake and biscuit makers, tea & coffee servers and those able to sit and chat to our visitors has changed. We now have a group of 8 helpers, who once a month run the Afternoon Teas in the Hamilton Room, in the centre of the village. All cakes etc are home-baked and we ask for donations to help local and national charities. So far we have raised £2,800.00 for adult and children’s charities, helping among others the homeless, Food Bank, those unemployed, children with life-limiting conditions, the hospice and bringing music to disabled children and their families, as well as refugees from Ukraine and medical research charities. Numbers vary but usually we have between 15 and 30 visitors, plus a couple of well- behaved dogs. Visitors come from the local villages and also a fair few walkers exploring our local footpaths”. “There are varieties of activities but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone” (1 Corinthians 12: 6) To find out more about how you can celebrate the volunteers in your community go to [https://volunteersweek.org/](https://volunteersweek.org/) So for all our volunteers both great and small – a HUGE THANK- YOU !
