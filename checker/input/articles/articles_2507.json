    "title": "General : Ngeh's Proposal To Have Non-muslim Experts In Syariah Law Committee A Mistake - Loke",
    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 29 (Bernama) -- DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke today stressed that the proposal by Beruas Member of Parliament Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham for the government to appoint non-Muslim legal experts into the special committee to study issues related to the competencies of state legislative assembly in enacting Islamic laws was a mistake and misunderstanding about the committee’s source of power.\nRealising that the proposal could spark controversy as DAP would be seen trying to meddle in Islamic legal affairs, Loke asserted that this is entirely untrue because the party is committed to the principle of mutual respect and harmony among religions and ethnicities.\n“The committee was established by the Malaysian National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI), chaired by the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, and aims to advise the council with suggestions to empower and elevate the jurisdictions of Syariah Courts.\n“It should be emphasised that the establishment of this special committee is not determined by the Cabinet but by MKI, and they report directly to MKI. DAP respects the wisdom of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Selangor in making any decisions regarding MKI affairs,” he said in a statement today.\nLoke said any proposals by the special committee involving legal amendments must be brought to the Cabinet for the usual process of legal enactments.\nAs such, Loke said non-Muslim communities need not worry about this matter because any legal amendments involving the rights of non-Muslims must be thoroughly discussed and finalised by the Cabinet before being brought to Parliament.\nYesterday, the media reported that Ngeh proposed the government appoint experts from the non-Muslim community to assist the special committee established earlier this month and to ensure that the non-Muslims' views were considered before making any changes to the laws.\nThe proposal, however, was slammed by UMNO secretary-general Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, who said that there was no need for non-Muslim experts to be appointed to the special committee.\nMeanwhile, Bangi Member of Parliament Syahredzan Johan through a post of X today, echoed Asyraf Wajdi’s sentiments, saying that he believed that the members of the special committee are experienced and competent in their respective fields, especially constitutional law, and would be able to conduct an objective study, going beyond considerations of their own ethnicity and religion.\n“Furthermore, the committee’s suggestions or findings are not binding on the Cabinet, and I believe that all views and further engagement sessions will be conducted before any suggestions are accepted and implemented.\n“Therefore, there is no reason to say that the views or suggestions presented to the government will be limited to one party,” he said, adding that all parties should give space to the committee to continue what has been entrusted to them to start addressing the issues that need to be fully resolved.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

    "title": "Canada's prime minister's residence is rat-plagued and rotting. Nobody knows what to do. - POLITICO",
    "text": "24 Sussex Drive is officially the official home of the prime minister. Truthfully, it’s rodent-plagued and rotting, a running joke that has been all but abandoned. OTTAWA, Ontario — You might think dead rodents in the walls of the Canadian prime minister’s official residence would be cause for alarm, but you’d be wrong. After all, the pests are only the latest indignity to befall the 155-year-old mansion at 24 Sussex Drive. The government has deemed the 34-room stone building an uninhabitable fire trap with leaky plumbing and asbestos in the walls — alongside the carcasses, that is. Justin Trudeau, who spent much of his childhood at 24 Sussex while his father was prime minister, did not move back in when he took on the role in 2015. And it’s unclear if the decaying residence will ever be occupied by another Canadian leader. In the Canadian capital of Ottawa, the fate of 24 Sussex is part running joke, part national embarrassment. There is general consensus that something must be done, but no agreement about what that thing is. Some say the mansion should be restored as a symbol of the country’s political heritage. Others say the exorbitant cost of a proper renovation and limited heritage value means it makes more sense to tear the whole thing down and start anew. Radio-Canada, the French language arm of Canada’s public broadcaster, reported over the summer that the federal government was finally ready to rip off the Band-Aid and abandon 24 Sussex. Unnamed sources told Radio-Canada the government was considering several options for new digs, including a secluded parcel of land in a nearby park that sits astride the Ottawa River, another site where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police host iconic musical rides, and the Rideau Cottage building — a government-owned residence on the sprawling grounds of the governor general’s estate, where Trudeau has lived since 2015. A local heritage nonprofit, Historic Ottawa Development Inc., opposes any such move, arguing that rehabilitation estimates for 24 Sussex, generated for public officials by consultants, are grossly overblown. On goes the debate, forever and ever. No final decision has been made, because for decades, a string of Liberal and Conservative prime ministers have not wanted to bear the political cost of pouring millions into their personal digs. So 24 Sussex sits and rots while successive governments look the other way. It is, one could argue, a symbol of a nation that abhors ostentatious displays of nationalism and power. Or, less charitably, it is symptomatic of a populist tendency to condemn any government expenditure that might prove Canada’s elected leaders are out of touch. Either way, there are dead rodents in the walls of 24 Sussex Drive, and they’ve been met with little more than a collective shrug. The stories about 24 Sussex are the stuff of Canadian lore. Margaret Trudeau, Justin’s mother and former wife of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, once called it “the crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system.” (Former U.S. President Bill Clinton described the White House the same way.) The residence has been the official home of Canadian prime ministers since the 1950s, and has played host to Winston Churchill and John and Jacqueline Kennedy. But it’s had few major renovations and gradually deteriorated over the decades. The National Capital Commission, which owns the property and other official residences, now deems it to be in critical condition , to the point where crumbling stones could fall from the walls at any moment. The place is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien once plugged in a space heater and knocked out power to the whole home. And there was the sweltering luncheon hosted by Brian Mulroney in August 1992, when an air conditioner had to be turned off every time someone rose to speak because the electricity was too weak to power it and a microphone at the same time. Plastic sheeting has been used to keep the cold from seeping through the sunroom windows. In a 2005 TV sketch , comedian Rick Mercer took then-Prime Minister Paul Martin to a Canadian Tire store to pick up rolls of the stuff and showed him how to fix it to the windows with a hair dryer. In the summer, the house is cooled by window air conditioning units in each room. A 2011 report, obtained by an Ottawa newspaper years later , found the ancient wiring posed a “serious” fire hazard to Stephen Harper, Trudeau’s predecessor and the last prime minister to live in the official residence. But fixing it would have been tricky, as it would have involved disturbing the asbestos in the walls. Then, in November 2022, the NCC announced it was closing 24 Sussex . The house had been unoccupied since 2015, but the kitchen was still being used to prepare meals for the Trudeau family. In April, the National Post newspaper obtained documents listing a litany of urgent concerns that had prompted the closure — among them an “important rodent infestation.” NCC staff were using bait to kill the critters, but that meant “excrement and carcasses” were building up in the walls, leading to “real concerns with air quality.” The prime minister’s residence doesn’t have the storied history of No. 10 Downing St. or the White House. The 34-room mansion was built on a cliff overlooking the Ottawa River in the mid-19th century by a lumber baron as a wedding gift for his third wife. The government expropriated the property in the 1940s to consolidate Crown ownership of the lands along the river, but then spent several years unsure what to do with it. Renovations at the end of the decade relieved the house of most of its historic charm. The first prime minister to move in, Louis St. Laurent, did so reluctantly in 1951. Before then, Canadian leaders did not have any fixed address in Ottawa. Unlike the White House, 24 Sussex is primarily a residence for prime ministers and their families and is rarely open to the public. Government business is conducted in offices on Parliament Hill, and foreign dignitaries are often hosted at the much larger Rideau Hall — or at 7 Rideau Gate, a separate guesthouse across the street from 24 Sussex. Back in the day, the house’s occupants used to leave their mark on the place, but that quickly became controversial. Pierre Trudeau famously built a pool house on the property in 1975, paid for with C$200,000 from private donors whose identities were never revealed. His wife, Margaret, redecorated a sitting room to create a space where she could escape public life, calling it her “freedom room.” A rapid succession of prime ministers and opposition leaders in the late 1970s and early 1980s caused public outcry for repeatedly redecorating their official residences to suit their tastes using public funds. Mulroney, elected in 1984, tried to cool the controversy by establishing a council to advise on future changes to the houses (the NCC took on the responsibility in 1988). But soon enough Mulroney was caught up in the so-called Gucci-gate scandal, when it was revealed in 1987 that the Progressive Conservative Party paid C$308,000 to refurbish 24 Sussex and Harrington Lake, the prime minister’s country home outside Ottawa. The details reported at the time — a closet designed to hold 50 pairs of Gucci loafers, custom carpets replaced four times, a new bathroom with a whirlpool tub — were tailor-made to enrage a Canadian public obsessed with government profligacy. The problem, however, was that even as Canadians howled about the cost of aesthetic changes to the house, structural repairs weren’t being done. When Chrétien was elected in 1993, 24 Sussex was already showing signs of neglect. The Liberal prime minister, keen to signal a departure from the Mulroney era, spent almost nothing on refurbishing the place when he moved in. One newspaper noted a C$501 bill for drapes from Ikea. Frugality became the norm. In 2008, the auditor general estimated the cost of repairs at nearly C$10 million, but Harper, elected two years earlier, declined to move out to allow the renovations to happen. The NCC, citing a consultant’s estimate from 2017, said in 2021 that it would cost C$36.6 million to restore the building. When Trudeau came to power in 2015 and opted not to move into 24 Sussex with his then-wife and three young children, it seemed the NCC might finally be given the money to do repairs it had long deemed urgent. But it was not to be. Like his predecessors, Trudeau has so far chosen not to deal with the problem, and has been fairly candid about the reason. “No prime minister wants to spend a penny of taxpayer dollars on upkeeping that house,” he said in 2018 . Trudeau has good reason to be leery of pouring money into 24 Sussex. Though there have been many editorials and op-eds bemoaning the house’s decay , Canadian media spends far more time meticulously documenting cases of superfluous government spending. For instance, what many Canadians will remember about the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022 is that Trudeau stayed in a London hotel suite that cost C$6,000 per night. There’s a certain irony to that one: The prime minister once helped force the resignation of a Conservative Cabinet minister who expensed a C$16 glass of orange juice at London’s swanky Savoy Hotel. A controversy over the cost of in-flight catering during the governor general’s international trips prompted a parliamentary study and protocol changes, including the elimination of drink garnishes aboard government planes. And the debate about 24 Sussex has occasionally been punctuated by news about the growing cost of renovations at Harrington Lake — estimated last year at close to C$12 million — which has provided ample fodder for the opposition Conservatives to paint Trudeau as an entitled spendthrift. Canadians know this fixation sets them apart from their American neighbors. Back in 1988, a Toronto Star columnist accused the country of a “Scrooge mentality” and observed that Americans “enjoy seeing their leaders living like royalty.” Thirty-five years later, an editorial in The Globe and Mail newspaper castigated Canadians for “the worst kind of populism, one in which politicians theatrically spurn even the most basic trappings of power.” But even if the government decided to act, there’s no agreement about what should be done. Polls show Canadians are divided about whether to renovate the place or tear it down . It was labeled a classified heritage building in 1986, but some argue its historical value was lost when it was gutted in 1950. In the meantime, ironically, 24 Sussex continues to cost taxpayers money. One news report from 2016 pegged the maintenance costs at C$180,000 over five months , including for electricity and snow removal. The NCC has previously floated the idea of a new, larger residence that would serve as a home for the prime minister and a space to host diplomatic visits and official events — in essence, something more like the White House. Some say Canadians should not be so keen to emulate the United States. After all, the prime minister is not the country’s head of state. But others argue when it comes to 24 Sussex Drive, Canada could afford to be a little more American. “Despite sharp differences of opinion in contentious political areas, our hearts continue to beat with similar rhythms,” wrote Ottawa Citizen columnist Janice Kennedy in 2010. “Except where grandness of vision is concerned. Americans have it, cherish it, nurture it. We’ve forgotten what it even looks like.” Thirteen years later, Canadians will have to settle for getting the rodents — and maybe the asbestos — out of the walls.",

    "text": "Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco did not show up Thursday morning to answer a summons in the Dominican Republic pertaining to allegations he engaged in relationships with minors.\nFranco, 22, was ordered to meet with authorities from the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office for Children and Adolescents in the city of Santo Domingo at 11 a.m. local time. Local newspaper Listin Diario posted a video to social media at about 11:45 a.m. that showed officials waiting for his arrival and listing him as a no-show, and agency director Olga Dina Llaverias later confirmed he did not appear.\nReports Thursday from the Dominican Republic also said that Franco had fired his legal team, and Dina Llaverias said the agency would continue building its case.\n“There are a few options in the investigative process, but now is not an opportune time to speak about that,” Dina Llaverias said.\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic conducted a pair of searches Tuesday looking for Franco but were unable to find him, according to the newspaper.\nAt least two people have filed lawsuits against Franco, and he is under investigation for an alleged improper relationship with a third minor, ESPN reported.\nWhile no legal charges have been filed, Dominican-based MLB reporter Hector Gomez posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday: “New evidence has been found in the case of Wander Franco that further implicates him in the accusations that have been made against him of alleged relationships with minors.”\nThe Rays placed Franco on the restricted list Aug. 14 and then on paid administrative leave on Aug. 22 as MLB launched an investigation into social media posts indicating Franco was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a minor.\nFranco since was moved to Tampa Bay’s active roster, but only because administrative leave is unavailable during the offseason. He could be placed back on administrative leave when spring training begins.\nFranco, who was first called up in 2021 as one of the most hyped prospects in recent years, played a career-high 112 games and was an All-Star for the first time in 2023. He set career highs in virtually all statistical categories, including home runs (17), RBIs (58), steals (30) and runs (65) while batting .281 with a .344 on-base percentage and a .475 slugging percentage.\n–Field Level Media",

    "title": "NorthEast Community Bancorp, Inc. Announces Increase in Quarterly Cash Dividend and Special Cash Dividend",
    "text": "Northeast Community Bancorp Boosts Shareholder Returns with Increased Dividends: A Strategic Move in a Competitive Financial Landscape In a pivotal announcement, NorthEast Community Bancorp, Inc. has declared an increase in both its quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend, marking a notable move to enhance returns for its shareholders. This proactive strategy comes at a time when businesses across sectors are re-evaluating their financial practices in the wake of economic fluctuations. Key Highlights of the Announcement: Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend: NorthEast Community Bancorp has raised its regular quarterly cash dividend, demonstrating confidence in its financial stability and future growth. Special Cash Dividend: Alongside the regular dividend increase, the board has also approved a special cash dividend, offering shareholders an additional return on their investment. Current Dividend Payout Ratio: As of Q2 2024, the company?s twelve-month dividend payout ratio has decreased to 5.2%, a figure that is significant when placed against the backdrop of its historical performance, which averaged a much higher 5564.81%. Relative Performance: In the competitive realm of the Financial sector, Northeast Community Bancorp?s dividend payout ratio places it behind 384 other companies, yet it still manages to rank higher than 1128 out of all firms considered, indicating it is still maintaining favorable relative standing despite the lower payout ratio. Impact on Company Shares: The implications of these changes in dividend policy are multi-faceted for Northeast Community Bancorp?s shareholders and stock performance. An increase in dividends typically signals a company?s strong financial health, which can attract new investors and potentially drive up the stock price. Investor Confidence: The hike in dividends has the potential to bolster investor confidence. Shareholders generally view increased dividends as a positive sign, suggesting that the company is generating robust cash flows and is willing to share those profits. Market Reaction: Generally, increased dividend announcements can lead to an uptick in stock prices as investors buy shares in anticipation of higher returns. However, the fact that the payout ratio has decreased could complicate investor perception, especially against comparisons to the companyns averages and peers. Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Returns: While the enhancement in dividends is appealing, it may prompt discussions among shareholders regarding the trade-off between immediate returns versus long-term growth potential. Investors might question whether the funds allocated to dividends could have been reinvested back into the business for expansions or improvements. Comparative Positioning: The relative ranking in terms of dividend payout shows that Northeast Community Bancorp remains competitive albeit with a slightly prudent approach. This can attract a certain demographic of investors attracted to sustainable growth over unsustainable high dividend yields. In summary, NorthEast Community Bancorpns decision to increase dividends reflects a solid strategic position while also addressing the investor basens desire for immediate returns. The stock market?s reception to this announcement, paired with its competitive standing amongst peers, will play a crucial role in the companyns valuation in the coming months. How this dual approach fares in terms of boosting share price and attracting new investments remains to be seen but positions the bank favorably in a volatile financial landscape. In the face of evolving economic conditions, NorthEast Community Bancorpns proactive measures may pave the way for sustained performance, appealing to both conservative investors and those seeking growth.,",
