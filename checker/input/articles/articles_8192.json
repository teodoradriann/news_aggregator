Porém, na avaliação do chefe do Executivo, ainda é cedo para tomar uma decisão, pois ainda não houve condenação de todos.\n“Sou favorável à anistia, briguei muito para ter anistia no Brasil. Mas, nesse caso, a gente ainda nem puniu todo mundo, a gente nem descobriu todo mundo, estamos procurando gente, financiador”, disse o presidente em entrevista à Rádio Itatiaia, nesta quinta-feira, 27.\nLula afirmou que ainda está em discussão o retorno dos brasileiros envolvidos nos atos golpistas que saíram do Brasil “para dar a eles a lição que merecem”. “Quem sabe, o tempinho que ficarem preso, aprendem que a democracia é bom.”\n“Não dá para precipitar essa discussão de anistia. O que temos é terminar de apurar as denúncias do 8 de janeiro”, disse. “Você pode até ver pessoas que estão presas há muito tempo, anistia é para isso.

Advertisement This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jesús Lucero Ezquerro, 28, who lives in the Poblats Marítims district of Valencia, Spain.\nThe region has been ravaged by flash floods . Ezquerro spoke to BI on Thursday. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nI've lived in Valencia for four years. Everything seemed normal on Monday — literally, nothing happened.\nBut at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, things started getting ugly in most of the province. It was starting to rain and get very windy.\nAdvertisement Around 7:30 p.m., we started getting texts from local authorities alerting us of heavy rains and urging us to stay home.\nI said to myself: \"Holy cow! But it's not raining here.\" I'm north of the river Turia in Valencia, so I wasn't affected and it hardly rained.\nI was shocked and alarmed by the images I started seeing on social media of people south of the river. People stuck in trees , people being pulled from a torrent by rope , people screaming.\nI didn't have a car or any vehicle when the storm hit, so I couldn't do anything but stay put. I wasn't scared as I don't have a business to worry about and live on the fifth floor of my building.\nAdvertisement But I was and still am worried about those affected and the innocent lives being lost. By the time the alerts came, the storm had already hit.\nBack to the Middle Ages The next day, a friend and I biked to see the damage in southern Valencia, the area most affected by the storm.\nThe metropolitan transport system had collapsed, the subways were flooded, and the buses could not access some areas.\nBefore even reaching the area, we saw trucks and cars crowded on the road south of the river alike fallen dominoes.\nAdvertisement Cars were on top of each other, says Jesús Lucero Ezquerro, as he discovered the damage left by the storm in Valencia. Courtesy of Jesús Lucero Ezquerro The streets were full of dirt, covered with mud and water. People to the south of the river had no power or signal. It was like going back to the Middle Ages.\nWe also helped a group of young people clear a sidewalk. We were up to our eyebrows in mud.\nThe police were there, but there were hardly any other emergency services in the area, as they were rescuing people who were at risk.\nFriends have lost their cars. Some have garages full of water and mud that they are cleaning. I don't know anyone close to me who died.\nAdvertisement We returned home in a state of shock, taking it all in.\nJesús Lucero Ezquerro said he and his friends helped clear the streets of Valencia. Courtesy of Jesús Lucero Ezquerro Left behind I am frustrated and angry.\nRelated stories I have a background in marine environmental emergencies and forest fire management, and I now work for a company on a firebreak management and forest fire prevention project.\nSo, I'm not a firefighter or a member of the military, but I've worked on environmental emergencies from an intelligence-gathering point of view.\nAdvertisement I know how to evacuate people, how to manage populations, and how to manage adverse situations. But that did not happen in Valencia.\nWorse than Hurricane Milton I remember watching the news of Hurricane Milton hitting Florida last month and how Floridians were preparing for it.\nResidents boarded up their windows with large wooden panels; store owners were getting ready for it, and people evacuated.\nThe Tampa mayor even urged people to leave and said that anyone who stayed would die.\nAdvertisement After Hurricane Milton, there were at least 16 deaths. Meanwhile, here in Valencia, it's already about 10 times as many.\nThe Spanish Meteorological Agency had issued an alert days before the storm. But on Tuesday, nothing happened. There was absolute calm in the morning. People were going to work and to university. When the local alerts came, the storm was already happening.\nA wake-up call Undoubtedly, human errors were made. I've never seen anything like it.\nIn a country like Spain, with the means, agencies, and intelligence we have, it is horrible that this happened.\nAdvertisement At a certain point, authorities were saying 50 dead, then 60, then 70, then 90. To me, that doesn't sound like much. I believe that when the waters recede and the mud clears, more dead bodies will be found.\nRead next as told to Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

    "text": "By Miranda Devine, Steve Janoski ,\n53 minutes ago\nRacist graffiti that prompted an elite New Jersey private school to close its doors for a day this week was revealed as a sickening verse, The Post has learned.\nThe writing — revealed in a Wednesday email from Dwight-Englewood School head Jeremy Gregersen that was sent to parents and obtained by The Post — was four lines of prose that said, “I will kill everyone / blacks and Spanish / and much more / sons of b—-es.”\n“While I know that such language can be alarming, I am sharing it with you for the sake of full transparency,” Gergersen wrote in the email. “We continue to work closely with law enforcement to find the person responsible for this message.”\nDwight-Englewood School in Englewood, New Jersey, said hateful, threatening graffiti were discovered on campus Monday night. Google maps The targeted threat — made in a school where about half the 1,015 students are people of color — was so worrisome that the ritzy private school 12 miles north of Midtown Manhattan shut down Wednesday.\nWhen it reopened, it had both uniformed and plainclothes security officers patrolling the halls, Gregersen added in the email.\nElite NJ private school closes after ‘threatening’ racist graffiti found in bathroom\n“These measures are planned on an interim basis and will be adjusted in accordance with developing facts and in partnership with law enforcement,” the school head wrote, adding that the Englewood Police Department is “in full support” of the reopening plan.\nThe hateful, menacing words were found Monday evening in a boys’ bathroom near the library, Gregersen said in an earlier email to parents.\nIt was quickly scrubbed away, then reported to law enforcement. But the school remained shuttered while cops and administrators investigated the bias incident.\nDwight-Englewood School officials revealed what was written in an email to parents. Facebook / Dwight-Englewood School To restore educational excellence, end the government’s monopoly on schools\n“While we are confident the community can return to school safely, we are nonetheless delaying school by an additional day our return from our Passover holiday so we may continue the investigation and prepare for a thoughtful and reassuring return,” a Wednesday statement from a school spokesperson said.\nThe Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office referred requests for comment to the Englewood Police Department this week.\nThe Englewood department has not responded to those requests.\nDwight-Englewood School canceled all classes and extracurricular activities on Wednesday. Dwight-Englewood School It’s not the first racism scandal the school has dealt with involving its student body. Early last month, Gregersen notified parents about a group text between several middle schoolers that included racist jokes and other offensive language, according to the Record newspaper.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER\nThe text chain included more than 30 seventh-grade boys, including Gregersen’s own son, the newspaper said.\nIn Wednesday’s email, Gregersen said several faculty members have met with law enforcement to try to nail down the identity of the mean-spirited artist. He also asked that anyone with helpful information reach out to school administrators.\nMeanwhile, cops are reviewing campus security footage from that evening, Gregersen has said.\nThe school head added that the staff will “do what we can to return swiftly to a sense of normalcy.”\n“I am sorry that this event has occurred on our campus,” he wrote. “Such disruptions are never easy, and I have been gratified by the generous, thoughtful, and caring response of our community.\n“Thank you for your support and understanding in this difficult moment.”\nFor the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
