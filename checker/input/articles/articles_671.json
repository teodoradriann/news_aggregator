El incidente ocurrió el 22 de diciembre.\nDurante la audiencia de hoy, la Fiscalía explicó que la agresión tuvo lugar después de una pelea entre la pareja. En consecuencia, el hombre habría atacado repetidamente a la mujer con un objeto cortopunzante, provocándole la muerte.\nDespués de cometer el crimen, el patrullero agresor se habría dado a la fuga con sus pertenencias. Sin embargo, se dio a conocer que esta no fue la única vez en la que el uniformado habría maltratado a su pareja. Se reveló que la patrullera Celis contaba con una medida de protección y había solicitado su traslado dentro de la policía debido al temor por su vida. Sin embargo, esta solicitud no se había llevado a cabo, ya que estaba en proceso administrativo\nEl presunto feminicida, mientras cometía el crimen, tomaba el teléfono celular de la víctima y respondía a los mensajes de texto enviados por la familia de la mujer. Este acto se interpreta como un intento de desviar la atención de las personas interesadas en conocer el paradero de la patrullera.",

    "title": "Investment in green hydrogen is growing, but regulatory changes still needed to meet targets",
    "text": "Investment in green hydrogen is growing, but regulatory changes still needed to meet targets The International Energy Agency's latest report on green hydrogen reveals that the sector will need to grow at 90% per year until 2030 to meet its targets The International Energy Agency has just published its [Global Hydrogen Review 2024](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/3ece5ee4-7537-4992-8ba6-b83c994c3fd4/GlobalHydrogenReview2024.pdf) report, in which it takes a snapshot of the sector over the past year and sets out its growth forecasts for the future, as well as analysing the projects that are in the pipeline. Hydrogen demand Global demand for hydrogen reached 97 million tonnes in 2023, an increase of 2.5% over the previous year. By 2024, the agency's projections point to a demand of 100 million tonnes. This growth is driven more by the growth of economies than by the implementation of policies to support this energy. Most of this growing demand is concentrated in the chemical and refining sectors, and is mainly met by hydrogen produced from mitigated fossil fuels. As in previous years, hydrogen produced by low-emission means (so-called green hydrogen) played a marginal role, with production below 1 million tonnes in 2023, despite growing by 10% year-on-year. However, the International Energy Agency is optimistic that hydrogen produced by non-carbon generating sources could reach 49 million tonnes per year by 2030, thanks to the new projects that are being announced, mostly electrolysis-based projects. Regional distribution The distribution of demand by region remained virtually unchanged from 2022, with China as the world's largest consumer of hydrogen, accounting for almost a third of global demand (28 million tonnes). China's consumption is double that of the second largest consumer, the United States, whose demand was 13 million tonnes, accounting for 14% of global demand for the year. Demand grew moderately in all regions except the Middle East, where it grew at a higher rate (more than 6% year-on-year), due to increased demand in the refining and methanol production sectors, and in India, where growth exceeded 5% due to demand in the refining and steel production sectors. New projects According to the International Energy Agency report, both investment and the number of green hydrogen generation projects are growing, ‘although policies to stimulate demand in key sectors such as heavy industry, refining and long-haul transport are needed to accelerate deployment’. The sector faces a number of obstacles, including regulatory uncertainty, persistent cost pressures and a lack of incentives to accelerate demand from potential consumers. The report finds that the number of projects that have reached a final investment decision has doubled in the last 12 months, which would mean a five-fold increase in current global green hydrogen production by 2030. If all projects were to be realised, global production could reach 50 million tonnes per year by the end of this decade. But this would require the hydrogen sector to grow at a rate of more than 90% per year from 2024 to 2030, which would represent even higher growth than solar photovoltaics at its peak. China dominates the market Of the more than 6 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity approved for investment in 2023, China accounts for more than 40%. The Asian country dominates the electrolyser market, with more than 60% of global manufacturing capacity and a capacity of 25 gigawatts per year, well above the global average. However, according to the report, both installed electrolyser capacity and green hydrogen volumes remain low, ‘as developers wait for clarity on government support before making investments. Uncertainty around demand and regulatory frameworks means that most potential production is still in the planning or early development phase, with some larger projects facing delays or cancellations due to these hurdles, along with permitting or operational issues,’ the IEA notes. According to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, ‘the increase in new projects suggests strong investor interest in developing green hydrogen production, which could play a key role in reducing emissions from industrial sectors such as steel, refining and chemicals. But for these projects to succeed, low-emission hydrogen producers need buyers. Policy makers and developers need to look carefully at tools to support demand creation, while reducing costs and ensuring that clear regulations are in place to support new investments in the sector. Morocco, well positioned Among the green hydrogen distribution projects, [Morocco and Nigeria](https://www.atalayar.com/articulo/economia-y-empresas/nueva-inversion-gasoducto-marruecos-nigeria-podria-acelerar-construccion/20230525150253185407.html) have launched a 5,600-kilometre hydrogen pipeline that will link the two countries and run along the West African coast, passing through 11 countries: Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania. This new hydrogen pipeline will run parallel to a gas pipeline and its objective will be to transfer the hydrogen produced in Africa for export to European countries, with Morocco as a departure point. The cost of the project is around 25 billion dollars, which will be covered 50-50 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNCP) and the Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Minerals (ONHYM), according to the director general of this organisation, Amina Benkhadra, who announced last September. Production vs. demand The report also highlights the gap between production and demand targets: while production targets set by governments around the world amount to 43 million tonnes per year by 2030, demand targets amount to just 11 million tonnes over the same period, i.e. a quarter. This has forced governments to implement a range of policies to stimulate demand for green hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. However, according to the report, the progress made so far in the hydrogen sector is not sufficient to meet climate targets. Recommendations Finally, the report contains a series of recommendations to governments to improve the prospects for green hydrogen adoption and meet the proposed targets: - Accelerate demand creation for green hydrogen by leveraging industrial clusters and public procurement. - Support project developers to increase green hydrogen production and drive cost reductions. - Strengthen regulation and certification of the environmental attributes of green hydrogen. - Identify opportunities to start developing hydrogen infrastructure. - Support emerging markets and developing economies to expand the production and use of low-emission hydrogen.",

    "text": "( New York Jewish Week ) – Two stores in a shopping plaza in Scarsdale, north of New York City, were vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti on Wednesday evening.\nThe phrase “Genocide supporters” was scrawled in black paint across the front window of an ice cream and gift shop known as Scoop Shop , photos from the scene showed, with the store’s brightly colored pillows and stuffed animals visible in the store’s interior. A clothing store called Cheryl’s Closet in the same plaza, the Golden Horseshoe Shopping Mall, was vandalized with the same message.\nScoop shop owner Adam Deutsch, who is Jewish, said he believes the store was targeted due to a sign saying “We stand with Israel” that has been in the store’s window for a few months.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Scoop Shop (@scoopshopscarsdale)\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day I accept the JTA Privacy Policy .\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\nSome pro-Palestinian groups in New York City have urged followers to boycott businesses with ties to Israel , but Deutsch said he had not heard that activists were targeting his store before the vandalism, which occurred overnight and was discovered Thursday morning.\n“This was a shock to me when I woke up this morning,” he told the New York Jewish Week by phone.\nHe believes the shop was targeted due to the pro-Israel sign, not because of his Jewish identity. “What they wrote seemed like it was because of the sign, not because of me, but who knows,” he said.\nCheryl’s Closet, an upscale women’s boutique, is also believed to have Jewish owners , ABC 7 New York reports. When reached by the New York Jewish Week, an employee at the store said she was unable to comment on the incident.\nThe shopping mall is also home to a kosher supermarket, Seasons, which was not defaced.\nThere was no permanent damage to the stores and the graffiti has been removed. Scarsdale Mayor Justin Arest and the Westchester County District Attorney Miriam E. Rocah have visited the shopping plaza, which is across the street from the Jewish Community Center of Mid-Westchester.\nA rally by local Israel supporters is planned at the mall for 4 p.m. Thursday, Deutsch said.\nCollins Coyne of the New Rochelle police department said detectives had visited the stores and were investigating. “No one was injured, there’s no damage but it’s obviously very hurtful to the community,” he said. The mall is located on the border of New Rochelle and Scarsdale and falls within the New Rochelle police department’s jurisdiction.\nSupport the New York Jewish Week Our nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York.\nDonate The area’s congressional representative, Jamaal Bowman, who has come under fire for criticism of Israel in recent months, condemned the incident , as did his challenger in next year’s primary, George Latimer . Latimer will attend the rally on Thursday afternoon, CBS reported.\nThe city of New Rochelle said it was “deeply saddened and disturbed” by the incidents.”\n“We stand by our Jewish citizens and will not tolerate these types of attacks,” the city said in a statement.\nAntisemitism has spiked in New York City since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel , according to NYPD data, although comparable, up-to-date data is not available for the rest of New York State. Jewish groups have reported a surge in antisemitism nationally and online since the terror attack, when Hamas killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 others hostage.\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul, citing the spike in hate since Oct. 7, said in a Thursday statement that she was proposing $60 million in new funding for groups at risk of hate crimes, and adding dozens of new offenses that could qualify as hate crimes, including graffiti.\nShare this: Twitter Facebook WhatsApp Email",

    "title": "Volkswagen workers to go on strike in Germany from Monday: Union",
    "text": "Workers at German factories of carmaker Volkswagen, which has been plagued with crisis lately, are set to go on strike from Monday over plans to cut thousands of jobs, union IG Metall said. \"If need be, it will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen,\" the union said on Sunday. The crisis-wracked auto-titan has been locked in bitter talks with unions since announcing in September that it was mulling the unprecedented step of shuttering plants in Germany, where it has some 120,000 employees. VW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles, and tough competition in China, a key market. Ahead of talks last month, the union and VW's works councils put forward a series of proposals they said would save 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in labor costs without the need for site closures. These included proposals for management and staff to waive bonuses. The union also said it could drop a demand for pay raises in exchange for working shorter hours at some factories. But Volkswagen said it had concluded that, while the measures could help in the short term, they would not lead \"to any long-term financial relief for the company in the coming years.\" IG Metall at the time described VW's response as \"extremely regrettable,\" accusing it of \"ignoring the constructive proposals of the employee representatives.\"",

    "text": "The United Arab Emirates has signed an agreement with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to allocate US$5 million to support the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF). The agreement was signed on behalf of the UAE by Sultan Al Shamsi, Assistant Minister for International Development Affairs, and on behalf of OCHA, Edem Wosornu, Director of the Operations and Advocacy Division, at a special ceremony in New York at the UAE Mission to the UN, and in the presence of Lana Nusseibeh, Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths said, “We are deeply grateful to the Government and the people of the United Arab Emirates for your generous support of $70 million to help bring relief to the people of Sudan through the United Nations. With this allocation, we can bolster our lifesaving support to families and communities caught up in Sudan's unprecedented humanitarian crisis.” The UAE contribution to the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, managed by OCHA, will facilitate access to funds to address the most critical humanitarian needs and emergencies on the ground, in line with the annual Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Nusseibeh said, “The UAE’s long-term support to Sudan is a testament to our dedication to fostering a prosperous Sudan and promoting stability in the region. We are pleased to partner with OCHA and other UN agencies to deliver vital aid to those most impacted.” She added, “I reiterate the UAE’s unwavering position is to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, and a peaceful solution to the crisis. There is no military solution to this war - the parties to the conflict must return to the negotiating table. To that end, the UAE will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders and support any process that aims to set Sudan on a political path to reach a lasting settlement and achieve a national consensus for forming a government where civilians participate and lead.” The UAE contribution to OCHA is part of a broader commitment of $70 million dedicated to addressing urgent humanitarian needs in Sudan, through UN agencies and humanitarian organisations. This funding is a substantial portion of the $100 million pledge made by the UAE in April at the ‘International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries’. This contribution takes the total amount of UAE aid to Sudan in the past 10 years to more than $3.5 billion. The UAE underscores that the priority is to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian facilities and to facilitate humanitarian assistance through multiple routes into the country and across conflict lines, provide humanitarian support, and ensure the delivery of aid to those in need, especially to the most vulnerable.
