    "title": "Tom Emmer backs bill to kick Gary Gensler out of SEC",
    "text": "U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer, the Majority Whip, has thrown his weight behind a bill that aims to remove Chairman Gary Gensler from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Emmer, known for his outspoken stance on financial regulation, is co-leading the SEC Stabilization Bill alongside Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. This legislative effort signals a growing discontent among lawmakers regarding Gensler’s leadership at the SEC. Emmer’s Critique: “SEC Sides with Wall Street, not Main Street” In a fiery statement, Congressman Emmer criticized Gensler’s tenure at the SEC, accusing the regulatory body of siding with Wall Street interests over those of Main Street. Emmer has been a vocal advocate for the cryptocurrency industry and has consistently clashed with Gensler over the SEC’s approach to regulating digital assets. Emmer previously described Gensler as “ineffective as he is incompetent,” emphasizing his belief that Gensler is not the right leader for the SEC in the rapidly evolving financial landscape. Emmer is not alone in his concerns about Gensler’s leadership. Congressman Davidson, also a co-sponsor of the bill, expressed his belief that 2024 would be an opportune time to remove Chairman Gensler from his position. He went so far as to label the SEC as “corrupt,” highlighting a broader sentiment among lawmakers critical of the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency regulations. Gensler’s Controversial Stance on Crypto One of the primary points of contention revolves around Gensler’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Critics argue that the SEC, under his leadership, has not demonstrated impartiality in its decision-making regarding digital assets. This includes delays in approving [Spot Bitcoin ETF](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-etf-approval-secs-battle/) applications and the overall regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Gensler’s leadership has also faced scrutiny for what some perceive as an “outsized influence” in shaping financial regulations. Congressman Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York, questioned Gensler’s role, describing him as a “politician masquerading as a regulator.” Torres, a supporter of the cryptocurrency industry, believes that Gensler’s authority over crypto needs to be reevaluated, particularly concerning “investment contracts.” Congressman Steven Horsford from Nevada voiced concerns about the potential negative impact of Gensler’s rulemaking on small businesses. He emphasized the need for regulations to adapt to the dynamic nature of the economy and cautioned against overly aggressive regulatory approaches that could disproportionately affect minority communities and specific industries. Biden Administration Officials Express Concerns Even within the Democratic camp, concerns about Gensler’s regulatory agenda have surfaced. Biden administration officials, including Michael Hsu, the acting comptroller of the currency, and Michael Barr, the vice chair for supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, have expressed reservations about proposed changes to the SEC’s Custody Rule. These changes could significantly affect financial institutions and bank balance sheets. In November, Representative Wiley Nickel of North Carolina emphasized the importance of Congress playing a role in regulator decisions, including those of the SEC. He urged regulators to consider a more balanced and industry-friendly approach rather than relying solely on enforcement measures. To address these concerns, Emmer and Davidson introduced the SEC Stabilization Act earlier this year. This bill seeks to restructure the SEC, reducing the chair’s power and adding an additional commissioner to the commission. It also establishes an executive director position to oversee daily operations, aiming to rebalance decision-making within the regulatory body. As the debate over Chairman SEC’s leadership continues to escalate, the future of the SEC remains uncertain. Emmer and Davidson’s bill adds fuel to the fire, highlighting the growing discontent among lawmakers over the direction of financial regulation in the United States. Whether this legislative effort gains traction and leads to Gensler’s removal will be closely watched by both critics and supporters of his tenure at the SEC.",

    "title": "New Florida Human Trafficking Strike Team cracking down on border-related crime",
    "text": "By By Bethany Blankley | The Center Square contributor ,\n1 hour ago\n(The Center Square) – A new multi-agency human trafficking strike team has been created in Florida to target border-related crime. As the result of a recent months-long operation, 10 victims were rescued, and several alleged perpetrators were arrested.\nAttorney General Ashley Moody announced the creation of the new strike team with law enforcement leaders on Thursday.\n“Human trafficking is a challenge for every state,” AG Moody said, “because, under this president, we have absolutely no enforcement at the southwest border. People are … giving monies to transnational criminal organizations to bring them straight into this country; then they find themselves at the mercy of the same organization.\n“Because we have our own government pushing as many people as they can into the interior,” enforcing the law “falls on the shoulders of these folks standing behind me to make sure that we are rescuing those that are being taken advantage of,” she said.\nThe investigation began in October 2023 in Manatee County after the sheriff’s office acted on a search warrant and turned over information to Homeland Security Investigations and the strike team, FDLE Special Agent in Charge Mark Brutnell said.\nInvestigators identified businesses that were commercial fronts for sex trafficking operations in Manatee and Hillsborough counties, where alleged ringleader Lina Payne recruited women from Columbia and allegedly held them hostage in Florida. She then allegedly forced them to have sex to pay off their debt to bring them into the country under threat of violence.\n“What we found was a fully functional, highly organized international human trafficking operation” based in Hillsborough and Manatee counties, Brutnell said. Payne was allegedly making frequent international trips to Latin American countries where the victims were living and were later trafficked through the border into Florida, he said.\nThe victims had no accessible modes of transportation, their identification documents were taken from them, their food was delivered to them, theywere forced to live inside massage parlors, barber shops and other businesses, where they could not leave, he said.\nPayne’s alleged accomplices, her boyfriend, Sebastian Jurado, and her son, Andres Payne, were involved in recruiting women from Venezuela and Colombia who agreed to pay between $40,000 and $50,000 to be smuggled across the southwest border into the U.S., according to the investigation. Lina Payne allegedly promised them legitimate work, but once they arrived, they were held hostage.\nAt one point during the investigation, it appeared Lina Payne was attempting to flee the country and was arrested at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport. Not soon after, her boyfriend and son were arrested in Tampa. Another alleged trafficker remains at large. Each defendant faces multiple felony charges and is being prosecuted by AG Moody’s Office of Statewide Prosecution.\nThrough the course of the investigation, the strike team rescued 10 victims. They also believe they identified more than 117 victims of Payne’s trafficking operation over years.\nPasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the victims “were brought here to Florida and had no idea what hell they were being brought into. We’re talking about human lives. If someone was drowning, we’d go out and save them. These are people who are lost out at sea, in hell, living in captivity. We are going to rescue them.”\nWhile he said he was glad they caught the traffickers, he said, “there are a lot of evil people who pay to have forced sex, rape, with these women.”\nOne way to break the cycle of sex trafficking was to enhance criminal penalties “against people who are buying and forcing sex on and raping women.” Another is to create a civil penalty to enable victims “to easily sue” their abusers, he said. “If we take away the livelihoods of the people buying and forcing sex on victims, take their houses, cars, … it will set a tone. Just like everything else we do in Florida, we will protect people.”\nAG Moody said, “Biden’s border crisis is emboldening transnational criminal organizations, and as a result, we are seeing horrific human trafficking cases right here in Florida. The disturbing facts of this case highlight the need for our new statewide Strike Team, and demonstrate how this expert team of investigators, prosecutors, analysts, and victims’ advocates can help coordinate efforts to take down trafficking operations and rescue victims.”\nThe new strike team is providing intelligence, guidance and support to law enforcement agencies statewide and is also coordinating emergency victim support services. The team works directly with Florida’s new statewide human trafficking tip line, 855-FLA-SAFE.\nIt’s currently assisting local law enforcement efforts with more than 20 human trafficking cases and making contact with nearly 40 victims—including the 10 victims from this investigation, Moody said.\nAlso joining Moody in making the announcement were Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Mark Glass, Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office Colonel Chris Rule, Manatee County Sheriff’s Office Major Todd Shears and Homeland Security Investigations Tampa Special Agent in Charge John Condon.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Winds: NE 5-15 mph.\nTonight: Mostly clear becoming partly to mostly cloudy. Lows: 64-73. Winds: E 5-10 mph.\nSaturday: Partly to mostly sunny with the chance of a few showers / storms especially across southern Delmarva. Highs: 84-90. Winds: SE-S 5-20+ mph.\nSaturday Night: It becomes mostly clear. Lows: 64-73. Winds: S 5-10 mph.\nSunday: Partly to mostly sunny. I can’t rule out a stray shower or storm, but most will be dry. Highs: 82-90. Winds: S 5-15 mph.\nMonday: Partly to mostly sunny with the chance of a few pop-up showers / storms. Highs: 84-90. Winds: S-SW 5-15 mph.\nA refreshing air mass will arrive just in time for the start of the Delaware State Fair with temperatures this afternoon into the 80s for highs with lower humidity levels. We will get to enjoy a good amount of sunshine throughout the day. It will also be much cooler toward the beach towns thanks to the wind off the Atlantic. As we move into Friday night and Saturday, the wind will continue to turn more out of the south and allow for a bit more humidity to start to creep in across the area.\nThis shift back toward more humid air will have temperatures jumping into the 80s to near 90 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. The chance of showers or storms will be around through the early part of Saturday as the warm front tries to sneak back across Delmarva. The threat of a shower or storm looks to be confined to the southern part of the Peninsula, but we can’t rule it out farther north either. Sunday is the pick of the weekend with more sunshine and temperatures in the 80s for highs.\nWe enter next week with an unsettled weather pattern with temperatures in the 80s and the 90s with a chance of a few showers and storms possible each day over the course of the week. It is not going to be a total washout and most of us will be dry over the course of next week, but we can’t rule out that storm chance for most of next week.",

    "text": "Aunque por un momento se pensÃ³ que el fuerte calor que enfrenta la ciudad de Cali fue la causa de los problemas del cantante neoyorquino, sus explicaciones aclararon lo ocurrido. Willie ColÃ³n se ausentÃ³ durante 20 minutos y prende las alarmas en Cali ColÃ³n estuvo ausente durante 20 minutos frente a una audiencia de 25 mil personas en el superconcierto de la Feria de Cali. Los espectadores quedaron desconcertados despuÃ©s de que el artista exhibiera seÃ±ales de malestar en el pecho y la garganta. No obstante, es importante seÃ±alar que se encuentra en buen estado de salud.\nNo dejes de leer\nEmmanuel Restrepo se mostrÃ³ muy feliz tras cumplir sueÃ±o en plena grabaciÃ³n Â¡Imperdible! Rigoberto UrÃ¡n y actores de Rigo se le midieron a cantar â€™Hijo de Urraoâ€™ El salsero al regresar al escenario indicÃ³ que tuvo una molestia en su garganta y el pecho, regresÃ¡ndole asÃ­ la tranquilidad a los integrantes del evento.\nAsÃ­ mismo Pietro Carlos Correa , el representante del cantante, compartiÃ³ con un medio nacional que el artista experimentÃ³ molestias durante el concierto debido al calor intenso en el estadio. Sin embargo, asegurÃ³ que amaneciÃ³ en buen estado de salud y que tiene planeado regresar a su paÃ­s este jueves.\nEl cantante Willie ColÃ³n se apartÃ³ por unos minutos de la tarima del Superconcierto debido a un problema de salud, sin embargo regresÃ³ y continÃºo su show.

Aunque aÃºn no se han realizado declaraciones pÃºblicas sobre el incidente, es evidente que la situaciÃ³n no pasÃ³ a mayores, pues a pesar del contratiempo, el artista, a sus 73 aÃ±os continÃºa exhibiendo su potente voz, bailando y hasta tocando su trompeta.\nSin embargo, este incidente no empaÃ±Ã³ la distinguida reputaciÃ³n del Superconcierto, que perdura como un pilar fundamental de la identidad cultural de Cali y una exhibiciÃ³n destacada del talento y la historia de la salsa.\nSuperLike ya estÃ¡ en WhatsApp Channels!

    "text": "Xóchitl Gálvez , precandidata presidencial por el PAN, PRI y PRD, calificó como “carísima y absurda” la llamada megafarmacia que anunció el presidente López Obrador y dijo que lo que se requiere es que las medicinas lleguen a 190 mil comunidades del país. Descalificó la política de salud implementada por el Gobierno Federal, quien dijo, pretende distribuir al interior de la República todos los días en avión y helicóptero medicamentos almacenados en la megafarmacia, ubicada en el Estado de México.\nLa aspirante de Fuerza y Corazón por México cuestionó: \"¿cómo va a llegar un medicamento de urgencia desde Huehuetoca, Estado de México, hasta un enfermo en Tijuana, Mérida o en la montaña de Guerrero?\".\nLee también: AMLO asegura que “superfarmacia” contará con medicinas y entrará en operación “mañana mismo”\n“La idea de una megafarmacia puede no sonar mal, pero eso de mandar medicamentos todos los días en avión y helicóptero es carísimo y absurdo. México no necesita la megafarmacia más grande del mundo. Lo que necesita es que haya medicinas en cada una de sus 190 mil localidades”, expuso en un video difundido en sus redes sociales.\nGálvez pidió al Presidente de la República no jugar con la salud del pueblo, principalmente de la gente más pobre. “No se trata de política, se trata de vidas humanas”, expresó.\nConsideró que los mexicanos que viven en pobreza no podrán salir adelante si cada vez que enferma un familiar gastan un dineral en medicinas. Por ello, cuestionó al Presidente si de verdad para él son primero los pobres.\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nrmlgv",

    "text": "Plow operators are not the only ones keeping busy with the massive amount of snow that Mother Nature has dumped on Sault Ste. Marie.\nJoe Della-Savia, owner of Inside Out Contracting, said his crew has been working steady since the nasty weather arrived in late November.\nDella-Savia said the last time he saw this much snow so early on was in 1995, when the city had over 67 inches of snowfall over five days.\n“That was the year Station Mall collapsed,\" he said.\nAlthough officials with the City of Sault Ste. Marie are reluctant to declare this an emergency, Della-Savia said it definitely is one.\n“Right now the city is crippled. We really need to work together and people have to be lenient on where we put the snow.\n\"We only offer emergency services - for excessive buildup. We do roofs, reshape driveways and cut down snowbanks. We have the equipment and the knowledge,\" he said, adding that they've been in business for 18 years.\nThis year, neighbours have yelled at his crew if they put snow on their lawn or over their fence.\nDella-Savia said he hasn’t heard of any residential roofs that have collapsed, but he’s seen collapsed gazebos, lean-tos, metal storage buildings and more.\n“Every day I see one that’s collapsed,” he said.\n“I’m hoping not to see any homes. Buildings that are flat with low slopes are really vulnerable. Modern day-constructed buildings . . . they’re safer but it’s not a guarantee.”\nDemand has been overwhelming, he said. They’ve had 40 jobs since this started three weeks ago.\n“People ask me if they have three to five feet of snow on their roof, should they be concerned? They’ve answered their own question. They are concerned . . . and they definitely should be.”\nDella-Savia said people should check their insurance policies to see if they are covered if their roof collapses.\n“They think they’re covered but most are not covered,” he said.\nRon Frolich, the receptionist at RM Frolich Roof Systems, confirmed they’ve also been swamped.\n“We’ve been averaging 20 to 30 phone calls per day,” he said.\nInside Out Contracting has a Facebook page or can be reached at [705-971-3471](tel:705-971-3471).\nRM Frolich Roof Systems can be reached at [(705) 256-2320](tel:(705) 256-2320) and is also on Facebook.",
