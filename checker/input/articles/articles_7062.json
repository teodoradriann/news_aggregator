    "text": "Carcassa di tartaruga marina a Marciana Marina, ottimo lavoro dell’Ufficio locale marittimo e Capitaneria di Porto\nIl 17 luglio l’ufficio Locale Marittimo di Marciana Marina ha segnalato alla sala operativa della Capitaneria di Porto di Portoferraio l’avvistamento della carcassa di un grosso esemplare di tartaruga marina Caretta Caretta alla spiaggia della Fenicia a Marciana Marina, e, come da protocollo, è stata allertata l’ARPAT che, in base alle foto inviate dalla Capitaneria, ha detto che l’esemplare non era di interesse scientifico a causa dell’avanzato stato di decomposizione.\nSuccessivamente l’Ufficio locale marittimo di Marciana Marina ha sollecitato l’ufficio tecnico del Comune di Marciana Marina a provvedere allo smaltimento della carcassa, ma la prima data utile per consentire alla ditta specializzata di Livorno di intervenire sembra essere il 22 luglio.\nIntanto a Legambiente stanno arrivando numerose segnalazioni sulla carcassa di tartaruga che - . giustamente – è stata assicurata a una boa esterna al Porto per consentirne il prelievo senza interferenze (anche igienico-sanitarie) con il traffico e lo stazionamento portuale.\nLegambiente Arcipelago Toscano ringrazia il Circolo della Vela di Marciana Marina per l’assistenza fornita ed evidenzia l’ottimo lavoro svolto dall’Ufficio Locale Marittimo e dalla Capitaneria di porto e sollecita il Comune di Marciana Marina a rimuovere al più presto la carcassa. Inoltre, episodi pur tristi come questi sono l’occasione per realizzare una rete intercomunale che diminuisca i tempi di intervento per il recupero delle carcasse di tartarughe e cetacei, anche in ottemperanza alla Carta del Santuario Pelagos recentemente sottoscritta dal comune di Marciana Marina e dalle altre amministrazioni comunali elbane.",

Make big changes at the right time… and it’s not now GAA chiefs on high alert as forecast cold snap threatens to cause fixture disruption Ireland was left under a blanket of white this morning as the cold spell struck with many areas experiencing a severe frost.\nThe polar spell will see snowfalls over the weekend but the coldest weather is likely to strike between next Monday and Wednesday.\nDisruption is expected at some sporting events over the weekend given the impact of the snow and freezing temperatures on ground conditions.\nTemperatures will struggle to rise above freezing in many areas between Monday and Wednesday.\nMet Éireann's Joanna Donnelly warned that there was the potential for significant accumulations of snow in some areas, most likely in the midlands and on higher ground.\n\"This is expected to be a multi-hazard weather event,\" she said. \"Disruption will be due either to the accumulations of snow or, in areas where snow doesn't fall, the sleet and rain that falls.\n\"In those very cold conditions, the rain is going to freeze and that is going to create icy stretches and potentially treacherous conditions for travel,\" she added.\nIrish councils confirmed that stocks of road salt and grit have been replenished for the treatment of all Priority One and Priority Two roads nationwide.\nUisce Éireann and councils are also preparing for any possible disruption caused by the freezing weather to water pipes.\nAll national and major secondary roads have been treated for icy conditions since last Wednesday and council crews will treat the roads daily during the Arctic spell of weather.\nA surfer on Marble Hill Strand beach near Dunfanaghy, Co Donegal yesterday. Photo: PA\nNews in 90 Seconds - January 03 2025\nHowever, there are fears that if the worst of the Siberian weather hits Ireland, it will result in widespread travel disruption early next week.\nBoth gardaí and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) urged people to travel with extreme care.\nTemperatures will sink to minus 5C this weekend but could plummet to minus 10C between Monday and Tuesday making it a potentially chaotic return to work and the classroom for thousands of people after the Christmas holidays.\nAll Irish primary and secondary schools are scheduled to reopen on Monday for 960,000 students.\nA decision on whether to remain closed or to delay reopening times will be a matter for individual school management boards around the country in light of local weather conditions.\nOne government source said that key to any advice offered to schools will be a safety assessment for the operation of the school bus transport fleet between Monday and Wednesday.\nMet Éireann forecaster Gerry Murphy said there would be sleet and snow in many areas on Saturday evening and into Sunday.\n“It will most likely fall as rain down the south coast but it must be said that the amounts of rain expected in the south and south-west are quite high, so it’s likely that we will see rainfall warnings, at least, in the south-west of the country,” Mr Murphy told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.\n“Then, as that rain pushes up through the afternoon/evening, it turns more to sleet, as you go in the hours of darkness then turning more to snow – currently, it looks like – predominantly over the southern half of the country.\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint but really as we go through tomorrow night into Sunday all areas can expect sleet or snow at some stage.”\nNext Tuesday will see the peak of the Arctic conditions as overnight temperatures potentially sink to a frigid minus 10C.\nNorthern Ireland is also expected to receive snowfalls over the weekend.\nElderly support groups including Age Action have urged people to check on the old, ill and vulnerable in their communities in advance of the Siberian conditions.\nPeople have been asked to check that the vulnerable have access to heating, warm food and drinks as well as proper clothing.\nHomeless support charities have also put in place plans to offer emergency shelter to rough sleepers.\nAgencies dealing with international protection applicants and refugees are also monitoring the Arctic weather forecast to ensure everyone is protected from the worst of the conditions.\nFarming and animal welfare groups have urged all livestock owners to check that animals have sufficient access to fodder and water given the likely impact of snow and ice.\nTwins Ava (left) and Mia Clarke (8) slide down a hill in a park at Portglenone Marina, near Ballymena.

    "text": "Hizbullah Deputy Secretary-General Sheikh Naim Qassem saluted American pro-Gaza protesters in a May 3, 2024 interview with Al-Manar TV [Hizbullah-Lebanon]. He said that Hizbullah appreciates and values them very much, and that the protests will have a great impact on the U.S. elections and will influence President Biden's policies. He also said that this might impact the extent of the support America provides for Israel, which in turn can bring upon the destruction of Israel without much effort on the part of Hizbullah.

Below is the transcript of the MEMRI TV clip of Naim Qassem's statements. \"The Israelis And Americans Have Laid The Foundation For The Perpetual Resistance Of Children And Fetuses, [Starting] At An Earlier Age\" Naim Qassem: \"The Israelis and the Americans will discover that with this type of aggression, they have laid the foundation for perpetual resistance of children and fetuses, at an earlier age than the age fighters became qualified in the past. In the past, they started to think of joining the fray once coming of age, but now they are determined to enter the battlefield as soon as they are born, having seen their parents being killed, the genocide perpetrated by Israel, and the global crimes committed by America against them. SUPPORT OUR WORK [...] \"The [Campus Protests] Are Important, Especially Because They Will Have An Impact On U.S. Elections\" \"The Americans – especially Biden – are under great pressure. Biden is under internal and external pressure because of his policy and approach. The pressure within America is more significant. He is at risk of losing the elections because of Gaza. [...] \"When we say America is an oppressor, that America must be stopped, that America is hypocritical, and so on and so forth – we mean the American administration. We are saying 'America' for short. We cannot keep saying the 'American administration' all the time. No. We say 'America' and we mean the American administration. \"As for the American people, I judge them according to their actions. When the American people take a stand in support of Gaza – or rather, those among them who take a stand in support of Gaza – we salute and applaud them, and we believe that they are standing for justice against the occupation. \"We appreciate and value this very much. Perhaps in the future, there will be cooperation among the youth of the world – in America, France, Britain, Germany, and all the activists. The [campus protests] are important, especially because they will have an impact on the U.S. elections. They will have an impact on the American position. Even if Biden says that he will not be influenced by this, he will whether he likes it or not. We will see him taking actions because of the protesters' influence on him. \"Without [U.S.] Support, Israel Is Nothing; We Will Not Have To Work Hard To Destroy It\" \"As long as the Muslims, the Arabs, and the free people cannot form a lobby that will be stronger than the Zionist lobby, this 'popular lobby' can play a role in changing the point of view and this is more important than the [political] lobby above. Where do the members of Congress come from? From among the people. If the people's perspective changes... There were never such level [of protests] in America... This would mean embarking on a new stage, and maybe one of these days, America will no longer support Israel to such an extent. Without support, Israel is nothing. We would not have to work hard in order to destroy Israel. Without support, it will be destroyed.\"",
