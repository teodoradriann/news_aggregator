    "text": "Americans Optimistic About Future Social Security Benefits Gallup poll that shows that Americans are feeling more upbeat about future social security benefits, relative to recent years More Americans expect to receive Social Security when they retire, according to a recent Gallup [survey](https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx). Yet, 43% of retirees currently expect that their benefits will eventually be cut. The new poll also found that expectations for receiving Social Security benefits vary by age among nonretirees, with 66% of those 50 and older expecting to get benefits. Only 37% of nonretirees between 30 and 49 believe they will get Social Security benefits, while 61% do not. Of the youngest adults, aged 18 to 29, 50% think they will get benefits (up from 34% in 2015), and 48% do not. That’s the most optimistic this age group has been at any point since 2000. Gallup noted that preserving Social Security largely called on raising payroll taxes of current workers, curbing benefits for current and/or future recipients and possibly raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits (currently 67 years old). And while U.S. adults have typically favored raising Social Security taxes rather than curbing benefits to sustain the system long-term, they are more likely to favor tax increases now than in the past.

Uncertainty About Maximizing Social Security Benefits The survey showed that only 8% of respondents understood [how to maximize their Social Security benefits](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security). For example, only 13% of respondents correctly guessed their full retirement age based on their birth year. On average, they said it was 60 years of age. Generation Z and millennials thought the retirement age was 54 and 55, respectively. Also, nearly half (49%) of adults also incorrectly believed that if they filed for Social Security early, their benefits would automatically increase once they reached their full retirement age. Changes for 2024 According to [Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/social-security-changes-in-new-year), on January 1, several 2024 Social Security changes are going into effect, which will impact outline how to maximize benefits and what beneficiaries will receive and how they will qualify. - The Cost of Living Adjustment [(](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024) [COLA](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024) [)](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024)for 2024 is 3.2%. That means recipients will see their monthly payments rise by that amount for the new year. On average, that equals more than $50 per month, per the SSA. - Wealthy taxpayers may see higher taxes in the new year, as the [Social Security tax wage base](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/social-security-tax-wage-base-jumps)in 2024 rises by 5.2%. - In 2024, you can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. However, you are entitled to full benefits when you reach your full retirement age (FRA). - If you are below the FRA and still earning an income from working while collecting Social Security, the SSA will withhold $1 for every $2 above a set amount, which is [$22,320](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/rtea.html)in 2024.

    "text": "Lam Dong – The Ministry of Transport and the People’s Committee of the Central Highlands province of Lam Dong on June 23 held a ceremony to announce Lien Khuong airport as an international one, the first of its kind in the Central Highlands region.Speaking at the ceremony, Deputy Transport Minister Le Anh Tuan said that the airport’s runway, which is 3,250 metres long and 45 metres wide, can handle the Code D plane like the Airbus A300, the Boeing B757, and equivalents.Accordingly, it serves regular and irregular international and domestic trips, private aircraft, military aircraft and other licensed types.Direct flights from the airport to many countries will create favourable conditions for transporting international tourists as well as goods, vegetables, flowers, and agricultural products from the Central Highlands to many other countries at the lowest costs and the shortest time.Nguyen Ngoc Phuc, Vice Chairman of the Lam Dong provincial People's Committee emphasised that the Lien Khuong international airport will create very favourable conditions for local socio-economic development in particular and the Central Highlands region in general, especially for the tourism sector as Da Lat is becoming an attractive destination for international tourists.Construction on Lien Khuong airport, originally named Lien Khang, was started in 1933. It is about 39km from Da Lat city’s downtown. After many upgrades and expansions, the airport now welcomes over 2 million passengers on average each year. Over the past several years, the transport ministry has allowed Lien Khuong to operate many irregular international flights transporting tourists to the province although it is a domestic airport.According to the province’s planning until 2030, the Lien Khuong international airport will meet criteria of an 4E level airport with an area of 340.8 ha and a designated capacity of 5 million passengers per year. By 2050, it is expected to expand to 486,8 ha and host 7 million passengers yearly. Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) has directed the Airports Corporation of Vietnam (ACV) to address proposals from the Hoa Lu consortium related to the Long Thanh International Airport terminal package 5.10, according to Tuoitre. On August 25, Long Thanh People’s Committee organised a ceremony to hand over ground-phase 1 for the construction of Long Thanh International Airport and the two road routes connecting the T1 and T2 terminals, to investors.",

    "title": "'Lost my US dream...': Tech engineer's viral post on social media triggers heated debate on US education gamble",
    "text": "Armed with dreams and degrees, a growing number of Indian students land in the United States each year, banking on advanced education to unlock lucrative careers. But for many, the American dream stalls soon after graduation. An unforgiving job market, limited H-1B visa opportunities, and a lack of sponsorships leave them grappling with tough choices — settle for less, return home, or risk career stagnation.\nPointing to this widening gap between aspiration and reality, a Reddit user shared, “I have 3 years of work experience and was working at TCS until 2023. That year, I took a sabbatical to pursue a Master’s in the US, aiming to find a job here. I completed my degree in 1.5 years and have been job hunting for the past 6 months — but haven’t had any success due to the tough market.”\nThe user added, “Now, I’m considering returning to India and continuing with TCS. But the new bench policy — where employees on bench for more than 35 days may be let go — has made me anxious. With the current high bench count, I’m worried I might not get a project in time, and risk losing that job too. It feels like I might end up losing both — my US dream and my position at TCS. I’m really confused and would appreciate any guidance or suggestions.”\nThe post triggered a wave of reactions online.\n“You did MS from practically tier 3 colleges in the US that are there just to pull money from desperate Indian international students like you... Don’t go to the US unless you're getting into an Ivy League or other top 30 college,” wrote one user, adding that small firms may offer initial opportunities even if they don’t sponsor green cards.\nAnother user encouraged perseverance: “Do job hunting till last mile... you have little luck going to the US, this will affect generations together and f*** TCS — there (are) hell lot of companies for 3 yr experience if you are good at some tech.”\nA third emphasized upskilling: “Focus on skills. With current competition... try to be full stack as much as possible and try to learn the way to implement LLMs and related frameworks like Langchain etc. Even if you don't get a job in the US, you should get a good paid job in India.”\nDespite their different tones, the responses underscore a common reality: a US degree, once seen as a ticket to prosperity, now demands a more strategic, skill-driven approach — both abroad and back home.",
