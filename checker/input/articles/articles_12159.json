If yes, can you explain what that practically means? Do they really conduct military operations from schools and hospitals and residential buildings? If yes, why?\n- Does Hamas have a \"pay for slay\" program, in which they pay Hamas terrorists for killing (or taking hostage) innocent Israelis?\n- Can you explain what those who have been brought up in the west fail to understand about the mindset and culture of those in Hamas? Why do so many in the west support it, and do you think they actually know/understand what they're supporting?\n- Is Israel illegally occupying Gaza and The West Bank?\n- Is Israel truly an apartheid state?\n- Is Israel trying to commit a genocide against Palestinians?\n- Does Israel have the right to exist?\n- What is the resolution to all of this? Is a two-state solution possible (or even desirable)?\n- What can us regular people do to improve the world and lead us toward peace?\nYou can get your copy of Son of Hamas here ► ⁠https://amzn.to/47ZslNw",

    "text": "Texas zoo delivers baby gorilla via rare emergency C-section A Texas zoo delivered a critically endangered baby gorilla via an emergency cesarian section, the first time in the zoo’s history. Related: [Walnut, a white-naped crane with a Smithsonian zookeeper as a mate, dies at age 42](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/02/walnut-white-naped-crane-dies-age-42-smithsonian-national-zoo) Baby Jameela, a western lowland gorilla, was delivered by a team of medical experts on 5 January at the Fort Worth Zoo, [the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article285480477.html). Jameela’s mother, a 33-year-old gorilla named Sekani, was supposed to give birth naturally in early to mid February. But Sekani quickly developed symptoms of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication seen in humans and primates that causes high blood pressure. Fearing for Sekani and her baby’s health, the zoo’s veterinary team decided that Sekani would have to deliver her baby early via C-section. “Following testing that supported this diagnosis, we determined that intervention was necessary to save Sekani and to give her unborn baby the best chance for survival,” said John Griffioen, the zoo’s assistant director of animal programs and conservation, during a press conference, the Star-Telegram reported. Zookeepers at Fort Worth quickly sought help from human gynecology experts, as the reproductive systems of primates and humans are nearly identical. Dr Jamie Walker Erwin, a Fort Worth-based obstetrician and gynecologist, was tapped to help with Sekani’s birth. Erwin has previously worked as an OB-GYN consultant for the zoo, helping with a range of concerns related to the reproductive health of primates. Erwin helped bring together a team to deliver baby Jameela, including an anesthesiologist and a neonatologist, the Star-Telegram reported. Both mother and daughter were in good health, despite the complicated procedure. Erwin told the Guardian that aiding with the delivery was “amazing” and a “highlight” of her career. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Erwin said. “I usually operate on people,” she added, with a laugh. Since the procedure, zoo keepers have been providing care to Jameela as Sekani recovers from surgery. Unfortunately, Sekani has not shown interest in being reunited with baby Jameela. But Fort Worth zoo keepers said they are in the process of training another female gorilla, a 24-year-old named Gracie, to act as Jameela’s surrogate mother, [WFAA reported](https://www.wfaa.com/article/life/animals/fort-worth-zoo-premature-gorilla-born-jameela/287-a7e7ac1c-d409-4bee-828f-2f67865a826e). “Zookeepers are hopeful Gracie will be an ideal surrogate mother, exhibiting maternal behaviors that will be necessary for the baby to thrive: holding and carrying of the infant, protection, cooperation with zookeepers during feeding time, and teaching the little one necessary social skills she needs to be a gorilla,” a Fort Worth zoo spokesperson said in a press release. Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered because of hunting and disease among the species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, [CBS News reported](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/fort-worth-zoo-welcomes-baby-gorilla-via-emergency-c-section/).",

    "text": "Carlos Alcaraz is “a thousand miles away” from matching Rafael Nadal’s mental toughness in a scathing verdict delivered after his Australian Open quarter-final defeat last week.\nWorld No 3 Alcaraz was beaten 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 by Novak Djokovic in Melbourne, pushing back his quest to complete the Career Grand Slam until at least 2026.\nDjokovic was struggling physically during the match and, despite his win, eventually retired due to a hamstring injury in his semi-final versus Alexander Zverev.\nIn the aftermath of his defeat, Alcaraz was criticised by some for failing to take advantage of his opponent’s obvious struggles.\nThe latest to do so is Italian tennis great Paolo Bertolucci, speaking on Sky Sports Italia .\nBertolucci, a former world No 12 and a Davis Cup champion, claimed that Alcaraz should have won the match – and was lacking the mental toughness of his idol Nadal.\n“Alcaraz is sleeveless like Nadal, he plays differently, but he is a thousand miles away from Rafa in his head,” said Bertolucci.\n“He should have gone 2-1 in the match with Nole and probably would have brought the match home.”\nAdding to Bertolucci’s criticism of Alcaraz was Adriano Panatta.\nThe former world No 4 and 1976 French Open champion said that Alcaraz “must be at a level” where he can no longer lose to Djokovic at Grand Slam level.\nTennis News Jimmy Connors makes feelings clear on Novak Djokovic and reveals why he is ‘rooting’ for the Serb\nPatrick Mouratoglou issues bold verdict on Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz debate as he ‘disagrees with everyone’\n“Mentally he [Djokovic] crushes anyone, the other one took the bait with all his boots,” added Panatta. “Novak is a great champion, phenomenal, nice or unpleasant, it’s subjective.\n“But even a set tied, with Djokovic, he can no longer lose. He can no longer afford to lose against Novak. He was defeated in Paris two out of three but it was something special, a final on clay at the Olympics.\n“Three out of five, Alcaraz must be at a level that he should no longer be beaten by Nole.”\nAlcaraz has won both of his Grand Slam finals against Djokovic, beating the Serbian in back-to-back Wimbledon finals in 2023 and 2024.\nDjokovic got the better of the Spaniard at the French Open in 2023 and now their most recent meeting in Melbourne, meaning they hold two wins apiece in their head-to-head at majors.\nHowever, Djokovic now holds a 5-3 advantage in their rivalry, having triumphed in both their Olympic gold medal match and their Australian Open contest following Alcaraz’s SW19 triumph last July.\nAlcaraz was looking to become the youngest man in tennis history to complete the Career Grand Slam in Melbourne, though is still yet to make it past the quarter-final stage at the Australian Open.\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion would still become the youngest-ever player to win all four majors should he triumph in 2026 or 2027.\nRead Next : The 6 men to reach world No 2 but not win a Grand Slam: ft.
