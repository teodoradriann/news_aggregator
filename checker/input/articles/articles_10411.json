    "title": "Watch this Maine hummingbird shower in the rain",
    "text": "By Pete Warner ,\n5 hours ago Editor’s note: This story was originally published in June 2023.\nLinda Theriault-Quirion enjoys immersing herself in nature. She goes out for a walk every day, even during the winter.\nAs a diehard outdoor enthusiast, she has developed a keen sense of awareness about things going on around her.\nThose skills paid tremendous dividends — and without her even leaving her home in Presque Isle — in August 2022.\nIt was pouring rain outside, which provided a backyard visitor with the opportunity to get cleaned up.\n“I happened to be walking by the window in the kitchen and that caught my eye and I was like, oh my God, that is too cute,” Theriault-Quirion said.\nOn a tree branch, a hummingbird was fluttering its wings and aiming its pointed beak toward the sky while enjoying the chance to take a shower. It was a sight she had never seen before.\nTheriault-Quirion pulled out her phone and began taking video of the episode, which she has been kind enough to share with Bangor Daily News readers.\n“I have seen them before in the lilac bush because the hummingbird feeders are hanging close to the bush,” she said. “That one was particularly cute.”\nTheriault-Quirion said the bird in the video is a female ruby-throated hummingbird, which does not have the iridescent red throat feathers found in males. She’s accustomed to seeing many different species visiting their feeders.\n“We get purple finches, house finches, yellow finches. We get the grosbeaks, you name it,” she said, noting that an indigo bunting is the most striking of the birds that have visited.\n“I was just mesmerized by it,” she said.\nPhotography is a favorite hobby for Theriault-Quirion, who enjoys taking pictures of sunsets, sunrises and the moon. Her walks through the woods produce plenty of photo subjects.\n“I’m always on the lookout for something different,” she said. “People will ask me, where did you take this picture, and most of them are done right at Mantle Lake here.”\nTherault-Quirion, who for nearly 11 years has been retired from her job in the Aroostook County district attorney’s office, admits she isn’t a particularly patient person. However, her forays looking for wildlife, and other beautiful elements of the outdoors, with her camera have improved her ability to slow down and enjoy the view.\n“This has taught me some patience,” she said.\nTheriault-Quirion is thrilled to be able to share her photos and videos on Facebook, because she knows everyone doesn’t have the same opportunity.\n“People will message me and say, I used to be able to do that and I appreciate so much that you’re sharing these videos and these pictures,’” she said.\nToday, we are all benefiting from her efforts.\nDo you have an outdoors photo or video to share? Send it to pwarner@bangordailynews.com and tell us, “I consent to the BDN using my photo/video.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Flooding: Retirement home in the district of Gifhorn evacuated, people in Meppen rescued with tractor - Teller Report",
    "text": "In parts of Germany, people are still struggling with the effects of the continuous rain. Lower Saxony, which has been severely affected, has asked the Bundeswehr for support. The water level measured on Friday morning continued to exceed the highest alert level in many areas. Fears of a storm surge have not yet been confirmed, said state fire director Dieter Rohrberg. The flood situation varies from region to region, and no all-clear can yet be given for the whole of Lower Saxony. Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) said that the focus of the floods had shifted from the southeast to the northwest of the country in recent days with the water masses. A retirement and nursing home in Müden (Aller) in the district of Gifhorn has been evacuated because water has penetrated the house. 13 residents were taken out of the home, said Horst Kraemer, head of the Gifhorn district association of the German Red Cross (DRK). On Thursday, volunteers from the German Red Cross and the volunteer fire brigade had already accommodated around 20 residents in other retirement homes. In Meppen (Emsland), five people were rescued from a house surrounded by water with the help of a tractor. Initially, the fire department tried to rescue the people from the house with a boat, said a spokesman for the fire department. A farmer was finally able to drive his trekker through the water and use the trailer to get the trapped people out of the house. According to the report, the farmer was on site because he was transporting sandbags for security and offered his help. Appeal for voluntary renunciation of firecrackers A ban on firecrackers has been issued in some flood regions – for example in parts of Bremen and the municipality of Lilienthal in the district of Osterholz. Environment Minister Christian Meyer (Greens) appealed for a renunciation of New Year's Eve firecrackers in the areas affected by the floods. As a result, fewer missions could be required for the heavily stressed forces. The district of Osterholz fears that many onlookers will be out and about in the flood area on New Year's Eve. \"Please be considerate of the people and their belongings in the affected area and do not enter these areas,\" appealed District Administrator Bernd Lütjen (SPD). The work of the emergency services should not be made even more difficult. \"There are plenty of other ways to go for a walk on New Year's Eve weekend in our county.\" Animals are also still threatened due to the flooding. With an emergency plan, Serengeti Park Hodenhagen is preparing for further evacuations of animals. Of particular concern is the house of antelopes and giraffes, which is surrounded by water, said a spokeswoman for the zoo. \"These animals would have to be anesthetized for evacuation, which is a big risk.\" In several regions of Brandenburg, the flood situation has calmed down. According to the State Environment Agency, only light precipitation is expected until New Year's Day. On the Lusatian rivers such as the Neisse and the Black Elster, the all-clear was given. Elbe near Wittenberge continues to rise The Spree, on the other hand, remains under observation, it said. At individual gauges, there could be short-term but uncritical exceedances of the guideline values of alert level 1. For the flood wave in the Oder, no aggravation is to be expected for Ratzdorf and Eisenhüttenstadt. However, the water level of the Elbe in Wittenberge in the district of Prignitz is likely to rise further. On Saturday, alert level 2 of a total of four levels will therefore be declared, the State Office for the Environment announced. The city made preparations for a swelling of the flood water and has a guard service on hand to check on the dike. The authorities do not expect the situation to develop dramatically. The water level at the Wittenberge gauge on Friday afternoon was 5.20 metres. According to the forecast of the State Environment Agency, the water level should not exceed 6 meters until New Year's Day. Rivers had previously burst their banks, especially in the foreland of the dike. Farmers had to take their animals from the meadows. The Nedwighafen on the banks of the Elbe in Wittenberge, where caravans are usually located, was flooded with mud and water. The flooding on the Elbe also affected the construction work on the new A14 bridge between Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Due to the risk of flooding, construction workers had to move some office containers to safety. Circus is allowed to stay The city of Dresden in Saxony has lifted alert level 3 due to the Elbe flooding. Alert level 1 is now expected to apply until January 2, the administration announced. Originally, it had been predicted that the Elbe would reach a water level of six meters and more. This is the threshold for the second highest alert level 3. On Thursday, however, only a high of 5.95 meters was reached, since then the water has been sinking again. In the meantime, the Dresden Christmas circus, which is standing in a flume, is allowed to stay. The city had ordered the eviction because the circus had not voluntarily dismantled its tents. In view of the slight easing of flooding, an evacuation would now be disproportionate, said Eva Jähnigen, head of the environmental department. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the Ministry of the Environment is not giving the all-clear despite stagnating or falling water levels. \"We still have a major flood situation,\" said Environment Minister Oliver Krischer (Greens). So far, the consequences have remained manageable, no victims to mourn. There was no threat of dam failures or uncontrolled overflows at the dams. The flood protection systems would have held. However, the dikes have softened in many places. It had become clear that there was a need for renovation. bbr/dpa/AFP",

Ya me mandó un WhatsApp: ‘Negro, trae la guitarra’”, aseguró en el extracto de la conversación con Julio César Rodríguez.\nSostuvo que el quiere “morir sin dar pena, no quiero dar lastima” y señaló que considera que este ”no es un mal momento para partir”.\nPosteriormente, a través de un mensaje publicado en su cuenta de Instagram, Miguel Piñera confesó: «Queridos amigas y amigos. Como ya sabrán estoy muy delicado de salud. Este año no ha sido fácil, partió mi hermano el pasado 06 de febrero».\n“Gracias a Dios durante estos meses he tenido el honor de recorrer mi Chile lindo y querido, cantando y haciéndole un humilde homenaje a mi hermano Sebastián. Se vienen tiempos difíciles. Solamente quiero agradecer todo el cariño del mundo que me han dado durante mis 50 años de trayectoria musical. El honor de haberme presentado antes ustedes ha sido mío. Abrazos, gracias Chile y arriba los corazones”, cerró el músico .",

Sin embargo, los últimos contratiempos con los [cohetes Falcon 9 de SpaceX](https://www.mundiario.com/articulo/tecnologia-ciencia/paralizados-nuevamente-cohetes-elon-musk-que-pasando-spacex/20241003050842319609.html), previstos para este lanzamiento, han generado cierta incertidumbre. Tras el fallo de la segunda etapa del Falcon 9 en el lanzamiento de la misión[ Crew-9](https://www.mundiario.com/articulo/tecnologia-ciencia/nave-espacial-starliner-regresa-tierra-tripulantes/20240910012909317451.html) para llevar astronautas a la Estación Espacial Internacional (ISS), SpaceX tuvo que suspender temporalmente sus actividades de despegue mientras se investiga la causa del problema. A pesar de esta pausa, la ESA se mantiene optimista respecto a la ventana de lanzamiento, que se extiende desde el 7 hasta el 27 de octubre. Hera es la primera misión de defensa planetaria de la ESA. Su objetivo es realizar un estudio detallado del impacto de la nave DART en el sistema binario de asteroides compuesto por Didymos y Dimorphos. Este último, con un diámetro de 150 metros, fue el primer objeto del sistema solar cuya órbita fue alterada por la intervención humana, después de que la nave DART chocara contra él en 2022. El impacto de la misión DART logró modificar la órbita de Dimorphos alrededor de Didymos en unos 30 minutos, marcando un hito en las pruebas de desvío de asteroides. La misión Hera, que llegará a su destino a finales de 2026, tiene como propósito principal recoger datos cruciales para determinar la efectividad de la técnica de desviación cinética. Además, permitirá comprender mejor las características físicas y estructurales de los asteroides, información vital para desarrollar futuras estrategias de defensa planetaria. La tecnología avanzada sus cubesats Para alcanzar su destino en el sistema binario Didymos-Dimorphos, Hera realizará una maniobra gravitacional en Marte en 2025. Esta técnica permitirá a la nave adquirir la velocidad necesaria para llegar a su objetivo. Una vez allí, los científicos de la ESA esperan obtener datos precisos sobre el cráter dejado por la nave DART, así como información sobre la composición interna y la masa de Dimorphos. Según Michael Kueppers, científico de la ESA, esta información es esencial para evaluar la eficiencia del impacto y mejorar los modelos de impacto de asteroides. Hera contará con el apoyo de dos pequeños satélites, llamados cubesats, que desplegará durante su misión. El primero, Milani, se encargará de realizar análisis espectrales de la superficie del asteroide, mientras que Juventas llevará a cabo los primeros sondeos de radar en un asteroide, proporcionando datos sin precedentes sobre la estructura interna de Dimorphos. Estos cubesats, del tamaño de una caja de zapatos, jugarán un papel crucial en la misión, ya que ofrecerán una visión más detallada de las características del asteroide tras el impacto. Uno de los objetivos principales de la misión Hera es validar o ajustar los modelos de impacto a escala de asteroides. Los datos recopilados permitirán a los científicos verificar si la [técnica de desviación](https://www.mundiario.com/articulo/tecnologia-ciencia/sonda-dart-desvio-asteroide-primera-mision-defensa-planetaria-es-exito/20221011210800253836.html) empleada por DART es efectiva y cómo podría mejorarse. Según los expertos, la información que proporcione Hera podría ser clave para preparar a la humanidad ante la posibilidad de un impacto futuro de un asteroide de tamaño considerable. El sistema binario Didymos-Dimorphos es representativo de los miles de asteroides que orbitan cerca de la Tierra y que podrían representar un riesgo en el futuro. De hecho, un asteroide de unos 150 metros, conocido como “asesino de ciudades”, podría destruir una ciudad entera en caso de colisión, aunque no tendría el tamaño suficiente para causar un impacto a nivel planetario. Esto subraya la importancia de la misión Hera en el desarrollo de una defensa efectiva contra estas amenazas potenciales. Colaboración internacional y participación española La misión Hera ha sido posible gracias a la colaboración internacional, con 18 países europeos y Japón involucrados en su desarrollo. El proyecto, que cuenta con un presupuesto de 363 millones de euros, ha sido liderado por la compañía OHB en Alemania, mientras que varias empresas españolas han jugado un papel fundamental en su éxito. La compañía GMV ha liderado el desarrollo del sistema de guiado, navegación y control de la nave, y EMXYS ha contribuido a la electrónica del gravímetro GRASS de Juventas. Además, SENER ha fabricado las antenas de baja ganancia y Thales Alenia Space Spain ha diseñado subsistemas de comunicación para la misión. La misión Hera no solo representa un avance tecnológico y científico, sino también un paso crucial hacia la protección del planeta Tierra frente a futuros impactos de asteroides. Con el lanzamiento previsto para este mes de octubre, todos los ojos están puestos en la ventana de despegue y en el éxito de esta ambiciosa misión de defensa planetaria. @mundiario",
