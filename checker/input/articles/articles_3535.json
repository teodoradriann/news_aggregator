    "text": "It's weird to be a grown-up orphan. It forced my siblings and I to reckon with faith Two years ago, my dad was in the ICU at a hospital in Salt Lake City. He'd been transferred there from a hospital in my hometown of Idaho Falls, Idaho, because his ruptured aorta demanded more experienced surgeons. My brother and sister and I flew in to be with him, but after a few days, the signs were trending positively, and he looked at us and deadpanned, \"What are you still doing here? I'm fine! Go!\" So we all kissed him on the cheek and flew back to our respective homes. He died a couple weeks later. Our dad, Stephen, was the parent who was supposed to stick around for a while. It's not like he was young. He was 74. That's a pretty good life. But he was in such good shape. He lifted weights most days and had no serious health issues, and so when he died it felt like we had been robbed again. Our mom, Linda, died of cancer in 2009. She was just 60 years old. She died before I met my husband. She never got to meet our kids. It felt very much like a life interrupted, cut way too short by a disease that made no sense in a woman who was such a life force herself. I had convinced myself that because God, or the universe or whatever, had taken away Mom so early, we were definitely going to get to hang out with Dad until he was shuffling around his house like the old man he was supposed to become. It didn't work out that way. Being a grown-up orphan is weird. I know I'm supposed to focus on how lucky I was to have my parents for as long as I did. But I still feel ripped off when my 9-year-old gets a hit in his little league game and I want to call my dad and give him the play-by-play. Or when my 11-year-old busts out in a song and dance in the kitchen, and I so desperately want to send a video to my mom because she would just love it – and him – so much. But it's deeper than that. After my dad died I felt an existential void. He and my mom both had rich and textured spiritual lives. With both of them gone, I realized I had never built that for myself. And I was consumed with questions about whether I had to in order to lead a meaningful, happy life. Last spring, I set out to try to answer that question by [talking to a lot of different people](https://www.npr.org/series/1175750522/enlighten-me-with-rachel-martin) who were swimming around in the same murky existential waters, but had emerged with some kind of clarity. One of the first conversations I recorded for this series was with my siblings, Abigail and Paul. I wanted to ask them direct questions about what they believe and how that did, or did not, help them navigate their own grief. We put that conversation in the vault for a while because it was so personal. But now, during the holidays, it feels OK to let it out into the world. I'm not in the same emotional place as I was eight months ago. I'm far more comfortable in my not-knowing-ness. I am finding meaning in my work and my community and my family in new ways. I don't feel empty anymore. But this conversation captures where I was at a particular point in time – my brother and sister too. And a level of honesty I don't think the three of us had shared before. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Rachel: My first question, I mean, I know the answer to these questions, some of them, but can each of you try to define Mom and Dad's spirituality? Abigail: Dad always seemed very pragmatic about spirituality. Like, he was all about scripture. Not that he was taking scripture literally, but he was really steadfast in what he believed. And yes, he would be open to conversations and challenges, but Mom morphed. When we were young, I didn't perceive Mom as this like hardcore Christian. Rachel: She was a dabbler. Abigail: Yeah. Past lives... Rachel: Right! Reincarnation, some meditation. Abigail: And then when she got sick, everything changed. And she became more in line with what Dad believed. Paul: I agree that Dad had maybe a more rigid view. He came from the Presbyterian tradition and Baptist before that. He had studied all of these other religions, but he studied them at arm's length. Whereas when Mom studied the other religions, she was open to the possibility that there were shared values, shared connections and philosophies that connected her spirituality to people of other faiths. Rachel: Yeah. Like when Dad would study other stuff, it was more like an intellectual exercise. Whereas Mom was studying with a practitioner's eye and heart. Like maybe she was going to incorporate that stuff into her own faith. Paul: Yeah. Rachel: So do you believe in God? Paul: I do. Yeah. I don't believe in a God in the sky pointing his finger like on the Sistine Chapel. I think the death of Mom and Dad made me go through a process of understanding, or made me think critically about what I do believe, you know, because it's no longer a theoretical thing. Of course I thought about it when we lost all our grandparents, but with Mom and Dad, that's every day you're thinking about, where are they, you know? What happened to them? So you have to process it differently. It did take some adaptation. I came to realize that when you think about what God is, it's a spark, it's the thing we all share that makes us unique. I think that resonates through a lot of different religions, and I think there's a lot of commonality to that concept. And so my belief of God is born of the Christian tradition, but certainly encompasses the idea that energy is special and it's in all of us and we all share it. Rachel: Do you think that it took Mom and Dad dying for you to be able to develop language around what you just said? To come to that conclusion about what God is to you? Paul: I think it was always there because we had been taught about other religions and other ideas. We'd never been told that other religions are wrong, that wasn't part of our upbringing. So it was that process of thinking critically about what I believed, and that was spurred by their deaths. Rachel: Abi, do you believe in God? Abigail: I did. I was so angry after Mom died. Towards the end, there was so much discussion about God and her faith and Dad's faith in the afterlife, and I still really struggle with understanding how someone so good could be taken from us. Going back to something that Paul was saying is that I believe in energy, because there are too many coincidences that occur for there not to be some power of some sort. I've had some really lovely happenstances with birds. And as we know, birds were Mom's thing. Rachel: She felt really connected to birds, seagulls in particular. Abigail: And so, I've had circumstances where I'm like, maybe there is a god. Maybe there is something. But I completely shut it down and cut it off when Mom died. And then when Dad died, it felt like we were going through the motions. Using the language that he had, what we grew up with, those traditions. Prayer is not something that happens in my life and sometimes I think I should pray because it's what we were taught we should do. But yeah, there's a lot of anger and sadness about it because I feel like I am missing something because I don't have that spirituality – I don't know if that's the right word. But God is not something that's present in my life. And I feel like there's a hole. Rachel: Yeah. I get that. Part of how I've been describing this, it's like Mom and Dad built this scaffolding, like spiritual scaffolding. They gave us the foundation, built like the exterior beams of what a spiritual life could look like. And then it was sort of up to us to build the rest of our spiritual home. And I feel like I never really got around to that part. Because they had such rich faith and strong religion, I felt like I didn't really have to do any of that work because it felt like it was there for me just whenever I needed a dose of it or something. I could retreat and I could take shelter in their faith. And then bail. So then when they died, I feel like all that's left is the scaffolding of it and it feels unsteady and empty. There's nothing there and I feel compelled to fill it up, but I'm not really sure how because the faith that we were raised in doesn't quite feel like it gives me everything that I'm looking for. Does any of that make sense to you or does any of that ring true to you? Abigail: Yes. Paul: Yeah, so the idea that we were beneficiaries or, like, the box was sort of checked by Mom and Dad, having that tent for us to be inside of, that resonates. You know, at some point it's up to you, cause it has to be a personal thing, right? It's abrupt for us to have a change when our home base is no longer there. But that doesn't mean it has to fulfill everything either. I also don't think it's bad or awful that we don't have our tent fully built out as soon as Mom and Dad are gone, because it's supposed to be an ongoing thing for our whole lives. And so we can always seek to work on our own tent. Rachel: Thank you for extending the metaphor. [laughs] Paul: It's a good metaphor. I like it. Rachel: Remember when Mom was sick, she started planting this idea in our minds that she was going to live in the wind, right? Which is why she gave us these beautiful wind chimes. And I've got mine hanging up and the wind will blow and I will think about her. And that's a useful story, you know, for thinking about what happens when the people we love aren't here anymore. That's what religion does in large part for people, it helps us make sense of that question. How have each of you thought about that? Do you believe in an afterlife? Paul: Well, you know, dust to dust. I think the energy goes back into the universe, like the law of thermodynamics. You can't create or destroy energy. So, like, I do believe in an afterlife, but I don't think it's one where we have a house and it's populated with all our dogs and friends and family and toys that we want and stuff like that. It's not something that we can really conceive of. I don't try to define what the afterlife is too much. I think there's limitations on our ability there. Rachel: Abi? Abigail: I want to. I want to believe that there's an afterlife. But the answer would be no. I think there's something. There's energy. What that is, I don't know, but it certainly is not that Mom is in heaven with Dad and our grandparents and they're having a dinner party. That logically doesn't make any sense to me. What about you? Rachel: Oh, me? I don't know. I think a lot of religious inquiry comes out of people trying to make sense of death and dying and the scariness of it and the uncertainty of it. And also parenting, explaining that stuff to your kids, you know? It's like, do I really tell them that there's, like, this place called heaven where Ima and Papa are? Paul: I mean, you think about whether people have gravesites or they are cremated and how we handle remains. A lot of that is for the survivors, right? And so you can help the survivors process the way they need to be able to do it. And I feel like, being the ones left behind, the concept of heaven or hell or an afterlife is one for the survivors again. And if we as a survivor need that, we have all of those memories and those things that our parents gave to us, which we're lucky to have, by the way. I mean, we had real lives with our parents. Rachel: Yeah. Paul: We can manifest them ourselves and have them with us when we want to. Rachel: I like that idea. Paul: We carry heaven in our pocket. Rachel: What? Did you just come up with that? Paul: I did. Abigail: That's good, Paul. Rachel: That's so good! Hurry, write it down! [laughs] Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Many believed Magomed Ankalaev would be the one to challenge Alex Pereira for the title. Instead, it was Khalil Rountree who received the opportunity but ultimately fell short, losing to Pereira at UFC 307. Following the fight, Pereira claimed that Ankalaev had turned down the matchup. Now, Ankalaev asserts that he has been paired with Aleksandr Rakic for UFC 308, and as he prepares for this bout, he has fired verbal jabs at Pereira.\nAnkalaev is set to take on Rakic, presenting a formidable challenge as he seeks to maintain his unbeaten streak since 2018 and solidify his status as the top contender in the UFC light heavyweight division. He believes the UFC placed Rakić in front of him to block his path to a fight with ‘Poatan.’ Nevertheless, Ankalaev is focused on securing the win to earn his desired title shot. At the UFC 308 press conference, he remarked,\n“We know that Rakic is a great fighter. I think the only reason the UFC put him in front of me is to defend their champion. So, we’re going to go across from him, we’re going to roll him over, and then we’re going to move onto the champ.”\nThe Russian fighter has his sights set on becoming the next world champion, but he must first overcome Rakić this weekend. Despite the criticism directed at him, UFC 308 main event fighter Max Holloway believes that Pereira has already secured the title of the best fighter of 2024.\nMax Holloway Claims Alex Pereira is a Lock for the 2024 Fighter of the Year Award\nAhead of his upcoming fight against Ilia Topuria for the featherweight title at UFC 308, Max Holloway, the current BMF champion discussed Alex Pereira’s impressive run in the UFC. In a recent interview with Kevin Iole on YouTube, Holloway labeled Pereira as the Fighter of the Year, recognizing their outstanding performances in 2024. He openly shared his insights on the light heavyweight champion, saying:\n“I mean I don’t know, man. I don’t know that I would do that. The way Alex took fights. I mean the fastest guy to defend his title, right, with three title defenses. That’s a hard man to beat. I mean every time I’m in the talks for it, somebody’s having a crazy a** year. I think Alex Pereira has got that win in the bag already.”\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral MMA stories via Google! Follow Us\nThe Brazilian fighter has nearly conquered all the top contenders in the light heavyweight division, with only Ankalaev remaining. However, a potential matchup between Pereira and Ankalaev hinges on the Russian defeating Rakić at UFC 308. If that happens, the future clash promises to be thrilling, and fans are likely eager for the fight.\nAlso Read: Khalil Rountree Chases 2025 Q1 Comeback Against Former Light Heavyweight Champion After UFC 307",

    "text": "El presidente de la Junta de Castilla y León, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, ha despedido 2023 con su tradicional mensaje de fin de año desde el IES María de Molina de Zamora, donde ha remarcado la intención del Ejecutivo autonómico por seguir fortaleciendo los servicios públicos de calidad y las medidas que conlleven progreso.\nUn buen ejemplo de lo que se ha conseguido hasta ahora es el reconocimiento a la calidad del sistema educativo de la Comunidad, como refleja el informe PISA, que confirma que la educación que se imparte en Castilla y León es la mejor de España y se sitúa entre las diez mejores del mundo. Un sistema educativo que siempre ha sido una prioridad para el Ejecutivo autonómico, tal y como ha destacado Fernández Mañueco, porque “es el mejor cimiento para que nuestros jóvenes escojan el futuro que quieran”.\nAsimismo, el presidente de la Junta ha señalado que, solo desde los principios y valores defendidos dentro del marco constitucional, Castilla y León puede seguir construyendo su futuro, de una manera pacífica y armónica, y avanzar para consolidar el protagonismo que ha conseguido hasta ahora. Para seguir impulsando servicios públicos con más y mejores prestaciones; con medidas de apoyo a las familias y la natalidad, como la gratuidad de la educación de 0 a 3 años; facilitando el acceso a la vivienda; y reforzando las destinadas a la lucha contra la violencia machista, ante la que no se va a dar un paso atrás.\nTambién, para mantener el liderazgo de la Comunidad en energías renovables con el objetivo de poder convertir su potencial en fuente de empleo y riqueza; o continuar estando a la vanguardia en innovación, aplicando para ello la tecnología en el territorio y adaptando todos los avances a los servicios públicos.\nTodo ello sustentado por una economía de futuro que defiende al empresario y a los trabajadores, apoya al emprendedor, y que sigue impulsando bajadas fiscales, la digitalización y la eficiencia de las industrias más pujantes de la Comunidad, como la agroalimentaria.\nFernández Mañueco ha destacado los avances sociales y económicos que se han producido y que han permitido que los ciudadanos de la Comunidad gocen de una mayor calidad de vida. Asimismo, ha tenido un recuerdo para las personas que han abandonado Castilla y León y ha señalado que una de las prioridades del Ejecutivo autonómico es favorecer su retorno.\nUnidad e igualdad en torno a la Constitución\nEn el año en el que se ha conmemorado el 40º Aniversario del Estatuto de Autonomía, Fernández Mañueco ha destacado los avances impulsados por la Junta de Castilla y León, que demuestran los beneficios que una buena gestión del modelo autonómico puede proporcionar, ofreciendo a las personas oportunidades de progreso y servicios públicos de calidad.\nEn su mensaje, Fernández Mañueco ha subrayado que estos 45 años de Constitución y los 40 años de Estatuto de Autonomía han demostrado que Castilla y León, y todo el conjunto de España, pueden fortalecerse y progresar a través de los principios y valores que recoge la Carta Magna, como son la unidad, la igualdad, la libertad y el equilibrio entre poderes. Por ello, y porque es la base de la democracia, ha reiterado la importancia que tiene defenderla, también como marco para garantizar recursos justos para todos, sin privilegios insolidarios ni intereses particulares.\nGracias a estos principios y valores, que Castilla y León asumió desde su origen, ha podido fortalecer su identidad, crecer en convivencia y lograr los grandes consensos políticos y sociales a través del diálogo, que han llevado a la Comunidad, tal y como ha destacado el presidente de la Junta, a avanzar dentro del modelo autonómico.",

    "text": "Arbeitskammer: Alarmierender Bildungsbericht für das Saarland\nDie Arbeitskammer des Saarlandes fordert die Landesregierung auf, mehr in Bildungseinrichtungen zu investieren. Ein aktueller Bericht der Kammer zeigt eine Reihe von Problemen. Die Situation sei alarmierend.\nAm Donnerstag hat die Arbeitskammer des Saarlandes den Jahresbericht „Bildungspolitik im Wandel“ präsentiert. Demnach sei die Situation im Saarland sei alarmierend, sowohl in den Kitas als auch in den Schulen. Schon in den Kitas würden nicht alle Familien, die einen Platz für ihre Kinder benötigen, auch einen bekommen. Besonders sozial benachteiligte und zugewanderte Familien seien davon betroffen.\nFachkräftemangel größtes Problem\nDas große Problem ist laut dem Vorstandsvorsitzenden der Arbeitskammer, Jörg Caspar, der Fachkräftemangel in der Einrichtungen. \"Ohne genügend qualifiziertes Personal stehen nicht nur weitere Platzkapazitäten auf dem Spiel, sondern auch die Qualität der pädagogischen Arbeit.\"\nEr fordert deshalb bessere Arbeitsbedingungen für Erzieher sowie attraktivere Ausbildungswege und eine stärkere gesellschaftliche Anerkennung des Berufs. Ansonsten riskiere man schon früh Bildungsungleichheiten, die schwer wieder aufzuholen seien.\nBezugnehmend auf den Bericht bestätigt die Gewerkschaft für Erziehung und Wissenschaft (GEW) das Problem. „Beginnend mit der frühkindlichen Bildung sehen wir bereits, dass aktuell eine Betreuungslücke von zehn Prozent herrscht. Laut Arbeitskammer fehlen also bis 2030 bis zu 4100 Fachkräfte“, so der Landesvorsitzende Max Hewer .\n\"Es mangelt an klarer Steuerung und Zielen\"\nAber auch an saarländischen Schulen gibt es laut des Bildungsberichts der Arbeitskammer Defizite. Rund jeder fünfte junge Erwachsene habe demnach keinen qualifizierenden Bildungsabschluss. \"Das ist ein Zustand, den wir nicht weiter hinnehmen dürfen\", so Caspar. Man müsse sich fragen, warum die gestiegenen Bildungsausgaben der letzten Jahre keine spürbare Qualitätsverbesserung bewirkt haben.\nEs mangele nicht an Programmen, sondern an klarer Steuerung und Zielen. Insgesamt müsse die die saarländische Bildungspolitik sozial gerechter gestaltet werden und die tatsächlichen Bedarfe der Menschen angehen.\nGEW fordert qualifiziertes Personal im gesamten Bildungsbereich\nDie GEW sieht auch im schulischen Bereich die Lösung in der Personalaufstockung: „Weitergehend müssten in Schulen mindestens 350 Lehrkräfte pro Jahr eingestellt werden, um den Status quo zu halten“, ergänzt Hewer.\nDie Regierung müsse den Fokus auf das Gewinnen und Halten von qualifiziertem Personal im gesamten Bildungsbereich setzen. Nur damit würden Lernsettings geschaffen, die für Kinder und Jugendliche förderlich sind und über eine reine Betreuung hinausgehen.\nÜber dieses Thema haben auch die SR info-Nachrichten im Radio am 26.06.2025 berichtet.\nMehr zu Schulen und Bildung im Saarland\nEinheitliche Hitzefrei-Regelung weiterhin nicht in Aussicht Gesetz zur digitalen Bildung an Saar-Schulen beschlossen Experten wollen mehr und bessere Gewaltprävention an Schulen Mehr Geld für Brennpunktschulen Frühkindliche Bildung: Zu wenig Kita-Fachkräfte im Saarland",

    "text": "Cold weather shelter providing welcoming warmth\nCold weather shelter providing welcoming warmth\nIf you’re in Fort Pierce and in need of a place to stay during the cold snap, an emergency warming shelter is available this weekend at Percy Peek Gym. The shelter is offering a warm place to stay and hot meals for those seeking refuge from the mid-40s temperatures on the Treasure Coast. Walk-ins are welcome, and the Treasure Coast Homeless Council will be providing long-term services to help people get back on their feet.\nTransforming the Gym into a Shelter\nAs the sun went down in Fort Pierce, Dominque Cain-Douglas with the “In the Image of Christ” nonprofit helped to transform the gym into a cold weather shelter. They are providing shelter, hot showers, breakfast, lunch, and dinner for those in need, making an effort to make people feel welcome and at home.\nThis is not just a shelter,” Cain-Douglas said. “We actually try our best to make people feel welcome, to make them feel at home and as we are a family.”",
