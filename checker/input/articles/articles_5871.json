On Wednesday, the strong winds brought down multiple trees on his property and damaging a wooden fence at the front of his home. “It sounded like a freight train coming down the road and then my garage door started shaking and I took off into the house.” Despite the damage, Jordan is grateful that there was no damage to the household itself and was able to joke about his neighborhood celebrity status. On the other side of Highway 35, Bobby Geers also showed high spirits when surveying the damage to his property. “It doesn’t look like the traditional ones you see up North though, you know, where they really touch down and scrape the ground real hard, but something came through here.” The tornado tossed a carport on Geers property from the ground, damaging an SUV. The strong winds also brought down several trees on his property as well. He also noted that he was shocked that a a tropical storm could bring down certain trees. \"They made it through Harvey. They didn’t make it through this.” For the latest local news updates, [click here](https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news), or download the [KRIS 6 News App.](https://www.kristv.com/about-us/kris-6-apps)",

    "text": "By Jim Thomas | Thursday, 28 December 2023 07:31 PM EST Ahmed Abou Hashima, founder and chair of MAFI Company for Agricultural Produce Industries, has disclosed plans for an agri-food industrial complex, poised to be the Middle East's largest. Valued at $300 million, the project is a collaborative effort with foreign investment. The signing ceremony was attended by dignitaries including Egypt's Prime Minister Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, Industry Minister Ahmed Samir Saleh, and Hossam Hibah, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones. The event was attended by global agri-food technology leaders. Situated in Sadat City Industrial Zone across 154,000 square meters (1,657,642 square feet) MAFI's complex comprises five cutting-edge plants. It includes Egypt's most extensive orange and tomato concentrate facilities, a pioneering cloudy product plant, and one of the world's largest freeze-drying facilities for fruits and vegetables. With an annual production capacity exceeding 100,000 tons in Phase I, the complex targets a turnover of $200 million. Phase II aims for a production capacity of 200,000 tons, translating to a $400 million turnover. Partners include JBT and Cabin Plant from the United States and GEA from Germany. Beltone Holding Co. conducted studies to ascertain financial viability, while BCG Co. analyzed market dynamics and trends. Hashima emphasized the complex's potential to generate over 7,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing to Egypt's economic growth. The project's vision includes exporting over 80% of its production, enhancing global market reach, and attracting foreign direct investment. Jim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

    "text": "NEW YORK, June 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of those who acquired Fastly, Inc. (“Fastly” or the “Company”) (NYSE: FSLY) securities during the period of February 15, 2024 to May 1, 2024, inclusive (“the Class Period”). Investors have until July 23, 2024 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. [Click here to learn more about the class action ] On May 1, 2024, Fastly announced its first quarter 2024 results. Despite the Company’s positive statements just weeks about its performance and near-term business prospects, Fastly reported revenue of only $133.52 million, missing consensus estimates by $0.35 million. The Company also lowered its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $555 million to $565 million, significantly below its previously issued FY 2024 revenue guidance of $580 million to $590 million, and likewise below consensus estimates of $584.62 million for the same period. That same day, Fastly held a conference call to discuss the Company’s Q1 2024 results. Fastly CEO Todd Nightingale attributed the Company’s disappointing results to “a reduction of revenue from a small number of [Fastly’s] largest customers.” Nightingale further reported that the Company saw “significant volatility” in the Content Delivery Network (CDN) strategy run by many of Fastly’s top 10 accounts. Further, Fastly’s CFO Ronald Kisling stated that the Company is “facing a challenging environment of revenue declines in our largest customers, overshadowing the impact of new customer acquisition and product pipeline[,]” and that the Company would not benefit in 2024 from the favorable impact of the early 2023 CDN consolidation that drove favorable sequential growth in the prior year same period. Then, on May 2, 2024, Bank of America downgraded Fastly stock from a “Buy” rating to an “Underperform” rating and cut its price target on the stock from $18 per share to a mere $8 per share, noting that “[d]ecelerating growth in Fastly’s largest customers, share loss in delivery, and limited visibility in 2H cause us to question a rebound in 2024.” On this news, the price of Fastly shares declined by $4.14 per share, or approximately 32.02%, from $12.93 per share on May 1, 2024 to close at $8.79 on May 2, 2024. The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Fastly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) contrary to its representations to investors, Fastly was in fact experiencing a significant deceleration in growth among its largest customers and was losing the increased market share it had gained as a result of the 2023 CDN consolidation trend; and (ii) accordingly, the Company was unlikely to meet its own previously issued revenue guidance for FY 2024.

    "text": "Huxtable listens to constituents, is bipartisan Sussex County needs concerned leaders like Sen. Russ Huxtable. Every other letter or article I read in the Cape Gazette is written expressing concern about the impact overdevelopment is having on our communities and the lack of planning for supporting infrastructure. Huxtable is not only concerned, but he also listens to his constituents and takes action. I am a resident of Plantations in Lewes. My neighbors and I have been concerned about the impact DelDOT construction plans will have on our community, our quality of life and our safety. When we reached out to Huxtable, he made himself available to meet with us the week after we contacted his office. He listened, made suggestions and then attended a follow-up meeting we had a few weeks later with DelDOT officials. Since this meeting, he has kept in contact with us and other communities in the area that may be similarly impacted. His understanding of the issues our communities are facing, and the infrastructure planning processes, has helped us immeasurably. Similarly, he has helped to secure other area resources. He secured $200,000 in state funding for the Lewes open space campaign to help preserve the Fourth Street Forest, the last forest in Lewes city limits. He helped pass SCR 192, a bill which will help preserve, protect and restore our three Inland Bays, important natural resources for the future of all Sussex County residents. Huxtable has demonstrated not only the ability to listen to his constituents, but also the ability to work across the aisle in a bipartisan manner to get the job done. The Legislature just passed six of the bipartisan bills he sponsored this session. We cannot afford to lose his leadership in the Legislature. I hope voters will give Huxtable the opportunity to continue the work he has begun and to fight for the Cape communities.

    "text": "Weltweit auf der Flucht: Welthungerhilfe zu neuen UNHCR-Zahlen\nBonn/Berlin (ots) - Das UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR hat heute die aktuellen Zahlen zu Flucht und Vertreibung veröffentlicht. Die Zahl der gewaltsam vertriebenen Menschen ist im vergangenen Jahr erneut gestiegen. 122,1 Millionen Menschen sind mit Stand Ende April 2025 weltweit vor Krieg und Verfolgung geflohen. Die Welthungerhilfe kommentiert die neuen Flüchtlingszahlen:\nStatement Mathias Mogge, Generalsekretär der Welthungerhilfe:\n\"Der neue Weltflüchtlingsbericht ist ein dramatischer Weckruf: Mit 122 Millionen Menschen, die weltweit auf der Flucht vor Krieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung sind, erreicht die Zahl der Vertriebenen erneut einen historischen Höchststand. Dabei trifft gewaltsame Vertreibung vor allem die Jüngsten: rund 40 Prozent aller Vertriebenen sind Kinder. Die Zahl der gewaltsamen Konflikte hat sich seit mehr als 10 Jahren verdoppelt und zwingt immer mehr Familien zur Flucht. Die meisten Geflüchteten finden dabei in den Nachbarländern Zuflucht - in Staaten, die selbst mit Armut und instabilen Strukturen zu kämpfen haben.\nDie größte Vertreibungs- und Hungerkrise spielt sich aktuell im Sudan ab. Rund ein Drittel der Menschen sind vertrieben und fast 25 Millionen Menschen leiden unter akutem Hunger. Besonders dramatisch ist die Situation rund um das Geflüchteten-Camp ZamZam in Nord-Darfur. Der Zugang für humanitäre Hilfe ist extrem eingeschränkt und es ist fast unmöglich die Menschen zu erreichen, obwohl diese so dringend auf Hilfe angewiesen sind. Im April 2025 wurde das ZamZam-Camp Ziel von mehreren gewaltsamen Angriffen, was dazu führte, dass 400.000 Menschen erneut fliehen mussten und nun ohne Hilfe im Nirgendwo ausharren müssen.\nAuch in Gaza und der Ukraine treiben Krieg und Gewalt immer mehr Menschen in die Flucht. Im Gazastreifen sind praktisch alle der über zwei Millionen Menschen auf Hilfe angewiesen. Und auch dort fehlt der ausreichende und ungehinderte Zugang zu den Hungernden.\nWährend die Zahl der Geflüchteten, der Hungernden, der gewaltsamen Konflikte steigt, werden die Mittel für humanitäre Hilfe massiv gekürzt. Das ist nicht nur unverantwortlich, sondern gefährdet jeden Tag Menschenleben. Humanitäre Hilfe darf nicht zur Disposition stehen. Sie ist überlebenswichtig.\nWenn wir nicht konsequent in Friedenslösungen investieren, wird diese Spirale aus Krieg, Vertreibung und Hunger weitergehen. Es braucht politischen Willen, Investitionen in Friedensprozesse und echte Perspektiven für den Wiederaufbau. Frieden darf kein ferner Traum bleiben. Wer heute bei der Hilfe spart, riskiert, dass morgen noch mehr Menschen alles verlieren.\"\nWeitere Informationen finden Sie unter www.welthungerhilfe.de/presse\nDie Welthungerhilfe ist eine der größten privaten Hilfsorganisationen in Deutschland; politisch und konfessionell unabhängig. Sie setzt sich mutig und entschlossen für eine Welt ohne Hunger ein. Seit ihrer Gründung am 14.12.1962 wurden 12.128 Auslandsprojekte in rund 72 Ländern mit 5,07 Milliarden Euro gefördert. Die Welthungerhilfe arbeitet nach dem Grundprinzip der Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe: von der schnellen Katastrophenhilfe über den Wiederaufbau bis zu langfristigen Projekten der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit mit nationalen und internationalen Partnerorganisationen.\nPressekontakt:\nHerausgeber:\nDeutsche Welthungerhilfe e.V.\nAnsprechpartnerinnen:\nSimone Pott\nPressesprecherin\nTelefon 0228-2288-132\nMobil 0172-2525962\nsimone.pott@welthungerhilfe.de\nAssistenz: Catherine Briones\nTelefon 0228-2288-640\npresse@welthungerhilfe.de\nwww.welthungerhilfe.de\nWeiteres Material:\nwww.presseportal.de\nQuelle: Deutsche Welthungerhilfe e.V.",
