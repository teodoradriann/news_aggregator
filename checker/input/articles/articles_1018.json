    "title": "Major investigation against WNBA Champions is getting more serious",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JUNE 11: Alysha Clark #7, Jackie Young #0, Kelsey Plum #10, A&#039;ja Wilson #22 and Kiah Stokes #41 of the Las Vegas Aces walk back onto the court after a timeout in the second quarter of their game against the Minnesota Lynx at Michelob ULTRA Arena on June 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Lynx defeated the Aces 100-86.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) The back-to-back champion Las Vegas Aces are facing some adversity, not just because of their current three-game losing streak. The Aces franchise was placed under investigation last month after the announcement of an arrangement between the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) and the Aces players that would have the former pay each player $100,000 a year for the next two seasons came to light. According to a report by The IX, the WNBA has hired a law firm to look into the deal, escalating the ongoing investigation. This isn&#039;t the first time the Aces have a been under scrutiny This isn&#039;t the first time in recent years that the Aces have faced an investigation from the league. Just last year, the two-time Champions were given sanctions for what the WNBA called &quot;violating league and team Respect in the Workplace policies&quot; and &quot;violating league rules regarding impermissible benefits.&quot; These sanctions followed an investigation into how the team was able to sign Candace Parker and trade Dearica Hamby. Aces head coach Becky Hammon faced a two-game suspension and the team lost its first round pick in the 2025 draft. However, the league never brought in outside counsel for that investigation, which The IX suggests is why this new case may be a lot more serious. The Aces&#039; players deal with the LVCVA is supposed to function like a sponsorship contract, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. These were supposedly negotiated without the knowledge of the team so as not to violate the rules of the WNBA. However, as the IX&#039;s report pointed out, it&#039;s difficult to imagine how the LVCVA was able to create this deal without knowledge of the team considering the announcement was made to the players in their own locker room. The report also noted that there is a &quot;close working relationship&quot; between the Aces owner Mark Davis and the LVCVA CEO Steve Hill. The nature of the deal is also in question. The deal was meant to pay the 12 Aces players, but not all 12 players on the team are the same throughout the year. The team already cut rookie Dyaisha Fair and added Tiffany Hayes at the end of May. More Women’s Basketball: Moreover, the LVCVA deal is supposed to go until next season, but some of the team&#039;s players including All-Star Kelsey Plum, are not under contract for the 2025 season. The result of the investigation will likely set a precedent for the league for how it deals with these types of &quot;sponsorship&quot; deals. However, in the bigger picture, the LVCVA deal shows how salaries and the treatment of players in the WNBA still remain a major issue for the league. WNBA player contracts max out at around a quarter of a million per year, while the average salary for a WNBA player is around $100,000. Aces veteran Sydney Colson called the deal &quot;life-changing&quot; when it was first announced. A similar case happened in 2022 when the New York Liberty were fined a league-record $500,000 for violating the WNBA rules regarding chartered flights. While the rule was beneficial for the players on the Liberty — and fulfilled an ask that WNBA players have been clamoring for — the team still suffered for violating the WNBA rules. While the WNBA is on the rise, it may take several years for the league to get to a steady point in its revenue — or for the players to negotiate a larger share of the pie in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement — in order for teams, players, and organizations to need not look for loopholes similar to the LVCVA deal to compensate their most important employees.",

    "text": "Gobierno de Biden amenaza con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración\nRocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos amenazó con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración en una carta enviada este jueves, según una copia que CNN obtuvo del documento. Esto supone la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y el gobernador de Texas, el republicano Greg Abbott, sobre la gestión de la frontera entre EE.UU. y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de detener a los inmigrantes y a los jueces la capacidad de emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de “increíblemente extrema”. Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEn una carta dirigida a Abbott, el Departamento de Justicia argumentó que la medida “se antepone y viola la Constitución de EE.UU.” y también amenaza con afectar la capacidad del gobierno federal para hacer cumplir la ley de inmigración.\n“En consecuencia, Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para impedir la aplicación de la SB4 a menos que Texas acceda a abstenerse de implementar la ley. Estados Unidos se ha comprometido tanto a asegurar la frontera como a garantizar el procesamiento de los no ciudadanos de conformidad con la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA). La ley SB4 es contraria a estos objetivos”, afirma la carta, firmada por el subsecretario adjunto Brian Boynton.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nLa amenaza legal de este jueves se produce después de que el Departamento de Justicia demandara a Texas por el uso de boyas flotantes en el río Grande. La demanda sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "By Brad Matthews ,\n11 hours ago\nA Foreman Creek, California, man was rescued alive from a wooded area not far from the town earlier this week after being missing since June 11.\nBefore being found Thursday, Lukas McClish, 34, had last been seen on June 11 walking on a road in Boulder Creek, which is near Big Basin Redwoods State Park. His family reported him missing on Sunday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) San Mateo-Santa Cruz Unit posted on Facebook.\nAt around 3 p.m. local time Thursday, a bystander heard someone yelling for help in the area of Foreman Creek, not far from California State Route 236.\nLocal law enforcement used drones to find Mr. McClish, and California State Parks personnel were the first to reach him, with state and local fire personnel helping him to safety, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.\nMr. McClish was found in a remote canyon below the community of Braemoor, California.\n“There are no trails, no roads, several miles from the closest place to a road, which the closest road that we got into, we had to four-wheel drive probably a quarter of a mile in and then we couldn’t go further,” Boulder Creek Fire Protection District Chief Mark Bingham told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.\nMr. McClish had no major injuries and has been reunited with his family, SCSO said . He managed to forage for sustenance in the time he was missing.\n“About 10 days he survived in the wilderness, essentially, drinking out of the creek and eating wild berries. He did have a minor injury … but, for the most part, he was disoriented and lost and surviving off of the land, which is pretty impressive,” District Chief Mark Bingham told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Boeing Workers Reject Contract, Vote For Strike; 737 MAX Production In Limbo | IBTimes",
    "text": "Nearly 30,000 of Boeing's U.S. West Coast workers have overwhelmingly voted to strike for better pay and benefits. The mass strike, which led to the halt in production of the company's best-selling jet 737 MAX, comes at a time when the aircraft maker is already reeling from ongoing struggles, including production delays, safety issues, and mounting debt.Boeing's production line in the Seattle and Portland areas will be at an impasse as thousands of workers joined the demonstrations, rejecting a proposed contract that failed to meet their demands.The contract offered general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a commitment to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area within four years. However, the workers deemed it insufficient, Reuters reported.International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members overwhelmingly rejected the proposed contract, with 94.6% voting no and 96% backing a strike. This sets the stage for a pivotal test of new CEO Kelly Ortberg's leadership skills.The strike will begin on Friday, just weeks after Ortberg took the helm as CEO in August-- an appointment aimed at reinstating faith in the company after the federal government halted the production of Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft in January due to a door panel detaching in mid-air from a nearly new 737 MAX jet mid-flight.\"We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the negotiating teams from District 751 and W24 and the unwavering solidarity of our membership. Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve,\" IAM said in a statement. The IAM is one of North America's largest and most diverse industrial trade unions, representing approximately 600,000 active and retired members in the aerospace, defense, airlines, railroad, transit, healthcare, automotive, and other industries.Boeing's stock rose 0.9% on Thursday, but its shares are still down 36% this year due to safety concerns, production issues, and a $60 billion debt burden. The strike poses a significant threat to Boeing as the airline struggles to rebound from longstanding financial and safety woes, with analysts warning of a potential $1 billion weekly loss, reported the Washington Post. The work stoppage might have a significant impact on Boeing as the union is essential to make some of its best-selling aircraft.Boeing floated the contract after months of rigorous consulting sessions. The company had proposed to build its next new aircraft in Washington state, a key union demand. Both sides and investors have lavished praise on the deal, but its rejection by workers has now left its fate hanging by a thread.With chants of \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" echoing through the union hall, the stage is set for a potentially prolonged and contentious labor dispute that will test the mettle of Ortberg and the entire Boeing organization.\"We will make every resource available for our District 751 and W24 members during this challenging time. IAM members from across North America stand in solidarity with our members in the Pacific Northwest and California. Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members,\" IAM added.© Copyright IBTimes 2024. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "CATOOSA, Okla — The Catoosa community is coming together to raise thousands of dollars for a police captain battling cancer. Captain Jennifer Swarer has been with the department for 15 years. “She’s integral to the running of our department and right now we’re missing her,” said Assistant Catoosa Police Chief Andrew Wimberley. Assistant Chief Wimberley and his friend John Holden are part of the group putting on a barbecue fundraiser Feb. 29. It’s all for Catoosa Police Captain Jennifer Swarer. “She’s an amazing woman,” said Assistant Chief Wimberley. “She’s a great police officer.” She’s facing a battle with stage four pancreatic cancer. A [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/t87ssc-medical-expenses?utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_content=facebook_cta_variant&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook)that’s raised more than $16,000 said she was experiencing stomach pain for months. After doctors did a CT scan, Captain Swarer got the news Jan. 18 that she has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. “The thing I told her was this is just like the job,” said Assistant Chief Wimberley. “We go home at the end of the shift. So, you have to take this and fight through it and we’re going to win at the end.” Fundraisers over the last month, like a chili benefit, have raised more than $8,000. Two friends, Many Horner and Jennifer Kilgore, are planning a spaghetti lunch on Saturday. “You see someone that you know needs something and it’s a lot easier if many of us can rally together and just put our arms around a friend and say we’re here for you, we want to help you,” said Mandy Horner. Saturday’s fundraiser will have auction items like a handmade quilt. It’s taking place Mar. 2, from 12 to 3:30 p.m. at Assembly of God on HWY 51 Coweta, OK. “The minute that I found out she had cancer, I just knew that they couldn’t do this alone,” said Jennifer Kilgore. Captain Swarer is a single mom and the money raised will help with medical bills and any other needs. Community members said they’re happy to help with these acts of service. “Love your community,” said John Holden. “Love your people. There’s so much going on in the world today, if we can spread a little love that’s awesome.” The barbecue fundraiser on Feb. 29 is taking place at Gazebo Park in Catoosa. It’s from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Stay in touch with us anytime, anywhere -- - Download our free app for [Apple](http://bit.ly/2wfyiphoneapp), [Android](http://bit.ly/kjrhandroid)and [Kindle](http://amzn.to/1dLTWVt)devices. - Sign up for daily [newsletters emailed to you](http://www.kjrh.com/account/manage-email-preferences) [Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kjrhtv) [Follow us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/2worksforyou/) [SUBSCRIBE on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@2NewsOklahoma)",

    "text": "Soft plastic fishing lures may be leaching into waterways: Sask. study Markus Brinkmann, associate professor in the school of Environment and Sustainability, and director of the Toxicology Centre at the University of Saskatchewan. (John Flatters / CTV News) Share If you use soft plastic fishing lures when spending a day on the water, you might want to change it up.\nA study published this summer in the journal Science of the Total Environment suggests soft plastic lures are leaching water-soluble plastic additives.\n“The research team, we are all quite avid anglers,” said Markus Brinkmann, associate professor in the school of Environment and Sustainability, and director of the Toxicology Centre at the University of Saskatchewan.\n“When you use these kinds of materials in the environment, every now and then you snap one off. Every now and then, every other trip or so, you lose a lure. And, then the big question to us was, what happens with that material?”\nThe team selected 16 common soft plastic lures and performed chemical and bio-analytical tests for leaching of phthalates and hormone-mimicking chemicals.\n“There are things in there that you would expect in plastics such as plasticizers that keep them soft and wiggly,” said Brinkmann. “But also silicone oils, these kinds of things that help them stay separated in the bag when you buy them.”\nGet the CTV News app for Saskatchewan breaking news alerts and top stories Brinkmann says 10 out of 16 lures leached phthalates, and bio-analytical testing showed the presence of xenoestrogens in one lure. Xenoestrogens are synthetic chemicals that mimic natural estrogen and can potentially bind to receptors in the body.\n“One of the issues with this chemical release is certainly that over prolonged periods of time and with the sheer amount of material that might be released by anglers, that you do get ecologically relevant impacts on wildlife,” he said. “Our study didn’t quite focus on that. That would be sort of the next steps in this research. To really do a risk assessment and see, in the big scheme of things, how much of this material is really releasing into the environment?”\nBut Brinkmann says survey data from European anglers showed there is awareness and an appetite for alternatives.\n“They're concerned with the potential environmental impacts, also human health impacts when they handle them,” Brinkmann told CTV News.\n“They wish for better alternatives but don't see any at this point. So I think the fishing community here in this case is really willing to look at the next alternative.”\nStaff at The Fishin’ Hole in Saskatoon say the type of lure anglers use depends on the type of fish they’re trying to catch. For larger fish they say it’s more common to use metal spinners and spoons, but smaller species may be more likely to bite on a soft plastic lure.\nBrinkmann says the study aimed to raise awareness as well as identify possible alternatives or push for regulation changes, as there aren’t many plasticizer-free soft plastic lures on the market currently.\n“I think we now need to look towards the manufacturers, towards regulators to also make these steps and offer that on the market.”\nSoft plastic fishing lures as a potential source of chemical pollution - Chemical analyses, toxicological relevance, and anglers’ perspectives was published in Science of the Total Environment on June 15, 2024.\nSaskatoon Top Stories\n'Very, very sad': SCYAP closes doors after 23 years of supporting Saskatoon youth\nCanada to begin processing rare mineral used to power electric vehicles\nSoft plastic fishing lures may be leaching into waterways: Sask. study\nSaskatoon holds vigil for victims of sex trade\nSaskatoon downtown arena partner cancels appearance at committee\nDry conditions continue to push crop maturity, harvest 6% complete\nAbove-average wildfire activity in Saskatchewan forecasted for remainder of season\nSmoke blankets Saskatoon as wildfires rage across province CTVNews.ca Top Stories\nWhat we know about Health Canada's response to the new global mpox outbreak Health Canada says it is 'closely monitoring' the resurgence of mpox cases, after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on Wednesday.

    "text": "入汛以来，乌拉特前旗地区雨势连绵，7月的强降雨更是接连制造“险情”。面对这场与时间赛跑的防汛硬仗，内蒙古电力集团巴彦淖尔乌拉特前旗供电公司以“汛”为令、向险而行，用最快响应、最实举措为该地排水系统撑起“电力保护伞”，书写了“人民电业为人民”的生动答卷。\n迅速响应 分秒必争保民生\n7月10日起，强降雨持续侵袭乌拉特前旗。11日上午，雷暴直击用户变电站35千伏总排变电站，该站变压器瞬间烧毁，导致承担地区排水的八排、九排扬水站彻底断电，积水以肉眼可见的速度上涨，玉米、葵花在洪水中摇摇欲坠。几乎同时，建于上世纪70年代的八、九排水所泵站因超负荷运转，在11日~12日三天内三次停泵，40多万亩农田的“排水咽喉”同时告急，据悉，此处扬水站是西小召镇、新安镇及新安农场的“命脉”，一旦排水系统瘫痪，丰收的希望将化为泡影。\n危急时刻，当地政府紧急调度，电力、农业、水利多部门联动出击。乌拉特前旗供电公司率先接令，立即启动最高等级应急响应，该公司党员、公司负责人亲自带队，党员服务队迅速出击，一场与时间赛跑、与洪水搏斗的保电战役在滂沱大雨中全面打响。\n雷霆抢修 打通排水“生命线”\n“必须让水泵先转起来！”党员服务队队长斩钉截铁。技术人员顶着暴雨冲入泥泞，争分夺秒铺设电缆、调试设备。面对扬水站内部建于上世纪70年代、因超负荷运转而反复故障的老旧线路，电力铁军毫不退缩。17名技术骨干蹚着过膝积水，细致排查泵站内部设备，火速更换故障线路部件。党员马师傅的裤腿裹满了泥浆，青年党员小李的双手也被电缆磨破。仅用1小时，应急电源车成功接入，扬水站水泵重新轰鸣！同时，技术团队果断实施负荷紧急转带，为排涝构建起“双保险”供电通道。\n未雨绸缪 筑牢防汛“电力堤坝”\n首战告捷，守护不息。深知八排、九排关乎41万亩农田安危，该公司将其列为保电核心战场，党员服务队主动扛起后续守护重任。早在7月11日暴雨来袭后，该公司便第一时间调配两辆应急电源车驻守八排、九排，安排2名工作人员24小时轮班值守，确保应急供电“不断档”，两辆应急电源车旁，“共产党员服务队”的旗帜格外醒目。与用户深入沟通，共同制定八排、九排增容供电方案，从根本上提升供电可靠性。同时，该公司输电运检班启用无人机对客户侧线路进行专项巡视，全面排查线路隐患，确保供电线路“健康运行”。\n7月18日，新的强降雨预警拉响，防御体系全面升级。紧急增援两台发电车，现场应急电源力量翻倍至四台，构筑多重保障网络。增派2组共4名精兵，24小时驻守客户侧设备，实时监测维护，确保“险情早发现、问题早处理”。\n担当闪耀 政企同心护安澜\n该公司的快速响应与精湛技术赢得了高度赞誉。7月18日一早，黄河灌溉总局乌拉特分中心特意送上“技术精湛排隐患 快速响应显担当”的锦旗，致敬风雨中无畏逆行的光明卫士。这场战役，不仅是对设备能力的考验，更是对“人民电业为人民”初心的淬炼。从雷霆抢修到未雨绸缪，从应急处突到机制建设，该供电公司以最快响应、最实举措、最强担当，在肆虐的洪涝与宝贵的民生之间，筑起了一道坚不可摧的“光明堤坝”。\n雨幕未歇，守护继续。汛期仍在持续，该供电公司党员服务队仍在与各部门深化协作，完善防汛供电保障机制。从暴雨突袭到预警升级，该公司始终以“保电就是保民生、保生产”为准则，用专业的队伍充足的设备、严密的措施，为该地排水系统撑起“电力保护伞”。在这场与风雨的较量中，电力人用坚守与担当诠释着责任，让“光明”成为抵御灾害的最强底气，为当地生产、生活安全筑牢了坚实的电力屏障。（郝悦淋）",
