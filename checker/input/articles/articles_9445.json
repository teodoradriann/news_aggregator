    "title": "Windows OOBE漏洞致使攻击者可绕过防护并获取管理员权限",
    "text": "研究人员发现了一种新的利用 Windows 初始设置体验（Out-of-Box-Experience，OOBE）的方法，该方法可绕过现有保护措施，获取 Windows 计算机的管理员权限命令行访问。\n即使实施了微软推荐的安全措施——使用 DisableCMDRequest.tag 文件来阻止已知的 Shift + F10 键盘快捷键漏洞，该技术仍然有效。这一发现凸显了 Windows 初始设置过程中持续存在的安全漏洞，可能允许未经授权的用户获取提升权限并在企业设备上创建后门账户。\n**关键发现**\n1. 新的 Win + R 漏洞利用方法可绕过 Windows OOBE 安全保护\n2. 通过设置过程中的 defaultuser0 账户获取完整管理员权限\n3. 微软不会修复此问题，唯一缓解措施是隐藏 Intune 重置按钮\nWin + R OOBE 绕过技术\nKanbach 报告称，该方法利用 Win + R 键盘组合在 OOBE 过程中生成隐藏的\"运行\"对话框，从而绕过传统安全控制。与广泛记录的 Shift + F10 技术不同，这种方法需要特定的操作序列才能成功执行。\n利用过程首先打开放大镜（Magnify.exe）等辅助工具以建立正确的窗口焦点。当放大镜窗口处于活动状态时，按下 Win + R 会启动\"运行\"对话框，尽管它仍隐藏在后台。\nWin + R OOBE Bypass\n用户可以使用 Alt + Tab 循环浏览可用窗口来显示其存在。关键漏洞在于此对话框在 defaultuser0 账户上下文中运行，这是 Windows 在 OOBE 期间创建的临时管理员账户，具有完整的本地管理员组权限。\n攻击者可以在\"运行\"对话框中输入 cmd.exe，然后按 Ctrl + Shift + Enter 触发用户账户控制（UAC）权限提升。当 UAC 提示出现并被接受时，将打开具有管理员权限的提升命令提示符，使攻击者能够执行任意系统修改、创建后门账户或更改安全配置。\n微软的回应\n这种 OOBE 突破方法带来了重大安全风险，特别是在企业环境中，用户可以通过 Microsoft Intune 公司门户启动设备重置。该漏洞允许低权限域用户只需执行一键重置并利用 OOBE 界面即可有效获取本地管理员访问权限。\n微软拒绝解决此安全问题，称 OOBE 本质上在管理会话中运行，在设置过程中无人看管设备等同于让机器处于解锁状态。该公司的立场将此视为操作安全问题，而不是需要修补的软件漏洞。\n主要缓解策略是通过在 Microsoft Intune 管理中心（租户管理 > 自定义）中隐藏重置按钮来完全阻止用户访问 OOBE。管理员应在企业 Windows 设备上启用\"隐藏重置按钮\"设置，以防止未经授权的设备重置。然而，这只是一个不完整的解决方案，只能解决表面现象，而非 Windows 设置过程中潜在的系统架构安全弱点。\n参考来源：\n[Breaking Windows Out-of-Box-Experience to Gain Command Line Access With Admin Privileges]\n如需授权、对文章有疑问或需删除稿件，请联系 FreeBuf 客服小蜜蜂（微信：freebee1024）",

Croft\nUser ID: 64648\nUnited States\n01/19/2006 08:16 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRapture Theology has destroyed Christianity\nRAPTURE THEOLOGY HAS DESTROYED CHRISTIANITY\nHow the false promise of a free ride to Heaven with a single prayer has corrupted otherwise good folks and damned the Earth by their inaction!\nJ. Croft\nfreedomguide.blogspot.com\nWhat on Earth of any worth is really free?\nA rock laying on the ground is free, but unless it's a diamond what value does it have? Other than flinging it at something or using it for paving, not much.\nSpoken words are practically free as well. Do something that harms another, and the cultural programming would have us say \"I'm Sorry\" and there; that verbal bandaid fixed that problem. No it didn't. It's used mainly to buy off the righteous outrage of the person harmed for the bargain price of a few exhalations of air and sound.\nThat sort of garbage is used a lot by guilt-ridden children. Forgive them, as they don't know any better-yet.\nIt's also used by the powerful-but only after a miraculously failed fight against the people they harm. It becomes no better than a excuse.\nAn excuse. In common usage a lame reasoning for bad decisionmaking. There's a lot of that as well, and more preferable than the \"I'm Sorry\" as there's no Guilt implied. Excuses are as plentiful in modern-day America as debt.\nAnd the damnable thing about it is, lame excuses, being free and of no value to the problems they're tacked onto are created and used by those who should know better! Those, are people that go to church and watch the televangelists as part of the worship of that excessive time waster and mental enslaver that is television.\nWhat excuses are they making for, and why?\nThe excuses are their-the self-professed \"christians\"-inactivity and submission to the many forms of corruption and darkness that are gripping our communities, our Nation and our World. They who preen about as if Righteous permit many crimes. I'll make list of fairly recent events that barely carves a snowball off the tip of the iceberg:\n1.)Emil Gonzalez; a 6 year old Cuban refugee from Castro's hellish communism, some folks actually bothered to defend him from Janet Reno. The ugliest Attorney General in U.S. history staged a cowardly SWAT raid at 4 in the morning at his relative's home and literally at MACHINE GUN POINT a terrorist looking \"agent\" kidnapped that child out of the hands of the man who literally had saved him from the Atlantic Ocean.\nSo, where was the outrage from Pat Robertson? Why didn't he lead a crusade against his bud Jeb Bush and that shaved Sasquatch(you can tell I hate that woman)? Better yet, when Pat the walking bobblehead doll did his aw shucks what can you do routine, why didn't all those seemingly good folks not take their own initiative and consider that the last straw? Probably for the same excuses that made all those \"good christians\" fail to even utter a peep for their fellow believers in-\n2.)Waco. ATF-better known as F-Troop-these folks are the result of the failed Whisky Rebellion in the 1790's. President George Washington himself led a 15,000 man army into the hills of rural Pennsylvania to put down a righteous rebellion of ordinary folks resisting a onerous tax on distilled spirits made by a power mad wanna be tyrant Alexander Hamilton. The rebellion crushed, the treasury department made the bureau that would eventually grow into regulating taxes on tobacco and … firearms.\nTwo hundred years after the Whisky Rebellion this same outfit of tax regulators would be equipped with body armor, military communications and the world's finest fully automatic weapons would go regulate a… church. A commune to be more precise but Freedom of Association is implied with our Bill of Rights. Now David Koresh did deal in firearms at the Texas gunshows, but he went out of his way to be cooperative with F-Troop. Even though right of uninfringed firearms ownership is explicitly stated in our Bill of Rights. They even shot at targets together and Koresh was often in town. He was in that respect law abiding.\nSo why, really was a firearms tax regulating bureau sent on a bizarrely stupid and excessive military style attack, treating the Davidians like a enemy objective? If Koresh DID commit child rape, that was the perview of the Texas State Police and Rangers. How come they didn't bust him in town? If Koresh DID brew methanphetamines, that was also not in F-Troop's jurisdiction. But firearms regrettably are as born witness by the THOUSANDS sent to America's prisons for the lamest of reasons. Koresh invited inspection of his firearms business.\nF-Troop decided to attack, and make their ineptitude in military and police matters preserved on video for all time. So the big boys of the FBI were sent in and after 81 days of shooting at stragglers trying to surrender and non-stop psychological warfare they burn that clapboard compound to the ground and use CS gas that turns to a cyanide when burnt.\nSo where were the Branch Davidian's fellow Christians? Why were they allowed to be murdered by the government without protest? Children were burned and poisoned alive, and all the worshippers of Jerry Falwell could do is keep their born again heads tucked firmly in the sand. What lame excuse did they have?\n3.) Terri Shiavo; where are those \"christians\" that worship T.D. Jakes-other than at their self-glorifying temple to him? Why aren't they raising holy hell with the state of Florida and her conniving lawyer-husband to give her the treatment that will cure her? Her brain problems are treatable, yet only a handful of people, and her loving Parents have risen to this helpless woman's defense?\n4.)The \"Patriot Acts\". The first of these abominations was passed mere weeks after 9-11; as a legal document you could literally knock someone out with it if you had the muscles to chuck it, it's that thick. Nobody read it. Nobody had time to read it. It was near unaminously passed. And a Police State was officially codified.\nAnd now hundreds of thousands of petty, power mad bureaucrats and legions of automatic weapon wielding ninja garbed goons terrorize us all. Where the hell is the outrage? Why aren't the Christians, those that are supposed to be bravely defending the virtues of America organizing and cleaning the Senate and the House of Representatives of all those traitors to God and Freedom? Is it that they're too busy? Too cowardly? Or is it all for this war on terror?\n5.)War on Terrorism-how do you wage war on a military strategy? Or rather, how does anyone of conscience stand by and approve invading nations that had nothing to do with September 11? Iraq didn't have nuclear weapons after the first Gulf War. They didn't even have terrorists until after we invaded and finished on the ground what over a decade of bombings didn't get-their nation's destruction. We have created a new Vietnam War for us to lose and killed hundreds of thousands in a doomed attempt to secure the oil fields before India and China catch up to America in consumption with over half the people on Earth. There's no way that enough oil can be pumped out to satisfy everyone, so there will be war. Where are all those people packing America's megachurches? Why do they not object to war, to tyranny, to murder and repression?\nThere are thousands of injustices over the years that America's \"christians\" have let slip, and the world has become a lot more dangerous place to be in. Our-their-world is dying and they let it happen, even quiver with excitement like the day before Christmas. Why?\nThey're waiting for the rapture. That theological free ticket out of having any responsibility for their inaction and cowardice in the face of the dark forces trying to destroy this world. These self-professed followers of Jesus Christ are locked in a death cult mindset that predicates what they reckon as salvation on the death and damnation of nearly all of Mankind. So they sit their useless corpulent butts in their pews and lazy boys and listen to the toxic crap sold as gospel:\n*Give money to your church!\n*Obey your leaders!\n*Pay your taxes!\n*Support the system!\n*Sneer at outsiders. They're going to hell anyway.\n*We need even MORE MONEY so we can build a bigger church!\n*But if you give, Gawd shall annoint and bless you and give you a better job, a better credit line, and a bigger SUV to get you to our megachurch and give bigger tithes!\n*There's a Apocalypse coming, and there isn't a thing you can do to stop it, because every evil deed was preordained by the Lord Himself. But there's a easy way out-just confess Jeezus as your lord and savior, and when it's time for the lawd to tell Satan to finish off the planet, he'll take your good, tithe and taxpaying fatbody up to Heaven! That's it. That's all it takes.\n*Support your President in the meantime. He believes in the Rapture-hell, he's trying his best to make the Apocalypse happen sooner, so we can all drive around in Heavenly SUV's and reside in even bigger versions of the homes we have here in 'Murika, and endless TV watching.\nTHAT IS NOT THE TRUTH!\nThe first Truth about the \"Rapture\" is that your average brainwashed 'Murikan churchgoer would never DESERVE such a out! We are all responsible for what we do and think, and if we allow others to take charge, to do our thinking for us, to tell us what to do, to define the dogma of what scripture says about God, then we have failed in our individual and collective responsibilities.\nWe are our Brother and our Sister's keeper. By implication, we are also keepers of the integrity of the institutions we consent to have over us. And we have failed utterly to keep those institutions in check so is it any wonder that our legislatures and our schools, and our churches and our media have been taken over by forces hellbent on destroying us all? Such people who would lie on their backs like a puppy wanting it's urine crusted belly scratched don't deserve Heaven.\nThe second Truth is that there is no mention by Jesus Christ in what is accepted as the Four Gospels of a rapture-as defined by modern christian theology.\nJesus mentions coming for a Bride-someone worthy of a union of equals, a fraternity with God. Godly people do NOT allow corruption and theft and murder without a fight to the death.\nJesus mentions that this Bride is without guile or defiled-that is this union is with people who do not follow false teachings. Regrettably there are false teachings in the Nicea Council Approved Biblical Canon; a bastardized work cobbled together by the Roman Emperor Constatine of watered down Gospel, Paul's abominations and the Hebrew Torah to forge a document that has either enslaved or caused those who study it to reject God.\nI personally, nearly fell for that cruel trick. I stuck with God in my heart however and overcame the lies and deceptions. And because of that I can testify this: the assembled Bible is a brilliant manipulation by the Devil.\nYes there was Jesus-what Christianity is supposed to be about, but He's represented by four books composed long after the Resurrection. Most of what Jesus-probably 99.9 percent is supressed.\nThe rest is the Torah and Paul. And the Apocalypse. There's a disconnect one finds when one starts using wise discernment.\nThe Torah and Pentatuch-the Old Testament-are about Yahweh, who acted like the devil himself in forging a religion to worship him. Yahweh was very demanding, and very brutal about enforcing those demands to the point of slaughtering innocents and permitting theft and rape of entire peoples in the enslaved Hebrew's conquests. In that, Yahweh acted no differently than any of the pantheon of gods of other peoples of that era.\nJesus however claimed to fulfill the law so what happened to the Old Testament can be said to be in question. The Torah WAS precisely written to a extreme-over the centuries, and yet if there is a single mark that's wrong on a handscribed torah it is ceremoniously burned. Why the demand for such precision? Why else, so that you can find bible codes in it. On this I'll make a opinion; Yahweh, a great intelligence, but not God is still arranging things to suit him.\nOr, maybe God really is crazy-bipolar, or has schizophrenia or is disassociative. Perhaps it was manipulated by God. Or the devil. Perhaps Jesus came to save the Hebrews from themselves? Whatever it is, there's a disconnect that either enslaves or causes people to reject God because they blame the religion handed to them. And since nobody on Earth has a time machine, this issue can only be settled by wrestling with your faith-and the part of God that's in your heart.\nThere is that disconnect, but another disconnect that finishes sabotaging Christianity is Saul of Tarsus-a Pharisee. Jesus cursed the Pharisees. Saul's writings comprise most of the New Testament, yet he was never, ever with Jesus. In fact, he persecuted Jesus' followers and would brag about his evil works even after being \"converted\". Saul's writings emphasized everything Jesus was set against.\nJesus spoke of faith and works to back up that faith. Paul preached that a few nice words, a \"I'm Sorry\" to God are sufficient, when they're not by all the evils that have flourished since he died.\nJesus made no excuses. He healed the sick, took care of the underclasses and went to war against the financial and religious elites of his day, advocated personal possession of military arms even at the cost of having nothing else-and paid the ultimate price willingly. All Paul could say was to say \"yas suh, Boss\", and obey your masters, even if you were a slave.\nAnd that house slave mentality has permeated America. A deceiver, Paul would feel at home as a elite of a Nation that propagandizes Freedom, yet taxes and regulates and enslaves and poisons and murders more than any other in history. Don't believe me, just look it up in the history books-even they attest to America's un-Christianity.\nFortunately, Saul of Tarsus has had his bones blackened by the fires of hell for the past two millenia. Of that I have faith in.\nAnd speaking of hellfire, there is Revealation. Some John gets whisked away in a psychedelic encounter with angels and events far in the future are laid out. Cryptic tales of evil beings and battles and great destruction and the genocide of the Human Race-we are to be rarer than fine gold. Thank, God.\nOr, maybe it's not?\nAs presented in the Bible it reads as God's Plan, but that's like Americans destroying towns and cities all over the Earth to save those we war from themselves. Yes God shall judge, but God also wants to save Humanity, and has also stated in the Bible He can and would shorten and even cancel apocalypses-especially those arranged by the enemy.\nBut that's not what's taught. God is presented as wrathful to the point of wanting Humanity to cruelly perish. That presentation destroys faith, and those that it hasn't are, naturally given an easy out.\nThe Rapture.\nJust ask to have Jesus in your heart, don't do anything else to upset the apocalyptic apple cart and if you're around when the bugle blows you get a free out. How more irresponsible, how more ungodly could a doctrine get? It can't! Your salvation dependent upon supporting the status quo and your World's destruction?\nBe of wise discernment. I personally was at one time a pre-millenialist fundamentalist Christian-but only because I was forcibly sent to church at an early age and regrettably became enamored by the falsehoods preached by Hal Lindsey, and some other crusty old phart who is happily forgotten who actually gave a date on TV and arranged a tour for the \"holy land\".\nBut one day I started to read it for myself. I fell away from rapture theology after I discovered how the Bible couldn't support itself. Containing warped truth and lies, how can it? So I stumbled, but NEVER having rejected God outright allowed me to approach the Father objectively. And I thank Him for the wisdom and strength to make the journey-not back, but to Him in the first place! How? I was objective, I was logical, I used my God Given Wisdom and Discernment and reasoned for myself and struggled mightily with God against my societally given belief systems and cast them aside for the lying trash they are.\nI faced the wilderness and the hard questions and overcame, and joined my Father.\nAs should all those that start actually reading the Bible objectively and in partnership with God who resides in your heart. And faces all the hard questions that shall pop up-and they shall, and shall floor you. This is your struggle-you must be brave and face it yourself. You get floored by Truth, you get up anyway. Your trust is to be in God-not Jesus who said there is none good but the Father. Certainly not in a devious Pharisee or a bloodthirsty demigod who requires flying contraptions, fire and wanton human savagery.\nMost certainly NOT in the likes of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jack Van Impe, Oral Roberts, T.D. Jakes and the rest of those spiritual hustlers. And it goes without saying that you never, ever put your trust in the likes of a U.S. government that has burdened the people it purportedly serves with more taxes, more niggling regulations enforced by psychotic gun wielding bureaucrats, enslaved more people for more legislated and socially engineered crimes in hellish prisons, and killed more people in wars of conquest than any other government, ever.\nYou put your faith in God. God has no need of guilt ridden slaves or ornate buildings or spiritual pimps. God detests such things. He has need of You. He needs you, wants you to know Him and to grow in love and friendship, and to test everything, even holy scriptures, even spirits, even Him. Because God can pass every test and is happy to prove He loves you and me. Service among Friends is a mutual, joyous thing. It is works, mutual favors, looking out for our Brothers and Sisters no matter what the manipulated and perverted authorities color them as. Feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, healing the sick, defending the defenseless, freeing those enslaved, casting out demons and other turds polluting our institutions, setting past wrongs right.\nAnd God will come to our rescue, of that I have faith. We don't have to go through a genocidal apocalypse; if we seek God and ask for help He will deliver the Human Race from those that plot to destroy it, no matter how much they pawn themselves off as Him. God shall do this anyway! God however will not help those who suscribe to a false religion that promotes evils yet paints itself as salvation. He certainly won't be taking those, or even those who DO know God from Earth and let the rest of Humanity perish in the hands of Satan. God wants us to FIGHT for our Brothers and Sisters-ALL of Man is our Brothers and Sisters! Black, White, Red, Yellow, German, Zulu, Russian, Korean, Iranian, Australian, Japanese, Columbian, Mexican, and definitely Americans of all the flavors of Humanity.\nAnd when We have awakened from the deceptions handed down as religion and ideology, and risen for the fight for our Earth, God shall stand by our side to cut short the Apocalypse, to crush the plans of those that would enslave and destroy us. And it won't matter what the enemy throws at us, with God in our hearts in partnership we'll overcome it.\nThe Human Race has not even begun to express it's genius, it's true capabilities without the chains of enslaving religious dogma and oppressive government that currently bind us and make us spiritually and materially ineffective. When we free ourselves with God from those enslavements I have faith that we shall soon enough be able crush the evil ones. I would only suggest that to prevent our Race from ever being enslaved again we actively make certain that those that tried to do us all in never ever get another chance.\nWhen we liberate ourselves from satanically inspired \"christian\" dogmas and oppression we won't need a Rapture, a easy ticket out when we can annex Earth into Heaven. We-you-should be insulted by being offered a cop out like that. And you need to start calling out those spiritual pimps that preach such crap.\nSo stop praying for death and a ticket out. You'll just get the death and God will curse you for being a evil coward and you'll get to see what 2,000 years of hellfire does to human souls by watching Saul of Tarsus as you burn yourself. Saying \"I'm Sorry\" or making lame excuses at that moment will just annoy God more.\nSo, be just and righteous and loving and pray for God to have a direct relationship in your heart. God's infinite and should be listened to. Pray for Life and Freedom, and deliverance of us all from the devil and his apocalypse-including you. And take Personal Responsibility for securing the victory yourself and for everyone around you.\nOf this I make this written prayer to God. Amen.\nJ.

When the road turns north, the climbing starts. It winds high into the Selkirk Mountains and dead ends on a ridge close to Salmo Mountain. Then there are no more roads.\nFrom there to the Canadian border lies the Salmo Basin, a deep drainage filled with a cedar and hemlock forest that’s threaded by the South Fork of the Salmo River. A trail begins there and dives downhill to the river, cutting through a dense cedar and hemlock forest to begin a 19-mile loop through the Salmo-Priest Wilderness.\nThe horseshoe-shaped area covers more than 41,000 acres of wild country in Washington’s far northeastern corner, where caribou once roamed and grizzly bears still do.\nPermanent federal protections arrived for the Salmo-Priest 40 years ago with the passage of the Washington Wilderness Act. The law expanded some wilderness areas and created 19 new ones, protecting more than 1 million acres in all. It was part of a wave of legislation nationwide that made 1984 the biggest year in history for wilderness designations.\nFor the Salmo-Priest, it was the culmination of a battle that started more than a decade earlier, with a bear hunt and the discovery of plans for a new road.\nSurvey stakes\nRay Kresek is best known as the region’s leading expert on the history of fire lookouts. His house on the far north side of Spokane doubles as the Fire Lookout Museum, and it’s overflowing with U.S. Forest Service artifacts – old tools, Smokey Bear memorabilia, even a mock lookout in the backyard.\nHe’s also the guy who started the push to protect the Salmo-Priest.\n“It’s a long story, but it was a tough one,” Kresek said.\nIt began in the late 1960s, when Kresek went bear hunting in the Salmo Basin, one of his favorite spots.\nHe didn’t get one, and he was glad. The forest was so thick he thinks there was no way he’d have ever gotten it home. He did find something else, however.\nWhen he got down to the river, he saw that survey stakes had been pounded into the ground. They continued on the other side of the river, and he followed them up another creek drainage.\n“I thought, ‘for God sakes, are they going to put a road down here?’ ” Kresek said.\nOn his way back to Spokane, he stopped at the Forest Service’s Sullivan Lake office to ask about what he’d found. Sure enough, there were plans to extend the road from the top of the ridge down to the Salmo River, and for logging the basin.\nThe way Kresek puts it, he “had some whiskers back then.” He was president of the Spokane Mountaineers, and he had connections to a broader network of outdoor clubs in the West, including the Sierra Club.\nHe marshaled an army to fight the Forest Service’s plans and to call for protecting the basin. Initially, they weren’t thinking about a wilderness designation, but Kresek said it became clear that was the only way to permanently preserve the basin.\nHe drew up a boundary, designing it to include as much roadless land as possible. It looks mostly the same as the shape that is shown on maps today – a U-shape around the top of the Sullivan Creek drainage, wrapping around Crowell Ridge, the Salmo Basin and the Shedroof Divide. He also extended the border into the Priest River drainage in Idaho, which completed the name.\nThere was plenty of opposition. Loggers and local officials argued the area was full of valuable timber, and that it needed to stay open to industry to keep the lumber supply steady and fuel the local economy.\nKresek argues that the trees weren’t worth the effort it would take to log them. A firefighter by trade, he was teaching wildland fire classes at Spokane Community College at the time. One summer he had some students go to the basin with a bore to see what was inside the cedar trees. The work showed that the trees were hollow.\nThat didn’t do much to quiet the opposition. In a Spokane Daily Chronicle story from August 1970, Pend Oreille County officials lambasted the proposal, criticizing its backers as outsiders who were ingnoring local voices. Kresek countered that the land belonged to everyone, not just those who live in Pend Oreille County.\nStill, the wilderness supporters pushed forward. Thousands of petitions supporting the designation were signed, thanks in part to the efforts of Kresek’s wife and kids, who gathered signatures outside a local grocery store.\nKresek made the case for wilderness at public meetings, occasionally in front of unfriendly crowds. At a meeting at a grange hall in Newport, he was locked in a kitchen and only let out once everyone had left. Another time, after leaving a meeting in Metaline, he found his car had two flat tires.\nHe also spent a lot of time in the place he was trying to protect. He and his family camped there and hiked all the trails. They liked it.\n“It’s just a peaceful place,” Kresek said. “A gentle wilderness.”\nThe push for protections secured a big win early. Because the area was being considered for wilderness designation, the Forest Service shelved the logging and road projects and put a moratorium on development there.\nOnly Congress could go further. But Kresek said the conversation seemed to die down in the middle of the 1970s. There were times he thought it was dead.\n“It kind of fell into limbo,” Kresek said.\nStatewide push\nIn addition to immediately protecting 9.1 million acres, the 1964 Wilderness Act directed federal agencies to examine their lands and recommend additional areas to be added to the National Wilderness Preservation System. New designations followed relatively quickly. By 1974, the U.S. had 91 wilderness areas encompassing more than 13.5 million acres.\nStill, progress wasn’t happening fast enough for some wilderness advocates. There were groups who wanted to see all kinds of places protected. It became clear to some advocates that the best way to go about it would be to package several proposals together in a single state-based bill.\nSimilar campaigns cropped up in multiple states. In Washington, the campaign was led by the Washington Wilderness Coalition, now known as Washington Wild. Founded in 1979, the group’s leaders traveled the state to gin up support for a statewide push to protect multiple areas.\nThe issue then became what belonged in a Washington wilderness bill. In the northeastern part of the state, there was significant support for two proposed areas: one in the Kettle Range, near Republic, and Kresek’s proposal for the Salmo Priest.\nCongress considered a few versions of a statewide bill in the early 1980s, but the final version wasn’t set until 1984, after long negotiations among the Washington congressional delegation led by Spokane Democratic Rep. Tom Foley, according to a history published by Washington Wild.\nThere were intense negotiations over several areas, but the delegation finally came to an agreement that included 23 wilderness proposals – 19 new areas and four expansions of existing areas – and additional designations such as the Mount Baker National Recreation Area and the North Cascades Scenic Highway.\nNot everything got into the bill. The proposal for the Kettle Range was carved out, a disappointment for supporters who had been campaigning to protect that area for years.\nMeanwhile, the Salmo-Priest survived. Mountain caribou were a big reason why – the Selkirks were the last place in the Lower 48 that the animals still used, and a wilderness designation would protect their habitat.\nSomething to celebrate\nThe final version of the wilderness boundary was different from the one Kresek drew up years earlier. His proposal was for about 36,000 acres in Washington and Idaho. The version in the Washington Wilderness Act, which President Ronald Reagan signed in July 1984, was more than 41,000 acres and completely in Washington. The Idaho portion is managed as wilderness, but it has never been formally designated.\nThe caribou are now gone. The last known caribou in the U.S. portion of the Selkirks was trapped and hauled north into Canada five years ago.\nOther pieces of the ecosystem remain. Wolves, grizzly bears, big cedar trees. The silence, the stunning views, the absence of roads.\nKresek hasn’t been back in 10 years or so, he said. He’s 86, and his hiking days are long over. The Salmo-Priest looms large in his head, though, and on the walls of his basement.\nThere’s a photo of the falls on the Priest River, in the zone he still hopes will one day be added to the wilderness area. There’s another of Kresek staring at a giant cedar.\nAnd there’s one of him and his son Mike, standing next to the brand new Salmo-Priest Wilderness sign, all fresh and clean. It was taken in 1986, shortly after the sign was put up.\nKresek is quick to say it wasn’t just him. Without the help of the rest of the Spokane Mountaineers and the Sierra Club and many others who joined him in the fight, plus all the work it took to pass the Washington Wilderness Act, the designation might never have happened.\nBut the fight did take over his life for more than a decade. He’d say it was worth it.\n“It was an experience of a lifetime,” Kresek said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated Rep. Tom Foley’s political party. He was a Democrat.",
