    "title": "Bassitt says everyone to blame as Jays' shoddy season worsens with 13-0 loss to Rays",
    "text": "TORONTO — Chris Bassitt declared everyone in the Toronto Blue Jays organization should bear the blame for its shoddy season.\nBassitt (8-9) made his remarks after the Tampa Bay Rays (52-51) throttled the Blue Jays (46-56) 13-0 with 16 hits in the rubber match of their three-game series on Thursday.\n“I would say there’s not a single person in probably the whole organization who's not disappointed right now,\" Bassitt said.\n“It just sucks. I don’t think anyone thought this is what was going to happen.\n“I don’t think there’s one person with clean hands right now. I really don’t think we’ve done anything well this year. Well, maybe (Daulton) Varsho’s defence.\n“Besides Varsho’s defence, I don’t see how anyone can say ‘I’ve done what I should.'\"\nBassitt also remarked that the embarrassing loss was because the team has been fighting \"demons.\"\nWhat did he mean?\n“Everything that’s been going on,\" Bassitt said.\n\"It’s whatever it might be, giving up that many hits, not being able to hit and the trade deadline. Who’s going to be here, who’s not going to be here? There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.\"\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,\" Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn't sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,\" Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. \"But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n\"When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTaj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits. Rosario pounded a double and two singles.\nON THE MEND\nBlue Jays utility infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) could begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, provided there are no setbacks, according to Schneider.\nKiner-Falefa has been out since July 1 and has enjoyed a solid season with a .292 average and .338 on-base percentage.\nON DECK\nThe Blue Jays begin a three-game set against the Texas Rangers on Friday to conclude their nine-outing, 10-day homestand. Toronto's Yusei Kikuchi (4-9) will open the series against lefty Andrew Heaney (4-10).\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nTim Wharnsby, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy. The FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels. “The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance. Even then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.” People are also reading… Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms. Aaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said. Many highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms. Parker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels. “They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said. According to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked. The North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported. Marian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.” Heather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi. Mushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died. Before the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.” The FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert. The study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication. The study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms. Hallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs. In the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said. There hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "text": "Favoriten: the classroom becomes a model for society in Ruth Beckermann’s compassionate doc Austrian filmmaker Ruth Beckermann takes an unhurried and optimistic approach to documenting a class of primary school children in the working-class Viennese neighbourhood of Favoriten. As chronic underfunding and culture wars leave their mark on already teetering education systems, is it any wonder that documentarians are turning to the classroom as a significant site of interest? Marie Speth’s Mr Bachmann and His Class (2021) films in loving detail a class of 12-year-olds in the diverse German city of Stadtallendorf; and most recently, Claire Simon turned her lens on another Parisian institution with Elementary (2024). Joining the growing curriculum is Austrian film-maker Ruth Beckermann’s compassionate documentary Favoriten. Favoriten was filmed over three years, and follows a primary-school class from the ages of seven to 10 in the eponymous working-class Viennese neighbourhood. Steered by their kind yet unabashedly ambitious teacher Ilkay Idiskut, the children improve language skills and learn about the world, discussing the war between Russia and Ukraine, exploring Islamic and Christian theology. Taking an unhurried observational approach that lets us see the children develop over the years, the film sees the classroom as a model for society. While never heavy-handed in pushing its perspective, Favoriten is a pointedly vibrant portrait of inner-city multiculturalism. Zoom out and you’ll find a political climate in Austria of increasing hostility towards migrants, signalled in the recent election victory of the ultra-far-right Freedom Party. In a poignant scene, the children discuss their parents’ blue-collar jobs, a hint at the glass ceiling faced by many immigrant families. Ilkay, on the other hand, believes they can do better. It’s impossible to remain dry-eyed at the tenacity of the teacher and the adoration of her students. Ilkay patiently explains the workings of society and is unafraid to confront toxic, sexist and misogynist behaviour, which emerges in the repeated phrases of the sponge-like children. When the bullying of a small child is uncovered, she quickly shifts from patient to confrontational, offering her students a firm model of responsible adulthood. In a welcome gesture of inclusivity, Beckermann also gives the children the tools to film themselves and includes some passages in the documentary. This action upends their passive position as documentary subjects, a role that can feel exploitative, even in such a well-meaning documentary. In a world where children are constantly being documented by camera phones and social media, the contemporary classroom doc makes me question the value of filming those so young and perfectly unformed. To paraphrase Pink Floyd, maybe we should leave the kids alone. ► Favoriten is screening at the ICA London from 6 December.

    "text": "Sadly, 2023 has been a violent year on the global stage. War broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis, including many children, on both sides. And the bitter war between Russia and Ukraine continued with no end in sight.\nAs a result of the focus on these two conflicts, other countries have fallen off the radar for many people. However, some of these countries are dealing with growing unrest, which could erupt in 2024 and make global headlines.\nSo, where should we look in the coming year? Here are five places where I believe civil conflict or unrest could get worse and potentially lead to violence.\nmyanmar\nMyanmar descended into a state of chaos in 2021 when a military coup overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered widespread civilian protests that eventually turned into armed resistance.\nHome to 135 ethnic groups there has rarely been peace in this country. For years before the coup, there was an ongoing low-grade civil conflict between the military and several minority ethnic groups who had long sought independence from the state and control of natural resources in their areas.\nThe explosion came after the coup as ethnic militia groups opposing the junta joined forces with pro-democracy fighters from the Bamar majority.\nTheir resistance increased with a coordinated northern offensive in late 2023, causing the army's largest losses in many years.\nThe rebels gained control of towns and villages along the northeastern border with China, including control of key trade routes. This led to renewed fighting in western Rakhine state as well as other areas.\nThe tenacity of resistance from these minority groups, combined with the military's refusal to compromise, suggests that the country's civil war could worsen significantly in 2024 and regain international attention.\ngardener\nIn Mali, a country in Africa's restive Sahel region, tensions have been rising throughout 2023 and are now at risk of breaking out into full-scale civil war.\nMali has been struggling with rebel activities for a long time. In 2012, Mali's government fell in a coup and Tuareg rebels, backed by Islamic militants, seized power in the north.\nThe United Nations peacekeeping mission was established in 2013 to bring stability to Mali. Then, in 2015, major rebel groups signed a peace agreement with the government of Mali.\nRead more: Mali crisis: UN peacekeepers leaving after 10 years – what is needed for a smooth transition\nFollowing two more coups in 2020 and 2021, military authorities consolidated their power and said they would restore the state's full territorial control over all of Mali. The regime insisted on withdrawing the UN peacekeeping mission from the country, which it did in June 2023. Subsequently, violence broke out between the army and rebel forces over the future use of UN bases.\nIn November, forces reportedly backed by Russia's Wagner Group took control of the strategic northern town of Kidal, which had been held by Tuareg forces since 2012. This undermines the fragile peace that has been in place since 2015.\nIt is unlikely that the army will regain full control of all rebel-held areas in the north. Also, the morale of the militants is high. With the 2015 peace agreement now almost over, we can expect increased instability in 2024.\nlebanon\nIn 2019, widespread civil protests broke out in Lebanon against leaders who were believed to be not addressing the day-to-day needs of the population.\nThe situation continued to deteriorate with government changes, a growing economic crisis, and a massive port explosion that exposed corrupt practices.\nProtests outside a bank in Lebanon after the lira hit an all-time low against the US dollar in March 2023. Wael Hamzeh/EPA\nThe International Monetary Fund criticized Lebanon in September for a lack of economic reform. The Lebanese government has also failed to agree on the appointment of a president, a position that has been vacant for more than a year.\nThis threatens to undermine the fragile power-sharing arrangement in Lebanon, in which the key political posts of prime minister, speaker and president are allocated to Sunni-Muslims, Shia-Muslims and Christian Maronites respectively.\nRecently, the war between Israel and Hamas has threatened to spread to Lebanon, home to the Hezbollah terrorist group, which claims to have an army of 100,000 fighters. Crucially, this jeopardizes tourism as Lebanon's main hope for economic recovery.\nThese factors could lead to a more serious economic and political collapse in 2024.\nPakistan\nSince Pakistan's independence in 1947, the military has played an interventionist role in politics. Although Pakistani leaders are popularly elected, military authorities have at times removed them from power.\nIn 2022, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan became disillusioned with the militant leaders of Pakistan. He was later ousted from power in a parliamentary vote and later arrested on charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated.\nHis arrest sparked violent demonstrations across the country – a display of anger against the military that was once unimaginable.\nPakistan also faces instability and increasing terrorist attacks in neighboring Afghanistan. These security challenges are further compounded by the struggling economy and the ongoing costs of devastating floods in 2022.\nPakistan is expected to hold parliamentary elections in February 2024, after which the current military caretaker government is expected to transfer power to civilian rule. Many people are keeping a close eye on the army. If this transfer of power does not occur, or is delayed, civil unrest may occur.\nRead more: How Imran Khan's populism has divided Pakistan and left it on a knife's edge\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka faced a debilitating economic crisis in 2022 leading to severe shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Due to civil protests, then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had to flee the country. He was replaced by current President Ranil Vikram Singh.\nStability returned in 2023 as Sri Lanka began implementing economic reforms as part of a bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. However, widespread dissatisfaction with the political elite and the underlying drivers of the country's economic difficulty have not been addressed.\nSoldiers blocked the road as workers protest against the government's domestic debt restructuring process and new labor laws proposed in July 2023. Chamila Karunaratne/EPA\nElections are also to be held in Sri Lanka by the end of 2024. While incumbent Vikramsingh is likely to run for a second term, his confidence among the public is low. He is seen as very close to the corrupt political elite.\nThis discontent could lead to renewed protests – especially if the economy falters again – a repeat of the same situation that led to Rajapaksa's ouster in 2022.\nSource: theconversation.com",
