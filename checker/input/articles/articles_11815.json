    "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has announced that Indian national Gopichand Thotakura will be part of a six-member crew that will blast off into space on the next New Shepard mission.A successful launch will make the US-based wellness entrepreneur and pilot the second Indian citizen in space after wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984 and the country’s first civilian astronaut. Astronauts Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Raja Chari and Sirisha Bandla were US citizens of Indian origin. The date of the launch of the NS-25 suborbital mission has not been announced but is likely to take place within the next few weeks. Thotakura, 30, was born in Vijayawada and is currently the co-founder of Preserve Life, a multi-million-dollar wellness centre being developed on the outskirts of US’ Atlanta, but has retained his Indian passport.Thotakura told ET that he hoped his journey into space as a civilian would make the idea of being an astronaut more accessible for Indian children. He said he’d been fascinated by aerospace ever since visiting a KLM plane cockpit at age eight. Thotakura is also a trained pilot who ran a medical air-evacuation service in India around a decade ago. Space was an extension of that dream. He said that his family — also into the wellness business — came to know about his plans to go into space only after Blue Origin made the official announcement. They are nervous but excited, he said. Joining him on the mission will be venture capitalist Mason Angel, French entrepreneur Sylvain Chiron, US tech entrepreneur Kenneth L Hess, retired accountant and adventurer Carol Schaller, and former US Air Force captain Ed Dwight. The latter was selected in 1961 as the first US black astronaut candidate but could not be part of a mission.NS-25 will be Blue Origin’s first crewed launch after the failure of the uncrewed NS-23 in September 2022. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had grounded all Blue Origin launches until an investigation into the failure was completed. It recommended 21 corrective actions, including redesigning certain engine components.NS-24, the first mission since the failure, was launched successfully in December 2023. Until now, Blue Origin has flown six astronaut missions, taking 31 humans above the Kármán line. That’s the boundary between earth and space and is between 80 and 100 km above sea level. Blue Origin’s pitch for the flight is simple: “On your 11-minute flight, you'll travel over 3x the speed of sound to pass the Kármán Line at 100 km, float weightless for several minutes, and witness life-changing views of earth before descending gently under parachutes.”For Thotakura, this will be a sponsored launch, although details like the identity of the sponsor and the amount paid to Blue Origin to make it happen have not been revealed.Blue Origin, along with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, has been competing for the last few years to attract space tourists. That is a business which, according to UBS, is expected to cross $3 billion in value by 2030. Bezos and Blue Origin have put in place an interesting pricing strategy. What you pay could be anywhere between nothing, especially if you are a celebrity and can attract eyeballs, and $28 million. The latter was the amount paid for the first ticket to space that Blue Origin sold in an auction. William Shatner, aged 90, was invited to a New Shepard mission for free back in 2021. Shatner played Captain Kirk in Star Trek, the cult television series that had a huge impact on a generation of scientists and techies.",

    "text": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes [will shift away from military commanders](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190731402/military-code-sexual-assault-biden-gillibrand) to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's [Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military](https://www.sapr.mil/sites/default/files/public/docs/reports/AR/FY22/DOD_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military_FY2022.pdf) showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3627334/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-offices-of-special/), Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the [National Institute of Military Justice](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nimj.org/__;!!Iwwt!UbPCvSmbGISuvrCLw1BPxxJS6qOL83gyaz8yBDSEXfcqUNpX0M2GK3oeNrdji2ifc4zOhakHQBUDl2_hTJPlMVGkag$), said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will also still be handled by those in the chain of command who have lost confidence to handle cases such as those dealing with sexual assault. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias then this is all for naught.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

(Photo: BuildEx Modular)\nA modular housing manufacturing company is moving into Lincoln County, investing $23.3 million to retrofit an existing facility and promising to create 110 new jobs.\nBuildEx Modular-Tennessee’s facility in Fayetteville will expand the company’s capacity to produce and distribute modular housing units under its MODMAX brand to developers and clients in Southern Middle Tennessee, according to a Wednesday announcement.\nLincoln County sits on the Tennessee-Alabama border, north of Huntsville.\nThe company’s offerings include duplexes, fourplexes and small multifamily homes, according to the Modular Building Institute, a nonprofit trade organization where BuildEx Modular is a member.\nThe Southern Middle Tennessee region is among several areas of the state expected to see population growth in coming years. Fayetteville, the largest city in Lincoln County and the county seat, was home to just over 7,000 people at the 2020 U.S. Census.\nAgriculture remains Lincoln County’s largest industry, and the county is one of the state’s major producers of cattle, according to the county’s website. Lincoln County is also home to two distilleries and other manufacturing outfits producing automotive parts, swimming pools, snack foods and more.\nBuildEx Modular-Tennessee CEO Ben Gaxiola said in a Wednesday news release that the company has received a “warm welcome” from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, local and state leadership and the Industrial Development Board of Fayetteville-Lincoln County.\nThe state’s economic development department has not yet released information on incentives offered to the company.\n“At BuildEx Modular-Tennessee LLC (MODMAX), our mission is to create quality jobs while reshaping how America thinks about housing — faster, smarter and more attainable,” Gaxiola said. “We are proud to call Tennessee home and deeply committed to making a positive impact on this community for generations to come.”",
