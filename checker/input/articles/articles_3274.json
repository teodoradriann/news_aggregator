    "title": "Zaluzhnyy outlines three main goals in war against Russia in 2024 - LB.ua news portal",
    "text": "Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyy in his article for [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/opinions/ukraine-army-chief-war-strategy-russia-valerii-zaluzhnyi/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3B_d9MEggxMAQJ39LmoGZEa6Hrlij2c5bs62tLQhsWM1ccFb7psNDLmm8) expressed his vision of important changes in the approaches to warfare and outlined three main goals on which to focus efforts in the war against Russian aggression. Whatever remarkable advances there have been in the fields of aviation, missile technology and space-based assets, for instance, the concept of victory remains unchanged: to destroy the enemy and to capture or liberate territory. \"And yet, each war is unique,\" he noted. \"And there is no greater challenge facing the military commander, in my opinion, than understanding – in good time – how each war is shaped differently. Firstly, by technological progress, which determines the development of weapons and equipment. And, secondly, by political conditions at home and abroad, and the economic environment,\" Zaluzhnyy argued. It is well known by now that a central driver of this war is the development of unmanned weapons systems. Crucially, it is these unmanned systems – such as drones – along with other types of advanced weapons, that provide the best way for Ukraine to avoid being drawn into a positional war, where we do not possess the advantage. But while mastery of such technologies is key, it is not the only factor influencing current strategy. We must contend with a reduction in military support from key allies, grappling with their own political tensions. Our partners’ stocks of missiles, air defense interceptors and ammunition for artillery is becoming exhausted, due to the intensity of hostilities in Ukraine, but also from a global shortage of propellant charges. Russia, taking note of how developments in the Middle East have distracted international attention, might seek to provoke further conflicts elsewhere. \"The weakness of the international sanctions’ regime means Russia, in partnership with certain others, is still able to deploy its military-industrial complex in pursuit of a war of attrition against us,\" Zaluzhnyy said. \"We must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by the enemy in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures.\" According to Zaluzhnyy, perhaps the number one priority here is mastery of an entire arsenal of (relatively) cheap, modern and highly effective, unmanned vehicles and other technological means. Already such assets allow commanders to monitor the situation on the battlefield in real time, day and night, and in all weather conditions. But not only that. They provide real-time intelligence allowing the adjustment of fire around the clock, without pause – giving us the ability to deliver high-precision strikes against enemy targets in forward positions and in depth. In short, this means nothing less than the wholesale redesign of battlefield operations – and the abandoning of outdated, stereotypical thinking. For the time being, the priority remains improving the situation on the battlefield. And here, technology boasts an undoubted superiority over tradition.",

    "text": "As temperatures rise, it's time to prepare for the season with practical tips and expert advice. From keeping cool and hydrated to maintaining your fitness and exploring the latest in aesthetic services, experts at Aster Clinics cover everything you need to thrive during the summer months.\nBeat the Heat: Stay Hydrated\nStaying hydrated is crucial during the sweltering UAE summer says Dr Nevra Batur, Specialist Family Medicine at Aster Xpress Clinic, Jumeirah Beach Residence. Dehydration can lead to heat exhaustion and other health issues, so it's crucial to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Include hydrating beverages like fresh juices, milkshakes, and yoghurt drinks in your diet to keep your hydration levels up.\nAvoid sugary and caffeinated drinks that can dehydrate you. Always carry a reusable water bottle to ensure you have access to water wherever you go. Remember, staying cool and hydrated helps you beat the heat and enjoy the summer to its fullest!\nSurvive the Sun: Managing Extreme Temperatures\nDr Grace Fabrizia Graziani, Specialist Family Medicine at Aster Royal Clinic, Arabian Ranches says that the UAE summer can bring extreme temperatures, making it vital to take precautions. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours between 10 AM and 4 PM. Use a high-SPF sunscreen and reapply it every two hours.\nShe adds by saying to wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses to shield yourself from harmful UV rays. Seek shade whenever possible and be aware of signs of heat-related illnesses such as dizziness, nausea, and excessive sweating.\nAster Clinics offers IV vitamin drip therapies that deliver fluids directly into the veins. IV Vitamin Drips treat a wide variety of conditions like dehydration and boost immunity, recovery, energy and overall well-being.\nStay Active: Avoid Summer Weight Gain\nSummer can be a challenging time to maintain your fitness routine, but staying active is crucial to avoid weight gain says Dr Ajitkumar Ratnakaran Menon, Specialist Family Medicine at Aster Clinic, Al Qusais (Damascus Street). Engage in early morning or late evening outdoor activities like jogging, swimming, or cycling when temperatures are cooler.\nConsider indoor options such as gym workouts, fitness classes, or home exercise routines. Staying active not only helps you maintain a healthy weight but also boosts your energy levels and mood. Incorporate fun and varied fitness activities into your routine to stay motivated and fit this summer.\nSmooth and Silky: Laser Hair Removal for Summer\nLaser hair removal is a popular choice for achieving smooth, hair-free skin during the summer says Dr Hanaa Gasem Mergeny Mohamed, Specialist Dermatology and Cosmetology at Aster Clinic, Fujairah. This procedure targets hair follicles with laser energy, reducing hair growth over time. It is effective in various areas, including the legs, arms, underarms, and bikini line.\nIf you are planning for a vacation and beach-ready body laser hair removal is the option for you! The treatment is quick and relatively painless, making it a convenient option for those looking to minimise hair removal routines. Schedule your sessions well in advance of your summer plans to ensure optimal results. Enjoy the confidence of silky-smooth skin all season long.\nGlow and Renew: Transform Skin with Chemical Peels\nChemical peels are an effective way to exfoliate and revitalise your skin, reducing the signs of ageing, sun damage, and pigmentation, a risk that comes with peak summer says Dr Muneer Mohamed, Specialist Dermatology and Cosmetology at Aster Clinic, Al Muteena (Deira). They work by gently removing the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath.\nThe extreme summers in the UAE can cause massive skin damage. Skin resurfacing with a chemical peel can restore the youthful appearance of the ageing face, neck, and hands. Healthcare professionals frequently use chemical peels for both therapeutic and cosmetic purposes to enhance facial skin's appearance, whether utilised independently or combined with other approaches such as laser treatment or dermabrasion.\nSummer Skin Bliss: Summer Facial Treatments\nWhether you're dealing with sun damage, or dryness, or simply want to enhance your natural radiance, our expert facial treatments offer the perfect solution says Dr Ankita Tuknayat, Specialist Dermatology and Cosmetology at Aster Clinic, Sheikh Zayed Road. These facials are specifically designed to combat the effects of the intense summer heat and keep your complexion glowing.\nHydraFacial: Experience the gentle HydraFacial treatment, which uses an exfoliation tip and suction pump to remove dead skin cells, leaving your face revitalised and refreshed.\nOxygen Facial: Enjoy a resurfacing procedure that leaves your skin glowing. High-pressure oxygen and nourishing serums are sprayed onto your skin, promoting collagen production and enhancing circulation.\nPlatelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy: Rejuvenate your skin with PRP therapy, where skilled practitioners inject platelet-rich plasma to stimulate collagen production and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.\nThese treatments are designed to keep your skin radiant and healthy all summer long!\nBoost Your Glow: Summer Skin Booster Injections\nEnhance your skin's radiance and hydration with Skin Booster Injections, perfect for combating the harsh effects of the summer sun says Dr Loai Gaffer Ahmed Ali, Specialist Dermatology and Cosmetology at Aster Clinic, Ras Al Khaimah. These innovative treatments work deep within the skin to restore moisture, improve texture, and enhance your natural glow, ensuring your skin stays refreshed and rejuvenated even in the hottest months.\nIntense Hydration: These injections infuse your skin with hyaluronic acid, a powerful hydrator that retains moisture and keeps your skin plump and supple.\nImproved Texture: By stimulating collagen production, Skin Booster Injections help smooth fine lines and improve overall skin texture, giving you a youthful glow.\nLong-Lasting Results: Unlike topical treatments, skin boosters work from within, providing lasting hydration and radiance throughout the summer months.\nHome Skincare Secrets for a Cool Summer\nMaintaining healthy skin during the scorching summer months in the UAE is crucial. Here are some essential tips shared by Dr Juwariya Tasneem Syeda, Specialist Dermatology and Cosmetology at Aster Clinic, Bur Dubai (AJMC) to keep your skin comfortable, protected, and glowing:\nHydrate Your Skin by drinking plenty of water, using a lightweight and hydrating moisturiser and hydrating serums with hyaluronic acid.\nSun Protection by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen (>SPF 30), reapplying it every two hours, and wearing protective clothing, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses to shield your skin from harmful UV rays.\nGentle Cleansing twice a day using a gentle, sulphate-free cleanser to remove sweat, dirt, and sunscreen without stripping your skin’s natural oils.\nExfoliate Skin 1-2 times a week using a mild exfoliant to remove dead skin cells and prevent clogged pores.\nLightweight Makeup like a tinted moisturiser with SPF that is non-comedogenic for a natural, glowing look allowing your skin to breathe.\nCooling Skincare Products with soothing ingredients like aloe vera, cucumber, and chamomile to calm and cool your skin.\nTreat Sun Damage by applying after-sun products with ingredients like aloe vera and vitamin E and consider laser treatments or light-based therapies to address sun damage and pigmentation issues.\nMaintain a Healthy Diet:\nConsume a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals to support your skin's health.\nInclude hydrating foods like watermelon, cucumber, and leafy greens in your diet.\nBy following these summer essentials, you can keep your overall body comfortable, protected, and healthy throughout the hot UAE summer.

La herramienta del servicio de pagos no es exactamente nueva, ya que el Banco de México la lanzó hace un año, aunque celebró que ya tiene 7 millones de cuenta registradas. Victoria Rodríguez Ceja, gobernadora del Banco de México, había anunciado que Dimo es para el Sistema de Pagos Electrónicos Interbancarios, mejor conocido como SPEI, en el que están inscritas 19 instituciones financieras.

Banco de México tiene este servicio de pagos con millones de usuarios Con la intención de facilitar la vida de sus ahora millones de usuarios, el Banco de México creó Dimo (Dinero Móvil), un servicio de pagos pensada para las transferencias electrónicas con el formato SPEI. ¿Qué es Dimo? Como explicó el Banco de México, el servicio de pago permite que los usuarios realicen transferencias bancarias SPEI, pero no se necesitarán datos como la CLABE interbancaria o la fotografía de la tarjeta. Y es que Dimo está pensada para fomentar las transferencias electrónicas de manera rápida, ya que solamente deberás dar tu número telefónico, una vez que esté asociado en tu banco. Es decir, con Dimo en lugar de que pases el número de tarjeta o CLABE, solamente deberás dar tu número de teléfono al hacer una transferencia electrónica, todo esto bajo el formato SPEI. Respecto a las obligaciones del banco con Dimo, deberá avisar la vinculación de su número celular, cerciorarse que se efectúa en el dispositivo con la línea de telefonía a asociar, además de avisar a sus usuarios sobre los movimientos.

El Banco de México te lo explica Igualmente, el Banco de México te explica cómo funciona Dimo y cómo asociar tu número de celular para recibir transferencias bancarias y estos son los pasos: - solicitar directamente al banco ya sea en sucursal o mediante su app, utilizando el número de celular a asociar - el banco notificará al usuario y en un plazo no mayor a un día hábil, se dará la recepción - tras la notificación, se podrá recibir transferencias Sin embargo, para que otra persona te pueda hacer una transferencia mediante Dimo, se deberá de dar de alta su número de celular también. Para hacerlo mediante la aplicación de tu banco, los pasos para asociar tu número y así realizar transferencias SPEI con Dimo pueden variar. Sin embargo, solamente se permite asociar tu número de teléfono a una cuenta por banco, aunque el mismo puede ser asociado en varias instituciones. Por ejemplo, si tienes una cuenta en Banamex, Banorte y una tercera en BBVA, puedes utilizar el mismo celular para los tres bancos con Dimo.",
