    "text": "HERMISTON, Ore. -A Hermiston High School student has won the Congressional App Challenge for their app to help diagnose car repairs.\nYahir Conejo-Garcia was notified by the Office of Oregon Senator Cliff Bentz that he is the winner for Oregon's Second District.\n\"Yahir worked extremely hard on this app,” said Hermiston High School Computer Science Teacher Robert Theriault.\nConejo-Garcia's app can be used to narrow down the problems with a car to a specific issue, according to a press release from Hermiston High .\nAfter identifying the problem, the app then instructs the user how to check the issue and further repair it. If the problem requires a part from an auto store, the app can access the user's location via Google maps and direct them to nearby auto parts stores.\n“I remember him trying to decide how to handle all the data he needed for the app,\" said Theriault. \"Since we hadn’t learned a database language yet, he was able to research other methods to store all his data and landed on using JavaScript objects instead. His determination to make the app work is commendable.\"\nThe Congressional App Challenge is held annually to inspire students in STEM, coding and computer science.",

    "title": "Netanyahu arrives in US for key speech declaring Israel will continue fighting Hezbollah with 'full force'",
    "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will keep hitting Lebanese armed group Hezbollah with \"full force\" until residents in the north of Israel can go back to their homes safely. \"We will not stop until we achieve all our goals, first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes,\" he said. The Israeli prime minister made the remarks after landing in New York on Wednesday, local time, ahead of his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. Mr Netanyahu's speech is expected to focus on the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and the future trajectory of the two, amid growing international pressure on Israel to strike a ceasefire deal with both Hamas and Hezbollah. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations are being held across New York protesting against his appearance at the UN. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel rejected 12 countries' calls for a ceasefire with Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border. Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement making it clear the government had rejected the proposal entirely, also effectively disagreeing with its biggest ally, the United States. \"The prime minister instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force, and according to the plans presented to him,\" part of it read. \"Likewise, the fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the goals of the war are achieved.\" France, which was amongst the signatories to the joint statement, said it was opposed to Lebanon becoming a new Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron speaking in Montreal on Thursday said he did not think Mr Netanyahu's rejection of the proposed ceasefire was definitive, and that he would seek to persuade the Israeli prime minister to stop the strikes. Israeli military preparing for 'ground maneuver' The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have struck about 220 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in the past day, the military said on Thursday. \"The IDF is continuing to operate to degrade and dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,\" it said in a statement. It said that among the targets that were struck were infrastructure sites, launchers from which projectiles were fired toward Israeli territory, Hezbollah operatives and weapons storage facilities in Lebanon. This included attacks on the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Lebanon's health ministry said at least 28 people had died overnight and during Thursday by Israeli air strikes. A strike also killed the head of one of Hezbollah's air force units, Mohammad Surur, two security sources said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations hitting the group's top ranks. Israel's military chief said earlier on Wednesday the I[DF was preparing for a \"possible entry\" into Lebanon by land](/news/2024-09-26/israeli-military-chief-ground-operations-in-lebanon-possible/104397906). Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said late on Thursday aerial units were planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran. \"We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with Northern Command for a ground maneuver. Prepared, if activated. This is a decision to be made above us,\" he told soldiers, in a video distributed by the IDF. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes during the heaviest Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since a major war in 2006, and more than 600 have been killed since Monday. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of missiles at targets in Israel including its commercial hub Tel Aviv, although Israel's aerial defence system has ensured that the damage has been limited. Israeli fighter jets on Thursday also hit infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel's military said. Palestinian president urges UN to stop war in Gaza Hezbollah, which is closely tied with Hamas, has refused to stop retaliating against Israel unless it ceased attacking the Gaza Strip. Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged the UN to take stronger action. \"This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people,\" he said. Mr Abbas called for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, an end to attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza and a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the enclave. \"We refuse the establishment of buffer zones or taking any part from Gaza,\" he said. \"We will not allow a single centimetre of Gaza to be taken. \"The State of Palestine must shoulder its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and impose its full mandate on it and jurisdiction on it, including the border checkpoints, especially the Rafah international border.\" He said that the Palestinian Authority, which he leads, should have control over all Palestinian territories and that it would hold elections once the war is over. Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon responded to Mr Abbas's speech in a statement, accusing him of only talking about a peaceful solution when he is at the United Nations and failing to condemn the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that triggered the war in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The US, Qatar and Egypt have been trying unsuccessfully to broker a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Washington still seeks ceasefire The White House said that discussions are continuing for a 21-day ceasefire and US and Israeli officials would hold talks in New York on Thursday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to meet with Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. In London, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned there was a risk of all-out war in the Middle East, but a diplomatic solution was still possible. \"So let me be clear, Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path, despite the sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable,\" Mr Austin said.

Sin embargo, existen plantas con ciertos aromas desagradables para los mosquitos que pueden ayudar a ahuyentarlos y mantenerlos alejados de la casa. Desde hace ya un tiempo se utilizan repelentes con aceites esenciales derivados de plantas como alternativa a los repelentes químicos. La citronela (Cymbopogon nardus) es la planta más utilizada para ahuyentar los mosquitos , ya que tiene un alto contenido cítrico y además no requiere muchos cuidados. El aceite esencial de esta planta se suele utilizar en velas, espirales y en repelentes caseros. También existen otras opciones de especies aromáticas para ahuyentar a los mosquitos y que se pueden poner en el jardín, balcón, cantero, o incluso cerca de las ventanas.

    "text": "MADRID, 10 Ene. (Portaltic/EP) -\n Meta ha entrenado al menos uno de sus modelos de lenguaje de gran tamaño (LLM, por sus siglas en inglés) con obras protegidas con derechos de autor mediante el recurso de una biblioteca con contenidos pirateados.\n Library Genesis o LibGen es un motor de búsqueda que facilita el acceso a obras impresas, como novelas, cómics o artículos científicos, que ha sido denunciado en numerosas ocasiones por infringir los derechos de autor.\n Se vio obligado a cerrar su dominio en Estados Unidos por orden judicial en 2015, y también ha sido bloqueado en varios países europeos, pero sigue estando disponible mediante dominios alternativos.\n A partir de este motor de búsqueda, Meta ha entrenado al menos uno de los LLM Llama con obras pirateadas, como se recoge en nuevos documentos no redactados presentados ante el Tribunal de Distrito de los Estados Unidos para el Distrito Norte de California.\n Estos documentos respaldan la denuncia interpuesta por el novelista Richard Kadrey contra Meta por infracción de derechos de autor, y recogen el testimonio de un representante corporativo que testificó en noviembre de 2024, en el que se reconoce el uso de LibGen.\n Según los documentos, fue el director ejecutivo, Mark Zuckerberg, quien autorizó el uso de este motor de búsqueda para descargar obras mediante torrent con las que entrenar su modelos, pese a las preocupaciones de miembros del equipos de Meta AI.\n En concreto, Meta retiró la información de derechos de autor de la base de datos de LibGen, precisamente la que contiene material pirateado de editoriales como Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill y Pearson Education.\n También eliminó de artículos científicos los párrafos con derechos de autor y la fuente de los metadatos de los datos de entrenamiento de Llama, incluida la información sobre gestión de derechos de autor (CMI, por sus siglas en inglés), como el signo de la 'c' que indica copyright, lo que facilitó el entrenamiento, pero también evitó que saltaran las alarmas entre los usuarios del modelo si aparecía dicho contenido en las interacciones.\nUna investigación de The New York Times, publicada en abril del año pasado, reveló que Meta, así como Google y OpenAI, entrenaban sus modelos con contenidos procedentes de Internet , incluidos vídeos procedentes de YouTube.\nLeer más acerca de:",

    "text": "Se va Manlio Herrera\nManlio Herrera Chagoya, quien se desempeñaba como líder interino del Sindicato Único de Trabajadores al Servicio del Poder Ejecutivo del Estado de Hidalgo (SUTSPEEH), renunció al cargo. El anuncio fue dado ante una base trabajadora que desde hace meses exigía su salida al considerarlo un líder ilegítimo, impuesto sin un proceso de elección. Entre pancartas y rechiflas, los trabajadores expresaron su rechazo y exigieron una renovación democrática del sindicato. Por su parte, el gobernador Julio Menchaca confirmó la renuncia y reconoció que, aunque Manlio Herrera colaboró en el proceso de renovación, los liderazgos sindicales también enfrentan desgaste. En ese sentido, aseguró que la próxima dirigencia será elegida mediante un proceso democrático, conforme a la ley y con apego a las recientes reformas laborales que garantizan elecciones libres y transparentes. Sin embargo, persiste la desconfianza entre la base que, dijeron, temen que nuevamente se imponga un dirigente.\nFestival Internacional del Folklore\nPor primera vez el Festival Internacional del Folklore de Hidalgo, podría no realizarse en Tulancingo, al parecer no se ha logrado el acuerdo de apoyos entre el director, Alejandro Camacho y la alcaldesa Lorena García. Al respecto la presidenta municipal señaló que no hay inconveniente en que se lleve el proyecto con más de 25 años de historia a otro municipio.\nDeportaciones\nPese al endurecimiento del discurso y las políticas antimigrantes de la administración de Donald Trump en Estados Unidos, las deportaciones de hidalguenses disminuyeron 29.2 por ciento en el primer trimestre de 2025, en comparación con el mismo periodo del año anterior. Según datos del Centro Nacional de Monitoreo de Movilidad y Migración Internacional (Cenammmi), 829 personas originarias de Hidalgo fueron repatriadas entre enero y marzo, frente a las mil 172 registradas en 2024. A nivel nacional, la tendencia también fue a la baja, con una disminución del 35.8 por ciento en deportaciones: de 47 mil 659 en 2024 a 30 mil 565 este año. La mayoría de los repatriados fueron hombres adultos, y los principales puntos de recepción en México fueron Baja California, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Chihuahua y Sonora por vía terrestre; mientras que Yucatán, Jalisco y Estado de México recibieron retornados por vía aérea. En 2024, Hidalgo cerró el año con 4 mil 927 connacionales deportados.\nComisión de Atención a Víctimas\nEl gobernador Julio Menchaca envió al Congreso local la terna de candidatas para dirigir la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas (Ceavih), vacante desde el 28?de?abril; la integran Janet?García?Rodríguez, experta en litigación penal y violencia de género; Luisa?Yuriley?Gonzaga?Ramírez, directiva de la CEI3 con experiencia en estrategias institucionales; y Blanca?Rojas?Ponciano, abogada y trabajadora social especializada en derechos humanos. Seleccionadas por el Comité Técnico de Evaluación tras la convocatoria pública de mayo, sus perfiles serán analizados por las comisiones de Gobernación, Seguridad Ciudadana y Justicia, y Derechos Humanos del Congreso, que emitirán un dictamen para ser votado en el Pleno, definiendo así a la próxima titular de la Ceavih y el rumbo de la política estatal de atención a víctimas.",

    "text": "Foto: Punto Corte\nWashington, 13 oct (RHC) El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, visitará hoy Florida para evaluar personalmente los daños que provocó Milton, huracán que tocó tierra allí con categoría 3 y dejó a su paso 16 muertos y graves afectaciones materiales.\nEl huracán, que modificó levemente su trayectoria más al sur y entró la noche del miércoles en Siesta Key, cerca de la ciudad de Sarasota, tuvo vientos máximos sostenidos de 205 kilómetros por hora.\nBiden dijo el viernes en una reunión informativa en la Casa Blanca que a más de 50 mil millones de dólares ascienden los daños materiales del fenómeno hidrometeorológico en Florida.\nEn el encuentro, donde también participó la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, examinaron la respuesta de la administración demócrata y la recuperación federal tras los huracanes Milton (9 de octubre) y Helene (26 de septiembre).\nEl mandatario prometió la ayuda necesaria a los damnificados para que puedan recuperarse y agregó que un equipo de 50 mil linieros logró restablecer el servicio eléctrico a cerca de un millón de clientes, pero los reportes indican que todavía alrededor de otro millón sigue a oscuras.\nSin dudas, los dos huracanes consecutivos alteraron las agendas de Harris y del candidato republicano, el expresidente Donald Trump, quienes dedicaron parte de sus últimos días a abordar preguntas sobre el esfuerzo de recuperación ante estos devastadores eventos.\nMilton cruzó de oeste a este la península de Florida. Salió al Atlántico la mañana del jueves con categoría 1, pero atrás las imágenes eran dantescas.\nAunque no generó el peor escenario previsto por los meteorólogos, el impacto de Milton ha sido tremendo, especialmente en el centro y sur del estado, donde una ola de tornados asociados al sistema ocasionaron la mayoría de las muertes registradas.",
