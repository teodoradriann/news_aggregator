    "text": "For those who appreciate a good cocktail, this holiday season offers patrons a mix of caffeine and alcohol – including energy drinks, as well as coffee-flavored liquor and beer.\nJaxon Blunt, a bartender at Kroner and Baer Pub, said besides holiday drinks like the Yippe-Ki-Yay Moscow Mule with cranberry juice, thyme and Tito's vodka, cocktails featuring coffee-flavored vodka are popular.\n\"We also have a coffee bock beer that's pretty popular, made by Rose Rock Coffee,\" Blunt said. \"The same guy who does the coffee has a brewery.\"\nA post on Kroner's Facebook page states the beer is \"triple local\" and brewed by Downing Brewery, using Rose Rock Coffee.\nTera Webb and her husband James Webb, said on Dec. 21 that they had just come from Emery's Grill, taking advantage of that restaurant's Saturday brunch specials, and then went to Kroner's for drinks.\n\"They do a great mimosa at Kroner, and James loves Red Bull and vodka,\" Tera said. \"We love coffee vodka; this weekend was James' birthday and we made a shot out of coffee vodka and chocolate Baileys [Irish Cream] – it made a killer shot.\"\nAt the Squeeze Inn, Brendan Barlow said hot chocolate and coffee, with alcohol added, is one of the preferred choices this year.\nEggnog with a shot of liquor is always a favorite of the season, and Barlow said he heard on an NPR report that when making homemade eggnog, the alcohol should be added to the egg mixture before the cream, which purportedly makes it safer because it kills any bacteria in the eggs.\n\"Red Bull is back and that's weird to me; when I was working [as a bartender] in 2010, Red Bull with vodka was so popular at that point it was called an RBV,\" Barlow said.\nFlavored alcohol is popular, like Jose Cuervo's Devil's Reserve pineapple and mango combinations, and \"are kind of fun.\" Flavored vodkas are sweeter alcohols and most like it combined with some kind of soda, or combining two flavors of the liquor – like vanilla and blueberry, Barlow said.\n\"The most popular vodka is Tito's; Oklahoma has a love-hate affair with Texas and it's a Texas product,\" Barlow said.\nHe pointed out that the bottle for Stoli's used to have more Russian script on it, and the brand featured the whole name – Stolichnaya Vodka – but now it just says \"Stoli Vodka,\" Barlow said.\n\"It just says imported from Latvia; [Russia] is obviously not a popular topic to bring up,\" Barlow said.\nIn March 2022, the company that produces this vodka rebranded it because the owner of the company has been a critic of President Vladimir Putin, states an NPR article.\n\"Exiled Russian-born billionaire Yuri Shefler, who owns the company that produces the vodka, has been a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin for decades,\" states an article on NPR titled, \"Stolichnaya Vodka rebrands as 'Stoli,' trying to distance itself from Putin,\" published March 22, 2022.\nIn recent years, the vodka has been produced in Latvia by the Luxembourg-based Stoli Group, states the article.\nHannah Trude, bartender and server at Linney Breaux's Cajun Eatery, serves a smoky old-fashioned, with a hand-cut, round, crystal-cut piece of ice.\nThe ingredients are Bulleit bourbon, bitters, a \"Luxardo Maraschino\" cherry, simple syrup and finished off with smoke using maple wood chips in a handheld smoker, Trude said.\n\"And always stirred, never shaken,\" Trude said. \"I'm pretty sure James Bond said something like that.\"\nCo-owner of Linney Breaux's, Mike Linney, said Trude makes one of the best old-fashioneds \"in America.\" She travels to different places to learn more about making cocktails, he said.\nLinney said the most popular drink at his restaurant is the smoky old-fashioned, and Trude said people are also ordering martini's and mules.\n\"There are different versions of mules – the Moscow Mule, Dark and Stormy, and our own mule that has spiced rum in it – Kickin' Cajun Mule – with cayenne,\" Trude said. \"And our spiked eggnog is popular – the eggnog is homemade.\"",

    "text": "MLHS Class of 2025 steps out into the world\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake High School Class of 2025 celebrated a milestone Tuesday evening as 386 graduates participated in the commencement ceremony held at the school’s stadium.\nThe air was filled with excitement and pride as families and friends gathered to honor the achievements of the graduating class, marking the completion of their high school journey.\nPrincipal Sheila Kries opened the ceremony, reflecting on the unique challenges faced by students over the past few years, particularly during the pandemic.\n“When you arrived at Moses Lake High School as ninth graders, I was your assistant principal,” she said. “I fondly recall interacting with you and the memorable chaos that ensued as the school reopened post-COVID.”\nHer remarks served as a reminder of the resilience and adaptability the students demonstrated throughout their high school years.\nThe commencement featured two student speakers, Julia Heaps and Hayden Meek, who shared their reflections and experiences. Heaps, an accomplished student set to attend Columbia University, emphasized the importance of seeing beyond stereotypes.\n“Don’t settle for a single story, not about people, not about places and not about yourself,” she urged her classmates. “Be curious, not judgmental.”\nHayden Meek, acknowledging the challenges the class faced in their senior year, paid tribute to the support systems that helped the students persevere.\n“I also want to thank my closest friends who helped me with this speech,” he said. “Reach out, whether you’re grieving a loss or just not feeling like yourself. You’re not alone. Everyone goes through hard times.”\nSuperintendent Carol Lewis reinforced the significance of graduation.\n“This accomplishment is the beginning of an opportunity for you to go out into communities near and far to share your amazing talents,” Lewis said.\nShe expressed gratitude for the staff and community members who supported the students, especially during the school’s financial challenges last year.\nAs the 79th graduating class of Moses Lake High School, the Class of 2025 now steps into a world filled with possibilities, leaving behind cherished memories and embracing new opportunities to thrive in their future endeavors.",

    "text": "Please bring Linux back..\n@devs, super please bring back the Linux support/version (for residential/individual/family versions) >.< Both my wife and I have migrated from Windows to Linux since earlier this year and there's no looking back. I may run my Windows disk as/thru a VM, but hardly ever, and am either on Linux Mint (debian/Ubuntu based) basically all the time with a rare exception. Plus, with the continuing rise of people switching to Linux has and only will be going up and up as more people use it for handheld gaming (like the Steam Deck) and ESPECIALLY with Microsoft and all their Co-Pilot and Windows Recall crap that I bet we all are aware of by now and they are just proving more and more that they are very untrustworthy and naive or maybe aren't telling us the whole story/motive. I, almost each/every day (and sometimes multiple times), hear another friend(s) or people in an online community I'm apart of (am apart of many) has migrated to Linux of some sort.\nThe Demand is there and is only rising and will continue to do so. I basically never even use the product anymore running 3+ machines on Linux, I don't really have a reason to keep my subscription anymore when it's up for renewal if it stays like this I hate to say.. :/ I love you guys and your product(s) so very very much and you guys do a great job whenever you do something.\ntl;dr: Plz re-add Linux support, need/demand is only going up and up.\nComments\n-\nI have moved your post to the \"Product features and Ideation\" category, where it will automatically be shared with the Bitdefender developers.\nRegards\nLife happens, Coffee helps!\nShow your Attitude, when you reach that Altitude!\nBitdefender Ultimate Security Plus (user)\n0",
