    "text": "2023-12-27 06:24:00 Returning from injury, Victor Wembanyama was unable to prevent the Spurs’ defeat against the Utah Jazz (118-130) on Tuesday December 26. Hit in the ankle before Christmas, the Frenchman posted a mixed performance with 15 points scored and 7 rebounds collected. Established as the pivot, Wembanyama started the match with a 3-point basket then a block on Kelly Olynyk, followed by an acrobatic alley-oop. To which were added 2 rebounds and 2 assists, all in 5 minutes. Rarely since the start of the season have we seen such ball movement in favor of the Frenchman. At the break, the Spurs, behind on the scoreboard (60-64), did not benefit from the efficiency of the interior (2.24m), with 10 points scored in 11 minutes. Afterwards, the Jazz adjusted, defended themselves better against Wembanyama, entrusting their best offensive player Lauri Markannen (31 points) with the task of reducing the influence of the Frenchman. A success. Wembanyama played 13 minutes in the second act but his effectiveness waned (2/7 on shots). “More consistency for some of my players” His teammates did not seem to be able to take over, the outcome could only be another defeat. A setback that annoyed legendary San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. “It’s time to ask some of my players for more consistency. Otherwise, I will be forced to make changes,” he said. READ ALSO Basketball: Victor Wembanyama, first choice playerThe French player, drafted in first position last June, regularly displays certain qualities (18.5 points and 11 rebounds on average). The interior, however, has not yet found the key to relaunching the very young franchise. San Antonio has a string of setbacks, and has a largely negative record of 4 wins for 25 losses, making the Spurs the worst team in the Western Conference. The Texans will have a double confrontation to play before the end of 2023, against the penultimate Portland, on December 29 and 30. #Victor #Wembanyama #Spurs #lose",

    "text": "Tiempo\nAEMET alerta de precipitaciones \"engelantes\" en estas zonas de Castilla y León\nAdemás se prevén nieblas nocturnas\nEl frío sigue dejando helados a los castellanos y leoneses. Las temperaturas bajo cero de las últimas jornadas continuarán, e incluso aumentarán en las próximas horas como consecuencia de las precipitaciones \"engelantes\" que se esperan en algunas zonas de Castilla y León, según ha alertado la Agencia Estatal de Metereología (AEMET) para este viernes 3 de enero. Según señala Wikipedia, la lluvia engelante o lluvia gélida es un tipo de precipitación que comienza a caer desde las nubes a la superficie en forma de nieve, a grandes alturas, se derrite completamente mientras cae cuando atraviesa una capa de aire sobre la temperatura de congelación (0 °C), y luego encuentra una segunda capa inferior a más bajos niveles de temperatura que la primera, sobrefusionándose. Esta agua entonces se congelará al impactarse en cualquier objeto que encuentre, pudiendo el hielo acumularse hasta varios centímetros, mediante la forma de hielo glaseado.\nAdemás AEMET anuncia cielos nubosos o cubiertos, con precipitaciones débiles en el tercio norte, más frecuentes en zonas de montaña, probabilidad de ellas, aunque más ocasionales, e incluso algunas en forma de nieve. También existe en Castilla y León la probabilidad de brumas y nieblas, sobre todo de madrugada, más seguras en el norte y este, así como heladas débiles en el sureste y en zonas dispersas del resto. Vientos del suroeste, flojos.\nEn lo que se refiere a las temperaturas, AEMET prevé mínimas en ascenso y máximas en ascenso o sin cambios. En las ciudades los termómetros oscilarán entre los -1 grados de Ávila, Segovia y Soria; los 1 de Burgos y León; los dos de Salamanca y Valladolid; y los tres grados de Palencia y Zamora.\nEn cuanto a las máximas las temperaturas en las capitales de provincia se situarán entre los seis grados de Burgos y León; los siete de Soria; los ocho de Segovia; los nueve de Palencia y Valladolid; y los 11 grados de Ávila, Salamanca y Zamora.",

    "text": "An interdisciplinary collaboration between Northwestern University and Georgia Tech has created a novel high-performance organic electrochemical neuron that responds within the frequency range of human neurons. The researchers also built a complete perception system by designing other organic materials and integrating their engineered neurons with artificial touch receptors and synapses, which enabled real-time tactile signal sensing and processing.\nThe background Artificially engineered biological processes, such as perception systems, have been an elusive target for organic electronics experts due to the reliance of human senses on an adaptive network of sensory neurons, which communicate by firing in response to environmental stimuli.\nWhy it matters The research, described in a paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could move the needle on intelligent robots and other systems currently stymied by sensing systems that are less powerful than those of a human.\n“The study highlights significant progress in organic electronics and their application in bridging the gap between biology and technology,” said first author Yao Yao , a Northwestern engineering professor. “We created an efficient artificial neuron with reduced footprint and outstanding neuronal characteristics. Leveraging this capability, we developed a complete tactile neuromorphic perception system to mimic real biological processes.”\n‘Outstanding’ characteristics According to corresponding author Tobin J. Marks , Northwestern’s Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, existing artificial neural circuits tend to fire within a narrow frequency range.\n“The synthetic neuron in this study achieves unprecedented performance in firing frequency modulation, offering a range 50 times broader than existing organic electrochemical neural circuits,” Marks said. “In contrast, our device’s outstanding neuronal characteristics establish it as an advanced achievement in organic electrochemical neurons.”\nMarks is a world leader in the fields of organometallic chemistry, chemical catalysis, materials science, organic electronics, photovoltaics and nanotechnology. He is also a professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering in Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering and a Professor of Applied Physics.\n“This study presents the first complete neuromorphic tactile perception system based on artificial neurons, which integrates artificial tactile receptors and artificial synapses,” said corresponding author Antonio Facchetti , a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Materials Science and Engineering and an adjunct professor of chemistry at Northwestern. “It demonstrates the ability to encode tactile stimuli into spiking neuronal signals in real time and further translate them into post-synaptic responses.”\nWhat’s next With the human brain’s immense network of 86 billion neurons poised to fire, sensing systems remain difficult to recreate. Scientists are limited by both the footprint of the design and by the amount they can create. In future models, the team hopes to further reduce the device’s size, taking the project a step closer to fully mimicking human sensing systems.\nStory posted on Northwestern Now , written by Win Reynolds .",

    "text": "El CA Osasuna eliminó (2-3) al Athletic Club este jueves para avanzar a cuartos de final de la Copa del Rey a costa del vigente campeón.\nEl equipo 'rojillo' asaltó San Mamés con la pegada de Ante Budimir y las paradas de Sergio Herrera. El delantero croata y el portero español son la combinación letal que todo equipo desea, y Osasuna se bastó con ambos y una apuesta valiente para terminar con la andadura del vigente campeón de Copa.\nLos de Vicente Moreno salieron motivados, con posesión de balón y Herrera ya deteniendo desde el principio las tentativas locales. La mejor fue de Iñaki Williams ya cerca del minuto 40, pero la respuesta fue el 0-1 de Aimar Oroz. Le salió bien la salida en velocidad a Osasuna y, poco después, llegó el 0-2 de penalti.\nBudimir detectó la mala cesión de Aitor Paredes y forzó la pena máxima que él mismo convirtió, muy tocado el Athletic. Con todo, los de Ernesto Valverde se aferraron a San Mamés y a la Copa una vez más para recortar antes del descanso por medio de Nico Williams. Así se encendió la chispa rojiblanca y en el segundo tiempo se sucedieron las ocasiones del Athletic hasta el 2-2 de De Marcos.\nEl campeón atacó con todo pero le faltó la puntería y el acierto que sí tuvo Budimir, que cazó un balón suelto de Julen Agirrezabala para hacer el 2-3 en el minuto 70. El otro héroe 'rojillo', Herrera, terminó sustituido por un fuerte golpe, pero el Athletic no pudo evitar el adiós ante Osasuna como en 2023.\nEnvía tu noticia a: participa@andaluciainformacion.es",

    "text": "Sitting in her home on a leafy street in North West London, Rifka Meyer looks fondly at a framed photograph hanging above her dining room table.\nThe image, taken at her\nwedding, features her now-husband and the nine children — five hers, four his — who now form their blended family.\n\"I'm extremely happily married,\" she says.\nBut she wasn't always.\nMeyer, a devout\nOrthodox Jew, once shared the house with her former husband, her second.\nBy her account, it was a\ndeeply traumatic marriage that left her feeling manipulated, isolated, and a shell of her former self.\nAnd when she tried to leave it, she couldn't.\nTo obtain a religiously accepted separation in Judaism, women require a bill of divorce known as a gett.\nBut they can only be granted by a husband to his wife — and Meyer's husband refused.\nIt was the start of a decade of struggle to end her marriage.\nA traumatic marriage\nMeyer said the marriage was\ncoercive on a number of levels, including financially and emotionally.\n\"He moved into my home with my children and he didn't contribute to anything,\" she said, adding: \"He was also controlling in the aspects of what I wore and who I could speak to. I found myself slowly being cut off from family and friends.\"\nShe was deeply unhappy, a situation compounded by allegations of criminal behavior against her husband, which Business Insider is unable to describe in full for legal reasons.\nIn a message to Business Insider, her former husband, Yossi Elkouby, described the allegations and a consequent conviction as a conspiracy against him.\nMeyer said she resolved to end the marriage in 2011.\nAfter Meyer decided the marriage was over, and with the assistance of the London Beth Din, the central religious authority for\nOrthodox Jews in the United Kingdom, she was able to get her husband out of her house.\nBut when it came to securing the gett, a document in Jewish law that brings about a religious divorce between the couple, Meyer said the Beth Din was hesitant.\n\"They said, 'He's gone through a lot, we've managed to get him out of your house, let the dust settle and then we'll talk about a gett,\" she explained.\nHer husband's refusal left Meyer with few options to\ndissolve the marriage.\nIt rendered her an \"agunah,\" which roughly translates from Hebrew as a \"chained woman.\"\nThat, Meyer said, is an apt description: \"There's a physical feeling of that ball and chain weighing you down.\"\nOr, to put it another way: \"You're technically stuck in a dead relationship with no future,\" she said.\nElkouby claimed to BI that he refused to give Meyer a gett because she was giving him the \"silent treatment.\"\nHe said he wanted to reach a financial settlement through dialogue but she \"stubbornly refused to discuss,\" leading to years of delay.\nElkouby told BI: \"She could have received her gett in no time if she'd cooperated.\"\nBecoming an agunah\nAgunot, the plural of agunah, are women trapped in marriages they want to escape. They are unable to date, remarry, start a family with someone else, or otherwise progress in life while still adhering to Jewish law.\nTheoretically, women like Meyer could obtain a civil divorce and explore these options outside their\nreligion.\nBut it would mean severing ties with their communities, leaving behind their jobs, friends, families, and\nsynagogues.\nFor Meyer, it wasn't even a consideration. She said: \"I am who I am and I'm very secure in where I am in my religiosity.\"\nAfter that, Meyer waited for her husband to have a change of heart. But with every passing week, month, and year, it became clearer that such a change was unlikely.\n\"I suppose it is the last act of control that someone has over their spouse and they can hold that as long as they want,\" she said.\nAfter four years, Meyer got back in touch with the London Beth Din, hoping to find a solution.\nThey told her that they were bound by Jewish law, and had little power to compel her husband, she said.\nA spokesperson for the London Beth Din told Business Insider that \"save for exceptional circumstances\" a gett cannot be forced.\n\"Therefore the suggestion that Dayanim were hesitant in forcing a gett completely misses the point that any gett which is achieved by force is invalid and no use to the recipient,\" he said.\nPublic shaming\nThat left one other option: public shaming.\n\"The Chief Rabbi's office put out a siruv against him, which is a publication about him, ostracizing him from the community,\" Meyer said.\nThe 2016 siruv, which has been reviewed by Business Insider, asked \"communities to be wary of social interactions or entering into business transactions\" with her then-husband.\nIt also urged synagogues to refuse him entry until he granted her a gett.\nAlthough it was a drastic measure — the London Beth Din spokesperson called it \"as strong as any siruv could be\" — Meyer does not think it made much of an impact.\nNevertheless, she believed it would serve to publicly expose her husband's refusal.\nFeeling like she had exhausted all other options, Meyer decided to go further afield. She flew to New York to visit the International Beit Din, an organization established by rabbis to help chained women nullify their marriages.\n\"It was extremely brutal,\" she said of the process. \"I remember crying, really feeling very exhausted from it all.\"\nThe dayanim, or religious judges, spent months deliberating, she said. They reached a conclusion that she could have her marriage annulled, providing her with a document outlining the religious laws used to justify that decision.\n\"It took me a while to digest,\" she said. \"But when I did digest it and told my family and friends, it kind of cut the noose around my neck a little bit.\"\nBut it would only have effect in the US — back in the UK her marriage still stood.\nMeyer showed the document to the London Beth Din, who she said refused to approve an annulment because it would \"set a precedent.\"\nThe London Beth Din denied saying this, telling Business Insider that it does not recognize the International Beit Din and rejected the annulment because there \"were no grounds whatsoever\" for it.\nA novel approach\nHopeless and dejected, feeling let down by the London Beth Din after nine years of waiting, Meyer made a last-ditch attempt to escape her marriage. It worked.\nShe made contact with a British lawyer, Gary Lesin-Davis, who had previously worked with clients seeking getts.\nThe lawyer tried a novel approach — using English law to force her husband's hand.\nLesin-Davis wrote to Meyer's husband telling him that he was breaching UK laws against coercive and controlling behavior.\nThe specific law —\nSection 76 of Britain's Serious Crime Act 2015 — legislates against controlling or coercive behavior in an intimate or family relationship. It carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nmakes it clear that forced marriage is one example of this.\nLesin-Davis told Business Insider that the first response from Meyer's then-husband was \"as you might expect, aggressive.\"\nBut eventually, with the prospect of prison time looming, there was a shift. Lesin-Davis said the then-husband changed his tune in a \"relatively short\" period of time.\n\"Perhaps he took legal advice, I'm not really quite sure,\" he added.\nElkouby gave BI a different account, saying that the timing was coincidental.\nHe didn't take \"much notice\" of Lesin-Davis or the legal threat, and instead granted the gett so he could remarry.\n\"The only way I could get remarried was if I gave a gett, that's why I gave it,' he said.\nIt took effect in September 2020, and Meyer was finally\nunshackled.\n\"I literally felt lighter,\" she recalled. \"I felt like I could breathe and my lungs were now filling at full capacity.\"\nBut for others, it wouldn't be so easy.\nCaroline Moher-Maxwell was refused a gett by her husband Alan Moher. In April 2022, instead of granting the document, Moher went to prison. In a landmark case, he was sentenced to 18 months after pleading guilty to controlling or coercive behavior.\nSince getting her freedom, Meyer has been working to establish her own organization,\nGETToutUK, dedicated to helping agunot in the UK.\nShe said that within the first week, it had 13 women seeking its help. It recently celebrated its third anniversary.\nGETToutUK employs various strategies to aid these women, including sensitivity training for London religious bodies.\nThis led the London Beth Din to incorporate compassionate gestures into the gett process, such as placing tissue boxes in its rooms and asking women if they prefer to be referred to by their married or maiden names, she said.\nGETToutUK has also contributed to the drafting of the\nstatutory guidance in the UK's Domestic Abuse Act which explicitly addresses gett refusal.\nIts work has also expanded to assisting men whose wives refuse to accept a gett.\n'Chained' men\nWhile it is less common, a religious authority may also not provide a gett if the woman refuses to accept it or to be present at the proceedings.\nThis happened to Shmuli Simon, a London-based lawyer.\nThough Simon was never technically a \"chained man,\" because no Jewish courts officially declared his ex-wife a gett-refuser, he spent years trying to extricate himself from his marriage.\nLike Meyer, he felt let down by religious authorities.\n\"My issue is really not with my ex,\" he said. \"My issue was with the inability of the Batei Din to exercise any authority whatsoever.\"\nSimon and Meyer now share more than just a common experience with religious authorities — they share a life together. They married in December last year.\nReflecting on the unexpectedly joyful conclusion to a decade marked by tragedy, Meyer said she hopes her story offers glimmers of hope to people who are currently \"chained\".\n\"I hope it will give faith that it will end, one day, please God, and we will do what we can in order to help that happen,\" she said.\nBusiness Insider",

    "text": "雷速体育8月14日讯 天空体育专家、前拜仁球星哈曼在接受德国《图片报》采访时表示，22岁的乌比格明年还不具备成为拜仁首发的条件，同时建议俱乐部考虑签下经验丰富的多纳鲁马。\n随着新赛季的到来，拜仁慕尼黑的门将位置引发外界高度关注。目前，现役门将诺伊尔（39岁）仍稳居首发门将，而22岁的年轻门将乌比格仅被安排参与部分比赛以积累经验。37岁的乌尔赖希将继续担任替补，合同为期一年。\n真正的悬念在于明年夏天：诺伊尔与乌尔赖希的合同即将到期。而乌比格是否能够顺利接任一号门将位置，哈曼持保留态度。\n他表示：“如果一切顺利，诺伊尔没有遭遇重大伤病，乌比格今年大概只能出战六到七场。关键问题在于，明年他是否已经具备足够的能力让你放心把门交给他。正常情况下，我认为乌比格明年不太可能成为首发门将，这几乎是不可能的。”\n哈曼同时指出，拜仁原本应该争取多纳鲁马，即便他的年薪高达2000万欧元，也值得长期投资。他认为：“门将位置特殊，经验很重要。像多纳鲁马这样的球员，签下他可以保证球队5至6年稳定。”\n此外，哈曼还提到，乌比格曾希望前往美国获得比赛机会，但这一行为在俱乐部内部并不被认可。他提醒：“乌尔比格必须保持耐心，他有天赋，但在慕尼黑担任首发门将绝非易事。”\n至于另一名门将努贝尔（28岁），目前租借至斯图加特至明年夏天，但在拜仁仍有合同至2029年。哈曼评论道：“努贝尔为俱乐部已经花费了不少资金，而他目前长期在外租借。理论上他有能力胜任一号门将，但在外多年，他是否还有兴趣回归仍是未知数。”\n拜仁的门将格局，将成为未来一个赛季以及明年夏天转会窗口的焦点。",
