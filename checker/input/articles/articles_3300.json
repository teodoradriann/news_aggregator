    "text": "The Unhealthiest Foods You Can Order From Panda Express Authentic Chinese food can be quite healthy, according to Lillian Cheung, editorial director of the Nutrition Source at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/traditional-chinese-diets-a-template-for-healthy-eating-habits). \"Many staple foods, such as vegetables, tofu, and seafood, are all linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease,\" she said. \"So are the unsaturated oils (such as canola, soy, or peanut oil) frequently used to prepare Chinese dishes.\" However, [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com/our-food-philosophy) isn't traditional Chinese food. According to the chain itself, \"Our flavors are a combination of Chinese roots with an American taste.\" And, as Deanna Ting points out on [Resy](https://blog.resy.com/2021/01/chinese-american-food-is-its-own-great-cuisine-time-to-love-it-that-way/), American Chinese cuisine is \"'Frankenstein' food: an unholy mashup of all things sticky, sweet, deep-fried, and doused in MSG, jammed into a takeout container.\" That's not to say that everything is bad, however. There are [healthier options to order at Panda Express](https://www.healthdigest.com/1117754/healthier-options-to-order-at-panda-express/). But, there are also certain menu items that you'll want to steer clear of. To learn more, we asked Angel Luk, a Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist who is a co-founder of the websites [Food Mysteries](https://foodmysteries.com) and [Ask the Sports Nutrition Dietitian](https://sportsnutritiondietitian.com) as well as the author of \" [You Can't Out-Train a Bad Diet](https://www.amazon.com/YOU-CANT-OUT-TRAIN-BAD-DIET-ebook/dp/B01NA99A9A/ref=sr_1_2?crid=VQEU392L5QS0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ffg-GveAKujwJwAoWG3ZAHTZG_JLVwBnmEE4JI1gcyqauyohyxN55iq7ZjwDmdFLJhtpWulBoADYIDzcHbK2iOjUbV2sURtqz6NGGZ29dVfdkppBqweigN8qIt04wKkYqj195lWmHlGFQ-5-Oi14xg.LVKEcx6xmtKHh_TvSLu4XCE8VXai8yUE45nuEPiVIS4&dib_tag=se&keywords=you%20can't%20out-train%20a%20bad%20diet&qid=1724783418&sprefix=you%20can't%20out-train%20a%20bad%20diet,aps,477&sr=8-2&tag=staticmedia-healthdigest-20),\" just what the unhealthiest foods are that you can order from Panda Express. Orange Chicken If you're a fan of Panda Express, then you're probably not too surprised that their Orange Chicken took the number one spot on [The Daily Meal](https://www.thedailymeal.com/1503256/ultimate-ranking-panda-express-items/)'s ranking of Panda Express' best menu items. Ever since chef Andy Kao invented it in 1987, it's been a best-seller for the chain, which sold 115 pounds of the dish — about one-third of all sales — in the year 2021 alone (per [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/panda-express-orange-chicken-changed-game-american-chinese-food-35-yea-rcna38016)). Despite its popularity, however, Luk says it's not one of their healthiest offerings. \"While the chicken is a lean protein that is lower in saturated fat (when the skin is removed), it appears to be battered, then fried to create a crispy texture,\" she noted, \"which ironically reintroduces saturated and potentially trans fat into the dish.\" And it's not just the fat that makes this dish problematic. \"The generous amount of sweet and spicy orange sauce provides a significant amount of added sugar, which the World Health Organization recommends we (adults and kids) limit to less than 5% of our daily calories,\" said Luk. Cream Cheese Rangoons After ordering their main dish at Panda Express, many people like to toss in a few Cream Cheese Rangoons to round out the meal. However, Luk said Panda Express' Cream Cheese Rangoons are also less than healthy, and, again, it's about their fat and sugar content. \"The wonton wrappers provide carbohydrate,\" she said, \"but after being deep fried, it's loaded with added fats and packs a heavy caloric punch without much [nutrient density](https://www.healthdigest.com/1397805/most-unexpected-nutrient-dense-food-watercress/). The cream cheese filling is a source of more added fat, while providing little in terms of protein and anything else.\" Luk added that the sweet and sour sauce that it's dipped in is really just added sugar. \"Put together, this appetizer is loaded with refined carbs and added fats, deficient in vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber, and is a poor choice for people managing their weight,\" she said. White Steamed Rice Given Luk's previous concerns about foods that are high in fat and sugar, it probably makes sense that opting for steamed white rice would be a safe choice for a side dish. However, it's really about which sides have more nutrition to offer, she said. \"In a nutshell, all the other side dishes have vegetables, which offer more fiber, vitamins, and minerals,\" said Luk. Additionally, she pointed out that the white rice served at Panda Express appears to be jasmine rice, which is high on [the glycemic index](https://www.healthdigest.com/416386/what-is-the-glycemic-index/), a scale that ranks how foods affect our blood sugar. \"High GI foods should be chosen least often by people living with diabetes, prediabetes, and heart health issues,\" said Luk. For a more nutritious side dish, consider [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com/nutritioninformation)' Super Greens. A single 90-calorie serving has only 3 grams of total fat and 4 grams of sugar.",

    "text": "A year on from Cyclone Gabrielle , Horizons Regional Council is releasing an educational campaign to share more about river management works and infrastructure in the region.\nIt is almost nine years since the Whanganui River burst its banks in 2015 and 20 years since the devastating Whanganui and Manawatū floods of 2004.\nHorizons manages and maintains stopbanks along Kowhai Park and Balgownie Ave in Whanganui. If a flood occurs in this area, Horizons’ emergency response team installs temporary flood barriers to supplement and support the stopbanks.\nOperations manager John Foxall said the campaign would help teach people of all ages how vital flood protection was for the region.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “These large floods are etched into the collective memories of many residents throughout our region and the country as a whole,” Foxall said.\n“Many of us, myself included, witnessed the devastation of 2004 first-hand and were served a sobering reminder of the power of water last year with Cyclone Gabrielle.\n“We wanted to mark these significant dates with something positive and so have created a series of educational videos detailing different types of flood protection infrastructure we manage in the region.\n“You’ll learn about how many dams we have in the region, how the Makino and Moutoa floodgates work, why stopbanks are so vital and much more.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. The different assets worked together to form Horizons’ river management network, which protected countless homes, businesses, public assets, farms, roads and railway networks from flooding throughout the region, he said.\n“We even have a competition running where you’ll need to answer questions about each type of flood protection.\n“Be first to answer all of the questions correctly and win a behind-the-scenes tour of the Moutoa Floodgates for four people. The visit will include a walk down to the gates if they’re dry, and the chance to even operate the gates yourself, with instruction from our staff.”\nFoxall said river management was something everyone could relate to or learn about in some way.\n“As part of the campaign, we’ll also be sharing images from our archives of the history of our flood protection infrastructure. Some of our assets, such as the Moutoa floodgates, have been around for more than 50 years and have got a rich history we think should be shared.\n“Rivers are at the heart of our region, flowing through every district and bringing us all together in some capacity. We all contribute to the health and well-being of our rivers and, in turn, they sustain us, so we think it’s important for everyone to be aware of the work we do to strengthen and maintain these vital assets.”\nThe campaign will run on Horizons’ Facebook and Instagram pages for two weeks starting Monday, February 19.\nMore information, including how to enter the competition, will be on Facebook or Instagram @HorizonsRegionalCouncil.

    "text": "Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, has been called a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming her forecasters failed to warn her about a historic storm.\nThe esteemed federal agency lambasted Mills after it was criticized for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on Dec. 18, causing massive flooding and leaving 400,000 people without power.\nMills put his foot down on this last Wednesday while touring flood-stricken Kennebec County, saying, “The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.”\nBut an NWS spokesman said the 75-year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting that state and local officials had been informed about the impending Dec. 15 flood.\nAnd on Sunday the 17th, the day before the storm, the weather service met with state officials to brief them on expected flooding, winds and impacts on the state’s coast.\nGov. Janet Mills is coming under fire for saying the National Weather Service did not adequately predict the severity of the winter storm that hit Maine last week.\nCars flood in a parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center along the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Waterville, Maine.\nMills and her office have yet to respond to the NWS’s claims that she is a liar.\nImages of the storm’s aftermath show cars dangling from extremely damaged roads, intense, murky flooding that swept away other vehicles, collapsed construction sites, and downed trees and power lines.\nThe storm, which Mills called “an extraordinary event,” moved northeast on Monday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people, forcing flight cancellations and killing at least four people.\nWind gusts reach nearly 70 miles per hour, which Mills also said the National Weather Service did not predict.\n“The National Weather Service did not predict winds between 68 and 70 miles per hour in any area of Maine,” he said. “It was an extraordinary event.”\nIn fact, the NWS appears to have predicted possible winds of 65 to 70 miles per hour while also predicting four to six inches of rain.\nEarlier this week, Mills announced the launch of an online resource for Maine residents who were severely impacted by flooding and other storm damage.\nThe Maine Flood Assistance and Resource Center opened Tuesday. According to the governor’s office, it will add “information, resources and assistance” for those affected by the storm.\nPropane tanks released by floodwaters discharge gas as they float on the Kennebec River through Augusta, Maine, on Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023.\nNathan Sennett and Tori Grasse recover furniture from a flooded patio near the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Hallowell, Maine.\nA car floats in a flooded parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center along the Kennebec River in Waterville, Maine\nA man watches the Kennebec River flood on December 19 in Maine\nThe center’s announcement came after states of civil emergency were declared in 14 of Maine’s 16 counties.\nThe severity of the storm’s damage led Mills to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Joe Biden, which will allow federal resources to supplement state-led recovery efforts.\n“In the wake of last week’s storm, my administration launched the Maine Flood Resource and Assistance Center to help Maine people with questions they may have about property damage, traffic safety, tree removal and more. “Mills said in the news release about the resource center.\n“We will update this website as more information becomes available as part of our effort to do everything we can to support the quickest recovery possible for Maine communities.”\nThe governor also announced Tuesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved the Maine Emergency Management Agency’s request to begin a preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step in requesting the aforementioned Major Disaster Declaration. .",

    "text": "The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against tech giant Microsoft and AI developer OpenAI in a legal maneuver that could reshape the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. T\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, contends that Microsoft, a key investor, and provider of cloud computing technology to OpenAI and OpenAI itself, owes “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” for the “unlawful copying and use” of The Times’s content. The newspaper asserts that the AI models developed by the defendants, notably GPT-4, directly compete with its content and limit commercial opportunities.\nThe New York Times acknowledges the potential benefits of AI, stating, “recognizes the power and potential of GenAI for the public and journalism.” However, it emphasizes the neneedor journalistic material to be used only for commercial gain permission from the source. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI failed to seek such consent.\nOpenAI, responding to the legal action, expresses surprise and disappointment, noting ongoing productive conversations with The New York Times. The AI developer emphasizes its commitment to respecting the rights of content creators and suggests a hope for a mutually beneficial resolution.\nThe legal proceedings involve Susman Godfrey, the litigation firm known for representing Dominion Voting Systems in a high-profile defamation suit against Fox News. The lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI echoes a separate case where author Julian Sancton and other writers accused companies of using copyrighted materials without permission to train AI models, including ChatGPT.\nConcerns among media publishers about AI models utilizing their content without proper authorization have grown, with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT producing outputs that sometimes closely resemble the source material. Publishers fear potential impacts on traffic and revenues as AI-generated content competes with original journalism.\nThe lawsuit highlights instances where GPT-4 allegedly produced altered versions of New York Times articles. The Times argues that AIroducing and modifying its content limits the AI model’s commercial opportunities and infringes on copyrightable expression. Examples cited include removing product links from The Times’s Wirecutter app, impacting potential referral revenue.\nAs the legal battle unfolds, it brings to the forefront the intricate challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in journalism, questioning the boundaries of fair use and the need for collaborative frameworks between technology developers and content creators.",

This year, he set a record of 3 wins in a season for the first time in 5 years since Park Sang-hyun (40, Dong-A Pharmaceutical) in 2018, and for the first time in 16 years for a player in his 20s. He postponed his military service due to his refusal to join the military, and as the saying goes, ‘rowing while the water is rising,’ he is spending a winter that is hotter than ever.\nGo Gun-taek is participating in the LIV Golf Promotion held at the Abu Dhabi GC in the United Arab Emirates, which opens on the 8th and runs until the 10th. If you place in the top three in this competition, which is a qualifying school, you will receive a ticket to next year's LIV Golf. Go Gun-taek said, “Because only the top three players are selected, I actually applied to compete to gain experience,” and added, “I plan to learn a lot by meeting foreign players.”\nGo Gun-taek opened the door to the first and\n부산달리기 second half of this season’s KPGA Tour. He debuted on the regular tour in 2020 and won his first career win at the season opener, DB Non-life Insurance Promi Open in April this year. Then, he added a number of wins at the Honors K and Solarago CC Han Jang Sang Invitational in July, and even won the 39th Shinhan Donghae Open in September, the first tournament of the second half of the year, accumulating 3 wins in 5 months. “I won three games this year, but the fact that I didn’t receive the grand prize means I wasn’t consistent,” said Go Gun-taek, who was disappointed. “I’m still nothing.” “We need to learn more in the future,” he emphasized. This year's Genesis Grand Prize (MVP) was won by Ham Jeong-woo (29, Hana Financial Group), and Go Gun-taek was the winner of the most wins.\nGo Gun-taek, who had not won in 48 competitions until last year, benefited greatly from improving his distance and ability to use various pitches. The result led to three championship trophies. This year, he recorded an average driver shot distance of 293 yards (48th) on the KPGA Tour. This is an increase of about\nread more 15 yards compared to last year, and this year is the first time that he has ranked in the top 50 in the long distance category since his debut. He also easily threw the desired pitches, such as draws and fades. He said, “During last winter, I practiced a lot of pitches while improving my backswing and grip. “I used to hit the draw, but I made a lot of misses,” he said. “This year, it became easier to target the hole by hitting both the draw and the fade. “The increased distance of over 10m was also a big help,” he explained.\nGo Gun-taek was originally planning to enlist in the military in December after finishing this season. He couldn't help but be worried about the 'military gap (vacancy due to military service)', which KPGA tour players regard as the biggest risk. However, the road to overseas expansion was opened by winning the Shinhan Donghae Open jointly organized by Korea, Japan, and the Asian Tour. Received a 5-year seed for the KPGA Tour and a 2-year seed for the Japan and Asian Tours. He immediately canceled his application to enlist in the Army Technical Administration Corps, which he had applied for a few days before the opening of this competition. “Now that I am eligible to participate, I want to gain experience in overseas tours. “It will definitely help my golf career,” he said.\nNext year is expected to be more challenging than this year for Go Gun-taek, who postponed his military service. Ko Gun-taek, who set his goal of winning 4 wins in the KPGA Tour season and winning overseas tours next year, said, “It was difficult to win 3 times, but the higher the goal, the better, so I will aim for 4 wins in the season.” He added, “I will aim for 4 wins in the season until the KPGA Tour season begins next spring.” “I plan to play in Korea and then tour Japan and Korea in parallel,” he said.\nKPGA Ko Gun-taek “I postponed my enlistment, so I will challenge myself to win 4 games this season and win the overseas tour.”\n“It was a very meaningful season where I learned a lot from moments when the play didn’t go well.”",

    "title": "Modi's government targeted Indian journalists with Israeli spyware, says Amnesty - EFE Noticias",
    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 28 (EFE).- Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has allegedly targeted high-profile Indian journalists with Pegasus, the Israeli spyware that makes a phone’s encrypted messages, camera, and microphone vulnerable to third-party access.\nThe fresh cases of Pegasus infections found in the iPhones of at least two Indian editors were revealed during a forensic investigation by Amnesty International’s Security Lab. The global rights group carried out the forensic probe in partnership with The Washington Post.\nThe Post said that an additional examination, with the help of New York security firm iVerify, found that opposition Indian politicians had also been targeted.\nThe surveillance software is created by Israeli firm NSO Group and sold only to governments around the world. It is used to access a phone’s messages and emails, peruse photos, eavesdrop on calls, track locations, and even film the owner with the camera.\nThe new cases add to the evidence that the Indian government was using powerful surveillance tools against its critics, civil society organizations, journalists, and activists.\nThe two targeted journalists are Siddharth Varadarajan, Founding Editor of The Wire portal, and Anand Mangnale, the South Asia Editor at The Organised Crime and Corruption Report Project (OCCRP), with the latest identified case occurring in October 2023.\n“The use of Pegasus…comes amid an unprecedented crackdown by the Indian authorities on freedom of peaceful expression and assembly, which has had a chilling impact on civil society organizations, journalists, and activists,” Amnesty’s Security Lab head Donncha Ó Cearbhaill said.\nÓ Cearbhaill said the findings showed that Indian journalists face “unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs.”\n“Despite repeated revelations, there has been a shameful lack of accountability about the use of Pegasus spyware in India which only intensifies the sense of impunity over these human rights violations.”\nThe rights group said it first observed indications of renewed Pegasus spyware threats towards individuals in India during a regular technical monitoring exercise in June 2023, months after media reported that the government was seeking to procure a new commercial spyware system.\nIn October 2023, Apple issued a new round of threat notifications globally to iPhone users who may have been targeted by “state-sponsored attackers.” More than 20 journalists, and opposition politicians in India were reported to have received the notifications.\nAs a result, Amnesty’s lab undertook a forensic analysis on the phones of individuals around the world who received these notifications, including Varadarajan and Mangnale.\nIt found traces of Pegasus spyware activity on devices owned by both Indian journalists.\nThe lab recovered evidence from Mangnale’s device of a zero-click exploit that was sent to his phone over iMessage in August, designed to covertly install the Pegasus spyware.\n“The attempted targeting of Mangnale’s phone happened at a time when he was working on a story about an alleged stock manipulation by a large multinational conglomerate in India,” the rights group said, referring to Modi’s longtime ally, Gautam Adani, an Indian energy and infrastructure tycoon.\nThe OCCRP published a joint investigative story with the Financial Times and the Guardian on how Adani’s longtime associates had routed funds through offshore shell companies into publicly traded Adani shares.\nAdani denied the allegations, but opposition leaders reiterated accusations that Modi’s government was protecting Adani out of loyalty to the billionaire.\nThe NSO has declined to comment on specific customers, stressing that all of its software purchasers “are vetted law enforcement and intelligence agencies that license our technologies for the sole purpose of fighting terror and major crime.”\n“The company has no visibility to the targets, nor to the collected intelligence,” it told The Post.\nThe NSO said its policies and contracts provided mechanisms to avoid targeting of journalists, lawyers, and human rights defenders or political dissidents who are not involved in terror or serious crimes.
