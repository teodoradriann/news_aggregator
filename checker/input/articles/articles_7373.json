    "text": "[Earlier today, we told you about President Biden's intention to sign an executive order](https://twitchy.com/amy-curtis/2024/02/01/biden-eo-west-bank-israelis-n2392442) concerning Israelis in the West Bank, one that would sanction those who 'attacked' Palestinians. He did it, and took to Twitter/X to brag: I signed an Executive Order allowing the U.S. to issue sanctions against those who direct or participate in acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank, including extremist settlers.— President Biden (@POTUS) Today’s action seeks to promote security for Israelis and Palestinians alike. [February 1, 2024] It did not go over well for him, like, at all. West Bank cheered while innocent men, women, children, and even infants were kidnapped, tortured, raped, and murdered by Hamas.— The🐰FOO (@PolitiBunny) Jackass. [February 1, 2024] They did. We all saw the video. We would be better off with Elmo as President, you ridiculous laughingstock and utter failure.— Ultra Grateful Calvin 🇺🇸🐶🏒 🎶 (@shoveitjack) Run along now. It's past your bedtime. [February 1, 2024] Elmo at least seems to care about Americans. [February 1, 2024] So stunning. Much brave. Why doesn’t Joe Biden issue an Executive Order to close and secure the US border?— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) How many more times do our civilians and police officers have to fall victim to illegals before he takes action? Enough is enough. Biden needs to shut down the border or shut down the government. [February 1, 2024] His policy seems to be America last. You're really good at ignoring the border issues— Mark Zuckerberg - Parody (@MarkZuckss) [February 1, 2024] Yes he is. Today's Executive Order is proof that the real battleground is not in the Middle East...— Joel M. Petlin (@Joelmpetlin) It's in the Midwest, in swing states like Michigan.

Everyone sees through your b.s. in allowing Israel to commit heinous genocide against innocent Palestinians— Atif (@atif_chavez) [https://t.co/pRT2jYAsko] [February 1, 2024] Crumbs, indeed. Dont just sanction those four. Sanction the entire nation of Israel for its apartheid, genocide, dispossession, oppression, mutilation, humilation, & slaughter of innocent Palestinians.

    "text": "Christians attacked in Pakistan's Sargodha for ‘blasphemy’ Around 25 protesters have been arrested, police said. At least 10 members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement on a blasphemy accusation in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said. The crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, also hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district. [Download Now!](https://htandroidapp.page.link/xQtG) At least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader. \"They burned one house\" and several Christians were badly beaten, Bhatti said. A large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, Kamal said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back. One member of the Christian community who was taken to hospital was later said to be in a stable condition. Some 25 of the protesters have been arrested, said police official Assad Malhi, adding that 11 police officers suffered injuries during the operation to rescue the Christian community members from the crowd. The situation had calmed down by late evening, with leaders from both sides calling for peace, police said. A Christian rights group - Minority Rights March - said a 70-year-old man accused of the blasphemy was beaten and dragged by the mob. It said video footage showed that the police did not intervene. The police have denied the claim. Videos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street. Bhatti said the videos were images from the scene. Reuters could not independently verify the pictures. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\". Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores. While blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs. A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.

    "title": "Pine Island Facebook group: a lifeline to residents during hurricanes, power outages",
    "text": "As Hurricane Milton neared the western edge of Florida, where it would make landfall was uncertain. It wiggled and wobbled north, northeast, and east, slowly moving northwards of Southwest Florida, but leaving area residents on the dirty side of the storm. For those on the barrier islands, those thin slices of sand that used to be home largely to mangroves that would protect mainland Florida from the worst of the winds and waves, now popular tourist destinations and home to thousands, this was bad news. But on Pine Island, one popular Facebook group serves as a lifeline to many. Kevin and Jen Russell, the unofficial mayors of Pine Island, are also the administrators of the Facebook group Things to Do on Pine Island, a vital line of communication with residents during storms. Ian gave them a crash-course in how to vet info, keep in touch with sources, and disseminate information during a major hurricane. Now? They're pros. Jen, a former radio news director, runs the operation similar to a newsroom or an emergency operations center alongside Kevin. \"I think Ian really got us trained up for this kind of stuff: information in, information out, how to verify,\" Jen said. \"With the network of people we have providing information, we really know what we're doing now.\" They've sourced information from friends, neighbors, and residents they initially connected with through their Facebook group, in addition to more official sources, such as the Pine Island / Matlacha Fire District. As the years have gone by, and the hurricanes gotten more devastating, Things to do on Pine Island has become a go-to site for getting and sharing information. 'Fireflies' dance on electrical wires during Milton By early Thursday, it was clear Pine Island and Matlacha did not emerge from Milton unscathed. Forecasters had predicted Lee County would see 8-12 feet of storm surge as Hurricane Milton headed eastward, and nowhere is storm surge more precarious than on Florida’s barrier islands. On Pine Island and Matlacha, Florida's largest barrier island, the surge hit worst in the early hours of Thursday morning, when the tide was at its peak. The waters flooded over roads, lifted boats from their moorings and even knocked down a three-story building: a restaurant initially damaged during Ian. Residents also reported seeing what Kevin referred to as “fireflies” on the power lines and transformers, and flashes arcing off the same. The Russells shared a video one of their sources sent them of what looked like a transformer, red- and white-hot sparks dancing all over it. Those pops of light and color were not necessarily transformers, she said. \"It could be a transformer or a fuse, a protective device,\" said LCEC Public Relations Manager Karen Ryan. \"There could be sediment or salt contamination on the power lines. That will cause it to arc and what happens is whatever is on the lines, it will burn off. When it arcs like that, it looks like sparklers, a bright light, popping noises.\" Also, she said, tree branches touching the lines can cause an arc. Milton damages include fires, collapsed buildings At least one fire took place overnight, said Jen, who had spoken with the Matlacha / Pine Island Fire District, though it is not clear what sparked it. Ryan could not say for certain it wasn't an LCEC powerline, but, she said, she was doubtful. \"When a line is de-energized, it’s probably not going to create a fire because there’s no electricity in it,\" Ryan said. Most of Pine Island lost power during the storm, according to electrical company LCEC. Their power outage map showed that 99% of the island was sans power before midnight Wednesday. \"That's when the dirty side of the storm was hitting us,\" Ryan said. The district posted photos of a large fire, with flames reaching 20 feet high or more, to its Facebook page. According to Russell, the fire department said it took place around 2 a.m. Thursday. There were no reported injuries, she said. There were downed power lines on Stringfellow Road, as well. The fire district could not be reached for comment. “Crews made access to the island a few hours ago and are responding to several calls including structure fires,” the district wrote on its Facebook post. “Please stay off the road.” Too, the old Hooked Island Grill building collapsed further during Milton, blocking Pine Island Road overnight. While the road is now clear, the fire department has asked that only islanders return, in order to keep the roads clear for emergency responders as needed, Russell said. The Hooked Island Grill on Matlacha was initially severely damaged in Hurricane Ian. The local chain, with outlets in Fort Myers and Cape Coral, had planned to repair the building and return. A Facebook group turned lifeline Through it all, reports came in to the Russells, who, in turn, verified the info and posted what was necessary to their Facebook group. They even set up a walkie-talkie app they used during Ian, too, to communicate with residents when cell service went down. “People have no idea what is happening,” said Jen. So they turn to each other for answers. So often, sharing information on the Things to do on Pine Island Facebook group during massive storms like Milton leads to an answer to questions, a solution to their problems.
