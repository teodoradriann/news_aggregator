    "text": "Republican politicians have worked assiduously to win votes by posing as defenders of religious liberty. They aren’t always faking. However, the GOP’s military interventions in the Middle East have been singularly destructive, doing much to drive Christians and other religious minorities from the region.\nUltimately, President George W. Bush, along with his Republican followers and Christian fans, did more harm to religious minorities in the Middle East than did the Islamic State. Indeed, the latter would not exist but for Bush & Co.’s malign activities.\nA new report from the American Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation highlights the harm Washington has wreaked upon Middle East Christians. Religious minorities long have faced pressure in the region. AFRR’s board chairman, Max Wood, noted that \"Christianity is under attack across the globe but especially in the Middle East. Less than 100 years ago, Christians made up approximately 20% of the population in the Middle East. Today, that number is barely 4%.\"\nIf simply the result of voluntary action, there is little if anything the US government should do. Although Washington has good reason to support religious as well as political liberty, it has no reason to try to preserve religious diversity in any region. Indeed, as life grew more difficult for Mideast Christians, many decided to take advantage of opportunities to secure a better life in the West. The more Lebanese, Egyptian, and Palestinian Christians who emigrate to the US, the greater the opportunity for even more Lebanese, Egyptian, and Palestinian Christians to emigrate in the future.\nHowever, in recent years Christians, as well as members of other minority faiths, such as Bahais and Yezidis, have suffered through a tsunami of persecution and violence. Nowhere has the horror been worse than Iraq.\nMore than a million Christians – estimates varied – called Iraq home a couple decades ago. They were able to live their faith and worship freely. Saddam Hussein was a terrible dictator, but he was a secular tyrant. He brutalized anyone who opposed him but cared not at all about which god they worshipped. Hussein’s close associate, Tariz Aziz, was a high-ranking Baath Party member who served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister. Aziz also was a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church. His faith may have been merely nominal, but in no Arab state other than Syria, another secular dictatorship, did non-Muslims serve in such positions of political authority.\nThen came the blundering, lying, killing Bush administration.\nToday, Iraq’s Christian population is down about 80 percent. Noted AFRR: \"there are around only 150,000 Christians left in Iraq. Many Christians are seriously affected by intolerance and persecution. This is perpetuated mostly by militant Islamic groups and non-Christian leaders. They also face discrimination from government authorities. According to The World Watch List, (an annual ranking of the 50 countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution), Iraq is ranked 14th in the world. Being a Christian costs livelihoods, safety, purity and, very often, lives. Iraq remains plagued by conflict and sectarian violence. As recently as May 2021, Christian villages were evacuated in the Province of Dohuk in northern Iraq. Turkish airstrikes targeted a number of villages and bombs destroyed homes, businesses and churches.\"\nThis is an extraordinary achievement by the Bush administration. Of an incredibly negative sort.\nThe US invasion of Iraq – conducted under false pretenses and with unrealistic expectations – ousted the government, destroyed political institutions, unleashed Islamist extremists, and triggered sectarian conflict. Everyone, Christian, Sunni, Shiite, and other, was at risk. However, minorities, of few numbers and with few defenses, suffered the most. Many were kidnapped and murdered, while even more were driven from their homes. Kurdistan offered sanctuary for some religious minorities as well as Kurds. Many others fled to Syria, where they soon again found themselves in a violent cauldron.\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq reincarnated as the Islamic State, to which many Sunnis, victimized by the Shia-friendly government left in charge by America, turned to for protection. ISIS launched another brutal round against Christians and other religious minorities. Yezidi women suffered from a wave of sexual violence and slavery. Eventually the Iraqi government, assisted by both the US and Iran, beat back the Islamic State and eradicated the formal caliphate, though some ISIS adherents remain.\nHowever, even the State Department acknowledges that Iraq remains a dangerous place, though thankfully much less so than during active hostilities. State’s latest report on religious liberty reported: \"Minority religious groups, including Christians and Yezidis, said the presence of armed affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and PMF militias in Sinjar and the Ninewa Plain, as well as continued Turkish airstrikes targeting alleged PKK positions, continued to endanger residents and hinder the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Yezidi community in Sinjar reported in January and May that the PKK had kidnapped hundreds of Yezidi children to recruit and subject to ideological ‘brainwashing’ in the years since ISIS was defeated in Sinjar in 2015.\"\nMoreover, added State: \"According to media and human rights organizations, societal violence perpetrated by sectarian armed groups, mainly pro-Iran Shia militias, continued during the year, although there were no documented cases of violence specifically related to religious affiliation in the IKR. Christians in the south and in PMF-controlled towns on the Ninewa Plain, as well as Sabean-Mandeans in Basrah, Dhi Qar, and Maysan Provinces, reported they continued to avoid celebrating their religious festivals when these observances coincided with Shia Islamic periods of mourning, such as Ashura. There were continued reports that members of non-Muslim minority groups felt the Muslim majority pressured them to adhere to certain Islamic practices, such as wearing the hijab or fasting during Ramadan.\"\nProblems are not restricted to Iraq, unfortunately. In Syria President Barack Obama, who opposed the Iraq war, joined Islamist insurgents, including the local al-Qaeda affiliate, in attempting to overthrow the secular Assad regime. Naturally, Republicans, led by pro-war fanboys John McCain and Lindsey Graham, demanded even greater US involvement. Having seen the terrible end of the movie in Iraq, Syrian Christians and Alawites who I met on a trip a few years ago were horrified with Washington’s policy and accused US policymakers of having no idea what they were doing. Although the US did not intend to create violent chaos throughout the region, American money, arms, and advocacy fueled the conflict.\nToday Syria remains a frightening place for most everyone, including religious minorities. AFRR said of that nation: \"the situation is just as bleak, with over 10 million Christians fleeing intense sectarian violence over the last 20 years. Many have been displaced in their home countries, or have become refugees in neighboring countries, such as Jordan.\"\nThe Damascus regime continues to violate human rights and disproportionately rely upon Alawites, though whether the latter reflects religious discrimination or regime loyalty is a matter of some dispute. Worse, violent extremists, some previously backed by Washington, continue to wreak human havoc, and target the religiously vulnerable. The State Department related:\n\"The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (COI) again reported it had reasonable grounds to believe some Turkish-supported Syrian armed opposition groups (TSOs) committed abuses, including torture, rape, looting, and appropriating private property, particularly in Kurdish areas, as well as vandalizing Yezidi religious sites in areas under their control. The COI, human rights groups, and media organizations reported killings, arbitrary detentions, rape, and torture of civilians, and the looting and seizure of private properties in and around Afrin. … The COI found that despite its territorial defeat, violent attacks by ISIS remnants had increased, while human rights organizations stated that ISIS often targeted civilians, persons suspected of collaborating with security forces, and groups ISIS deemed to be apostates.\"\nMoreover, State added that \"Christians reportedly continued to face discrimination and violence at the hands of violent extremist groups. NGOs reported social conventions and religious proscriptions continued to make conversions – especially Muslim-to-Christian conversions, which remained banned by law – relatively rare. These groups also reported that societal pressure continued to force converts to relocate within the country or to emigrate in order to practice their new religion openly.\"\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of Washington’s misadventures in both Iraq and Syria is the failure most anyone in the War Party to undertake any rethink, show any repentance, or exhibit any sorrow over the death and destruction that resulted from their policies. They did not intend to unleash hell upon civilians, of course, but hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, Syrians, and others died in the \"global war on terrorism.\" Yet most US policymakers appear to channel Madeleine Albright and believe that the price, mostly paid by other people, nevertheless was worth it. After all, insisted Albright, we stand taller and see further.\nPaying an especially high price were Christians and other religious minorities. Yet many conservative Christian leaders seemed more interested in pandering to politicians than supporting foreign believers and pushed the Bush administration’s war campaign. Some evangelicals even imagined conquering new fields for planting the Gospel. After the invasion resulted in carnage, especially among Christian ranks, few religious leaders were inclined to rethink their militaristic stands, which seemed so contrary to the presentation of Jesus as the \"Prince of Peace.\" Even then, before Donald Trump, many evangelicals were loyal, even reflexive Republican foot soldiers.\nHorrendous violence has ravaged minority religious communities throughout the Middle East. Most responsible are the vicious, hate-filled extremists ready to kill those who believe differently. Thankfully, the worst of the violence has ebbed.\nNevertheless, Washington policymakers have done more than their share to destroy indigenous religious minorities throughout the Middle East. Many on the right have done so while posing as friends of the persecuted, penning articles and issuing statements of support for the victims of their own policies. The GOP paladins also befriended some of the worst, most vicious, religious despotisms, such as Saudi Arabia. Credulous evangelicals have even made a couple pilgrimages to the Kingdom, where Crown Prince Mohammed \"Slice ‘n Dice\" bin Salman, who not only murders but dismembers his critics, expressed his warm greetings.\nIf Christian conservatives really want to help fellow believers, they should take a new view of the Prince of Peace and oppose promiscuous intervention and war. That won’t end evil in the world. But it would stop making Americans complicit in so much destruction of human life and so many violations of human rights. Those who, in the words of John Quincy Adams, go \"abroad in search of monsters to destroy\" very often create new monsters that cause even greater harm.\nDoug Bandow is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan.

The Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced on the 1st that it had sunk the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet missile boat ``Ivanovets'' in western Crimea. The footage released shows a boat, believed to be a Ukrainian unmanned boat, meandering toward the ship, and an explosion on the water that leaves a large hole in the side of the ship. The previous day, a Ukrainian missile flew over Crimea and the Black Sea, and the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it had been intercepted.With the war situation in the east reaching a stalemate, the Ukrainian side appears to be intensifying its attacks on the area around Crimea.

Meanwhile, the Russian Federal Investigative Committee announced on the 1st that DNA tests have confirmed the remains of 65 Ukrainian soldiers and others who were said to have been on board the Russian military transport plane that crashed on the 24th of last month in western Russia. Furthermore, the transport plane also released an image of a part with the word \"Patriot\" on it, which the Ukrainian military said was shot down by the Patriot surface-to-air missile system provided by the United States, and was recovered at the scene. Russia appears to be trying to use the crash of the transport plane as an excuse to destabilize countries supporting Ukraine, and the Russian Duma passed a resolution on the 1st calling on the U.S. Congress to end aid to Ukraine. doing.",

    "text": "Curijanos salvaron la vida a hombre que fue asaltado y herido con un corte en el corazón. (Foto: Agencia Andina) En un acto heroico de profesionalismo y destreza quirúrgica, médicos del Hospital Regional de Cusco lograron salvar la vida de un hombre de 33 años que había sufrido un corte profundo en el corazón tras ser víctima de un asalto en las calles de la ciudad. El paciente, quien ingresó al hospital en un estado crítico, fue operado con éxito gracias a la intervención de un equipo especializado que ejecutó una cirugía compleja a corazón latiente.\nEl incidente ocurrió el pasado fin de semana, cuando el varón fue atacado por delincuentes en un robo violento . Durante el asalto, sufrió una herida cortante presternal, una lesión grave en el pecho, que afectó directamente al ventrículo izquierdo de su corazón , una de las cavidades vitales encargadas de enviar sangre rica en oxígeno al cuerpo. La rapidez de la intervención médica fue clave para evitar una tragedia aún mayor.\nCarlos Enrique Gamarra Valdivia , director del hospital, en conversación con Agencia Andina , expresó su admiración por la rapidez con que el equipo médico actuó para estabilizar al paciente, quien llegó al centro de salud descompensado y casi en estado de agonía. “El paciente fue evacuado por la Policía Nacional del Perú , y su situación era extremadamente crítica. Llegó al hospital en shock cardiogénico, un cuadro grave que requería atención inmediata. En ese momento, comenzamos con la intervención quirúrgica”, explicó Gamarra.\nEquipo médico del Hospital Regional del Cusco realizó cirujía a corazón latiente. (Foto: Agencia Andina) Cirugía a corazón latiente Marybell Vásquez Miranda , especialista en cirugía torácica y cardiovascular , detalló el proceso que los médicos siguieron para salvar la vida del paciente. “La cirugía fue extremadamente complicada debido a la zona afectada. Al realizar la toracotomía, descubrimos un trauma cardiaco grave con una lesión punzo-cortante de aproximadamente tres centímetros en el ventrículo izquierdo del corazón. Tuvimos que proceder a reparar el daño a corazón latiente, lo que aumentaba considerablemente los riesgos durante la operación”, señaló la doctora Vásquez.\nEl procedimiento que implica operar un corazón que sigue latiendo mientras se realiza la intervención, es sumamente delicada. Cualquier error o complicación podría haber provocado un sangrado masivo o, en el peor de los casos, la muerte del paciente. A pesar de la complejidad, el equipo médico, compuesto por cirujanos , emergenciólogos e intensivistas , trabajó con precisión y coordinación para realizar la operación con éxito.\nTras finalizar la intervención quirúrgica, el paciente fue trasladado a la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (UCI) , donde se mantuvo bajo estricta vigilancia. En esta unidad, recibió atención médica especializada que permitió su estabilización y posterior mejora. La intervención inicial fue crucial para evitar un desenlace fatal y, a las pocas horas de haber sido operado, el paciente comenzó a mostrar signos de recuperación.\nCirujanos del hospital regional de Cusco realizaron cirujía a corazón latiente para salvar la vida de un paciente víctima de asalto. (Foto: Infobae Perú/Agencia Andina) Trabajo en equipo fue fundamental El equipo médico destacó la importancia del trabajo conjunto de diversos especialistas en situaciones como esta. “La colaboración entre los médicos cirujanos, emergenciólogos, intensivistas y el personal de enfermería del hospital fue esencial para salvar la vida de este paciente. Este tipo de casos requieren un esfuerzo coordinado de todos los equipos involucrados”, expresó Vásquez.\nCon el paso de los días, la evolución del paciente fue favorable. De acuerdo con la especialista, el paciente comenzó a recuperar su estabilidad y ya fue dado de alta de la UCI, mostrando avances significativos en su proceso de recuperación. “Si todo sigue como hasta ahora, en los próximos días podría ser dado de alta para continuar su recuperación en casa”, indicó la doctora para el citado medio.\nEste caso resalta la importancia de la pronta atención médica y de los recursos con los que cuenta el Hospital Regional de Cusco , especialmente en situaciones de alta complejidad. La operación fue realizada bajo el marco del Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS) , lo que permitió que el paciente recibiera atención médica de calidad sin costos adicionales.\nEquipo médico realizó cirujía a corazón latiente en Cusco. (Foto: Agencia Andina) Profesionalismo del equipo médico El director del hospital, Gamarra Valdivia, destacó la trascendencia del trabajo realizado, considerando los riesgos inherentes a una operación en el tórax y a corazón latiente. “Afrontar una cirugía en estas condiciones siempre involucra riesgos, especialmente en una zona tan sensible como el corazón. Afortunadamente, gracias al esfuerzo y profesionalismo del equipo , el paciente pudo superar esta difícil situación”, señaló.\nEste caso es un claro ejemplo de cómo, en situaciones extremas, la rapidez y la habilidad de los equipos médicos pueden marcar la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte. Afortunadamente, gracias al trabajo coordinado de los profesionales de salud del Hospital Regional de Cusco, el hombre que sufrió el asalto y la grave herida en su corazón pudo superar un momento crítico y sigue en recuperación.",

    "text": "Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG (HHLA) opened the first test field for hydrogen-powered port logistics as well as the corresponding hydrogen refuelling station in the Port of Hamburg today. The test field at the Container Terminal Tollerort (CTT) is another milestone on the path to decarbonising logistics. Together with its partner companies from the Clean Port & Logistics cluster, HHLA is testing the reliability of hydrogen to supply heavy goods vehicles during operations.\nAngela Titzrath, Chief Executive Officer of HHLA, opened the test field today together with Dr Melanie Leonhard, Senator for Economy and Innovation of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, Christian Maaß, Director of Heat, Hydrogen & Efficiency in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Antje Roß, Manager Port Networks and Applications, NOW GmbH and Dr Lucien Robroek, President of Technology Solutions Division of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, by successfully filling a hydrogen-powered tractor unit.\nAngela Titzrath, CEO of HHLA: “We’re pleased to open the first test field for hydrogen-powered port logistics today. It enables us to test future technologies, gather valuable data and evaluate the results. In this way, we are shaping the sustainable future of logistics and continuing to invest in innovative technologies. We are sharing our findings with companies facing similar challenges in order to develop climate-friendly transport solutions together. Our objective is clear: We want to decarbonise the logistics sector and achieve our target of climate-neutral operations throughout the Group by 2040.”\nDr Volker Wissing, Federal Minister for Digital and Transport: “With Clean Port & Logistics, a lighthouse project for the use of hydrogen in port logistics has been created at the Port of Hamburg. From forklift trucks to tractor units and trucks – the hydrogen infrastructure we are funding here is paving the way for climate-friendly logistics on site. I hope that the hydrogen test field will have a strong signalling effect thanks to the commitment of the port players. This is the only way we will succeed in making logistics in Germany climate-friendly.”\nDr Melanie Leonhard, Senator for Economy and Innovation: “The opening is an important step for the Port of Hamburg. In future, it will enable the use of hydrogen-powered heavy goods vehicles at the terminals and beyond. The potential for the Port of Hamburg and the logistics sector is significant – for example, trucks that regularly come to the Port of Hamburg can also benefit from such an infrastructure in the future. The test field helps us to gain important experience in this area. HHLA and its partners are thus continuing to drive forward the transformation and decarbonization of handling and transport processes.”\nFirst test field for hydrogen-powered port logistics as well as the corresponding hydrogen refuelling station in the Port of Hamburg opened.\nDr Lucien Robroek, President of Technology Solutions Division at Hyster-Yale Materials Handling: “Hyster is a pioneer in the development of electric heavy-duty trucks including container handling vehicles powered by Nuvera® fuel cells. We are excited to be working with HHLA to uncover new possibilities and learnings as we begin testing the Hyster® hydrogen fuel cell-powered terminal tractor in a live port application. We continue to collaborate with forward thinking operations that are keen to explore new solutions as part of their journey towards both sustainability and efficiency.”\nWith the opening of the test field and inauguration of the hydrogen refuelling station, the required infrastructure is now ready to speed up the transition to emissions-free heavy goods logistics and port operations, and to drive forward the decarbonisation of logistics. Equipment such as straddle carriers, empty container stackers, forklift trucks, reach stackers, tractor units and trucks can be efficiently filled to 350 bar with green hydrogen. The refuelling station will be open to the public and thus also offers other companies the opportunity to test climate-friendly transport solutions. The check-in at the terminal requires registration in the passify app.\nSince 2022 HHLA has been working together with more than 40 partner companies from around the world in the Clean Port & Logistics cluster. The common goal is to develop solutions to bring hydrogen-powered heavy goods vehicles and terminal equipment to market quickly as well as to put in place the measures necessary for their use. The concepts developed by the working groups for operation, safety, maintenance, refuelling and supply are tested and optimised in practical operation in the test field at CTT. The first trials have been conducted at the refuelling station with equipment from Hyster-Yale, VWG Oldenburg and CMB.TECH’s hydrogen truck over the past few weeks. Their collaboration in CPL helps the companies on the way to decarbonising their processes and making meaningful, climate-friendly investments as they compile the necessary information and practical experience.\nThe cluster as well as the refuelling station received funding of approximately three million euros from the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport as part of a national innovation programme for hydrogen and fuel cell technology. The funding guidelines are coordinated by NOW GmbH and implemented by Project Management Jülich (PTJ).\nAs part of the “Balanced Logistics” sustainability strategy, HHLA is aiming to become climate-neutral throughout the Group by 2040. To achieve this, HHLA has been relying on the electrification of its processes and equipment across Europe for many years. Hydrogen could make a significant contribution to the further decarbonisation of logistics. In addition to using hydrogen for its heavy goods equipment, HHLA is also active in the field of import and distribution. With its extensive European network of seaport terminals and intermodal connections, HHLA is very well equipped to take advantage of the opportunities in hydrogen import and transportation.\nSource: Port of Hamburg\n2024-07-05 ",

    "title": "Hope for climate resilience: Native rice varieties survive in Meghna chars | The Business Standard",
    "text": "Defying unpredictable weather patterns and climate change, a few indigenous rice varieties have clung to survival in the country's riverine chars when no other varieties are capable of withstanding the harsh weather conditions. For generations, farmers in the southern coastal region have relied on these native species, defying the odds and offering a glimmer of hope for climate-resilient agriculture. Among these resilient paddies are the Lotor, Kalagora and Garcha varieties, admired by farmers in the Meghna River chars for their unique qualities. Cultivated on riverside chars and mid-river islands, they have witnessed hundreds of years of changing landscapes and extreme weather events. Unlike commercially developed varieties, their origins remain a mystery, untouched by scientific research. Farmers believe that research on these varieties could lead to even better rice strains, able to withstand the changing climate. Their experiences offer valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices adapted to the region's specific challenges. The Business Standard recently spoke with farmers in coastal Lakshmipur to understand their time-tested practices and the potential these rice varieties hold for the future. Farmer Md Monir Hossain, a resident of Char Shamsuddin, has long known the value of these native varieties. \"My ancestors have been cultivating these rice varieties for generations,\" says Monir. \"Nothing else grows here due to the harsh conditions. These varieties are our only hope.\" Why native rice thrived for 100 years Native rice varieties like Lotar, Kalagora and Garcha have been popular among farmers for a century due to their remarkable resilience and low-maintenance nature. Their continued preservation ensures sustainable food production in challenging environments. \"These native rice varieties can survive against salt, drought, waterlogging, heavy winds and natural calamities,\" explains Md Mostafa, a resident of Kanibogar Char in Raipur Upazila. \"No chemical fertilisers or pesticides are needed. Besides, two or three varieties of native rice can be cultivated together.\" This multi-cropping advantage is another reason why farmers have cherished these ancient varieties for ages. For how many years have they been cultivated? Nurul Haque, an elderly farmer, noted that even during their ancestors' times, these rice varieties were grown. That means these rice varieties have sustained the Char people for over 100 years. Meghna Char farmers Md Saiful Islam, Md Al Amin, Md Moktar, Md Didar, and Harun shared similar insights. How and when is cultivation? Alauddin Master, from Char Abdullah in Ramgati Upazila, explained that Char lands require only one cultivation cycle. Around June each year, one kilogram of dry or soaked paddy is sown on every eight decimal of land. Seedlings typically emerge within 5-6 days. After roughly 180 days, the paddy matures and turns black around December, signalling harvest time for farmers. Cost and yield Cultivation and harvesting costs are the only expenses. Some farmers use urea fertiliser, but it is optional. Farmers get 25-30 maunds (40 kg=1 maund) of paddy per acre of land. Land area and production According to the Small Atlas of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics published in 2017, there are about 100,000 acres of land in the Meghna River bordering Bhola and Noakhali along with 20 chars of the Meghna River in four upazilas of Lakshmipur. Ahsan Ullah Hiran and Didar Hossain, farmer leaders of Char Kangkra in Lakshmipur, said in the last Aman season, farmers harvested at least 200 tonnes of paddy from 200 acres of chars. Vanishing native rice varieties Around 20 varieties of native rice have disappeared in Lakshmipur in the last 5-10 years. Around 13 Aman season varieties and 7 Aush season varieties are now lost. Local farmers are still cultivating the Lotar, Kalagora and Garcha varieties. These remaining varieties are climate-tolerant and warrant further research. Why indigenous rice varieties need saving While modern varieties offer higher yields, these traditional options often provide a more secure and sustainable livelihood in the long run, farmers say. Farmer Saiful Islam said \"Focusing solely on Ufshi and hybrid rice while depending on multinational companies can be detrimental. We must research and preserve indigenous rice varieties that have adapted to the climate for centuries.\" Dr Zakir Hossain, deputy director of Lakshmipur Department of Agriculture Extension, said, \"These rice varieties are crucial for our agriculture as they withstand drought, salt, storms and tidal water. However, research is needed to shorten their growth cycle and increase yield.\" Call to action Md Ismail Hossain Babu, director of the Greenland Project of Sabuj Bangladesh, said the government, agriculture department and private organisations should collaborate on research of indigenous rice varieties, establish gene banks to conserve these varieties, and promote the use of indigenous rice among farmers.",
