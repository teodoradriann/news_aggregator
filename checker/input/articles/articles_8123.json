    "text": "L’attaquant de l’OL Georges Mikautadze a adressé un message fort à ses coéquipiers en vue du match contre Toulouse en Ligue 1 ce week-end. Hier soir, l’Olympique Lyonnais a été éliminé dès les seizièmes de finale de la Coupe de France par Bourgoin-Jailleu, pensionnaire de National 3. Un coup de tonnerre pour le dernier finaliste de la compétition.\nAuteur du second but lyonnais, avant de sortir au profit d’Alexandre Lacazette en deuxième mi-temps, Georges Mikautadze était très mécontent de la performance de son équipe. Malgré tout, il a tenu à adresser un message positif à ses coéquipiers.\n« Pas d’excuse. Se relever, samedi, tous ensemble » , a écrit l’attaquant lyonnais sur son compte X après le match.\nDes mots qui rassureront probablement Pierre Sage, sous le choc de l’élimination prématurée de son équipe. L’entraîneur de l’OL espère une réaction d’orgueil de ses joueurs lors de la réception de Toulouse au Groupama Stadium samedi soir, pour le compte de la 18e journée de Ligue 1.\nPas d’excuse.\nSe relever, samedi, tous ensemble. pic.twitter.com/qrukZMDv6a\n— Georges Mikautadze (@MikautadzeG) January 15, 2025",
