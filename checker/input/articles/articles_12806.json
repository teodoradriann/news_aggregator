    "text": "Fairfield tudents and school families have combined with local businesses to raise a record $17,000 to help a local teacher battling cancer, Fairfield school officials recently announced. A key decision earlier this year to re-focus donated funds to local individuals battling cancer – rather than forward monies to national organizations – played a big role in bringing more effectiveness and energy to fundraising, said the group’s leader. Fairfield teacher Jessi Grimes, co-founder of the non-profit Fairfield Leads the Fight, said the recent tally of $17,000 in donations is a testament to the soundness of the new strategy. “This has been our most successful year by far, which we attribute to the ever-growing sense of community. It has been amazing to see so many people from Fairfield - and beyond - unite to do good for one of our own,” said Grimes, who teaches at Fairfield Academy and is the girls head varsity volleyball coach at Fairfield High School. The school-based, non-profit group recently hosted its annual fundraising event at Fairfield Freshman School and Grimes also coordinates an annual volleyball game for Fairfield Leads the Fight as part of its fundraising. The $17,000 will go to help a Fairfield teacher who is battling breast cancer. “Now that we have established as a nonprofit, we have been able to utilize other avenues of fundraising, like a round up event from Hamilton’s Pour House, golf club raffles, and our first annual pickleball tournament,” said Grimes. “We also sell shirts to all Fairfield Schools’ staffers, which has been our biggest moneymaker to date.” Gina Gentry-Fletcher, spokeswoman for Fairfield Schools – which enrolls students from both the city of Fairfield and adjacent Fairfield Twp. – praised Grimes and all the group’s volunteers for their efforts to help cover the medical expenses of teacher Elizabeth Meier. “This year, all proceeds go directly to support Meier, a beloved Central Elementary teacher currently battling breast cancer,” said Gentry-Fletcher. “This (Fairfield Freshman School) event raised $7,000, but with additional support from local businesses and events, including T-shirt sales, the total this year reached almost $17,000.” Grimes said the freshman school event grows larger each year. “It’s so fun to see the way students embrace the mission and emotionally connect to the cause. So many of them have been personally impacted by cancer and are glad to have an outlet that helps them feel like they are making a difference.” “We have also been supported by local businesses donating to the event, including Cassano’s and Forest Park Skyline,” she said. “We are still learning and growing as an organization and will have other fundraising opportunities forthcoming, but we are accepting donations via Venmo @ffleadsthefight . People can also follow us on social media on Instagram and Facebook.” [1New high school coming to Monroe after voters approve tax bond](/news/new-high-school-coming-to-monroe-after-voters-approve-tax-bond/5FDYQLDUIJH5LHGGTABAZK3BUY/) [210 area women to be honored for their inspiration, leadership](/news/10-area-women-to-be-honored-for-their-inspiration-leadership/URLREAPBIFGRNFTYRF4GWLHXPM/) [3Two popular tribute acts to perform at the Sorg this weekend](/news/two-popular-tribute-acts-to-perform-at-the-sorg-this-weekend/IRSQCJ4AYFGLJDW2OVOZZUAZKI/) [4 Middletown police promote 6, command staff filled for the first time in...](/news/middletown-police-promote-6-command-staff-filled-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-year/S745N6Y7HBAZVLSYL7SQKGG42E/) [5 Longtime insurance agent, community leader dies in freak airport...](/news/longtime-insurance-agent-community-leader-dies-in-freak-airport-accident/2BPVCTMAMVBE7MF2FRTFRFIOMY/) About the Author",

    "title": "I replaced my Shokz with these bone conduction headphones - and won't be going back",
    "text": "ZDNET's key takeaways are bone-conduction headphones that sell for $159 a pair on Amazon.They're much more comfortable to wear during runs, and controlling audio playback is much easier.However, you will have to get used to the unique form factor and come to terms with the fact that they won't completely block out surrounding noise.I've been using bone conduction headphones for about ten years now. I started using them after going through countless pairs of traditional headphones that simply could not take the sweat or the constant movement, ruining the wire connections. Also: Why I ditched my bone conduction headphones for these 'wired' earbuds - and don't regret itOn top of all that, earbuds rarely stay in my ears when I'm running. The last thing I need is to lose an expensive pair of earbuds when physics gets the best of the tiny technology and gravity takes the earbud for a crash landing on the pavement. I recently started testing a Mojawa pair that resembles my favorite Shokz Open Run Pros. Since then, it's safe to say the have become my new go-to bone conduction headphones. Here's why. The tech specsBattery: 150mAh Li-Polymer with a charge time of 50 minutes and 8 hours of playtime.Dual suspension anchor system for deeper/more resonant bass.Voice assistant: YesFrequency response: 20Hz-20KHzSensitivity: 110dB+/- 5dBBluetooth version: 5.2MP3 Storage: 32GBEQ: YesWaterproof: IP68Weight: 29.7gCost: $159Obviously, some of the features (such as EQ and MP3 Storage) require a third-party app. I generally don't install such apps (because I prefer security and privacy over added features), so I haven't bothered with the EQ or the MP3 storage. That's fine, as I don't need those options. Why? Bone-conducting headphones can only sound so good, and I always run on my phone. The first runI'm not going to lie. The first run wasn't exactly a spectacular outing. However, the initial impression of the hardware itself was impressive. One complaint I've had (for the longest time) about the Shokz headphones: The button to pause and skip songs is tiny. Even worse, getting the double-click right to skip a song can be challenging. Double-click too quickly, and it registers as a single click. I've always had problems with that Open Run Pro button.The Mojawa Run Plus solves that problem completely. With a much bigger button on the left side of the headphones, pausing (one click), skipping (two clicks), or replaying (three clicks) a song is effortless. Also: One of the best budget earbuds I've tested can make everything sound goodThe Mojawa takes the UX even further by adding a touch \"slider\" on the right side of the headphones. Swipe up to increase the volume, and swipe down to decrease it. Unlike the Shokz, which uses two small physical buttons on the underside of the right side of the device to change volume, the Mojawa makes increasing/decreasing the sound very easy.The first run outing was less than spectacular because I had trouble with the sound. The sound was far too soft, and no matter how many times I swiped up on the touchpad, it wouldn't increase. That's problematic for bone-conducting headphones because your ears are wide open, and the ambient sound can easily drown out the music.Also: The best bone conduction headphones you can buy: Expert testedFortunately, the ensuing runs didn't suffer from that issue. I'm not sure if it was a Spotify or Android issue, but they sounded considerably louder the next time I went to test the Mojawa Run Plus. In fact, I would easily place them on par with the (which are the best bone-conducting headphones I've tried).Should you buy AirPods instead?Now, you may be wondering: should you get the Run Plus or a pair of AirPods for the gym? The AirPods 4 are launching on September 20, so it's a good time to snag a pair. If you're going to be doing a lot of cardio, get the Mojawa headphones. Their design ensures the pair grip your ears with no chance of ever falling off. Plus, the open design of Run Plus allows you to hold conversations with your gym buddies, and you don't have to take them off.AirPods deliver great audio output, but aren't really meant for exercise. Apple's pair have an water resistance rating of IP54 allowing them to survive splashes of water or sweat. Mojawa's pair have a higher rating of IP68, meaning you can take them in the pool with you and they'll be fine.Also: I've used my AirPods Pro 2 since their 2022 release. Are they still worth it in 2024?These headphones have supplanted my Shokz Open Run Pros for the time being. We'll see if longevity is on the side of the Run Plus (as Shokz headphones tend to go the distance). If so, these headphones will come with my highest recommendation for active people looking for headphones that can tolerate sweat, water, and the typical beating that exercise inflicts on such technology.ZDNET's buying adviceNot everyone can get accustomed to bone-conducting headphones. I've had friends and family who tried them (on my recommendation), and a handful of people have come back to say they didn't like how they felt on their heads. Everyone else loved them.Who benefits from the ? These are for you if you regularly exercise and produce considerable sweat (and aren't concerned about the best sound possible). Also, if you find the to be challenging to control, the Mojawa will make you very happy.",

    "text": "Le torchon brûle à nouveau entre l’Algérie et le Maroc . Tels deux frères ennemis, ces géants du Maghreb perpétuent une querelle ancestrale, ravivant les braises d’un conflit qui ne cesse de couver. Leur antagonisme, enraciné dans l’histoire postcoloniale, s’est cristallisé autour de différends territoriaux, notamment la question épineuse du Sahara occidental . Ce contentieux, véritable nœud gordien des relations bilatérales, a été à l’origine de multiples crises diplomatiques, culminant avec la fermeture des frontières en 1994 . Depuis, les tensions n’ont cessé d’osciller entre accalmies précaires et regains de fièvre, au gré des soubresauts politiques et des enjeux géostratégiques régionaux.\nUne décision lourde de conséquences Le dernier coup d’éclat en date est survenu le jeudi 26 septembre 2024, lorsque le gouvernement algérien a annoncé la réinstauration immédiate de l’obligation de visa d’entrée sur son territoire pour les détenteurs de passeport marocain. Cette mesure, tombée comme un couperet, marque une nouvelle escalade dans les relations déjà tendues entre les deux pays. Elle intervient dans un contexte politique particulier, à peine deux semaines après la réélection controversée d’Abdelmadjid Tebboune à la tête de l’État algérien.\nLa diplomatie algérienne justifie cette décision par des considérations sécuritaires, accusant le Maroc de s’être livré à « diverses actions attentatoires à la stabilité de l’Algérie et à sa sécurité nationale » . Le communiqué officiel dresse un réquisitoire accablant, évoquant l’organisation à grande échelle de réseaux criminels, trafics en tous genres, et même des activités d’espionnage impliquant des agents de renseignements étrangers munis de passeports marocains.\nDes accusations qui masquent mal les tensions sous-jacentes Derrière ce discours sécuritaire se cachent des enjeux plus profonds. La décision algérienne semble être l’aboutissement d’une campagne médiatique orchestrée sur les réseaux sociaux, appelant depuis plusieurs semaines à la réinstauration du visa pour les Marocains. Cette mobilisation virtuelle traduit un sentiment de méfiance grandissant au sein de la population algérienne, habilement exploité par les autorités.\nEn pointant du doigt le Maroc comme « seul responsable de l’actuel processus de dégradation des relations bilatérales » , l’Algérie cherche à consolider sa position sur l’échiquier régional. Cette rhétorique belliqueuse permet au pouvoir en place de détourner l’attention des problèmes internes, tout en ravivant le sentiment nationaliste.\nUn pas en arrière pour la coopération régionale La réinstauration du visa marque un net recul dans les efforts de rapprochement entre les deux pays. Elle remet en question les timides avancées observées ces dernières années en matière de circulation des personnes. L’Algérie, qui se targuait jusqu’alors d’avoir maintenu une certaine « fluidité » dans les déplacements malgré la rupture des relations diplomatiques en 2021, semble aujourd’hui privilégier une approche plus restrictive.\nCette décision risque d’avoir des répercussions importantes sur les liens familiaux et les échanges culturels entre les deux peuples. Elle pourrait également affecter les dynamiques économiques transfrontalières, déjà mises à mal par des années de tensions. Au-delà des considérations bilatérales, c’est tout le projet d’intégration maghrébine qui se trouve une fois de plus fragilisé par ces querelles intestines.\nAinsi, le feuilleton des rivalités algéro-marocaines connaît un nouveau rebondissement, illustrant la difficulté persistante à dépasser les antagonismes historiques. Dans ce climat de méfiance réciproque, la perspective d’une normalisation des relations semble plus lointaine que jamais, laissant planer l’ombre d’une fragmentation durable du Maghreb.\nIsraël: 3 pays arabes publient un communiqué cinglant",

    "text": "Tom McGurk Cherry Hill Courier-Post Three South Jersey coaches will be a part of the Class of 2024 inducted into the New Jersey State Coaches Association Hall of Fame in January.\nFormer Washington Township boys soccer coach Shane Snyder, along with former Holy Cross/Burlington Township football coach Tom Maderia and current Burlington Township football coach Steve Everette, are the local honorees.\nThe three will join Eileen Allan (Pompton Lakes), Vicki Allison (Mountain Lakes/Morris Knolls), Robert Bechtloff (Central), Robert Buccino (Pascack Hills), Miguel Cabrita (St. Joseph Metuchen), Ken Cieslak (Teaneck/Palisades Park), Bill Clifton (Middletown South/Kearny), Chad Griffiths (Ridge), Roy Hamblen (West Morris Mendham), Drew Morano (Union City), Robert Nucci (Raritan), Jim Shlentz (Colts Neck/St. John Vianney), Bruce Shatel (Roxbury/Delbarton) and Dave Van Hook (Ramapo) in the Class of 2024.\nThe annual induction banquet will be held on Jan. 12 at the Pines Manor in Edison. Tickets for the NJSCA banquet can be purchased through the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association website . Deadline is Dec. 31.\nSnyder guided Washington Township for 14 years, compiling a 241-52-19 career record with three state Group 4 titles and seven sectional banners – championships never achieved by the Minutemen before Snyder took over the program. The Minutemen also won eight conference titles and three Coaches Tournament championships.\nPrior to taking over the boys’ program, Snyder led the Washington Township girls’ program, leading the Minutemaids to a 91-40-7 mark in six seasons.\nSynder remains a special education teacher at Washington Township.\nMaderia coached high school football for 32 years in South Jersey. He led Holy Cross for 11 seasons, guiding the Lancers to a 90-28 record with two state championships.\nMaderia spent 21 seasons at Burlington Township before stepping down in 2023. The Falcons compiled a 131-82 mark at BT, qualifying for the postseason 18 times including a berth in the South Jersey Group 3 final in 2018.\nThis fall, Maderia helped his son, TJ, who is the head coach at Holy Cross Prep Academy.\nEverette replaced Maderia at Burlington Township this season, leading the Falcons to an 8-2 record and a playoff appearance. He is a special education and social studies teacher at Burlington Township.\nPrior to that, Everette coached at his alma mater, Willingboro, where he led the Chimeras to three sectional titles and a regional crown before stepping down after the 2023 season. In 2019, Willingboro went 12-1 with sectional and regional titles after earning consecutive Central Jersey Group 2 titles the previous two seasons.\nAfter earning assistant coaching jobs at Cinnaminson and Oakcrest, Everette had two previous head coaching gigs at Clayton and Princeton. He also was the defensive coordinator for the lightweight football team at Princeton University for four years.\nTom McGurk is a regional sports editor for the Courier-Post, The Daily Journal and Burlington County Times, covering South Jersey sports for over 35 years.

    "title": "'Had he ever read the Constitution': Legal expert pours cold water on Trump's revenge plan",
    "text": "Former President Donald\nTrump, who once said \"lock her up\" to 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, is once again floating the idea of prosecuting political rivals, including President Joe Biden and lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee.\nThere's just one problem with the plan — lawmakers have some legal immunities and privileges related to their legislative activities, one law expert noted.\n\"Had he ever read the Constitution, Donald Trump would come across the Speech or Debate Clause, which\nprohibits prosecuting members of Congress for legislative acts,\" Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University's College of Law faculty, wrote Thursday on X.\nALSO READ:\n‘Journalistic dystopian nightmare’: Inside a Tennessee college media meltdown\nIn other words, the clause would ostensibly cover the lawmakers' work on the Jan. 6 committee.\nHere's the clause in question, which is found in\nArticle I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution:\n\"[Senators and Representatives] shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.\"\nReaction to Kreis' takedown included predictable jabs at the former president.\n\"\nDonald? Read?\" questioned one X user.\nAnother echoed the sentiment: \"Okay so first off you are\nassuming he can read…\"\nEven so, lawmakers who served on the House Select Committee that investigated the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 attack have\ntaken steps in recent months to prepare for Trump's potential deployment of the government to go after them if he's elected in November. That includes California Democrat Rep. Zoe Lofgren, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA).\n“If he intends to eliminate our constitutional system and start arresting his political enemies, I guess I would be on that list,” Lofgren told the Los Angeles Times earlier this year. “One thing I did learn on the committee is to pay attention and listen to what Trump says, because he means it.”\n“We’re taking this seriously, because we have to,” Schiff told the Times. “We’ve seen this movie before … and how perilous it is to ignore what someone is saying when they say they want to be a dictator.”",
