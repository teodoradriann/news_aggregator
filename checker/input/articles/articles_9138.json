    "text": "STEUBENVILLE, Ohio (Gray News/TMX) – A woman in Ohio claims her Stanley tumbler saved her from being hit by a stray bullet. A 22-year-old named Rachel posted about the Feb. 12 incident on TikTok, which has since gone viral. Rachel told TMX she and her fiancé David were inside their home in the city of Steubenville when they heard gunshots outside. She said they heard about seven or eight gunshots and then one “really loud bang” from a bullet that came through the wall of the house and ricocheted off her Stanley tumbler, which was sitting directly in front of her. After bouncing off the Stanley cup, the bullet changed direction and went through a bottle of perfume before landing on the kitchen floor, Rachel said. The couple said they hid until police officers arrived. Rachel’s video on TikTok documents the path of the bullet, showing the hole through her wall, the mark on her Stanley cup where the bullet bounced off, and the hole in her perfume bottle. The video also shows the bullet on her kitchen floor. While some TikTok users questioned the authenticity of the claims, Rachel posted a follow-up video showing police in her home, investigating the scene. Gray News has reached out to Steubenville police for comment. However, some fellow Stanley fans were not surprised to hear that their favorite cup was indestructible, even against a bullet. “Who needs body armor? Just grab your Stanley,” one TikTok user wrote. “I’m convinced Stanleys are immortal,” another wrote. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. TMX contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Barcelona are on track for the last four of the Women’s Champions League after the holders routed Wolfsburg 4-1, while Manchester City’s 2-0 win handed Chelsea their first defeat this season in Wednesday’s quarter-final first leg action.\nUnlike the 2023 Champions League final between the same two opponents, won narrowly 3-2 by Barcelona who came from two goals down, Wednesday’s last-eight clash was an uneven affair.\nA first-half own-goal by Caitlin Dijkstra, followed up by two strikes in quick succession in the second period by Irene Paredes and Salma Paralluelo put Barcelona firmly in control.\nJanina Minge pulled one back inside the final 15 minutes for hosts Wolfsburg, before Barcelona’s Sydney Schertenleib added a late fourth.\n“Wolfsburg are a really good team but we are confident in our game, in our team, in our players,” Paredes told UEFA.\n“We were so serious and we didn’t make mistakes – that’s key in this type of game. We always had to stay alert because they can play long balls and hurt us.”\nWolfsburg’s Minge told DAZN: “At times we felt like headless chickens on the pitch… in the second half, we were just chasing after them.”\nWinners of three of the past four Champions Leagues, Barcelona went ahead after 26 minutes when Ewa Pajor, who spent almost a decade at the German club, pressured Dijkstra into conceding an own goal from Aitana Bonmati’s cross.\nBarcelona took control of the tie with two goals in three minutes after the interval.\nParedes tapped in from close range after Wolfsburg failed to deal with Barcelona’s 50th-minute corner and just three minutes later Paralluelo’s finish capped an incisive raid from the visitors.\nMinge gave Wolfsburg hope when she headed in with 79 minutes gone, but Swiss teenager Schertenleib’s fine curling finish with two minutes remaining put Barcelona firmly in control of the tie.\nMiedema double If Barcelona can finish the job in the second leg, they will face the winners of Manchester City’s tie against Chelsea.\nCity hold the advantage after their dynamic display in Manchester avenged last weekend’s League Cup final defeat against Chelsea.\nWomen’s Super League leaders Chelsea are chasing a first Champions League trophy.\nBut Chelsea’s shock loss ended their 28-game unbeaten run in all competitions in Sonia Bompastor’s first season in charge, leaving their hopes of reaching the semi-finals hanging by a slender thread.\n“Tonight was a tough performance,” Bompastor said. “It’s the first time we have been beaten, so that’s not a drama.\n“We still have one game to reverse the situation and there is hope for us. Our ambitions are still there.”\nGiven the absence of key forward Khadija Shaw, it was an impressive result for City’s interim manager Nick Cushing, who took over from the sacked Gareth Taylor last week.\n“Tonight’s a massive boost because we’ve been getting a lot of knocks and are missing a lot of players, and this result gives us confidence,” Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema told TNT Sports.\nThis was the second of four successive meetings between the teams in the space of just 12 days, with a Super League clash looming on Sunday followed by the European second leg on March 27.\nCity took the lead on the hour when Mary Fowler’s cross caused havoc in the Chelsea defence and Miedema’s shot crashed in off the crossbar.\nMiedema struck again in the 89th minute when the substitute took Kerolin’s pass inside the area and drilled into the bottom corner.\nSports",

    "text": "Search efforts along the north fork of Eagle River were suspended Thursday, Dec. 28, 2023 for 45-year-old Amanda Richmond, who disappeared in the river as she tried to rescue her dog. (Courtesy Alaska Dive, Search, Rescue and Recovery Team Facebook page) Alaska State Troopers have suspended a four-day search for an Eagle River woman, last seen Saturday in the frozen river’s north fork trying to rescue a dog she was walking.\nTroopers said in a statement Thursday morning that active efforts to find 45-year-old Amanda Richmond have been called off, after extensive air and water searches with drones and sonar.\n“(S)earch teams have determined that there are no further areas of interest that are accessible to search at this time,” troopers said.\nThe Alaska Dive, Search, Rescue and Recovery Team said on Facebook Wednesday that its sector scan sonar system – a key piece of safety equipment for divers – was damaged during the search, with subzero temperatures taking a further toll on the team’s equipment.\nTroopers said Richmond, a male companion and her two dogs were walking along the North Fork Eagle River Trail at about 2:15 p.m. Saturday when one of the dogs went into a lead of open water on the river. The couple followed the dog into the river, but Richmond went under and never resurfaced.\nRichmond has been added to the Anchorage Police Department’s list of missing persons, troopers said. Law enforcement will launch new search efforts if new information or evidence on her whereabouts is received.\nChris Klint, Anchorage Chris Klint is a web producer and breaking news reporter at Alaska Public Media.
