    "text": "Women’s Basketball Fights Hard but Loses Close Match to Bellarmine\nNorth Florida women's basketball fought hard but fell short to Bellarmine, ending the game 80-69. The Ospreys came back from a 10-0 deficit to briefly take the lead but couldn't maintain their momentum in the final quarters. Freshman Jamisyn Stinson was the standout performer with 14 points, while Jasmynne Gibson contributed 10 points and seven rebounds. Despite the loss, the Ospreys showcased resilience against a tough opponent.\n- North Florida outscored Bellarmine 20-10 off turnovers, forcing 12 turnovers.\n- UNF scored 26 points in the paint and contributed 22 points from the bench.\nWhile UNF showed significant improvement by narrowing a past deficit, their inability to maintain leads in the second half raises concerns about consistency under pressure. The Ospreys' offensive struggles may indicate deeper issues in their late-game performance.\nState of Play- North Florida's record now stands at 4-18 with a winless ASUN record of 0-9.\n- Despite the loss, the team demonstrated notable offensive capability, particularly from their freshman players.\nThe Ospreys are set to face Eastern Kentucky next on February 1, where they will need to focus on maintaining offensive momentum and tightening their defense to secure their first conference win.\nBottom LineNorth Florida must build on their impressive moments of resilience and transform them into a full 40-minute performance. Consistency is key if the team aims to overcome their current losing streak and build momentum moving forward.\nRead more at University of North Florida Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "Mystery Object Captured By Fighter Pilot 'threatened Multiple Collisions' - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) Mystery object captured by fighter pilot ‘threatened multiple collisions’ A retired US Navy admiral has given ‘powerful testimony’ about an object filmed moving faster than any known human technology. Dr Tim Gallaudet told a [Congressional committee ](//metro.co.uk/2024/11/13/whistleblower-claims-us-possession-ufo-technology-21988503/)that he was on a Navy exercise off the country’s East Coast when he received an email on a secure internal network headed ‘URGENT SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE’. He described how the ‘brief but alarming’ message referred to ‘multiple near mid-air collisions’ with the mystery object and contained an attachment of what is now known as the [‘go fast’ video ](//metro.co.uk/2023/12/09/enhanced-game-changing-video-casts-new-light-pentagon-ufo-mystery-19942056/)captured on the forward-looking infrared sensor of an F/A-18 jet. The former rear admiral, appearing before the GOP Oversight Committee on [Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena](//metro.co.uk/2021/01/08/ufo-expert-says-clock-is-ticking-on-possible-seismic-revelations-13874364/) (UAP), said he and other commanders were told that if the anomaly was not identified then the pre-deployment exercise, which included the Theodore Rosevelt Carrier Strike Group, would have to be shut down. He told the hearing: ‘The now declassified video showed an unidentified object exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal. The implication of the email was clear. ‘The author was asking whether any of the recipients were aware of classified technology demonstrations that could explain these objects. ‘Because the DoD policy is to rigorously deconflict such demonstrations with live exercises I was confident this was not the case.’ Dr Galluadet, who is now CEO of Ocean STL Consulting, said that ‘the very next day’ in 2015 the email inexplicably disappeared from his account and those of the other recipients. At the time, he was responsible for ‘safety of flight risks’ for the Navy and was concerned that the pilots were being left to encounter UAPs ‘without guidance or support’. The disclosure advocate concluded that the information was so secret it had been compartmentalised by an intelligence agency at a level which even he had no access to. Giving evidence before the committee in Washington, he called for more scrutiny and transparency of government information about UAP for national security, public safety and socio-economic reasons. The former science agency leader appeared alongside former DoD official [Luis Elizondo,](//metro.co.uk/2024/08/21/pentagon-insider-says-secret-group-collected-alien-remains-50-years-21463523/) former NASA associate Michael Gold and [Michael Shellenberger, ](//metro.co.uk/2024/11/13/whistleblower-claims-us-possession-ufo-technology-21988503/)of the Public news service, at the hearing on Wednesday. Explaining his reasons for going public, Dr Galluadet said: ‘Now we know that UAP are interacting with humanity, and that includes unidentified submerged objects in the ocean, we should not turn a blind eye but instead boldly face this new reality and learn from it. ‘Additionally, at a time when leaders in government leave much to be desired, I feel obligated to show moral leadership on this issue of UAP disclosure by validating the credibility of the courageous men and women who come out as witnesses and whistleblowers to expose the truth.’ Last December, Metro[ told how the video and seven other clips showed UAP at speeds and angles beyond the limits](//metro.co.uk/2023/12/09/enhanced-game-changing-video-casts-new-light-pentagon-ufo-mystery-19942056/) of any known human-made craft. They have been hosted online by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), a team of experts who are leading the US government’s efforts to address the issue. In the go fast video, an astounded US Navy F/A-18 pilot can be heard shouting ‘woah got it, woohoo!’ as the Hornet jet’s targeting system captures a low-flying circular object during a training flight in 2015. Amid excited radio chatter, he exclaims: ‘What the hell is that?’ A second video filmed the same year by an F/A-18 crew shows a small black blob – seemingly with no propulsion – moving above the cloud base. The object can be seen changing angles, with one pilot saying over the radio: ‘There’s a whole fleet of them, look on the ASA [airborne surveillance and attack system].’ His colleague remarks: ‘They are going against the wind, the wind’s 120 knots to the west.’ The first pilot then exclaims: ‘Look at that thing dude.’ Another sequence in the AARO footage refreshed by UK-based videographer Evan Brindle shows a mystery object flashing by a Navy fighter jet pilot’s cockpit during a flight in 2021. The unexplained anomaly is almost too fast to see in the colour video, but freeze-framing shows a small, metallic-type object with a white blob, possibly from the sun’s reflection. The AARO has said that the clip ‘demonstrates the typical speed at which military aircraft may approach an unknown object’. In another video, shot from an MQ-9 Reaper drone, a silver, orb-like object is shown flying over sparsely populated desert terrain in the Middle East. Filmed in December 2022 at an undisclosed location, the object was not exhibiting ‘anomalous behaviour’ – such as propulsion beyond known technology – but remains unidentified, according to the AARO. The other cases involving fighter pilots are unresolved. [Nick Pope](//metro.co.uk/2021/01/08/ufo-expert-says-clock-is-ticking-on-possible-seismic-revelations-13874364/), who investigated UFOs for the UK Ministry of Defence, told Metro: ‘Tim Gallaudet is an unimpeachable witness – a dedicated professional of the highest integrity. His powerful testimony deepens the mystery over the go fast video and adds important new details. ‘It shows that the very people best able to judge the most advanced US military technologies — by virtue of the fact that they were testing and exercising with them — were foxed by these events, and couldn’t reconcile what was being seen and filmed with anything in their inventory. ‘These same people also know, from intelligence gathering, the likely extent of aircraft, missile and drone technologies in the possession of adversaries such as China or Russia.’ Mr Pope pointed to ‘numerous’ similar incidents which he believes should be made public due to the national security implications. ‘It’s one thing to hear such things on internet conspiracy forums, but it’s quite another to hear them in Congress, under oath, from a retired US Navy Admiral,’ he said. ‘If ever an incident highlights the serious defense, national security and flight safety implications of UAP, this is it. ‘And, of course, what we heard in Congress is only the tip of the iceberg. ‘There are numerous similar incidents and associated footage that have yet to be declassified and released.’ The Navy videos were originally leaked into the public domain between 2007 and 2017 before the Department of Defense’s release in 2020. The Pentagon said at the time that the authorised disclosure was ‘to clear up any misconceptions by the public’ about whether the footage was real or ‘whether or not there is more to the videos’. Mr Pope has previously called on the UK government to disclose more about what it knows and is possibly doing about UAP. In response to Freedom of Information Act requests, the Ministry of Defence has not acknowledged any engagement with the US over the issue [but did say it was ‘aware’ of one report](//metro.co.uk/?page_id=19942217&preview_id=19942217) from across the Atlantic. ‘These objects were in restricted airspace and reportedly ran rings around the cutting edge of US aerospace technology,’ Mr Pope said. ‘The US and the UK need to collaborate on a proper reinvestigation of these videos and of other anomalous objects in US and UK airspace. ‘The UK Ministry of Defence has access to world class intelligence community imagery analysis resources and capabilities that can help with this. The US Congress is actively investigating various UFO-related data: photos, videos, documents and whistleblower testimony. ‘The UK is lagging shamefully behind in the quest for the truth about UFOs, but one or two proactive parliamentarians could seize on these new video analyses and use them to reignite the debate about arguably the greatest mystery of the modern era.’ Established in 2022, the AARO aims to ‘mitigate the potential threats to safety and security posed by UAP’ by improving data and reporting. A wide remit held by the office covers ‘objects or devices’ in the air, space and sea which are ‘not yet attributable to known actors’. The MoD’s existing position on UFOs, referring to a now-defunct UFO desk, states: ‘Since 2009 the MoD no longer responds to reported UFO sightings or investigates them as, in over 50 years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. ‘The MOD UFO desk was closed because it served no defence purpose and was taking staff away from more valuable defence-related activities. ‘There was/is no defence benefit in such investigations and therefore, it was, and is, an inappropriate use of defence resources.’ Do you have a story you would like to share?

    "title": "Deeper Dive Into the Gut Microbiome Shows Changes Linked to Body Weight",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (April 18, 2024) -- Cedars-Sinai investigators have identified significant variations in the microbes of the small bowel (small intestine) are strongly associated with various body weights, from a normal body mass index, or BMI, to having obesity. The gut microbiome includes the bacteria, fungi, and viruses that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. Imbalances in these microbial populations have previously been observed in the stool samples of patients with obesity-related diseases. This is the first study to fully examine the small bowel microbiome in normal weight, overweight and obesity, according to investigators. “Using specialized techniques, we did a deeper dive into the microbial universe and found the small bowel was significantly, and specifically, altered in participants who were overweight or had obesity, when compared to those of normal weight. Some of these changes were progressive, moving from normal weight to overweight to having obesity,” said endocrinologist [Ruchi Mathur, MD](https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Ruchi.Mathur?ppn=Y3Mtb3JnOmNlZGFycy1zaW5haTpwcm92aWRlcjpydWNoaS1tYXRodXItODI4MDc5), a professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and corresponding author of the study. The paper is published in the [American Journal of Gastroenterology](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/abstract/9900/characterization_of_the_small_bowel_microbiome.1104.aspx). “Many functions related to food metabolism and nutrient absorption converge in the small bowel, as do many endocrine and immune functions that may influence weight gain. We think that changes in the balances of small bowel microbial populations may have a greater impact on weight gain and the development of obesity than previously understood,” said Mathur, also the director of the [Diabetes Outpatient Teaching Education Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/locations/webb-family-diabetes-center-166.html). Using specimens obtained from [esophagogastroduodenoscopies](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/tests-and-procedures/u/upper-gi-endoscopy.html), blood samples and patient questionnaires, investigators examined the small bowel microbiomes of 214 patients stratified by body mass index. Study participants were classified according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines of a normal weight having a BMI of 18.5-24.9, overweight individuals a BMI of 25-29.9, and for those classified as having obesity, with a BMI of 30 or higher. The microbial populations of the duodenum, the first part of the small bowel where nutrition absorption begins, were analyzed in all three groups. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of all the organisms present. “A key finding was that one bacterial population, Lactobacillus, in the duodenum exhibited differing and highly species-specific associations in subjects classified as overweight or having obesity. These microbiome changes related to weight gain may be of particular importance because many people regularly consume Lactobacillus-containing products, including dairy-based foods, probiotics and certain vegan cuisine such as fermented tempeh,” said Gabriela Leite, PhD, the lead author of the study and lead project scientist for Cedars-Sinai’s [Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program](https://csmast.com/). An estimated 182 million adults in the U.S. are overweight or have obesity, according to the CDC. The global number exceeds 1 billion. The causes are multifactorial and associated with serious health problems, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. Genetics, epigenetics, gut hormones and gut microbiomes are involved in the pathophysiology of obesity, which can also be influenced by socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Investigators believe understanding the influences and activity of the microbes that populate our small bowel microbiome may offer an important path to improving the health and lives of millions of people. “Identifying changes in the populations, and activity, of small bowel microbial species associated with overweight or having obesity is part of a key initiative to develop new therapeutic targets and to personalize medicine,” said gastroenterologist and study co-author [Mark Pimentel, MD](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/mark-pimentel-887112.html), executive director of Cedars-Sinai’s MAST Program. “More research will be needed to identify the cause-and-effect relationships between the changes we observed, but the goal is to develop treatments and interventions that help people lower their risk for obesity-related disease and improve their overall health,” Pimentel said.

Photos in the post announcing the reopening showed people already enjoying the snow-covered hill.\nThe Bavarian mountain town is a popular winter destination, especially over the holiday break.\nOn Saturday around 11:30 p.m., a truck was captured on video driving through the Front Street Park lawn, sending icy mud flying and crashing into nearby snow drifts.\nA 90 foot by 50 foot section of the park lawn was damaged by the vehicle, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said. At the time, the city described the park as \"unusable, unsafe, and severely damaged.\"\nThe park was temporarily closed following the incident and city employees worked to restore the park throughout the week, as conditions allowed.\nThe Chelan County Sheriff’s Department confirmed the incident is under investigation.\nLaw enforcement told KING 5 the pickup that caused the damage appears to be a 2024 silver Toyota Tundra with the Texas license plate TTR1528. The driver appears to be a man in his 20s to 30s. He has not been identified.\nOnce the driver is identified, police expect probable cause will be found for reckless driving and second-degree malicious mischief.\nAnyone with information about the incident or the suspect driver should contact the Chelan County Sheriff's Office at (509) 667-6845.",

    "text": "Temporal La DANA roza Ibiza y la Aemet sube la alerta a naranja Fuertes lluvias en algunos puntos de la isla desde primera hora de la mañana La Aermet prevé precipitaciones acumuladas de hasta 50 litros en una hora Fernando de Lama La [DANA que ha golpeado en los últimos días todo el litoral mediterráneo](/sociedad/2024/10/30/alerta-dana-temporal-levante-valencia-alicante-murcia-malaga-castellon-110879946.html) español sigue activa y en las últimas horas se ha situado en el mar al norte de la isla. Aemet ha elevado la alerta amarilla a naranja porque se prevén episodios de alrededor de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. El riesgo naranja permanecerá activo hasta las 20 horas de este viernes día festivo de Tots Sants. Las lluvias han descargado con fuerza en algunos puntos de la isla desde primera hora de la mañana, ya que la tormenta ha barrido buena parte de la isla. Sobre todo en la zona norte, con chubascos potentes en la zona de Sant Vicent, Sant Joan y entre Santa Agnès y Sant Mateu. Pero también se han producido lluvias intensas en otros puntos, como el Pla de Sant Antoni, en Santa Eulària hacia el interior e incluso en puntos aislados de Sant Josep y en la ciudad de Eivissa, donde se han producido algunas inundaciones. También en las últimas horas se han producido tormentas en Formentera. No circular por las carreteras Se recomienda no estar en zonas inundables ni utilizar las carreteras, ya que es un fenómeno impredecible que puede descargar tormentas y provocar inundaciones en pocos minutos. Desde las 9 de la mañana también han descargado decenas de rayos en diferentes puntos de la isla. Aunque el grueso de la [DANA](/tags/dana/) sigue afectando desde anoche principalmente a la zona de Castellón y el Sur de Tarragona, se ha ido desplazando hacia el Mediterráneo y un frente está situado durante toda la madrugada y la mañana entre Ibiza y Mallorca. El Govern pide \"máxima prudencia\" Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca y Menorca. Recomendaciones para la alerta naranja - Planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables. - En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa. - Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa. - En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay. - Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición. - No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. - Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.

    "text": "The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates fireworks were responsible for at least 1,900 hundred injuries and 11 deaths nationwide last year. With the New Year’s holiday approaching, a Tampa Fire Rescue investigator is offering important safety tips to help residents celebrate the holiday safely and responsibly.\nFireworks accidents led to 10,000 emergency room visits in 2022 “Fireworks are a big deal and a big problem when it comes to an urban environment and shooting fireworks in that environment,” said Tampa Fire Rescue Lt. Frank Rosete. Rosete is the on-call fire investigator assigned to work New Year’s Eve. He said if the past is any indication, he’ll be busy. “I personally go on at least four to five calls related to fireworks,” he said when asked what a typical year looks like in Tampa. Rosete said most of the fires and injuries his department has responded to in the past are preventable.\nAccording to the Consumer Product Safety Commission , more than 10,000 people were treated in emergency rooms for fireworks injuries nationwide last year. Of those, 600 were burned by sparklers. “Adolescents 15 and under are the most injured from the sparklers because they run around. They play sword fights with each other,” Rosete said. “We could have lost him” Other injuries were caused by people re-lighting fireworks that didn’t ignite. “The time you decide to reignite it could be the time it decides to explode,” Rosete said. That happened to a man in Dade City in 2019. “We could have all lost him last night over a firework,” the accident victim’s girlfriend, Ashley Nicholls, said at the time. He was seriously injured after lighting a firework he found on the side of the road. “He lit it, and it blew up in his hand. He blew his thumb off. He broke his finger,” Nicholls said. Rosete said if you plan to launch your own fireworks, have a fire extinguisher or bucket of water close by. And he reminds people that drinking or drugging and explosives aren’t a good combination. “Kind of like a designated driver, have a designated shooter. That he or she is not gonna be under the impairment of an alcoholic beverage,” Rosete said. Leave it to professionals Rosete said it’s always better to leave something as dangerous as fireworks to those who really know what they’re doing. “There is opportunity to go see fireworks at a professional shoot versus you trying to do it at home and run the risk of injuring yourself or others or burning your property down,” he said. Here are some important fireworks safety tips for you to consider if you plan to shoot fireworks this New Year’s Eve.

    "text": "Catch up quickly with the stories from Central and Eastern Europe that matter, this week led by news of Russia closing in on the Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk. Russia’s war on Ukraine As Ukraine raids Russia, it is losing a key battle at home. Authorities this week urged civilians in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk to evacuate immediately in the face of rapidly advancing Russian forces, while Moscow claimed to have repelled an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the border region of Bryansk. Communities in and around Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine, are being urged to flee within the next two weeks as Russian forces are rapidly advancing. “Don’t wait. It will not get better, it will only get worse. Leave.” That was the stark warning of local official Yurii Tretiak, the head of the military administration in the town of Myrnohrad, which is now less than 4.8 kilometres from the frontline. There are nearly 59,000 residents in the entire community, which encompasses Pokrovsk City, Myrnohrad town and 39 surrounding villages, according to the Pokrovsk City military administration. Roughly 600 to 700 people have been evacuating daily, the administration said. The evacuations come as Ukraine’s Armed forces said Wednesday that Pokrovsk is now “the hottest” front of the war. “The situation in the Pokrovsk sector remains tense. Ukrainian troops repelled 11 attacks, fighting continues in four locations,” Ukraine’s Armed Forced said in the latest update. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces are being reinforced in the eastern region to repel a potential Russian advance. Western suppliers should let Ukraine fire their powerful long-range weapons at targets in Russia, Josep Borrell said on Wednesday. Borrell—who, as the EU’s foreign policy chief, counts as its top diplomat—argued for “lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities vs the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law”. It would “strengthen Ukrainian self defence by ending Russia’s sanctuary for its attacks” as well as saving lives and advancing peace efforts. Borrell said the matter would be on the agenda for discussions during back-to-back meetings of EU foreign and defence ministers taking place on August 29-30 in Brussels, involving Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. After speaking with Kuleba, Borrell also said Ukraine’s Kursk counteroffensive had dealt a “severe blow” to Vladimir Putin’s war narrative. The Ukrainian parliament this week approved legislation banning religious organisations with ties to Russia, paving the way for Kyiv to end the activities of the Moscow-linked orthodox church on its soil. The Verkhovna Rada approved the law on Tuesday in its second and final reading, with 265 lawmakers voting in its favour and 29 against, according to MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak. Ukrainian officials have long argued that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) operates as an arm of the Russian Orthodox Church to undermine Ukraine and that it is complicit in Russia’s full-scale war. In particular, Ukrainian officials accuse the UOC-MP of working closely with Russia’s powerful security service, the FSB. “The Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with faith — it is a tool of the special services,” Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, wrote on Telegram. Other news from the region The European Commission is steadfast in its intention to pursue a strategic partnership on raw materials with Serbia despite concerns over President Aleksandar Vučić’s claims that western powers lie behind widespread protests against a planned lithium mine. The Commission remains “fully committed” to the partnership—the latest in over a dozen Brussels has signed to reduce dependence on China for access to the critical raw materials essential for electric car batteries and Europe’s ongoing energy transition—spokesperson for trade Johanna Bernsel said on Tuesday. Interim Bulgarian Prime Minister Goritsa Grancharova-Kozhareva told local media on Monday that there was pressure on her to choose particular ministers in her proposed cabinet which earlier in the day had been unexpectedly rejected by President Rumen Radev. As a result of the presidential veto, itself an unprecedented move, the new interim PM has to draft a new cabinet—meaning that the next general election in Bulgaria will be rescheduled from October 20 to a later date. It will be the country’s seventh general election in three years. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-20/romanian-prime-minister-ciolacu-announces-bid-for-presidency he’ll be a candidate in presidential elections later this year, a move that may strain ties between the two main parties of the governing coalition. The 56-year-old leader announced his bid on Tuesday in a audio recording sent to his party members and obtained by the G4Media news website. The decision to run follows pressure from his Social Democrats to put himself forward for a post that the party hasn’t occupied in two decades. Ciolacu’s move pits him against National Liberal Party leader Nicolae Ciuca, who has already announced his presidential bid. Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani this week https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-serbia-osmani-mitrovica-bridge-kurti-vucic/33084758.html that Kosovo is in consultations with the international community on opening the main bridge in Mitrovica that divides ethnic Albanian and Serbian communities. Osmani told RFE/RL in an interview that opening the bridge, which has been a point of contention because of concerns that it would increase already high ethnic tensions, is a priority and could turn into a “symbol of normalisation” in relations between Kosovo and Serbia. The bridge divides the Albanian-majority southern side and a Serb-majority northern side of the city. Georgian authorities have yet to demonstrate that they are conducting effective investigations into a spate of violent attacks on civic and political activists over recent months, Human Rights Watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/08/20/georgia-violent-attacks-government-critics this week. “A pattern of harassment and intimidation of activists, independent media, and government critics, if left unpunished, risk emboldening malicious actors to escalate violence in the months before Georgia’s upcoming elections,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Georgia is set to hold a crucial parliamentary election at the end of October. Jailed war criminal Radovan Karadžić is suing the UK government claiming he suffers inhumane treatment—as he’s not allowed a laptop in his cell. The tyrant, dubbed The Butcher of Bosnia, wants 50,000 UK pounds for human rights breaches. He claims he has also been banned from communicating in his native Serbian and denied food needed to control his diabetes. Former Bosnian Serb leader Karadžić, 79, is in Albany prison on the Isle of Wight having been convicted in 2019 of genocide against Croats and Muslims during the Balkans War. Bookbot, a Czech online platform for second-hand books, this week announced a four million euros Series A funding round at a valuation of over 20 million euros. The round was led by new investor Genesis Growth Equity Fund I with the participation of existing shareholder Miton. Since its foundation in 2019 Bookbot has been a rapidly unfolding success story that has made it the biggest seller of second-hand books in Czechia. Bookbot expanded to Slovakia in 2022, to Austria in the summer of 2023 and to Germany in the fall of 2023. The investment is dedicated to accelerate growth in the DACH market. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) this week https://www.adb.org/news/adb-help-strengthen-resilience-rural-women-tajikistan a 17.5 million US dollars grant to help improve women’s agricultural skills and boost food security in Tajikistan. The Resilient Livelihoods and Empowerment of Rural Women Project aims to improve productivity of women-led farms, strengthen agriculture processing and storage facilities, and enhance support to vulnerable women in six districts of Khatlon, the country’s most populous province and biggest agricultural producer. “ADB invests in women as agents of change,” said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov.

    "text": "The foal was found seriously ill after the RSPCA received welfare concerns (Image: RSPCA) A woman has been given a 16-week suspended prison sentence after failing to give her extremely ill foal veterinary treatment.\nCricket, aged between six and eight months old, was found tethered in a field in Castleford, West Yorkshire, on January 13 after the RSPCA responded to welfare concerns.\nThe foal was found lethargic and wobbly on his feet, with no food, water or shelter available. He weighed just 85kg when he should have weighed nearer 150kg given his age.\nCarol Summers, from Castleford, has now been banned from keeping animals for ten years after she admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the foal and failing to meet his needs following a prosecution by the RSPCA.\nAt a sentencing hearing at Kirklees Magistrates Court on 6 December, she was also handed a 16-week prison sentence, which the bench suspended for 12 months.\nThe court heard how RSPCA inspector Kris Walker had visited the field and seen multiple tethered horses but one in particular raised concern.\nIn a statement to the court he said: \"I saw a tethered young colt. He did not look any older than eight to ten-months-old. He was lethargic, wobbly on his feet and very thin with his hips and spine all prominent. The rug he was wearing was too big for him and not on properly. He was scouring badly. There was no food, water or shelter readily available for him and he should not have been tethered due to his young age.\"\nA vet was called out immediately to examine Cricket. She gave him a body score of just one out of nine and said he was suffering from dehydration, hyperthermia and diarrhoea and needed urgent veterinary care. The police took the foal into possession and arrangements were made to transport him for treatment. He was so thirsty he was drinking from the nearest puddle.\nSummers arrived on the scene and was told Cricket had been seized by the police and an investigation would be started. She agreed to sign him over into the care of the RSPCA, telling inspector Walker she'd owned the foal for six weeks. She also told the inspector that a vet had prescribed steroids to treat Cricket, although no record of this was found.\nCricket was initially taken to a nearby veterinary practice before being transferred to a specialist equine hospital. A vet who gave evidence as part of the case said: \"There was no shelter available for the foal and no water was provided. Cricket should have been provided with ad-libitum water, especially given that he was sick with diarrhoea and so had a higher demand for water intake.\"\nDespite receiving extensive ongoing treatment and care, Cricket's condition sadly did not improve in the weeks that followed and a vet made the decision that it was in his best interest to put him down to prevent further suffering.\nThe court heard that despite Summers telling the RSPCA inspector she had owned Cricket for six weeks, she later disputed this and said it had only been three. However, she agreed she had assumed ownership and had failed to get the foal the care he needed and he had suffered unnecessarily as a result.\nIn addition to the suspended 16 week custodial sentence - to run concurrently for each offence - Summers was also ordered to complete 15 RAR days and pay costs of £400 and a victim surcharge of £154. She will not be able to appeal her ban for the next five years.\nMagistrates said Cricket's basic needs had not been met and there was a failure by the defendant in all aspects of horse ownership.\nRelated articles The European city where wild boars are causing havoc as they run riot Ancient humans would have met 'most terrifying predators of all time' in America Pet owners issued warning over 'worrying' trend at UK vets Model outraged after facing a year in jail over topless dog walk The full story behind the rumour of EU pet tax as it creates panic on TikTok Become an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial",
