    "title": "Government Viability Gap Fund To Boost Offshore Wind Energy",
    "text": "The Government has signed off on a viability gap funding (VGF) scheme worth Rs 7,453 crore ($890 million) to promote offshore wind energy projects to accelerate the exploitation of India's massive offshore wind energy potential.\nWith an ambitious target, the funding includes Rs 6,853 crore (~$820 million) specifically dedicated to the installation and commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind energy projects, 500 MW each off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, reports Down to Earth.\nAdditionally, Rs 600 crore ($70 million) has been allocated for the upgrading the critical Pipavav and Thoothukudi ports to support the logistical needs of these groundbreaking projects.\nThe Indian offshore wind market is very attractive because, unlike many other offshore markets worldwide, the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Union Ministry of Power are responsible for the cost and construction of the entire power evacuation infrastructure.\nThe Government's VGF provides financial support to make infrastructure projects commercially attractive for private investment. For example, wind energy installations benefit from this support due to high initial costs. The initiative is expected to generate substantial environmental benefits, such as reducing 2.98 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually over 25 years through offshore wind projects.\nFurthermore, this scheme is projected to create a robust ecosystem for offshore wind energy, facilitating the development of an initial 37 GW of power with an estimated investment of Rs 4,500 billion. This foundational ecosystem is vital for enhancing India’s ocean-based economic activities (blue economy) and achieving long-term sustainability goals.\nThe upgraded port facilities will ensure the efficient transport and installation of heavy and large-dimension equipment, which is crucial for the smooth execution of offshore projects.\nThese projects will be executed by private developers selected through a bidding process, ensuring efficiency and cost competitiveness. The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited will construct the necessary power evacuation infrastructure, including offshore substations.\nConcerns persist about whether the VGF amount is sufficient for IPPs to generate and sell offshore wind power at competitive rates to state DISCOMs. The PPA tariff is critical, as current rates may not fully cover costs without additional support during implementation.\nSeveral steps are being considered to address this issue, including waiving customs duty on offshore wind turbine generators (WTGs), submarine cables, and foundations. The supply chain for these components is not currently well-established in India.\nThe MNRE may either (a) extend the RLMM waiver to offshore wind turbines set up in the Exclusive Economic Zone of India or (b) provide higher tariff restrictions to encourage European, American and Chinese offshore Wind turbine manufacturers to manufacture in India.\nIn addition to financial support, some associated regulatory challenges are expected, and further discussion by market entities is needed. The support measures should directly address power procurement risks from DISCOMS and define various environmental standards for offshore wind, which will strengthen India's wind energy value chain.\nMore specific allocation of the VGF can be directed towards Gujaratto promote balanced development. This will encourage market development with emerging power infrastructure, leading to further market deepening and the discovery of resource sites. Project developers also suggest reducing timelines to 10 years.\nLand use for wind energy poses challenges in site acquisition, regulatory approvals, and cost management; it's crucial to explore offshore resources. Developing ocean-based wind energy projects offers greater economic value and could unlock 36 GW of offshore energy generation potential. Without reforms, generators face increased risks, and power purchase from offshore projects isn't guaranteed by DISCOMS, leading investors to rely on independent power producers.\nThe development of offshore activities comes under the ambit of India's Exclusive Economic Zone rules that govern exploration and extraction. Current rules restrict movement, which may enhance the cost-effectiveness of construction and installations, such as specialised marine vessels to construct large turbines and offshore platforms.\nThe offshore presence of personnel from multiple nationalities poses national security risks. Therefore, discussions with relevant agencies are crucial for long-term project viability in the Indian Ocean. This will promote India's Blue Economy potential by increasing the manufacturing of marine vessels, creating skilled jobs, and boosting direct exports.\nEnabling sectoral policies for domestic manufacturing, processing, exports, logistics, transport, employment generation, and Indian Ocean security will make India self-reliant in offshore wind energy. The National Institute of Wind Energy's institutional capacity needs enhancement, with offices in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu connecting to maritime, fisheries, and environment departments to streamline project processes. Collaboration with renewable energy and coastline management departments is crucial.",

    "title": "The Value of a Light, Simple Aircraft",
    "text": "Simple, light, and affordable is not a throwaway line. Each word is pivotal.\nLike many of you, I have enjoyed the advancing development of the light sport aircraft space, leading to MOSAIC LSA in about 15 months. Additional operational capabilities, plus features like autopilot, synthetic vision, and powerful, compact engines, all can build a very exciting airplane.\nWith MOSAIC, the list gets even longer: more weight, more seats, more powerful engines, plus retractable gear, adjustable props, even aerial work for entrepreneurs. Wonderful, I agree. Some pilots have asked for more and industry members, with the FAA, have been working to achieve these potentials.\nYet this is a path to ever-more complex (and expensive) aircraft. Have you been waiting for MOSAIC LSA? If yes, your wishes may be answered in 15 months. If not, please continue reading.\nSimple\nSometimes I find my attention returning to the easy pleasures of sightseeing around the local area, basic stick-and-rudder flying, feeling the air.\nWhile features like modern economic autopilots make cross-country flights easier, operational procedures for sophisticated instrumentation absorb my time. Using this great gear becomes almost second nature, a muscle memory, if you fly often. Yet, as with apps on your computer or device, you must invest time to keep up with software changes and the particulars of operating digital avionics offered by Garmin, Dynon, MGL, and Kanardia (among others).\nI applaud study and learning. These make your flying safer and more enjoyable. But time spent poring over manuals and software upgrade installation necessarily takes time away from simply going up for a fun hour in the sky.\nMy real joy in flight is simply looking around, aerial sightseeing, enjoying the view of my surroundings from a airborne platform few other humans will ever experience. I don’t need autopilot for that. As much as any phase of flight, I thoroughly enjoy a series of takeoffs and landings, honing my skills. For that I don’t need a fast aircraft and I don’t need to carry anything with me so payload is less important.\nFor the visceral joy of flight, you may find it optimal to, well, keep it simple. The more capability you add to an aircraft, the more you have to manage, pay for, stay updated on, maintain, insure, and all the rest. Complex aircraft that can do many things will demand more of owner and pilot. They can deliver much more but you have to keep up with them.\nAviating can be simply about the physical act of flying. It doesn’t all have to be about sleek designs, cool tech, or powerful engines.\nThen, cost. Buying and maintaining increasingly complex aircraft is its own taskmaster. While maintaining even the simplest aircraft is still vitally important, we do now have choices in very light electric aircraft that require far less maintenance, not to mention no oil spills. Plus, your neighbors will hardly know you’re flying.\nToday, not in some indistinct future, you can buy and fly an electric aircraft. I don’t doubt electric motors will power larger aircraft in the future, but who wants to wait—and who will be able to afford the batteries needed to provide four-seat cross-country flying?\nIf your goal is some delicious airtime on a calm, sunny afternoon, the simplest aircraft are darn hard to beat. Plus, they cost a lot less.\nLight\nLight is a key ingredient in keeping aircraft affordable. Require more material inputs, and you increase costs in a multitude of ways. Physically larger, heavier aircraft cost more—maybe a lot more. You’ll need more power, and your skill set must be kept in tighter tune. True, light aircraft are more affected by turbulent air. So what? If it’s that kind of air, I might choose to ride my bike rather than fly.\nLight also means using less fuel, which will continue increasing in price. Every government seems to fantasize about an all-electric future. Whether an improvement or not, it ain’t happening tomorrow when the flying is great. A lighter ICE aircraft sips fuel at a far slower rate but that airframe may also be fitted with electric propulsion, today. Several brands offer an electric option. How many four-seat electric aircraft have you seen? Yeah, me too. None. Heavier aircraft will be a far greater challenge to electrify.\nAffordable\nAffordable is a major focus of this website. If you can’t afford it, then you are somewhat doing a Walter Mitty, dreaming about owning some shiny new speedster that you may never buy. If you can’t afford flying, you won’t fly, or will fly less. Those aren’t good choices.\nYet keeping an airplane’s cost affordable means not having every feature imaginable. The very best airplane in the world may be the one you can actually buy, maintain, and have the pilot chops to enjoy.\nAll this is so basic, so simple, that you may wonder: why bother writing about it? As I contemplate what MOSAIC will deliver, I feel good about the new choices pilots will have. If your budget allows a new MOSAIC LSA, great! If not, you may need to make other selections. Fortunately, you have plenty of choices.\nAs the new year arrives, we face complicated times. Elections (all over the globe), multiple wars, unbelievable amounts of government debt (also around the world), and ever-expanding regulation mean the challenges to keep flying may be great.\nWith all that in mind, how about a nice hour-long sunset flight in an aircraft your budget can cover. What could be finer?\nI hope you enjoy all the flying you can afford in 2024!",

    "text": "The Okhla barrage saw a significant increase in Yamuna water discharge on Wednesday night around 11pm, recording a flow of 19,364 cusecs, which is four times higher than that the previous day, following heavy rain in Noida, Delhi and other parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), officials at the irrigation department said, while ruling out any risk of flooding in the Yamuna floodplains in Noida.On Tuesday afternoon, the water discharge was recorded at 4,938 cusecs, and on Thursday around 3pm, the discharge was recorded at 9,922 cusecs, officials said.Another official posted at the Okhla barrage said the downstream and upstream level of the Yamuna was recorded at 195.05m and 201.35 metres, respectively, on Wednesday, indicating a mere 10cm rise in water levels since heavy rain lashed NCR. “This increment normally happens due to rain and only if the Hathnikund barrage releases more water will there be a chance of flooding,” a second official said.The Okhla barrage’s capacity by design is 300,000 cusecs and the danger level is 202.50 metres.“Upstream and downstream levels don’t hold any ground when only four gates are operational at the barrage. In case it’s a free flow (where all the gates are open), only then do these levels matter... but here it is non-relevant and don’t pose any risk. Water levels increase here when the Hathnikund barrage releases more water and since there is not much release of water from there, a question of flood doesn’t arise....so there is nothing to worry for the people,” the second official said, asking not to be named.",
