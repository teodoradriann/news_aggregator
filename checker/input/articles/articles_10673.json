    "title": "Iranians mourn commander killed in Israeli strike - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "TEHRAN: Thousands massed on Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike. The crowd in Tehran’s central Imam Hossein square chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”. Many waved yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent” — a reference to Israel — in both Persian and Hebrew. Israel has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi’s killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Israeli aggression against Gaza. Some of the mourners in Tehran carried pictures of Moussavi together with the revered Qasem Soleimani, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Iran next week will mark the fourth anniversary of the death of Soleimani, who had run the IRGC’s Quds Force for more than a decade. Iranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday near the Syrian capital Damascus killed Moussavi, a Quds Force general and the most senior Guards commander killed since Soleimani. The Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports. Syria on Thursday said Moussavi’s “martyrdom” on its territory was part of Israel’s “aggressive policies”, official news agency SANA reported. In letters sent by the Syrian foreign ministry, Damascus called on the United Nations to act against Israeli actions which might “ignite the region”, SANA said.

    "text": "The North Vancouver RCMP says a man has been handed a six-month sentence in connection with a series of break-ins last year. Mounties say they began an investigation after police received multiple reports between March and June of 2023. In early March of last year, officers were called to an underground parking lot, where they discovered several vehicles that had been broken into. A suspect was identified with the help of surveillance footage. In May, the RCMP received reports of a break and enter at an Edgemont Village business. A suspect was arrested with “several iPads stolen from the business,” Mounties explain. Then, just over a month later, police were called to a Marine Drive dealership parking lot for reports of a “suspicious male.” The RCMP says, in this case, several vehicles had again been broken into. A suspect was arrested in this instance as well. Police say Cole Lambert was found guilty on April 18 of this year, after being charged with two counts of break and enter and one count of theft under $5,000. He was handed six months in jail and was given credit for 69 days in custody pre-sentence.",

    "text": "Dressed in black, holding swaddled fake babies, hundreds of protesters took part in a symbolic funeral procession through New York's iconic avenues on Thursday to demand a ceasefire and an end to Israel's devastating bombardment of Gaza. To the sound of drums, the procession silently followed a \"Ceasefire Now\" banner to Times Square, one of the beating hearts of Manhattan, a neighborhood known for its giant advertising screens and popular with tourists. Demonstrators also held photos of Palestinian children who had died in Gaza.\n\"We want to draw attention to the fact that to date, nearly 10,000 children, if you count only children, have been killed in Gaza, because of this horrific bombing and assault, which continues unabated,\" said Grace Lile, a 64-year-old archivist. Since the beginning of the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, following the bloody attack launched on October 7 by Hamas, New York has lived to the rhythm of actions in support of the Palestinians or Israel. These protests included Jewish Hanukkah and Catholic Christmas celebrations in the multicultural megacity of 8.5 million people.\nHundreds of demonstrators took part in a symbolic funeral procession in New York on Thursday to demand a ceasefire and an end to Israel's devastating bombardment of Gaza. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP\n'The humanity of the people of Gaza' A total of 21,320 people, mostly women, children and teenagers, have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israeli military operations, according to the Hamas Health Ministry, which has ruled the Palestinian territory under Israeli blockade for 16 years. In Israel, the October 7 attack killed about 1140,250 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. About 129 people were kidnapped by Hamas, <> of whom remain in Gaza custody.\nStephen Yankou, a 39-year-old school teacher, said he hoped \"the march can speak to people and force them to face the humanity of the people of Gaza, the Palestinians, and everyone in the region, all peoples.\" The protesters also hope to put pressure on the US government, Israel's main ally, which has vetoed UN Security Council resolutions calling for a humanitarian \"ceasefire\" in Gaza.\nThe protesters were holding fake babies in swaddling clothes. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP\nSince the beginning of the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, New York has lived to the rhythm of actions in support of the Palestinians or Israel. EDUARDO MUNOZ/REUTERS\nAfter more than two and a half months of war, nearly two million people have been displaced, or 85% of the population, according to the UN, which continues to warn of worsening \"hunger and despair\" in Gaza, which is totally besieged by Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has been criticized by the Democrats' most left-wing supporters for his staunch support for Israel, also warned his ally of an erosion of international support because of the \" indiscriminate\" bombing of Gaza.",

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link) Le président américain Joe Biden lors d'une conférence de presse en marge du G7, le 13 juin 2024 à Savelletri, en Italie Le président américain Joe Biden a assuré jeudi qu'il ne gracierait pas son fils Hunter, jugé coupable aux Etats-Unis de détention illégale d'arme à feu, sur fond d'addiction au crack. \"Non\", a répondu M. Biden à la question d'un journaliste au cours d'une conférence de presse au sommet du G7 en Italie. \"Je ne le gracierai pas\", a-t-il ajouté, précisant qu'il ne commuerait pas non plus la peine à laquelle il sera condamné. Le démocrate, qui affrontera le 5 novembre son prédécesseur et rival républicain Donald Trump, s'était déjà engagé à ne pas gracier son fils en cas de culpabilité, assurant \"respecter la procédure judiciaire\". Le président américain Joe Biden et son fils Hunter Biden (d) à son arrivée à la base aérienne de New Castle, le 11 juin 2024 dans le Delaware Reconnu coupable par un jury de mensonges et de détention illégale d'un revolver en 2018, Hunter Biden, 54 ans, encourt en théorie jusqu'à 25 ans de prison mais une peine alternative pourra être aussi décidée. Cet ancien avocat et homme d'affaires, reconverti en artiste-peintre, était jugé pour avoir menti sur sa consommation de drogues lors de l'achat d'un Colt Cobra dans une armurerie le 12 octobre 2018.",
