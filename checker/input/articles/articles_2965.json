    "text": "Bomet Church Under Fire for Assaulting Woman in Bid to ‘Cleanse Evil’: \"This Is Not Christianity\"\nNancy Odindo, a journalist at TUKO.co.ke, brings over four years of experience covering politics, news, and feature stories across digital and print media in Kenya.\nBomet - An elderly woman was burned at the Bethel of Jesus Ministry International in Kapkwen after being accused of practicing witchcraft.\nWhat happened inside Kapkwen church in Bomets?\nThe shocking incident, which took place within the church compound, has sparked public outrage, with calls for the arrest of the church leaders and the closure of the institution.\nAccording to witnesses, the woman was brought to the church with alleged magical items, including snakes, frogs, and traditional medicine.\nAccording to video footage shared by Citizen TV, during a prayer session, she reportedly collapsed as congregants attempted to rid her of her supposed demonic possessions. Church members then carried her outside and set a fire, claiming to be burning her alleged witchcraft items.\n“She came with her witchcraft items, such as snakes, frogs, and drugs. When she tried to remove those things, she fell. The pastor helped her, and we decided to take her outside and burn them. Anyone who brings such items, we burn them. We cannot allow them to take them back after being delivered,” a church member stated.\nThe woman reportedly screamed in different voices as she was carried over the fire, which worshippers interpreted as her demons being cast out.\nInside the church, several women were seen lying on the floor, engaged in intense prayer.\nThe incident has ignited public condemnation, with many Kenyans calling for immediate action against the church leadership. Some have demanded stricter regulations to curb criminal activities in religious institutions.\nThe case has also raised concerns about the rise of extreme religious practices and the exploitation of vulnerable individuals under the guise of deliverance prayers.\nHow did Kenyans react to Bomet church assault incident?\n@Just__Irene\n\"Can we get some regulation on these churches? They're getting out of hand.\"\n@bungomaduke\n\"They should be arrested. This is not what Christianity is all about! Sad.\"\n@princejob55\n\"We all need to visit Mathare National Teachers and Referral Hospital for some checkups. This is getting out of hand.\"\n@WanguWaMakeri22\n\"They should be arrested immediately! Such denominations deserve closure ASAP. 😭😭\"\n@owobuya\n\"This is criminal. Those involved should be arrested, and the church closed completely. ☹️\"\nMosesAmone\n\"Total madness. 😠😳 It's unfortunate that most of these so-called pastors or religious leaders can't be arrested or held responsible because they are, in most cases, conduits for corrupt politicians and governments.\"\n@Rosewn88\n\"This is a crime committed in the church. The law should take its course.\"\n@21withtafari\n\"Maybe it's high time we talk about the church and how manipulative those church leaders can be. Sasa hii ni nini?\"\n@JoeKimani383500\n\"Let the law take the course immediately. This isn't the faith I subscribed to. Very wrong!\"\n@2hikari22\n\"I can't imagine someone doing this to grandma. It's so disheartening to watch; hopefully, she was rescued.\"\nMore to follow...\nSource: TUKO.co.ke\nNancy Odindo (Current affairs editor) I have one year of experience in print media and more than four years in digital media.

    "text": "The temporary pier for Palestinian relief aid has returned to its beach site in Gaza once more, defying rumors that it might soon be canceled.\nBeginning in March, the U.S. military began deploying a complex cargo delivery system called Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS) to bring much-needed food aid into Gaza. This capability consists of a temporary pier, an offshore receiving station and a flotilla of landing craft. It has proven effective in previous deployments, like the response effort for the Haitian earthquake of 2010.\nThe Pentagon expected that the JLOTS system could handle up to 40 percent of Gaza's aid needs, but the operation has been beset by repeated problems - many related to its narrow operating window and its unsheltered location. Elements of the system are designed for service in Sea State 3 and below, and moderate swells are too rough for its capabilities.\nThe floating structure broke up in rougher weather in late May and had to be removed to the nearby port of Ashdod to be repaired. Last week, it was removed from the beach again in order to avoid more damage from wave action, and has now returned to service for the third time, according to Central Command.\nAt about 0900 hours Wednesday, U.S. military personnel reanchored the pier on the beach; CENTCOM emphasized that \"at no time during this event did U.S. troops enter Gaza.\" On Thursday, maritime deliveries resumed, and trucks began ferrying aid cargoes down the pier and onto shore. A record 650 tonnes of food and other goods were delivered during the day, the command said.\nTaken together with previous deliveries, the maritime corridor has transferred 4,160 tonnes of cargo to a marshaling area on the beach, where it will remain until further notice. Aid NGOs stopped distributing the food from the maritime corridor after a large-scale Israeli military operation on June 8, and the land-side half of the operation has been suspended pending a security review. The overall security situation in Gaza has deteriorated significantly over the past several weeks, and armed gangs have disrupted food distribution efforts within the territory.\nEven if the aid were delivered to recipients, the maritime transport volume falls short of target, amounting to an average of roughly 120 tonnes per day since the causeway entered service in mid-May. This amounts to eight typical truckloads per day, roughly five percent of the goal.\nMany aid NGOs and U.S. political leaders have called for aid resources to be redirected to cross-border trucking instead, leveraging commercial port infrastructure in Egypt and Israel.\n\"From a purely cost-based analysis, investing in a pier off the coast of Gaza is an inefficient use of our defense budget,\" argued Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) last week. \"The pier project has proven to be a logistical nightmare, with significant challenges and costs far outweighing any potential benefits.\"\nMace has sponsored a successful amendment to the annual defense spending bill that would ban any funding for a pier in Gaza next fiscal year. But given the challenges, the project could be suspended by the end of the month , according to rumors from Washington.\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder (USAF) pushed back on these reports in a press conference Thursday. \"While it's always been our intention for the pier to be a temporary solution as part of the broader international effort to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza to meet the urgent needs of the Palestinian people, we have not established an end date for this mission as of now,\" Ryder said.",

    "text": "The rivalry between [Eddie Hearn ](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/eddie-hearn/)and Simon Jordan is not new, and none of them are showing any signs of slowing down. The two have been out for each other throats because of their different opinions regarding boxing and integrity in sports. But the boiling point came in 2023 when the duo engaged in an hour-long debate on TalkSPORT talking about various things. Since then, the pair has been involved in constant back-and-forth online and Jordan has publicly criticized Hearn for his involvement with His Excellency Turki Alalshikh. But a new angle was added to this rivalry when Hearn claimed that the sports pundit “begged” for a meeting with His Excellency and Jordan hit back and called the Matchroom Promoter- a “Fool.” None of them are ready to let even one word slide, as Hearn hit back and brutally warned Jordan. Eddie Hearn promises Jordan another schooling lesson ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Hearn replied to Jordan without wasting any time and asked the latter to, “Pipe down or I will have to come in and school you again 😉,” hinting at another appearance on TalkSPORT. What’s your reaction? Eddie Hearn just told Simon Jordan to \"pipe down\"! React! Reactions Honestly this man’s a fool ! Never once asked for a meeting with anyone in Saudi . Ironically I was asked to meet them on Mon sept 16 and I couldn’t make it 🤷♂️ They then said next day , I tried to re arrange meetings they then said they can’t make it . [https://t.co/wCtNx6U8k8]— Simon Jordan (@Sjopinion10) [September 26, 2024] The last time Hearn appeared on TalkSPORT, where Jordan criticized the Matchroom Boxing promoter’s way of handling certain boxing events, fighters management, and promotional deals. Jordan even questioned the integrity and ethics of Hearn and how he conducts business. Known for his outspokenness, Hearn retorted back in a furious nature and [defended his way of doing business](https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-eddie-hearn-brands-he-turki-alalshikh-critics-almost-borderline-racist-boxing-insider-rallies-in-support/) while challenging Jordan’s lack of knowledge of the boxing world. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Many boxing fans agreed with Hearn and his way of doing business as it is expanding opportunities and attracting more eyes to the sport. In the fans’ eyes, Hearn was the clear winner of the argument, and according to the promoter, he won’t shy away from making another appearance at the talk show to teach Jordan some more. However, let’s get ready for some throwback. Jordan calls Hearn a ‘fool’ The latest chapter in this rivalry started when Jordan accused Hearn and [Frank Warren](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/frank-warren/) of “bullying” Boxxer chief Ben Shalom during the [Anthony Joshua](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/anthony-joshua/) vs. [Daniel Dubois](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/daniel-dubois/) undercard fight. During the undercard fight, Hearn and Shalom got into a heated exchange, opening a window for Jordan to attack. Hearn and Warren both hit back at Jordan and the Matchroom Boxing promoter called the latter a “rogue hero of controversy.” Hearn further clarified that Jordan asked for a meeting with HE Turki Alalshikh. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Jordan, who has been against the Saudi regime in boxing for a long time, denied the accusation as he came out with guns blazing. He not only called Hearn a “fool” but also stated that he “Never once asked for a meeting with anyone in Saudi.” He further clarified that he was asked to meet the royals on September 16, but he couldn’t make it and further attempts to arrange another meeting were unsuccessful. Hearn did not take this disrespect lightly and hit back at Jordan and savagely warned Jordan. What do you think about this ongoing beef between Eddie Hearn and Simon Jordan? Do you agree with Hearn’s way of conducting the business? Let us know your thoughts down below.",

In an unusual move, the Buffalo Bills have issued a statement, asking for people’s help in clearing the snow ahead of Sunday’s Wild Card Game. While they had pretty good compensation for offer, fans were looking to sweeten the pot. Advertisement The Buffalo Bills are inviting individuals aged 18 and older to help shovel snow inside the home turf. Shovelers can begin their work at 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night and continue till Sunday Morning if necessary. It’s not just voluntary work, as people registering for the job will get $20 per hour accompanied by complimentary food.

Bringing personal shovels is encouraged too if possible. Interested candidates can also pre-register by clicking [here](https://form.jotform.com/220033718778156). Moreover, one can also proceed to the Jani-King office trailer near the team’s store on Abbott Road for registration. The collaborative efforts aim to prepare the venue for the upcoming Bills’ Wildcard Playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Bills fans are enthusiastic about pitching in, and while they appreciate the $20 payment, they’re curious about an additional perk. Following the viral spread of the Bills’ statement online, fans eagerly inquired whether the shovelers would also get to attend the game for free.

Despite spending most of the season in the second spot in the AFC East, they secured the division title by beating the Miami Dolphins 21-14 in Week 18. Now, as the No. 2 seed in the AFC, the Bills are gearing up to face the No. 7 seed Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round of the playoffs. Buffalo Bills Fans Shoveled Through Snowstorms Bills fans lending a hand with shovels is not a new sight. In the previous season, during Week 11, the [Cleveland Browns](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/cleveland-browns/) were set to play against the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium. However, a snowstorm in Buffalo prompted the relocation of the game to Ford Field in Detroit. To ensure the Bills players reached the airport on time, dedicated Bills fans took it upon themselves to clear the driveways and roads, showcasing their support for the team.

Even in the toughest weather conditions, they stand by their team. Once again, the call is out for them to lend a hand, this time in clearing the snow from the stadium. There’s no doubt they’ll brave the cold to ensure a clear path for their team, eager to witness a victory in the Wildcard game. Advertisement Share this article",

But this is a blueprint.\\\"Opener Abdullah Shafique departed for four during a tricky session before lunch, caught by Usman Khawaja in the slips off Starc following a period of intense pressure.Imam-ul-Haq survived the initial blitz, but was no match for Cummins after the break, with the pacer sending down a probing ball that nipped back and trapped him lbw for 12.Masood was given out lbw by the umpire on 12, but it was overturned on review and he quickly got back in his stride.He took a nasty ball to the ribs that needed treatment, but was undeterred and raced to a gutsy 50 before Cummins again came to Australia's rescue, enticing an edge to Steve Smith.There was plenty resting on the shoulders of Azam as the side's premier batter and he looked in good nick.— MCG (@MCG) But after reaching 41, Josh Hazlewood got a ball to jag back and it clattered into his off stump.Mohammad Rizwan also looked dangerous on his way to 35 before Cummins again worked his magic, with Alex Carey collecting a catch behind the stumps after the ball went off the batsman's glove.Cummins then removed Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Shah Afridi in quick succession before Starc cleaned up.The Pakistanis padded up after the hosts were all out in their second innings for 262, after resuming on 187-6.Mir Hamza was the best of the bowlers with 4-32, while Afridi took 4-76.Carey slammed 53 to help Australia build their overnight lead.He resumed on 16 after Australia had bounced back from 16-4 thanks to an attacking 96 from Mitchell Marsh and Smith's gutsy 50.Carey, who made his first and only Test hundred in Melbourne a year ago, hit consecutive fours in his first over off Hasan Ali to build confidence.At the other end, Starc lived dangerously and fell for nine with the impressive Afridi getting the breakthrough on a pitch still offering a bit for the bowlers.Azam took the sharp chance at slip after Starc miscued a drive.Cummins made a breezy 16 but was caught behind by Rizwan off Jamal, who then bowled Lyon for 11, with Carey the last man out, lbw to Hamza.The final Test of the three-match series is in Sydney next week.",

He says the number is simply \"a statement of his age.\"\n\"I can't dance as fast as I used to, but I still can dance,\" says Neil with a laugh. \"The sense of humor is still with me, and I usually use it judiciously when things get a little tight in the council.\"\nWith nearly 67% of the votes in the third district race, Neil beat Jo Ann Mather to reclaim his seat.\n\"If you look to see what I've accomplished within a ten-year period, if that was satisfactory to them, why stop?\" asks Neil. \"I'm so glad that I'm elected with my constituents because we have the experience, and we already started to do things that we need to do.\"\nNeil says he will continue to prioritize Dover's affordable housing issue and find a way to limit skyrocketing rental costs.\n\"The gap between people who are low and fixed income is growing farther and farther in terms of what they can afford,\" Neil says. \"You can't build it fast enough in order to get ahead of the problem.\"\nNeil says this will likely be his final term.\n\"I'm going to be a public servant, and that's the idea behind it,\" Neil says. \"I find great satisfaction from that.",

    "title": "Une enquête sur un cardinal canadien est classée, et l'avocat de la plaignante dénonce le Vatican - Terrafemina",
    "text": "Le Vatican a annoncé mardi classer l'enquête sur l'influent cardinal canadien Gérald Cyprien Lacroix, soupçonné d'agression sexuelle sur une mineure dans son pays, en se fondant sur un rapport commandé par le pape François à un ancien juge québécois. \"Ce rapport ne permet pas d'identifier quelque geste d'inconduite ou d'abus de la part du cardinal\", a affirmé mardi le Vatican dans un communiqué. \"Une procédure canonique plus poussée n'est pas envisagée\" contre ce proche conseiller du pape François, conclut-il. Une décision qui n'a pas surpris l'avocat canadien de la plaignante. \"En rien cela n'est synonyme d'un système de justice indépendant\", a déclaré à l'AFP Me Alain Arsenault, qui dénonce une procédure \"viciée\". Âgé de 66 ans, Gérald Cyprien Lacroix est soupçonné d'\"attouchements\" sur une mineure dans le cadre d'une action collective visant plus d'une centaine de membres du diocèse de Québec. Cette action ouverte en 2022 regroupe les témoignages de 147 personnes. Selon le document judiciaire consulté par l'AFP, celui qui est archevêque de Québec depuis 2011 et cardinal depuis 2014 aurait procédé à des \"attouchements\" sur une mineure de 17 ans au moment des faits reprochés, entre 1987 et 1988. Face à cette affaire, le pape François avait demandé en février à l'ex-juge André Denis \"de conduire une enquête portant sur les faits, les circonstances et l'imputabilité du délit allégué\". Une première pour le Vatican qui n'avait jamais confié à un laïc une enquête visant un cardinal. Selon le Vatican, le juge Denis a conclu son enquête préliminaire le 6 mai et ses conclusions ont été communiquées \"les jours suivants\" au pape, qui a donc avalisé la décision d'abandonner la procédure canonique à l'encontre du cardinal Lacroix, l'un des neuf membres du C9, le conseil des neuf cardinaux qui l'assiste dans le gouvernement de l'Eglise et se réunit régulièrement au Vatican. \"Jamais, à ma connaissance, je n'ai posé de gestes inappropriés envers qui que ce soit, qu'il s'agisse de personnes mineures ou adultes\", s'était défendu fin janvier le prélat. \"Les éléments recueillis au cours de mon enquête rendent peu plausibles que les faits reprochés au cardinal se soient produits\", a conclu le juge Denis. \"La grande faiblesse de mon rapport est que je n'ai pas rencontré la demanderesse\", a-t-il toutefois reconnu lors d'une conférence de presse à Québec. Cette dernière a refusé de le rencontrer, réservant ses déclarations à la \"justice\", mais elle maintient \"évidemment toutes ces accusations\", a confié son avocat qui ajoute recevoir chaque semaine de nouveaux témoignages qui vient s'ajouter à l'action collective. Réitérant son innocence, le cardinal Lacroix va demeurer en retrait encore un certain temps \"pour favoriser un règlement de l'action collective\", a indiqué le diocèse de Québec dans un communiqué. Depuis l'élection du pape François en 2013, au moins trois autres cardinaux ont été mêlés à des accusations d'agressions sexuelles, dont Marc Ouellet, lui aussi canadien, qui occupait jusqu'en 2023 l'une des fonctions les plus importantes au sein de la Curie, l'administration centrale du Saint-Siège. Ce dernier a toujours nié \"fermement\" des accusations \"diffamatoires\". Fin 2022, le cardinal français Jean-Pierre Ricard, ancien archevêque de Bordeaux, avait reconnu avoir eu un comportement \"répréhensible\" avec une adolescente il y a 35 ans. L'enquête de la justice française pour \"agression sexuelle aggravée\" a été classée sans suite en raison de la prescription des faits, mais une enquête du Vatican se poursuit. En 2019, le pape François avait défroqué l'ancien archevêque de Washington, Theodore McCarrick, sanction quasi-inédite dans l'histoire de l'Eglise concernant un cardinal, après que le Vatican l'eut reconnu coupable d'avoir agressé sexuellement au moins un adolescent de 16 ans en 1974, et d'avoir eu un comportement sexuel déplacé auprès de séminaristes adultes. La lutte contre les violences sexuelles dans l'Eglise constitue l'un des chantiers du pontificat de François, qui défend une politique de \"tolérance zéro\" face à la multiplication des scandales tout en reconnaissant que l'Eglise doit \"faire plus\" contre ce fléau. Le pape argentin a créé une commission consultative pour la protection des mineurs, levé le secret pontifical sur les violences sexuelles du clergé et obligé religieux et laïcs à signaler tout cas à leur hiérarchie. Mais le secret de la confession demeure absolu et les associations de victimes réclament davantage de mesures. glr-tib/bpe © Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "In Holly Springs, North Carolina, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies North Carolina, Inc. will invest $1.2 billion to expand its biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility, creating 680 new jobs in Wake County. Initial investments of the FUJIFILM’s Holly Springs operation included $2 billion in 2021, making it the largest end-to-end biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in North America. “North Carolina is known worldwide as a biotechnology hub thanks to the continued investment from companies like FUJIFILM Diosynth,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the [Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina](http://www.edpnc.com). “Our robust infrastructure, top-notch engineering talent in the state, and partnerships with entities like NC State University and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center provide support for innovative companies like FUJIFILM to continue to grow.” In October 2023, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, North Carolina Department of Commerce Secretary Sanders, and Chung met in Japan with leaders from Japanese businesses in North Carolina, including FUJIFILM President and CEO Teiichi Goto, to discuss the continued partnership and the company’s facilities in the state. [FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies’](http://www.fujifilmdiosynth.com) expansion includes an additional large-scale monoclonal antibody Drug Substance manufacturing capacity that will support the company’s growing biologics CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) business. The project will also include two additional drug substance manufacturing buildings, a shared headblock building with administrative space, as well as expansions of utilities, lab, and warehouse buildings currently under construction. The average salary for new positions at FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies will be $109,923, which is notably higher than Wake County’s average wage of $74,866. Over the last 10 years (2014-2023), Japan has announced 9,220 jobs and $17.58 billion in investment in North Carolina. Currently, more than 30,500 North Carolinians work for Japanese companies such as HondaJet, Morinaga, and Sumitomo Forestry. In 2021, Toyota announced it would build its first North American battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, NC, investing $1.29 billion and creating 1,750 jobs. Since then, Toyota has announced three additional expansions [bringing the project’s total capital investment to $13.9 billion and 5,000 new jobs](https://businessfacilities.com/2023-deals-of-the-year/). More recently, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd., a lithium-ion battery pouch manufacturer, announced it will invest $233 million to build its first U.S. advanced manufacturing facility in Linwood, NC, creating 352 new jobs in Davidson County. The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina recognizes the North Carolina Department of Commerce as well as other key partners involved in the project, including the North Carolina General Assembly, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the North Carolina Community College System, Wake Technical Community College, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, North Carolina State University, the North Carolina Japan Center, Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, Capital Area Workforce Development, Wake County, the Town of Holly Springs, and Wake County Economic Development, a program of the Raleigh Chamber.

No tiene ninguna carrera profesional (aunque sea de cajera) ni profesión a la que volver, como sí tienen Pablo Iglesias o Monedero, que volvieron a sus respectivos trabajos y profesiones.\nHasta Ayuso se supone que trabajó de periodista en distintos sitios, no solo haciendo de perro de la Aguirre. Digo se supone porque me fío poco de la Ayusa sin verificar su currículum, pero se supone que es así.\nY con esto yo no invalidaba que la señora del pepé que anda llorando porque le han dado la patada haya trabajado en algo real (que ni lo sé ni me importa, no me extrañaría que se hubiera tocado el higo toda su vida), sino contestaba al comentario de\n[#46](c46#c-46) que habla de Mónica García, la cual tiene una carrera profesional como médico anestesista en el 12 de Octubre.\n[#105](c105#c-105) Entre 2011 y 2013 cursó y obtuvo el grado de máster en psicología de la educación.11 Posteriormente, gracias a su rendimiento académico, obtuvo una ayuda para contratos predoctorales de Formación de Profesorado Universitario (FPU) en la UAM entre 2013 y 2015, consiguiendo a raíz de esta una estancia formativa en la Universidad de Harvard, que rechazó por su compromiso político... https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Montero\nSobre muchos de los dirigentes de podemos y sobre el mismo Podemos se han lanzado tantos bulos y mentiras que en su vida se le quitara ya el San Benito de todos esos bulos. Pero no por ello hay que dejar de rebatirlo cuando se comenta.\n[#125](c125#c-125) Efectivamente, fue a la uni. Y efectivamente, no trabajó jamás (solo de cajera un año). Ni tiene carrera profesional a la que volver, porque nunca ha trabajado de nada (más allá de su breve periodo de cajera un año).\nAsí que sí, gracias por complementar con el enlace de su entrada en la Wiki para corroborar que no trabajó en su vida. Y por eso no puede volver a nada como sí pudieron volver a lo suyo el propio Pablo, Monedero, Luis Alegre o Bescansa, que tenían todos su profesión desde hacía muchos años.\n[#105](c105#c-105) Ayuso hace 20 años que dejó de hacer de periodista, se supone que en una radio en Irlanda y otra en Colombia, cobrar del chiringuito Madrid Networks no es trabajar.\n[#105](c105#c-105) Irene montero :\nDoctora en Derecho Constitucional por la Universidad de Valladolid, master en Derecho Internacional por el Instituto de Estudios Políticos para América Latina y África (Iepala) y licenciada en Derecho por la Universidad de Valladolid. Profesora Titular de Derecho Constitucional en la Universidad de Valladolid.\nYa quisieran muchos de nuestros politicastros tener una formación similar.\nMontero se ha dedicado siempre a la política. Lo de no darle un palo al agua y ser la mujer de quién es ya está bastante de más.\nPuede que no te gusten sus ideas políticas pero no veo yo masters falsos ni carreras sacadas en seis meses, ni mentiras varias, ni doctorados que no son, ni Harvard de tres días.\nVamos, que su carrera profesional está orientada a la política. Si eso no es una carrera profesional..... No se ni para que existe la carrera de ciencias políticas entonces.\n[#137](c137#c-137) JAJAJAJAJA ESE NO ES EL CURRICULUM DE MONTERO!!!!!!!!!\nES EL DE LA MINISTRA DE IGUALDAD ACTUAL, Ana Redondo García, DEL PSOE!!!\nIrene Montero ni es doctora ni es ná!!!!!!!!!! JAJAJAJAJA\n[#138](c138#c-138) mis disculpas. Trabajos predoctorales. Toma, de la razón:\nLa hoy ministra de Igualdad es licenciada en Psicología por la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, una carrera en la que, según cita el currículum “estudió con ayudas al estudio por aprovechamiento excelente” y por la que fue puntuada con una calificación de 9,09. Además, Irene Montero ha realizado un Máster en Psicología de la Educación por la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, donde obtuvo 9 matrículas de honor y la calificación de 9,5 en la tesis de máster.\nGoogle de inicio igual me ha traicionado.\nPaso de discutir con JAJAJAS\n[#139](c139#c-139) Vamos, que ni conocías su currículum ni te importaba\nEl JAJAJAJA es lógico ante ese sin sentido.\nY sí, su currículum real es el que pones y que yo ya conocía (por eso me descojoné al ver el que pusiste, que nada tenía que ver con el real... vaya tela): fue estudiante, solo eso. Y luego a tocarse los cojones en la política. No ha dado palo al agua en su vida, no ha trabajado en su vida. Es más inútil que Ayuso, lo siento.\nY lo que dices de Ciencias Políticas... eso es lo que estudiaron Pablo Iglesias, Monedero, Bescansa entre otros. Son politólogos. Y ellos SÍ tienen un lugar al que volver, porque tenían y tienen una carrera profesional detrás, que no implica ser chupabotes. Cosa que no tiene Montero. Irene Montero no tiene una profesión a la que volver, así que necesita que sus fangirls y sus seguidores le voten mucho para poder seguir viviendo del cuento toda su vida.\nEl 15M venía a acabar con liderazgos eternos y políticos profesionales, vividores del cuento y de la mamandurria. Todo lo contrario de lo que representa ahora mismo Irene Montero, pasando a ser Podemos un viejo club político old school más.\n[#103](c103#c-103) Me gusta ver a los 2 esos que van de izquierdas y quedan como cuñaos clasistas a la mínima. El pony dijo el otro día que Pablo Iglesias es un maltratador. Para que veas el nivel.\n[#97](c97#c-97) No, el equivalente a Monica Garcia (medico anestesista). Esta de UPN (que no del PP como dije erroneamente) fue medico de urgencias:\n\"Fue médica de urgencias del Hospital de Navarra y de algunos centros de atención primaria del Servicio Navarro de Salud, trabajando después en gestión de salud.\"\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Ibarrola\n[#110](c110#c-110) Ah coño\nAl ser del PP daba por hecho que te referías a que no había trabajado de nada en su vida (o lo daba por hecho yo).\n[#10](c10#c-10) suelen ir de la mano. Lo que entiendo es que tienen tantos votos porque hay mucho millonario wannabe.\n[#102](c102#c-102) Son como muchisimo \"regionalistas\". Hubo una escisión de \"nacionalistas navarros\" que era el CDN pero no duró muchoas legislaturas teniendo escaños\nEstos requetés, han tenido el ayuntamiento 4 años sin tener mayoría y se pensaban que ahora iba a ser igual, más en minoría. Encima, se permiten el lujo de pelearse con el PP, para sumar menos aún.\n[#65](c65#c-65) plantéatelo de la siguiente manera:\nNi loco sería presidente con el apoyo de bildu. Antes haría inserta tu trabajo aquí.\n[#108](c108#c-108) tu trabajo será cómodo, pero lo que debes tener en cuenta en esa frase es el tono despectivo con el que se habla de tu trabajo.\n[#17](c17#c-17) pocos de aquí se han dedicado a eso profesionalmente. No vayamos de lo que no somos. Si acaso nos ha tocado fregar el rellano nuestro y ya.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Todo depende del contexto y de quién lo dice. No es lo mismo que lo digamos tú o yo, que pueden venirnos mal dadas y efectivamente podemos acabar fregando escaleras o fregando platos en cualquier sitio para poder salir adelante, a que lo diga alguien bien acomodado desde las instituciones.\nEs una frase clasista cuando la espera alguien desde el poder. Es clasista e indignante.\n[#77](c77#c-77) Igual es que interesa pasar la frase por el filtro ideológico, porque según la experiencia de miles de millones, al igual que otros trabajos duros, mal pagados y poco reconocidos, fregar escaleras no le gusta ni al \"Tato\".\nMe temo que si en lugar de decir la frase \"prefiero fregar escaleras\" hubiera sido \"prefiero escarbar cebollinos\", seguro que muchos de los presentes sacarían punta a la frase, alegando una afrenta al colectivo de agricultores.",

    "title": "La capa de hielo global bate mínimos en el tercer febrero más cálido",
    "text": "MADRID, 6 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) - La extensión diaria del hielo marino global, que combina las extensiones de hielo marino en ambas regiones polares, alcanzó un nuevo mínimo histórico a principios de febrero y se mantuvo por debajo del récord anterior de febrero de 2023 durante el resto del mes, según el servicio de cambio climático Copernicus (C3S). El hielo marino del Ártico alcanzó su extensión mensual más baja en febrero, un 8 % por debajo de la media. Esto marca el tercer mes consecutivo en el que la extensión del hielo marino ha establecido un récord para el mes correspondiente. El hielo marino antártico alcanzó su cuarta extensión mensual más baja en febrero, un 26 % por debajo de la media. La extensión diaria del hielo marino puede haber alcanzado su mínimo anual cerca del final del mes. Si se confirma, sería el segundo mínimo más bajo en el registro satelital. Esta confirmación solo será posible a principios de marzo. Es importante señalar que el nuevo mínimo histórico para el Ártico en febrero no es un mínimo histórico. El hielo marino del Ártico se está acercando actualmente a su extensión máxima anual, que normalmente ocurre en marzo, advierte el informe. Febrero de 2025 fue el tercer febrero más cálido a nivel mundial, con una temperatura media del aire en superficie de 13,36 °C, 0,63 °C por encima de la media de febrero de 1991-2020, y solo marginalmente más cálida, en 0,03 °C, que el cuarto febrero más cálido de 2020. El mes pasado fue 1,59 °C superior a la media estimada de 1850-1900 utilizada para definir el nivel preindustrial y fue el decimonoveno mes de los últimos 20 meses* en el que la temperatura media global del aire en superficie fue más de 1,5 °C superior a la del nivel preindustrial. La temperatura media global del invierno boreal de 2025 (de diciembre de 2024 a febrero de 2025) fue la segunda más alta registrada, con 0,71 °C por encima de la media de 1991-2020 para esos tres meses, 0,05 °C más fría que el récord establecido para el invierno boreal de 2024. El período de 12 meses de marzo de 2024 a febrero de 2025 fue 0,71 °C superior a la media de 1991-2020 y 1,59 °C superior al nivel preindustrial. Según Samantha Burgess, directora estratégica para el clima del ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), dijo: \"Febrero de 2025 continúa la racha de temperaturas récord o casi récord observada durante los últimos dos años. Una de las consecuencias de un mundo más cálido es el derretimiento del hielo marino, y la cobertura de hielo marino récord o casi récord en ambos polos ha llevado la cobertura de hielo marino global a un mínimo histórico\". La temperatura media en tierra firme europea en febrero de 2025 fue de 0,44 °C, 0,40 °C por encima de la media de febrero de 1991-2020, lo que la sitúa muy por encima de los 10 meses más cálidos de febrero en Europa. Las temperaturas europeas fueron más altas que la media en el norte de Fennoscandia, Islandia y los Alpes. En Europa oriental se registró una gran región de anomalías negativas. Fuera de Europa, las temperaturas fueron más altas que la media en grandes partes del Ártico. También fueron superiores a la media en el norte de Chile y Argentina, el oeste de Australia y el suroeste de Estados Unidos y México. Las temperaturas fueron notablemente inferiores a la media en partes de Estados Unidos y Canadá. Otras regiones con temperaturas inferiores a la media incluyen las regiones adyacentes a los mares Negro, Caspio y Mediterráneo oriental, así como en una gran región del este de Asia, que abarca partes del sur de Rusia, Mongolia, China y Japón.",
