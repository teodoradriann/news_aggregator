    "title": "Court rules DC transit agency's ban on religious ads violates First Amendment",
    "text": "(RNS) — On Tuesday (May 21), a U.S. District Court ruled in favor of WallBuilders, a religious nonprofit banned from displaying its ads on Washington, D.C., buses, in its lawsuit challenging the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s advertisement policy. In its lawsuit filed in December , WallBuilders claimed the WMATA’s ad guidelines discriminated against certain opinions and violated the First Amendment. The agency rejected the WallBuilders campaign on the grounds that it violated its commercial advertising guidelines, which prohibit ads that “promote or oppose any religion, religious practice or belief” and “influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions.” Judge Beryl A. Howell called WMATA’s guidelines “vague” and said they didn’t provide “objective, workable standards” that could be reasonably applied as the First Amendment requires. Guideline 9, banning ads that intend to influence opinions on controversial issues, isn’t a “reasonable restriction on speech,” said Howell. “We are pleased that this ruling moves us one step closer to ending WMATA’s arbitrary censorship of speech about public issues,” said Arthur Spitzer, senior counsel at the ACLU District of Columbia, which represents WallBuilders along with the ACLU, First Liberty Institute and Steptoe law firm. RELATED: ACLU files suit against DC transit agency over refusal to display religious group’s ads Founded in 1989 by Texas conservative evangelical David Barton, WallBuilders promotes the idea that Christian faith played an important role in the creation of the Union and the drafting of the Constitution. The campaign rejected by the WMATA invited the public to learn more about the Founding Fathers’ attachment to Christianity. One ad featured Henry Brueckner’s painting of George Washington kneeling to pray at Valley Forge with the question: “Christian? To find out about the faith of our founders, go to wallbuilders.com.” For years, Barton has advocated for an end to the separation of church and state. His contested 2012 book, “The Jefferson Lies,” highlighted Jefferson’s alleged attachment to Christian values but was pulled from distribution after many historians flagged inaccuracies. RELATED: Warren Throckmorton takes on David Barton and ‘Christian nationalists’ revisionist history The plaintiffs denounced the WMATA’s decision to ban ads with religious content and argued the agency didn’t consistently enforce its policy, noting it had previously authorized ads that discussed controversial issues. “Rejecting a faith-based advertising banner by labeling it an ‘issue ad,’ while accepting other ads such as those promoting a ‘Social Justice School,’ ‘Earth Day,’ and the highly controversial idea of term limits for Supreme Court Justices, is clearly hypocritical, discriminatory and illegal,” said First Liberty senior counsel Jeremy Dys. The firms are now demanding that the court declare unconstitutional the WMATA’s guidelines on controversial ads and ads with religious content and that it order the agency to accept ads that violate those guidelines. Since 2015, the WMATA has been embroiled in numerous lawsuits over its advertisement guidelines. That year, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, also known as Stop Islamization of America, sought to display an ad representing the Prophet Muhammad bearing a sword and saying, “You can’t draw me!” The campaign was judged Islamophobic and blasphemous by many and prompted the agency to amend its policy to ban political, religious and advocacy ads. In 2017, the ACLU sued the agency for refusing to display ads for conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos’ new book, for Carafem’s abortion pills and for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ Go Vegan campaign. The ACLU also sued over the agency’s rejection of its own ads showing the text of the First Amendment written in English, Spanish and Arabic; the lawsuit is still pending. In 2017, the Archdiocese of Washington sued the agency for refusing to display its ads promoting Christmas celebrations and requesting donations to Catholic Charities. The court ruled in favor of the transit agency.",

    "title": "Meghan Jones makes history with Chicago Cubs: ‘It’s not lost on me the importance of having representation at this level’ – Twin Cities",
    "text": "Meghan Jones always loved sports and thought it would be fun to work in the industry.\nThat journey evolved over the last seven years. Jones didn’t exactly have a plan when the Chicago Cubs hired her in August 2016 as the executive assistant to then-president of baseball operations Theo Epstein and then-general manager Jed Hoyer.\n“I never knew that it was necessarily possible or how to get there,” Jones told the Tribune, “and so when I found my foot in the door to the EA position, I just told myself, ‘Title aside, let me see what the Cubs need to do and how I can help make an impact.’\n“That being said, I knew that the EA title and EA role didn’t have a very traditional trajectory out, and so I’ve been intentional to job-craft and ebb and flow with what the Cubs needed and it has taken me to where I am today.”\nLast month the Cubs promoted Jones, 32, to vice president of baseball strategy, making her the first woman to hold a VP title in baseball operations in franchise history.\n“It’s not lost on me the importance of having representation at this level,” Jones said. “It’s obviously a testament to my work, but it’s also an opportunity to have a platform in a different way for women in sports.\n“One thing that I’ve had to continue to try to be comfortable with is that whatever I do here in sports or anywhere, I am a woman, so inherently I’m going to be a female leader and that’s just part of my identity.”\nJones’ drive quickly stood out to Hoyer. Not long after joining the organization, she approached Hoyer and Epstein about taking night classes at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management to earn her Master of Business Administration.\nAfter her EA role, Jones took over as assistant director of baseball operations administration and strategic initiatives, and then in February she was named director of baseball operations administration and strategy.\n“She’s always learning, always trying to push herself, works unbelievably hard, and she also does a really good job of figuring out how to create value,” Hoyer told the Tribune last week.\n“She knows different areas where she might realize that this is a project no one is taking the reins on, and she’ll just grab it and see it to conclusion. She’s one of those people that when you give her a project, she’s always going to do better than you expect, which is an awesome feeling. And she’s done that time after time — it’s really a remarkable skill set.”\nJones’ responsibilities can be all over the map, sometimes literally.\nShe went to Japan in September as part of Hoyer’s trip to watch Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitch in Nippon Professional Baseball ahead of his posting and subsequent courtship by big-league teams, a process that remains ongoing.\nJones has helped with the Cubs family program, been involved in player recruitment and become very involved with the NWSL’s Chicago Red Stars , now led by Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts’ ownership group.\nShe also played an influential role in co-founding the Cubs’ CASE Study Program, which targets communities of color to provide an opportunity for select high school students to be immersed with the Cubs front office during a six-week program. The San Francisco Giants and Detroit Tigers launched their versions after seeing how the Cubs utilized their program.\n“I couldn’t tell you which thing will be next on her plate,” Hoyer said, “but it’ll be something that’s really important and we’ll realize she’s the right person to grab that project and take it forward.”\nMore broadly, Jones oversees the Cubs baseball strategy as it relates to people, process and culture.\n“For me, it’s very clear that my purpose is to put others in a position to move forward faster and that is what drives me,” she said. “I feel like I’m in a position to do that here at the Cubs. Whether it’s our entry-level employees or Jed and Carter (Hawkins), my job puts me in a position to help others do their jobs and make an impact more quickly.”\nAmong the Cubs’ other internal promotions last month, Jared Banner was named an assistant general manager , making him one of a few African Americans to presently hold an assistant GM title or higher with an MLB team. Houston Astros GM Dana Brown is the only African American currently leading a baseball operations department.\n“Representation matters,” Banner told the Tribune, “and if I can be someone that gives hope to maybe an entry-level employee or someone who’s not in baseball yet, in terms of what they may be able to accomplish, then I think that’s pretty special so I take pride in that.\n“Even though it’s not something I think about constantly, I recognize that there aren’t a lot of people who sat in the seat that I now occupy and it’s important to recognize that. This organization as a whole, being inclusive is an important value of ours and we’ve made a commitment to it and we’re willing to put in the work to get there. Are we there yet? Not quite, but the mission never ends.”\nBanner joined the organization before the 2021 season as VP of special projects when Hoyer hired him after changes in the New York Mets front office. Banner joins Ehsan Bokhari as the Cubs’ two assistant GMs following Craig Breslow’s departure to lead the Boston Red Sox baseball operations.\nHoyer called it a logical decision to promote Banner, 37, and continue to give him more responsibilities after watching the Cubs minor leagues flourish the last two years under Banner’s direction. The Cubs ended the 2023 season with one of the top farm systems in baseball. Interviews were underway last week to find a new farm director.\n“Knowing how talented he was, he’s come in here and done nothing but prove that,” Hoyer said.\nDiversity within Major League Baseball remains an ongoing issue both on the field and in front offices. The league’s implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs has tried to address the problem at the root, most notably through its DEI fellowship program.\nGains are still needed, however. This year’s annual racial and gender report card by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at the University of Central Florida gave MLB an overall grade of C+.\nAt the beginning of the 2023 season, four people of color (13.3%) held the position of either general manager, president of baseball operations or the equivalent for a team, resulting in a D+ grade from TIDES. Among all team vice president positions, women held 19% of the jobs, an increase of 1.4% from 2022, according to the report.\nAfter Hoyer named Hawkins as the Cubs’ new GM in October 2021, he faced questions about whether it was a missed opportunity to help diversify the top level of the Cubs front office. Hoyer knows from his position he can help improve diversity within the organization from top to bottom, which has included naming assistant GMs Bokhari, a quantitative psychology Ph.D. hired from the Astros to the position in 2021 , and Banner.\n“It’s really important that we grow the game and it’s really important that we bring people together from different backgrounds,” Hoyer said last week. “It provides different perspectives. Front offices should look a lot like the crowd at a baseball field.”\nFor Hoyer and the Cubs, those efforts begin with internships and entry-level hires in which talented people can move up through the organization. Addressing diversity on a multitude of levels — including race, gender, socioeconomic and disability status — remains a work in progress in baseball.\n“Hiring a very diverse group of people that can start out there because, in the end, those people are your future,” Hoyer said. “The people you hire at the entry-level positions are the people you are going to want to be your leaders at some point.”\n()\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) More Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Submit to Stumbleupon (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Three children now dead from early morning St. Paul house fire Three children now dead from early morning St. Paul house fire Soucheray: Why do we think we should spend a billion-plus for a West Seventh streetcar?

    "text": "(The Center Square) — Iowans will keep more of their money in their pockets in 2024. The state's top marginal income tax rate will roll back Jan. 1, 2024, from 6% to 5.7%. Gov. Kim Reynolds said in September more are likely when lawmakers convene in January. The state ended fiscal year 2023 with a $1.83 billion surplus. \"Some see a surplus as government not spending enough, but I view it as an over collection from the hard-working men and women of Iowa,\" [Reynolds said](https://www.thecentersquare.com/iowa/article_681f83c2-5d71-11ee-a33f-c76f9bdbfb22.html). \"We've seen what the powerful combination of growth-oriented policies and fiscal restraint can create, and now it's time for Iowans to directly receive the benefits. I look forward to cutting taxes again next legislative session and returning this surplus back to where it belongs — the people of Iowa.\" The income tax cuts signed by Reynolds in 2022 are a step toward a 3.9% flat income tax rate by 2026. The corporate tax rates will drop from 8.4% to 7.1% for businesses with more than $100,000 in income. Companies with less than $100,000 in revenue will pay 5.5%. Lawmakers also slashed the inheritance tax from 4% to 2% and the franchise tax from 4.7% to 4.4% beginning in 2024. These are the second round of tax cuts enacted by Reynolds in the legislature. Last year's cuts returned $561 million to the taxpayers but did not hurt the state's financial position, the [Revenue Estimating Conference](https://www.thecentersquare.com/iowa/article_e3f8d7fe-99ea-11ee-a894-5319628225af.html) said earlier this month. No adjustments are needed to the fiscal year 2024 budget, according to Committee Chair Kraig Paulsen. The general fund revenue for Iowa is projected at $9.6 billion for fiscal year 2025, according to the committee. Iowa lawmakers return to Des Moines for the 2024 legislative session on Jan. 8. Reynolds will address the Legislature on Jan. 9.",

    "text": "A new federal petition has been launched, and calls for a $1,000 refundable tax credit for people with celiac disease, like Betsy Hiebert.\nToday, Hiebert owns a certified gluten-free bakery in Winnipeg called Cocoabeans Gluten-Free , but over a decade ago — when she was first diagnosed with celiac disease — she was at a loss.\n“It’s really scary because you feel like all your food options have been taken away, like everything that you used to be able to eat safely or you saw it safely is what was actually making you sick,” she said.\nThe disruption to her social life ate at her.\n“You feel kind of left out. I don’t even want to go out and eat. I don’t even want to be out with my friends or my family because it just feels not inclusive, right? You can’t participate fully like you would have, and I think that’s the part that it kind of alienates you,” she said.\nStory continues below advertisement Then there was — and is — the astronomical cost.\nAccording to data from Celiac Canada, the price of gluten-free food is 150- to 500-per cent higher than their gluten-containing counterparts.\n“My husband can eat gluten, he’s the only one in the family and he buys his sort of rustic loaf of bread for $6.99. Well, my bread, you know, is $11,” Hiebert said as one example, adding the cost of truly gluten-free ingredients are also an expense for her bakery.\nMore on Health More videos Federal lab confirms B.C. teen is first to contract bird flu in Canada As bird flu emerges in Canada, experts urge preparedness Will your medication be impacted by port strike ripples?

For us it’s $100. So, we’re paying a premium for that designated celiac safe, gluten-free oat,” she said. “We’re still paying, you know, thousands of dollars above and beyond what a wheat-based bakery would pay.”\nThe expenses are generated by the rarity of gluten-free certifiable products.\nGet weekly health news Receive the latest medical news and health information delivered to you every Sunday.

But guess what? They come in contact with wheat, rye or barley. Whether it’s at the field level, the farm level — like with harvesting — or even at the terminal. When you bring your oats to market, if they’re not dealt in a gluten-free terminal, they’re going to get cross-contaminated, which means they are no longer safe,” Hiebert said.\nShe’s hopeful as celiac-friendly diets grow more common, and manufacturing practices align, prices will come down for this medical necessity.\nStory continues below advertisement “Because our food has to be gluten-free, a lot of it has to be certified… what can fill the head of a pin can make us sick,” said Christa Dubesky, president of the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) Manitoba Chapter.\nWhile it certainly is, figuratively, a headache, the symptoms can be much more than that.\n“When we do consume, it’s more than just a stomachache. There are 300 documented symptoms of celiac disease, so it’s really a broad spectrum of things that happen,” Dubesky said. “It’s a little bit of a challenge because people don’t think it’s serious.”\n“It’s more than a fad.”\nWhile people with celiac disease can claim a Medical Exemption Tax Credit , it’s a complicated and burdensome process , which for many isn’t worth the effort.\n“When I was first diagnosed, I collected every receipt for a two-year period and had to go figure out the difference in costs between a regular gluten containing product, and a gluten-free,” said Melanie Bauer, a CCA Manitoba Chapter member.\n“The first year, I spent over $2,000 on just trying to buy gluten-free flour and bread and grains. The only time it makes a difference is if it’s more than three per cent of your household income. So, if your household income is $50,000, you have to spend over $1,500 for them to even take into consideration on your income tax.\nTrending Now ‘Full House’ star Dave Coulier reveals ‘very aggressive’ cancer diagnosis Kate Middleton fans slam TV star for ‘vile’ comment about princess’s looks Story continues below advertisement “After two years of saving all the receipts and envelopes and highlighting everything, my accountant basically told me it wasn’t worth it for me to continue doing it.”\nCeliac Canada says only one in five people actually use the program, but many need the extra help.\nBauer said the number of people requesting celiac-friendly hampers from Harvest Manitoba has more than doubled in the past three years.\n“When we first started packing, we were doing 50 to 75 (hampers) every couple of months. And now, like I said, we’re up to like the 200 mark,” she said, adding more will be packed for Christmas, and are expected to be completely cleaned out.\nDubesky said, because of the expense, some eat gluten despite its impact to their health, especially if more than one person in their family has celiac disease.\n“They’re trying to feed their children gluten-free… because they can only afford it for them. That is just a really horrifying and sad situation , ” she said.\nIt’s a reason why the new federal petition was launched on Oct. 11.\nAs of Thursday, over 24,000 Canadians signed in support. Hiebert is one of them, and said it could be a game changer — giving everyone who needs it the opportunity to live well.\nStory continues below advertisement “I’m celiac and I have to adhere to a special diet. If I don’t, I become sick. And guess what? I’m going to be an extra burden on health care,” she said.\n“Think of all the doctor visits that you can save by eating gluten-free and sticking to that gluten-free diet. Not only will your belly feel better, but your whole body will feel better because it’s just getting the nutrients that you need.\n“Having safe food — that is the prescription for gluten-free or for being celiac.”\n2:09 Celiac Canada urging Ottawa for better tax relief as gluten-free grocery costs soar",
