    "text": " Ferrall Thinks Sean Payton is a ‘Phony’ Amid Russell Wilson Situation by SportsGrid\n3 Hours Ago\nIn the high-stakes world of NFL football, accountability and performance are always under the microscope. Recently, Sean Payton , head coach of the Denver Broncos, found himself at the center of a media whirlwind, addressing the mounting criticism directed at quarterback Russell Wilson, the decision to bench him for the season, and what looks like will end in him being cut.\nPayton himself expressed his constraints, “I can’t replace the entire offensive line. I can’t bring in five new receivers, and if it continues over a period of time, then there’ll be another guy here talking to you as well.”\nThis candid admission from Payton reflects the complex dynamics of an NFL team. The spotlight often falls on quarterbacks, but the success of a football team hinges on multiple factors, including coaching strategies, player performances, and team chemistry.\nSportsGrid’s Scott Ferrall didn’t mince words in his analysis of the situation.\nFerrall, known for his straight-shooting style, didn’t hold back in his critique. “I was on this guy for turning it around for the Broncos. They had it all turned around, then cabled in their pants again. They went from bad to good and right back to bad again. And I said he did a great job in Denver. I take all that back. He’s not done a great job at all in Denver.”\nThe sharp commentary from Ferrall underscores the volatile nature of NFL coaching and quarterback performance. “He’s right about one thing. If he keeps it up, they’ll replace him too. If they’re willing to give this guy (Wilson) $90 million to go away, they’re willing to give him (Payton) $90 million to go away too. They’re not afraid to pay anybody out. He’s got rid of his quarterback, and they’ll get rid of his ass too.”\nMoreover, Ferrall took a dig at Payton’s relationship with the media. “He doesn’t like the media now. He’s such a phony, this guy. He’s a phony. He was in the media, sucking the microphone and everybody’s favorite friend on TV. Now he’s a coach again and hates the media and anyone who asks him a question he’s offended by. I’m sick and tired of his act.”\nWatch Ferrall’s Full Rant\nFerrall’s comments highlight the often tumultuous relationship between the media, coaches, and players in professional sports. As the season progresses, all eyes will be waiting to see what happens with Wilson and how they navigate these challenges. “Keep it up, Sean. You’re the most overpaid coach in the NFL. Keep it up, buddy. You’re the man,” Ferrall concluded with a tone of sarcasm, pointing to the high expectations and scrutiny of leading an NFL team.\n Dail.",

Clouds and showers are rolling across the Carolinas this Friday evening, and it’s only going to get nastier from here. Expect widespread rain, heavy at times, overnight, totalling anywhere between 1-2″. The majority of the moisture will lift to the northeast shortly before noon on Saturday, but a few showers may linger into the afternoon. Most communities will be completely clear of clouds and rain by sunset. Highs will struggle to get out of the 40s and 50s through the early afternoon, but if clearing arrives earlier, the Metro and southward may quickly warm into the 60s. Much colder air filters in behind this rainmaking system, leaving many with frost and freeze as we wake up on Sunday. Abundant sunshine will allow temperatures to quickly recover into the lower 60s across the Piedmont and Foothills, but gusty winds from the northwest will make it difficult to get any warmer. Continued allow highs to run into the mid-60s on Monday before clouds return to the forecast by Tuesday afternoon. Medium-range models are trending towards a wet midweek. Tonight: Rain, heavy at times. Low: 57°. Wind: E 5-15. Gusts: 20+ Saturday: Scattered showers, especially before noon. PM clearing. High: 62°. Wind: N 10-20. Gusts: 25+ Saturday Night: Mostly clear and cold. Frost likely. Low: 36°. Wind: N 10-20. Gusts: 25+ Sunday: Sunny and breezy. High: 62°. Wind: NW 10-20. Gusts: NE 10-20. Gusts: 25+",

    "text": "THE Rustenburg Regional Court sentenced pastor Zoliswa Menziwa (36) to two years imprisonment on Thursday, 11 December, for contravention of section 22 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007). Menziwa was arrested at a house used as a church in Sondela Phase 1, Rustenburg, on 1 June 2022 following a tip-off. Daily Sun published the story on 7 June 2022 headlined: [PASTOR told us to strip naked](https://www.snl24.com/dailysun/news/pastor-told-us-to-strip-naked-20220607) and again on 13 June 2022, under headline: [Naked church members get bail](https://www.snl24.com/dailysun/news/naked-church-members-get-bail-20220613). The church members were all naked at the time of the arrest, except for the 36-year-old church leader. The congregants said the pastor instructed them to remove their clothes as she had a vision that Jesus was coming back. She was found with five congregants who were naked together with eleven children. The convict was the only individual who was found clothed at the time, and she was allegedly the church leader.

They were taken to social workers for intervention and ultimately placed under the care of other family members. One of the residents said they were happy that justice was served, adding that she feared being attacked for speaking up. “I'm one of the people who called the police.\" She said they would have never allowed the pastor back into the community. Nomonde Mcingani, a friend of the convicted pastor, said she was unhappy about the conviction. “I believe she was influenced by evil spirits. She needs help not imprisonment. “I want her to receive the help she needs because a normal person wouldn’t act the way she did,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Sam Tselanyane said the case was allocated to the Rustenburg family violence, child protection and sexual offences (FCS) unit for further investigation. He said thorough investigations were conducted by unit commander Colonel Mosidi Mafora and Warrant Officer Phiri Mfetane. Tselanyane said the accused was found guilty as charged, while the other five accused were acquitted. Menziwa was sentenced to two years imprisonment wholly suspended for five years on the condition that she is not convicted of the same charge during the period of suspension. North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena welcomed the sentence. Sello said that the police remain committed to fighting crimes against women and children. He said defending the vulnerable will always remain a priority for the police in the province. Sello also praised the investigating team for the sterling job of ensuring that perpetrators of this kind of crime face the full might of the law.",

    "text": "Bengaluru: In a setback to the Congress government in Karnataka, the controversial Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which is aimed at collecting 10 per cent of the total income from the rich temples, failed to pass in the Legislative Council on Friday. As members of the BJP and the JD(S) raised objections, Deputy Chairman of the Council, M.K. Pranesh, called for a voice vote, in which the Bill was rejected after the opposition members voted against it. Seven members voted for the Bill, while 18 members voted against it. Proposing the Bill in the Council, Transport and Muzrai Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that as per the present rules, the government is getting Rs 8 crore from the temples. After the new rule is passed, the government will earn Rs 60 crore and from these funds, the ‘C’ grade temples would be managed, Reddy said. Stating that there are more than 40,000 priests at the 34,165 ‘C’ grade temples across the state, the minister said, “We will provide funds to the priests to build homes and provide scholarships to their children. We also provide insurance cover to them.” Opposing the Bill, the leader of opposition in the Council, Kota Srinivas Poojari, said that it is not tenable to collect 10 per cent from the income of temples. “If Rs 100 crore is collected, Rs 10 crore has to be given to the government as per the Bill. But, one must first deduct the expenditures and then the government can take its share. The government should grant Rs 200 crore for the development of ‘C’ grade temples in the state,” Poojari said. BJP MLC N. Ravikumar said the state government should not even think of collecting 10 per cent income from the temples. “Rs 60 crore is not a big amount for the state government. Hindu temples must be allotted with Rs 300 crore for development work,” he said. After this, Minister Reddy said that he will present the Bill on Monday, which was objected to by Deputy Chairman Pranesh, who called for a voice vote for the Bill to pass. After the Bill was rejected, the BJP members raised ‘Jai Sri Ram’ slogans inside the House, while their Congress counterparts chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Jai Bheem’. On Wednesday, the controversial Bill was passed by the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. Meanwhile, taking to social media, the BJP claimed that as per the Bill, persons belonging to other religions can become part of the temple management process. “This is a malicious intent of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to dry the coffers of the temples with the help of people from other religions, much the same way he has emptied the state’s treasury,” the BJP alleged.",

    "text": "The USDA’s India Post has raised the forecast for the country’s centrifugal sugar production for marketing year 2024-25, starting October, to 35.5 million tonnes on higher recovery aided by adequate monsoon in key producing States. The projections by the local office are higher than USDA’s estimates of 34.5 million tonnes. The production estimate for 2023-24 has been unchanged at 34 million tonnes.\nThe estimates of 35.5 million tonnes on raw value basis are equivalent to 33.2 million of crystal sugar, including khandsari. The Indian Sugar Mills and Bio Energy Manufacturers Association has forecast sugar production, before diversion, at 33.31 million tonnes.\nUSDA India Post’s forecast of higher production is supported by expectations of a good crop due to sufficient rainfall during the 2024 southwest monsoon, and a better than expected sugar recovery rate. The monsoon rainfall is likely to replenish the soil moisture and increase the availability of ground water for irrigation in Maharashtra and Karnataka, the major sugarcane producing States. Uttar Pradesh, the largest producer of sugarcane, also received sufficient rainfall.\nAcreage cut a tad However, the USDA Post has marginally reduced India’s planted area for sugar for the 2024-25 by 1 percent, at 5.4 million hectares. This is a result of farmers’ shift to areca (betel) nut, cotton, paddy (rice), and pulses in Northern Karnataka and some parts of Maharashtra, it observed.\nSugarcane farmers have shifted to other competing crops based on expectations of drought conditions that were experienced in the previous year. Lowering groundwater level is a concern for sugarcane growers. However, Post ascertained that sugarcane production will increase by 1 percent to 418 million tonnes, compared to previous year’s 415.5 million tonnes. The substantial rainfall received in 2024 is likely to increase the sugar recovery rate of the standing crops and mitigate the effect of decreased cane area.\nFor the year 2024-25, the sugar exports are expected to remain unchanged at 3.7 million tonnes as the Centre continues to maintain export restrictions, the Post said. Sugar consumption for the forecast year is projected to remain steady at 32 million tonnes driven by demand during festival seasons and organised and unorganised catering services.\nAlso the USDA Post has increased the forecast for India’s 2024-25 ending stock to 13.6 million tonnes due to a good production year and continued export restrictions.",

    "text": "Migliaia di manifestanti si sono radunati in piazza a Cagliari per il corteo regionale, in occasione dello sciopero generale proclamato da Cgil e Uil contro la manovra del governo che non piace ai due sindacati che sollecitano modifiche sostanziali di per aumentare salari e pensioni, finanziare sanità, istruzione e servizi pubblici e investire nelle politiche industriali. Lo stop di 8 ore riguarda tutti i settori privati e pubblici, ad eccezione dei trasporti dove è di 4 ore a fronte della precettazione imposta dal ministro Salvini (esclusi dallo stop i servizi ferroviari)..\n E i primissimi dati dello sciopero generale in Sardegna di tutto il comparto del trasporto pubblico locale, diffusi dal segretario regionale della Filt Arnaldo Boeddu, si attesta sul 70% di media. Alle 10 è iniziato anche lo sciopero relativo al comparto aereo con le prime cancellazioni dei voli in arrivo e in partenza dagli scali isolani. Analoga situazione nel trasporto marittimo con le isole minori La Maddalena e Carloforte dove l'adesione si sta attestando con una percentuale con picchi del 70%.\n In piazza a Cagliari anche il segretario generale della Uil pensionati Carmelo Barbagallo che critica la ritrovata \"austerità che anche l'Europa sta portando avanti. Così come non eravamo d'accordo prima sull'austerità, non siamo d'accordo adesso - osserva parlando della manovra del governo - nel nostro Paese i lavoratori e i pensionati hanno perso il potere d'acquisto e non lo recupereranno con queste manovre che sono riduttive .Bisogna fare in modo che il governo cambia idea. Noi abbiamo gente che non riesce più a curarsi, abbiamo strutture che non riescono più a portare avanti le iniziative che sono necessarie per lo sviluppo del Paese.\n \"Questa manovra non ci piace perché non dà risposte concrete alle esigenze reali del Paese - osserva Fausto Durante, segretario regionale Cgil sarda - L'Italia non è il Paese delle meraviglie che il governo dipinge. I salari sono bassi, le pensioni, soprattutto in Sardegna, sono più basse che nel resto del paese. Abbiamo un aumento della classe integrazione e un peggioramento di tutti i principali dati macroeconomici\".",

    "title": "Year in Review: Top Deals in 2023",
    "text": "According to PWC, “2023 was a reasonably strong year for the pharmaceutical and life sciences sector with both deal value and volume of M&A close to pre-pandemic levels.” Below is a recap of the top M&A deals in 2023 that focus on biologics and biosimilars and were covered on the Big Molecule Watch. In March, Coya Therapeutics, Inc. (“Coya”), a biopharmaceutical company based in Houston, announced a worldwide agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (“Dr. Reddy’s”) to license Dr. Reddy’s proposed biosimilar abatacept for the development and commercialization of COYA 302 for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Under the agreement, Coya in-licensed Dr. Reddy’s proposed abatacept biosimilar and obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize COYA 302 across multiple neurodegenerative diseases in multiple territories, including in North and South America, the EU, United Kingdom, and Japan. Dr. Reddy’s will have exclusive rights to the same in areas outside of these territories. Coya later reported its 48-week clinical data for a proof-of-concept open-label study in 4 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) demonstrating that treatment with COYA 302 appeared to ameliorate disease progression. In October, Coya reported new data supporting the mechanism of action of COYA 302 for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”) at the 22nd Annual Northeast ALS Consortium Meeting. In September, Meitheal, a biopharmaceutical company based in Chicago, entered into an exclusive licensing deal with Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“THDB”) to market three biosimilars of the top selling branded insulins in the United States – asprat, lispro and glargine. All are expected to begin clinical trials in 2024. The agreement granted Meitheal and its parent company, Nanjing King-Friend Biochemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“NKF”), exclusive rights to commercialize the three biosimilar insulin products upon approval by the FDA, estimated to be on or around 2026. THDB and NKF will jointly handle product development and supply. In January, Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus”) announced the execution of a binding term sheet with Klinge Biopharma GmbH (“Klinge Biopharma”) for the exclusive commercialization rights to FYB203, Formycon AG’s (“Formycon”) biosimilar candidate to EYLEA (aflibercept), in the United States. Under the binding term sheet, Coherus will make a total upfront payment to Klinge of approximately €30 million, comprised of cash and Coherus common stock, thirty days after the execution of the definitive agreements. Coherus will also make other regulatory and launch milestone payments and share profits approximately equally with Klinge in consideration for the commercialization rights to FYB203 in the United States. Formycon AG is entitled to participate in all Klinge income under the agreement with Coherus in the mid-single to low-double-digit-percentage range. Coherus intends to launch the product at EYLEA biosimilar market formation, currently expected to be in 2025, if approved. In January, Alteogen, Inc. (“Alteogen”) announced that it entered an exclusive license agreement with Sandoz AG (“Sandoz”) pursuant to which Sandoz will have worldwide rights to use Alteogen’s ALT-B4 hyaluronidase, derived using HYBROZYME Technology, to develop and commercialize a subcutaneous version of a Sandoz biosimilar product. Sandoz also has an option to license the HYBROZYME Technology for two other products. Under the agreement, Alteogen received an upfront payment and is eligible to receive milestone payments upon Sandoz’ achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones. Alteogen will be entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit to low-double digit on sales of the commercialized product. Alteogen will be responsible for regulatory development and commercial supply of ALT-B4 to Sandoz. For the two option products under this agreement, Alteogen and Sandoz will negotiate separate agreements at the time of exercising each option. The agreement allows for both companies to collaborate on the development and commercialization of additional products that Sandoz may undertake to develop. In June, Coherus announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Surface Oncology, Inc. (“Surface Oncology”), where, at the closing, Coherus will acquire Surface Oncology, a clinical-stage immuno-oncology (“I-O”) company developing next-generation immunotherapies that target the tumor microenvironment. Coherus noted that this acquisition adds two differentiated clinical stage assets to Coherus’ novel I-O pipeline: SRF388, a novel IL-27-targeted antibody currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in lung cancer and liver cancer, and SFR114, a CCR8-targeted antibody currently in a Phase 1/2 study as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. There was reported a stock for stock transaction valued at up to $65 million and an approximate three-fold premium over Surface’s anticipated net cash of $20 to $25 million at closing. Surface shareholders will also receive CVRs based on potential future payments for previously partnered assets and for potential ex-US licensing.

    "text": "Bhubaneswar: IMD forecast on Thursday said dense fog would be very likely to continue in several districts during the next two to three days amid a slight rise trend in minimum temperature. The districts likely to witness this include Puri, Khurda, Nayagarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, among others. The office of Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) in the wake of IMD's warning sent its routine advisory to district collectors to take needful steps for restricted driving in their respective areas during morning hours. \\\"Police and transport officials of respective districts may take necessary steps for controlled plying of vehicles on highways during dense fog to avoid any road accident,\\\" reads the advisory from SRC office. H R Biswas, the regional head of IMD centre in the city said, “Prevailing wind pattern and availability of moisture favour for continue of shallow to moderate or dense fog in the state this week.” He said minimum temperature saw a rise by two to three degrees Celsius at several places in the state and there would be no large change in the prevailing trend of mercury level during the next three-four days. Dense fog reducing visibility to 50 meter or less was reported from towns like Rourkela, Cuttack, Phulbani, Nayagarh and Koraput.We also published the following articles recentlyIMD issues red warning for very dense fog todayThe weather department has issued a red alert for very dense fog in Delhi-NCR on Friday. Experts warn against venturing out in vehicles between 4 am and 10 am due to the high risk of car pile-ups and accidents. Overnight winds on Thursday improved visibility, but Friday is expected to have very low visibility due to decreased wind speed. The air quality in Delhi remains very poor, and the AQI is likely to stay in the very poor range until Sunday. Noida and Ghaziabad also experience improved but still very poor air quality.106362105Brace for dense to very dense fog in Lucknow todayLucknow experiences first 'cold day' of winter as maximum temperature drops, breaking warm spell. Thick fog persists, reducing visibility and obstructing sun rays. Temperature remains below normal, with a weak western disturbance changing wind pattern and causing moisture incursion. Fresh western disturbance expected to bring snow in Jammu & Kashmir and increase wind velocity. Partly cloudy sky and light rainfall predicted in UP, leading to a decline in fog density.106362725Dense fog envelopes parts of North India, reduces visibilityThe winter chill continues to grip North India, with cities like Kanpur and Aligarh experiencing dense fog. Locals gather around bonfires for warmth as the mercury drops even lower. Visibility in several parts of Delhi drops to 125 meters, while the air quality remains 'very poor'. Non-essential construction work has been banned in the Delhi-NCR.106267801",
