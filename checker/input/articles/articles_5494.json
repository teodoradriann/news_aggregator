    "title": "There Is Near Zero Historical Precedent For Biden DOJ Getting Steve Bannon Thrown In Jail | The Daily Caller",
    "text": "There’s almost no historical precedent for the Biden Department of Justice’s (DOJ) effort to have Steve Bannon serve time in jail for his conviction on contempt of Congress charges.\nAfter an appeals court upheld in May Bannon’s conviction on contempt of Congress charges for ignoring a Jan. 6 select committee subpoena, the DOJ asked the district court judge who initially issued Bannon’s four-month prison sentence to order him to report to prison. Judge Carl J. Nichols agreed Thursday, ending the hold on his nearly unprecedented sentence that had been in place during his appeal.\nBannon now must report to prison by July 1. Besides former President Donald Trump aide Peter Navarro, who is currently serving a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress, one of the most recent historical precedents for such a sentence dates to the Cold War, when a group of writers, directors and producers known as the “Hollywood Ten” were sentenced to jail time for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), according to the Washington Post.\nThe ten believed questions posed by the HUAC violated their First Amendment rights, but the House voted to hold them in contempt in November 1947 for refusing to state whether they were members of the Communist Party, according to Politico.\nMy Statement on Steve Bannon’s Prison Sentence:\nWe have had constitutional executive privilege for 250 years–going back to George Washington–so the President of the United States can receive candid, confidential advice from his advisors without fear their advice will get…\n— 🇺🇸 Mike Davis 🇺🇸 (@mrddmia) June 6, 2024\nFormer Richard Nixon aide G. Gordon Liddy and former Nixon Attorney General Richard Kleindienst pleaded guilty to contempt of Congress charges but did not go to jail, according to the Washington Post. (RELATED: ‘Middle Finger To The House’: Joe Biden Said Subpoena Defiers Should Be Charged. Will His DOJ Arrest Hunter?)\n“While there is a fair amount of precedent for lying to Congress, there is far less for people convicted of contempt of Congress,” John Malcolm, vice president for the Heritage Foundation’s Institute for Constitutional Government and former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Criminal Division, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in January.\nNavarro, former trade advisor to Trump, was ordered to report to a Miami prison on March 19, where he began his four-month sentence. After Navarro was indicted in June 2022, the FBI arrested him at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., when he was heading to a Nashville speaking engagement, according to Politico.\nHunter Biden, who defied a congressional subpoena in December, choosing to hold a press conference on Capitol Hill rather than sit for his deposition, has not yet been found in contempt of Congress.\nCriminal defense attorney and legal analyst Philip Holloway told the Daily Caller News Foundation in December that the law “must be applied equally or it has no meaning,” arguing Hunter Biden should “be held to the same standard” as Bannon.\nThe House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight Committee voted in May to advance resolutions to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for defying their request to turn over audio recordings from special counsel Robert Hur’s interview with President Joe Biden.\nAfter the House voted to cite former President Barack Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress in 2012, Holder faced no jail time, as the DOJ did not initiate criminal prosecution.\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said at the time that it is “an established principle, dating back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, that the Justice Department does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when the president has asserted executive privilege,” according to CNN.\n“We have had constitutional executive privilege for 250 years–going back to George Washington–so the President of the United States can receive candid, confidential advice from his advisors without fear their advice will get publicly aired before courts or Congress,” Mike Davis, founder and president of the Article III Project, wrote Thursday on X. “President Biden and his Attorney General Merrick Garland have shamefully destroyed this, in their partisan quest to politicize and weaponize the Biden Justice Department to go after President Trump and his top aides.”\nBannon said Thursday outside the courthouse that there is “not a prison built or jail built that will ever shut me up.”\n“They’re not going to shut up Trump, they’re not going to shut up Navarro, they’re not going to shut up Bannon, and they’re certainly not going to shut up MAGA,” Bannon said . “There is nothing that can shut me up and there is nothing that will shut me up.”\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "\"Rispetto alla situazione di emergenza che sta vivendo la sede Inps di Vicenza, con una grave carenza di organico che si ripercuote sui servizi all'utenza, devo purtroppo dichiararmi insoddisfatto dalla risposta del governo, o meglio dall'istruttoria predisposta dagli uffici del Ministero del Lavoro. La provincia di Vicenza è la terza in Italia per produzione industriale pro capite. Abbiamo un tessuto industriale straordinariamente fecondo, con imprese che esportano in tutto il mondo. I ritardi nella risposta amministrativa sono inaccettabili\". Lo ha detto il senatore vicentino di Forza Italia Pierantonio Zanettin presentando la sua interrogazione nell'aula del Senato.\n \"Nel 2020 - ha proseguito - l'organico della sede INPS di Vicenza era di 220 persone, oggi sono 184. Per quanto riguarda i dati dell'ultimo concorso, le assegnazioni del 2023 che sono state fatte in Veneto hanno visto arrivare a Vicenza solo 48 risorse. Tra l'altro, alla fine di quest'anno ne resteranno in servizio appena 41. Sono rimasto, peraltro, molto sorpreso del fatto che le chiusure delle sedi Inps di Thiene ed Arzignano, secondo la risposta del Ministero, sarebbero dovute allo scarso interesse da parte dei comuni interessati\". \"La mia interrogazione, infatti, è stata sollecitata anche dal sindaco di Thiene. Credo piuttosto che queste chiusure dipendano, appunto, dalle carenze di organico a cui auspico si possa porre rimedio. Dovremo ragionare su concorsi regionali e sulla possibilità di prevedere alloggi a prezzi calmierati per ovviare alle difficoltà derivanti da stipendi troppo bassi, che creano difficoltà soprattutto ai vincitori di concorso che provengono da altre regioni\", ha concluso.",

    "text": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) has once again raised alarm over the severe repercussions of internet disruptions and the potential blocking of virtual private network (VPN) services, warning that such measures could cripple Pakistan’s thriving IT sector.\nOn Wednesday, Chairperson of P@SHA Sajjad Mustafa Syed appeared on a talk show on a private TV channel and cautioned that banning VPNs could devastate the IT sector “The industry could face a $1 billion loss within the first year, with further declines in subsequent years,” he said.\nHe said that according to preliminary findings, the IT industry has recorded a 30 per cent drop in orders. This, he said, could translate into a revenue loss of billions of dollars. In terms of job losses, this dip in order number will wipe out around 200,000 to 300,000 jobs from the industry.\nThis is not the first time for P@SHA’s wake-up call for the government. In August, when Pakistan faced sudden internet disruptions, the then vice president of P@SHA, Ali Ihsan, released a strongly worded letter where he said that “internet disruptions could inflict devastating financial losses estimated to reach $300 million.”\nSajjad said that not only do internet disruptions result in revenue losses, they also lead to penalties. He said that some time back when there was a two-hour-long internet shutdown, an IT firm was slapped with a $2 million penalty. He said that IT firms are service providers, and they have certain targets to meet. Failure to do so will definitely meet with penalties from clients.\nAddressing concerns, the chairperson said the restriction is reportedly being imposed due to its misuse by terrorists. While acknowledging the significance of national security, he highlighted that such challenges exist globally.\n“We stand firmly with our institutions in the fight against terrorism. However, the white-listing approach for VPNs will harm the IT sector,” he added. Syed proposed an alternative solution, suggesting the establishment of an industry for VPN service providers to ensure monitoring and prevent misuse by terrorists.\nSyed urged the government to avoid a blanket ban on VPNs, advocating instead for a collaborative approach involving P@SHA, industry leaders, and stakeholders to create a balanced and secure framework.\n“We must safeguard national security without jeopardising the operational needs of Pakistan’s IT sector, which is vital for the country’s economic growth,” he concluded.",

    "text": "La rottura tra Megan Fox e Machine Gun Kelly risale allo scorso dicembre, quando lei secondo il gossip avrebbe scoperto messaggi compromettenti sul cellulare del compagno. L'attrice trentottenne, solo un mese prima, aveva annunciato via social di aspettare il suo quarto figlio, il primo con il trentaquattrenne musicista. Ma ora i rapporti tra gli ex fidanzati sarebbero «così gelidi che non è chiaro se Machine Gun Kelly sarà presente quando nascerà il bambino». Lo scrive Tmz, precisando che è stata Megan Fox a voler interrompere ogni contatto col cantante: «Non vuole avere niente a che fare con l'ex. E tutti coloro che la circondano ne sono felici. Sentono che, allontanandolo dalla sua vita, è tornata in sé».\nLa storia tra Megan Fox e Machine Gun Kelly - che si sono conosciuti nel 2019 girando una clip musicale - era sta ufficializzata via social nel luglio 2020 (solo tre mesi prima lei aveva detto addio al marito Brian Austin Green, da cui ha avuto tre figli). Durante i quattro anni di fidanzamento l'attrice e il cantante, tra rotture e ritorni di fiamma, ci avevano abituato a ogni sorta di bizzarria. Ad esempio nell'aprile 2022 lei in un'intervista aveva rivelato: «Beviamo il sangue l'uno dell'altra». Precisando, forse a vantaggio dei lettori troppo impressionabili, che la gente «non deve immaginarci con i calici in stile Game of Thrones mentre beviamo il nostro sangue. Sono solo poche gocce in realtà». Qualche mese prima Megan, postando una foto in cui il rapper le faceva la proposta di nozze, aveva scritto: «Mi ha chiesto di sposarlo. E proprio come in ogni vita prima di questa, e come in ogni vita che seguirà, ho detto sì… e poi abbiamo bevuto il sangue l’una dell’altro».\nIl matrimonio non è mai stato celebrato, e lo scorso dicembre è arrivata la notizia dell'ennesima rottura tra i due: «Durante una vacanza in Colorado per il Giorno del Ringraziamento», aveva spiegato a Tmz una fonte vicina all'ex coppia, «Megan ha iniziato ad avere dei sospetti, ha controllato il telefono del fidanzato e ha trovato messaggi compromettenti che coinvolgevano altre donne. Così ha deciso di lasciarlo». Da allora i due non si sarebbero più visti. E i rapporti sarebbero così gelidi che lui, alla nascita del loro bambino, potrebbe non essere presente.",

    "text": "The stormwater drain connecting the lakes of Masab Cheruvu, Dilavar Khan Cheruvu and Pedda Amberpet Cheruvu towards Ibrahimpatnam area of Rangareddy district is set to be developed as a model drain.\nHyderabad Disaster Response & Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) commissioner A.V. Ranganath revealed the plans to develop the 7.5 kilometre drain, in order to prevent inundation. A coordination meeting will be organised soon with officials from Revenue, Municipal, Irrigation and other departments, to prepare a plan of action, he said.\nMr. Ranganath, together with the MLA of Ibrahimpatnam Malreddy Ranga Reddy inspected the lower reaches of the drain on Wednesday (July 9, 2025) in view of several complaints of inundation from the residents of surrounding colonies. He inspected the double bedroom houses at Jalikunta between Masab Cheruvu and Dilavar Khan Cheruvu, and the structures stalled owing to inundation of basement nearby.\nSince the area is not fully constructed, the drain has the scope of modification based on the future needs, Mr. Ranganath said, and urged the local residents to ensure that the lakes are free of encroachment. He assured action against encroachers of Masab Cheruvu. He also inspected the obstacles for nala widening at Karmanghat and Badangpet, and visited the Raviryal Lake.\nPublished - July 10, 2025 01:47 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

Every contending WNBA team boasts several stars, and Williams helps the Storm get level to the teams they’re chasing.\nWilliams was crucial to the Storm’s win against the second-place Connecticut Sun on Tuesday, with 11 points, six rebounds, five assists and a steal to go with 5-for-8 shooting from the field. The Sun are a team the Storm may end up seeing in the playoffs, so getting the win factors in as a huge confidence boost. As Williams acclimates back to WNBA basketball after the Olympics, her impact will continue to grow on Seattle’s roster.\nWilliams was drafted fourth overall out of UConn in 2018 by the Chicago Sky and spent her first three WNBA seasons with that franchise. Now, she’s in her third season with the Storm. She also has a lengthy résumé in the Euroleague and plays for the French national team.\nSeattle Storm forward Gabby Williams dribbles the ball against the New York Liberty at Climate Pledge Arena on May 29, 2022. Stephen Brashear-Imagn Images\nFans were stunned by Williams and the French when they nearly beat Team USA in the gold medal game at the Paris Olympics, ultimately falling 67-66. She averaged 14.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 2.8 steals per game for the silver medalists.\nSeattle made some huge moves in free agency by attracting Skylar Diggins-Smith and Nneka Ogwumike. They join Jewell Loyd to lead this Storm roster, and Ezi Magbegor has blossomed into an excellent center as well. Ultimately, Williams’ veteran presence bonds well alongside Seattle’s other stars. Teams need veteran experience to succeed in the playoffs, as they usually know how to keep calm and meet the moment. Williams may not have snatched the gold medal, but she played phenomenally under pressure in Paris.\nWilliams is the kind of player who affects a game in myriad ways. She doesn’t always rack up points, but she is an elite defender and passer. On a roster where you have shooters like Loyd and Diggins-Smith in the backcourt and Ogwumike and Magbegor in the frontcourt, a passer like Williams is like glue. She’s strong enough to drive to the basket when needed and has the size to crash the glass. On the defensive side, her strength and wingspan make her a scary matchup.\nHaving a versatile player like Williams on a playoff team serves a variety of purposes — for one, a player who’s willing to do the dirty work on the court is essential. Plus, she knows the staff and team atmosphere from her previous seasons with the Storm. Seattle could not have done any better in terms of a midseason acquisition.\nWilliams might have extra motivation this postseason. Virtually every team the Storm could face in the postseason will have a member of the Team USA squad that edged out France for gold just a month ago. Maybe Williams will be playing for a WNBA championship with a little bit of redemption on the side.
