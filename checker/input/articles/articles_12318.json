    "text": "Мальчик появился на свет в Рязани В России появился на свет самый крупный на данный момент в 2025 году ребенок. В Рязанском перинатальном центре родился мальчик весом 5080 граммов. Это второй ребенок в семье. Известно, что и первый тоже родился крупным, но новорожденный брат побил все рекорды, как семейные, так и медцентра. Врачи-неонатологи внимательно следили за состоянием малыша после рождения. Как объяснили специалисты перинатального центра, такой вес может быть связан с особенностями конституции ребенка или с осложнениями во время беременности матери. Обследование не выявило у...

    "text": "Naomi Campbell tiene una nueva ilusión: el productor saudí Mohammed Al Turki\nNaomi Campbell siempre ha hecho todo lo posible para proteger al máximo su vida privada. A día de hoy, la estrella de las pasarelas sigue sin revelar los nombres de sus dos hijos, de los que tampoco ha precisado si nacieron o no a través de un vientre de alquiler. Y sobre su vida amorosa, la modelo mantiene un silencio sepulcral. Sin embargo, fuentes de su entorno han dado a conocer ahora que la maniquí, de 53 años, habría recuperado la ilusión de la mano de un empresario y productor cinematográfico saudí: Mohammed Al Turki, de 37 años.\nEl diario The Sun asegura que la pareja lleva varias semanas afianzando su relación en Dubái, donde él tiene su centro de operaciones. Asimismo, su romance se estaría consolidando gracias a su pasión compartida por la moda. “Han intimado por su amor por la moda y el arte, y tienen muchos amigos en común. Naomi ha estado en Dubái y nunca se le había visto tan feliz”, ha explicado un informante al periódico.\nSus allegados no se atreven todavía a augurar un gran futuro a la pareja, pero las primeras señales son prometedoras. “Naomi es muy selectiva con la gente de su círculo. Pero pasan mucho tiempo juntos y se nota que saltan chispas entre ellos. Aunque lo suyo no sea más que una amistad en este punto”, matizan. Sólo el tiempo dirá si Naomi Campbell se anima a hacer público su nuevo idilio, como ya hiciera con su última pareja conocida, el empresario ruso Vladislav Doronin, entre los años 2008 y 2013.\nEn los últimos meses, Naomi Campbell ha venido compartiendo, de forma muy medida, algunos detalles de su flamante etapa en la maternidad. A su paso por el programa de la televisión italiana ‘Che tempo che fa’, la modelo reveló que sus dos retoños, una niña de dos años y un niño que acaba de cumplir ocho meses, habían sido bautizados en Milán con la inestimable ayuda de dos amigos muy queridos, los diseñadores Stefano Dolce y Domenico Gabbana. “Esta foto es de hace unas semanas, para el bautizo de mi hijo. Stefano y Domenico nos dieron los vestidos. Mis dos hijos fueron bautizados, fue algo hermoso”, señalaba.",

    "text": "NFL player props: 5 best bets for Wild Card Weekend After fighting all season to get to the playoffs, weather could be the most dominant factor in 2 of the games and will have an impact on a couple of this week's Wild Card Weekend. Below, we analyze [BetMGM Sportsbook's](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752) NFL odds and lines, and tab the best NFL Wild Card Weekend player prop bets to cash in on among SportbookWire's [NFL expert picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/). For this week's picks, we have a running back going Over his projection in the freezing conditionals in Kansas City, a QB rushing for a TD in the snow in Buffalo, 2 running backs not hitting their numbers in climate-controlled conditions and one of the most dynamic wide receivers dominating his matchup. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: [Get ESPN+](https://go.web.plus.espn.com/GjNV9m) NFL Wild Card Weekend prop bet picks and predictions Odds provided by [BetMGM Sportsbook](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752); access [USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores) for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.

Más contenido a continuación Disculpa el inconveniente. Algo salió mal. Inténtalo de nuevo más tarde. Más contenido a continuación LNKD FORBESCO.BO Forbes Argentina 28 de diciembre de 2023, 9:10 p. m. · 5 min de lectura En este artículo: Disculpa el inconveniente. Algo salió mal. Inténtalo de nuevo más tarde. Más contenido a continuación Disculpa el inconveniente. Algo salió mal. Inténtalo de nuevo más tarde. Más contenido a continuación LNKD FORBESCO.BO\nDesde que leí el libro Permission to Feel: Unlocking the Power of Emotions to Help Our Kids, Ourselves, and Our Society Thrive del Dr. Mark Brackett , director del Centro de Investigación de Inteligencia Emocional de Yale; estuve haciéndome preguntas más difíciles como ¿Por qué está desplomándose la salud mental, emocional, el bienestar y, por lo tanto, la felicidad ?\nAcá tiene mis reflexiones apoyadas en un breve proceso de evaluación junto a su equipo de liderazgo (vale la pena un cierre al 2024) después de todo la felicidad importa, es fundamental para el crecimiento y la prosperidad de su organización.\n¿Por qué nuestro mundo está tan estresado en comparación a cuando era niña? Siempre hubo guerras y conflictos mundiales: las guerras de Corea y Vietnam, la del Cuerno de África con Somalia y Etiopía, la guerra entre Irán e Irak, la guerra entre Ucrania y Rusia y la reciente guerra entre Israel y Hamás (Gaza).\nSiempre hubo problemas de cambio climático asolando nuestro mundo, aunque más recientemente, estamos experimentando una intensidad en el aumento de los incendios forestales, el desplome de los casquetes polares y más especies en peligro de extinción, por lo que nadie puede cuestionar que la madre Tierra necesita más protección.\nSiempre tuvimos políticos nobles y señoriales, como Winston Churchill (Reino Unido), Barack Obama (EE.UU.), Angela Merkel (Alemania), pero últimamente parece que tenemos políticos más dramáticos, como Donald Trump (EE.UU.) o Boris Johnson (Reino Unido). Y por supuesto una serie de líderes en Rusia e Irán que están en contra de la democracia y la igualdad de derechos.\nTal es así, que nuestro mundo definitivamente se siente más políticamente polarizado entre el Este y el Oeste, lo cual es muy preocupante geopolíticamente.\nLo que sí cambió drásticamente y nuestros hijos toman por normal son las innovaciones tecnológicas a hiperescala que están por todas partes, como la televisión, el teléfono móvil, la computadora personal, internet, las redes sociales ( Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn ), ChatGPT4 , autos eléctricos ( Tesla ), cohetes que llevan a los ciudadanos a la luna, la IA que sustenta todos los modelos de negocio y, por supuesto, los alimentos sin gluten, etc. (Siempre hemos comido pizzas, aunque ahora disfrutamos más de las de masa fina).\nContinuar leyendo la historia Hay alarmantemente más: ansiedad + depresión + suicidio = > reclamos de salud médica, > riesgos de seguridad cibernética = ataques de ransomware, > tasas de divorcio = más complejidades familiares, > comida basura = > diabetes y sobrepeso en niños, adolescentes y adultos, etc, > inflación = > costo de vida, > robots/cobots =< empleos, ChatGPT =< empleos en funciones/tareas altamente repetitivas .\nComo resultado de nuestro mundo cambiante, nos encontramos en un lugar en el que los seres humanos están cada vez más estresados. Como escribí en muchos de mis artículos de Forbes , entre el 20% y el 30% de los empleados se levantan tristes o enfadados cada día.\nHay poco tiempo para distenderse en el trabajo, ya que las empresas siguen ahuecando las funciones que pueden automatizarse o externalizarse.\nSin embargo, como líderes sabemos que necesitamos que nuestra gente esté capacitada y se presente a trabajar feliz para ser más productiva. Debemos esforzarnos por mantener a nuestras organizaciones en una trayectoria de crecimiento sana y positiva (hacia arriba, eso sí). No es un trabajo fácil, ya que nuestros líderes están siempre estresados y muchos operan cerca de estados de agotamiento.\nSi tuvo la oportunidad de hablar recientemente con un CEO, sabrá que no es un papel fácil.\nPara ayudar a los líderes a reflexionar sobre la importancia de la salud mental , así como de invertir en más sistemas de apoyo al compromiso y la motivación de los empleados, desarrollé una breve encuesta de evaluación, que permite hacer un balance de dónde se encuentran sus organizaciones en el viaje hacia el bienestar.\nEl objetivo final es ayudarles a desarrollar una mirada más aguda sobre las prácticas operativas obsoletas con un claro enfoque en el aumento de la felicidad de los empleados.\nDesafiando a las encuestas anuales que llegan demasiado tarde para ser útiles y que a menudo tienen datos que no son fiables en un 50%, necesitamos modernizar realmente nuestros métodos de compromiso de los empleados de RR.HH., ya que el medidor de la felicidad no va en la dirección correcta.\nEscala: 1-7 / 1: sin pruebas, 7: muy sólido y fuerte.\n1- Por qué: caso para la acción. ¿Desarrolló un caso sólido para la acción o un caso empresarial con una validación clara / hechos relevantes recopilados sobre por qué la salud mental y la felicidad son importantes para su organización? ¿Conoce las causas profundas de la infelicidad de los empleados y qué acciones está llevando a cabo para mejorar el compromiso y la retención de los empleados?\n2- Qué: contexto integrado. ¿Identificó un modelo holístico con dimensiones/pilares integrados de salud mental/bienestar para guiar la madurez de la experiencia de sus empleados (es decir, reflexionar, actualizar, integrar)?\n3- Cómo: modelado de roles . ¿En qué medida están equipados sus líderes para servir de modelo y ofrecer auténticamente los resultados deseados en materia de salud/bienestar mental y ser entrenadores eficaces?\n4- Cómo: prácticas de RRHH. ¿En qué medida diseña y aplica programas y prácticas de RR.HH. para atraer, desarrollar y retener a sus empleados según un conjunto medible de indicadores clave de rendimiento de salud mental y bienestar?\n5- Cómo: sostenibilidad de la cultura. ¿Cómo se desarrolló su cultura corporativa para demostrar su auténtico apoyo a la salud mental, el bienestar y la seguridad?\nEn mi opinión, no hay nada más importante que saber si sus empleados se sienten motivados cada mañana para afrontar los desafíos del día, si se sienten capacitados y si saben que usted se preocupa auténticamente por su aporte único.\nMantener a salvo las voces de sus empleados de forma anónima es fundamental para crear confianza y seguridad.\nAsimismo, si los empleados quieren ser conocidos por sus voces, brindarles la opción de compartir abiertamente lo que tienen en mente es un camino para construir una cultura más resistente que tenga un fuerte sentido del propósito corporativo.\nNota publicada en Forbes US.\nMÁS POPULARES 1.

    "text": "El pamplonica Urko Berrade colocó el triplete en el casillero del Kern Pharma con una victoria en solitario en la decimoctava etapa de la Vuelta disputada entre Vitoria y Maeztu, de 179,3 kilómetros, en la que resistió con el maillot rojo el australiano Ben O'Connor y Mikel Landa se hundió de la quinta a la décima plaza de la general. No hubo dos sin tres y el Kern Pharma, equipo continental que corre como invitado en la Vuelta y que ya tenía dos triunfos con Pablo Castrillo en Manzaneda y Cuitu Negru, hizo el \"hat trick\" con un chico nacido en Pamplona hace 26 años: Urko Berrade, capaz de atacar a 5 km de meta y de llegar en solitario a la pequeña localidad alavesa de Maeztu para celebrar su primer éxito como profesional. Berrade, en presencia de su pareja y familia, salió el la foto del ganador, entrando en meta solo, con un tiempo de 4h.00.52, a una media de 43,3 km/hora. Dejó a sus compañeros de fuga a 4 segundos, con el suizo Mauro Schmide segundo, y otro Kern Pharma tercero, el esprinter Pau Miquel. Fiesta del cuadro navarro a un paso de su casa. Dentro del 'top ten' de la etapa entraron el local Oier Lazkano, Ion Izagirre y Pablo Castrillo. El grupo principal con los favoritos entró en meta a 6.40. Solo faltaba Mikel Landa, quien se dejó 3.20 minutos y descendió al décimo puesto de la general. El gran derrotado de la jornada en su propia casa. Un día más resistió el australiano O'Connor abrazado al maillot rojo, tal vez por último día ante la llegada de las etapas claves de montaña este fin de semana. Momentos decisivos en los que entrará con 5 segundos de ventaja sobre Primoz Roglic, 1.25 respecto a Enric Mas, con Carapaz a 1.46, Gaudu a 3.48 y Carlos Rodríguez es sexto a 3.53. Luz verde de los favoritos a una fuga multitudinaria Etapa cien por cien alavesa, propicia para la fuga, y con opciones para los velocistas con aptitudes escaladoras. De entrada se impuso la primera opción del guión con una expedición masiva de 42 corredores, idónea para que los hombres de la general reservaran fuerzas para un fin de semana explosivo y decisivo con Moncalvillo, Picón Blanco y la crono de Madrid. Delante se metieron el rey del esprint, Kaden Groves, Lazkano, Soler, Castrillo, Herrada, Izagirre, Vlasov, el mejor clasificado a 24 minutos, Narváez, McNulty... un grupo de calidad que poco a poco fue gestionando la victoria entre ellos. La marabunta coronó el Alto de Rivas de Tereso (2a, 11,1 km al 3,4) con 4 minutos de ventaja. El grupo cabecero se fue alterando entre los dos puertos del día. Los suizos Kung y Schmid y el checo Vacek abrieron las hostilidades adelantándose al resto, pero en el ascenso al Puerto de Herrera (1a, 5,6 km al 8,3) los ataques iban cambiando el decorado en cada curva. De nuevo atacó Marc Soler cerca de la cima. El catalán ganador en Lagos de Covadonga coronó en cabeza y se convirtió en nuevo líder de la montaña. Por detrás, en el sector de la alta jerarquía, Carapaz marcó un ritmo que puso contra las cuerdas al líder O'Connor y a Mikel Landa, ambos descolgados. En la bajada O'Connor logró enlazar con Roglic, Mas, Carapaz y Gaudu, no así Landa, en serios apuros y poniendo en peligro la quinta plaza de la general. El EF, Groupama-FDJ y Movistar unieron voluntades para aumentar la pérdida de Landa, que era de 2.30 minutos respecto a los hombres de las general a 15 de Maeztu. Berrade sorprende y logra el triplete del Kern Pharma, Landa se hunde Doce hombres sin piedad delante por el triunfo de etapa en Maeztu, pequeño enclave en el sur alavés, a las puertas del Parque Natural de Izki. Un hombre de la tierra, Lazkano, entre ellos, y ausencia en el grupo que perseguía a 7 minutos de Landa, hundiéndose en casa de manera inexorable. Tenían que llegar los ataques. Cada uno con su carta marcada. La presencia de un esprinter como Pau Miquel invitaba a la mayoría a decidir la etapa en la recta de llegada. Por eso atacó el veterano neerlandés del Visma a 6,5 de meta, sin ningún éxito, ya que salió a su rueda Urko Berrade. Mientras el resto se quedaba mirando, ya con las fuerzas mermadas, el navarro residente en Barcelona, donde trabaja su pareja, y compañero de entrenamientos de Pau Miquel, se lanzó directo a por su estreno como profesional a 5.000 metros de la localidad alavesa. Ya no miró atrás, sacó todo lo que tenía dentro y atravesó la línea brazos en alto culminando la semana fantástica de su equipo y un sueño de esos que persigue cualquier profesional. Berrade se cayó en Eslovenia, pasó el proceso de recuperación, pero su coraje y una concentración en Sierra Nevada le dieron bríos para llegar en forma a la Vuelta. Sigue la fiesta del Kern Pharma, revelación de la Vuelta 2024. Este viernes se disputa la decimonovena etapa entre Logroño y el Alto de Moncalvillo, de 173,2 km. Penúltimo final en alto de la 79 edición de la Vuelta, con el ascenso al pico riojano (1a, 8,6 km al 8,69). Antes, a mitad de recorrido, el Puerto de Pradilla (3a, 5,2 km al 4,8). Jornada no exenta de la posibilidad de sorpresas. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",
