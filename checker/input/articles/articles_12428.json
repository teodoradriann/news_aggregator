The company, which was blacklisted by the Biden administration in 2021, makes what is widely considered the world's most sophisticated hacking software, which – according to researchers – has been used in the past in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, India, Mexico, Morocco and Rwanda.\nThe timing of the latest development is important in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election. Pegasus has been used by autocratic leaders around the world to target journalists and dissidents, including by the government of Viktor Orbán, who Trump admires.\nNSO has lobbied members of Congress in an attempt to be removed from the Biden administration's so-called blacklist, and Trump's return to the White House could…\nStephanie Kirchgaessner",

Jonas Reyes Published on: 08 Aug 2025, 04:35\nCopied\nSubic Bay Freeport – The revitalization of the shipbuilding industry in this premier Freeport is currently in bloom as the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Philippine (HD-HHIP) is set to augment its already increasing workforce of 1,300.\nDuring an interview thru the Agila Subic Compass media tour held on August 7, 2025, Hyundai HR Manager Ralph David Magno said that they are currently looking for welders, fitters, painters, production engineers, and heavy equipment operators.\n“And we’re expecting more and more applicants in the future. Applicants only need to visit the Facebook page HD HHIP,” he added.\nMagno cited, “Former Hanjin workers have an advantage since they have the skills and the experience, but since HD Hyundai is a different company from Hanjin, so we have the screening process and then afterwards we will consider their applications for employment.”\nWhen asked about the salary, he said, “We are very competitive when it comes to compensation, it will be based on your experience, qualifications and criteria per se. And of course, we offer as well free board and lodging, free shuttle services, free lunch and of course HMO and insurance upon reaching 1 year of service.”\nHD HHIP currently has a workforce of 1,300 employees, as well as a training pool that currently has 140 trainees that will eventually be added to the workforce. Magno said that nine batches of trainees have already graduated, and that the 140 trainees for batch 10 are nearing their graduation.\nFollow Us",
