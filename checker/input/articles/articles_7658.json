    "title": "Jesus Portrait Drawing",
    "text": "Drawing a Jesus Portrait: A Step-by-Step Guide\nOne of the oldest and most iconic images in human history is the portrait of Jesus Christ. It is a powerful image that has inspired painters and artists for centuries. From the earliest frescoes in the Catacombs of Rome to the works of Michelangelo, the image of Jesus has been a source of creativity and inspiration. Today, aspiring artists can learn to draw Jesus themselves with a few simple steps.\nThe most important step in drawing a Jesus portrait is to decide on a pose. It is important to consider the context of the image when deciding on the pose of the figure. Is the image meant to evoke a certain emotion or feeling? Is it meant to depict a specific moment in the life of Jesus? Taking the time to decide on a pose will help the artist create a more meaningful and impactful image.\nGathering the Right Materials\nOnce a pose has been decided on, the artist should gather the necessary materials. For this project, a basic set of drawing materials will suffice. This should include drawing paper, graphite pencils in various shades, a kneaded eraser, and sharpened charcoal pencils. A variety of paintbrushes will also be necessary for painting the final image. It is also a good idea to have a few reference images of Jesus handy for guidance.\nSketching the Image\nThe next step is to begin sketching the image. Using a light graphite pencil, the artist should begin by lightly sketching the basic structure of the figure. This includes the head and torso, as well as the arms and legs. The artist should also sketch in any details, such as facial features and clothing, that will be included in the final image. Once the sketch is complete, it can be refined by adding darker lines and shading.\nAdding Color and Detail\nOnce the sketch is complete, the artist can begin to add color and detail. Using the charcoal pencils, the artist can begin to add shading and texture to the image. The artist should also use paintbrushes to add color to the image, such as for clothing and background elements. The artist should take their time when adding color, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and make mistakes.\nFinal Touches\nThe final step is to add the final touches to the image. This can include adjusting the lighting and shadows, adding highlights to the figure, and making any last-minute changes. Once the image is complete, the artist should take a step back and look at the image as a whole. This will allow the artist to make any final adjustments before the image is considered finished.\nCreating a Jesus portrait is a great way for aspiring painters and artists to practice their skills. With the right materials and a bit of practice, anyone can learn to draw Jesus in a meaningful way. By following the steps outlined in this article, artists can create an image of Jesus that will be cherished for years to come.",

    "title": "Apple Faces New Challenge As Huawei Advances Domestic Chip Tech In Mate 70 Series Amid US Sanctions: Repo",
    "text": "Huawei Technologies Co. is reportedly set to release its most advanced domestically made chip in the Mate 70 series, amid ongoing U.S. sanctions. What Happened: The new chip will power select models in Huawei's Mate 70 lineup, which is expected to launch next week, reported the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. The launch comes as Huawei continues to increase its market share in China, where it has seen a rise in consumer demand. In the third quarter of this year, Huawei's market share in China grew to 15.3% from 8.6% last year, positioning it as a significant competitor to Apple Inc. AAPL in the high-end smartphone market.

The new chips, produced by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation or SMIC, leverage advanced technologies to improve performance and power efficiency, allowing Huawei to compete more effectively with Apple's offerings. “The Mate 70 will continue to put more pressure on Apple in China,” said IDC vice president Bryan Ma, according to the report. Although Huawei's chips still lag behind Apple's in terms of power efficiency, he noted that the difference may not be significant as long as users can get through the day without worrying about charging, the report noted.

Why It Matters: This development coincides with an earlier report that suggested Huawei plans to begin mass production of its new AI chip , the Ascend 910C, in early 2025, despite facing major challenges from U.S. trade restrictions. In May earlier this year, the Joe Biden administration canceled export licenses for leading U.S. semiconductor companies such as Intel Corp. INTC and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, blocking them from providing essential chips to Huawei. During the same month, a report from Counterpoint Research suggested that Huawei surpassed Samsung Electronics Co. SSNLF in global foldable smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2024. Last month, U.S. lawmakers called on the Department of Commerce to take stronger measures against Huawei’s reported efforts to evade sanctions by using a covert network of semiconductor facilities . Price Action: At the time of writing, Apple shares increased by 0.02% to $228.56 in after-hours trading, following a 0.21% decline to $228.52 during Thursday's regular session, according to Benzinga Pro data .
