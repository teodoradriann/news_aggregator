    "title": "Beneficios del té de hojas de guayaba: 6 afecciones gastrointestinales que ayuda a aliviar",
    "text": "L a guayaba es una fruta tropical muy famosa en Colombia . Durante muchos años, esta fruta acompañó los descansos y recreos de millones de niños en el país, pues los padres solían enviárselas en jugo o incluso picada para comer.\nSu popularidad se debe a todos los beneficios nutricionales que tiene, pues tiene una gran cantidad de vitamina C , incluso 4 veces más que la naranja o el limón; además, tiene otras grandes propiedades curativas. Pero, ¿sabía que las hojas de la guayaba también tienen beneficios grandes para el cuerpo? A continuación le contamos cuáles son y por qué es tan recomendada.\n¿Para qué sirven las hojas de la guayaba? La guayaba es considerada por muchos como una súperfruta por sus nutrientes y propiedades . Según el doctor Alberto Sanagustín, médico especialista en medicina familiar y comunitaria, una de sus características más valiosas es que todas sus partes son usadas con fines medicinales .\nUn ejemplo de ello es el uso que se les ha dado a las hojas de la guayaba. Sanagustín explica que esta parte de la fruta tiene:\nPolifenoles : micronutrientes que funcionan como antioxidantes, antiinflamatorios e inmunológicos Flavonoides: funcionan como antiinflamatorios y pueden mejorar la función de los vasos sanguíneos Taninos : son moléculas muy útiles por su capacidad de proteger los tejidos del añejamiento celular Terpenoides : son anticancerígenos Además de lo anterior, el doctor señala que la guayaba y sus hojas pueden ser muy beneficiosas para los dolores menstruales , controlar los niveles de glucosa en sangre, los problemas cardiovasculares y potenciar el sistema inmune.\nTé de hojas de guayaba: la mejor forma de aprovechar sus beneficios De acuerdo con el portal especializado en medicina, WebMD, se han llevado a cabo varios estudios de laboratorios acerca del potencial de las hojas de guayaba . Estas investigaciones han demostrado que su consumo tiene efectos positivos en diferentes afecciones y enfermedades, especialmente gastrointestinales.\nLas infusiones con las hojas de esta fruta se han usado a lo largo de los años para curar algunas afecciones gastrointestinales como:\nDiarrea Náuseas Cólicos menstruales Deshidratación Vómito Gastritis Como explica un artículo de la revista Fitoterapida , esto se debe a que las hojas de la guayaba tienen propiedades antimicrobianas, inhibidoras de la motilidad intestinal, espasmolíticas, antisecretoras y antiinflamatorias . Todo esto se debe a su componente de flavonoides, los cuales son claves para estos efectos curativos.\n¿Cómo se prepara el té de guayaba? Según el artículo, la mejor forma de preparar el té es colocando dos gramos de hojas secas o frescas de guayaba entre 250 y 300 gramos de agua en ebullición. La idea es que se queden así de 5 a 8 minutos.\nEsta infusión se cuela, se puede endulzar con azúcar o miel y se puede tomar de 3 a 4 veces al día según la gravedad de la afección gastrointestinal . En cualquier caso, si los síntomas y dolores son muy fuertes, lo mejor será consultar con un médico para tener más información sobre su estado de salud.",

    "text": "Delhi HC dismisses plea for Shab-e-Barat prayers at Mehrauli mosque site\nAdvocate Shams Khwaja argued that the mosque, believed to be over 600 years old, was illegally razed by DDA officials\nDelhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea seeking permission to offer prayers and visit graves at the site of the recently demolished 600-year-old Akhunji (also referred to as Akhoondji) mosque in the city's Mehrauli area on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.\nJustice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav dismissed the application filed by the Delhi Waqf Board (DWB) managing committee, saying the court is not inclined to issue any directions at this stage, as the matter is already under consideration in a pending petition since 2022.\nJustice Kaurav noted that the site is currently under the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the court has already issued a status quo order on the area where the mosque stood.\nThe court also said the plea for unhindered entry for prayers and visits to the graveyard constitutes a request for a mandatory injunction, which it is not inclined to grant at this time.\nAdvocate Shams Khwaja, representing the managing committee of Delhi Waqf Board, stressed the urgency of the application due to the significance of Shab-e-Barat, a night of forgiveness observed by Muslims. He argued that the demolished mosque, believed to be over 600 years old, was illegally razed by DDA officials.\nHowever, the counsel for the DWB (not the same as DWB's managing committee) opposed the application, disputing the age of the mosque and its status as a waqf property. After hearing both parties, the court dismissed the application.\nEarlier, the court had directed the DDA to maintain status quo specifically in the area where the mosque was situated but clarified that this order does not prevent the DDA from taking action on adjacent areas.\nThe managing committee of DWB alleges that the demolition of the mosque and madrasa was conducted brazenly, leaving the Imam and his family without shelter as their hutment was also destroyed.\nFollow us on:\nGoogle News,\nJoin our official telegram channel (\n@nationalherald) and stay updated with the latest headlines",

    "text": "Отряд Буданова* ждёт под Одессой: Киев готов на тактику кавказских радикалов - Крым в опасности\nКиев готовится использовать тактику кавказских радикалов. Это показали теракты в России. Военный обозреватель заметил, что киевский режим перешёл к \"грязным приёмам\" в конфликте с русскими.\nПоследние действия Киева - атаки на русские аэродромы и подрывы железных дорог - показали, что украинский режим может использовать в конфликте с Россией тактику кавказских радикалов.\nКак отметил военный обозреватель Царьграда Влад Шлепченко, украинская армия всё ещё сильна и может преподнести неприятные \"сюрпризы\". Как пример - переброска в Одесскую область спецназа ГУР, среди которого множество бывших заключённых.\nЗдесь нелишним будет заметить, что такие переброски всегда предшествуют диверсиям. Под Одессой стоит убойный отряд главы ГУР Кирилла Буданова*, во главе опытнейший командир, так что ждём \"сюрпризов\". Тем более что сейчас улучшилась погода, а главное - Украина завершила модернизацию безэкипажных катеров, оснастив их зенитными средствами. Теперь они могут прикрывать десант и сбивать нашу авиацию,\n- указал эксперт.\nФото: Freepik.com\nРусским стоит быть начеку, так как заявления врага о высадке в Крыму - не пустой звук. Как указал Шлепченко, украинцы уже отрабатывали подобные сценарии в декабре 2023 года.\nИх цель - не захват полуострова, а террористический рейд. Враг может применить тактику Басаева: захват заложников, пропагандистский шум,\n- объяснил он.\nКоллаж Царьграда\nПричём даже провальная высадка станет информационным поводом для Запада. И на Киев тут же посыплются новые кредиты и помощь.\n\"Нам же придётся либо штурмовать своих заложников, либо отпустить диверсантов. Нужно понимать, что враг готовится к удару, а мы снова надеемся на \"авось\", - добавил военный обозреватель, отметив, что \"Крым рискует стать территорией для очень больших проблем и наших потерь, как минимум - репутационных\". Ибо пока флот \"не шевелится\", неприятель отрабатывает сценарий, где наши мирные жители - всего лишь разменная монета.\n\"История с ангарами стратегических бомбардировщиков, точнее, история с их отсутствием, учит: игнорирование угрозы обходится дороже превентивных мер\", - подытожил Влад Шлепченко.",

(Foto: Reuters)\nEl mexicoamericano Jaime Jaquez continúa deslumbrando en la NBA con grandes actuaciones que le valieron para repetir como Novato del Mes de la Conferencia Este, además de que puede presumir ya haber eclipsado a LeBron James en la reciente victoria de Miami Heat sobre Los Angeles Lakers.\nJaquez se lució frente a LeBron Cada vez más sólido en el cuadro titular, el jugador de 22 años se empieza a acostumbrar a atraer los reflectores, tal y como sucedió la noche del miércoles ante Lakers, en partido donde colaboró con ocho asistencias y 16 puntos que catapultaron la victoria de 110-96, además que realizó de un par de jugadas que sorprendieron a la superestrella estadounidense.\nEn la primera de ellas se valió de una exacta asistencia de Kyle Lowry para hacer un ‘alley oop’ sin que LeBron lo alcanzara en la marca, mientras que en la segunda fue capaz de darse la media vuelta a pesar de tener al de Lakers a sus espaldas, lo que le valió el reconocimiento de los aficionados del Heat, que lo ven ya como una estrella en crecimiento.\nLa NBA reconoce a Jaquez Lo de anoche sólo viene a confirmar el gran momento de Jaquez, mismo que la NBA volvió a reconocer, ya que repitió como el Novato del Mes en la Conferencia Este.\nEn la página del Heat se destaca el reconocimiento, acompañado de datos que demuestran por qué es un digno ganador.\nEn el mes de diciembre promedio 16.1 puntos por partido, lo que le coloca como el tercero entre todos los novatos, además de que que alcanzó 3.8 rebotes y 2.7 ​​asistencias con un 48.1 por ciento de tiros, un 32.4 por ciento de tres.\nEn Navidad fue su mejor actuación en el lapso, ya que totalizó 31 puntos, los cuales lo colocan como la séptima mayor cantidad de puntos anotados por un novato en esa fecha. Además sumó 10 rebotes para concretar su primer doble-doble de su carrera.\nDicha cifra no la lograba un novato en los últimos 38 años y se une así a históricos como Patrick Ewing, Walk Bellamy, Oscar Robertson y Wilt Chamberlain en ser los únicos en hacerlo el 25 de diciembre.",

    "text": "Alcaldía: Tribunal Agroambiental autoriza ingreso de basura por siete meses a K’ara K’ara\nEl secretario de Finanzas de la Alcaldía de Cochabamba, Mauricio Muñoz, informó que la Sala Especializada Primera del Tribunal Agroambiental (Sucre) dio curso a que la basura que se genera en la ciudad ingrese al relleno sanitario de K’ara K’ara durante siete meses más, hasta diciembre de este 2025.\nUna determinación del Juzgado Agroambiental de la Provincia Cercado del departamento de Cochabamba restringió el ingreso de residuos sólidos, desde el 21 de abril, al botadero de K’ara K’ara.\nDesde entonces, durante dos semanas, se generó un problema que no hallaba salidas, mientras la basura se acumulaba por montones en distintos puntos. Cada día, la ciudad genera alrededor de 700 toneladas de desechos.\nEl Complejo Industrial Verde firmó el 16 de abril un contrato con la Alcaldía cochabambina para hacerse cargo del cierre técnico del botadero y de la industrialización de los desechos. Entonces, comprometió al menos tres sitios (el alcalde Manfred Reyes Villa dijo que eran cuatro) para llevar la basura. Pero hubo rechazo en los distintos sectores. Ante esa situación, la Municipalidad rescindió el contrato, el 2 de mayo; y contrató de manera temporal al Complejo Industrial Cochabamba Tunqui para que se haga cargo del recojo de la basura que continuaba acumulándose.\nLa Alcaldía aseguró que esta empresa tiene una celda construida en terreno privado, en Cotapachi en Quillacollo, donde se han estado estos días llevando los residuos sólidos.\nEn paralelo, las autoridades municipales continuaron acciones en el ámbito legal, primero de apelación y luego de casación (que llegó hasta Sucre), pidiendo que se amplíe el uso del botadero de K’ara K’ara por unos 10 meses más, tiempo estimado para garantizar el cierre, sin complicaciones, de la celda número 2; y lapso que también daría un respiro al conflicto, en tanto se consolida una solución estructural.\nDIÁLOGO Este miércoles, las autoridades municipales dijeron que existe la autorización para el ingreso de basura durante siete meses, y que incluso podrían hacerlo desde esta jornada. Sin embargo, buscarán el diálogo con los comunarios de K’ara K’ara, quienes han mantenido vigilias en rechazo a que vuelvan a entrar residuos sólidos a ese sector.",

El presidente Noboa, con apenas un mes en el Gobierno, no ha presentado una sola línea de su plan. En la práctica no hay nada\", dijo Pérez a En órbita. De acuerdo al entrevistado, el problema no es la falta de recintos, sino la necesidad de una \"mayor cantidad de efectivos policiales\" y de una \"política de rehabilitación social responsable\". \"Hay más de 50 cárceles con unas 40.000 personas y hay hacinamiento en la mayoría de estas.

    "text": "08 May 2025\nUK’s 10 major supermarkets failing to meet their climate commitment promises\nREVEALED: UK’s 10 major supermarkets make a climate commitment every six days – but failing against own promises\nNew research released today reveals that – despite the UK’s 10 major supermarkets making an environmental commitment every six days over the past decade – there is little evidence of sufficient progress or consistent public transparency.\nNew analysis(1) of the past decade by charity Feedback Global, with support from The Food Foundation, showed that 600 commitments were set by the top 10 major retailers between 2014 and 2024 relating to climate and emissions, land use and deforestation, and sustainable and healthy diets.\nDespite this, the sector as a whole is failing to deliver consistent and rapid progress, particularly on key areas such as Greenhouse gas emissions generated in supermarkets’ supply chains, known as Scope 3 emissions, which account for a huge 90% of retailers’ carbon footprints.\nFor example, while nine out of 10 retailers assessed have set supply chain emissions reduction targets for 2030, only four are publishing UK specific progress updates – with only Aldi, Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons showing progress in the right direction.\nTo hit national climate targets, the retail sector will have to start being more transparent and disclosing data on key sustainability metrics so they can be held to account on whether they are meeting targets. This will lead to measurable targets, rather than ambiguous commitments.\nThe food sector accounts for approximately a third (35%) of the UK’s territorial greenhouse gas emissions, yet progress in reducing emissions lags behind the rest of the economy(2).\nMeanwhile, the ten largest supermarkets make up 94.8% of the food retail market, meaning they have a pivotal role in reaching – or jeopardising – climate and biodiversity goals.\nWhile the making of climate commitments is a positive step, if businesses fail to reveal data on their progress it is easy for commitments to go unmet. Without mandatory reporting, supermarkets can make meaningless pledges, and it is impossible for anyone on the outside to hold them to account.\nThat’s why, as the government sits down with food industry insiders and others to consider its forthcoming food strategy, charities Feedback Global and The Food Foundation say it’s high time to level the playing field by requiring all large food businesses to disclose data on key sustainability and health metrics. Businesses should also look to set measurable targets to promote healthy and sustainable diets and meet net zero goals.\nAs the government’s Climate Change Committee has set out(3), meeting UK climate goals will mean changing our diets, to include healthier, plant-based foods and fewer meat and dairy-based meals.\nThe UK’s recent Carbon Budget set an explicit target to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 39% by 2040, including a 27% reduction in cattle and sheep numbers and 25% reduction in all meat consumption by 2040.\nYet retailers are failing to keep pace, with only just over half of 49 current commitments on healthy and sustainable diets including measurable targets.\nWhile progress on Scope 3 emissions lags behind, positively, all major retailers have set Scope 1 and 2 emissions(4) targets – which stem from sources directly controlled by the company – and are overall on track to meet these on or ahead of time.\nThis is very likely being driven by the increasing number of mandatory corporate reporting directives requiring businesses to publicly disclose data on their environmental impact. UK companies are already required to disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in their annual reports, in line with the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework.\nThis examination of a decade of voluntary action by UK supermarkets has revealed the government must lead and support the food retail sector on a fundamental transformation to genuinely meet its climate and sustainability commitments.\nJessica Sinclair Taylor, Deputy Director at Feedback Global, said: \"Supermarkets’ voluntary climate commitments clearly aren’t going to cut it when it comes to climate goals.\n\"What’s more, retailers themselves privately admit they need government support to level the playing field and reach their goals.\n\"As the climate and nature crisis gains pace – last year’s harvest was the worst on record - leaving the industry to mark its own copybook simply isn’t good enough.\n\"We need to see the urgent introduction of mandatory, legally-binding standards for all major food businesses when the government publishes its highly anticipated food strategy later this year.\"\nRebecca Tobi, Senior business and investor engagement manager at The Food Foundation, said: \"We are running out of time to avert the climate crisis and as this research very clearly shows it's becomingly increasingly obvious that businesses simply can't do this on their own.\n\"While all UK supermarkets are signed up to a huge number of commendable schemes working towards net zero and more sustainable diets, we are just not seeing the pace of progress we so urgently need for both people and planet.\n\"So, it's critical that the government make sure that the new food strategy ensures mandatory reporting against key health and sustainability metrics and brings in regulation that truly levels the playing field for all food businesses.\"\nSophie Lawrence, Stewardship and Engagement Lead, Greenbank, said: \"As a sustainable investor, we are interested in the long-term resilience of companies and their ability to adapt in the face of the several sustainability challenges we face.\n\"We are increasingly aware of the material financial risks facing food sector companies related to issues such as diet-related poor health, nature loss and climate change.\n\"While we welcome the growing ambition from food sector companies to better manage social and environmental impacts across their operations and supply chains, it is vital that such commitments are backed up by data and disclosures to enable investors and other stakeholders to assess whether promises are being met.\"\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nPlease contact Juliet Grant on 07929075489 or email juliet.grant@foodfoundation.org.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n(1) Commitment issues: Why UK retailers’ climate commitments are failing to deliver and what can be done to fix it https://foodfoundation.org.uk/news/why-uk-retailers-climate-commitments-are-failing-deliver-and-what-can-be-done-fix-it\nThis research used the best available data on retailer targets and reporting in the public domain in January and February 2025. It looked at climate and healthy diets targets across the past decade, from 2014-2024, covering:\n- Climate amibition and greenhouse gas reduction targets and progress: SBTi dashboard and publicly available annual, sustainability and impact reports, and press releases.\n- Sustainable diets targets: publicly available annual, sustainability and impact reports, and press releases.\nData collected was shared with individual retailers for comments or correction.\n(2) The Broken Plate 2025: The State of the Nation’s Food System, by Food Foundation, found that while UK emissions for the whole economy fell by 38% between 2008 and 2022, emissions from the food system fell by just 17% over the same period of time, showing the food sector is lagging behind. https://foodfoundation.org.uk/sites/default/files/2025-04/TFF_The%20Broken%20Plate%202025.pdf\n(3) The Climate Change Committee, The Seventh Carbon Budget: https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/the-seventh-carbon-budget/\n(4) Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organisation.
