These vessels then leak fluid into the eye, causing blurred vision or blind spots .\nWhile it isn’t certain why wet AMD develops, researchers have linked it to the overproduction of a protein in the eyes, called “vascular endothelial growth factor” (VEGF).\n“Real-world evidence shows patients are losing significant vision over time.”\nJeffrey S. Heier The good news is that medications, called “ anti-VEGFs ,” can now block VEGF, restoring vision or at least stopping the progression of wet AMD. The bad news: they have to be injected directly into the eye every 4 to 8 weeks, sometimes indefinitely.\nUnderstandably, patients have a very hard time with this.\n“Wet AMD is a chronic, life-long disease,” said Jeffrey S. Heier, director of retina research at Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston (OCB). “[R]eal-world evidence shows patients are losing significant vision over time, and the burden of frequent anti-VEGF injections needed to manage their wet AMD is a major reason why.”\nWhat’s new? Maryland-based biotech company REGENXBIO is developing a one-shot gene therapy for wet AMD, called ABBV-RGX-314. It delivers genetic instructions for making anti-VEGF proteins into the eye, essentially teaching it to create its own medicine.\n“This is the largest in vivo gene therapy program ever conducted.”\nSteve Pakola On March 28, REGENXBIO published the results of a phase 1/2a trial of the gene therapy, which is now being administered to participants in phase 3 trials.\n“Based on this data, we created a global strategic collaboration with [pharmaceutical company] AbbVie to start a 1,200-patient pivotal program,” Steve Pakola, REGENXBIO’s chief medical officer, told Gen Edge . “This is the largest in vivo gene therapy program ever conducted.”\nThe trial: During the early stage trial, 42 people who had been treated with anti-VEGFs for their wet AMD received a single subretinal injection of ABBV-RGX-314, in one of five dosing levels.\nTrial participants were then followed for two years. If a participant’s vision worsened during that time, a trial investigator could opt to administer a traditional anti-VEGF injection.\nThere was one serious adverse event that may have been linked to the gene therapy — a participant experienced pigmentary changes in their macula and severe vision reduction one year after treatment — but it was otherwise well tolerated and appeared safe.\nParticipants that received what were considered therapeutic doses saw their vision either stabilize or improve, and most participants required few, if any, injections of anti-VEGFs during the trial.\n“A single treatment of ABBV-RGX-314 … would offer a novel approach to treating this serious and blinding disease.”\nJeffrey S. Heier The limitation: Subretinal injections are more complex and invasive than the ones used to administer traditional anti-VEGFs — they must be done in an operating room and require a surgeon to perform a highly challenging technique called a “pars plana vitrectomy.”\nTrial investigators are now testing an alternative method where ABBV-RGX-314 is delivered to a part of the eye called the “suprachoroidal space,” a procedure that could be performed in a doctor’s office.\nLooking ahead: REGENXBIO aims to apply for approval with the FDA in late-2025 or the first half of 2026, and even if subretinal injection is the only delivery method that works, people with wet AMD might decide that one of those procedures is preferable to many injections of anti-VEGFs.\n“A single treatment of ABBV-RGX-314 that can potentially provide long-lasting treatment outcomes and a strong safety profile would offer a novel approach to treating this serious and blinding disease,” said Heier, who is the trial’s primary investigator.\nWe’d love to hear from you!

    "title": "Most Powerful Solar Flare in 7 Years Blasts Earth: Expect Stunning Auroras",
    "text": "The Sun just unleashed the most powerful flare we've seen in seven years. On October 3, a flare measured at a strength of X9.0 [exploded right in the middle of the solar disk](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/another-r3-strong-flare-erupts-region-3842-03-october-2024). Even more excitingly, it was accompanied by what is known as a halo coronal mass ejection – one that is ejected straight at Earth. It's the second X-class flare of October 2024, both emitted from the same active sunspot region, and the most powerful since September 2017, when the Sun unleashed a ripper, later determined to [clock in at X11.88](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/solar-activity/top-50-solar-flares.html). Solar flares are currently rampant because the Sun is in the [peak of its 11-year activity cycle](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-suns-rampant-activity-is-likely-to-peak-really-really-soon-study), letting them off [daily since early 2022](https://www.sciencealert.com/solar-storms-are-lashing-earth-and-you-re-going-to-be-fine). Most of the flares are smaller explosions, but we're definitely seeing an uptick in X-class flares, the most powerful category that we can measure. The X9.0 of October 3 is among [the top 20 most powerful flares on record](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/solar-activity/top-50-solar-flares.html). It erupted from a sunspot region called AR 3842, which has a particularly [complex magnetic configuration](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/help/the-magnetic-classification-of-sunspots.html) referred to as a 'Beta-Gamma-Delta' classification. Sunspots are spots on the Sun where the magnetic field is temporarily stronger. They're also magnetically messy; magnetic field lines of opposite polarity can tangle, snap, and reconnect. This reconnection unleashes a burst of energy – a solar flare. Beta-Gamma sunspot regions contain zones of opposing polarity that don't easily connect. Deltas have opposing polarities crammed into a smaller space, which raises the chances the whole spot will become a region of repeat, intense activity. This is what we're seeing now with AR 3842. On October 1, [it unleashed an X7.1 flare](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sun-unleashed-a-huge-solar-flare-at-earth-and-were-on-aurora-alert). Then it upped the ante with the X9.0. Solar flares can be disruptive to Earth. We're safe here on the surface, since X- and gamma radiation can't travel far into the atmosphere; but the powerful burst of radiation can briefly interfere with high-frequency radio communications systems. The strongest effects are felt with a coronal mass ejection, or CME. These often – but not always – occur with solar flares. An expulsion of billions of tons of solar particles and tangled magnetic fields that blast through the Solar System, CMEs can take a few days to reach us, but when they do, the particles interact with Earth's magnetosphere to power a [geomagnetic storm](https://sciencealert.com/geomagnetic-storms), with several consequences. Electric currents generated high up in the atmosphere can result in power grid fluctuations, and voltage corrections may need to be applied, for example. There is increased drag on satellites, which can require course correction. Satellite communications and GPS can be disrupted. For a single CME, even one accompanying a powerful flare, the effects are unlikely to cause too many problems, but [we are likely to see auroras, down as far 50 degrees latitude](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation). Auroras are caused by solar particles slamming into Earth's magnetic field, and getting channeled and accelerated along magnetic field lines to high latitudes, where they are dumped out into the upper atmosphere. Their interactions with particles in the atmosphere result in ionization, which causes it to glow in colors that vary depending on the ratio of elements in the atmosphere. It's pretty much the same mechanism behind energizing neon in fluorescent lights, just on a much, much bigger scale. We were already on aurora alert from the X7.1 flare and CME that accompanied it. A [halo CME](https://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/halocmes.html) is one that is directed right at Earth; we're going to catch the brunt of it, and the [NOAA is forecasting several days of peak aurora conditions](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g3-strong-watches-effect-04-06-october-two-cmes-route). Some of the most powerful [geomagnetic storms](https://sciencealert.com/geomagnetic-storms) are the result of a [cannibal CME](https://www.sciencealert.com/cannibal-cme-is-about-to-deliver-spectacular-auroras-to-earths-atmosphere), where two CMEs are released in relatively quick succession, and the second overtakes and engulfs the first for a giant influx of solar particles. The two CMEs we're expecting now were released days apart, so we're probably not going to see that here. But conditions for aurora are strong, and will remain so [through the weekend](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/auroral-activity/aurora-forecast.html). It might be time to plan some skywatching to catch one of the most glorious shows our planet has to offer.",

I had a bigger purpose than anyone’s opinion.”\nO’Brien was Alabama’s offensive coordinator for two seasons from 2021-22. Milroe, a redshirt sophomore, said O’Brien told him there were “a bunch” of positions he could have switched to.\n“But look where I’m at right now,” Milroe added. “So who gets the last laugh?”\nAlabama QB Jalen Milroe says his former OC and current Patriots OC Bill O'Brien told him he should not be a quarterback.”How would you feel if I told you that you sucked?”\n“Look where I'm at right now. So who gets the last laugh?”pic.twitter.com/xurEAr61ge\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 28, 2023\nMilroe took over the starting quarterback reins this season after No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young departed for the NFL. The Katy, Texas, native was actually benched against South Florida in Week 3 following Alabama’s loss to Texas. But he re-entered the lineup the following week and hasn’t looked back since.\nThe 6-2, 220-pound signal-caller has tallied 2,718 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions with a 65.5 completion percentage this season. He’s also been a factor on the ground, rushing for 468 yards and 12 scores.\nMilroe has led Alabama to a perfect 10-0 record since his benching, most recently beating the undefeated two-time defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game to punch the Crimson Tide’s ticket to the CFP. His stellar season earned him a sixth-place finish in voting for the 2023 Heisman Trophy.\nMilroe and Co. will now look to take down another undefeated foe when they face No. 1 Michigan in the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day.\nThe 2023 College Football Playoff will feature Michigan, Alabama, Washington and Texas and will be the final year with a four-team format. Here is how the CFP works and what’s ahead for the 2024 season.",

    "text": "„Hat fast mein Leben ruiniert“ – Mutter testet umstrittene Erziehungsmethode\nSüßkartoffelklumpen statt Babybrei: Mein Kind „würgte so heftig, dass er sich übergab“, schreibt eine Mutter, die Baby Led Weaning ausprobiert hat.\nSäuglinge saugen, Babys mampfen Brei und Kleinkinder knabbern Kekse – oder? Nicht, wenn sich ihre Eltern für die „Baby Led Weaning“-Methode (BLW) entscheiden. Bei der wird der Brei übersprungen. Sobald der Zungenstreckreflex (feste Nahrung wird automatisch wieder aus dem Mund befördert) mit etwa sechs Monaten verschwunden ist, dürfen sie bereits gekochte Karottenschnitze oder Fleischstücke ansabbern.\nBei dieser „breifreien Beikosteinführung“ ernähren sich Babys immer noch hauptsächlich vom Stillen, betonen Befürworter der Fütter-Methode. Durch die feste Beikost, die sie nur angeboten, nie aufgezwungen bekommen, lernen sie bis zum Abstillen (mit etwa zwei Jahren) verschiedene Geschmäcker kennen und selbstbestimmt zu essen.\nAngeblich bewirke dies, dass die Kinder später mal nicht übergewichtig werden, behauptete 2008 die britische Krankenschwester Gill Rapley, die Erfinderin des Baby Led Weanings. All diese Vorteile sah auch die Atlantic-Redakteurin Olga Khazan und testet die Erziehungsmethode, die ähnlich umstritten ist wie die Kuss-Fütterung, bei ihrem sechs Monate alten Sohn. „Es hat fast mein Leben ruiniert“, schreibt sie danach.\nMutter testet Baby Led Weaning: Mein Sohn „würgte so heftig, dass er sich übergab“\n„Ich mischte Putenhackfleisch mit Süßkartoffeln und legte es meinem Sohn hin. Zögernd steckte er den Klumpen in den Mund. Innerhalb weniger Sekunden würgte er so heftig, dass er sich übergab“, schreibt Khazan. Dieses Würgen sei normal, sagen Baby-Wed-Leaning-Befürworter. Der Berufsverband der Kinder- und Jugendärzte hingegen befürchtet bei der Welt, dass sich Kinder verschlucken.\nEin Kinderernährungsexperte warnt Khazan, dass viel Würgen zu einer Aversion gegen jegliche Nahrung führen könne, egal ob vom Löffel oder als feste Beikost. Ihr Sohn habe immer wieder gewürgt, irgendwann kleine Bissen genommen und sie sofort wieder ausgespuckt. Mit fast einem Jahr, wo er eigentlich keine Säuglingsnahrung mehr brauchen müsste, habe er täglich nur 50 Kalorien feste Nahrung zu sich genommen. „Wir wussten nicht, was wir tun sollten“, schreibt die Journalistin.\nIm Internet stößt sie auf den Tipp, das Kind mit zerdrückter oder pürierter Nahrung (also Brei) zu füttern, wenn Baby Led Weaning nicht funktioniere. Auch eine Kinderärztin habe ihr das empfohlen. „Ich bekam das Gefühl, dass es weniger wissenschaftliche Belege gibt, als Befürworter behaupten.“ Der Ernährungspsychologe Thomas Ellrott bestätigt bei BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA: „Die wissenschaftliche Bewertung von möglichen Vor- und Nachteilen ist beim Baby Led Weaning noch nicht mit der nötigen Sicherheit möglich.“\nBaby Led Weaning: „Mein Baby ist nicht besonders schlau“\nKhazan spricht für ihren Text zu Baby Led Weaning mit einigen Experten und Expertinnen und stellt fest, dass es zwar für manche Babys gut ist, für manche aber auch das Füttern mit dem Löffel mehr Sinn ergibt. „Grundsätzlich sollte Baby Led Weaning funktionieren können, da unsere fernen Vorfahren wahrscheinlich nicht immer Breikost zur Verfügung stellen konnten“, sagt Ellrott BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nDoch das System und auch die Beratung in der Baby-Ernährung seien auf den „Übergang mit einer Breikost-Phase optimiert“, ergänzt der Ernährungspsychologe, der an der Georg-August-Universität Göttingen lehrt. „Das funktioniert in den meisten Fällen auch gut.“ Besonders bei Eltern wie Khazan, die feststellt, dass sie zu Hause eigentlich nie etwas koche, das ihr Baby auch essen dürfe: salzige und scharfe Soßen etwa, Salate mit Nüssen, Fertiggerichte und vieles mehr.\nSelbstbestimmtheit hin oder her: „Mein Baby ist nicht besonders schlau“, schreibt die Mutter. „Leider versteht es nicht instinktiv, wie man sich reich an verschiedenen Makronährstoffen ernährt, um die Säuglingsnahrung altersgerecht zu ergänzen.“ Das sei ihr Job und sie werde ihren Sohn dabei anleiten – wo nötig eben mit Babybrei.",

    "title": "Las hormonas sexuales son hormonas cerebrales y podrían ayudar a tratar el cerebro",
    "text": "Las hormonas sexuales son hormonas cerebrales y podrían ayudar a tratar el cerebro\nCuando los investigadores dieron nombre al estrógeno, estas eran las funciones que se le atribuían: inducir el frenesí y apoyar la salud sexual femenina.\nPor: Rachel E. Gross\nEl estrógeno es la Meryl Streep de las hormonas, y su versatilidad es famosa entre los científicos. Además de desempeñar un papel clave en la salud sexual y reproductiva, fortalece los huesos, mantiene la piel flexible, regula los niveles de azúcar, aumenta el flujo sanguíneo, reduce la inflamación y favorece el sistema nervioso central.\n“Nombra un órgano, y promueve la salud de ese órgano”, dijo Roberta Brinton, neurocientífica que dirige el Centro de Innovación en Ciencias Cerebrales de la Universidad de Arizona.\nPero el reconocimiento del papel más amplio del estrógeno ha tardado en llegar. El compuesto se identificó por primera vez en 1923 y a partir de entonces se conoció como la “hormona sexual femenina”, una reputación unidimensional inherente a su propio nombre.\n“Estrógeno” viene del griego “oestrus”, literalmente un tábano conocido por azotar al ganado en un frenesí enloquecido. Científicamente, el estro ha pasado a significar el periodo de los ciclos reproductivos de algunos mamíferos en el que las hembras son fértiles y sexualmente activas.\nLas mujeres no entran en estro; menstrúan. Sin embargo, cuando los investigadores dieron nombre al estrógeno, estas eran las funciones que se le atribuían: inducir el frenesí y apoyar la salud sexual femenina. Hoy en día, el estrógeno está ganando reconocimiento por lo que puede ser su papel más importante: influir en el cerebro.\nLos neurocientíficos han aprendido que el estrógeno es vital para el desarrollo sano del cerebro, pero que también contribuye a afecciones como la esclerosis múltiple y el alzhéimer. Los cambios en los niveles de estrógeno —procedentes del ciclo menstrual o de fuentes externas— pueden exacerbar las migrañas, las convulsiones y otros síntomas neurológicos comunes.\n“Hay un gran número de enfermedades neurológicas que pueden verse afectadas por las fluctuaciones de las hormonas sexuales”, dijo Hyman Schipper, neurólogo de la Universidad McGill, quien enumeró una decena de ellas en una reciente revisión de la revista Brain Medicine. “Y muchas de las terapias que se utilizan en medicina reproductiva deberían reutilizarse para estas enfermedades neurológicas”.\nEn la actualidad, la idea de que las hormonas sexuales son también hormonas cerebrales está transformando el modo en que los médicos abordan la salud y las enfermedades cerebrales, y los ayuda a orientar el tratamiento, evitar interacciones perjudiciales y desarrollar nuevas terapias basadas en hormonas.\nEl estrógeno, en aumento\nEn las mujeres, el estrógeno se fabrica principalmente en los ovarios, aunque también lo producen las glándulas suprarrenales y las células adiposas. En los hombres, el estrógeno se convierte a partir de la testosterona en los testículos y es crucial para la producción de esperma, la fuerza ósea, la función hepática, el metabolismo de las grasas y más.\nPero en ambos sexos, el cerebro también fabrica su propio estrógeno, lo que subraya su importancia neurológica. “El cerebro es en parte un órgano endocrino”, dijo Lisa Mosconi, neurocientífica que dirige la Iniciativa del Cerebro Femenino en Weill Cornell Medicine.\nEs rico en receptores de estrógeno, que se activan y desactivan a lo largo de la vida. Anteriormente se creía que estos se agrupaban en torno a estructuras con funciones reproductivas específicas, como la hipófisis y el hipotálamo. En realidad, “están por todas partes”, dijo Mosconi, quien desarrolló una técnica de exploración por PET (Tomografía por Emisión de Positrones, por su sigla en inglés) para ver estos receptores en un cerebro vivo. “Ni siquiera pudimos encontrar una región que estuviera completamente vacía”, dijo.\nEn el cerebro, el estrógeno puede unirse directamente a los receptores de las neuronas y otras células, desencadenando una cascada de acciones. También puede descomponerse en metabolitos, llamados neuroesteroides, que ejercen sus propios efectos de amplio alcance.\nAlgunos de estos neuroesteroides ya se han convertido en terapias propias: la alopregnanolona, un metabolito de la progesterona, es la base de un fármaco utilizado para tratar ciertos tipos de epilepsia. El mismo metabolito se encuentra en un ensayo clínico como posible terapia regenerativa para la enfermedad de Alzheimer.\nEn el útero, el estrógeno de la madre ayuda a organizar los circuitos neuronales del embrión, dirige la producción de células cerebrales e influye en el crecimiento de las distintas regiones del cerebro. Durante transiciones importantes como la pubertad, el embarazo y la menopausia, el estrógeno ayuda a podar y reconfigurar el cerebro una vez más.\nPero ahora los investigadores saben que el estrógeno da forma al cerebro en todas las etapas de la vida. Puede modular el disparo de las neuronas, reducir la inflamación, aumentar la neuroplasticidad, ayudar a convertir la glucosa en energía, impedir la acumulación de placa y mejorar el flujo sanguíneo en el cerebro.\nNo todos estos efectos son positivos. Schipper ha descubierto que, en roedores, el uso prolongado de estrógenos puede envejecer ciertas partes del cerebro. “Ninguna de estas hormonas hace solo una cosa”, dijo.\nEl embarazo y el cerebro\nEn el pasado, los neurocientíficos sabían que los estrógenos tenían efectos más allá del sistema reproductor. Pero optaron por no estudiarlos: antes de 2016, por lo general excluían a las hembras de los experimentos, para evitar tener que lidiar con las diferencias de comportamiento y fisiología asociadas a los ciclos hormonales.\n“¿Cómo vas a saber si los estrógenos son neuroprotectores si ni siquiera haces experimentos con hembras?”, dijo Rhonda Voskuhl, neuróloga del Programa Integral de Menopausia de la Universidad de California en Los Ángeles. “Por favor”.\nEn 1998, Voskuhl buscaba una molécula que protegiera al cerebro de los efectos de la esclerosis múltiple, en la que el sistema inmunitario ataca a las células nerviosas, despojándolas de su capa protectora. La EM afecta a cerca de un millón de estadounidenses, la mayoría mujeres.\nYa existían fármacos que reducían la inflamación y ayudaban a prevenir la destrucción de los nervios. Pero solo servían hasta cierto punto. “Hay que añadir algo que se dirija directamente al cerebro”, dijo Voskuhl.\nSu búsqueda empezó con una observación clínica: se sabía que el embarazo protegía a las mujeres contra los síntomas de la EM. Durante el tercer trimestre, las tasas de recaída descienden en un 70 por ciento; el embarazo, al parecer, es al menos tan eficaz como los mejores medicamentos. Pero esta protección es temporal. Después del parto, el riesgo de recaída aumenta bruscamente.\nVoskuhl sabía que el sistema inmunitario se calma durante el embarazo, presumiblemente para proteger el delicado injerto semi-ajeno que es el embrión. Pero sospechaba que había algo más. “Tiene sentido que la madre tenga algo que no solo sea antiinflamatorio, sino también neuroprotector”, dijo.\nEsa sustancia resultó ser el estriol, una forma de estrógeno producida principalmente por la placenta. En 2016, en un ensayo clínico aleatorizado de 164 mujeres, Voskuhl mostró que el tratamiento con estriol administrado durante dos años reducía significativamente las recaídas de la EM. También parecía mejorar la cognición y reducir la atrofia de la materia gris.\nSe sabía que el estriol era seguro: las pacientes menopáusicas de Europa llevan décadas utilizándolo. Y a diferencia del estradiol, no se une fuertemente a los receptores mamarios, lo que significa que no conlleva el mismo riesgo de cáncer de mama a largo plazo. Voskuhl dijo que potencialmente incluso podría utilizarse en los hombres. “Es un regalo para los científicos”, añadió.\nVoskuhl estudia ahora si el hallazgo es válido no solo para las pacientes de EM, sino para todas las mujeres en la menopausia. Ha desarrollado una terapia hormonal patentada, PearlPAK, que contiene estriol y que vende la empresa CleopatraRX, de la que es asesora médica.\nEl sitio web afirma que PearlPAK puede resolver “los problemas de memoria y salud cognitiva causados por la menopausia”. Pero esa es la hipótesis que Voskuhl intenta probar, al monitorear anualmente a las mujeres que toman PearlPAK con pruebas cognitivas. Dijo que la necesidad era demasiado urgente como para que las mujeres esperaran al improbable caso de que los NIH (Institutos Nacionales de la Salud, por su sigla en inglés) o una empresa farmacéutica financiaran un ensayo clínico aleatorizado. “Simplemente estoy tomando el método que utilizamos en la EM y tratando de aplicarlo a la menopausia”, dijo.\nUn legado tenso\nNo sería la primera vez que se sugiere la terapia estrogénica como cura cognitiva para las mujeres menopáusicas. “Antes del año 2000, parecía que el estrógeno era la panacea”, dijo Schipper.\nEn aquella época, se pensaba que la hormona protegía el cerebro envejecido contra el ictus y el alzhéimer, una idea respaldada por numerosos estudios en animales y unos pocos estudios observacionales en humanos.\nLa situación cambió en 2003. El Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (Estudio de la Memoria de la Iniciativa para la Salud de la Mujer), un ensayo clínico histórico de seguimiento de los efectos a largo plazo de la terapia hormonal en mujeres posmenopáusicas, descubrió que las mujeres mayores del estudio que tomaban estrógenos —a diferencia de estrógeno más progesterona— tenían el doble de riesgo de demencia en comparación con las que tomaban un placebo.\nLos médicos dejaron de recetar estrógenos a las mujeres posmenopáusicas, y las mujeres dejaron de tomarlos por miedo. La actitud de muchos científicos fue: “¿Para qué estudiarlo? Ya nadie va a tomar estrógenos, así que no tiene sentido”, dijo Margaret McCarthy, neurocientífica de la Universidad de Maryland. “Fue terrible para la investigación”.\nMás tarde quedó claro que este hallazgo solo era válido para las mujeres que empezaban la terapia estrogénica a los 65 años o más, al menos 10 años después de su último periodo menstrual. En el caso de las mujeres de 50 a 55 años, según un metaanálisis, el efecto de los estrógenos sobre el riesgo de demencia era neutro. Las mujeres más jóvenes no se incluyeron en la Iniciativa para la Salud de la Mujer (WHI, por su sigla en inglés).\n“El momento oportuno lo es todo”, dijo JoAnn Manson, investigadora de la WHI y neuroendocrinóloga del Hospital Brigham and Women’s, quien dirigió el metaanálisis. “Cada vez hay más evidencia de que existe un período crítico de exposición al estrógeno para obtener beneficios cognitivos”.\nAhora los investigadores tenían que ir más allá de la idea de que el estrógeno era neuroprotector y plantearse una pregunta más matizada: ¿Exactamente cuándo y cómo protege esta hormona al cerebro?\nCentrarse en los orígenes del alzhéimer\nEn ninguna parte es más evidente el papel del estrógeno en la salud cerebral que en la menopausia, cuando su retirada puede contribuir a los síntomas cognitivos que las mujeres de mediana edad conocen y odian: bochornos, sueño interrumpido, niebla cerebral. La pérdida de estrógenos es una de las razones principales, según algunos neurocientíficos, de que el alzhéimer afecte al doble de mujeres que de hombres.\nA medida que disminuyen los niveles de estrógeno, cambia el metabolismo del cerebro. Hasta la menopausia, el cerebro funciona en gran medida con glucosa, que el estrógeno ayuda a convertir en energía. En la menopausia, el cerebro empieza a depender de combustibles alternativos, incluida su propia materia blanca, según ha descubierto Brinton en estudios con animales.\n“Es una respuesta de inanición”, dijo. “No tiene nada que ver con la capacidad reproductiva, sino con un estado de transición del cerebro”.\nEste cambio podría marcar el momento en que comienza la vulnerabilidad al alzhéimer y, en teoría, el momento en que la terapia estrogénica u otra intervención podría ayudar a prevenir el deterioro cognitivo. Pero Brinton no tenía forma de verlo en un cerebro humano. En 2014, pidió ayuda a Mosconi, experta en neuroimagen.\nEn aquel momento, los médicos solo podían medir los niveles de estrógeno en la sangre. Pero Mosconi se dio cuenta de que millones de estadounidenses seguían algún tipo de terapia basada en estrógenos y nadie sabía lo que este hacía en sus cerebros. “Es ridículo”, dijo. Así que desarrolló una técnica de imagen para ver los receptores de estrógeno en el cerebro, reutilizando un trazador empleado para detectar esos mismos receptores en el cáncer de mama.\nEn 2024, ella y Brinton se sorprendieron al saber que, tras la menopausia, el número de receptores de estrógeno en el cerebro parecía aumentar drásticamente, quizá en un intento de captar más cantidad de esta hormona. Pero, curiosamente, cuantos más receptores de estrógenos tenía una mujer, peores eran sus resultados cognitivos y de memoria.\nEn febrero, Mosconi inició un programa de investigación de 50 millones de dólares financiado por Wellcome Leap, denominado Reducir el riesgo de alzhéimer mediante la endocrinología. Espera identificar qué mujeres corren mayor riesgo de padecer alzhéimer debido a los cambios cerebrales relacionados con el estrógeno, y averiguar si la terapia hormonal administrada durante un periodo crítico podría ayudar a reducir su riesgo.\nLa respuesta puede no ser tan sencilla como averiguar cuándo ponerse un parche de estrógeno. “Hay todo un sistema que debe comprenderse mejor antes de manipularlo”, advirtió.\nRellenar un punto ciego neurológico\nA medida que los investigadores adquieren una comprensión más matizada de cómo afectan las hormonas sexuales al cerebro, a algunos médicos les preocupa que los conocimientos tarden demasiado en llegar a las clínicas. “Afecta significativamente mi consulta”, dijo Schipper. “Debería afectar la consulta de todos los neurólogos”.\nPor ejemplo, Schipper podría tratar a una paciente con epilepsia relacionada con la menstruación aumentando su medicación contra la epilepsia durante la fase lútea tardía de su periodo, cuando los niveles elevados de estrógeno aumentan la probabilidad de convulsiones.\nTambién dijo que evitaría recetarle Dilantin, un anticonvulsivo común. Muchos neurólogos ignoran que el Dilantin acelera el metabolismo del hígado, haciendo que descomponga las hormonas anticonceptivas; aunque la paciente tome anticonceptivos, podría quedarse embarazada accidentalmente. “Nunca se les pasa por la cabeza”, dijo Schipper.\nDel mismo modo, Jelena Pavlovic, neuróloga de la Facultad de Medicina Albert Einstein de Nueva York, descubrió que las mujeres con migrañas relacionadas con la menstruación son más vulnerables a los dolores de cabeza justo después de desprenderse el revestimiento uterino, cuando los niveles de estrógeno descienden bruscamente. Comprender ese vínculo le permite administrar un tratamiento preventivo cuando sea más eficaz.\n“Realmente necesitamos integrar los problemas de salud de la mujer en la neurología”, dijo Pavlovic, quien es una de las pocas neurólogas especializadas en trastornos de cefalea y hormonas sexuales.\nVoshkul, cuyo trabajo abarca también la ginecología y la neurología, se mostró de acuerdo. Cuando los médicos que tratan el cerebro no comparten conocimientos con los que se ocupan de las hormonas, y viceversa, dijo, los pacientes sufren.\n“Las respuestas están ahí”, dijo. “Si hablan entre ellos, las respuestas están ahí”.",
