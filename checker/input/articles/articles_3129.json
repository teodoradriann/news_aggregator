    "text": "Editor’s note:\nWander Franco was placed on administrative leave by MLB on August 22nd.\nThe\nTampa Bay Rays and star shortstop Wander Franco have mutually agreed he will go on the restricted list and not be with the club during their current road trip, the team announced Monday.\nThe development comes after the Rays’ statement to multiple outlets Sunday night that\nMLB is looking into social media posts regarding Franco, saying that the team is in “close contact” with the league as it conducts its “due diligence.”\nAdvertisement\nThe Rays did not specify the nature of the social media content in their statement.

I’m not going to comment any further on that,” Cash told reporters. “But the day off was because (it’s) a day off.”\nFranco, in his third year with Tampa Bay, earned his first All-Star nod this season. He started each of the Rays’ past 20 games prior to Sunday.

    "text": "Living\nWhy Commuters Are ‘Barebacking’ Their Train Rides-and Freaking Everyone Out\nThey're calling it \"barebacking,\" and no, it's not what you think. This new trend has nothing to do with dating apps and everything to do with the daily grind.\nAs return-to-office mandates ramp back up, a growing number of commuters are ditching their phones, books, and laptops during their train or bus rides. Instead, they're just… staring. Out the window. Into space. Occasionally into the eyes of fellow passengers, much to their discomfort.\nThis unnerving behavior has a name thanks to talent manager and podcaster Curtis Morton, who recently went viral for calling out so-called \"barebackers\" who zone out during commutes. But\nFortune reports that experts say this idle behavior might not be laziness-or even boredom. It's rebellion.\nCareer coaches and psychotherapists alike are framing this screen-free silence as a conscious way for workers to reclaim their time. \"It's a pushback against the erosion of boundaries,\" says career coach Amanda Augustine. Instead of jumping into emails before their first sip of coffee, employees are creating mental buffers between their personal and professional lives. It's less defiance, more survival.\nRelated: Returning to Office Comes at a Much Higher Cost Post-Pandemic\nAnd science is on their side. Staring out the window isn't just oddly meditative-it reduces stress, fights screen fatigue, and boosts productivity through diffuse-mode thinking, the kind of creative processing that happens when your brain is at rest.\nStill, not everyone's a fan. The awkward eye contact and eerie silence make for a tense ride. But according to experts, that moment of nothingness may be exactly what our brains need to fire on all cylinders later.\nSo the next time someone on your train seems to be zoning out, maybe give them a break. They might just be doing some of their best work-with their eyes closed.\n2025 The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. All rights reserved.\nThis story was originally published April 30, 2025 at 8:36 PM.",

    "text": "As Prince Edward Island braces for an early spring storm, residents are advised to prepare for a tumultuous weekend. Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Prince County, forecasting significant snowfall followed by freezing rain and ice pellets, starting Saturday afternoon and extending into Sunday. CBC meteorologist Tina Simpkin has emphasized the severe weather conditions, highlighting strong winds with gusts up to 70 km/h and a substantial amount of precipitation anticipated across the island.\nAdvertisment Preparation and Response Measures In anticipation of adverse weather conditions, various safety measures and advisories have been issued. The Confederation Bridge has warned of potential traffic restrictions due to strong winds, while Maritime Electric has mobilized its crews to address any power outages, urging residents to prepare emergency kits. With snow accumulations of 15 to 25 centimeters expected in Prince County and 5 to 15 centimeters elsewhere before the transition to rain, the risk of freezing rain and ice pellets presents additional hazards for the island's residents and visitors.\nTravel Warnings and Safety Advisories Advertisment Travel during the weekend is strongly discouraged, with Simpkin warning of potential record-breaking snowfalls in New Brunswick and challenging conditions across P.E.I. The exact demarcation line between rain and snow remains uncertain, but Prince County is anticipated to bear the brunt of the snowfall. Residents and travelers are advised to stay updated on the latest weather forecasts and to exercise caution, particularly during the expected peak of the storm Saturday night into Sunday morning.\nCommunity and Governmental Response Local authorities and utility companies are on high alert, ready to respond to the impact of the storm. Environment Canada continues to monitor the evolving situation, providing updates to ensure public safety. The community is urged to follow advisories, prepare for potential power outages, and limit travel during the storm's peak. This event underscores the importance of emergency preparedness and the collective efforts of governmental agencies, utility providers, and residents in mitigating the storm's impact.\nThis early spring storm serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of weather and the importance of community readiness. As P.E.I. faces this challenging weekend, the resilience and preparedness of its residents and the responsiveness of local services will be crucial in navigating the storm's effects. With ongoing updates and advisories, the island prepares to weather the storm, hopeful for a swift return to calmer days.",

    "text": "6 minutes ago • 1 min\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat’s going on here?\nSouth Africa’s state-owned logistics giant, Transnet, is bracing for a clash with the United National Transport Union (UNTU) after its three-year wage proposal was rejected.\nWhat does this mean?\nTransnet reached an agreement with the South African Transport and Allied Workers' Union (SATAWU) for a wage increase of 6% for two years and 5.5% for the third year. But UNTU, which represents more than half of Transnet's workforce, isn’t satisfied. They’re organizing their 25,000 members to campaign for a 10% raise and a single-year deal. UNTU claims the proposal falls short of a 'liveable, just, and fair agreement.' Transnet, however, defends its offer as equitable given their financial and operational challenges.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Labor disputes on the horizon.\nIf UNTU’s strike action proceeds, it might disrupt Transnet’s operations, impacting logistics and supply chains. Investors should monitor how this affects sectors dependent on Transnet, potentially harming those targeted and influencing the broader logistics industry.\nThe bigger picture: Wage wrangles and financial stability.\nSouth Africa’s economic stability could face challenges if negotiations break down, leading to costly disruptions. With Transnet already facing financial and operational hurdles, a strike could have wider implications, potentially shaking investor confidence given Transnet's critical role in the supply chain.\nBrits, you need to know your way around a Stocks and Shares ISA.\nYou can use the accounts to invest in a variety of assets at varying risk levels – and most importantly, you won’t pay UK taxon any interest or gains.\nThat means your money can work harder: by keeping more cash in your account rather than the taxman’s, you’ll benefit from more compounding power, putting you closer to your goals.\nBut with so many providers out there, you’ll be hard-pressed to find clarity about which one offers the best value, investment choices, and service for you.\nKepler Trust Intelligence has done the hard work for you, ranking the top ISA providers for 2025 based on performance, fees, and customer satisfaction.\nSo to put ISA providers head-to-head, like you might with a new phone or a credit card comparison, you can take a look at Kepler’s ranking of the best ISA providers this year.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

    "title": "Michael Keaton Admits He ‘Sucked’ in ‘Dumbo’",
    "text": "Michael Keaton recently admitted that he felt his performance in Tim Burton’s Dumbo was lacking. The 72-year-old actor portrayed the villainous V.A. Vandevere in the 2019 live-action remake of the classic Disney film. He revealed his disappointment in an interview with The New York Times , saying, “I think I let him down on one movie, but that’s just me, and it bugs me to this day.” He added, “I was clueless on Dumbo . I sucked in Dumbo .”\nTim Burton responded nonchalantly, saying, “I don’t even know what you’re talking about. But whatever.”\nKeaton and Burton have reunited for the upcoming Beetlejuice Beetlejuice , a sequel to their 1988 comedy classic. Keaton reprises his role as the titular foul-mouthed ghost, and Burton aimed to evolve the story and universe while keeping the character true to his politically incorrect roots.\nIn an interview with Collider, Burton shared, “I think Michael and I both love the fact that he was politically incorrect then, and he’s politically incorrect now. I’m just laughing because somebody asked him the other day, ‘Michael, how does Beetlejuice’s character evolve?’ And we just started laughing because he doesn’t evolve — that’s the whole point!”\nKeaton, who stars alongside Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega, Monica Bellucci, and Willem Dafoe in the sequel, mentioned that the new film would include some “big swings.” However, he noted that the cast and crew had to be “a tiny, tiny, tiny bit more politically correct” this time around.\nHe explained, “There was a lot of [big swings] in the first one. It was like one gigantic big swing. Less so now because we knew we could get away with more.” He continued, “It’s weird, we had to be a tiny, tiny, tiny bit more politically correct, but we didn’t even think about that too much. A couple of times, we went, ‘Yeah, maybe not,’ and then we went right up to it.”\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice is set to open in theaters on September 5.\nSource: The New York Times , Collider",

    "text": "Xubilacións, Risga, subsidio de desemprego [, ingreso mínimo vital, ](https://galego.farodevigo.es/tags/desempleo/) [pensións](https://galego.farodevigo.es/tags/pensiones/) por algún tipo de incapacidade [laboral](https://galego.farodevigo.es/tags/laboral/)... As prestacións públicas constitúen a única vía de ingreso para 890.625 galegos, unha cifra que baixou da fronteira dos 900.000 e retrocedeu un 3,3% o ano pasado respecto de 2021. A análise dos datos revela que a mellora do [emprego](https://galego.farodevigo.es/tags/empleo/) na comunidade permitiu a 44.345 cidadáns deixar de depender dos subsidios para chegar a fin mes na franxa de idade dos 16 aos 64 anos, excluíndo, por tanto, ás persoas en idade de xubilación. A Enquisa estrutural a fogares elaborada polo Instituto Galego de Estatística ( [IGE](https://galego.farodevigo.es/tags/instituto-galego-de-estadistica/)) revela unha contracción da dependencia das axudas ou cheques procedentes do erario público en 2022, grazas en maior medida ao incremento das cifras de emprego. Nese ano, a cifra de cidadáns galegos cun posto de traballo creceu en 18.600 persoas, de acordo coa Enquisa de Poboación Activa do Instituto Nacional de Estatística. Ademais, rebaixáronse os ERTE’s que se mantiveron parte de 2021 como resaca da pandemia de COVID-19 xurdida un ano antes e que causou un terremoto socioeconómico. Galicia conta con 890.625 persoas que reciben ingresos económicos procedentes de prestacións, unha cifra que entre os 16 e os 64 anos sitúase en 271.707, 44.345 menos que en 2021. O envellecemento permite engordar lixeiramente o dato a partir dos 65 anos, idade de retiro tradicional, aínda que en 2011 endurecéronse os requisitos para colgar o mono de traballo nese momento. O IGE mostra unha radiografía por tramos de idade de quen subsiste grazas ás prestacións públicas. Entre os 16 e os 29 anos, a porcentaxe redúcese do 7,6% ao 5,8% (de 24.368 a 18.865); entre os 30 e os 39, o descenso é do 15% ao 12% (de 110.406 a 89.929); entre os 50 e os 59, a porcentaxe dá un salto e cae do 23,1% ao 20,4% (de 95.384 a 85.416); mentres que dos 60 aos 64, a caída é máis pronunciada; do 45,3% (85.894) ao 40,5% (77.497). A partir da idade de retiro, as cifras dispáranse, loxicamente, pero mantéñense estables respecto de 2021. Dos 65 aos 69 anos, a porcentaxe é case idéntico: 81,89% (138.221 galegos) fronte a 81,36% (139.356) o ano pasado; entre os 70 e os 74, o 88,3% (135.592) redúcese ao 87,9% (136.906); e partir dos 75, o dato crece do 92,1% (334.683) ao 93,5% (342.656). Estas cifras trasládanse tamén ao ámbito dos fogares. Os 343.593 que dependían de prestacións en 2021 redúcense ata os 332.925, pasando dun 32% do total a un 30,94%. Taxa de pobreza: 14,5% O IGE tamén revela que a taxa de pobreza na comunidade caeu á menor porcentaxe en 12 anos, cun 14,54% dos fogares fronte ao 15,1% do ano anterior. Parte desta caída débese á citada mellora do emprego, co engadido do incremento do salario mínimo. De feito, o ingreso medio mensual dos fogares galegos creceu un 5,46% en 2022 ata os 2.548 euros. As catro provincias rexistraron un aumento desta contía, sendo Lugo a que experimentou un mellor comportamento cun 6,92% máis ata os 2.564 euros. Na Coruña, esta cifra foi de 2.631 euros, cun 4,95% de aumento. Pola súa banda, Ourense contabilizou uns ingresos medios por fogar de 2.249 euros, un 2,65% máis, mentres que en Pontevedra a alza alcanzou o 6,57%, ata 2.545 euros.",

    "title": "Planos de saúde alegam prejuízos para se livrar de idosos e crianças autistas",
    "text": "No mês passado, pais de crianças autistas começaram a receber um aviso inesperado. Por e-mail, a administradora Qualicorp informava que seus planos de saúde Amil seriam cancelados. A empresa alegou que os contratos estariam “gerando prejuízo” à operadora. Por isso, seriam encerrados unilateralmente, mesmo com as mensalidades em dia.\nO drama das famílias atípicas chegou à imprensa. Em pouco tempo, soube-se que o problema era maior — e envolvia outras gigantes do setor. Idosos, portadores de doenças raras e pacientes com câncer também entraram na mira das rescisões em massa. Passaram a ser vistos como clientes indesejáveis, a serem varridos das carteiras de seguros.\nEm anúncio publicado nos maiores jornais do país, a Amil disse agir “dentro da mais absoluta legalidade”. A operadora afirmou que “lamenta os transtornos causados” e descreveu o cancelamento como uma medida “difícil”. Se é difícil para ela, imagine para as famílias que ficaram desprotegidas no momento em que mais precisavam do plano.\nNum mercado acostumado a fazer o que bem entende, a rescisão unilateral virou epidemia. As queixas à Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar (ANS) subiram 99%. A Secretaria Nacional do Consumidor notificou os planos e definiu a situação como “inaceitável”. Na Câmara, arma-se uma CPI para investigar as empresas e a atuação da agência reguladora.\n“A ANS é uma vergonha. Entre a operadora e o cliente, sempre escolhe o lado da operadora”, critica a médica e professora Ligia Bahia, da UFRJ. Ela define a rescisão como uma prática “perversa”. “O cliente interessa quando está saudável e deixa de interessar quando está doente”, resume.\nNa quinta-feira, a Associação Brasileira de Planos de Saúde (Abramge) se defendeu nos jornais. Em carta aberta, afirmou que as operadoras “têm enfrentado um quadro desafiador, especialmente com a proliferação de fraudes”. O texto tem 200 palavras, mas evita os termos “rescisão” e “cancelamento”. “O que se deseja é a ampliação do acesso à saúde suplementar, com cada vez mais qualidade e segurança”, conclui. Faltou explicar como ampliar o acesso à saúde negando direitos aos segurados.\nFraudes são caso de polícia, e cabe aos planos denunciar quem age de má-fé. Ao citá-las de forma genérica, as empresas tentam desviar o foco e ofendem famílias que apenas lutam por atendimento. “Estão expulsando as crianças, e não as clínicas fraudadoras. Ou estão insinuando que os pais ganham com reembolsos fraudulentos?”, questiona Ligia Bahia.\n“Se a família é obrigada a interromper as terapias, a criança corre o risco de regredir. Os relatos que estamos recebendo são de partir o coração”, desabafa a psicopedagoga Viviani Guimarães, do Movimento Orgulho Autista Brasil (Moab). Na quarta, a entidade obteve uma liminar que proibiu a Amil e a administradora Allcare de cancelar contratos de famílias atípicas no Distrito Federal. A Amil afirmou que “cumprirá integralmente” a decisão.\nNa véspera, Viviane se chocou com o tom das empresas em audiência na Câmara.
