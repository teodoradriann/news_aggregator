    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "【大纪元2025年05月08日讯】（大纪元记者李平多伦多报导）最近，禽流感病毒H5N1全美肆虐，成百上千万只鸟类受感染H5N1禽流感病毒。更糟的是，H5N1禽流感病毒还跨物种传播，感染牛、猫和狗等哺乳动物。此外，还有其它毒株在传播。\n2月份春季来临，数以百万计的候鸟北上飞往加拿大。安省鸟类研究员卡姆·谢瓦利耶（Cam Chevalier）透露，安省西南部埃塞克斯县（Essex County）位于两条主要候鸟迁徙路线的交汇处。\n谢瓦利耶的主管、温大鸟类学家丹·门尼尔（Dan Mennill）表示，这个地方是一个热点区，有助于了解哪些鸟类迁入当地？是否携带病毒？是否会将病毒传播到当地水道中。许多候鸟穿越伊利湖后，会在埃塞克斯县停留，然后再飞往安省北部、魁省和曼省等其它地区。\n谢瓦利耶会从伊利湖北岸多个候鸟停留点采集样本，记录当天看到的鸟类种类，然后将装满贴好标签的样本箱送到温莎大学（UFW），温莎大学的研究人员再研究样本是否携带H5N1病毒。\n门尼尔表示，研究目的是研究野生鸟类（例如加拿大鹅或绿头鸭）如何传播禽流感，以便随时做好准备，预防禽流感对人类健康构成严重威胁。为此，必须提前了解哪些鸟类是禽流感病毒传播的主要媒介，了解病毒在野生鸟类中的传播、在野生鸟类和家禽之间的传播，等。\n温大化学教授肯尼斯·吴（Kenneth Ng）透露，他的研究团队不仅研究水样中的病毒，还密切追踪病毒结构变化。研究人员更担心病毒变异后会更易感染人类，最后发展到人际传播。\n目前美国已有70人感染禽流感病毒，加拿大仅报告一例。目前尚无禽流感人际传播报导。但最近发表在同行评议期刊《科学》上的一项研究表明，在美国奶牛中传播的H5N1毒株，距离人传人仅一步之遥。\n责任编辑：文芳",

    "text": "Zooms should be used for artistic purposes, not for utility. If your subject is not in frame or in focus, then you set your scene up badly. Zooms look weird and unnatural, which works great when used artistically, but when not it just looks like the director and camera people hosed up and are making rapid corrections.\nWhat really upsets me is that mostly this hasn't been an issue, until around the time The Office became popular. The Office was a documentary-style show, and to capture that aesthetic, much of the camera work is \"bad\" because it's supposed to be unexpected, as though shot by camera men in the area who did not know what was going to happen. But other shows have taken this style and just run with it, made it formulaic even after the \"documentary\" style has been removed. TMZ is a weird example, and probably not one anyone here watches, but I was in jail and so I had to watch a lot of it because inmates fuckin love TMZ. In a TMZ scene, every single shot, every single shot is \"cut to different camera, wait one second, quickly zoom in on subject\", and then on to a different camera, wait one second, zoom. Different camera, wait one second, zoom. It's loving awful. Brooklyn Nine-Nine does this, too, though it's not quite as egregious and while I think they do it to try and capture the \"unexpectedness\" of the show, it isn't a documentary and so this just looks like bad camera work . Movies now do this, lots of shows do it. It's loving terrible. We've gone from \"the camera is shaky all the time because we're right in the action \" to \"the shot is terribly set up and poorly edited because we're right in the action \"",

    "title": "Flt Lt ‘Rusty’ Waughman, Lancaster pilot who survived the most dangerous raids of the war – obituary",
    "text": "Flight Lieutenant ‘Rusty’ Waughman, who has died aged 100, completed a tour of operations as the pilot of a Lancaster bomber on a squadron that suffered some of the highest casualties of the Second World War.\nIn 1943 Waughman and his crew joined 101 Squadron, which operated Lancasters equipped with a special apparatus that searched out and then jammed enemy radio transmissions. To transmit spurious messages to German night-fighter pilots, a specially trained German-speaking operator accompanied the crew. The Lancasters’ transmissions, however, allowed German night fighters to intercept the bombers, and the attrition rate on 101 Squadron was one of the highest in Bomber Command.\nOn the night of March 30/31 1944, Waughman’s crew joined 794 other bombers to attack Nuremberg. On a cloudless night, the German night fighters caused havoc with the bomber stream and Bomber Command suffered its biggest loss of the war, with 95 bombers failing to return. Waughman described the sight of falling bombers as “spectacular and very frightening”.\nTwo weeks later, on April 10/11 1944, Waughman’s crew were sent to bomb the railway system at Hasselt in Belgium. Nearing the target, another Lancaster collided with their aircraft, causing extensive damage. Waughman managed to maintain control, bombed the target and returned to make a crash landing. The other Lancaster fell away and crashed.\n'Rusty' Waughman During the next few weeks, Bomber Command flew many sorties in preparation for the impending Normandy invasion, targeting transportations systems and storage areas, notably the large German military camp and armament storage area near the French village at Mailly-le-Camp, which was attacked on the night of May 3/4. Due to radio problems, orders from the Master Bomber were confusing and the 346 Lancasters had to orbit the target, which gave German night fighters time to attack.\nSeconds after bombing the target, another bomber flew below Waughman’s Lancaster and then exploded, throwing their aircraft on to its back. It plummeted to 1,000 feet and exceeded the maximum permitted speed for the Lancaster, but Waughman managed to execute what he called “a very poor barrel roll”, with the help of the flight engineer, and right the aircraft without stalling. The wireless operator, finding his head covered in warm, wet liquid, said “Blood! Blood!” but it was only the contents of the up-ended “pee can”.\nThe raid was a success, but 42 bombers were lost, almost 12 per cent of the force sent out on the mission.\nThe son of a Royal Navy seaman decorated in the First World War, Russell ‘Rusty’ Reay Waughman was born on January 19 1923 at Shotley Bridge, Co Durham, and educated in Newcastle. In May 1941 he joined the RAF and trained in Canada as a pilot as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. On his return to England he converted to bombers.\nAt the bomber training unit he formed a crew drawn from different backgrounds and from across the UK, with a rear gunner from Canada, but “we all gelled”. The oldest was 26; Waughman, at 20, was the second oldest. His navigator was only 18, having “adjusted” his date of birth when joining the RAF. In later life, Waughman spoke of the comradeship of this “band of brothers”. Five of them met regularly in later life, and gathered for their respective 80th birthdays.\nThe King signing a picture of a Lancaster with Rusty Waughman, July 2023 Credit : Arthur Edwards/The Sun Waughman and his crew performed well on the Lancaster and were sent to join 101 Squadron at Ludford Magna near Lincoln in October 1943. Their arrival coincided with the beginning of the second phase of the Battle of Berlin. They visited the “Big City” several times and carried out other long-range bombing operations.\nOver Munich, their Lancaster was damaged, and they had to return without an air speed indicator, landing after almost 10 hours in the air; finding themselves flying over France in daylight, they saw “two little specks” coming towards them, but they turned out to be Spitfires sent to escort them home.\nThen, on a raid over Stettin, Waughman’s Lancaster was hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the crew limped back to base on two and a half engines. They arrived so late that they were assumed missing: “the committee of adjustment had been in and started to take our kit away,” he recalled.\nHis final sortie was on the night of D-Day, June 5/6 1944. The squadron launched 21 Lancasters to jam wireless communications and prevent enemy night fighters from being directed against the airborne invasion forces.\nMembers of another air crew of 101 Squadron, January 1944 Credit : Popperfoto Waughman and his crew had flown 30 operations and were the first in six months to complete a tour, such had been the casualty rates on the squadron. He was awarded the DFC. He always regretted that none of his crew were decorated. “They kept us all alive, they were doing exactly the same job as I was doing, under the same circumstances,” he said. “Same risks, but nothing.”\nIn later life, Waughman spoke frankly about the first time he felt terror – a “most peculiar” experience – on an operation to the Ruhr, “the old Happy Valley” as they called it. “We were approaching the area and it really looked deadly... The flak was so thick you could get out and walk on it... Searchlights, fighters around,” he recalled.\n“I literally was shaking, and I couldn’t do what I was supposed to do, so I dropped my seat so I couldn’t see outside and, funnily enough, I said a little prayer that I hadn’t said since I was about six years old. Why I said it I don’t know [but] the terror disappeared and I raised my seat, and I could just carry on. You’re still frightened, of course, but all the terror disappeared.”\nAfter completing his time on 101 Squadron, he became a flying instructor before converting to the Dakota. He continued instructing and in February 1947 was sent to Oakington, near Cambridge, where he became the station’s flying training officer for four Dakota squadrons. With the beginning of the Berlin Airlift, he flew training and crew standardisation sorties, on some occasions spending 10 hours in the air. He later took part in the airlift, flying many re-supply missions from the forward RAF airfield at Fassberg in West Germany. He was awarded the AFC.\nRusty Waughman on the 80th anniversary of Operation Chastise, at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire Credit : Arthur Edwards/The Sun After the airlift, Waughman was posted to Abingdon to join 30 Squadron to become the squadron’s training officer. The squadron had a VIP flying role and it was Waughman’s task to check all the pilots on instrument flying.\nWhen his young wife Pat was diagnosed with a terminal illness he resigned from the RAF in 1953 to take care of her until her death 10 months later. He spent the next 27 years in sales and marketing for a packing company.\nIn 1990 five of his crew met at Ludford Magna before travelling to RAF Coningsby as guests of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, where they were re-united with the Lancaster. Earlier this year he returned to Coningsby, where he met the King at a reunion for Bomber Command veterans. The French government appointed him to Légion d’honneur and he was a strong supporter of the Royal Air Force Association in Leamington.\nHe was also a silversmith, and micro-mounted gem stones onto jewellery.\nWaughman’s second wife Diana died in 2007. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.\n‘Rusty’ Waughman, born January 19 1923, died December 14 2023\nSearch for related Related Topics Battle of Britain, Berlin, Munich, Royal Air Force, Canada, Second World War",

    "title": "NNPCL/TotalEnergies JV record zero gas flare in all its assets",
    "text": "The joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and TotalEnergies has accomplished the end of routine gas flaring across all its assets. This milestone was disclosed during an inspection of the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 100 in the southeastern Niger Delta, off Port Harcourt, by a combined team from NNPC Ltd and TotalEnergies. The Chief Corporate Communications Officer of NNPC Ltd, Olufemi Soneye, made this announcement in a statement released on Thursday in Abuja. The inspection aimed to verify the effectiveness of the OML Flare Reduction Project, which was launched in December 2023. According to Soneye, this achievement aligns with the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (unconditional) and 47% (conditional), as outlined in the Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Accord signed during the administration of President Bola Tinubu. - The statement reads, “The NNPC Ltd/TotalEnergies Joint Venture, which is the concession holder of four leases, had hitherto achieved zero routine flaring across OML 99 (2006), OML 102 (2014), and OML 58 (2016), leaving OML 100 as the only lease with routine flaring going on. - “The significance of this achievement is that the last routine flare volume of about 12MMscf/d (twelve million standard cubic feet per day) of gas has now been eliminated giving rise to a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of about 341KtCO₂e/yr. - “The achievement is an outcome of a programme introduced by the NNPC Ltd. to galvanize action towards achieving the zero routine flare by 2030 across its portfolio of assets.” What you should know - Nigeria has been flaring gas since the 1950s as a result of the inability to utilise the product to generate electricity. In July 2023, the speaker of the House of Reps stated that Nigeria loses around [$2.5 billion](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjy4pu96q6EAxWuQkEAHZ3TCCoQFnoECCYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnairametrics.com%2F2023%2F07%2F25%2Fofficial-nigeria-loses-2-5-billion-annually-to-gas-flaring%2F&usg=AOvVaw0_jZ88b76lZ6aagGS01QNX&opi=89978449)annually to gas flaring. - Beyond the monetary cost, gas flaring negatively affects the environment and health of people living around flare sites. A world bank [publication](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/impact-gas-flaring-child-health-nigeria)revealed that there is significant correlation between gas flaring and rampant cases of respiratory illness, fever and cough among children living in communities with flare sites. - Other medical studies show relationship between living in communities with flare sites and being hypertensive. - Nigeria has had fines in place to discourage gas flaring since 1969 and since 1984, it has been illegal to flare gas without the written permission of the Minister of Petroleum resources. The current fee for gas flaring stands at [$2 per 1000 scf of gas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5717961/). - Significant progress has been made in reducing gas flaring. Between 2012 and 2015, Nigeria reduced flared gas by [2 billion cubic meters](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/03/10/nigerias-flaring-reduction-target-2020)according to the world bank and another study revealed that Nigeria reduced gas flaring by 30% between 2012 and 2021.",
