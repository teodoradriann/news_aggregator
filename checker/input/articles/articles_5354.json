    "text": "Shell, Energy Storage and the Sustainable Hydrogen Fallacy\n[James Darley](/author/james-darley)\nAs COP29's Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge session gets underway, the renewable energy sector faces a persistent challenge that threatens to maintain fossil fuel dependency: storage capacity.\nDespite significant advances in renewable energy generation, the intermittent nature of these power sources poses a substantial hurdle to complete decarbonisation.\nHow to solve the problem\n\"If we don't figure out a way of storing renewable energy, there's a chance we're still going to be dependent on fossil fuels\", warns Neel Dhanesha of Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab, highlighting the critical nature of the storage challenge facing the industry.\nCurrent solutions present a mixed picture of progress and limitations. While battery storage offers immediate possibilities, particularly for residential solar installations, the environmental and social impacts of [lithium](https://sustainabilitymag.com/sustainability/sustainably-sourced-lithium-daimler-and-mercedes-benz) mining raise serious sustainability concerns.\nPumped storage [hydropower](https://sustainabilitymag.com/renewable-energy/hydropower-energy-mexico-threatened-droughts) has emerged as a leading solution, with global capacity recently surpassing 200GW following the completion of China's Fengning facility in August 2024.\nThe 3.6GW plant represents a significant milestone in large-scale energy storage, though the technology's geographic limitations restrict widespread adoption.\nWhat is the stock of renewable gas?\nThe [renewable gas](https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/sustainability-concern-does-the-eu-need-to-examine-biofuels) sector, particularly green hydrogen and biogas, is attracting substantial investment from major energy companies. Shell's Director of Integrated Gas and New Energies, Maarten Wetselaar, puts a fine point on hydrogen's potential.\n\"Hydrogen is one of the key technologies that will help decarbonise heavy industry, [transport](https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/what-does-skoda-hyundais-new-deal-mean-for-hydrogen-cars) and power generation,\" he says. \"It has the potential to play a major role in the energy transition and we are focused on making it a core part of our [future energy system](https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/uk-budget-who-gets-governments-green-investments).\"\nBiogas represents a significant advancement in sustainable fuel technology, with lifecycle assessments indicating its greenhouse gas emissions are substantially lower than those of conventional natural gas.\nHowever, industry experts note that widespread adoption faces challenges in production capacity and securing consistent feedstock supplies.\nHydrogen fuel production presents additional complexities, particularly in its classification system and production methods. Despite hydrogen being naturally abundant, harnessing it as an energy carrier requires a lot of work, electricity and money.\nThe most environmentally sound approach involves water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources - this is known as green hydrogen.\nThe green hydrogen process creates storable fuel by splitting water molecules into their constituent elements, effectively allowing excess renewable power to be captured and preserved for future use.\nAs Dennis Schulz, CEO of ITM — a British market leader in energy storage and green hydrogen production — says: \"Green hydrogen will play an important role in the energy transition.\"\nWhat are major energy companies doing to address this issue?\nMajor energy corporations are positioning themselves at the forefront of storage innovation. Shell's involvement in the NortH₂ project demonstrates significant commitment to green hydrogen production using offshore wind energy.\nSimilarly, Equinor's Chief Executive Officer Anders Opedal has highlighted the company's focus on hydrogen development in the past.\n\"Hydrogen is essential to meeting the world's climate goals,\" he said. \"We are working to accelerate the development of hydrogen technologies, which will be critical to decarbonising heavy industry and long-haul transport\".\nUniper has also embraced hydrogen as central to its strategy. Whilst at Uniper, former CEO Andreas Schierenbeck said \"hydrogen is a crucial part of our decarbonisation strategy. We believe it will be the backbone of a sustainable energy future, especially for sectors where electrification is not an option\".\nIs hydrogen the biggest red herring of the energy transition?\nHowever, hydrogen's role in the energy transition faces significant criticism, particularly regarding its efficiency as a heating solution.\nJan Rosenow, Vice President and European Programme Director of the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), presents a scathing assessment.\n\"It's deeply problematic to think about using hydrogen at large scale to heat buildings,\" he says.\n\"It's very, very inefficient compared to heat pumps. You need five to six times more electricity if you use green hydrogen to create heat, five to six times more renewables, five to six times more land, facilities and everything else\".\nJan points to ulterior motives influencing the discourse: \"The evidence is crystal clear. We're still seeing people everyday championing that idea of using hydrogen for heating, and why is that? Basically, because there are very strong vested interests in keeping the gas grid running\".\n'We need a portfolio of solutions'\nAs the industry grapples with these challenges, Maarten advocates for a comprehensive approach, saying: \"We need a portfolio of solutions — hydrogen, renewable gas, energy storage and carbon capture technologies — to build the future energy system.\n\"By working together, we can unlock the potential of these technologies to decarbonise and create a more resilient, sustainable energy system\".\nCelia Greaves, CEO of The Hydrogen Energy Association will be discussing this topic further at Sustainability LIVE: Net Zero on 5/6 March 2025, [get your tickets now](https://sustainability-live.com/netzero/).\nMake sure you check out the latest edition of [Sustainability Magazine](https://sustainabilitymag.com/magazines) and also sign up to our global conference series - [Sustainability LIVE](https://sustainability-live.com/)\nSustainability Magazine is a [BizClik](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/) brand",

By Reena Bhardwaj Washington, DC [US], March 8 : US President Joe Biden delivered his fourth State of the Union address and told the nation in his annual address on Thursday that the American economy is the \"envy of the world\" and the US stands up against China's unfair economic practices. Touting his policy towards China, Biden said, \"We're standing up against China's unfair economic practices. And standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I've revitalised our partnerships and alliances in the Pacific India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Pacific Islands.\" Without mentioning the name of former President Donald Trump, Biden repeatedly addressed his likely opponent in the November election as \"my predecessor\" and sought to contrast his policies with Trump and Republicans in Congress, including on China. \"For years, all I've heard from my Republican friends and so many others is China's on the rise and America is falling behind,\" Biden said, adding, \"They've got it backwards. America is rising.\" \"I've made sure that most advanced American technologies can't be used in China, not allowing to trade them there. Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,\" Biden underscored during his address. Biden specifically hit on several foreign policy flashpoints, while pushing for action on domestic issues like reproductive health care and high immigration. Biden, at the top of his address, called out Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. \"Overseas, (President Vladimir) Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond,\" he went on to say. \"Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself,\" Biden added. \"Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, 'Do whatever the hell you want.' A former American president actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader. It's outrageous. It's dangerous. It's unacceptable,\" he said, adding, \"My message to President Putin ... is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down!\" Biden said. \"I will not bow down!\" On the Hamas-Israel conflict, Biden announced a new US plan to bolster humanitarian assistance for Gaza. \"Tonight, I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments, carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. No US boots will be on the ground.\" The president pressed for a ceasefire and for Israel to provide immediate relief for Palestinians trapped in war-ravaged Gaza. \"To the leadership of Israel, I say this: humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip,\" Biden said. \"Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\" The State of the Union was watched by what will likely be one of Biden's largest audiences in the months leading up to Election Day.

    "text": "The superintendent in Newton, Massachusetts, has notified families in the district that any students not up to date with their vaccinations will not be welcome at the district's schools in the fall.\nAnna Nolin said in a memo to the school committee last week that a meeting with Newton Health and Human Services and the city's nursing division revealed that a significant number of students were allowed to attend school during the COVID pandemic without the immunizations that are required in Mass. to attend public school. Now, five years later, there are still 182 students who remain in the district's schools with improper vaccination.\nStream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\n WATCH HERE\nWhile the former superintendent was allowed to waive the vaccine requirements during the pandemic, Nolin says she is now reinstating these vaccine expectations.\nNolin said there was a review of student vaccination status following a recent outbreak of chicken pox, which brought this information to light.\nGet updates on what's happening in Boston to your inbox with our News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP\nNewton Public Schools has a student population of about 11,000 students. Of the 182 kids who are not up to date with state vaccine requirements, approximately 42 of them are not fully immunized against measles, according to the superintendent, which has sparked concern given that the U.S. has seen an uptick in measles cases this year, with several states reporting major outbreaks. Two unvaccinated children have died in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult died in New Mexico. It was also announced earlier this month that a person with measles had visited Boston, possibly exposing other people at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Westin Boston Seaport District hotel, and Logan Airport.\nAccording to Nolin, the city's Health and Human Services department has reached out directly to the families of students not vaccinated against measles, explaining that if they are exposed to the virus, they must quarantine for 21 days, during which time the district is not required to makeup any missed education.\nThe superintendent added that there is no barrier in Newton for any family to be vaccinated according to state law, noting that Health and Human Services has vaccines for measles and all required vaccinations for any families that need assistance or do not have medical care. Nursing staff has even offered in some cases to travel to families' homes to complete vaccinations.\nPersonalized outreach with detailed expectations will be shared with each family who has a student that is not in accordance with the state's vaccine guidance.\nAny student not fully vaccinated without exemption will be excluded from school, according to Nolin, who sent a notice to all families with school-aged children, as well as the school committee, informing them of this renewed push for up-to-date vaccinations.\n\"Please note that when we return to school in the fall, any child who is not vaccinated in accordance with the vaccination guidance we have included above--which is the state requirements for school attendance--the students will not be allowed to return to school until those requirements are met,\" Nolin wrote.\nThe superintendent added that the only exception to these requirements will be a written statement from a doctor that immunization would not be in the best interests of the child, or by the student's parent or guardian stating that vaccination or immunization is contrary to the religious beliefs of the student or their parent or guardian.\nHealth officials say measles is a highly contagious virus that begins with flu-like symptoms, including cough, high fever, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, followed by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body. It can be spread through breathing, coughing and sneezing, and it can be contracted if surfaces are touched within two hours of an infected person being in the area.",

Compartir Un debate suscitado en el Parlamento de Galicia tiene su resonancia en Andújar y en lo más profundo de su historia y de su religión. Las cortes gallegas acaban de aprobar una declaración que propone documentar las razones para contemplar el denominado Camino Eufrasiano como uno más de los Caminos a Santiago, o al menos como una variante oficial de la ruta francesa, la más transitada. La propuesta fue presentada por el BNG y aprobada por unanimidad. El presidente de la Asociación Amigos del Camino de Santiago de Andújar, Antonio Porras, ha confesado que este hecho es una recompensa a todo el esfuerzo que se está haciendo desde Andújar, por conectar la ciudad con Santiago de Compostela, a través de San Eufrasio, patrón de Andújar y de la Diócesis de Jaén, que tiene su vinculación con tierras gallegas, al encontrarse sus restos en iglesia la iglesia lucense de Santa María do Mao, concretamente en el municipio de Incio. La Asociación Amigos del Camino de Santiago de Andújar: 'Camino Eufrasiano' nació con la finalidad de unir a dos tierras, la andujareña y la gallega que tienen un denominador común; su vinculación con uno de los varones apostólicos que vinieron a España, San Eufrasio. Recorrido El camino sale de Andújar y llega hasta el Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza, para después enlazar con el camino mozárabe, justo en la localidad cordobesa de Alcaracejos. Desde aquí sale hasta Trujillo, que llega hasta la Vía de la Plata, para en un último tramo llegar hasta la parroquia de Santa María del Mao, que precede al punto final que es Santiago de Compostela. Este último tramo es que el se defiende desde Galicia. Una etapa supone ocho horas de camino diario, con una media de 30 kilómetros diarios aproximadamente, con el descanso incluido en los albergues. Sus integrantes lo han realizado en varias épocas del año y lo han ido recorriendo de una forma alternativa. Porras considera que también se le concede valor a la devoción de San Eufrasio, patrón de Andújar y de Jaén. En la iglesia de Santiago de Compostela se celebrará su festividad el próximo día 13 de enero. Paralelamente, su colectivo, ha iniciado un programa en Radio Andújar ' A Santiago voy', donde se da a conocer este camino, donde Porras quiere que concite el mismo interés entre las administraciones andaluzas provinciales y locales, como sí lo han hecho en Galicia.

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link) Le président de la République démocratique du Congo Félix Tshisekedi, largement vainqueur des élections de décembre qualifiées de \"simulacre\" par l'opposition, a prêté serment samedi à Kinshasa pour un second mandat de cinq ans, dans un climat politique et sécuritaire tendu. Comme pour le lancement de sa campagne électorale, \"Fatshi\", 60 ans, avait vu grand et choisi pour son investiture le stade des Martyrs, rempli au maximum de sa capacité de 80.000 places. Une vingtaine de chefs d'Etat africains et des délégations de plusieurs dizaines d'autres pays étaient présents, pour une cérémonie voulue populaire mais sous haute sécurité et très protocolaire, avec fanfare, cavalerie et prières. Des partisans du président de la République démocratique du Congo Félix Tshisekedi (C) lors de sa prestation de serment, le 20 janvier 2024 à Kinshasa \"Je jure solennellement (...) de défendre la Constitution et les lois de la République, (...), de maintenir son indépendance et l'intégrité de son territoire\", a déclaré devant les juges de la Cour constitutionnelle le président réélu, avant de recevoir les salutations des chefs coutumiers des 26 provinces du pays. \"J'ai conscience de vos attentes\", a ensuite déclaré Félix Tshisekedi dans son discours d'investiture, en évoquant le chômage, le pouvoir d'achat, les jeunes, les femmes, la cohésion nationale... Sa première prestation de serment, en janvier 2019, lorsqu'il succédait à Joseph Kabila (2001-2018) après une élection controversée, avait eu lieu dans les jardins du très solennel palais de la Nation. Des partisans du président de la République démocratique du Congo Félix Tshisekedi (C) lors de sa prestation de serment, le 20 janvier 2024 à Kinshasa Fils de l'opposant historique Étienne Tshisekedi, décédé deux ans auparavant, il prenait alors les rênes de l'immense pays d'Afrique centrale, riche en minerais mais à la population majoritairement pauvre, en promettant d'améliorer les conditions de vie des Congolais et de mettre fin à 25 ans de violences armées dans l'Est. Il n'a pas atteint ses objectifs mais a mené campagne, avec force moyens, sur \"les acquis\" de son premier mandat, tels que la gratuité de l'enseignement primaire, et demandé aux électeurs de lui accorder un second mandat pour les \"consolider\". La présidentielle a eu lieu en même temps que les élections législatives, provinciales et locales, un quadruple scrutin qui a démarré le 20 décembre et, face aux multiples problèmes logistiques, s'est étalé sur plusieurs jours. Au final, lors d'une élection à un seul tour et face à une vingtaine d'autres candidats, Félix Tshisekedi s'est offert un triomphe, avec plus de 73% des voix. Loin derrière sont arrivés Moïse Katumbi, ancien gouverneur du Katanga (sud-est), avec 18% des suffrages, suivi de l'autre opposant, Martin Fayulu (environ 5%). Le Dr Denis Mukwege, prix Nobel de la paix pour son action auprès des femmes victimes de viols de guerre, a officiellement engrangé seulement 0,22% des voix. Le président de la République démocratique du Congo Félix Tshisekedi (D) après sa prestation de serment, le 20 janvier 2024 à Kinshasa Après avoir annoncé le 31 décembre les résultats de la présidentielle, la Céni a publié le 14 janvier ceux des législatives qui, tout en provoquant eux aussi des contestations, dessinent une majorité pour \"l'Union sacrée\" formée autour du président. Les principaux opposants, qui demandent l'annulation pure et simple des élections, avaient envisagé une manifestation dès le 27 décembre, mais elle a été interdite par les autorités et étouffée dans l'œuf par la police. Depuis, les accusations de fraude, tricherie et autre \"braquage électoral\" ont continué et les craintes de violences demeurent, dans un pays au passé politique très agité. Jeudi, Moïse Katumbi et Martin Fayulu ont réitéré leur appel à l'annulation du vote et demandé aux Congolais de manifester leur mécontentement le jour de l'investiture du président réélu, sans appeler toutefois à des marches ou rassemblements, systématiquement réprimés selon eux. Des partisans du président de la République démocratique du Congo Félix Tshisekedi (C) lors de sa prestation de serment, le 20 janvier 2024 à Kinshasa Selon des correspondants de l'AFP, quelques pneus ont été brûlés en début de matinée à Goma, chef-lieu du Nord-Kivu (Est), et des jeunes ont tenté de barricader des rues à Beni, autre ville de la province. Mais la police a vite rétabli l'ordre. Après une trêve pendant les élections, les combats font de nouveau rage dans le Nord-Kivu entre l'armée et la rébellion du M23, soutenue par le Rwanda voisin. Depuis la mi-décembre, une force de la Communauté d'Afrique australe (SADC) est en cours de déploiement dans la région, succédant à une force d'Afrique de l'Est congédiée par Kinshasa pour cause de supposée complaisance à l'égard des rebelles. Cette semaine, un officier congolais a dit compter sur elle pour aider la RDC à \"récupérer les territoires\" occupés.",

    "title": "Prosecutor clears WSU police officer in fatal shooting",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – A Washington State University campus police officer was justified in using deadly force when he fatally shot a gun-wielding man barricaded inside a Pullman apartment last December, according to a prosecutor’s review of the incident. Authorities said Brent Kopacka had threatened to shoot a roommate and claimed he was going to start killing people before firing a handgun out a window during a prolonged overnight standoff with police that began on Dec. 14, 2022 at the Coffee House Apartments in 1000 block of SE Latah Street. Despite officers’ repeated requests for him to surrender peacefully, even after their deployment of OC pepper gas into the apartment, the 36-year-old Kopacka refused to exit the building. He then began shooting toward police officers and an occupied student dormitory. At that point, Kopacka was fatally shot by Sgt. Brett Boyd, a WSU police officer and sniper with the regional SWAT unit. “… when Mr. Kopacka was shot, there did not appear to be any reasonable alternative,” Whitman County prosecutor Denis Tracy wrote in his review of the incident. “Under all the circumstances known to Sgt. Boyd, he had a good faith belief that the use of deadly force was necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to other officers and civilians.” “Sgt. Boyd’s actions were lawful and appropriate under (state law) … In short, Sgt. Boyd clearly did the right thing for the right reasons,” stated Tracy, concluding, “there will not be any criminal prosecution.” The prosecutor issued his determination in a Nov. 29 letter to WSU police chief Gary Jenkins and Lt. Scott Davis of the Washington State Patrol, which conducted an independent investigation into the incident and delivered its findings to Tracy for review in early October. Tracy said he spoke to Kopacka’s mother about the case and she informed him of her son’s mental health problems after suffering a traumatic brain injury from an explosion while serving “with valor and distinction” with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. In the following years, Kopacka suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in varying degrees that possibly contributed to his actions on the night he died, said the prosecutor, adding, “In my view, this compounds tragedy upon tragedy.” “But it does not change the analysis of whether Sgt. Boyd acted legally and appropriately. Without question, he did,” Tracy stated. Washington state law requires independent investigations to be conducted in the same manner as criminal cases when a police officer uses force that results in death or substantial bodily harm to another person. Boyd, 38, joined the WSU police department in 2008, has been a member of the regional SWAT unit since 2012, and was promoted to sergeant in 2022. Per standard procedure, he was placed on paid administrative leave during the initial investigation, but returned to regular duty two weeks later, WSU police chief Gary Jenkins said by phone Thursday. While there have been no indications of impropriety or misconduct, and with the prosecutor’s review now completed, Jenkins said an internal review board will be convened in mid-January to see if any department policies or procedures had been violated. A determination is expected by the end of the month, he said.",
