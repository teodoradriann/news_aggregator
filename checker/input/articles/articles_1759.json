    "title": "Helen Anthony sues driver who hit her on California trip",
    "text": "Providence City Councilwoman Helen Anthony is suing the driver who struck her during a trip to California , causing 22 broken ribs and putting her in critical condition.\nThe Providence Journal on Thursday obtained a copy of the suit filed on Dec. 14 in Monterey County Superior Court. It names not only the 82-year-old driver as a defendant, but also the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the Point Lobos Foundation.\nMore: Months after being hit by vehicle, Helen Anthony returns to PVD City Council\nWhat does the lawsuit allege? According to the suit, on the morning of June 10, 2023, Anthony was in a crosswalk within the Point Lobos reserve when one of its employees, driving a 2013 Polaris GEM electric vehicle , struck her. The suit states she had the right-of-way when she was hit, run over and dragged \"underneath the vehicle for some distance.\"\nBecause the vehicle was electric, \"it made no sound as it sped towards Mrs. Anthony,\" the suit said. The parks department was named in the suit as the driver may also be one of its employees.\nMore: Providence Councilwoman Helen Anthony spent weeks recovering from serious injuries in California ICU\nThe suit goes on to say that the driver, according to a California Highway Patrol Report, mistook the gas for the brake when he accelerated, crashing into Anthony.\nThe parks department declined to comment, and the Point Lobos Foundation did not reply to a comment request. It remains unclear whether the driver has already hired an attorney.\nAnthony's attorneys are seeking damages including medical expenses, incidental expenses, loss of earnings, costs of the suit and other relief. Among the noneconomic damages Anthony seeks to be compensated for are \"loss of enjoyment of life,\" emotional distress and anxiety.\nAnthony did not comment on the suit.\nThe councilwoman's husband, Douglas Anthony, is also a plaintiff in the suit, and is seeking economic and noneconomic damages.\nThis is a developing story. More to come.",

    "text": "Port Douglas in far north Queensland, where residents are being urged to conserve water.\nLIVE – Updated at 00:04\nFollow live.\n00:04\nDoritos’ seasoning sparks ‘worker safety concerns’\nFactory workers claim they are having difficulty breathing and experiencing skin irritation after dealing with the seasoning used to make “flamin’ hot” Doritos, a union says.\nSafeWork SA is looking into the claims after the United Workers Union alleged employees at a local Smith’s Snackfood Company factory raised significant safety concerns about the “improper handling of strongly irritating substances”.\nIn a report sent to the workplace regulator, the union said “flaming hot seasoning” dispersed across the factory production area every couple of weeks from a seasoning machine.\n“After interviewing 13 workers from the afternoon shift, 11 reported various effects, including sneezing, coughing, eye and skin irritation, runny nose, sore throat, chest discomfort, and difficulty breathing,” the union’s report said.\nThe union alleged Smith’s failed to maintain safe systems of work and, in another claim, said the factory’s waste hall was unsafe.\nPepsiCo, which owns The Smith’s Snackfood Company, was contacted for comment.\n– AAP\n00:03\nNSW Ambulance will be addressing media at 1pm to deliver a water safety message, following a number of drownings across NSW recently.\nWe will bring you more updates on this then.\n28 Dec 2023 23:36\n‘Only now are we starting to see some relief’\nThe price of petrol spiked globally after Saudi Arabia, Russia and Opec announced they would deliver sustained production cuts.\nRecord levels of oil production from the US and other non-Opec nations, coupled with ongoing uncertainty about the Chinese economy, has helped force downward pressure on prices and delivered petrol pump relief for Australian motorists this Christmas.\nNRMA spokesperson Peter Khoury said Australia’s exposure to the volatility of world oil prices was painfully apparent:\nFuel prices – and in particular diesel – have had a negative impact on the budgets of Australian families and our nation’s economy throughout much of 2023 and only now are we starting to see some relief.\nAustralia’s economy runs on diesel with so much of our goods and services delivered by heavy freight. It also drives key industries like agriculture, mining and manufacturing so higher diesel prices throughout 2023 have reverberated across all sections of our society.\n– AAP\nRefugee health ‘two to three times worse in offshore detention’ 28 Dec 2023 23:35\nThe health of refugees and asylum seekers held in Australia’s offshore detention centres in the Pacific has been found to be two to three times worse than for those detained on mainland Australia.\nThe conclusion was reached in a research paper published in the latest issue of the peer-reviewed International Journal of Migration, Health and Social Care.\nSuccessive Australian governments since 2013 have held asylum seekers in Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, before it was shut down by court order in 2017.\nSince 2013 quarterly health reports have been produced by detention health provider International Health and Medical Services for the government that include information about the number of medical appointments and the reasons for them.\nUniversity of Greenwich researchers Ryan Essex and Erika Kalocsányiová used reports from 2014 to 2017 to create a longitudinal data set to compare onshore and offshore detention, and how they changed with time.\nThey used metrics that measured psychological distress, the number of appointments and prescriptions each quarter, and found offshore detainees generally needed far more medical attention.\nOffshore detainees were more likely to raise a health-related complaint, access health services and be prescribed medications, often at two to three times the rate of those onshore.\nEssex said the results substantiated the anecdotal evidence that had come from detainees and in a number of inquiries that offshore detention was far more detrimental to the health of refugees than onshore detention.\n– AAP\nMelbourne’s Suburban Rail Loop is a multibillion-dollar vision for a ‘city of centres’ – but how long will it take? 28 Dec 2023 23:13 Benita Kolovos\nWhen Dan Andrews’ Victorian government released the business case for the Suburban Rail Loop in 2021, in the middle of yet another Covid-19 lockdown, much of the coverage focused on the cost – $34.5bn for the first stage alone.\nBut contained within the 400-page document was also a new vision for the city of Melbourne. It read:\nSRL is much more than a transport project.\nIt will transform Melbourne into a ‘city of centres’ – supporting vibrant precincts outside the central business district that will provide more high quality jobs, greater housing options, and green and open space in attractive, well-connected neighbourhoods.\nAfter the release of draft vision papers this month, it’s becoming clearer how the project will reshape the first six areas along the SRL East line: Cheltenham, Clayton, Monash, Glen Waverley, Burwood and Box Hill.\nHere’s what we know so far:\nQueensland’s power demand expect to spike again as heatwave rolls on 28 Dec 2023 22:59 Peter Hannam\nQueensland is set for another scorching day as the sunshine state more than lives up to its moniker, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\nActually, it’s not just Queensland but also much of northern Australia that is roasting in unusually hot weather. (And while some people will say, “this is just summer”, it’s worth noting that native species have their thermal limits, as we’ve seen in past heatwaves.)\nThe Christmas-new year period is typically one of relatively low electricity demand because most of industry is taking a break, and roof-top solar and solar farms are harvesting that sunshine.\nSo it was interesting to see Queensland had one of its heaviest days for power demand yesterday, with supplies nearing record levels, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator.\nGiven that today looks likely to be hotter than yesterday in the populated south-east of the state, it’s not surprising that Aemo is forecasting power demand to peak a bit higher.\nPaul McArdle, an energy expert at Global-Roam, noted on his Watt Clarity website that the demand jump comes even as about 50,000 households remain offline because of the Christmas Day storms across parts of the state. (Media reports this morning put the number at about 35,000.)\nAs McArdle notes, we’re lucky the heatwave isn’t happening a bit later in the summer:\nImagine what would have happened to the demand levels had this same weather pattern hit us late in January or early February 2024 with industry and commercial industrial energy users back at work!?\nHe added that the state would “surely” break the all-time demand record of 10,119 megawatts if such heatwaves return then.\nAustralia’s most expensive cities for petrol revealed 28 Dec 2023 22:41\nDrivers in Brisbane bore the brunt of record petrol prices this year with the Queensland capital the nation’s most expensive city to put fuel in the tank.\nRegular unleaded cost on average 193.4 cents a litre, an NRMA analysis of 2023 petrol prices across the nation revealed.\nIt was a different story for Perth, which had the lowest average for regular unleaded at 183.9 cents a litre, cementing the city’s place as cheapest or second cheapest capital since 2017.\nAdelaide, which has one of the strongest concentrations of independent service stations in the country, recorded the second cheapest price for the year at 186 cents a litre.\nSydney’s average of 190.7 cents a litre made the harbour city the fourth cheapest capital, despite being the nation’s largest market.\nRecord petrol prices and a continuation of highly volatile movements in global oil prices in 2023 contributed significantly to the nation’s inflation crisis and rising interest rates.\nIn September petrol prices reached the highest on record in Australia.\n– AAP\n(More to come on this one … )\n28 Dec 2023 22:40\nMan accused of exposing himself to children at Melbourne beach\nA 52-year-old man has been charged with lewd behaviour in front of teenage girls at St Kilda in Melbourne’s south-east.\nDetectives arrested the man at Preston in Melbourne’s north-east yesterday after Victoria police in October called for the public’s help to find the person behind incidents in the St Kilda area on Boxing Day 2022 and January 8 2023.\nBoth allegedly involved a man approaching teenage girls then exposing himself and performing a lewd act.\nThe first took place on Beaconsfield Parade at Middle Park and the second happened near the water on the popular St Kilda beach, police alleged.\nOfficers raided a home at Heidelberg Heights in Melbourne’s north-east and seized a number of items before they arrested the man, who was charged with a total of 13 offences.\nThe charges included performing a sexual act in the presence of a child, directing sexual activity at another person, sexual exposure and committing offences while on bail.\nThe 52-year-old was granted bail to face Melbourne magistrates court today.\n– AAP\nAlive primed to claim Sydney to Hobart overall win 28 Dec 2023 22:38\nTasmanian yacht Alive is in the box seat to take out Sydney to Hobart yacht race’s overall honours, with skipper Duncan Hine confident the 66-footer has a winning time on the board.\nHine and his crew finished the 628-nautical-mile blue water classic yesterday afternoon as clubhouse leaders on handicap time.\nAlive is no stranger to success, having claimed the overall win in 2018 and fourth spot in 2019. Hine said:\nIt’s a waiting game. We’re looking good, though. I believe we could do it again, but the reality may be different. Now we wait with bated breath to see if anyone can beat our time.\nAlive was one of just six yachts to have crossed the River Derwent finish line by last night, with more than 80 still at sea.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:37\nHow Hobart and Adelaide are bringing in 2024\nThe Hobart waterfront is expected to be packed as spectators celebrate 25 years since the city’s first New Year’s Eve river fireworks.\nLord mayor Anna Reynolds said the $127,000 event would include two nine-minute shows from multiple barges on the Derwent.\nIn Adelaide, revellers can enjoy 9pm and midnight fireworks coupled with live music at a Riverbank event.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:36\nWhat’s in store for Brisbane’s NYE\nBrisbane’s official New Year’s Eve event has not been altered despite heatwave conditions in the days beforehand.\nAn event at South Bank Parklands will include two fireworks displays along the Brisbane River, one at 8.30pm and one at midnight.\nGold Coast council was yesterday considering cancelling some events, with a possible risk of fire amid heatwave conditions and emergency services continuing to respond to storm-damaged homes.\nBut it continued to list fireworks events on its website, including at 8pm at Coomera Sports Park and Broadwater Parklands, 8.30pm at Lake Orr Varsity Promenade and 9pm at Paradise Point Parklands.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:35\nWestern Australia’s NYE festivities\nWA will celebrate the New Year with community events, parties and fireworks displays across the state.\nPerth city will be treated to two explosive displays, one at 8pm from a barge on the Swan River and a second at 11.59pm, when fireworks on top of buildings dotted across the city announce the arrival of 2024.\nNew Year’s Eve fireworks are also planned in Karratha, Esperance, Albany and Pemberton, on Rottnest Island and the Cocos Islands, at Rockingham, Mandurah and a handful of other Perth beach and riverfront suburbs.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:34\nWhat to expect from Melbourne’s NYE\nIn Melbourne, a similar New Year’s Eve crowd to 2022 is expected, when a record 475,000 people flooded the CBD.\nA midnight fireworks display will showcase more lasers and projections than previous years, lighting up the skyline from 27 rooftops.\nThe City of Melbourne has designated four “celebration zones” where families can watch the 9.30pm fireworks, and measures will be in place to avoid pedestrian “pinch points”, including closing the Elizabeth Street underpass, lord mayor Sally Capp said:\nWe are expecting a safe and sparkling New Year’s Eve for hundreds of thousands of Melburnians and Victorians who will come into the city to celebrate.\nThousands of police officers will be out in force and conducting an operation to find people carrying weapons on New Year’s Eve.\nAcross Victoria, public transport will be free from 6pm on New Year’s Eve to 6am on New Year’s Day.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:33\nHow Sydney is welcoming the new year\nNew Year’s Eve revellers across Australia are preparing to farewell 2023 with multiple cities set to sparkle with fireworks, light shows and illuminations.\nSydney will be one of the first major cities in the world to celebrate the start of the new year and will set the tone with 20 minutes of fireworks in two displays, a smoking ceremony, AI-driven projections on to the Harbour Bridge and illuminated boats on the water.\nPeople wanting to celebrate from one of many non-ticketed foreshore vantage points are being urged to use public transport rather than travel by car. Spectators are encouraged to arrive early to secure their spot.\n– AAP\n(Keep an eye out for a few posts to come on other cities and their celebrations!)\n28 Dec 2023 22:32\nFierce heatwave conditions to scorch northern Australia\nTemperatures are expected to soar across most of northern Australia over the coming days.\nParts of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face extreme to severe heatwave conditions from today, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43C, while temperatures up to 37C are forecast for Gympie in the state’s storm-ravaged south-east.\nHighs up to 36C are predicted in Brisbane today, while Longreach in the state’s west is forecast to reach to 47C at the weekend.\nMore than 42,000 people remained without power across south-east Queensland yesterday as the state recorded higher than average temperatures.\nIn the Northern Territory, temperatures today are predicted to reach 40C in Katherine and 43C in Tennant Creek.\nMarble Bar in WA’s Pilbara region may reach 49C tomorrow and temperatures up to 45C are expected there for the next six days.\n– AAP\nGood morning 28 Dec 2023 22:28\nThis is Rafqa Touma, and here are the headlines that rolled in overnight.\nAs the new year approaches, heatwave conditions will spread across northern Australia, while the east coast can expect more thunderstorms and showers. The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts rain will probably have cleared for midnight firework celebrations in major cities, with Brisbane set to be the wettest.\nTents and caravans were swept away during 30-minute deluge that inundated Buchan campsite, with holidaymakers describing the terrifying moment a wall of water inundated the popular camping site in regional Victoria on Boxing Day, leaving two people dead and millions of dollars’ worth of damage.\nA teenage boy died after a shark attack near Ethel Beach in South Australia and a kayaker has died in waters off Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula.\nI’ll be rolling the blog through the day – if you see anything you don’t want us to miss, send it my way on X, formerly Twitter, at @At_Raf.\nMore severe thunderstorms forecast across NYE weekend 28 Dec 2023 22:26\nNew Year’s Eve could be a wet one for parts of eastern Australia, with more severe weather forecast for the weekend.\n(Meanwhile, northern Australia can expect fierce heatwave conditions – more to come on that.)\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says widespread showers and possibly thunderstorms are to return to NSW and Queensland from today.\nNorth-east NSW will bear the brunt of the rain in the state, with isolated and possibly severe thunderstorms into Sunday. Scattered showers are forecast for the remainder of the coast, with the chance of storms.\nQueensland is also expected to be hit by wet weather, with isolated showers and thunderstorms forecast across much of the state tomorrow, apart from the far south-west. Senior meteorologist Sarah Scully says:\nSevere thunderstorms are possible … between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days.\nIsolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia, alongside showers and storms for eastern South Australia and northern Victoria.\nThere is a risk of severe thunderstorms around Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter region.\n– AAP\n28 Dec 2023 22:23\nEmergency alert for Port Douglas, Mossman and Newell beach\nResidents of Port Douglas, Mossman and Newell beach in Queensland have been urged to conserve water and cease non-essential water use in an emergency alert issued by the Douglas shire council.\nResidents are advised that water infrastructure in the area has been affected by a landslip, which has resulted in a lower rate of water production, according to a Queensland fire emergency service statement:\nWater storage is currently at critical levels.",

    "text": "“Da novembre dello scorso anno, i lavoratori impegnati nelle pulizie e sanificazione in appalto presso il Macello Martini, organizzati da SGB, rivendicano un salario dignitoso, oggi fermo a poco più di 7 euro lordi all’ora”.I lavoratori del sindacato Sgb hanno indetto uno sciopero senza preavviso per protesta contro la società appaltatrice Itl Servizi: “Costretti dall’indisponibilità al confronto della società appaltatrice, la ITL Servizi, ad alzare il livello dell’azione sindacale, dopo tre giornate di sciopero organizzate fra dicembre e gennaio, il 17 febbraio i lavoratori hanno di nuovo incrociato le braccia, ma in questa occasione senza dare alcun preavviso all’azienda ed iniziando l’astensione a turno già iniziato, creando un forte rallentamento nella produzione nello stabilimento. Allo sciopero riuscito, anche per la totale adesione dei lavoratori impegnati nel turno, ITL e Magema (la cooperativa che gestisce il macello per conto di Martini Carni) hanno reagito con la rappresaglia antisindacale, licenziando i cinque lavoratori, iscritti a SGB, che avevano organizzato l’azione sindacale. L’accusa ai lavoratori è quella di avere, con lo sciopero, bloccato la produzione e avere attentato al benessere degli animali in attesa della macellazione. Uno “stravagante” illecito ritenuto da ITL e Magema penalmente sanzionabile, tanto da richiedere l’intervento dei Carabinieri per fermare lo sciopero”.“Le accuse infondate rivolte ai lavoratori, tra cui il pretesto del benessere animale - continua la nota - rivelano una strategia per criminalizzare lo sciopero, completata con le più disparate accuse ai lavoratori, confezionate ad arte anche per giustificare la richiesta dell’intervento delle forze dell’ordine, di fatto utilizzate, a loro insaputa, per intimidire i lavoratori. Come sindacato abbiamo raccolto prove che dimostrano il carattere punitivo del licenziamento, che ha evidentemente l’unico scopo di allontanare gli iscritti di SGB dallo stabilimento, per reprimere definitivamente ogni iniziativa sindacale e ogni richiesta di miglioramento del trattamento economico per i lavoratori in appalto.Malgrado le prove prodotte dal sindacato, da parte di ITL Servizi e Magema (a cui è stato anche richiesto un incontro, senza ottenere risposta) vi è stata solo la conferma dei licenziamenti. Le società hanno inoltre rifiutato di esibire i filmati che hanno ripreso i fatti del 17 febbraio, sebbene ne abbiano dichiarato il possesso ai Carabinieri, consapevoli che quei filmati avrebbero smascherato la loro ricostruzione tendenziosa dello sciopero.Se è evidente l’illegittimità dei licenziamenti da parte di ITL, non possiamo non rilevare le responsabilità della società Magema (e di Martini Carni, per la quale gestisce il macello) il cui interesse è quello di tenere bassi i costi dell’appalto.Non pare certo un problema per Magema se ITL Servizi, con diversi cambi societari, continui da anni ad aggiudicarsi l’appalto, pur avendo con le precedenti società (prima con P.H.F.C., poi con SAG Pulizie e SAG srl) sottratto ai lavoratori parte della retribuzione con finti part-time e persista oggi nel corrispondergli un salario da fame.Mentre Magema si dichiara preoccupata per il benessere degli animali, ignora chi, con 7 euro l’ora, non arriva a fine mese, dimostrando di essere in realtà interessata solo a fare profitti, anche se sulla pelle dei lavoratori.I licenziamenti sono già stati impugnati nei confronti di ITL Servizi, ma la nostra iniziativa non si può fermare all’azione legale.Per questo, nei prossimi giorni organizzeremo un presidio di fronte al Macello Martini, in solidarietà ai lavoratori licenziati e pretenderne il loro immediato reintegro, in difesa del diritto di sciopero e del loro diritto alla lotta sindacale contro lo sfruttamento negli appalti, per giusto salario”.",

Gernot Weissensteiner, der Direktor der HTL Vöcklabruck, bestätigt die Vorfälle. Es gebe auch Videomaterial, das sichergestellt worden sei. Details nennt Weissensteiner keine. Die Polizei ermittelt.\nFall flog vor zwei Wochen in der Schule auf\nDer Fall sei vor zwei Wochen ins Rollen gekommen, so Direktor Weissensteiner: „Es hat eigentlich eine harmlose Rangelei gegeben. Ein Lehrer hat das beobachtet. Er ist sofort dazwischen gegangen. Durch mehrmaliges Nachfragen hat der betroffene Schüler gesagt ‚Mir geht’s eh nicht so schlecht, aber es gibt Schüler bei uns in der Klasse, denen geht’s viel schlimmer‘. Und natürlich sind wir dem nachgegangen. Es hat sich dann herauskristallisiert, was sich da anbahnt“.\nOpfer und Täter sind zwischen 15 und 16 Jahren alt. Die drei misshandelten Burschen sind derzeit krankgeschrieben. Die Polizei ermittelt.\nMehrere Schüler suspendiert\nDie gewalttätigen Schüler dürfen momentan nicht in die Schule gehen. Sie wurden von der Bildungsdirektion suspendiert. Niemand habe Anzeichen für Mobbing gesehen, auch die Eltern der Burschen hätten nichts geahnt. Die Klasse sei unauffällig gewesen, die betroffenen Schüler dürften aus Scham geschwiegen haben, so Weissensteiner.\nDie Mobbingfälle werden laut dem Direktor der HTL Vöcklabruck nun in der Schule aufgearbeitet. Im Herbst soll auch es Workshops dazu geben, wie man mit Konflikten umgeht.",

    "title": "Israel-Hamas Conflict & Long-Term Media Tensions",
    "text": "Recent developments in the peace negotiations highlight the challenges of finding common ground, while long-term research reveals how media coverage has both reflected and potentially exacerbated the conflict over time.\nUS officials have expressed optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire deal, with Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, stating that an agreement is “now in sight.” This comes after increased pressure from Washington on both parties to accept a bridging proposal suggested during talks in Qatar last week.\nHowever, both Israel and Hamas have indicated that a breakthrough may not be imminent. Hamas has criticised the latest proposal as leaning too heavily towards Israel’s demands, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly refused to consider withdrawing from key strategic areas in Gaza.\nThe negotiations, scheduled to restart in Cairo, have faced delays. Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted sources close to the talks as saying “the chances for a deal are slim,” though efforts are being made to hold discussions in the coming days.\nWhile current events capture immediate attention, research into media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict provides valuable context for understanding the long-term dynamics at play. A study examining media sentiment from 1995 to 2023 reveals a stark trend of increasing negativity in coverage between the two sides.\nThe data shows that Israeli media stories with a negative sentiment towards Palestinians have risen dramatically, from just over 30% in late 1999 to 92% in early 2023. Similarly, Palestinian media coverage with negative sentiments towards Israelis has increased from just under 30% in 1999 to 85% in 2023.\nThis trend of escalating negative media portrayal coincides with significant events in the region’s history. The research notes a particular spike in tensions following the outbreak of the second intifada in September 2000. While there was some improvement in media sentiment up to 2007, the overall trajectory has been one of increasing negativity for nearly two decades.\nThe protracted nature of the Israel-Hamas conflict exemplifies what experts term a “forever war” – a prolonged conflict that becomes seemingly endless due to continuous cycles of violence perpetuating instability without clear resolution. This concept applies not only to the situation in Gaza but also to other enduring global conflicts, such as the one in Ukraine.\nSeveral factors contribute to the persistence of such conflicts in the modern era. The transition from a unipolar world dominated by a single superpower to a multipolar global order has intensified competition and increased instances of conflict. Rivalries between competing powers often result in significant military support for opposing factions, escalating the risk of severe violence and atrocities.\nTraditional global powers like the US and the EU find themselves stretched thin, struggling to engage effectively in multiple conflict zones simultaneously. Internal pressures and a need to focus on key strategic areas limit their ability to manage global tensions and smaller conflicts as they might have in the past.\nOne major point of contention is Israel’s insistence on maintaining a military presence along the Philadelphi corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. This stance is at odds with Hamas’s position and Egypt’s concerns. Additionally, Netanyahu’s refusal to withdraw from the Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza has emerged as another significant obstacle.\nAs negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza continue, the long-term trends in media coverage and the broader context of “forever wars” serve as a reminder of the deep-rooted challenges facing peacemakers. The stark increase in negative media sentiment between Israelis and Palestinians over the past two decades highlights the need for efforts not only to address immediate military and political concerns, but also to bridge the growing divide in public perception and narratives.\nThe path to lasting peace in the region will likely require not just diplomatic breakthroughs and military arrangements, but also concerted efforts to address the underlying tensions that have been building for decades. As the world watches the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict, the broader historical and media context underscores the complexity of the task at hand and the importance of understanding the long-term dynamics that shape such enduring conflicts.\nSubscribe to the Vision Of Humanity mailing list",
