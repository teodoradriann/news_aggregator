    "text": "綜合報導 / 香港\n香港國安法即將在這個月30日，上路滿5週年，而香港教育局，也在國安法上路後相隔一年，2021年全面推行「國安教育」，學校得根據規定，在重要日子進行指定活動，除了一年一度的國慶日，校內愛國活動幾乎全年無休。不少學者就認為，北京當局透過國安教育，逐步改造香港學生思想，要培養年輕人的愛國情懷，卻可能造成反效果。\n好幾名學生，在台上進行饒舌表演，小大人模樣，成為焦點，但發現了嗎，他們口中唱出的歌詞，竟出現國安法，這一切正是北京當局，一步步改造，香港學生思想的政治手段，香港中學宣傳片：「例如了解國旗背後的故事，之後都提升了我對國家的歸屬感。」\n這個月30日是香港《國安法》實施五週年，而在國安法上路，相隔一年，2021年香港教育局，則全面推行「國安教育」，當地學校得根據「規劃年曆」，在重要日子舉行活動#04TC：0010，展示國安教育的推行成果，香港學生：「作為學生，我認為還需要清晰了解國安法，為未來香港和大灣區，出一分力。」\n國安教育和愛國主義教育深入香港校園，除了一年一度的國慶日，校內愛國活動，可以說是幾乎全年無休，校內課程內容也大幅改變，不斷強調國家觀念和國家安全，甚至傳出有多間學校，在近期收到警告，師生一但參加，美國領事館舉辦的美國國慶活動，就可能觸犯《國安法》。\n香港連儂畫家Otto說：「其實有小孩子的最痛苦，看著那些小孩子，一天一天被他們洗腦，做父母的很痛苦。」當地人再無奈只能遵守規定，國安教育推行後，2022年，香港共流失了2萬7千多名小學生，香港教育朝著「愛國主義」全速前進，同時大批家長則著孩子，紛紛往外逃，要遠離中共當局的紅色洗腦教育。\n新聞來源：華視新聞",
