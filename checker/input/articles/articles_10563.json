INQUIRER / NINO JESUS ORBETA\nActive members of the police and the military will now be exempted from taking drug tests (DT) as well as psychological and psychiatric examinations (PPE) as a requirement for securing a license for firearms that they want to purchase in addition to those issued by the government, the Philippine National Police said on Thursday.\nThe order was contained in a memorandum signed by PNP chief Police Gen. Rommel Marbil on July 16.\nADVERTISEMENT “All active military and police personnel are no longer required to undergo DT and PPE since they are already trained as responsible firearm holders,” Marbil said in the memo.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO LIST: Canceled flights on August 16 due to Typhoon Ampil’s threat NEWSINFO Marcos moves Ninoy Aquino Day to August 23 for longer weekend NEWSINFO Solon hits Cardemas over alleged disinformation, conflict of interest “The DT and PPE conducted during their service will suffice as LTOPF (license to own and possess firearms) requirements,” he added.\nThe PNP chief said the military and the police would only be required to submit their valid PNP or AFP ID in support of their gun license applications.\nNBI, PDEA not covered Lt. Col. Eudisan Gultiano, the spokesperson for the PNP Civil Security Group, said the exemption applies to police and military personnel who are acquiring firearms on top of those issued by the government.\nBased on the latest record, Gultiano said the PNP had about 11,000 expired gun permits while the Armed Forces of the Philippines has about 14,000.\nThe PNP chief’s memo does not cover other law enforcement agencies and uniformed services, such as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the National Bureau of Investigation, and the Philippine Coast Guard, she added.\n“I think there will be another deliberation on this because when it comes to the PNP and AFP, it is easy for us to monitor our personnel,” she said.\nADVERTISEMENT Too busy 24/7 Explaining the exemption, Gultiano said PNP and AFP personnel no longer needed to take new tests since they had already been trained on “responsible gun ownership” and that there are “enough measures” to discipline abusive or erring users.\nShe said Marbil’s memo would also hasten the license applications and renewals.\nREAD: Cops, soldiers exempted from drug, mental test rules to get gun licenses\n“It’s really a big help to our active PNP personnel because sometimes they really do not have time because of 24 hours duty, 24/7 duty,” she added.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "Here’s Why CEOs Should Consider Private Security\nAs the world becomes a more unstable and dangerous place to be, many CEOs are thinking about their personal risk and how they can reduce the chances of being a victim of crime.\nUltra-high net-worth individuals like CEOs are commonly turning to private security firms to provide additional protection and a feeling of reassurance.\nAs a CEO, it can feel like you have a target on your back. You need to be visible for your company profile, but this visibility puts you in the line of fire. It can make some CEOs feel very exposed and might lead them to avoid certain\nCreates a visual deterrent\nHaving a security guard by your side will help to reduce the chance of an opportunistic attack. This is one in which the criminal has not necessarily targeted you specifically, but they have spotted you and recognised an opportunity. You might have expensive accessories, an expensive car or expensive equipment that criminals want to get their hands on. To help prevent this, working with private security\nguarding services can offer peace of mind.\nAllows you to live a normal life\nSimple things like going to the shops or taking your child to school can feel more threatening when you are a high-profile CEO. There might be disgruntled employees or competitors who feel they need to seek revenge, or you might simply attract mentally unstable individuals with strong opinions about your company and what you do.\nRegardless of the threat, you can enjoy a sense of normalcy by having a security guard by your side.\nPeace of mind when travelling\nYou would be right to be concerned when travelling. Being in another part of the world can put you outside of your comfort zone. You might be at greater risk of kidnapping and theft when you are travelling for business or pleasure.\nPrivate security can help you to feel more confident and secure when you travel. It could also allow you to bring your family with you on international trips without worrying about their safety and security. While the risk of something happening is low, it’s better to be safe.\nControl access\nWhen you’re an important person, many people will believe they are entitled to your time. One of the simplest ways that private security can provide protection is by controlling access to you and ensuring only those who have booked an appointment to meet with you can get close.\nIt might seem like overkill to have private security just to provide a gatekeeper service, but you will quickly learn how much of a nuisance it can be to turn people away as they try to demand your time.\nProtect your company\nIt’s not only CEOs that are at risk. Criminals might also target their companies and could use high-profile CEOs and their family members to coordinate attacks. A stolen mobile phone could be used to gain access to sensitive access information, which could then be used to coordinate further attacks.\nMany companies will require their CEOs to at least consult with a private security company to carry out a risk assessment and determine if their services are required. This risk assessment will commonly reveal that multiple areas of weakness could be exploited by criminals.\nAssist with other tasks\nA private security guard might offer additional value by offering extra services such as driving. Having a security guard who is also a driver will not only help to keep you secure and minimise the risk of carjackings, but it will also deliver additional value for your company. This is a special branch of security guard training, so you can expect a close protection guard of this stature to be highly experienced, possibly in the police or military.\nPeace of mind for your family\nIt’s not only\nCEOs who can benefit from close protection, their family members might also appreciate the additional security. It can be daunting to be the parent, spouse or child of a high-profile CEO. These individuals might feel they have a target on their back to their position of influence and their access to wealth. To help provide peace of mind for family members, close protection and home monitoring should be considered to keep everyone safe.\nClosing thoughts\nClose protection for CEOs offers more benefits than downsides. While it might be an additional cost for the company to shoulder, the potential benefits will far outweigh the costs. Close security can help to minimise and eliminate the risk of theft, kidnapping and threatening behaviour. It can help CEOs and their family members to lead more normal lives that are not controlled or influenced by the threat of crime. CEOs will also have the added benefit of only coming into contact with pre-vetted individuals, which can help to save precious time.",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: A sign reading “Help, three hostages” in Hebrew, that the Israeli military says was found on a Gaza building where three Israeli hostages had been hiding before they were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces, hangs from a wall, in this screengrab from a video released on December 17, 2023. Israel Defense Forces/Handout via REUTERS\nBy Emily Rose\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israeli troops killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15 when it mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said on Thursday, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nOn Dec. 15, the military immediately took responsibility for killing the three hostages, who were abducted by militants during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on towns in southern Israel. They were among 240 people taken hostage by the Palestinian group.\nThe Israel military published its findings on Thursday and concluded “that there was no malice in the event, and the soldiers carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment.”\nThe statement said that army chief General Herzi Halevi had “emphasized the utmost importance of adhering to standard operating procedures.”\n“In a situation where there is no immediate threat and the identification is not a clear enemy, there is a need for a moment of examination before firing, given the opportunity,” he said.\nThe killing of the three hostages when they approached Israeli troops in the Shejaiya area of Gaza City, shook Israelis.\nThe investigation found that, during intense days of fighting, there was no intelligence indicating the hostages were being held in buildings where troops encountered heavy fire.\nThe military said footage showed the hostages had removed their shirts and that one of them was waving a white flag but they were only identified as hostages after their bodies had been examined.\nThe hostages’ cries for help were also misinterpreted as deception by militants attempting to draw troops into an ambush.\n“The IDF failed in its mission to rescue the hostages in this event,” Halevi said. “The entire chain of command feels responsible for this difficult event, regrets this outcome, and shares in the grief of the families of the three hostages.”\nPressure has been mounting on the Israeli government to broker a deal to release the more than 100 hostages who remain in Gaza following the release of 110 others during a week-long truce in November.\nDuring the truce, Hamas released more than 100 women, children and foreigners it was holding in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and teenagers being held in Israeli jails.\n(Reporting by Emily Rose; editing by Grant McCool and Howard Goller)",
