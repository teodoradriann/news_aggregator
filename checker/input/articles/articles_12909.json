    "title": "‘I use pool noodles…so far so good’: Plumber shows how to prepare for cold weather and avoid frozen pipes next week",
    "text": "We’re just two weeks into 2024, but we’re already a third of the way through winter, and the worst weather of the season is fast on its way. It’s time to [winterize](https://www.dailydot.com/society/how-to-survive-winter-youtube-guide/) your home before Old Man Winter unpacks his bags, and one professional plumber has taken to TikTok to tell you how. Plumber Jeff Mumm of Jeff Mumm Plumbing (@jeffmummplumbing) posted his advice to TikTok on Thursday. The video already has over 1.2 million views on the strength of Mumm’s advice for keeping your [plumbing safe](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/dorm-room-flooding-explosion/) during the [worst the season](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/jonas-storm-tips/) has to offer. “First thing, guys, is this,” he tells his viewers. “Know how to shut the water off to your house.” He says this is imperative to avoid water damage to your home if a pipe does somehow freeze and burst. “Turn the heat up in your house,” he continues. It’s worth a bigger electric bill if it prevents a frozen pipe. Mumm also advises to “make sure all the interior doors of your house are open” to ensure the heated air reaches every room in your home. “You want air circulating throughout your house.” Mumm also recommends opening bathroom cabinet doors and even shower doors and curtains to allow heated air to reach the bathroom plumbing. “Turn your water on,” he tells his viewers. “Let the water trickle a bit. Think about this: moving water doesn’t freeze as easily as non-moving water.” “I hope these tips help you out and be safe out there,” he concludes. Many of Mumm’s viewers living in Southern states commented to agree with Mumm’s recommendation of letting their faucets flow during the occasional freezes the area experiences. “It’s about the best option, especially for people down south who get cold spells,” Mumm replied. [@jeffmummplumbing] [♬ original sound – JEFF MUMM PLUMBING] Nunya (@the.unpopular.opinion) wrote, “We live in the south and it’s about to be 19 degrees. I have water pipes in my ATTIC. We do wrap outside and trickle water. Any way to keep attic pipes warm????” Mumm answered, “Sorry there is not. I am actually going to do a follow-up video about this. Your best bet is to keep water trickling out all the faucets.” For insulating outdoor faucets, one viewer recommended a DIY approach. “I use pool noodles…so far so good.” At least one Texas viewer has decided to heed Mumm’s advice based on their experience with the bitter winter freeze the state experienced in 2021. “Dallas winter 2021 we did all the dripping and cabinets open but power went out for 3 days so pipe burst. Now I think I will turn off the main,” LinnyLou_seat (@linnylou_seat) wrote. The Daily Dot has reached out to Mumm via email for further comment.",

    "title": "Understanding the Impact of Antihypertensive Drugs on Kidney Function",
    "text": "Some antihypertensive drugs destroy the kidneys’ ability to filter blood over time. This was known, but not how these drugs affect kidney function.\nRecently, American researchers published a study that highlights the mechanism behind this phenomenon. The study on “How blood pressure drugs affect the kidneys” was published in the journal Circulation Research.\nThe study authors found that certain antihypertensive drugs (mainly renin-angiotensin system inhibitors) somehow reprogram the kidneys to stop doing their important job of removing waste from the body, maintaining electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pressure. The kidneys begin to produce more renin, an enzyme, the nerve endings overgrow, the cells lining the kidney’s blood vessels become too large and inflammation sets in… Unable to filter the blood, the kidney is transformed into a “neuro-immune endocrine organ pathological”, explain the authors of this study.\nMore specifically, the researchers observed “excessive stimulation of renin-producing cells in the kidney.”\nInhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are the drugs most frequently indicated in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases.\nThe good news The good news is that elucidating the effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on the kidneys will soon lead to the discovery of solutions. Thus, in the end, it will be possible for antihypertensive drugs to be just as effective, but without these side effects on kidney function.\nObviously, there is no discussion about the elimination of these drugs, considering the serious consequences of untreated hypertension, including major risk of heart attack and accident vascular cerebral .\nFor now, patients using antihypertensive drugs are advised to monitor their possible symptoms: decreased urination, leg swelling, seizures, etc.\nAntihypertensive Drugs: A Double-Edged Sword for Your Kidneys Ah, antihypertensive drugs – the little pills we’re told to pop when our blood pressure’s all over the place. “Take these, and your heart will thank you!” they say, while your kidneys are quietly plotting a rebellion in the corner. Yes, folks, it turns out that some of these miracle workers come with a *surprise twist* – they could be sabotaging your kidneys over time. Drama, intrigue, and a whole lot of science unfold like the latest season of your favorite thriller!\nA recent study published in the journal Circulation Research has spilled the beans on just how these blood pressure drugs are throwing a wrench in kidney function. Researchers in America have unearthed that certain antihypertensive drugs – notably the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors – don’t just lower blood pressure, but instead sneakily reprogram your kidneys to go on permanent sabbatical from their actual job of filtering blood. Talk about betrayal!\nWho Knew Kidneys Could Hold Grudges? Picture this: your kidneys, the unsung heroes of your body, are sitting there minding their own business, working tirelessly to remove waste, keep your electrolytes in check, and maintain blood pressure. Then, these antihypertensive drugs come in, waving their magical wands, saying, “Relax, mate! We’ve got this.” But what they really mean is, “Let’s turn your kidneys into a neuro-immune endocrine organ pathologically!” It’s like getting invited to a party and finding out you’re just the entertainment for the evening – a classic case of “Bait and Switch.”\nAccording to the researchers, the real culprits here are those pesky renin-producing cells in your kidneys, which apparently get a little too *stimulated* when these drugs are around. They produce more renin – it’s like they’ve signed up for a gym membership and are bulking up unnecessarily. And like any good motivational speaker will tell you, inflammation is never a good look! Who knew that effective blood pressure management could come at the expense of kidney performance? It’s like choosing between having a six-pack or your favorite pizza. Your kidneys are basically left crying in the corner, begging for a reprieve!\nThe Silver Lining But fear not! There is good news lurking in the shadows. The researchers assure us that understanding how these antihypertensive drugs screw with our kidneys opens the door for future solutions. In simpler terms, we’re on the road to developing drugs that effectively manage hypertension without throwing your kidneys under the bus. So, keep your fingers crossed – or better yet, keep your kidneys in check while we wait for science to save the day!\nNow, let’s not forget the elephant in the room: hypertension is not a laughing matter. Simply tossing out these medications would lead to dire consequences, like heart attacks and strokes – and while you might get a round of applause for unintentional comedy, it’s not the show you want to deliver. So, listen to your doctors and stay vigilant.\nWhat Should You Monitor? For those currently on antihypertensive meds, being proactive is key. Keep an eye out for symptoms like decreased urination, swelling in the legs , and, heaven forbid, seizures. Nobody wants a surprise party where your kidneys decide to go rogue – trust me, that’s a party you definitely want to avoid!\nIn Conclusion In the riveting world of antihypertensive drugs and their effects on kidneys, one must tread carefully. What at first seems like a simple aid for high blood pressure might just be a ticking time bomb for kidney function. So, hang tight, keep laughing, and let’s hope the researchers cut the drama and find a resolution before we’re all left with a kidney-shaped hole in our lives!\nDisclaimer: Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication.

Joining us is ⁣Dr. Sarah Johnson,​ a nephrologist and lead​ researcher on a recent study published in *Circulation Research*.⁤ Dr. ​Johnson, thank you for being with us!\n** Dr. Johnson :** ​Thank you‌ for having me! I’m ‌excited to discuss these important⁤ findings.\n**Host:** Let’s dive right in. Your study ⁢indicates that certain antihypertensive drugs—specifically the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors—can reprogram the kidneys ⁤in a way⁣ that ​jeopardizes their primary functions. Can you explain​ this⁢ phenomenon?\n**Dr. Johnson:** Absolutely. Our research highlighted that while these⁣ drugs effectively‌ lower blood pressure, they⁤ can inadvertently cause the kidneys to shift focus from⁤ their essential roles—like filtering blood and regulating electrolyte ⁢balance—to adopting a pathological state. We describe this transformation as the kidneys becoming a “neuro-immune endocrine organ pathological.”\n**Host:** That sounds incredibly concerning! What exactly happens to the kidney cells during this transformation?\n**Dr. ⁢Johnson:** The renin-producing cells in‍ the kidneys become excessively stimulated. This overactivity leads to ⁣an​ increase in renin production, which can cause nerve endings to overgrow and the cells lining the ​blood vessels in the ‌kidneys ​to⁢ expand, resulting in inflammation. Essentially, instead of‍ “working out” to improve ​filtering capabilities, these cells bulk⁣ up in a harmful manner.\n**Host:** So, it seems​ that while patients are managing ‌their blood pressure, they might unknowingly be⁤ putting their kidney function at risk. What do you recommend⁣ for patients currently on these ​medications?\n**Dr. Johnson:**⁤ It’s crucial that patients remain vigilant. While they shouldn’t stop taking their antihypertensive medications without consulting their‌ healthcare provider—since untreated hypertension poses serious health risks like⁣ heart attacks and strokes—they should monitor for possible symptoms. ⁢These symptoms include decreased urination, leg swelling, and even seizures.\n**Host:** Is there a​ silver lining⁤ to your findings?⁤ Could these insights lead to better treatment options in the future?\n**Dr. Johnson:** Yes, indeed!‍ The good news is ​that by‍ elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to pave the way for the development of new antihypertensive medications that can⁢ lower blood pressure effectively without adverse effects ‌on kidney function. Continued research is vital to find solutions that uphold both heart health and kidney integrity.\n**Host:** That’s reassuring to hear! Thank you, Dr. Johnson, for shedding light on ⁣this critical issue‌ affecting so many individuals.\n**Dr. Johnson:** Thank you for having me! It’s been a pleasure discussing this important research.\n**Host:** And thank you to our ‌audience for tuning in. Remember, it’s essential to stay informed about your health and ⁤consult your healthcare providers regularly. Until next time!",

    "title": "Treating cervicogenic headaches with dry needling and manual therapy",
    "text": "Cervicogenic headache refers to a headache of cervical origin.1 The International Headache Society (IHS) has classified headaches as primary, where there is no other causative factor, or secondary, where the headache occurs in close temporal relationship to another disorder to which it is attributed.2\nA cervicogenic headache is a secondary headache caused by a cervical spine disorder and its component bone, nerve/nerve root disc, and/or soft tissue elements.1,3–5 It is expected to have referred pain perceived in the head from a source in the neck.1,6,7 People with cervicogenic headaches often have reduced range of motion in their neck and worsen their headaches with specific movements of their neck or pressure applied to certain spots on their neck. The headaches are often side-locked (on one side only), and the pain may radiate from the neck/back of the head up to the front of the head or behind the eye.3,4,6 The headache may or may not be associated with neck pain. Diagnostic criteria have been established for cervicogenic headache, but its presenting characteristics may be difficult to distinguish from other headaches, such as migraine or tension-type headache.3\nDry needling and acupuncture\nDry needling and acupuncture are both techniques involving the insertion of thin needles into the body for therapeutic purposes. However, they have different origins, philosophies and intended outcomes. Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine, and acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years. Dry needling (also known as Western medical acupuncture) primarily uses a Western medicine philosophy grounded in anatomy and physiology and focuses on musculoskeletal issues.\nThere are overlaps and similarities in the two. Both involve the use of thin, sterile needles. Both are used as modalities for pain relief and improving bodily function. Both require skilled practitioners for safe and effective use, though practitioner training and certification differ. The difference is primarily philosophical. Acupuncture aims to restore health and balance by stimulating specific points along the meridians. In contrast, dry needling focuses on an anatomic basis to treat musculoskeletal conditions and aid in physical rehabilitation.8\nThe following literature review provides literature on both dry needling and acupuncture.\nTreatment of cervicogenic headaches via dry needling\nA systematic review has investigated the effectiveness of dry needling and conventional physiotherapy in managing cervicogenic headaches or tension-type headaches.9 Two included clinical trials with tension-type headache participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements following dry needling.9 Furthermore, one case report study with a cervicogenic headache female that was included in the systematic review showed significant improvement in pain and neck disability index after nine treatment sessions of dry needling combined with manual therapy.9 Since that review, another article explored superficial and deep dry needling to treat cervicogenic headache.10 The study’s results demonstrate the application of dry needling of suboccipital and upper trapezius muscles induces a significant improvement in headache symptoms, functional rating index and range of motion in patients with cervicogenic headaches. Additionally, they found deep dry needling had greater effects on cervical range of motion and function.10\nThe acupuncture literature provides further evidence for the use of dry needling for the treatment of headaches. A systematic review of the literature investigated whether acupuncture is more effective than routine care, “sham” acupuncture and other interventions in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headaches. The results indicated that acupuncture is effective for treating frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches, but further trials, particularly comparing acupuncture with other treatment options, such as physical therapy, massage or exercise, are needed.11 In another systematic review, the authors assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing headache frequency in patients with migraine. The results showed consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to the treatment of acute migraine attacks only or routine care.12\nThe authors also suggested that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment and has fewer adverse effects.12 They concluded that acupuncture should be considered a treatment option for patients with migraine willing to undergo this treatment.12\nRecently, authors in the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the effects of acupuncture on preventing tension-type headaches.13 After searching for all relevant studies, they identified two studies comparing acupuncture to usual care, four studies comparing acupuncture to physiotherapy, massage or exercise treatment and seven studies comparing acupuncture to a sham (placebo) acupuncture treatment. They concluded that based on this evidence, people with frequent tension-type headaches will probably have slightly fewer headaches three to four months after beginning a course of acupuncture. Specifically, people will probably have fewer “headache days” per month, and probably more people will have half as many headaches.13\nTreatment of cervicogenic headaches via manipulation\nManual therapy can be very effective in conjunction with dry needling in treating cervicogenic headaches.14,15 The primary focus of manual therapy is to restore normal arthrokinematics of the cervical region, with special attention paid to the upper cervical spine. For this discussion, we will define the upper cervical spine as the atlantooccipital joint, the axio-atlantal joint and the joints of the C2-3 segment. Restoring the function of these segments is paramount in finding a lasting solution to cervicogenic headaches.\nA likely symptom generator can be an excessive extension of the occiput on the atlas in functional postures. This compromises the suboccipital space and can result in compression forces acting on the structures found in the suboccipital space. The most notable structures in question are the greater and lesser occipital nerves. These nerves can be part of the cause for the typical cervicogenic pain pattern radiating from the posterior aspect of the neck around the lateral aspect of the head just above the ear and terminating above the eyes. This is often termed a “ram’s horn” presentation. A common posture like “forward head posture,” where the occiput tends to rotate posteriorly on the atlas, often results in soft tissue and joint dysfunction that can be treated with manual therapy.\nThe research shows that with competent hands, manual therapy can be a very effective treatment modality for cervicogenic headaches by improving the function of the upper cervical spine. One randomized controlled trial found that manual therapy effectively improved upper cervical mobility and provided immediate headache relief in patients with cervicogenic headaches.14 Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that improving C1-2 mobility via mobilizations reduced symptoms by 54% in individuals with cervicogenic headaches.15 A randomized controlled trial of manual therapy in combination with exercise therapy found that manual therapy and exercise therapy were both effective in reducing headache symptoms, with a combination of the two being the most effective treatment. This approach demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in headache frequency and intensity sustained at the 12-month follow-up assessment.17 One pilot study of patients with cervicogenic headaches showed that addressing primary passive trigger points via manual therapy improved cervical range of motion and deep neck flexor function and reduced the presence of primary passive trigger points.16\nFinal thoughts: Combined treatment of cervicogenic headaches\nThe research supports that dry needling and manual therapy are proven techniques in treating cervicogenic headaches.9,10,13,15,16 Both techniques can stand alone as effective approaches; however, their combination can be far superior in addressing cervicogenic headaches because of their unique and distinct target tissues.18 Dry needling targets soft tissue, while manual therapy can be utilized to target joint dysfunction. Dry needling is an excellent way to make manual therapy more effective and comfortable for the patient.\nBRIAN V.

    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "text": "Linux is well-known for its efficiency and ability to run on some very tiny hardware platforms. Its versatility has made it the go-to operating system for a wide range of devices, from smartphones and tablets to embedded systems and Internet of Things devices. This adaptability stems from its open-source nature, which allows developers to tailor it to suit the specific requirements of various hardware configurations.\nBut just how tiny and inexpensive of a hardware platform can you get your own useful Linux system up and running on? Many people would probably answer that question by pointing to the diminutive Raspberry Pi Zero, or a similar single board computer. For about ten dollars, and in a package the size of a stick of chewing gum, that would seem like a pretty good answer, even though Linux could run on an even less powerful platform. But that is not really what I had in mind in asking the question about getting your own useful Linux system up and running.\nA software engineer by the name of Uros Popovic recently spent some time trying to build a minimal, yet practical, Linux computer completely from scratch, with the goal of keeping the cost under five dollars. Popovic had previously gone through a similar exercise, but did all of the work in a virtual environment. This time the plan was to get mainline Linux running on a custom, physical computer. And lucky for us, the entire project was written-up in detail so that we can play along at home. Be warned that this is not a step-by-step tutorial, however, so you will need to bring some knowledge to the table if you want to recreate the device for yourself.\nThe system is built around the Allwinner F1C100S SoC, which provides processing, memory, and USB and UART peripherals all in one package. That was paired with an SPI NOR flash memory chip to provide permanent storage — about 8 to 16 megabytes of space is sufficient. In single quantities, these components can be purchased for about five dollars. Popovic followed another engineer’s tutorial to create a PCB with these components, and then had it manufactured with JLCPCB.\nThroughout the remainder of the write-up, Popovic gives lots of helpful tips on how to build the bootloader, compile the Linux kernel, and initialize the filesystem. Finally, some steps are given to get the system up and running for the first time. Popovic also notes that a LicheePi Nano board, or similar, can be substituted by anyone that wants to build the Linux system without worrying about the custom hardware.\nFor some people, an exercise like this is a great way to spend a weekend. If that is you, you will not want to skip out on reading the write-up . On the other hand, if this sounds more like a nightmare to you, well, there is always the Raspberry Pi Zero.\nlinux pcb Nick Bild Follow R&D, creativity, and building the next big thing you never knew you wanted are my specialties.",

    "text": "The quickest way to freshen up your look for the new year is a string of pearls READ MORE: Why I won't listen to ANY shop assistant in 2024...\nThese are the days to sort your everyday underpinnings: the unseen ones (bras and pants), the half-seen ones (tights and layering tops) — or you could skip those and go straight to your essential 24/7 jewellery.\nBrace for what I’m about to say. The quickest way to freshen up your look for the new year, your guaranteed skin-enhancing, illuminating spritz of prettiness on a gloomy January day, and for all the days ahead, is a simple string of pearls.\nDoesn’t sound like you? That’s because you’re thinking 1980s pearls: fat chokers made of blueberry-sized creamy pearls; long flapper ropes of pearls wrapped around your neck and then knotted; or the single strand of perfectly spherical graded pearls that the late Queen always wore.\nYou’re picturing Dressing Up pearls, whereas the pearls we’re going to be wearing are everyday with everything — the equivalent of a gold chain or a pair of gold hoop earrings, and roughly the same price.\nThey may even cost nothing, since if you’re over 55 there’s a good chance you have some pearls tucked away in a drawer. And if you’re younger, your mum probably does.\nRihanna has perfected the layered look, wearing her pearls together with a number of longer chains\nI recently asked a twenty-something shop assistant where her pearls were from (a short necklace nestled above a few chains and pendants) and she answered bashfully: ‘Oh, they’re my mum’s. She’s not happy I’ve pinched them!’\nAnd that nicely sums up the new position of pearls. Twelve months ago, her mum couldn’t have cared less if her daughter had pinched her pearls. Last year, pearls were for the kids to layer, boys included.\nBut now pearl necklaces are like colourful Gazelle suede trainers — great whatever your age, and the detail that makes you look a bit in-the-know.\nPearls are flattering, too, somehow lighting up your face, which is probably the reason pearl drop earrings have been the hottest jewellery item of the past couple of years.\nThe smaller the pearls, the better they are for stacking with pendants and chains. The bigger and more symmetrical they are, the more old-fashioned they’ll look.\nSoft white pearls are the ones having a moment, not the deep cream ones which can look like something rented from the theatrical outfitters. Likewise, avoid bright white: it looks too fake and doesn’t flatter skin in the same way.\nIf you can’t find any at the back of the drawer, you can now buy pearls at any price practically anywhere on the High Street, from John Lewis’s classic freshwater pearls (£115, johnlewis.co.uk) to Jon Richard’s natural seed pearl necklace (£22, johnlewis.co.uk) and Accessorize’s seed pearls (£20, accessorize.com).\nOn trend mid-market jewellery shops such as Mejuri have whole sections devoted to pearl jewellery. Its Tiny Pearl necklace (£98, mejuri.com) is designed to lie just above the collarbone so it’s always visible, even above the neckline of a round-neck sweater.\nActress Cate Blanchett wore layered pearl necklaces over a black Maison Margiela gown to the British Academy Film Awards last year\nOther places to look for quality freshwater pearl necklaces include Missoma (missoma.com) and Astrid and Miyu (astridandmiyu.com).\nMeanwhile, & Other Stories does a delicate 15-inch pearl necklace (£35, stories.com) with an extension chain. A bit of chain in the mix is all to the good. These new pearls are not traditional or ‘for best’, so ringing the changes can work.\nIf you are mixing up your pearls — and I prefer them this way — & Other Stories has a half chain, half two-strand organic-shaped pearl necklace (£35) or a single pearl strand interspersed with a few flat, gold-toned beads (£29).\nMoving up the price scale, I like Monica Vinader’s mini gold nugget and pearl beaded necklace (£125, monica-vinader.com). It’s adjustable between 16 and 18 inches, so you can wear it just on your collarbone or lower.\nDon’t be tempted to go for coloured stones or crystal and pearl combinations. That’s too flash. The more dressy and polished looking the pearls, the less useful they are — though that is not to say there isn’t a place for them.\nI recently saw a woman wearing a long rope of organic (irregular shaped) pearls over a plain dress. Could catch on. Who knows, by the summer this might be our new neck protector for weddings.\nSomething to remember: either wear a pearl necklace or pearl drop earrings, but not both together. And pearls always look better against the skin — don’t wear your necklace on top of your polo neck.",
