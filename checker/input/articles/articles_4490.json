    "text": "Rate of stroke deaths among middle-age US adults hit two-decade high during COVID pandemic, report shows\nMiddle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nVideo above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokes\nAfter at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group.\nStroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier\nresearch has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages.\nBut the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report.\nAlso, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people.\nMiddle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report.\nIn 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group.\nExperts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.\n\"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications.\n\"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\"\nStroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors.\nBut it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say.\nStrokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help.\n\"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",

    "text": "La Protezione Civile della Regione Campania, a seguito delle valutazioni del Centro Funzionale, ha emanato una allerta meteo per temporali di livello Giallo. Dalle 9 di domani, sabato 14 dicembre, alle 9 di dopodomani, domenica 15 dicembre, è previsto l'arrivo di una nuova perturbazione con precipitazioni intense sulla gran parte del territorio e un rischio idrogeologico localizzato.\nQueste le zone interessate: 1 (Piana Campana, Napoli, Isole, Area Vesuviana); 2 (Alto Volturno e Matese), 3 (Penisola Sorrentino-Amalfitana, Monti di Sarno e Monti Picentini); 5 (Tusciano e Alto Sele); 6 (Piana Sele e Alto Cilento); 8 (Basso Cilento). Saranno possibili allagamenti, esondazioni, ruscellamenti, innalzamento dei livelli idrometrici dei corsi d'acqua, caduta massi e frane in considerazione della fragilità dei territori. A causa della saturazione dei suoli saranno possibili frane e caduta massi anche in assenza di nuove precipitazioni. Si ricorda ai Sindaci di tutta la Campania di attivare i Centri Operativi Comunali (COC), di attuare tutte le misure previste dai rispettivi piani di protezione civile.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",

    "text": "( MENAFN ) A Palestinian priest expressed that this Christmas will be a “very sad” occasion, given that 3 percent of the Christian community in the Gaza Strip has lost their lives in the continuous Israeli assaults on the besieged Palestinian enclave since October 7.\nIn an interview with a US-based news outlet, Mitri Raheb, the head of Dar al-Kalima University, declared: “I don’t think in my entire life I experienced so much sadness, but also so much anger about what’s happening in Gaza.”\n“I fear that this is the end of the Christian presence in Gaza. And, you know, the Christian presence in Gaza is a 2,000-years-old presence,” he continued.\nRaheb pointed out that Christmas celebrations have been called off in Bethlehem.\n“You don't have Christmas lights. you don't have (a) Christmas tree in Bethlehem. There are no tourists coming because of the war,” he stated.\n“Here in the West Bank, we are experiencing apartheid colonization by Jewish settlers,” Raheb further mentioned.\n“I find it really a shame that in this season, where every church hears these words, ‘peace on Earth,’ that the United States is vetoing even a cease-fire. It’s a shame,” the priest noted.\nHe highlighted that over 8,000 children in Gaza have lost their lives since October 7.\nFollowing the October 7 attack by Hamas, Israel has relentlessly targeted the Gaza Strip, resulting in the reported deaths of at least 20,057 Palestinians, predominantly women and children. Additionally, health authorities in the besieged enclave have documented injuries to 53,320 others.\nMENAFN24122023000045015839ID1107652635\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.
