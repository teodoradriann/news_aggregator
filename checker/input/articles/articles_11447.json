    "title": "Patrick Williams sidelined for 2 weeks - putting the Chicago Bulls at a steep size disadvantage",
    "text": "Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams will not play for the next two weeks after receiving a platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection in his right knee, the team announced Thursday.\nWilliams suffered a knee-to-knee collision with a Detroit Pistons player on Feb. 12 in the final game before the All-Star break. After taking the break to recover, Williams participated fully in practice Tuesday and Wednesday. But he experienced discomfort after Wednesday’s practice, leading to the decision to undergo injection treatment.\nA PRP injection in a knee is a fairly standard procedure for NBA players that aims to enhance healing and reduce inflammation. The Bulls medical team will reevaluate Williams in two weeks, although he is not guaranteed to return at that time. The timeline means Williams will miss at least eight of the Bulls’ final 27 regular-season games.\nInjuries have nagged the 23-year-old Williams throughout his five NBA seasons. He played only 17 games in his second season after undergoing wrist surgery, and he missed almost half of last season with a left foot injury that ultimately required surgery. Williams already missed 10 games this season because of lingering discomfort in that foot.\nWilliams is averaging 9.1 points and four rebounds this season. He showed some improvement when moved out of the starting lineup at the end of January, averaging 9.2 points and 4.8 rebounds over nine games despite playing two fewer minutes per game.\nThe Bulls now enter the final stretch of the season at a steep size disadvantage. Small ball already had become the status quo for the Bulls, who have relied on speed and high-volume 3-point shooting to try to offset their smaller rotations.\nWithout Williams, the Bulls will rely on their three youngest players to fill in at power forward: rookie Matas Buzelis, 20; second-year pro Julian Phillips, 21; and third-year pro Dalen Terry, 22. Buzelis already had stepped into Williams’ starting role for the last four games before the All-Star break, a position he likely will fill for the remainder of the season.",

    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services\nSince 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms.\nEnet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem.\nHolding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations.\nEnet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

    "text": "Since the images first leaked online, the Kuronami bundle has become one of VALORANT’s most anticipated skin bundles. The bundle appeals to those who fantasize about being a ninja assassin, and the skins feature some of the flashiest and most stylish animations.\nThe first major bundle release of 2024 is surely going to keep alive the trend of players emptying their bank accounts upon a new skin bundle drop.\nVALORANT Kuronami skins and prices The Kuronami bundle will feature skins for the Marshal, Sheriff, Spectre, and Vandal . The bundle will also feature a melee item that is a dual set of chained ninja daggers, as well as two gun buddies, a spray, and player cards.\nMarshal. Image via Riot Games Daggers. Image via Riot Games Sheriff. Image via Riot Games Spectre. Image via Riot Games Vanda with gun buddy. Image via Riot Games The Kuronami weapon skins and the melee skin feature three additional color variants and animation upgrades that can be acquired with Radianite. The gun skins also feature a sound effect and a weather-changing finisher upgrade.\nKuronami finisher The Kuronami skins are inspired by several different franchises, including “Shen from [ LoL ], Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow from GI Joe , Scorpion and Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat ,” according to art direction senior manager Kerzin Atienza. Iconic anime Naruto is referenced via the water-based magic seen in the animations, and the “dark/edgy vibe” takes notes from a previous VALORANT skin line: Reaver .\nA full display of the Kuronami melee animations The full bundle will cost 9,500 VALORANT points . You can only get the melee item if you purchase the entire bundle. While buying the bundle is the better value, you can purchase any of the individual Kuronami gun skins by themselves:\nVandal: 2,375 VP Spectre: 2,375 VP Marshal: 2,375 VP Sheriff: 2,375 VP VALORANT Kuronami release date The Kuronami bundle is expected to go live in the VALORANT store on Tuesday, Jan. 9 , alongside the launch of Episode Eight .

    "title": "Le aziende non investono su chi ha più di 55 anni - RSI",
    "text": "Tre quarti dei datori di lavoro in Svizzera si dicono disponibili ad assumere dipendenti di oltre 55 anni. In questa fascia d’età, che costituisce il 23% della popolazione attiva, avviene però solo l’8% di tutte le nuove assunzioni.\nLa sottorappresentazione dei dipendenti over 55 nei nuovi arrivi nelle aziende è probabilmente dovuta anche alla scarsa propensione di tali lavoratori a cambiare impiego, commentano gli specialisti della compagnia assicurativa Swiss Life in uno studio pubblicato giovedì e relativo alla politica delle risorse umane nei confronti degli impiegati più anziani. E le aziende stesse hanno poco interesse nel contribuire alla loro formazione continua. Che le aziende non facciano abbastanza “non è la parola giusta”, secondo Luigi Miriello dell’[associazione 50epiù](http://www.50etplus.ch/it/), che difende i diritti di questa categoria di persone. “C’è una specie di ignoranza di questo problema”, afferma, “che purtroppo esiste ancora. Bisogna lavorare per far capire che il potenziale della categoria degli ultracinquantenni è attuale”.\nLa ricerca evidenzia come siano bene integrati e come il tasso di disoccupazione sia inferiore ad altri Paesi. Ma in caso di perdita dell’impiego, fanno fatica a riciclarsi nonostante le buone intenzioni sbandierate dalle aziende. “In quel caso è un dramma, non solo lavorativo ma anche sociale”, sottolinea Miriello. Per tutelarli bisogna “prima di tutto essere coscienti di questo problema. E poi basta con questi discorsi che dopo i 50 anni uno non ha voglia di lavorare o non è formato: non è vero”.\n50epiù sostiene la soluzione dell’obbligo, che imporrebbe alle aziende di ingaggiare una quota minima di persone ormai nell’ultima fase della loro vita lavorativa. Ma questo “ovviamente non basta, serve un appoggio, un aiuto. Per esempio un finanziamento per la formazione”.\nLa situazione in Ticino è particolarmente difficile, “per me è ancora indietro”, sostiene Miriello.",

    "title": "Southwestern Energy's Q4 2023 Earnings: A Tale of Resilience and Adaptability",
    "text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of the energy sector, Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) stands on the cusp of revealing its financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023. With the energy industry's eyes turned towards them, SWN's anticipated disclosure on Thursday, February 22nd, 2024, marks a critical junction. This date, though not officially confirmed by the company, is projected based on historical reporting patterns. As a leading US producer and marketer of natural gas and natural gas liquids, Southwestern Energy has navigated through the tumultuous waters of the energy market to post an impressive annual revenue of $8.21 billion and a net income of $1.85 billion, translating to $4.64 earnings per share over the last four quarters.\nA Glimpse into the Future\nAs analysts pore over data and trends, the consensus points towards a year-over-year decline in earnings for the final quarter of 2023. However, the narrative does not end there. With an estimated Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.13, marking a significant 50% change from the prior year, and revenues expected to see a 55.3% decrease to $1.51 billion, the plot thickens. The Earnings ESP (Earnings Surprise Prediction) for Southwestern Energy stands at 1.59, a beacon indicating a potential positive surprise against consensus estimates. This figure paints a picture of resilience and adaptability, traits that have historically defined SWN, as evidenced by a 25% surprise in EPS in the last reported quarter.\nThe Chesapeake Merger: A New Chapter\nThe narrative of Southwestern Energy is further complicated by its pending merger with Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake). This strategic move is poised to redefine the contours of the energy market in the United States. As two giants in shale gas basins come together, the industry watches with bated breath. However, due to this significant transition, SWN has decided against hosting a conference call or webcast to discuss the Q4 results. This development adds a layer of intrigue and anticipation to the announcement, as stakeholders and market watchers are left to parse through the data on the company's website post-market close on the day of the report.\nLooking Ahead\nThe spotlight on Southwestern Energy's upcoming earnings report illuminates not just the company's financial health but also the broader dynamics at play in the energy sector. With earnings expected to grow from $0.62 per share to $0.74 per share in the upcoming year, representing a 19.35% increase, the trajectory of SWN is one of cautious optimism. In a world grappling with energy transitions and market volatilities, Southwestern Energy's movements are a microcosm of the larger shifts underfoot. As the company prepares to unveil its Q4 2023 financial results, the implications ripple outwards, foreshadowing trends and setting the stage for the future.\nAs we edge closer to February 22nd, all eyes will be on Southwestern Energy Company. With its significant revenue and net income, coupled with the strategic merger with Chesapeake, SWN stands at a pivotal point. The upcoming earnings report will not just shed light on the company’s performance but also signal the evolving dynamics of the energy sector at large. Amidst the challenges and opportunities, Southwestern Energy's journey is a testament to the resilience and adaptability required to navigate the complex energy landscape of today and tomorrow.",
