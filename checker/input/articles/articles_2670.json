    "text": "Gewerkschaft verkündet Tarifeinigung bei Dönerfabrik Birtat\nMehrere Tage ist bei der schwäbischen Dönerfabrik Birtat für bessere Bezahlung und einen Tarifvertrag gekämpft worden. Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",

    "text": "HYATTSVILLE, Md. (RNS) — “We are not an outreach project. We are the church,” Episcopal Bishop Daniel G.P. Gutiérrez of the Diocese of Pennsylvania told an audience of Latino Episcopalians as he gave a keynote address at the 2018 Nuevo Amanecer conference in Hendersonville, North Carolina.\nSix years later, Gutiérrez is one of five nominees to succeed Presiding Bishop Michael Curry. The election , which is scheduled for June 26 during the General Convention, will see the House of Bishops choose a new presiding bishop to serve a nine-year term leading the denomination.\nIf Gutiérrez is elected, he could become the highest-profile Latino leader of a U.S. religious group.\nRELATED: The Episcopal Church announces four candidates for presiding bishop Descended from New Mexican Hispanos and great-grandparents who emmigrated from Jalisco, Mexico, Gutiérrez, who previously worked in Albuquerque, New Mexico, politics, was raised Catholic, like 65% of U.S. Latinos.\nBut despite the Episcopal Church’s liturgical similarities to the Catholic Church, according to a 2014 Pew study , the Episcopal Church is among the least racially diverse religious groups in the U.S., with white people making up 90% of the denomination. In 2014, only 2% of the denomination was Latino.\nThat number has likely changed in the ensuing decade, especially with the Catholic Church experiencing steep losses in membership. Among U.S. Latinos, 23% are former Catholics — but only 9% of U.S. Latinos report switching to Protestantism, whereas 20% of U.S. Latinos who have left their childhood religion become unaffiliated, according to 2022 Pew data . Meanwhile, like other mainline Protestant churches, the Episcopal Church is experiencing a decline in overall members.\nRegardless of the big-picture numbers, Latino Episcopal clergy say their congregations are thriving.\nIn Hyattsville, Maryland, where a scratchy güira provided a cumbia beat to energetic worship music, about 400 people attended three different Spanish services on Pentecost Sunday (May 19) at St. Matthew’s/San Mateo Episcopal Church.\nThe Rev. Vidal Rivas said that, while San Mateo has yet to reach pre-pandemic Sunday attendance, the over 1,000 registered parishioners keep the church “very alive, very strong.”\nRivas, who told Religion News Service, “I love to work,” keeps himself and his congregation in constant motion with parish groups, special celebrations, service work, a radio station and community organizing and collaborations.\nCalling Jesus “an immigrant from the heavens” during the 5:00 p.m. service, Rivas told RNS that San Mateo emphasizes solidarity, regularly hosting several-dozen newly arrived immigrants in the church’s basement, participating in marches for immigrant rights and fighting for rent stabilization.\nRivas’ wife, Angela, who matches his intensity for ministry, said her husband’s dedication to meeting people’s needs and his openness have played a key role in San Mateo’s growth. “It doesn’t matter to him if they come to him from other churches for funerals. He preaches anyway and from there people stay.”\nThe Rev. Santiago “Santi” Rodriguez, associate rector at Grace Episcopal Church in Alexandria, Virginia, said Latinos often find the Episcopal Church when they reach out, “not fully understanding what that church was,” for help with a baptism, funeral or material need.\n“And then they were welcomed, they were cared for, they were loved, and then in time, they were invited to participate in a service as part of the larger community, and they felt right at home,” Rodriguez said.\nRodriguez, a former Jesuit, said Latinos also find the church when they are looking for “more inclusive, intentionally affirming communities.”\n“They felt they needed to be affirmed, to hear that they are God’s beloved children, that they are loved and accepted as they are, and they are always challenged to grow in their faith and to seek a relationship with Jesus and to be affirmed by the power of the Holy Spirit,” said Rodriguez.\nAngela Rivas, who, like many other Latinos interviewed, had previously been Catholic, said she liked becoming an Episcopalian because “they let you be yourself with your shortcomings. They don’t prohibit you from Communion,” adding that she also finds that she has more opportunities to work for the church. (Only 21% of Hispanic Catholics receive Communion at every Mass they attend, according to a 2015 Pew survey.)\nThe main reason unaffiliated Latinos give for leaving their faith, according to a 2023 PRRI survey , was no longer believing the religion’s teachings — but nearly the same number (58%) cited “negative teaching about or treatment of gay and lesbian people.”\nFor the Rev. Yuriria “Yuri” Rodriguez, currently serving at the Church of the Nativity in Indianapolis, becoming an Episcopalian “brought an empowerment that I did not experience when I was a child.”\nComing to interview at an Episcopal church for a director of music position without much prior knowledge of the church, she saw a woman preaching and a Pride flag outside the church. Rodriguez said, “I thought, ‘This is my place. I’ve always wanted to be in a place like this.’” (Yuri and Santi Rodriguez are not related.)\nThe Rev. Alejandra “Ale” Trillos, the rector of Saint Paul San Pablo Episcopal Church in Salinas, California, said that, having studied political science before her ordination, the Episcopal Church’s transparency about money and its election of bishops impressed her.\nRivas, who began his ministry as a Catholic priest in El Salvador, became an Episcopal priest after a dispute with former Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who later became the first Catholic cardinal laicized for the sexual abuse of children and adults.\nRivas said McCarrick had accused him of being “like a communist” and tried to transfer him back to El Salvador, which Rivas had left after facing targeted violent assaults. At the time, the archdiocese told The Washington Post that the transfer was routine.\nDetermined to continue serving D.C.’s Salvadoran community, who rallied behind him by protesting outside the archdiocesan offices and organizing letter-writing campaigns, Rivas left the Catholic church, underwent the process of becoming an Episcopal priest and married Angela.\nYet, despite finding a home in the Episcopal Church, Latino clergy said there are multiple barriers to full participation and belonging.",
