    "text": "FútbolUy. Seguinos en Twitter [@futbolportaluy](https://twitter.com/futbolportaluy) Un nuevo enfrentamiento entre una hinchada y la policía se dio en tierras brasileñas, en este caso con los parciales tricolores que llegaron al Morumbi para alentar a su equipo en el duelo de vuelta de octavos de final de Copa Libertadores. Los primeros incidentes se dieron apenas finalizada la primera etapa donde la aparición de una bengala en el sector donde estaban alojados los cerca de 1500 simpatizantes del equipo uruguayo comenzó a generar la movilización de los efectivos. Eso determinó una primera incomodidad que se terminó de descontrolar al inicio del complemento y tras el segundo tanto local, anotado por Jonathan Calleri a los 47’. Allí el partido se vio detenido ya que la policía comenzó a reprimir a los hinchas, muchos de los cuales se refugiaron en los túneles de acceso, mientras que otros rompían las butacas plásticas para usarlas como proyectiles sobre estos. Fueron unos seis minutos de muchísima tensión hasta que todo bajó de revoluciones y la pelota pudo volver a rodar, pero en un clima teñido de nerviosismo hasta el cierre.

    "text": "ELLIJAY, GA, USA, December 28, 2023 /EINPresswire.com/ -- fluidIQ, a MedTech company developing fluidics-based respiratory solutions, reflects on its 2023 accomplishments while looking forward to achieving initial commercialization in 2024. The year marked advances for the company, its technology and related research and positioned it in front of important audiences â including at major medical conferences, investor meetings and in presentations to government agencies. Award-Winning Innovation fluidIQ received an award from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and was invited to join the respected group. âfluidIQ was honored to receive the prestigious MTEC Innovation Award and is proud to now be an active member of MTEC,â said Matt Vogelhuber, R.Ph., Chief Executive Officer of fluidIQ. MTEC is a public-private partnership that is authorized to serve by the Department of Defense to promote the development and delivery of innovative medical technologies to improve the health and safety of military personnel, veterans and civilians. fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ was created by emergency medical and respiratory professionals working with world-class engineers to provide resuscitation and emergency breathing without reliance on traditional manual techniques and tools; recent NIH-supported study findings suggest improved techniques for rescue breathing could save more lives. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-finds-poor-ventilation-use-during-cpr-out-hospital-cardiac-arrest#:~:text=The%20ventilation%20technique%2C%20also%20known,rates%2C%20according%20to%20a%20study Providing benefits of automation without the need for electricity or batteries, HOPE inVentâ¢ harnesses the science of fluidics -- uses air or fluids to operate things automatically -- to provide breathing support to patients who are unable to breathe on their own. Presenting Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) invited fluidIQ to conduct a TechWatch presentation to multiple government departments and agencies earlier this year. BARDA promotes the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect Americans and respond to 21st Century health security threats. fluidIQ researchers were invited to present at both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) meetings to share findings of international research efforts featuring the companyâs HOPE inVentâ¢ technology. fluidIQ was also chosen to present at the Respiratory Innovation Summit (RIS), hosted by the American Thoracic Society, a meeting that historically attracts 275+ global leaders representing all facets of the respiratory industry, including representatives from startups, business development, venture capital, government, academia and clinical medicine. Partnering Meanwhile, fluidIQ continued its collaborative research agreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, a collaboration that will soon be in its fourth year. The NIH expects to conduct a first-in-humans study early in 2024. Late last year, the NIH research with fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ device was published in Science Translational Medicine. In addition, the NIH Directorâs blog featured the technology: (https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2022/11/29/clinical-center-doctors-testing-3d-printed-miniature-ventilator/) and included details about the technology on its website (https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/creating-easy-use-portable-ventilator.) fluidIQ celebrated its second year partnering with Intersurgical U.S. (previously known as Pulmodyne) further developing fluidIQâs pipeline of respiratory products. fluidIQ is proud to be an active member of Securing Americaâs Medicines and Supply (SAMS), a multi-industry coalition of companies with the mission to strengthen the security of the medical supply chain in the United States. https://samscoalition.org The companyâs tiny three-inch-tall resuscitator/ventilator was highlighted at a national competition by partner, Diversified Plastics, Inc., that presented fluidIQâs HOPE inVentâ¢ to Additive Manufacturing User Groupâs (AMUG) Technical Competition under the title âHOPE inVentâ¢ fluidIQ: The New Era of Emergency Resuscitation.â [see video of device in operation on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amug_amug-amugtechcomp-amug2024-activity-7137824586582167553-54FC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios] Positioning Nearly four years since its founding, fluidIQ is well-positioned for another year of progress and momentum. âWe continue to gain momentum and achieve milestones even in what has been a tumultuous time for many startups,â said Vogelhuber. âOur team looks back at 2023 with a sense of accomplishment and looks forward with much anticipation and excitement to 2024.â The companyâs first medical device, HOPE inVentâ¢ was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) via a DeNovo application in the spring of this year and is currently under review. The company is working towards reaching commercialization in the emergency medicine including patient transport following clearance. Preparing Meanwhile, the fluidIQ team is preparing for its first commercial market for its veterinary HOPE inVentâ¢ device in 2024 and is exploring partnership opportunities in the multi-billion-dollar space. About fluidIQ fluidIQ, a public benefit and Delaware corporation, provides simple yet elegant solutions based on proprietary fluidics technology. The company was founded by a group of doctors, engineers and patient advocates who joined together to find solutions for gaps in medical needs, including ventilators, in the midst of the 2020 world medical crisis. fluidIQ aims to deliver hope to a world in need with simple, easy-to-deploy technology solutions that solve the most pressing medical challenges of our time. fluidIQâs roadmap for an entire family of products is based on fluidics-operated devices dedicated to filling gaps in emergency and preparedness protocols that are user-friendly, scalable and cost-effective.

    "title": "First Look: The Cool Datsun-Themed Seiko Prospex Speedtimer Limited Edition Collection",
    "text": "What defines something as an icon is generally down to the public’s perspective of its significance. It can be anything, really, as long as it stands for something extraordinary. In watchmaking, we have a fair few of them that we regularly celebrate. Think of watches like the Seiko Speedtimer 6139 , which was among the very first automatic chronograph watches. Born in 1969, it lives on today in the Prospex Speedtimer collection . And now, crossing over into automotive celebrations, the collection expands with not one, but three themed limited edition Seikos honouring another Japanese icon of the same year; the mighty Datsun 240Z rally car !\nThe Seiko-Datsun connection The connection between Seiko and Datsun, the Japanese car manufacturer, isn’t as far-fetched as it might seem. Both are Japanese, of course, but there’s more to it than that. The name Datsun was introduced by the DAT Motorcar Company in 1931 to indicate smaller production vehicles. By 1986, the name was phased out by its parent company Nissan , to form a global single-name brand. One of the most iconic cars by Datsun is the 240Z, in production from 1969 to 1978, which was very popular in Japan and the US for its striking good looks, mechanical reliability. It was also quite successful in motorsports, both on and off road, as it won the gruelling 6,200km-long East Africa Safari Rally in 1971.\nAd – Scroll to continue with article At that time, Seiko actively supported Datsun/Nissan in their racing and rallying programs, and as such, the winning No. 11 car bore the famous Seiko name when it finished first in said rally. That very achievement is now honoured in a fittingly themed series of watches, that also introduces a completely new model to the Prospec Speedtimer range, as well as updating its sporty Speedtimer Chronograph in the process! But before we go into details on the permanently available models, we kick off the celebrations of that iconic car-and-watch connection, with the Datsun 240Z inspired SPB517 (time-and-date), SRQ057 (mechanical chronograph) and SSC957 (solar chronograph) trilogy!\nSeiko Prospex Speedtimer Mechanical Datsun 240Z L.E. SPB517 New to the Prospex Speedtimer collection is a time-and-date model, which makes its debut as part of this Datsun-themed trilogy, but also as a stand-alone reference in the permanent collection (more on that later today!). It keeps in check with the overall Speedtimer aesthetics, but presents itself as a simpler, cleaner version of the sporty timekeeper. This Datsun 240Z Limited Edition SPB517 kicks things off with a rather stylish stainless steel case measuring a pleasant 39.5mm across and 12.0mm in height. On the right, the crown is joined by a secondary one to operate the inner rotating bezel that serves as a countdown timer.\nThe dial is fittingly finished in black, with the classical Datsun logo proudly visible in the bottom half of it. The large markers and hands make telling time quite easy, and each one gets a touch of LumiBrite for extra night-time legibility. On the outer edge, the rotating inner bezel has a scale divided into red and grey quarters, with vintage font numerals to countdown the start to a race (or any other event of your choosing). Between the 4 and 5 o’clock marker, you can see the date poking through, with a horizontally aligned digit.\nCovered by a solid stainless steel caseback emblazoned with the Datsun logo, is Seiko’s Calibre 6R55 . This in-house automatic ticks at a frequency of 21,600vph and has a generous power reserve of 72 hours. It’s fitted to a perforated black leather strap with a red backing and lining, and a folding clasp. Limited to 2,500 pieces, this special Datsun 240Z edition will cost you EUR 1,250 .\nQuick Facts – 39.5mm x 12.0mm – stainless steel case, brushed & polished – superhard coating – dual crowns (setting & winding, inner countdown bezel) – curved sapphire crystal with AR-coating – solid caseback with Datsun logo – black dial – applied markers & hands with LumiBrite – vintage Datsun logo – rotating countdown bezel with vintage font & quartered sections – Calirbe 6R55, in-house automatic – 21,600ph – 72h power reserve – perforated black leather strap with red backing & lining – folding clasp – limited to 2,500 pieces – EUR 1,250\nSeiko Prospex Speedtimer Mechanical Chronograph Datsun 240Z L.E. SRQ057 Next in line is an adaptation of the Prospex Speedtimer as we know it. Although it’s quite similar to the SRQ047 through SRQ053 that came before it, a few details set it apart from the rest. The most obvious change, apart from the black coated stainless steel case, is the fixed external tachymeter bezel. This used to be an internal one, but has now been moved to the outside for that classical racing chronograph look. While the case dimensions are similar, at 42mm in width and 14.6mm in height, it looks a bit smaller thanks to its black finish (black is slimming, as they say!). The bezel itself is fitted with a black insert that presents its scale in white and red, in correlation to the Datsun 240Z that inspired the series.\nThe dial is, unsurprisingly, I guess, black! This strongly contrasts with the large, steel coloured markers and faceted hour and minute hands, white printed scales and numerals on the sloped inner flange, the minute track, the subdials and so on. The chronograph indications all get a touch of red on the hands, while the running seconds hand has received a blue stripe. A bevelled window at 04:30 reveals the date, and LumiBrite on the markers and hands glow in the dark. The finishing touch is the cursive ‘Datsun’ script below the logo at noon.\nBeating away under the hood is Seiko’s 8R48 automatic column-wheel chronograph movement . This has a ‘rev limit’ (pardon the pun, I mean frequency of course!) of 28,800vph and can hold up to 45 hours of power. The column-wheel and vertical clutch ensure a smooth start, stop and reset action of the stopwatch function, which is done through the pump-style pushers on either side of the crown.\nWorn on a black calfskin leather strap with a three-fold stainless steel clasp, the SRQ057 is limited to 500 pieces only! The price is set at EUR 3,500 , slightly more than its permanently available steel-and-black sibling also launching today (which we’ll cover later today!)\nQuick Facts – 42.0mm x 14.6mm – stainless steel case, brushed & polished – black hardcoating – black crown & pushers – black fixed tachymeter scale with white & red scale – curved sapphire crystal with AR-coating – solid caseback with Datsun logo – applied markers & hands with LumiBrite – red-tipped chronograph hands – blue-tipped runnig seconds hand – bevelled date window – Calibre 8R48, in-house – automatic chronograph – 28,800vph – 48h power reserve – column-wheel & vertical clutch – black leather strap with three-fold steel clasp – limited to 500 pieces – EUR 3,500\nSeiko Prospex Speedtimer Solar Chronograph Datsun 240Z L.E. SSC957 The third model in the series is a Solar-powered version of the Prospex Speedtimer Chronograph. This follows along the same path as the others, with references to the iconic red colour of the 240Z rally cars on the dial, hands and bezel. The stainless steel case comes in at 41.4mm by 13.0mm, which means it’s slightly more compact than its mechanical counterpart, which should be noticeable on the wrist. It uses the Calibre V192, which charges through a solar cell over the dial and can store up to 6 months of power in its battery. The subdial at 6′ doubles as a power reserve indicator, which is convenient. Worn on a stainless steel bracelet with black mid-links, it’s limited to 4,000 pieces and retails for EUR 1,050 .\nQuick Facts – 41.4mm x 13.0mm – stainless steel case, brushed & polished – black pushers & crown – fixed black tachymeter bezel with white & red scale – curved sapphire crystal with AR-coating – solid caseback with Datsun 240Z silhouette – 100m water-resistant – black dial – applied markers & hands with LumiBrite – subdials for small seconds at 9′, 24-hours at 3′, and chronograph 60-minutes with power reserve at 6′ – Calibre V192, solar-powered – 6-month maximum charge – over-charging protection – stainless steel bracelet with black mid-links & folding clasp – limited to 4,000 pieces – EUR 1,050\nFor more information, please visit Seiko-Watches.com .",

    "text": "Saint-Gérand-le-Puy. Concert de Noël à l’église Saint-Julien. La population et les musiciens de la Société musicale du village étaient heureux de retrouver le cadre de l’église Saint-Julien pour le traditionnel concert de Noël.\nLe dernier en date remontait à 2019 puisqu’en 2020 et 2021 ils n’avaient pas eu lieu en raison de la pandémie de Covid-19 et qu’en 2022, il s’était tenu à la salle socioculturelle.\nPlus de quatre-vingts personnes sont venues écouter le répertoire de saison offert par vingt-trois musiciens en grande forme. Des traditionnels airs de Marius Millot aux marches de Disney, en passant par un étonnant Boléro de Noël d’Éric Osterling, mêlant le Boléro de Ravel à L’Enfant au tambour interprété avec brio par les musiciens, tout comme Le temps des cathédrales de la célèbre comédie musicale Notre-Dame de Paris.\nLe public a été comblé par cette grande variété de styles. Il en a redemandé et, comme au concert du Nouvel an à Vienne, c’est la Marche de Radetzky de Johann Strauss, brillamment interprétée, qui est venue clore ce moment musical.\nCette soirée s’est achevée en toute convivialité autour d’une boisson chaude et de pâtisseries.",

    "text": "If you missed the coverage of the Archbishop’s visit to Gloucester, here’s a round up of all the main events of what was a joy filled journey through the many ways that our diocesan Life Together vision is being lived out over the Diocese of Gloucester. A huge thank you goes to all those who welcomed the Archbishop over the weekend and to those who supported us with prayer. We hope you find this round up inspiring.\nFriday 24 May\nFarmers’ breakfast: North Cotswolds\nArchbishop Justin started the weekend off tucking into breakfast with farmers in the North Cotswolds.\nOver bacon rolls and croissants, they talked about managing farm lands in balance with creation and the importance of talking about wellbeing and mental health.\nThe Archbishop shared how depression had had an impact on his own family. He explained that community is hugely important to allow people to talk about mental health and reach out for help.\nThe Revd Canon Craig Bishop asked him some quickfire questions and the Archbishop picked sunrise over sunset and Clarkson over Countryfile.\nWorship at St Matthew’s, Cainscross: Stroud\nNext stop was a visit to a couple of our wonderful Church of England Schools, starting with St Matthew’s Cainscross where Archbishop Justin got the chance to learn some iSingPop worship song actions.\nHeadteacher Shelly Collins said, “It has been such a privilege for us to show how the school is making links with the local community, really living out our vision of ‘with love and faith, we aspire and achieve’.\n“The Archbishop was so down to earth and clearly enjoyed taking part in the Q&A and spent time speaking to the children during the whole school picnic. This visit has given the school such a buzz, and we will remember Archbishop Justin, his openness and kindness for a very long time.”\nReflections on the Good Samaritan with children at Randwick School: Stroud\nArchbishop Justin was invited to join children as they learned about the Good Samaritan and reflect on what the story tells us about God. This term, the children have been focusing on the value of courage.\nIn the year 4’s Philosophy for Children lesson, with Ms Newbold, the children studied the story of the Good Samaritan, considering whether it was the Samaritan’s responsibility to stop and help an injured man that he came across along the road.\nAlthough they decided that there were lots of people who were in a position to help the man, the Archbishop encouraged the children to approach the story with an attitude of compassion. He suggested that you should always consider whether you yourself might be able to help and if you can’t, to think about someone who can.\nThe Shop on the Common, Amberley: Stroud\nA thriving community shop and café situated inside Holy Trinity Church at Amberley was officially opened by Archbishop Justin Welby. The shop has been running for 10 months, but this was the official opening day.\nThe Archbishop praised the work of the volunteers, saying,“Churches should not be places to be used for 2 hours a week, but for the use of the whole community.”\nWhen Amberley Village Shop Post Office closed seven years ago, the community shop and café project began. Archbishop Justin met with volunteers, learned how to serve a latte and named the balcony the John Spiers gallery, after the late vicar who died in January. His widow Doreen was able to be with the Archbishop as they took a moment to remember John’s service to the community in Amberley.\nArchbishop Justin was also reunited with Daphne, a lady who went to school with his late mother.\nRead more about the Amberley project here.\nEvening Prayer at St John Baptist, Cirencester\nThe Archbishop and the Bishops joined the service of Evening Prayer at St John Baptist in Cirencester this evening as part of our Big Mission Weekend.\nThis service takes place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and is open to everyone.\nLocal community partners, including Andrew Tubb, the Chief Executive of Cirencester Town Council, Bernie Harding who manages the Hope Project, Cirencester and Kim Whyard, Chair of Churches Together in Cirencester joined the worship.\nThe headteacher of Watermoor School, Lois Smith and the headteacher of Powells School, Helen Cooper, together with children from the schools also attended.\nThe Grace Network: Stroud\nThe first day of the Big Mission Weekend finished with around 400 supporters and staff of the Grace Network at a party at Brimscombe Mill, Stroud.\nThe Archbishop had the chance to meet staff from The Bike Drop and to sample the fantastic Long Table food. He also had a tour of the Grace Network’s new venue which is a work in progress, but the vision for the project is phenomenal. A new economy based on Christian justice and inclusion.\nBishop Rachel led a Q&A on ‘Radical hospitality’ with Archbishop Justin.\nRead more about the Grace Network here.\nSaturday 25 May\nMessy Church at St Paul and St Stephen Church: Gloucester\nMessy Church has been meeting at St Paul and St Stephen’s Church in Gloucester for more than 10 years and is a thriving part of the community’s worship.\nFamilies turned out in force for an action packed time of crafts, singing, prayer, food and friendship which they invited the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop Rachel along to as part of the Big Mission Weekend.\nThere were 7 crafts on the theme of ‘Telling the good news’ and Archbishop Justin was even able to make himself a new mitre (hat) to wear as he went around the activities.\nThe children took the chance to pray for the Archbishop as he set off on a prayer walk around Gloucester, using the worship song I am walking for the Lord.\nPrayer walk: Gloucester\nArchbishop Justin and Bishop Rachel went on a prayer walk around Gloucester, meeting PCSOs in Gloucester Park, chatting to volunteers and skaters at Gloucester Skate Project and praying over all the relationships and community work happening.\nEach year, the Skate Project volunteers try to do one thing to make the park a better place.\nThere was a stop at Wholly Gelato, a Christian family run ice cream business with a shop in the Gloucester Food Dock, where Archbishop Justin was hugely impressed with the quality of both the ice cream and the coffee, as well as the welcome.\nThe final stop was at The Clean Plate, a community café which has been set up by a group of people in recovery from addiction to create an alcohol- free space for those who want to socialise away from alcohol. The group shared stories of their history and the support of the Nelson Trust.\n“Trauma can be overwhelming, but the Nelson Trust have the heart to hold hope. People who experience trauma shroud it in shame and silence. The Nelson Trust dilutes that shame and helps to build self esteem again.”\nSmall Ships Steampunk Pirate Festival: Gloucester\nArchbishop Justin and Bishop Rachel had a ball at the Small Ships Festival. It’s the little sister of the iconic Gloucester Tall Ships Festival, where steam punk aficionados gather in bright and colourful costumes to celebrate.\nIt was a celebration of early 19th century science fiction, “pure imagination, mixing the sublime and the ridiculous”.\nBishop Rachel and Archbishop Justin got quite competitive with the biscuit dunk off during the traditional tea duelling and teapot racing and the small boat race.\nThe Steampunks of Gloucester are working with Lightspeed Photography, supporting mental health and Art Shape, supporting adults with disabilities, across all their events for the year.\nSportily community fun day: Gloucester\nBig crowds turned out with the sun for the Sportily community fun day at Innsworth Community Junior School.\n“Fluff it. Duff it. Score it. Smash it. Whatever you do, just give it a go,” is the Sportily moto and people were living that out all over the field.\nFrom axe throwing and sumo wrestling, to bouncy castles and rounders, there were loads of activities to try out. Families had to track down the volunteers wearing sparkly lanyards and speak to them about what they enjoyed in their role.\nVolunteers handed out free cakes and drinks and a big football session happened at one end of the field.\nSportily works in 14 locations across the Diocese of Gloucester, with around 1,100 people taking part in their activities each week. Research shows that sports ministry can act as a context for faith exploration, discovery and worship and this is something that is growing locally.\nChurch Housing Association visit: Gloucester\nThe Diocese of Gloucester has worked closely with the Church Housing Association in a bid to make good the recommendations in the Coming Home Report. At present the Church Housing Association is working with Bromford to buy 7 affordable 3-4 bed homes which should be ready for occupation in summer 2025.\nThe Archbishop was shown around the plots and looked at some completed homes in the same style.\nHe also met some of Bromford’s Neighbourhood coaches – Bromford employs a Neighbourhood Coach for every 175 homes who in Innsworth will work closely with Sportily workers.\nMeeting housing need for the poorest and most marginalised is integral to the mission of the church. The Church Housing Foundation is a key part of the Church of England’s response to the housing crisis.\nYou can find out more about the Church Housing Association here. You can see more about the Diocese of Gloucester’s work on providing suitable housing here.\nWorship at The Rock, Cheltenham\nA quiet and reflective evening service took us into Saturday evening with young people from The Rock and Fabric, two youth mission networks in West Cheltenham.\nFabric is a youth minister project, coordinated by Trinity Cheltenham, to plant and support youth work in churches without any provision and encourage others through worship gatherings and training.\nThe Rock works to bring God’s hope, purpose and connection to young people, especially those impacted by exclusion, disadvantage or vulnerability.\nThe prayer spaces used for worship are regular features of the local ministry to local schools and to the young people who attend The Rock.\nPartners’ dinner at St Philip and St James, Leckhampton: Cheltenham\nSunday 26 May\nWorship at Tutshill: Forest of Dean\nThe Archbishop joined the worshipping community at Tutshill for a service that included many personal stories of the transformation that faith can make in lives.\nFrom Rosalind who found comfort in her church community when she was left as a single parent to young triplets, to Guy and Karyna, a Ukrainian and a British person who met at a Ukrainian Support Hub, the community bears witness to the power of God’s love.\nThe gathered worshippers heard about the Wellbeing Project which seeks to support people’s physical, emotional, psychological, relation and spiritual needs.\nLots of people from community groups also turned out for this exciting day, from the Rainbows, St John’s Ambulance, the Police, GPs and health professionals, young people who have recently been confirmed and representatives from the Severn Area Rescue Association (SARA).\nLunch and conversation in Blakeney: Forest of Dean\nArchbishop Justin and Bishop Rachel met with the worshipping community in Blakeney and some friends to pray over the village as the church considers and listens to what God might have in store for them in the coming years.\nArchbishop Justin joined in with a listening process to try to discern their next steps, prayed a blessing over them and enjoyed fellowship and company.\n.\nCelebration Diocesan Cathedral Eucharist: Whole diocese\nThe Cathedral was full for a joyful service as we came to the end of our Diocesan Big Mission Weekend.\nThe Archbishop spoke from the heart, without notes, telling of the people and places that he had encountered over this spirit-filled Bank Holiday weekend in the Diocese of Gloucester.\nHe talked of people finding their hope and their strength in times of trouble through faith and through the love God seen through the people around them.\nYou can read his sermon here\nArchbishop of Canterbury transcript or watch the video of the service below.\nYou can find more stories and photos on our social media posts and also on the\nNews pages of the diocesan website.",

    "text": "18/04/2024 - 18:21 O Exército da Nigéria anunciou nesta quinta-feira (18) que encontrou uma das 276 estudantes sequestradas pela organização jihadista Boko Haram há dez anos na localidade de Chibok, nordeste do país. Lydia, que está grávida, foi resgatada com os três filhos perto da cidade de Ngoshe, no estado de Borno, informou o Exército. Ocorrido em 14 de abril de 2014, o sequestro gerou indignação no mundo e deu origem à campanha “Traga nossas meninas de volta”. O Exército resgatou várias delas ao longo dos anos, muitas das quais haviam sido obrigadas a se casar com seus sequestradores. Cerca de 100 jovens continuam desaparecidas. Hoje enfraquecido pela ação do Exército e por disputas internas com a facção rival Estado Islâmico da África Oriental, o Boko Haram continua realizando atentados no norte da Nigéria, principalmente em áreas remotas. A insurgência jihadista nessa região do país já deixou mais de 40 mil mortos e 2 milhões de deslocados desde 2009. Os sequestros em massa continuam sendo uma grande preocupação na Nigéria, diante da proliferação de grupos criminosos armados que atuam em estradas, residências e escolas em busca de resgates. Mais de 1.680 estudantes foram sequestrados em escolas nigerianas entre 2014 e 2022, segundo a ONG Save the Children. pma/ks/cpy/hgs/db/lb/am",
