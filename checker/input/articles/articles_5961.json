    "title": "La preocupación de la Iglesia por la crisis económica | TN",
    "text": "La Iglesia envió un mensaje para esta Navidad y mostró su preocupación por la crisis económica que atraviesa el país y que afecta a los más chicos. El titular de la Conferencia Episcopal Argentina (CEA), monseñor Oscar Ojea , a través de un video, pidió que el alimento le llegue a cada argentino. “No existe la paz sin la justicia”.\n“Dios se ha hecho ser humano y ha venido a compartir la vida con nosotros. Desde el comienzo él ha querido ser un niño como nosotros y vivir la experiencia del nacer”, comenzó el mensaje.\nLeé también: Con la autorización de la bendición a parejas gay, Francisco toma la decisión más controvertida de su papado\nAdemás, Ojea expresó: “Nuestra limitación de seres humanos es que necesitamos, para subsistir, del apoyo y del sustento de los demás, no somos autosuficientes. El niño Dios nos recuerda también a aquellos que han tenido el privilegio de ser padres para nuestros hijos, la experiencia de tener un hijo, de esa maravilla que Dios hace con el misterio de la vida, y al compartir la vida de todos los niños, el niño Jesús tiene una preocupación especial por la paz”.\nSin embargo, expresó que “no existe la paz sin la justicia”. “Y tenemos verdaderamente una preocupación seria para que el alimento pueda llegar a todos los chicos y chicas de nuestra patria”, remarcó.\n“El niño dios quiere acompañar nuestra vida. Ha nacido pobre para indicarnos también que debemos preocuparnos para que el pan llegue a todos, que no haya nadie que se quede sin ese bien primario , principalmente nuestros chicos porque sino no hay modo de construir la paz. Si no nos preocupamos por ellos nos despreocupamos del futuro y si nos despreocupamos del futuro seremos hombres y mujeres sin horizonte, hombres y mujeres cuyas vidas no valen la pena” , manifestó Ojea.\nLeé también: Por qué, como nunca antes, las religiones quedaron envueltas en la campaña electoral\nAdemás, sumó: “Nosotros en Navidad besamos los piececitos del niño, que en el fondo es besar los pies de nuestros hermanos y hermanas, él ha querido embarrarse con nosotros, caminar nuestra tierra, hacerse uno de nosotros y enseñarnos a servir. Besar los pies del niño es comprometernos con el servicio de los hermanos y hermanas ”.\n“Que el Señor nos conceda en esta Navidad, junto al niño Jesús, rescatar estas preocupaciones esenciales que nos van a llevar a vivir a fondo el misterio de la Noche Buena y de la Navidad, hacernos buenos, configurarnos con Jesús para poder servir cada día mejor a nuestros hermanos. Que Dios los bendiga”, finalizó.",

    "text": "ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – As the area’s first major snowstorm hit the area, and one young Rochester entrepreneur is happy to see the snow coming down. In 2022, when Adam Gyura was a Junior in high school, he started his own lawn care and snow removal business, with the goal of making money to use for college. “I figured I had to make money somehow, and I wanted to be my own boss,” Gyura said. His business is called 2 Seasons Lawn & Property Care and for the last few months, he’s been preparing for the first snow of the season. “I have been to Fleet Farm nearly every week, getting salt, getting gas. Just getting ready.” Now 18, Gyura’s business has taken off, with more than 50 customers. On Friday, he got a head start with snow removal. With the help of his cousin, he planned on clearing 14 houses throughout the night. But he said Saturday will be when the work really starts, when he will be clearing 34 houses. “We will be all day and night working, it will be rough, but we’re ready,” he said. He said his dad an entrepreneur, too he’s helped him a lot with getting the business started. “I don’t think it’s anything too special. I like being my own boss. Doing my own thing. Just advocating and working for myself. I just really enjoy it. Some people don’t some people do. But yeah, I just like trying to inspire my brothers.” He said if someone has been considering starting a business, it takes a lot of hard work, but it pays off in the end. “If you want to start your own business, just go and do it,” he said. “I started out going door to door knocking. It deters you a little bit, but sooner or later, you get a person, then another person and another. Next thing you know, you’re hauling around snowblowers and a truck.” Gyura said he’s completely booked for the winter but has opening for customers for spring and summer.
