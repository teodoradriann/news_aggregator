    "title": "Dil Ko Tumse Pyaar Hua Upcoming Twist: Chirag weeps for Ragini; vows to ruin Deepika",
    "text": "Dil Ko Tumse Pyaar Hua the Star Plus television show produced by SVF Entertainment has seen engaging drama with Chirag (Akkshith Sukhija) deciding to take Ragini along with him and shift to London. There was a shockwave in the house with all being emotional with the decision of Chirag. Lavanya and Omkar tried to stop Chirag, but he was adamant of not changing his plan this time. However, we saw Deepika (Aditi Tripathi) changing the story by declaring that Ragini is her daughter and that she had given birth to twin daughters. She showed Chirag all the proof for her declaration and took Ragini along with her.\nThe upcoming episode will see Chirag struggling to come to terms with Ragini being gone. He will weep, yell and make a big scene of Deepika ruining his life. He will plead before his parents to come to Deepika’s house with him and help him get his daughter back. But both Lavanya and Omkar will tell Chirag that Ragini is safe with her mother. This will irk Chirag all the more. He will vow to ruin Deepika’s life and will criticize her for snatching away all his happiness. Lavanya will be so angry at Chirag’s behaviour that she will slap him. She will ask him not to curse his own blood again.\nWill Chirag ever get to know the truth?\nDil Ko Tumse Pyaar Hua, starring Aditi Tripathi as Deepika and Akshit Sukhija as Chirag in the lead roles, is set against the vibrant backdrop of Rajasthan. The show explores the love story of Deepika and Chirag, and the societal and familial challenges they face. The plot thickens when Chirag’s family proposes marriage to Jhanvi (Deepika’s sister), but Chirag chooses Deepika instead, leading to conflict between both families. The unfolding story promises to explore whether love can triumph over societal and familial opposition.",

    "title": "Trump Reveals His Main Suspect in Cover-Up of JFK Assassination Docs",
    "text": "Commentary\nTrump Reveals His Main Suspect in Cover-Up of JFK Assassination Docs\nFormer President Donald J. Trump believes the CIA, at best, played a part in suppressing documents regarding the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. At worst, he may believe the CIA was actually involved.\nRegardless of how far his belief goes, he has publicly committed to releasing the file for the American people to read if he wins a second term in the Oval Office.\nHe shared this information Thursday on the “\nAll-In Podcast” with hosts Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks and David Friedberg, who “cover all things economic, tech, political, social & poker.”\nBut Trump wasn’t putting on any kind of poker face when broached with the question of whether he would be releasing the Kennedy file.\nNor did he flinch when posed with the question by Calacanis as to whether he agreed with independent presidential candidate\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. that the CIA killed his uncle.\nWhat Trump did was explain how he was persuaded by those in his Cabinet to hold off from releasing the secretive information a bit longer.\nIt was Palihapitiya who pushed the issue as the former president was being called away to dinner. The tech billionaire, who has thrown his weight behind Trump, didn’t want the GOP candidate to depart without explaining the apparent change of heart.\n“In the\n2016 election, you said the first thing or one of the things you wanted to do was release the JFK file,” the host said. “And then you said later, ‘I saw it and I just, I wasn’t really ready to do it.’ And then I saw a clip where you changed your mind and you said, ‘I think we’re ready to see this file.’ And I’m just curious, what’s in it? What happened?”\nCalacanis interrupted Palihapitiya’s questioning as well, saying, “Tell us right now.”\nTrump explained that he did release some of the information, but received pushback from people in his administration on going any further.\nThey must have\nsounded very convincing at the moment. It was Trump’s trust in them that caused him to refrain from releasing the complete file.\n“I was hit by some people that work for me that are great people, that you would respect. They asked me not to do it, and I’m saying, ‘Why? Tell me why?’ And they said, ‘Sir, I think it needs a little more time,'” he said. “And I released a lot, but I said, ‘If they feel so strongly, I respect the people.'”\n“But this time, I’m just gonna do it,” Trump said.\nCalacanis then said, “RFK says the CIA killed his uncle. Do you believe that?”\n“Well this wasn’t CIA that asked me, but I think CIA was probably behind it,” the former president said. That last clause is where it gets murky. It’s not clear whether Trump was saying he thinks the CIA was behind the document suppression or whether he thinks the CIA was behind the actual assassination. Viewers were split on which position Trump was taking.\nNot only is the JFK file relevant history, but it is the people’s document, not the government’s. It should be placed in the hands of the people.\nThe reason the CIA — or whatever other organization or individual — would want the information suppressed can’t be good. It reeks of something being hidden.\nTrump now seems to be willing to let the people decide for themselves. It’s exactly what he should do.\nWhat exactly is the government intent on hiding?\nIf a part of the U.S. government was involved in the assassination of Kennedy over Vietnam or for some other reason, this is information that will help to design adequate steps going forward.\nIt will also speak volumes as to how far back our government went rogue.\nThis is just another reason to vote for\nTrump in November. You know President Joe Biden won’t release the file.\nTruth and Accuracy\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.\n Read our editorial standards.",

    "text": "三陰性乳癌「復發率高三倍」 國衛院、清大開發新藥破解抗藥性\nCNEWS匯流新聞網記者陳鈞凱／台北報導\n三陰性乳癌約占所有乳癌的10至15%，因缺乏荷爾蒙受體與HER2蛋白表現，無法接受現有標靶治療，只能依賴傳統化療藥物，但超過4成以上會復發，進而對多種化療藥物產生多重抗藥性，導致患者陷入無藥可醫的困境，國衛院今（3）日發表與清華大學聯手開發，找到驅動蛋白KIF2C標靶新藥，與化療併用可有效抑制具抗藥性的腫瘤生長，未來有望成為治療新曙光。\n國衛院生技與藥物研究所所長謝興邦是帶領研究員郭靜娟與助研究員林書玉助，與清華大學生醫學院教授王慧菁、講座教授孫玉珠團隊共同合作，成功開發出全球第一個具細胞穿透性的KIF2C小分子抑制劑。研究成果將於2025年8月發表於頂尖期刊《Developmental Cell》。\n謝興邦說，癌症化療抗藥性是臨床治療面臨的一大挑戰，尤其對三陰性乳癌患者而言，更是關乎生死的關鍵問題。三陰性乳癌目前只能依賴傳統化療藥物，如紫杉醇，雖然初期可有效縮小腫瘤，但40%以上會復發，且三陰性乳癌復發率為一般乳癌三倍，多集中於診斷後三年內，一旦復發，腫瘤常產生多重抗藥性，導致患者無藥可醫。\n研究團隊是自2017年起，透過臨床大數據結合分子技術，成功篩選出對抗三陰性乳癌化療抗藥性的全新治療標靶驅動蛋白KIF2C。\n王慧菁指出，KIF2C是一種微管解聚蛋白，負責修正染色體連接錯誤的微管，確保染色體正確分離，維持細胞基因體穩定，她形容，KIF2C如同細胞分裂的「糾察隊長」，糾正錯誤微管連結。然而，當KIF2C在癌細胞中過度表現，會幫助腫瘤細胞抵抗紫杉醇的干擾，導致抗藥性。\n王慧菁說，KIF2C於癌細胞中異常過度表現，可幫助癌細胞在化療壓力下依然完成細胞分裂，是造成紫杉醇抗藥性的關鍵因子，團隊進一步研究發現，抗藥性腫瘤會改變微管蛋白後轉譯修飾，增強KIF2C活性，因此抑制KIF2C將是突破抗藥性的一條新路。\n研究團隊隨後在謝興邦指導學生合成超過60種不同KIF2C小分子抑制劑之下，跨機構協作成功開發出全球第一個具細胞穿透性的KIF2C小分子抑制劑。謝興邦說，此藥物不僅展現強效的毒殺活性，與紫杉醇併用時更產生明顯協同效果，可有效抑制具抗藥性的腫瘤生長；研究團隊目前更著手開發KIF2C降解劑作為新一代藥物。\n國衛院強調，研究團隊已將KIF2C抑制劑應用從三陰性乳癌拓展至女性三大婦科癌症，即卵巢癌、子宮內膜癌與子宮頸癌，並與清華大學及林口長庚醫院婦癌科合作，期望提升婦癌病患的治療成效與存活率。\n照片來源：國衛院提供\n《更多CNEWS匯流新聞網報導》\n婦科名醫性侵潛逃被通緝 台大院長開罵：醫界之恥！有膽做沒膽面對\n台北人十大死因出爐！COVID-19死亡大降7成 癌症連52年居冠\n【文章轉載請註明出處】",

    "text": "Medigene AG announced that the Company has been issued a patent by the European Patent Office protecting its inducible Medigene T cell receptor (iM-TCR) technology, which contains a control mechanism to regulate efficacy and improve safety of its T cell receptor engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapies. TCR-T therapies have demonstrated that they can effectively kill tumor cells. However, excessive activation of T cells may lead to premature exhaustion or cell death, as well as unwanted overactivity and the potential development of inflammatory responses in the body.\nThe iM-TCR technology modifies the TCR to achieve control of TCR surface expression, allowing for fine-tuning of activity against tumor cells and thereby reducing potential inflammatory responses in the body. This property is of potential benefit not only to current autologous TCR-T therapy assets, but potentially also applicable to other TCR-T based modalities. Additionally, the iM-TCR technology can potentially expand the range of targets and indications of vital or more sensitive tissue origin and provide additional safety when expanding to other disease areas beyond oncology.\nThe T cell receptor (TCR) assembly is a complex process. In humans, TCRs consist of an alpha (a) chain and a beta (ß) chain and each chain possesses a constant and a variable part. Medigene´s proprietary iM-TCR technology prevents the normal pairing of the a and the ß chains by introduction of specific engineered sequences into the constant part of each TCR chain.\nEach engineered chain is linked to an estrogen receptor sequence, which only allows the two iM-TCR chains to pair (dimerize) in the presence of Tamoxifen, and be expressed and function at the surface of TCR-T cells in a normal manner. Consequentially, to enable the iM-TCR-T cells to function in tumor cell recognition and killing, Tamoxifen administration is required but the levels required for dimerization and TCR-T function are orders of magnitude lower than the commonly used therapeutic doses. Any TCR from Medigene?s broad library of 3S TCRs can be equipped with the proprietary iM-TCR technology, which enables the function of tumor-specific TCR-T cell therapies to be finely tuned for safety and efficacy according to clinical needs.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",

    "text": "Khawaja planned to display image of dove holding olive brancy Attempt to do so was rejected by the International Cricket Council Batter has pointed out the hypocritical nature of the ban\nUsman Khawaja has accused the International Cricket Council of adopting double standards in a fiery social media post after being banned from sending a message about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza at the Boxing Day Test.\nThe star batter had hoped to use images of a dove holding an olive branch, as well as a reference to article one of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on one of his boots and bat in the clash with Pakistan at the MCG.\nThe plan was part of Khawaja’s renewed push to raise awareness for what he sees as a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nThe left-handed run machine had support from Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association, but his application was denied by the ICC on Sunday.\nKhawaja has won the support of his skipper Pat Cummins (pictured together on Christmas Day) for his plan to display a dove holding an olive branch on his equipment in the Boxing Day Test\nThe Aussie star took to Instagram to post images of other cricketers who’ve been allowed to display messages on their bats, like South African star Keshav Maharaj, who had the Hindu ‘Om’ symbol on his equipment at the World Cup (pictured)\nWest Indian player Nicholas Pooran had a crucifix on his bat along with the word ‘Believe’\nOn Christmas Day Khawaja took to Instagram to hit back at what he sees as hypocritical treatment from cricket’s peak governing body.\nHe uploaded a reel accompanied by Kanye West’s song ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing’ and the caption, ‘Merry Christmas everybody. Sometimes you just gotta laugh. Cya at Boxing Day! #inconsistent #double standards’.\nThe reel featured an image of a black dove holding an olive branch above the words: ‘Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Free and equal. All human beings are born free and equal and should be treated the same way.’\nHis reel then switches to a series of images of cricketers who have displayed messages on their equipment during matches without being sanctioned.\nTrinidadian cricketer Nicholas Pooran is shown with a crucifix on his bat along with the word ‘Believe’.\nSouth African star Keshav Maharaj is seen with the Hindu ‘Om’ symbol on his bat at the recent Cricket World Cup.\nKhawaja ran the hashtags ‘#inconsistent #double standards’ on his defiant social media post\nKhawaja also pointed out that his teammate Marnus Labuschagne has been allowed to display an eagle on his bat in a reference to a Bible verse (pictured)\nCummins said Khawaja’s planned dove symbol is ‘not really’ any different to the image Labuschagne has previously used\nMarnus Labuschagne is shown with an eagle on his bat, which represents a Bible verse – and prompted skipper Pat Cummins to say Khawaja’s rejected dove symbol is ‘not really’ any different from the bird his teammate was allowed to display.\n‘We really support Uzzy. He’s standing up for what he believes and I think he’s done it really respectfully,’ Cummins said.\n‘[His initial message was] “all lives are equal” and I don’t think that’s very offensive, and I’d say the same about the dove.\n‘That’s Uzzy. I think he can really hold his head high with the way he’s gone about it.\n‘But obviously there’s rules in place and I believe the ICC have said they’re not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you’ve got to accept it.’\nKhawaja was previously charged by the ICC for breaching its clothing and equipment regulations after he wore a black armband without permission during the first Test in Perth.\nHe wore the armband – which he has since stated was to mark a ‘personal bereavement’ – after he was told wearing shoes with the words ‘all lives are equal’ and ‘freedom is a human right’ would breach ICC rules.\nKhawaja was wearing plain black shoes and was greeted warmly by members of the Pakistan team as players from both sides went through light training sessions indoors at the MCG on Monday.\nCummins’ support for Khawaja comes as Australia prepare to roll out an unchanged line-up for the Boxing Day clash, eyeing an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.\nVictorian hero Scott Boland has shone at the MCG in each of the past two summers, but has been unable to force his way back into the team for his home Test this time around.\nThe 37-year-old was charged by the ICC after wearing a black armband in the first Test against Pakistan – but said he did so to mark a personal bereavement, not make a political statement\nThe Australians are hot favourites after a dominant 360-run victory in Perth, and wet weather may yet prove the biggest obstacle to continuing their winning ways in Melbourne.\n‘It looks like there might be a little bit of rain about for the first day or so, but Test matches here seem to have moved a little bit quicker than at other places in the last few years,’ Cummins said.\n‘So I think there will be plenty of time to finish the game. I don’t think it (the weather) will change anything.\n‘[The wicket] looks pretty good. Fair bit of grass, probably a little bit harder and not as green as last year, knowing that it’s potentially going to be under covers today and a little bit tomorrow.\nPakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema (second from left) presented Cummins with gifts for the Aussie players and their families on Christmas Day\n‘We’ll see how it plays, but it looks like a really good wicket.’\nPakistan are set to make at least two changes, with pace bowler Khurram Shahzad (ribs) out injured and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed axed after the tourists’ demolition in Perth.\nThe gloveman has been replaced by Mohammad Rizwan, who made a half-century in the drawn tour match against a Victorian XI last week.\nPakistan will confirm the final make-up of their team at the coin toss and haven’t given up hope of challenging their world-champion hosts.\n‘This is a huge opportunity for all of us,’ Pakistan captain Shan Masood said.\n‘Any kind of setback provides you with the biggest opportunity to do well and get things right.\n‘It’s a testament to this squad that they’re looking to find ways to do well, to bounce back and put in a good performance. That’s all we care about.’",

    "text": "La higiene se asocia a la mayor parte de las irregularidades detectadas en unos 4.800 establecimientos En 160 casos se procedió a la retirada del producto del mercado\nSede Conselleria Sanidade. / Faro\nCarmen Villar\nSantiago 03 JUL 2025 6:10 Fabricantes, envasadores, almacenistas, comerciantes al por menor, restaurantes o heladerías tienen en común la delicada materia prima con la que trabajan, los alimentos, y están sometidos en Galicia a un servicio de control y supervisión del que se encarga la Consellería de Sanidade. La intensificación de la actividad fiscalizadora de su personal se tradujo en un 9,4 por ciento más de inspecciones realizadas en un año , hasta las cuarenta de media cada día y,en la misma medida, de negocios examinados, más de 200 de media por semana. Toda esa labor se saldó con detecciones de incumplimientos en casi la mitad de los establecimientos.\nDatos oficiales de la Xunta Según datos facilitados por la Consellería de Sanidade a este diario, la Xunta realizó a lo largo del año 2023 —el último del que ofrece datos— un total de 15.059 inspecciones de establecimientos alimentarios en las que su personal pasó revista a hasta 10.762 negocios diferentes . De ellos, en casi un 45 por ciento —4.813 en concreto, un 7% más— «se detectaron incumplimientos» .\n¿Qué fallos se encontraron? Las inobservancias que analizan los inspectores pueden abarcar distintos aspectos: de tipo operacional (cómo funciona en su día a día el local), estructural, de producto o de información al consumidor. Desde el departamento sanitario autonómico indican que durante 2023 «la mayor parte» de los incumplimientos detectados por el personal de Inspección Veterinaria de Saúde Pública tienen que ver con «medidas de higiene» . De hecho, en el listado de comprobaciones que manejan los inspectores, se enfatizan especialmente estos requisitos.\nAdvertencias antes de sancionar Las irregularidades halladas pueden acabar en sanción, pero antes Sanidade advierte de las deficiencias e insta a su corrección. Así, en 2023, detallan desde la Consellería, se realizaron 861 requirimientos de corrección del incumplimiento . Si bien la Xunta elevó la presión de sus inspecciones y puso más negocios bajo la lupa, las propuestas de apertura de expediente por infracciones se rebajaron en una cuarta parte con respecto a las contabilizadas un año antes: fueron 359 frente a las 489 de 2022 , cuando ya se había notado un descenso en relación las 531 de 2021.\nDos de cada tres empresas de la hostelería investigadas por Trabajo no pasan una inspección\nSanciones y casos destacados No es inusual que la Xunta decrete la suspensión de actividad del negocio analizado, una decisión que tomó en 106 casos en 2023 y además en 160 ocasiones apunta que se realizaron retiradas de productos del mercado.\nPanadero artesano gallega en plena elaboración. / Faro\nInfracciones leves en 2024 Aunque los datos de inspecciones de 2024 están siendo todavía recopilados, la Consellería de Sanidade dispone ya de ejemplos de infracciones leves detectados durante el año pasado y cita incumplimientos «por condiciones higiénico-sanitarias» —con sanciones de hasta 1.200 euros — o defiencias administrativas relacionadas con la inscripción en los registros sanitarios —penalizados con sanciones de hasta 600 euros , salvo que requieran autorización administrativa—.\nSanidade detecta irregularidades en el 45% de negocios alimentarios que inspecciona\nPrimera sanción grave en 2024 A diferencia de 2023, en el que no se registró en Galicia ninguna sanción grave —que puede suponer entre 20.001 y 600.000 euros de penalización—, en 2024 se sancionó a un establecimiento por «comercialización de alimentos sin identificación y utilizando una marca sanitaria falsa» . Ese expediente, añade Sanidade, finalizó con una sanción de 20.001 euros , con deducción del 20% por reconocimiento de responsabilidad y pronto pago.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo",
