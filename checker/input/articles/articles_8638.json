Hier, le député LFI-NFP du Vaucluse Raphaël Arnault s'est exprimé sur BFMTV depuis une manifestation anti-émeutes d'extrême droite à Londres. « C’était une évidence pour moi de me rendre ici, en tant qu'antifasciste\", a lancé Raphaël Arnault, co-fondateurs de la Jeune Garde Antifasciste. Le député de 29 ans, dont la candidature avait suscité la polémique pendant les législatives, a déclaré être venu \"manifester contre le fait qu'il y ait des milices d'extrême droite, suprémacistes blanches, quelquefois néo-nazies, qui se mobilisent et qui mènent des attaques racistes les plus ignobles\". \"C'est le champion olympique des manifestations pro-palestiniennes moitié Hamas moitié Daesh, du silence, du déni et de la complaisance\" estime Zohra Bitan. \"C'est le champion olympique des manifestations pro-palestiniennes moitié Hamas moitié Daesh, du silence, du déni et de la complaisance\" estime Zohra Bitan.

    "text": "By Rehan Khan\nISLAMABAD, June 01 (APP): Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) Chairman Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi on Saturday expressed his satisfaction with the ongoing Hajj operations and called upon government and private Hajj organizers to ensure the comfort and ease of pilgrims.\nTalking to media, he emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of service, particularly in ensuring the well-being of the intending pilgrims.\nAshrafi lauded the current Hajj operations, noting significant improvements in logistical arrangements, transportation, and accommodation for the pilgrims. He highlighted that the collaborative efforts between the Saudi and Pakistani authorities had resulted in a more organized and efficient Hajj experience this year.\n“I am pleased with the way the Hajj operations have been conducted so far. The cooperation between the Pak-Saudi authorities has been exemplary, ensuring that our pilgrims can perform their religious duties with dignity and peace of mind,” Ashrafi stated.\nThe PUC chairman also issued an advisory for pilgrims urging to book their Hajj packages through authorized organizers to avoid falling victim to fraudulent activities. He said the Saudi and Pakistani authorities, alongside the Hajj Organizers Association Pakistan (HAOP), had emphasized the necessity of legitimate booking to ensure a safe and genuine pilgrimage experience.\nAshrafi said to assist pilgrims in making legitimate arrangements, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, and HOAP had disseminated comprehensive guidelines from time to time. He said these guidelines, frequently shared through a section of media, were designed to protect innocent pilgrims from the clutches of fraudsters.\nAshrafi advised the prospective pilgrims to verify the credentials of Hajj organizers, ensure that the organizers were officially recognized by the relevant Saudi and Pakistani authorities and follow the booking procedures as outlined in the official guidelines. By adhering to these recommendations, he said pilgrims could secure their journey and avoid any potential scams that could jeopardize their pilgrimage.\nAshrafi said the Dar-ul-Ifta of Saudi Arabia had issued a significant religious decree stating that performing Hajj without official permission was forbidden. “This Fatwa aims to uphold the sanctity and order of the pilgrimage by ensuring that all pilgrims follow the proper channels and guidelines established by the Saudi authorities,” he added.\nAshrafi said pilgrims traveling from Islamabad and Karachi had expressed immense satisfaction with the “Road to Makkah” project. He said this initiative had significantly streamlined the travel process, making the spiritual journey to the holy land more efficient and comfortable.\nConcluding his remarks, Ashrafi expressed deep appreciation for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammad bin Salman for their unwavering commitment to providing comprehensive facilities and support to the ‘Guests of Allah Almighty’ through every possible means.",

    "text": "South Bend vigil group prays for less gun violence in 2024 SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- There are promising signs in South Bend’s fight against gun violence, but still plenty of work to be done. Through November, South Bend police recorded 18 fatal shootings this year, according to the department’s crime dashboard, though that number will go up once December numbers are included. It’s slightly lower than the city’s average of 22 fatal shootings over the last three years. However, the significant change is total victims, including non-fatal shootings. There were 73 this year through November, compared to 117 over the same period last year according to the crime dashboard, a 60% drop. But that’s still preliminary and doesn’t include December when police have responded to six additional shootings. For every deadly shooting that happens in South Bend, you can expect a small group of community members to be there on-site days or weeks after, with uplifting prayers for the victim and their family. During the last vigil of the year, they also prayed for the gun violence to end going into the new year. “It helps heal,” says Michael Elliott, with the On-Site Prayer Ministry. Elliott has led on-site prayer vigils for 18 years, remembering victims killed, typically victims of gun violence. Thursday was the 25th vigil Elliott has led this year. “And we’re going to start 2024 off with two more,” Elliott says. Elliott and the group prayed in remembrance of thirty-four-year-old Isiah Siggers, who was shot and killed on O'Brien Street earlier this month. His death, happening just 20 minutes after another shooting that killed a 52-year-old woman on Ardmore Trail. The two tragedies add to the 18 fatal shootings the South Bend Police Department recorded through November. Four of them were children. “The ones with the children, those are the hardest,” admits Elliott. It’s hard to bear, but Elliot says he knows these vigils help victims’ families move forward. For both vigils held for 11-year-old T’yon Horston and one-year-old Kylin Brooks, Elliott remembers it’s something both families were thankful for. “I think it shows the family that there are people who care, even if we don’t know each other,” says Elliott. He doesn't know if the vigils can help stop gun violence, but he does know it can help heal. “I don’t have any more of an answer than the police chief does, or the mayor,” Elliott says. “Everybody’s working in their own way to try to reduce the violence.” Siggers’ shooting is one of the few that remain unsolved. If you have any information, you're urged to call Michiana Crime Stoppers at 574-288-STOP. All callers can remain anonymous.",

Carlo Ancelotti l'apprécie beaucoup et a insisté ces dernières semaines pour que le défenseur français signe un nouveau contrat - son contrat actuel se termine l'été prochain, en même temps que celui de Davies.\nL'article continue ci-dessous Les souhaits d'Ancelotti ont été exaucés, puisque Marca a rapporté que le Real Madrid s'était mis d'accord avec Mendy sur un nouveau contrat. Il s'agirait d'une prolongation de deux ans, qui le maintiendrait dans la capitale espagnole jusqu'en 2027. Il ne manque plus que la signature de Mendy lui-même pour que l'accord devienne officiel.\nProchain match: Jeux d'amitié des clubs MIL RMA Présentation du match Mendy a prouvé sa valeur au Real Madrid la saison dernière, et il devrait rester une figure importante pour au moins 12 mois supplémentaires.\nPublicité",
