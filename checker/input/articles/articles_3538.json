    "text": "Those who died in the Stardust fire tragedy have been written into the history books, the Irish premier said, as a State ceremony honoured the victims and survivors.\nHundreds of people attended the ceremony of commemoration, which was led by Irish president Michael D Higgins, at the Garden of Remembrance in north Dublin.\nThe hour-long ceremony remembered and honoured the 48 young people who died in the 1981 disaster.\nCo-designed with the families of the victims, the ceremony also remembered all those who helped victims and their families on the night and over the years since.\nPresident of Ireland Michael D Higgins with Stardust survivor and campaigner Antoinette Keegan (Damien Storan/PA)\nMr Higgins laid a wreath on behalf of the people of Ireland.\nIn a statement, he said: “I was pleased to have the honour of laying a wreath on behalf of the people of Ireland at today’s ceremony of commemoration in the Garden of Remembrance on what was a very important day for the relatives of the victims, for the survivors and for all those affected by the Stardust fire.\n“I look forward to welcoming the families who lost loved ones and those who were injured in the fire to Aras an Uachtarain in the autumn.”\nFamily members also laid a wreath for each of the 48 victims on the water in the cruciform pool while the names of victims and extracts from their pen portraits were read out.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Irish premier Simon Harris said: “It is fitting that in this special place in our capital city, a place for reflection and recollection, that we gathered to commemorate those 48 young people who went out to enjoy themselves on Valentine’s eve in 1981 and never came home.\nChristy Moore singing during a Stardust ceremony of commemoration at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin (Damien Storan/PA)\n“I know that’s what those 48 young people were to their families and to their communities.\n“You, the families of those who died, those who survived, those who were injured and those who fought to save lives on that night and afterwards, became their heroes.\n“So many people here today, and many who sadly did not live to see today, never gave up fighting for the memory of their loved ones.\n“Today, finally, at last your fight sees them properly commemorated by the State, in recognition of their terrible loss in a national tragedy.\n“You have ensured that your loved ones and the Stardust tragedy will be remembered by the generations to come.\n“You have ensured their names are written in the history books, just as their 48 young faces are etched on our national collective memory.”\nFamily members lay wreaths during a Stardust ceremony of commemoration at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin (Damien Storan/PA)\nThe majority of those attending were the families of those who died, survivors and first responders who worked on the night of the fire.\nUillean piper Kevin Rowsome performed The Parting Glass, which was followed by writer Doyle reading out Names.\nMary Byrne performed This Is The Moment while the Dublin Fire Brigade, which was central to rescuing people from the fire, performed Amazing Grace.\nChristy Moore sang They Never Came Home, which was followed by Eddie Sherlock performing You Will Never Walk Alone.\nFr Joe Jones said: “We are here today struggling for words to express our feelings, and lost for words.\n“We remember those whose lives were cut short, the 48 young people who never came home.\n“Their names are written forever in our hearts, never to be forgotten.\n“Bless those who mourn the lives of these young people, give them healing and the comfort of your love, that they may face each day with hope and certain that nothing can take from the richness of the gift of each life remembered today.\n“We remember also those who have died and whose lives were imprinted with grief and pain, as they fought hard for justice over the years.\n“Their efforts were not in vain.”\nOfficers outside the venue in the hours after the incident (Tony Harris/PA)\nDays later, Mr Harris made a State apology in the Irish parliament.\nAntoinette Keegan, whose sisters Mary and Martina died in the fire, described it as a “very momentous day”.\n“It was really special. Forty-three years later and every effort went into and all the people that participated, absolutely fantastic,” the campaigner said.\n“It was emotional but at the same time it was like a joyful day. And for the 48 victims being remembered, never been forgotten.\n“I also remember my two parents who were major campaigners in this, John and Christine Keegan, they weren’t forgotten about either because they were brought in to today, and (long-term campaigner) Eugene Kelly and (journalist) Charlie Bird.\n“It has been a big day and the 48 victims should always be remembered and never forgotten.”\nThe ceremony was brought to an end by the Artane Band playing the national anthem.",

    "title": "What Does Religious Freedom Mean in Ken Paxton’s Texas?",
    "text": "The borders of Ken Paxton’s vision of religious freedom became a little clearer this week when the attorney general sued Annunciation House, an independent Catholic immigrant ministry in El Paso. Claiming suspicions of “alien harboring, human smuggling, and operating a stash house,” on February 7 Paxton demanded the respite center’s documents regarding the identities and services rendered to the immigrants. Annunciation House asked for more time to seek counsel on whether any of the documents could legally be withheld. Paxton refused, so the migrant-aid group sued Paxton; now Paxton is suing Annunciation House to revoke its state license.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn describing Annunciation House, Paxton’s press releases use the term “nongovernmental organization” (NGO), the term used most commonly to describe international relief agencies such as those that partner with federal governments and the United Nations. This is a specific word choice. There’s no technical difference between an NGO and a nonprofit organization in the United States, but on the far right, where Paxton generates votes and campaign funds, there’s a big difference in connotation. NGOs are big, liberal, global actors. Nonprofits are the do-gooders next door, and they are often religious. The irony, of course, is that it doesn’t get much more next-door or religious than Annunciation House. Its website reads like a testimony at a Wednesday night prayer service: “the Gospel calls us all to the poor and . . . the life and presence of Jesus in the Gospels is so completely in relation to the poor.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"From my perspective, it’s incredibly frustrating to see politicians who regularly justify their actions based on their faith to then persecute those who use the same rationale to do things they don’t like,” said Stephen Reeves, executive director of Fellowship Southwest, a missions and advocacy group affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.\\n\\n\\n\\nReeves spent years as a lawyer with the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, working to preserve the special place of religion in the United States. Paxton’s intentions are explicit, Reeves said, and instructive as to the kind of hostility religious organizations in Texas can expect if their expressions of religion aren’t in favor with the attorney general’s office. ​​“It’s really trying to scare religious nonprofits into not following the dictates of their faith.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if Paxton will go after a Catholic organization, there’s no reason to think he won’t also target one of the many Protestant border missions, many of which Fellowship Southwest supports, that have responded to a need in a way that they felt their faith demanded. “They feel very called by their faith—by what they understand Jesus telling them to do in the world—which is to serve migrants,” Reeves said. (Paxton’s office did not respond to an interview request by the time of publication.)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnunciation House director Ruben Garcia speaks with migrant families in El Paso in 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnunciation House, which operates five facilities in El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, is not an official ministry of the Catholic Church, but Sister Marie Lucey, a nun with the Order of Saint Francis and associate director of the Franciscan Action Network, affirmed that the work is recognized and sanctioned by the church. A number of sisters in her order have volunteered there. “The work of charity and justice is very much in accord with Catholic social teaching and the gospel of Jesus we proclaim,” Lucey said.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiocese of El Paso bishop Mark Seitz released a statement in support of Annunciation House, making it clear how the institutional church views the stakes of the conflict with Paxton. “We will vigorously defend the freedom of people of faith and goodwill to put deeply held religious convictions into practice. We will not be intimidated in our work to serve Jesus Christ in our sisters and brothers fleeing danger and seeking to keep their families together,” Seitz wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose religious convictions also lead Catholic laypeople to act. Donna Mehle moved to Corpus Christi in 2018, as migrant families were being separated under the Trump administration, and felt compelled to make immigration the primary area in which she would express her commitment to not only the gospel, but also the Catholic Church’s social teachings.\\n\\n\\n\\nCatholic social teachings, which guide followers’ lives and work in society, are found in various church documents, but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has distilled them into seven key themes. Four of the seven apply specifically to the people crossing the Texas-Mexico border, Mehle says: the life and dignity of the human person; the call to family, community, and participation; the option for the poor and vulnerable; and solidarity. The bishops, in their summary, describe solidarity in a deliberately global sense. “We are one human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological differences. We are our brothers and sisters keepers, wherever they may be. Loving our neighbor has global dimensions in a shrinking world.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a lay associate of the Sisters of Saint Joseph, Mehle said, she also partakes of the charism—the unique spiritual gift—of the sisterhood, which is “to be one with God, among ourselves, and all others.” Living so close to the border, she didn’t see how she could be one with her neighbor if she was not actively giving those in need the kind of assistance and advocacy she herself would want in their situation. Mehle started a border ministry at her Corpus Christi church that sends volunteers to respite centers, raises money and supplies for them, and hosts educational forums for the community to increase awareness about the complexities of the immigration system. “We have a duty as Catholics to participate in society and to seek the common good of everyone, especially the poor and the vulnerable,” Mehle said. For the state to close migrant respite centers “would be stripping me of that expression of my faith.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not that Catholics don’t value national security or the right of the United States to control its borders, Lucey said. “But it must do so in a way that is humane and orderly and compassionate.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRespite centers such as Annunciation House are a vital part of both the humaneness and the orderliness of the border, and they exist in every major city along the Rio Grande. It is true that respite centers will serve people who cannot show legal documentation. But many, if not most, of the migrants served there are dropped off by federal agents—either Customs and Border Protection or Immigration and Customs Enforcement—meaning they’ve been vetted and processed and are now moving on to another destination. They either have a credible claim of asylum or cannot be deported because they are coming from a country with which the United States does not have a diplomatic relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Many of the agencies in charge of public safety have leaned on Annunciation House,” said Sami DiPasquale, executive director of Abara, a migrant aid and border education nonprofit in El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. But he also sees cooperation with federal agencies as catnip for Paxton while Governor Greg Abbott quarrels with the Biden administration over Texas's immigration deterrence program, Operation Lone Star. Courts have sided with the federal government over requests to cut razor wire at the border and remove Abbott’s floating border barrier. Abbott has pushed back, saying that the Biden administration is running an “open border.” \\\"It’s all linked to SB 4 [a Texas law criminalizing border crossings between ports of entry] and efforts to push a state and federal showdown,” DiPasquale said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe wasn’t making a leap. Paxton said as much in his press release upon filing suit.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The chaos at the southern border has created an environment where NGOs, funded with taxpayer money from the Biden Administration, facilitate astonishing horrors including human smuggling,” said Paxton in the release. “While the federal government perpetuates the lawlessness destroying this country, my office works day in and day out to hold these organizations responsible for worsening illegal immigration.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut standing outside his office and looking directly at border walls, enforcement personnel, and razor wire, DiPasquale doesn’t see anything close to chaos, lawlessness, or an open border. The only people broadcasting to the world that the United States is letting anyone and everyone come in, he said, are Republicans. Paxton’s request for documents alluded to a more administrative chaos, one created by organizations that don’t require legal documents to render services. By offering shelter to migrants in the country illegally, Annunciation House is contributing to lawlessness, Paxton claims. But, DiPasquale said, plenty of community services don’t require a person to prove their immigration status before they are served. “I don’t think you could be levying accusations against Annunciation House without levying them against hospitals and other institutions that don’t require documentation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEven police departments in Texas have resisted efforts by the state government to enlist them in immigration enforcement. When Texas passed the \\\"show me your papers\\\" law in 2017, allowing police to ask about an individual’s immigration status during routine stops, police departments around the state expressed concern about the safety of their officers and their ability to keep communities safe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe idea that the respite centers, with their clean water and cots, provide an enticement for immigrants—one of the arguments border ministries have been hearing for years—is absurd, said nearly everyone interviewed for this article. “Serving desperate folks in their time of need somehow entices them? I would say ‘no way,’ ” Reeves said. Talking about respite centers as some sort of “pull factor” reveals the fact that, globally, the “push factors”—the conditions migrants are fleeing—are beyond what many, probably most, Americans can imagine. Asylum seekers often arrive at the border ill, abused, and with little more than a backpack of possessions—all evidence of how desperate they are to be here. According to Reeves, “How people of faith respond is not going to change that equation.”",

    "text": "La semaine derniÃ¨re, Electronic Arts teasait son prochain BattlefieldÂ 6 avec une premiÃ¨re annonce et un trailer mettant en avant la campagne solo du titre. Lâ€™Ã©diteur amÃ©ricain nous donnait rendez-vous cette semaine et plus prÃ©cisÃ©ment demain, le 31Â juillet, pour la prÃ©sentation officielle et dÃ©taillÃ©e de ce nouveau titre majeur de la saga emblÃ©matique. Mais, visiblement, pas besoin de cette prÃ©sentation dÃ©taillÃ©e pour satisfaire et convaincre les joueurs. BattlefieldÂ 6 est un immense succÃ¨s avec plus dâ€™un demi-million de wishlist.\n500000 wishlist pour Battlefield 6\nDemain, Electronic Arts dÃ©voilera toutes les informations sur Battlefield 6 et nous prÃ©sentera le fameux mode multijoueur. Clairement, la partie la plus attendue du titre ! Mais, mÃªme avant Ã§a, les joueurs semblent dÃ©jÃ convaincus. En quelques jours, ce sont plus de 500â€‰000 joueurs qui ont ajoutÃ© le titre Ã leur wishlist uniquement sur PC et sur la plateforme Steam de Valve.\nSelon Alinea Analytics, 60% des joueurs ayant ajoutÃ© Battlefield 6 Ã leur wishlist auraient Ã©galement dÃ©jÃ jouÃ© Ã Battlefield 2042. Preuve que la communautÃ© nâ€™est pas rancuniÃ¨re et quâ€™elle semble y croire. Il est certain quâ€™avec la prÃ©sentation de demain, les chiffres risquent de monter encore dâ€™un niveau.\nDans la foulÃ©e, Electronic Arts devrait Ã©galement lancer les prÃ©commandes. De nombreuses rumeurs Ã©voquent le lancement dâ€™une bÃ©ta privÃ©e pour le mois dâ€™aoÃ»t et une sortie du jeu aux alentours du 10 octobre. Pour le moment, rien nâ€™a Ã©tÃ© confirmÃ©.\nLa wishlist est une nouvelle faÃ§on de mesurer lâ€™attente des joueurs. Avant le lancement des prÃ©commandes, les Ã©diteurs peuvent proposer leur jeu sur une Â« liste de souhait Â» sur PC, PS5 et Xbox Series X/S. Cela permet de savoir si un titre fait sensation ou non. Le mois dernier, peu de temps aprÃ¨s son annonce au Summer Game Fest, Capcom avait confirmÃ© que Resident Evil Requiem avait Ã©tÃ© wishlistÃ© plus dâ€™un million de fois.\nCertains Ã©diteurs, de leur cÃ´tÃ©, ne donnent aucune information. Câ€™est le cas de Rockstar Games et son fameux GTAÂ 6, disponible en wishlist depuis dÃ©but mai, mais aucune information ne fut partagÃ©e Ã ce jour.\nğŸŸ£ Pour ne manquer aucune news sur le Journal du Geek, abonnez-vous sur\n[Google ActualitÃ©s]et sur[notre WhatsApp].
