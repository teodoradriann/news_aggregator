    "text": "Above: the KW office collection for Texas flood victims\nReal estate professionals across Texas and the nation are launching donation drives and volunteer efforts as search teams continue looking for survivors of the devastating flooding that has killed at least 120 people and left 173 missing in Central Texas over the July Fourth holiday.\nThe flooding began July 4 when torrential rain fell in a short amount of time across the Texas Hill Country, swelling the Guadalupe River up to 26 feet in 45 minutes, devastating communities along its banks.\nThe death toll reached 120 people as of late Wednesday, with at least 173 still missing, according to news reports. Among the dead and missing are children and counselors from Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp.\nThe National Association of Realtors® and the Realtors® Relief Foundation (RRF) activated their disaster efforts in response to the tragedy. Nick Falco, executive director of RRF, said in a statement that the organization is “working closely with Texas Realtors® and local Realtor® associations to make sure that we are supporting communities in areas affected by the flooding.”\nThe foundation uses 100% of donations to provide relief and support for front-line responders. Donors can contribute by texting RRF4TX25 to 71777. RRF has started the process to make funds available to those impacted by the floods, a spokesperson said.\nTexas Realtors® Chairman Christy Gessler said the organization is still evaluating how their members, members’ clients and local associations have been impacted by the deadly floods.\n“We’re working with and contributing to community organizations in affected areas to get immediate assistance to those who need it most,” Gessler told RISMedia in a statement.\nFairway Home Mortgage, which has headquarters in Carrollton, Texas, and Madison, Wisconsin, announced it was donating $1 million to relief efforts through Wood Group Gives, one of the lender’s Texas nonprofits.\n“The loss of life and the devastation caused by the floods in Texas this past weekend are difficult to fathom. Our hearts break for the families who are grieving such sudden and unexpected loss,” Fairway’s Regional SVP Marc Wood said in a statement. “Now is the time to live out our commitment to love and serve our communities, and we are committed to doing everything we can to support and help rebuild in the wake of this tragedy.”\nMeanwhile, local real estate agents are pitching in where they can to help. Cord Shiflet, an agent with Moreland Properties in Austin, has posted updates on Facebook to his 50,000 followers as he and others help clear debris from roads and organize volunteers.\nGloria Lorraine Mendoza, a sales agent with Keller Williams City View in San Antonio, described the generosity of the community after her colleague, Dainelle Scott with Keller Williams Boerne in Boerne, Texas, started a donation drive for supplies.\n“You just would not believe the outpouring of support that we’ve gotten,” Mendoza said.\nThe devastation strikes close to home for Keller Williams, which is headquartered in Austin, approximately an hour from the worst-hit areas.\nMeanwhile, Keller Williams Realty International and KW Cares, a nonprofit organization that supports the brokerage’s agent community and their families, announced Tuesday that it donated $150,000 to TEXSAR: Texas Search and Rescue, an Austin-based nonprofit first-responder group, and Mercy Chefs, a faith-based nonprofit that’s providing meals to volunteers and first responders.\nAlexia Rodriguez, executive director of KW Cares, confirmed that all Keller Williams associates in the affected areas have been accounted for and are safe. However, property damage assessments are still ongoing at agents’ homes.\n“We are spreading the word that KW Cares is here,” Rodriguez said. “We’re here to help, especially with emergency grants for people who need lodging because they can’t make it back into their homes, or for long-term assistance if they lost their home or need repairs.”\nAs hopes fade to find survivors, local real estate offices continue pitching in with relief efforts to help their neighbors. Mendoza said her Keller Williams office held a prayer meeting Monday, but their focus wasn’t on business. Instead, they talked about how they’ll help their fellow Texans recover and heal.\n“You can’t stop seeing all of these social media videos and hearing stories, and they just keep getting worse and worse,” Mendoza said. “It’s all so heartbreaking.”",

    "title": "Andy Cohen Blasts Luis Ruelas For “Dark” Comment About Margaret Josephs’ Son On ‘RHONJ’: “I Would Go Absolutely Mental” | Decider",
    "text": "Andy Cohen is adding his voice to the recent backlash Luis Ruelas has been facing since the Real Housewives of New Jersey finale. During a recent appearance on Bitch Sesh: A Real Housewives Breakdown , Cohen admitted that his perspective on the franchise “has shifted a little bit since becoming a dad.” He admitted that he was especially struck by the “dark” comments Ruelas’ made about Margaret Josephs’ family in the RHONJ finale. The episode showed Ruelas and Teresa Giudice discussing how they wanted to face their castmates during “The Last Supper.” “Tell her to stay away from our family,” he told Giudice. “I hope Margaret and her family suffer. I hope her fucking son suffers the way I suffered, the way other people in our family suffered, dealing with a woman like that.” He also called Josephs a “disgusting, vile human being.” While reflecting on the episode, Cohen said, “If someone that I didn’t care for invoked either of my children’s names, I would go…as ‘mellow yellow’ as I usually am, that is what it would take for me.” He then compared himself to RHONJ star Danielle Cabral . “Danielle Cabral’s button is ‘Don’t talk about my husband’s pecs.’ Mine would be, ‘If you mention my children in an unfavorable way,'” he said. “Like, I would go absolutely mental. I assume that’s just very common.” Podcast co-hosts Casey Wilson and Danielle Schneider noted that Giudice and her RHONJ cast mates have “never gone after each other’s children.” “Children have always been of importance to these women,” they pointed out. Ruelas addressed the controversial moment on social media after watching the finale and attempted to explain his perspective. “I was disappointed in my actions in bringing up Margaret Josephs’ son,” he said. “The reason he was even brought up was because I have been dealing with being falsely accused of calling Margaret’s son at his work which is simply not true.” He claimed Josephs had bene spreading a false “narrative” for the past year. “Still, I know better not to bring someone’s child up and it is something I deeply regret so I do want to apologize and acknowledge that I was wrong,” he said. The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 is currently streaming on Peacock .",

    "title": "The Bucs’ defense won’t rest under Todd Bowles | NFL | lancasteronline.com",
    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — The Bucs had just upset the Eagles in a wild-card game Monday night when Todd Bowles was asked how he would celebrate the biggest victory and only playoff win of his head-coaching career. “If I could get eight hours sleep,” he said, “that would be a celebration.” For all of his accomplishments this season — taking a team picked to be among the worst in the NFL with nearly $80 million of dead cap money and discarded quarterback Baker Mayfield to the NFC South title and eliminating the defending NFC champs from the playoffs — Bowles has been overlooked and perhaps underrated in one significant area: He’s also the defensive coordinator and play-caller. “It gets me in a lot earlier, I can tell you that much,” Bowles said. “I used to be a 5:30 (a.m.) guy, and I migrated to a 4:30 guy, and now I’m like a 3:20 guy. You get a lot of work done in the mornings. I still love that part of it. I still enjoy it very much.” Few who labor in the NFL can avoid the insomniac nights during the season. But after Bowles designed a six-man defensive front to shut down the Eagles' run game in a dominating 32-9 win, the message is clear: Don’t sleep on the Bucs. While he may not have many believers in his abilities as a head coach despite back-to-back division titles, the game was a reminder that Bowles remains one of the best defensive minds in the NFL over the last dozen years. He provided a master class on defensive creativity against Philadelphia. In their first meeting, the Eagles rushed 40 times for 201 yards, owning nearly an 18-minute advantage in time of possession. So Bowles committed more resources to the run game, adding two more defensive linemen to the front that already included outside linebackers Shaquil Barrett and Yaya Diaby. Whenever the Eagles went to 12 personnel — two tight ends and one running back — Bowles played K.J. Britt at inside linebacker instead of Devin White. “He’s probably our best run-thumper,” Bowles said. Bowles also knew he needed more man-to-man coverage to go with cornerbacks Carlton Davis and Jamel Dean to protect against the pass, so he moved second-year corner Zyon McCollum to safety, where he was able to lock down tight ends and slot receivers. “We try to find out what best suits us and what works best to defend against the other team,” Bowles said. “Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. You’re constantly trying to do things to win the ballgame. You definitely don’t try to do the same thing you’ve done when you got your head beat in.” Bowles’ adjustment worked as well as could ever be expected, rivaling the Bucs’ effort against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in their 31-9 win three seasons ago in Super Bowl 55. The Eagles were held to a season-low 42 yards rushing. Quarterback Jalen Hurts was limited to 5 yards on one carry. More impressively, the Eagles were 0 for 9 on third down and 0 for 2 on fourth down. “It’s just math, the way it was, and eliminating space, that’s really all it was,” said Bucs co-defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers. “We kind of told (the Eagles) to do something that maybe they didn’t want to do, and that’s what we were saying. They were going to be hard-headed about it, and we had to be hard-headed the other way.” When it comes to the postseason, since 2020 Bowles’ defense has been elite. It is first in quarterback hits (53), second in tackles for loss (37) and second in sacks (18). ”We get in there as coaches and we see what we can get away with based off of what we’ve got to protect,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to protect certain things as well. We don’t go in there and try to create and recreate football. I’m sure every blitz has been run, every front has been seen, whether it was years from now or whether it’s right now. We didn’t create any of these plays.” The Lions present new problems for the Bucs. In their first meeting, running back Jahmyr Gibbs did not play and David Montgomery left early with a rib injury. Tampa Bay also hasn’t had the most success against quarterback Jared Goff. In three games against the Bucs, including two with the Rams, Goff has averaged more than 415 yards and 2.3 touchdown passes, though he has thrown five interceptions. But the Bucs defense also is better, because rookies Diaby and Caljah Kancey have developed as starting players. “I think we’ve gotten tougher over the course of the past few weeks,” Bowles said. “Everybody has finally gotten back and is playing at the same time. We’ve been subbing guys in and out of there — a lot of guys have been playing. If you add the young guys with that, there was a lot of consternation going on there. The communication has gotten a lot better. Everybody is trusting the guy next to him, and they’re playing for each other.” Britt said Bowles brings something different to the game plan each week based on the opponent, and it has kept players both challenged and excited “I do love it. I come into work on my tippy toes,” Britt said. “I have to dive in. When we get off work, that doesn’t mean you’re off. I go home, and you can ask my fiance, I’m busy. I’m busy in the playbook. I don’t want to be that guy (who’s unprepared), so I’m trying to make sure that I know the game plan the best I can.” About half the head coaches in the NFL are the primary play-callers on their team, most of them on offense. Bowles isn’t the only one who’s sleep-deprived. A victory Sunday, which would send the Bucs to the NFC championship game, would be a dream come true for the 60-year-old, who says he doesn’t have many years left in the league. “I’m not going to make 70,” Bowles said. “I can tell you that right now. I guarantee you I’m not making 70.” He hopes the Bucs have miles to go before he sleeps. ©2024 Tampa Bay Times. Visit tampabay.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "Caracas, 18 ene (EFE).- El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, expresó este jueves que la llamada \"revolución bolivariana\", en referencia al chavismo, tendrá una \"gran victoria\" en las elecciones presidenciales, previstas para el segundo semestre de este año -cuya fecha no ha sido anunciada-, en las que el mandatario aún no ha confirmado si competirá.\n\"Cuando toque (la elección presidencial), tocará. Nosotros, nervios de acero, calma y cordura, máxima movilización, preparación de fuerzas y, con el favor de Dios, ir el día que toque a tener la gran victoria, una de las grandes victorias\", dijo en un acto transmitido por el canal estatal VTV.\nEl jefe de Estado reiteró que este año habrá elecciones presidenciales \"con sanciones (o) sin sanciones\" y -sostuvo- el \"pueblo venezolano tendrá una nueva gran victoria este año\" para \"despejar el camino al 2030 y más allá\".\n\"Tengan la seguridad de eso, pero tendremos que ir despejando el camino de maldades\", dijo Maduro, quien agregó que la nación no aceptará \"chantaje\" de \"nadie en el mundo\".\nEl mandatario dijo recientemente que considera todavía \"prematuro\" anunciar si buscará o no un tercer sexenio en el poder.\nEntretanto, el equipo de la candidata presidencial de la principal coalición opositora, María Corina Machado, anunció el miércoles el inicio de su campaña de cara a los comicios, en los que esperan que pueda participar la líder antichavista.\nSobre la exdiputada pesa una inhabilitación dictada por la Contraloría que le impide ocupar cargos públicos de elección popular hasta 2030, una medida que espera sea levantada a través de un mecanismo acordado entre el chavismo y la PUD para la revisión de este tipo de casos.

    "title": "Powerful photo of damaged church in western North Carolina reflects resiliency after Helene",
    "text": "Halls Chapel Baptist Church showed signs of life despite destruction BURNSVILLE, N.C. (WBTV) - With much of western North Carolina still recovering from Helene, a powerful photo has gone semi-viral after a church was damaged in Yancey County. Like many other communities in the mountains, Yancey County was hit hard when Helene passed through on Friday, Sept. 27. The county has reported the second-most deaths in North Carolina with 11. Only Buncombe County, where Asheville is, has more. Yancey County was wrought with devastation, leaving homes and properties destroyed. Halls Chapel Baptist Church , located along the South Toe River in Burnsville, was not immune to the damage. The tiny, white-siding church was formerly part of a picturesque scene, nestled at the bottom of a hill with tall trees behind it and the river running in front of it. After Helene, though, the building was left in pieces. Photos of the church show major damage. The front awning was ripped off during the storm, and at least three walls were essentially blown out, leaving gaping holes behind. Despite the severe damage, the church presented signs of life and resiliency. A makeshift sign, made out of what looks like a bedsheet, read “SERVICE 11 AM SUNDAY.” A flag still hung from the front railing, and the steeple still stood high in the mountain air. So, perhaps, in some ways it still is picturesque. Pictures of the church were shared on Facebook by a woman whose fiancé and son took a helicopter to deliver a generator and other supplies to the area. In her post, the woman wrote, “You can wash away their belongings, destroy their homes, lose all security and access to transportation or food. Folks...you can’t take away your faith and spirituality.” The viral photo has been shared more than 10,000 times since it was posted on Oct. 4, with many commenters focusing on the resiliency the picture shows. Other photos were posted later. “Incredible devastation! But incredible strength!” one person commented. “At that service I bet they will be thankful!” another comment read. “After all that they have been through. A good reminder that no matter how bad it gets there is always something to be thankful for.” Others called the church’s resiliency “a touching moment,” and many offered their prayers and condolences. “This is the time when people need to gather together to praise God and support each other,” one commenter wrote. “I imagine there will be many people there come Sunday morning.” “The devil sent a storm to destroy their church and faith,” the original author said in a separate post . “It certainly didn’t touch their faith.” The woman said she has asked her fiancé to take her to the tiny, white-siding church when it is rebuilt. A fund has been set up to help with the rebuilding efforts. As of Friday morning, nearly $3,000 had been raised. Those wishing to give toward the rebuild can do so here .
