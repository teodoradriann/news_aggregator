    "text": "Tottenham defender Pedro Porro celebrates after scoring against Burnley / © AFP\nPedro Porro's sublime strike fired Tottenham to a hard-fought 1-0 win over stubborn Burnley in the FA Cup third round on Friday.\nPorro bagged his first goal this season with just 12 minutes left in north London to spare Tottenham the prospect of an unwanted trip to Turf Moor for a replay.\nTottenham's progress to the fourth round made it five wins from their last six games in all competitions as they continue to bounce back from their autumn slump.\nCoach Ange Postecoglou said this week that it is Tottenham's ambition to win a trophy like the FA Cup \"every year\".\nWithout a major triumph since winning the 2008 League Cup, Tottenham fans would gladly take any silverware at present, no matter the competition.\nThey won the last of their eight FA Cups in 1991 and Postecoglou would dearly love to mark his first season in charge by ending that long wait for a ninth.\n\"We were a little bit wasteful in the final third. The way the game was going we needed something special from someone and Pedro delivered. He's been outstanding all year,\" Postecoglou said.\n\"Cup games are a unique beast and we're through to the next round so that's the main thing.\"\nThe road to Wembley started for Tottenham without Son Heung-min, who is on Asian Cup duty with South Korea, and Pape Sarr, who has departed to play for Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations.\nPostecoglou's team were the dominant side even without Son and Sarr.\nRicharlison dragged his shot wide of the far post after slaloming through the Burnley defence in the early stages.\nBrennan Johnson's curler was pushed away by Burnley keeper Arijanet Muric, who also saved well from Richarlison.\nGiovani Lo Celso opened the second half with a long-range shot that was repelled by the over-worked Muric.\nTottenham pushed hard in the closing stages, with Muric saving again from Johnson before the breakthrough finally arrived.\nMuric had been in such good form that it was going to take something special to beat him and Porro duly delivered in the 78th minute.\nAfter winning back possession in the Burnley half, the Spanish defender took aim from the right-hand side of the area and unfurled a ferocious shot that bent into the far corner as Muric stood rooted to the spot.\nBurnley's exit leaves Vincent Kompany's second bottom side free to focus on their fight for Premier League survival.\n- Doyle rescues Wolves -\nTen-man Wolves rescued a 1-1 draw at Brentford thanks to Tommy Doyle's stunning strike.\nWolves midfielder Joao Gomes was sent off after just nine minutes for an ugly studs-up challenge on Christian Norgaard.\nNeal Maupay fired Brentford ahead when he rifled into the top corner after Wolves failed to clear a 41st minute free-kick.\nBut Doyle equalised for the four-time FA Cup winners in the 64th minute with a blistering drive from the edge of the area.\nThe draw ended Brentford's run of five successive defeats and Wolves' spell of three consecutive wins, which had included a 4-1 victory over the Bees in December.\nFulham ground out a 1-0 win against Championship strugglers Rotherham at Craven Cottage.\nThe Cottagers have a League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool on Wednesday, so Marco Silva prioritised the trip to Anfield as he made eight changes from the New Year's Eve win over Arsenal.\nSilva's reserves were still strong enough to leave Rotherham without an away victory since November 2022 as Bobby De Cordova-Reid bagged the winner from the edge of the area in the 24th minute.",

Esto afecta a la democracia, y mientras dure la represión política no existirá ninguna normalidad posible\", ha añadido Puigdemont en X.\nEl expresidente de la Generalitat, que se encuentra en Bruselas (Bélgica) desde otoño de 2017, todavía no puede regresar a Cataluña con garantías de no ser detenido después de que el Tribunal Supremo haya decidido no aplicarle la ley de amnistía, si bien ha asegurado que estará presente en el primer debate de investidura que se celebre en el Parlament.\nA pesar del regreso de Rovira, Puigdemont considera que el independentismo todavía está \"lejos\" de tener \"las condiciones que permitan hacer política con normalidad\".\n\"Que de alguna manera podáis recuperar los años y los meses que os han robado, y que nos pongamos a trabajar lo más rápido posible. Porque hay mucho trabajo pendiente\", ha expresado. EFE\nsjs/pll/lml",

    "text": "Maybe a Message from Above Can Offer Hope LOS ANGELES, CA - December 28, 2023 - “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest.\nAnd most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.\nWhere to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God.\nDr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org\nMost of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct quotes from the Real Reality, and this is one such quote pertaining to war:\n\"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals …\nAll the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?”\nAnd this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer:\n“Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\"\nThe question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace.\nDr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org).\nAn example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website:\n\"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\"\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Ascot Media Group, Inc.\nContact Person: Gloria Gonzalez\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 281.333.3507\nAddress: Post Office Box 2394\nCity: Friendswood\nState: TX 77549\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.ascotmedia.com/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "The Los Angeles Fire Department said on Wednesday that \"31 persons, all believed to be tunnel workers, have been safely removed from the tunnel alive without visible injury.\"Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images 31 workers have been rescued from a collapsed tunnel in Los Angeles. The trapped workers were working on an 18-foot wastewater tunnel late on Wednesday. Over 100 responders were deployed for the rescue operation, said Karen Bass, mayor of Los Angeles. ADVERTISEMENT The Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement late Wednesday that the cave-in happened at an underground excavation site around five to six miles south of the tunnel's sole entry point.\nThe tunnel was being constructed for municipal wastewater management, the fire department said.\nTrapped workers were able to \"scramble with some effort\" over a tall pile of soil and meet their colleagues on the other side of the collapse, then take a tunnel vehicle to the entry point, more than five miles away, said the fire department.\nADVERTISEMENT Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in an X post on Wednesday local time that all the workers trapped in the Wilmington tunnel were out and accounted for.\n\"I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are LA's true heroes,\" Bass wrote on X.\nBass said in an earlier X post that more than 100 Los Angeles Fire Department responders had been deployed to the site during the rescue exercise.\nMichael Chee, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, told Business Insider that 27 of the 31 extracted workers were treated for minor injuries.\n\"A full engineering and safety assessment will take place immediately. There is no detail as to the exact cause of the collapse at this time and no estimate for when work will resume until the tunnel is inspected, cleared, and deemed safe for operations,\" Chee added.\nADVERTISEMENT The tunnel project was part of a $630.5 million contract awarded in January 2019 to Dragados USA, a firm known for its tunneling work for large-scale construction projects.\nThe Los Angeles County Sanitation District and ACS Group, the parent company of Dragados USA, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI.\nThis is a developing story.

    "title": "Gerry Lopez on the Life-Changing Benefits of Practicing Yoga",
    "text": "Gerry Lopez is a surf legend. Mr. Pipeline, as he’s known. Without him, surfing wouldn’t be what it is today , and as he ages, he maintains that zen-like calmness that showed up so well in the barrel. He’s a longtime yogi, and espouses the benefits of it to anyone who will listen, which is why Manduka partnered up with him to create a line of yoga gear. Lopez attributes much of his focus, health, and success to his love affair with yoga, and in the short film above, he dives into what it is that he loves so much about it. “I think mostly just being more flexible, in all ways. If you just give it a try, you’ll find that the stiffness is really up here,” he said, tapping his head . “Ultimately, yoga is looking for you to gain control of your mind. I think when we’re able to do that, a lot of our problems will be solved.” For Lopez, there are a lot of similarities between surfing and yoga. “When you’re doing it, you’re so focused,” he said of surfing. “When you’re doing it, you go into a very meditative state of mind. I found it in surfing, but I can always find it on my mat, too.” Lopez has a wonderful outlook on life and aging in general. He’s aware of the natural stages everyone goes through, and he’s not fighting to stay in the past. Yoga is a big part of that. “Everybody goes through life at one stage,” he explained. “The first stage is being a student, trying to learn. Then you maybe become a warrior and eventually that leads into you becoming a teacher. Hopefully you finish up by becoming a priest.” Gerry doesn’t think he’s quite at the priest stage yet, although many might disagree, but thinks he’s becoming a teacher. “I think I’ve left the warrior stage behind, and hopefully I’m some kind of teacher,” he laughed. “I think the important part about embracing yoga as the complete lifestyle that it is that at some point you realize that you have a responsibility to that and part of that responsibility is just becoming that teacher; that person that helps to introduce or just show other people that the path of yoga is a pretty nice way to walk down life.”",
