    "title": "Dan Russoman covered high school sports for nearly 30 years",
    "text": "Dan Russoman’s best story was the one about his own fight for survival.\nDan covered high school sports for The Hammonton Gazette weekly newspaper for nearly 30 years. He was diagnosed with cancer in April.\nDan detailed his fight against the disease in a series of riveting, heartbreaking and inspirational Facebook posts.\nOn April 22, he wrote:\nLong road ahead, and I’m sure there will be breakthroughs and setbacks, but I’m ready. Be sure to say hello if you see me around. Once again the support has been incredibly humbling and tremendously appreciated.\nThe posts stopped June 30.\nDan died July 16. He was 56.\nThe best thing about covering sports is the people — the players, the coaches, the fans and, yes, the sportswriters.\nPeople are also reading…\nWe sportswriters spend a lot of time together. Dan was a constant presence at Hammonton High School and St. Joseph Academy games.\nOver the past 30 years, I spent more Saturdays with Dan covering St. Joe football than I did with my own family.\nI couldn’t wait to get to the field and exchange some off-the-record gossip and insights with Dan about the local high school scene.\nDan covered high school sports the right way. He didn’t shy away from the controversial story, but he celebrated the athletes and coaches. He understood they are, at heart, just students and teachers, not professionals. Dan not only wrote stories, he took pictures, too.\nI guarantee that Dan sacrificed and missed family events to cover the Blue Devils and Wildcats.\nI don’t know them, but I guarantee Dan’s family didn’t mind because that dedication to his job is part of what made Dan, Dan. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and three daughters — Jessica, Casey and Samantha.\nAway from work, Dan loved to root for the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Vikings. He specialized in ranking Rita's water ice flavors.\nDan covered Hammonton High School athletic director Chris Sacco as a player, coach and athletic director.\n“This is a tough one,” Sacco said. “He was a great guy. He was a huge part of the local sports community and earned the respect of coaches, players and fans. He was a great reporter, but an even better man.”\nDan posted about more than just his cancer the past few months. He highlighted the achievements of others. He thanked the hundreds of people in the Hammonton community and all over South Jersey who reached out to support him.\nAs the disease wore on him, Dan’s posts were brutally honest:\nOn June 19, he wrote:\nQuestions stick in my head without answers. Will I ever completely be out of this bed? Will I be able to get back to work? Enjoy a “normal” life again? And, of course, will I survive this at all?\nI last saw Dan on April 1. We watched the Hammonton baseball team beat Ocean City 6-2.\nAfter the game, we interviewed Blue Devils freshman Trevor West, who had allowed one hit and no runs in four innings. We laughed as the 5-foot-4, 140-pound West told us how he watched YouTube to learn how to throw the off-speed pitches that kept the Ocean City hitters off-balance. It was the type of story you only find in high school sports and the type Dan chronicled for three decades.\nThe brief period between that day and the date of Dan’s death should remind us all — especially the athletes and coaches of Hammonton and St. Joseph — of how much each practice, game and day needs to be relished.\nOr as Dan posted on June 4 after spending his first night out of the hospital since May 12:\nTossed and turned all night but there has never been a more beautiful sight than the sun coming through the front windows this morning. When I saw it, I cried tears of gratitude.\nRest in peace, Dan, rest in peace.",

    "title": "United Cup: China produce upset to topple Czech Republic with back-to-back singles wins | The West Australian",
    "text": "China have caused an upset on day two of the United Cup at RAC Arena, winning both singles matches to secure victory over the fifth-seeded Czech Republic. Rising Chinese star Qinwen Zheng toppled world number seven and reigning Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-1 2-6 6-1 in a roller-coaster women’s singles match. It came after her compatriot Zhizhen Zhang had downed Jiri Lehecka 6-7 6-3 6-4 to give China an early advantage in their best-of-three tie. The victory will put the ninth-seeded China in a promising position in Group E ahead of their New Year’s Eve clash with Serbia and superstar Novak Djokovic. Vondrousova was the favourite heading into her clash with 21-year-old Zheng, but it was the latter who ruthlessly dominated the first set. Zheng broke twice and held her own serve in the opening four games, before staving off a break point to go 5-0 up. Vondrousova struggled to get going as she failed to hit a single winner in the opening set, Zheng capitalising on the world number seven’s 11 unforced errors to claim the first set in just 29 minutes. The Czech star stirred in the second set, a reversal of sorts, recovering from losing her serve in the opening game to win the next three games. A Zheng double fault handed Vondrousova the second set, but the world number 15 overcame the setback with a clinical performance in the third set. Cheered on by a predominantly pro-China crowd, an amped-up Zheng broke in the first game of the third set as an erratic Vondrousova faltered, finding the net four times in a single game to hand her opponent a 4-1 lead which she did not relinquish. Earlier, men’s world number 58 Zhang upset Lehecka - ranked 27 spots above him - 6-7 6-3 6-4 in two hours and 20 minutes. Both players had chances to break early in the opening set, with Lehecka taking his in the third game, before saving two break points from Zhang the following game. With Lehekca serving for the first set at 5-4 up, Zhang secured a break to level the scores, but the Czech world number 31 broke back immediately before serving out the opening set. Zhang raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set, causing plenty of issues for Lehecka and keeping his higher-ranked opponent at bay to send the match to a deciding set. It was the seventh game which proved crucial as Zhang picked up a crucial break to establish a 4-3 lead. Serving for the match at 5-4, Zhang had three match points on offer and while Lehecka saved one, a sumptuous sliced volley on the second ended the Czech’s challenge. All four singles players will be back in action for the mixed-doubles in the afternoon.",

    "title": "Letter from China: From \"cave dwellers\" to \"apple moguls\"",
    "text": "by Xinhua writer Wu Ziyu YAN'AN, Shaanxi, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Before arriving at the apple orchards on the upper reaches of Nangou Village on the Loess Plateau, I was already amazed by the greenery along the winding mountain road. The village, located in the city of Yan'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, used to invoke pictures of bleak ridges and valleys of yellow earth. But outside the window of our SUV, the same ridges and ditches are flourishing with trees, a result of decades of reforestation and ecological preservation. On a small square that leads to the orchards, a red and shiny apple-shaped structure caught my attention. The humble fruit is the village's top specialty product, and has played a key role in transforming the village over the years. Zhang Runsheng, secretary of the Communist Party of China branch in the village, greeted us on the square and led us on a tour in the orchards. Looking around, the seemingly endless row of apple trees was a sight to behold. Had it not been for the steep slope right next to the concrete road surrounding the orchards, I would have almost forgotten I was still on a mountain ridge. \"We have 3,160 mu (about 210.7 hectares) of apple orchards in the village now,\" said Zhang. He added that in the orchards, 1,060 mu utilize short-stalk close planting techniques and refined management methods. Among the apple trees, I spotted a pillar-like device. \"This is the automated orchard monitoring system,\" said Zhang. \"Every once in a while, experts dispatched by local agricultural authorities will come to analyze the readings and determine the orchard's situation.\" He said that apart from a few activities that require manual work, such as bagging apples, the orchards' operation was highly mechanized. For urban residents of Yan'an and beyond, the village is a popular attraction for its apple orchards and rural tourism. Last year, the per capita income of Nangou villagers was 21,500 yuan (about 3,017 U.S. dollars), a ten percent increase from the year before. However, about a decade ago, the future of the village was still dim. Back in 2013, a heavy rainfall that affected the entire Yan'an dealt a heavy blow to the village, causing great economic losses. \"Some villagers still lived in cave-dwellings then,\" said Zhang, referring to a type of traditional housing on the Loess Plateau. \"The downpour damaged some caves and even collapsed a few. Many villagers lost their homes.\" Zhang, who had started a moderately successful real estate business in downtown Yan'an, was then invited by his fellow villagers to help with the village's reconstruction. The efficient work style of his team was appreciated by fellow villagers, and he was elected the village's Party chief later. With disaster relief support and subsidies from local government, the village solved the housing problem. However, villagers still lacked a stable source of income. \"To turn our lives around, developing local industry is a must,\" said Zhang, who was born into a poor family in the village and had to go to the urban areas for livelihood. According to him, the decision to grow apples was made after extensive discussions with villagers and study trips to other famed apple-producing areas in Shaanxi. Local authorities were very supportive of the development of apple growing, said Zhang. \"They provided us with much-needed planting techniques, and subsidized us in fields such as hail prevention, insecticide, and water-saving irrigation,\" he said, pointing at the hail nets that hang over the apple trees. In one orchard, I met 69-year-old apple grower Ma Jintu. \"Nangou was once ridiculed as a 'bachelor village,' for few women from other areas were willing to marry into our village,\" said Ma, recalling the village's poor transportation and hard life in the past. \"All these changes in the village was beyond my imagination,\" Ma said. Nangou is among numerous places across the country that owe their transformation to developing local specialty industries in the rural revitalization drive. Just like Nangou apples, oranges from Jiangxi Province's Ganzhou, strawberries from Dandong in Liaoning Province and many other specialty products have all made a name for themselves on the market. \"Our mountain organic apples are now sold across the country for their exceptional taste and nutrition,\" Zhang said. He added that many foreign customers adopt apple trees at an annual fee of 500 yuan a tree, which further expands the income source of the village. On top of a viewing platform that overlooks the village, I could see its entire landscape: apart from the orchards on the ridge, several cottages and what seemed to be a racetrack were also clearly visible on a flat opening at the foot of the hill. \"The shacks are local hostels, and the track is for dirt bikes,\" Zhang told us. As the village attracts more visitors with its apple industry, it is now exploring ways to create a diverse experience for tourists. Opposite the viewing platform, a sign that reads \"lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets\" stood on the hill. From what I have seen, there isn't a more appropriate description of the village's development.

    "text": "Zach Wilson. While the Denver Broncos&#039; first unofficial depth chart of the summer suggested that former New York Jets flop Zach Wilson could emerge as the winner of a summer competition for the team&#039;s starting quarterback job, he worked with the third-team offense in recent practices behind rookie Bo Nix and journeyman Jarrett Stidham. Wilson spoke with reporters on Wednesday about what appears to be a harsh reality regarding his situation heading into Denver&#039;s preseason opener at the Indianapolis Colts this coming Sunday afternoon. &quot;I think when you really sit down and think about it, I&#039;ve got no control over that,&quot; Wilson explained, as shared by Aric DiLalla of the Broncos&#039; website. &quot;… I think the worst you can do is let it affect you, so the best you can do is just say, &#039;OK, I&#039;m going to take what I get and go out there and do the best I can and put my best foot forward and try my best and try to help this team do the best it can getting down the field and complete some passes.&#039; I think that&#039;s all you&#039;ve got to worry about.&quot; Denver acquired Wilson from the Jets shortly before the Broncos made Nix the 12th overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft. The Broncos unsurprisingly later declined to pick up the fifth-year option attached to Wilson&#039;s rookie contract, meaning he&#039;s on track to reach free agency after the upcoming season. Training camp practices have indicated that Wilson is Denver&#039;s third-choice option at the position, but head coach Sean Payton continues to insist he is &quot;not there yet with the quarterback relative to who’s going to be the starter.&quot; It&#039;s believed Payton won&#039;t announce a final decision about his QB1 before Denver finishes its second preseason game, a matchup versus the Green Bay Packers, on Aug. 18. For now, Wilson is focusing on trying to close the gap in the competition. &quot;Just go out there and get the ball out of my hands [and] let the playmakers that we have go make some plays,&quot; Wilson said about what he hopes to accomplish against the Colts. As of Thursday morning, FanDuel Sportsbook continued to list Nix as the betting favorite at -200 odds to start over Stidham (+154) and Wilson (+7000) for Denver&#039;s Week 1 game at the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 8. It remains to be seen if Wilson can do anything to leapfrog Nix on the depth chart over the next month. Want more articles like this?
