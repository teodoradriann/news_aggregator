    "title": "US said to back strikes on Iran targets in Iraq, Syria as Gaza truce hopes rise | The Straits Times",
    "text": "WASHINGTON - The planned targets for US strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the [killing of three US soldiers by a drone in Jordan](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/us-approves-strikes-against-iranian-targets-in-iraq-syria-report) include “Iranian personnel and facilities”, CBS News reported on Feb 1, citing American officials. The United States has assessed that the drone, which also wounded more than 40 people, was made by Iran, four US officials told Reuters. Sources said Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards were pulling senior officers out of Syria. The CBS report follows days of conjecture about how Washington would retaliate after three US soldiers were killed on Saturday in a strike on their base. The fatalities were the first US deaths in an [escalation of violence across the Middle East](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/explainer-iran-and-its-proxies-and-widening-violence-in-the-middle-east) since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October. Even as fighting has intensified this week, diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave have accelerated. Qatari and Egyptian mediators presented Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, with the first concrete proposal for an extended halt to fighting, agreed with Israel and the US at talks in Paris last week. A Palestinian official close to the negotiations told Reuters the text envisages a first phase of 40 days, during which fighting would cease while Hamas freed remaining civilians among the more than 100 hostages it still holds. Further phases would see the handover of Israeli soldiers and bodies of dead hostages. Such a long pause would be a first since Oct 7, [when Hamas fighters attacked Israel,](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/sirens-warning-of-incoming-rockets-sound-around-gaza-near-tel-aviv) killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza. Health officials in the enclave said on Feb 1 the confirmed Palestinian death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble. A Palestinian official said Hamas was unlikely to reject the proposal outright, but would demand guarantees that fighting would not resume, something Israel has not agreed to. Reports of ceasefire deal are denied A positive-sounding speech by a Qatari spokesman at Johns Hopkins University in Washington briefly triggered some celebrations in Gaza - and a drop in the price of crude oil. But a Qatari official in Doha told Reuters there was no ceasefire deal yet, and that Hamas had “received the proposal positively” but not responded yet. And Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, told Reuters: “We have received the proposal that was put together in Paris but we haven’t yet given a response to any of the parties.” “We can’t say that the current stage of negotiation is zero and at the same time we can’t say that we have reached an agreement.” Celebratory firing into the air and cheering in central and southern Gaza were soon suppressed by an air strike on a house in Gaza’s main southern city, Khan Younis, that wounded 13 people, according to hospital officials. Israel started a huge ground assault last week to capture Khan Younis, and combat has also surged in northern areas that Israel claimed to have subdued weeks ago. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces had now dismantled the Hamas brigade in Khan Younis, and that they had killed 10,000 Palestinian fighters and wounded the same number again since the war began nearly four months ago. He said those forces would now press on to Rafah on the enclave’s southern edge, where more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are sheltering, mainly cold and hungry in makeshift tents and public buildings. Residents said Israeli forces had pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis overnight, and stepped up attacks close to Rafah. Mr Osama Ahmed, 49, a father of five from Gaza City now sheltering in western Khan Younis, said there had been fierce resistance in the city, and relentless bombardment from air, ground and sea as Israeli tanks advanced. “They haven’t entered deep into Al-Mawasi where we live but every day they get closer,” he told Reuters by phone. “All we want is a ceasefire now.” US puts pressure on Israel Appeals to Israel from its main ally, the United States, show little sign of having succeeded in easing the plight of Gaza’s civilians. Washington is stepping up indirect pressure, however. US President Joe Biden issued an executive order that aims to punish Jewish settlers who attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in a surge of violence triggered by the war in Gaza. Mr Biden is also under pressure to respond firmly to the killing of US soldiers - which Washington says bears the “footprints” of Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia based in neighbouring Iraq - without igniting a wider war with Iran. That group said on Wednesday it was suspending military action against US forces to avoid embarrassing Baghdad. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who have lost more than half a dozen of their members to Israeli strikes since December, are pulling their senior officers out of Syria, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Iranian advisers assist armed groups in both Iraq, where the US has around 2,500 troops, and Syria, where it has 900. The CBS report quoted US officials as saying weather would be a factor in the timing of the retaliatory US strikes as Washington preferred good visibility to guard against the risk of hitting civilians. Further afield, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen, has attacked shipping in the Red Sea in what it says is solidarity with Gaza, drawing retaliatory strikes from the United States and Britain. Overnight, the US military said it had hit up to 10 drones in Yemen being prepared for launch, while a US Navy ship downed three Iranian-made drones and a Houthi anti-ship missile. Two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen hit the water rather than their likely target, the Liberian-flagged, Bermuda-owned freighter M/V KOI, US Central Command said.

    "text": "BALTIMORE COUNTY, Ill. -- Baltimore County police said a disgruntled ex-athletics director used AI to frame his high school's principal by generating a fake recording of racist rant in his voice. Police Chief Robert McCullough said his department worked with the FBI and forensic experts from the University of California at Berkeley to investigate the recording that was originally circulated on social media in January 2024. The audio recording purported to capture Pikesville High School principal Eric Eiswert \"spewing racial and antisemitic insults about staff and students,\" WMAR-TV reported . McCullough announced Thursday that their investigation found that \"Dazhon Darien, the school's athletic director, produced the recording to retaliate against Principal Eiswert, who had initiated a probe into the mishandling of school funds.\" Darien was arrested at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport Thursday morning, McCullough said, on an outstanding warrant. He now faces charges that include stalking, disruption of school operations and retaliation against a witness. He is currently in custody and being held on $5,000 bond. WMAL reported that Eiswert and Darien started having problems after Darien became athletics director in July 2023 and terminated a long-standing coach without Eiswert's approval. WMAL reported Darien was also the subject of a potential threat investigation initiated by Eiswert after he authorized a $1,916 payment to his roommate and Pikesville High School junior varsity basketball coach while claiming that she was acting as an assistant soccer coach for the girls soccer team even though that coach had never assisted during the soccer season. In court documents, it's alleged he submitted the payment by bypassing proper procedures.",

    "text": "By Liz Lee\nBEIJING (Reuters) – Year-end holidaymakers across China were bracing for possible transport disruptions after the weather bureau on Friday warned that heavy fog and haze would shroud areas from Hebei province in the north to southern Shanghai for the next 24 hours.\nThe Central Meteorological Observatory issued its first red alert for fog since 2017. Conditions were expected to improve from Saturday evening, when a cold wave of air is expected to blow over the country.\nSevere foggy conditions were expected in parts of northern province Hebei, central province Henan, eastern provinces Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong as well as in the municipalities Shanghai and Chongqing from Friday morning, the National Meteorological Centre said.\nDense fog in predicted in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai leading to low visibility of less than 200 metres, and less than 50 metres in some areas.\nIn the north and areas between the Yellow River and Huai River, light to moderate haze is forecast, with heavy haze affecting Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan.\nThe severe weather was due to high humidity and poor atmospheric diffusion conditions, the forecaster said.\nChina has experienced a year of climate extremes.\nLast week, most of the country was hit by a cold snap that rewrote records with sub-freezing temperatures, in contrast to the summer, when scorching heat that breached 52 degree Celsius (125.6 Fahrenheit) in the northwest blistered the country.\nSummer storms also brought record rainfall to Beijing and flooding elsewhere.\nOn Friday, the central observatory told the public to tune into weather and traffic alerts, and advised them to reduce time outdoors. Residents in parts of Shandong, Anhui and in Jiangsu should avoid going out unless necessary, it added.\n“You can’t see clearly the road conditions and traffic lights ahead,” the observatory said on social media.\nIn Shanghai, some ferry routes were temporarily suspended and some sections of highways, as well as a bridge to a container port, were temporarily closed. At the city’s Bund waterfront, a thick grey fog all but obscured the colourful skyscrapers across from it.\nIn Jiangsu, some sections of several expressways remained shut since Thursday evening, while Hebei and Henan temporarily closed segments of multiple highways on Friday morning, citing weather conditions, according to state television CCTV and provincial capital authorities said.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee and Shanghai newsroom; editing by Miral Fahmy)",

Los laboratorios farmacéuticos fabricantes de los medicamentos oncológicos Endoxan, Darzalex y Vectibix, detectaron que circulan y se venden en el país lotes falsificados y en otros casos, están destinados para mercados en otros países, no en el mexicano. La Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios (Cofepris) emitió una alerta a la población para advertir sobre posibles daños provocados por el consumo de dichos productos.\nSe trata de Endoxan 1 gramo (ciclofosfamida) en presentación 1 vial de 50 mililitros (ml), polvo para solución, con número de lote 2C266E y caducidad en febrero 2025, el cual fue destinado exclusivamente para comercialización en Centroamérica. Es producido por la empresa Baxter.\nEl laboratorio Janssen-Cilag informó la agencia reguladora que los lotes DDP1255 para el producto Darzalex 400 miligramos (mg)/20ml, así como EEF2466 y HHT5917 para Darzalex 100 mg/5ml, no se encuentran en su listado, por lo que son falsos.\nEn tanto, el lote MBS2H04 de Darzalex 400 mg/20ml, está destinado sólo para el mercado colombiano, mientras el lote LHS2649 fue desviado de la cadena de suministro original.\nLa empresa Amgen México identificó la comercialización del producto Vectibix (panitumumab) 100mg/5mL, con textos en idioma inglés, con número de lote 323473, caducidad abril 2024; 322580 y 11291 con fecha límite abril 2023, de los cuales no reconoce la importación, distribución y comercialización.\nAl respecto, la Cofepris subrayó que los productos mencionados representan un riesgo para la salud, debido a que se desconocen sus condiciones de fabricación y almacenamiento, por lo cual su seguridad, calidad y eficacia no están garantizadas.\nRecomendó que en caso de contar con alguno de los medicamentos Endoxan, Darzalex y Vectibix con los números de lote mencionados, acuda con un profesional de la salud para que indique el tratamiento a seguir.\nEn caso de haber presentado cualquier reacción adversa o malestar por el suministro de dichos productos, debe reportarlo al correo: [email protected]\nAsimismo, Cofepris exhorta a la población y a personal médico para que, en caso de identificar los productos con las características antes señaladas, evite adquirirlos, y si cuenta con información sobre la posible comercialización, realice la denuncia sanitaria correspondiente en la página electrónica Denuncia Sanitaria.",

That's why we have taken massive measures in response to a serious tip-off.
