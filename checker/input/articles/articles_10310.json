    "text": "YLKI Urges OJK to Cancel New Co-payment Rules for Health Insurance, Not Postpone Them\nReporter\nJuly 3, 2025 | 11:44 am\nTEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI) urges the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to revoke the co-payment rule for health insurance risk sharing. This rule obligates policyholders to bear 10 percent of the claim costs.\nYLKI considers the postponement of the regulation, agreed upon by OJK and the House of Representatives (DPR) in a meeting on Monday, June 30, 2025, as insufficient in protecting consumers. \"And not in line with the initial agreement in the policy,\" said YLKI's Executive Secretary Rio Priambodo in a written statement to Tempo on Wednesday, July 2, 2025. He believes this policy will make consumers think twice before continuing their insurance policies.\nYLKI also requests OJK to involve consumers in policy development. According to Rio, OJK should resolve fundamental issues such as claims processes and hospital services. \"Resolving insurance-related issues will enhance OJK's dignity in the eyes of consumers,\" he said.\nIn a hearing with the DPR, Commission XI member Eric Hermawan asked OJK to postpone the implementation of co-payment until 2027. He believes OJK did not involve the public and did not consult with the DPR before issuing this policy. \"There should be a people-oriented approach. The public should be asked if they want to adopt co-payment. The industry is the one benefiting,\" said Eric.\nCommission XI Chairman Mukhamad Misbakhun asked OJK to change the form of the regulation from a circular letter to an official regulation. \"Should not be a circular letter, but a formal regulation,\" he said. OJK's Executive Director of Insurance Supervision Ogi Prastomiyono stated that OJK will follow the DPR's request.\nPreviously, the Indonesian Life Insurance Association (AAJI) cited the surge in health insurance claims as the reason for the issuance of the co-payment rule. \"Health insurance claims have been increasing from year to year, especially after the pandemic,\" said Head of the Claim and Benefit Department of AAJI, Dian Budiani, in a media gathering in Bogor on Wednesday, June 25, 2025.\nAAJI recorded the claim value in 2021 at Rp 12.11 trillion. This figure increased to Rp 16.67 trillion in 2022, then soared to Rp 20.77 trillion in 2023. In 2024, claims reached Rp 24.18 trillion with 3.79 million beneficiaries.\nAdil Al Hasan contributed to the writing of this article.\nEditor's Choice: DPR and OJK Postpone Controversial Health Insurance Co-Payment Scheme\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

    "text": "NMG and AMG Realtors host day-long ceremony to champion empowerment of all women Sponsored by AMG Realtors On March 8, 2024, the Nation Media Group (NMG), in a landmark partnership with AMG Realtors, took the lead in celebrating women on International Women's Day (IWD) through a spectacular gala dinner that championed the advancements and empowerment of women from all walks of life. A total of 562 women graced the colourful ceremony that was held at the Windsor Golf Hotel & Country Club, Nairobi. The event became a confluence of culture, elegance, and inspiration, perfectly embodying this year's IWD theme of fostering inclusivity. With the dress code set to 'African Glam', the evening was a colourful tapestry of fashion, featuring a host of activities that ranged from networking opportunities and financial masterclasses, to golfing experiences. The dinner was a testament to the power of collaborative initiatives in elevating women's roles in society. The event was graced by notable keynote speakers. They included Kirinyaga County Governor and chairperson of the Council of Governors Anne Waiguru, representing the public sector; and the Managing Director of KCB Bank Kenya, Annastacia Kimtai, representing the private sector. Their inspiring addresses shone a spotlight on the strides women are making in shaping Kenya’s landscape on different fronts. A panel of distinguished women leaders, including Gwen Kinisu of Prudential Life Assurance and Blandina Ijecha Bobson of Oxfam Kenya, shared their profound stories and insights, enriching the conversation around women's challenges and triumphs. Their presence and discourse elevated the evening, inspiring those in attendance to contribute to a more equitable future. AMG Realtors Marketing Manager Rebecca Ngigi, spoke too, saying: “At AMG Realtors, we understand the unique strengths women bring to the real estate market. About 70 percent of our clients are women, and we are cognizant that now more than ever, many women are interested in understanding the nuances of the real estate market to make informed decisions.” She went on: “We sell land that we own. Our prices are all inclusive. We deliver your title deed within 60 days after payment completion. We deliver the title deed to your door step, and we have a permanent residence at AMG Centre. These pillars have enabled us to play a pivotal role in building the confidence of women in their investment endeavours, as well as empowering them with knowledge and guidance they need to thrive. We’ve done this for the last 12 years that we have been in business.” [NMG](https://www.nationmedia.com/) and [AMG Realtors](https://amgrealtors.com/), alongside other partners such as Ecobank Kenya and Prudential, have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to inclusivity through this event. By joining forces, these diverse entities have not only honoured the spirit of International Women's Day, but also set a high standard for corporate support in women's advancement. The gala dinner's overwhelming success was a reflection of the united vision shared by all sponsors – a society that values and uplifts each of its members. It was more than a celebration. It was a clarion call to action, urging continuous support for gender parity and diversity in the professional realm and beyond. As NMG forges ahead with allies like AMG Realtors to spotlight women's achievements, events like the International Women's Day gala dinner are pivotal to cultivating an environment where women's voices are heard and their successes celebrated. Continuing her speech, Ms Ngigi said: “Today, women are increasingly taking charge of their financial futures through real estate investment. At [AMG Realtors](https://amgrealtors.com/), we understand the importance of securing your family’s future by providing ready to build plots such as Juja Prime project, which has recorded an increased uptake by Kenyan women living or working in the diaspora, looking to settle their families back home in secure places with social amenities close by.

    "text": "Nach Statement: Schlagerstar enthüllt Klinikaufenthalt – „Psychosomatisches Problem“\nEs sind Enthüllungen mit Tiefgang: Schlagersänger Eric Philippi spricht erstmals über seine psychischen Probleme und seinen Aufenthalt in einer Klinik.\nKöln – Schlagerstar Eric Philippi (28) hat sich zu einem schwerwiegenden persönlichen Thema geäußert. Nach monatelangem Schweigen macht der Verlobte von Michelle (53) nun öffentlich, warum er sich aus der Öffentlichkeit zurückgezogen hatte. Seine ehrlichen Worte sollen anderen Betroffenen Mut machen und ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches Thema in den Fokus rücken.\nSchlagerstar öffnet sich: Eric Philippi lässt auf Worte Taten folgen\nWie unter anderem wa.de berichtet, hatte Eric Philippi kürzlich über Instagram angekündigt, über „Dinge, die sich immer hinter den Kulissen abgespielt haben“ sprechen zu wollen. Der 28-jährige Schlagerkünstler deutete damals an, dass es jahrelange Kämpfe gegeben habe, während nach außen hin alles perfekt erschien. Seine Fans fragten sich schon länger, warum Eric Philippi immer wieder von der Bildfläche verschwand.\nJetzt hat der Musiker gegenüber der Bild-Zeitung erstmals über seine mentalen Probleme gesprochen. „Ich habe seit langer Zeit ein psychosomatisches Problem, das sich vor allen Dingen durch Panikattacken äußert. Ich konnte nicht mehr am normalen Leben teilnehmen“, erklärte der „Schockverliebt“-Interpret. Anfang des Jahres hatte er sich für drei Monate in eine Privatklinik begeben.\nEric Philippi spricht offen über Panikattacken: Sie verhinderten seine Auftritte\nDie Erkrankung hatte massive Auswirkungen auf die Karriere des Schlagersängers. „Die letzten Auftritte vor meiner Therapie waren kaum noch zu bewältigen und ich konnte gar nicht mehr allein unterwegs sein“, berichtete er weiter. Die Panikattacken begannen mit schwitzigen Händen und einem Puls von 150, gefolgt von Atemnot und der ständigen Angst zu sterben. Diese Symptome machten es zeitweise unmöglich, weiterhin als Entertainer zu arbeiten. Immer wieder hatte der Saarländer Konzerte absagen müssen – teils recht spontan.\nWährend seines Klinikaufenthalts erhielt Eric Philippi Unterstützung von seiner Verlobten Michelle. Die 53-jährige Schlagersängerin besuchte ihn regelmäßig in der Klinik. Rückblickend bezeichnet Philippi die Entscheidung für die Therapie als „eine der besten Entscheidungen meines Lebens“ – ein Schritt, von dem er sich inzwischen wünscht, ihn früher gegangen zu sein. Heute geht es ihm nach eigenen Angaben „so gut wie noch nie“. Übrigens: Die Hochzeit von Michelle und ihrem Eric muss wohl noch ein wenig warten.
