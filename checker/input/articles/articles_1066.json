    "text": "Un fred humit deixarà termòmetres titiritando en gran part de la Comunitat Valenciana a partir d'aquest divendres: gelades prop de la mar\nDurant el dia el mercuri s'anirà recuperant, mentre que les nits seran fredes o molt fredes\nLa Comunitat Valenciana es prepara per a una jornada de temps estable, amb intervals nuvolosos que tendiran a desaparéixer cap a la vesprada, deixant cels majorment rasos en tot el territori valencià. No obstant això, el protagonisme el tindran les baixes temperatures, especialment a l'interior nord, on s'esperen gelades febles a causa d'un descens significatiu de les mínimes.\nLes temperatures al detall\nEn les capitals de província, les temperatures mínimes oscil·laran entre els 6 °C a Castelló de la Plana i els 7 °C a València i Alacant. Les màximes, en canvi, experimentaran un lleuger ascens, aconseguint els 15 °C a Castelló de la Plana i els 17 °C a València i Alacant.\nA l'interior, el fred serà més intens. En zones com Morella, s'esperen mínimes de fins a -2 °C, mentre que altres localitats de l'interior nord registraran valors pròxims als 0 °C. A l'interior sud i zones de menor altitud, com Xàtiva o Requena, les mínimes se situaran entre els 4 °C i els 5 °C.\nPer part seua, en el litoral, localitats com Gandia, Dénia i Benidorm gaudiran de temperatures més suaus, amb màximes que rondaran els 11 °C i 12 °C.\nEl vent de component oest serà fluix, la qual cosa, sumat al cel buidat durant la nit, contribuirà a la pèrdua de calor i al descens de les temperatures nocturnes. Aquest fenomen afavorirà la formació de gelades febles en àmplies zones de l'interior, especialment en àrees muntanyenques i valls resguardades.\nTemps per al cap de setmana en la Comunitat Valenciana\nLa tendència meteorològica apunta a una lleugera recuperació de les màximes en els dies esdevenidors, encara que el fred continuarà sent notable durant les nits. S'espera que el temps estable continue almenys fins al cap de setmana, amb cels buidats i absència de precipitacions.",

    "title": "How to learn to live during the war - Edith Eger, an Auschwitz survivor, gave advice",
    "text": "Trending: How to learn to live during the war. Tips from 94-year-old psychologist Edith Eger, who survived Auschwitz Edith Yeager, a 94-year-old American doctor of psychology who specializes in war trauma, gave some advice on how to learn to live in this terrible time. She survived Auschwitz in her youth, and so all her life she has been analyzing the \"victim\" and \"survivor\" narratives from her own experience and teaching other victims about it. Ukrainians also received some effective advice from her on how to cope with feelings of hatred and hopelessness. Edith Eger told about this in an interview with [NV](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/psihologinya-edit-yeva-eger-pro-travmatizaciyu-pid-chas-viyni-interv-yu-nv-novini-ukrajini-50244679.html) (to see the photo, scroll to the bottom of the page). Learning to live, not to survive To get rid of the minute-by-minute anxiety about the future and the feeling of hopelessness that it is impossible to change the past, the psychologist advises to learn lessons from tragic events and focus on the present. \"It is important to get rid of two things, the first is the feeling of guilt about the past. It is important to get rid of the thoughts that things could have been done differently, because nothing can be changed in the past. The second is worrying about the future, we are constantly worrying about the future, about things that may never happen,\" the commentary says. Get rid of the feeling of guilt According to the expert, the past cannot be changed, but it is necessary to learn how to experience it properly and get rid of guilt. To do this, she advises to \"let all the emotions that have accumulated inside\" through. \"For many years, I have experienced different feelings, and it is important to go through them and give yourself the opportunity to be filled with them-anger, rage, grief. I talk a lot about the triad: \"grieving-feeling-healing\". In order to grieve, it is important to start feeling, to let your feelings manifest,\" said Edith Jaeger. She advised not to position yourself as a victim by asking: \"Why me? Why me?\" but to focus on the fact that you managed to survive the war or survive during the fighting and ask yourself: \"What's next?\" Do not forbid yourself to be happy Edith Jaeger emphasized that \"allowing\" yourself to be happy means controlling your life, where you forbid yourself something, and therefore do not fully experience freedom. In addition, limiting yourself to pleasant little things does not help, but only plays into the hands of the enemy, who came to Ukrainian lands for this purpose. \"Answer yourself the question: how does it help you to deny yourself happiness and joy? How does it help those you love and who love you? Love and guilt cannot coexist. Where guilt appears, love disappears. It is important not to kill love and hope in yourself,\" the psychologist explained. It's normal to hate, but you can't get stuck in this feeling The expert, based on her own experience, revealed that feeling rage and hatred during the war is a normal phenomenon that does not need to be \"hidden\" inside. However, when experiencing negative feelings, it is important not to get stuck in them for a long time. \"It's important to experience feelings and let them come out - to scream, to get mad, to show hatred. But it is important not to get stuck in this manifestation of fierce emotions, because by investing a lot of ourselves in them, we can suddenly distance ourselves from our lives and hide from them in hatred,\" the message says.

    "title": "Institute of Arab and Islamic Art, NYC, presents Bilgé's 'Torn Time'",
    "text": "Institute of Arab and Islamic Art, NYC, presents Bilgé’s ‘Torn Time’\n- Last updated: June 12, 2025 | 10:06\nMuhammad Yusuf, Features Writer\nThe Institute of Arab and Islamic Art (IAIA), founded by Mohammed Rashid Al-Thani, is presenting Torn Time, the first institutional solo exhibition of Bilgé (1934 – 2000) in the United States. Opened in the institute’s spaces in New York (May 6 – Aug. 31), the show, curated by Mohammed Rashid Al-Thani, unveils two decades of Bilgé’s work, tracing her unwavering relationship to nature through her diverse, deep and delicate approach to drawing.\nBorn in Istanbul, Turkey, Bilgé’s desire to become an artist landed her in New York in 1958, where she completed her master’s in painting at NYU. As a female immigrant, she navigated an artistic landscape that perceived her as ‘other’ - yet defied social expectation by remaining in the US.\nThe show explores Bilgé’s engagement with line and space, exploring scale, nature, fiction and geometry, connecting with experiences of alienation and exaltation. In 1972, Bilgé emerged from a deep-sea dive into The Tongue of the Ocean, a deep water region in the Bahamas, with a shifted perspective.\nInfluenced by her metaphysical encounters with nature, her work evolved from figurative painting to an exploration of the “spacelessness of space.” She began producing planar works, book-like objects which examined the materiality of paper.\nShe developed a disciplined, reductive vocabulary, packed with emotion, elements of which included tear, string, square and line. But inside the sparse language resides the potential for endless variation, and the characteristic transcendentalism of the artist’s work that departs from American minimalism. Slits and tears in the paper attempt to make visible the invisible, the layers and fibers of the material evoking the unpredictability of life itself.\nWhile her work examines the infinite potential of the line, the forces that drive it bring to the fore acts of expanding and shrinking, evidenced in her artist’s books, which must be unfolded and spread out to be experienced before being packed up again. Bilgé invites the vastness of the universe to share space within the boundaries of her work, without sacrificing the magnitude of its glory. By reorienting the understanding of space, she harnesses the possibilities of nature within her work. Through a skillful grasp of minimalism, Bilgé both ossifies and dissolves boundaries, exploring the intimate and ethical potentialities of abstraction.\nBilgé, also known as Bilgé Civelekoğlu Friedlaender, was a Turkish-American artist who extensively explored sensual, spiritual connections through her artistic engagement with geometric abstraction. In her long and prolific career, her artistic exploration developed through an expressive minimalist visual language. In her journals, she spoke of the universal human creations of the “line,” the “square,” and how they symbolise human relationship to nature. Bilgé’s career launched with solo exhibitions of minimalist works in 1974 at Betty Parsons and Kornblee Galleries in New York.\nHer transformative experiences of nature and early earthworks set the stage for her later ecological works in the 1980s, leading to interventions in nature, and working directly with natural materials. She was part of New American Paperworks and exhibited alongside Robert Rauschenberg and Michelle Stewart, among others. She continued to exhibit internationally through the 1990s, with works centering on awakening the human consciousness to our interdependence with nature, through exploration of ritual and the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh from a Feminist, Jungian position.\nExhibition venues included Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; the Second International Istanbul Biennial, Gallery Nev, Istanbul; American Craft Museum, NY; Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto; University of Massachusetts Museum at Amherst; Corcoran Museum, Washington D.C.; Arter, Istanbul and Neues Museum, Nürenberg. The Institute of Arab and Islamic Art (IAIA) is an independent, non-profit centre that promotes and advances the artistic and cultural dialogue between New York City and the Arab and Islamic worlds. It serves as a platform for creative, innovative and forward-thinking artists, curators, critics, scholars and intellectuals.\nThrough diverse education programmes, a multi-disciplinary exhibition space, knowledge-building facility, a residency programme and an emphasis on collaborations with global cultural organisations, IAIA provides a welcoming environment for the international community to learn about and engage with often over-simplified cultures. “The continued misconceptions of the Arab and Islamic worlds have limited and damaged cultural interactions and exchanges with the United States,” says IAIA. “The lack of facilities, resources and opportunities dedicated to Arab and Muslim artists in New York City has continued to alienate these individuals from a broader global conversation. IAIA establishes itself as a beacon to challenge social misconceptions and artistic stereotypes.”\nTo this end, IAIA fosters a dialogue between civilisations, while dissipating notions of borders by bringing to the fore a thorough appreciation of the Islamic region’s own Modern and Contemporary Art. Founded on the value of nurturing art, IAIA is dedicated to both the preservation and revival of Arab and Islamic art. IAIA presents works by artists from the Arab and Islamic worlds, including video art, traditional media, performances, archival exhibitions, installations and commissioned works. Curated, well-researched exhibitions are held on a quarterly basis with additional programming that includes a residency programme for artists, critics, curators and writers, to engage with New York’s art scene. “IAIA recognises the significance of creating knowledge and is therefore producing publications, screenings and lectures. IAIA shares resources, forges partnerships and collaborates with established institutions and foundations across the Arab and Islamic worlds as well as New York, bringing together ideas and creating opportunities,” the organisation says.",

    "title": "Winter storm to bring heavy snow to Midwest, New England this weekend",
    "text": "[Cybele Mayes-Osterman](/staff/8391111001/cybele-mayes-osterman/) A winter storm is expected to usher in a snowy start to spring, with snowfall already beginning in parts of the Midwest on Friday morning before the storm moves eastward to drop snow on upstate New York and New England later in the weekend. Forecasters expect the storm to blanket the Minneapolis area in up to 6 inches of snow on Friday morning, as it also brings snow to Chicago and Milwaukee, according to AccuWeather . Some areas in southern Wisconsin could see up to 12 inches. \"It looks like areas just to the north of Chicago, just to the north of Detroit are probably going to pick up anywhere from 6 to 10 inches out of this,\" said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather. Kines said the affected midwestern areas have likely already seen the worst part of the storm on Friday morning. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for Minneapolis and St. Paul on Thursday evening as the area also faced below freezing temperatures. The Twin Cities could be hit with a bout of heavy snow and strong winds that will move in on Sunday morning and continue to impact the area until Tuesday. Kines said some spots north of Minneapolis, as well as parts of northwestern Illinois could rack up as much as 10 inches of snow. The Service also warned commuters in several midwestern cities to beware of hazards caused by slush and ice-covered roads on their Friday morning commute. In Detroit, the NWS said visibility could fall to a mile or less. In Chicago, drivers were warned of slick travel spots caused by the slushy snow. To the west, the Northern Plains could face its own round of heavy snow beginning in eastern Montana on Saturday, with a high chance of at least 6 inches predicted from the border between the Dakotas stretching to Minnesota and Wisconsin on Sunday. The NWS in Great Falls, Montana, warned drivers to \"be prepared for difficult driving conditions\" beginning Saturday afternoon. Luckily, the chilly weather won't stick around in the Midwest for long, Kines said. \"For those folks, the weekend should be dry for the most part.\" Watch: [Residents flee Shenandoah County as wildfire tears through mountains, destroys homes](/videos/news/nation/2024/03/22/residents-flee-shenandoah-county-as-wildfire-tears-through-mountains/73065137007/) Heavy snow expected in New England through the weekend Over the weekend, chilly temperatures will descend on the central Appalachians as the Northeast, from New York to Maine, is blanketed in moderate to heavy snowfall from Friday night through the next evening. A winter storm watch will go into effect for some counties in upstate New York as the snow begins to pile on. The chilly conditions could cause ice to form on the state's thruways, especially near the Pennsylvania border, where snow will mix with rain. The snow could give winter sports enthusiasts another weekend of fun, as some New England ski resorts are expected to get an extra layer of powder. \"Places like Burlington and Montpellier, they'll do quite well,\" Kines said. \"I think both those areas could get at least 6 inches of snow.\" Light snow of around an inch could also impact northern Pennsylvania to the southern tip of New York at the beginning of the weekend. The northern parts of New York state, as well as Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, could be slammed with up to 12 inches of snow. Ahead of the expected storm, the NWS issued a flood watch in New York City, northeastern New Jersey, and some parts of the Lower Hudson Valley from late Friday night through the next evening. Those areas could receive up to 3 inches of rain, forecasters said. Kines said cities in the I-95 corridor – Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and the district – will be affected by the rain. \"Some of the rain is going to be heavy enough probably to cause at least flooding in poor drainage areas, if not along streams, in that neck of the woods,\" he said. The rain could be accompanied by wind gusts of up to 45 mph on New Jersey's coast on Saturday. The stormy weather could trigger high tides and coastal flooding on the Atlantic coast into Monday. Kines said the rain in those cities will give way to windy weather on Saturday and Sunday, but the bad weather would abate soon afterwards. \"The weather should improve pretty quickly, and Sunday looks like a nice day.\" Warmer temperatures in New England at the end of the weekend and later in the week will also melt the snow in the area before too long. \"The sun will be out,\" he said. \"It does look like those places are going to get milder early next week, [in the] forties, and maybe there's a day it's above 50.\" Cybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.
