    "title": "Why the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police is upset with Indianapolis Bar Association",
    "text": "( WIBC ) — A recent judgement in the shooting death of an Indianapolis officer has the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President concerned not only about the judicial system, but about the futures of police in the capital city.\nWhat started as a death penalty case ended with a sentence of time served for Elliahs Dorsey, which was a little less than four years for the reckless homicide of a police officer. Dorsey is accused of shooting and killing officer Breann Leath in 2020.\nDorsey was found guilty but mentally ill on six charges.\n“Court will sentence the defendant to a total sentence of 40 years on count two. The court will suspend 15 of those years for 25 years executed,” said Marion County Superior Court Judge Mark Stoner during the end of Dorsey’s sentencing hearing.\nIndianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder demanded that Stoner step down from the bench after the ruling. The Indianapolis Bar Association said Snyder’s response was an overreaction.\n“Some made remarks in the local media that dangerous offenders can shoot anyone and simply say they have a mental health problem, and they will receive a “sweetheart” sentence. This rhetoric is dangerous, and it is false. All six of the doctors serving as expert witnesses in this case agreed that Dorsey was experiencing an episode of psychosis when he fired shots in April 2020. The disagreement among the expert witness doctors was only as to what caused the episode. When Judge Stoner sentenced Dorsey specifically for the killing of Officer Leath, he was confined to the sentencing parameters of a Level 5 felony, namely: one to six years. Judge Stoner sentenced Dorsey to five and one-third years, nine months shy of the maximum sentence. Dorsey’s total sentence for the crimes he committed in April 2020 was 45 years and 118 days, 30 years of which is to be executed in prison followed by 15 years of probation where the Court will monitor Dorsey’s behavior and mental health condition. Should Dorsey not abide by the conditions of his mental health probation, he could be sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his 15-year term of probation,” said the Indianapolis Bar Association earlier this month.\nOn Thursday, Snyder said he’s doubling down on his criticism.\n“Shame on you Indianapolis Bar Association. You have emboldened this kind of crap. This is why officers in the City of Indianapolis are fleeing this community,” said Snyder.\nSnyder says Indianapolis is being torn apart by the very criminal justice system that is supposed to be protecting it.\n“They are choosing to go to other communities to be able to do that because there’s no hope here,” said Snyder.\nSnyder claims the sentencing sent a message that if you kill a cop, you can blame it on mental health for a lesser sentence. The FOP has put a billboard out in Indianapolis that says the city is down about 350 cops.\nBLAME GAME: Amazed to hear IndyBar Assoc is calling Public Criticism of Judge Mark Stoner and his Lenient Sentencing of Cop Killer “false and dangerous”\n🔴 Hear Indy FOP’s Message to IndyBar right after Judge’s disgraceful miscarriage of Justice👇 #Emboldening #Shameful pic.twitter.com/0h3czpoclW\n— Rick Snyder (@RickFOP86) April 25, 2024",

If yes, can you explain what that practically means? Do they really conduct military operations from schools and hospitals and residential buildings? If yes, why?\n- Does Hamas have a \"pay for slay\" program, in which they pay Hamas terrorists for killing (or taking hostage) innocent Israelis?\n- Can you explain what those who have been brought up in the west fail to understand about the mindset and culture of those in Hamas? Why do so many in the west support it, and do you think they actually know/understand what they're supporting?\n- Is Israel illegally occupying Gaza and The West Bank?\n- Is Israel truly an apartheid state?\n- Is Israel trying to commit a genocide against Palestinians?\n- Does Israel have the right to exist?\n- What is the resolution to all of this? Is a two-state solution possible (or even desirable)?\n- What can us regular people do to improve the world and lead us toward peace?\nYou can get your copy of Son of Hamas here ► ⁠https://amzn.to/47ZslNw",

    "text": "Meet the all-women c-suite team of Rapid City Medical Center Celebrating the rise of women in a corporate legacy RAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA) - Women are outnumbered by men five to one in the nation’s 100 top publicly traded companies, according to a USA Today analysis. Research says when you add women to the c-suite level, the workplace changes because female executives bring skills that are different than men. We talked with a group of women in power about changing the face of the corporate-suite right here in Rapid City. Meet four women on the front lines of the [Rapid City Medical Center’s](https://rapidcitymedicalcenter.com/) c-suite. Trained, educated and brave, this all-women, all-moms dream team is transforming healthcare. “I’ve never wanted to earn my position based on my gender, I’ve always wanted to be the best candidate and I truly believe the three ladies sitting at my left were the best candidates. We have a phenomenal team,” explained Jennifer Trucano, chief executive officer, Rapid City Medical Center. Trucano, a former lawyer, says healthcare is an industry that under-serves its customers with few women in leadership roles, “Women make up 80 percent of all healthcare decisions.” And still women represent 10 percent of the corporate suite positions across Fortune 500 and 25 percent of the leadership positions in healthcare. Trucano says, despite the numbers, Rapid City Medical Center’s legacy has always been more inclusive than exclusive. Established in 1948, Rapid City Medical Center is a physician-owned practice with more than 70 doctors who pride themselves on diversity in hiring. “We are really unique and the largest physician-owned group in all of the Great Plains region, including Minnesota and Nebraska. We are really proud that we been in existence to provide healthcare to people from five states for over 75 years and we have actually 60 percent of all of our physicians are women and in the healthcare arena that’s quite rare,” adds Trucano. And just how rare? In corporate healthcare, the stats drop even more for an all-women c-suite duo like RCMC. Heather Bindel, chief operating officer for Rapid City Medical Center and number two in command, says it’s more about respect for the person than gender, “I think it comes down to the amount of respect you have for the person in the role and their abilities and I don’t think of it differently if it were a male.” Complimenting the team, Chief Financial Officer Rebekah Wolkenhauer, who is in charge of the profit and loss, says she knew if hired it would be impactful, “I was very aware and appreciative of the move and the level of respect that comes from these ladies.” Completing the c-suite is newcomer Colleen Bsharah, human resources director. She says she appreciates the corporate sisterhood. “I was excited for who I would get to be working with, it’s not everyday that you get this opportunity to work with women in your field and learn from that and see what that is. You hear a lot about the differences between men and women but I think a lot of it comes down to a lot of women haven’t had these roles and show that they can make these hard decisions and show they can be that leader and come into it and be strong.” Women have long been apart of the legacy at the Rapid City Medical Center and now with the evolution of the c-suite, these four women are living examples of what women can do and accomplish when they work together.

    "text": "Real Estate Mogul Daniel Neiditch Teams up with Sports Legends John Starks, Darryl Strawberry and Tommy Devito for a Day of Charity in New York March 14, 2024 2:50 PM EDT | Source: [River 2 River Realty](/company/10302/River-2-River-Realty) New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - March 14, 2024) - In a remarkable display of camaraderie and compassion, real estate magnate and philanthropist Daniel Neiditch recently united with New York sports legends Darryl Strawberry (NY Yankees and NY Mets), John Starks (New York Knicks), and Tommy Devito (New York Giants) for a memorable event in Westchester, NY on March 10, 2024. The day was filled with spirited competition and heartfelt gestures, as Daniel Neiditch engaged in friendly matches with these iconic athletes to support the Promise Project, a charity dedicated to assisting underprivileged children with learning disabilities. Daniel Neiditch's charitable involvement in events like this is deeply rooted in his commitment to advocating for educational opportunities for children facing learning challenges. He believes that learning disabilities are not indicative of a child's intelligence but rather a neurological condition that can impede traditional learning processes. For Dan Neiditch, the lack of access to proper assessment and support, especially for low-income families, presents significant barriers to these children's educational and developmental success. The event brought together these sports luminaries, each renowned for their philanthropic efforts, for a common cause. John Starks, a Knicks legend, is well-known for his foundation, which provides financial aid to college-bound high school seniors. Darryl Strawberry, a baseball icon, focuses on improving the quality of life for individuals affected by autism. Strawberry had a heart attack the day after this event and he appears to be recovering in his hometown of St. Louis. Tommy Devito, nicknamed Tommy Cutlets, a rising star with the NY Giants, has quickly endeared himself to fans not only for his on-field prowess but also for his commitment to giving back to the community. The day began with a friendly basketball match between Neiditch and Starks, showcasing their competitive spirit and mutual respect. Despite Starks' basketball prowess, Neiditch held his own, demonstrating his passion for the cause. The game was followed by a baseball session with Strawberry, where Neiditch displayed his baseball skills and shared in the joy of the game with the legendary World Series Champion outfielder. The highlight of the day was a football game with Devito, who has quickly become a fan favorite with the NY Giants. Devito's passion for giving back to the community was evident as he played alongside Neiditch, showcasing his talent and generosity. The event served as a platform for these athletes to not only showcase their skills but also to raise awareness for the Promise Project Charity. Daniel Neiditch's involvement in the Promise Project is a testament to his commitment to making a difference in the lives of children facing learning challenges. Through his work with the charity, he hopes to raise awareness about the importance of early intervention and support for children with learning disabilities. He believes that every child deserves access to a quality education and the opportunity to reach their full potential. Starks, Strawberry, and Devito's participation in the event further highlights their dedication to giving back to the community. Despite their status as sports icons, they remain grounded and committed to making a positive impact in the lives of others. These athletes teaming up with Dan Neiditch and their involvement in this day demonstrates their belief in the power of sports to bring about meaningful change. Overall, the event was a resounding success, not only in terms of fundraising but also in raising awareness for the challenges faced by children with learning disabilities. It showcased the power of collaboration and compassion, reminding us all of the importance of giving back and supporting those in need.

    "title": "Torna libera per buona condotta \"mamma Isis\", pentita di avere aderito alla Jihad",
    "text": "Torna libera per buona condotta \"mamma Isis\", pentita di avere aderito alla Jihad\nEra stata arrestata in un campo profughi siriano e, fin da subito, si era detta felicissima di rientrare in Italia. Il marito era un combattente dell'Isis\nEra stata soprannominata 'mamma Isis': Alice Brignoli, condannata per terrorismo internazionale, si è definitivamente pentita e lascerà il carcere. Nel mese di febbraio del 2015 aveva lasciato l'Italia insieme al marito (italiano di origini marocchine) Mohamed Koraichi e ai suoi figli, che all'epoca avevano sei, quatto e due anni, per raggiungere i territori siriani occupati dal sedicente 'Stato islamico'. I carabinieri del Ros l'avevano rintracciata in Siria insieme ai figli e l'avevano arrestata, rimpatriando in Italia tutti (compreso il figlio più piccolo, nato in Siria). Si trovava (catturata dai curdi) nel campo di Al-Hawl, mentre il marito era morto per una infezione intestinale.\nResidenti a Bulciago, nel Lecchese, marito e moglie avevano in precedenza\nabbracciato la causa dell'Isis e si erano trasferiti nei territori siriani, dove lui aveva preso parte a operazioni militari, mentre lei educava i figli alla jihad: sono state ritrovate fotografie che li ritraggono in divisa mimetica, il maggiore anche con un fucile in mano. Al momento dell'arresto, Brignoli si era dichiarata \"non più radicalizzata\", pentita di quella scelta di vita e felicissima di rientrare in Italia. Tra l'altro il campo di Al-Hawl era considerato molto pericoloso per i pentiti, perché le forze curde non riuscivano a garantire appieno protezione contro le vendette degli irriducibili.\nNel 2021, quando aveva 43 anni, era iniziato il\nprocesso con il rito abbreviato, da lei scelto, alla fine del quale era stata condannata a 4 anni di reclusione (la procura ne aveva chiesti 5), con l'affidamento dei suoi figli a una comunità per minori. Ora la conclusione della vicenda. Dal 2 gennaio 2024 sarà libera con qualche mese di anticipo sulla fine della pena, per buona condotta. Secondo quanto si apprende, avrebbe smesso di indossare il velo e sarebbe tornata agli abiti occidentali, e sarebbe pienamente pentita, ormai, delle scelte del passato. Rivedrà i figli ma solo per un breve incontro, perché le è stata tolta la potestà, e loro rimarranno in comunità, almeno per il momento.",
