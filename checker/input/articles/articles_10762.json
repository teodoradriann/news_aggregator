    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nHosek wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.

    "title": "YES Prep volleyball coach accused of sexual acts with teen students could have more victims",
    "text": "HOUSTON – A former YES Prep volleyball coach has been arrested and charged after being accused of having multiple sexual interactions with at least two students. 23-year-old Osvaldo Flores is facing four felonies, including two counts of sexual assault of a child, sexual performance by a child, and improper relationship with a student. Recommended Videos His current bond is set at a total of $315,000. YES Prep has confirmed Flores worked at the Southwest Secondary campus as a seasonal employee from August to December 2022 and again in August 2023 until his employment ended in October 2023, when the allegations came to light. SEE ALSO: ‘This is traumatizing’: Houston Park Ranger accused of targeting, threatening men in exchange for money while on the job Houston Police told KPRC 2′s Bryce Newberry since Flores had access to so many children, investigators are looking into the possibility of additional victims and charges. The alleged victims who have come forward were 15 and 17 years old at the time of their interactions with Flores. After the 15-year-old girl posted a photo on Instagram, Flores allegedly texted her, “I know this is wrong, but you’re really pretty,” according to court records. He eventually picked her up from her house before taking her to a parking lot in October 2023, when he’s accused of sexually assaulting her. The girl’s parents realized she had left home in the middle of the night and tracked her phone to the parking lot, where they found her in the backseat of his car, according to records. The incident was reported to the school, which eventually led to a 17-year-old victim. She told investigators she would stay late to help clean up after games or practices and one day, she noticed that Flores was following behind her, closer and closer, records show. On at least two occasions, he’s accused of following her into a storage closet at the campus and “touching, fondling and groping” her around the beginning of the volleyball season. “[The student] stated that [Flores] would stand behind her with his chest touching her back, grab her by her waist, and pull her closer,” the charging document states, adding that she was able to feel Flores’ penis touching her from behind while her clothes were still on. While telling him to stop, the student told police Flores was laughing as he continued the touching. She said that Flores said to her, “No, no, no. You want this. You do like it. I know you like it.” On another occasion, he allegedly followed the teen to her car and forced her to perform oral sex, records show. Flores would reach out to her on social media and continue conversation with her in a group chat with the other teammates, sometimes asking for new song suggestions or sending her compliments like, “You looked cute today.” Flores has allegedly confessed to his role in some of the acts. He allegedly told police that he knew the student was a senior and assumed that all seniors were either 18 or 19. He added that after school, the two of them would “talk and stuff but it progressed more.” “It’s a horrific crime and it’s prevalent,” Lisa Burgoyne, director of partner relations at the Children’s Assessment Center said. “They don’t expect that to happen in a place of safety, like a school or a church or a community, you know, center where we trust that our children are being taken care of.” Data shared by the Children’s Assessment Center indicates 400,000 children are sexually abused in America each year. 90% of victims are abused by someone they know and trust 60% are acquaintances, like teachers or neighbors 30% are immediate or extended family 10% are strangers Only 31% of children tell someone within the first year “It’s important for parents to have good relationships with their kids to talk about—you know—age appropriate, conversations about sex, about boundaries, about one on ones,” Burgoyne said. “If you start young and you’re having those conversations, then hopefully your child comes to you or you recognize that shift [in behavior].” She said the behavior shift may look different in each case, but it could include a change in grades, depression, or anxiety. “The effects of trauma are devastating to kids. They have long term health consequences,” she said. YES Prep released the following statement: “In October 2023, YES Prep received a complaint about inappropriate behavior involving a coach and a student from our Southwest Secondary school. Per protocol, we immediately placed the coach on leave and subsequently ended his employment after conducting a thorough investigation. The school proactively communicated with the families of the students on the volleyball team. We also reported the case immediately to the Houston police as well as the Texas Education Agency (TEA) for further investigation. YES Prep expects all staff to uphold the highest standard of professionalism in all communication and interactions with students. We are committed to ensuring that all students are in a safe and secure environment, and we take quick and strict action when this commitment is compromised.” Houston Police are urging any other victims to come forward, and call HPD Special Victims or the Children’s Assessment Center (713) 986-3250.",
