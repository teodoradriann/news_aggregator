    "title": "How air pollution contributes to lung cancer in non-smokers - AirQualityNews",
    "text": "A new study has found strong genetic evidence that air pollution may contribute to the development of lung cancer in people who have never smoked or smoked only minimally.\nThe research, undertaken by the University of California San Diego and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, aimed to discover why, as global smoking rates have declined, there has been a rise in lung cancer cases among non-smokers.This form of cancer disproportionately affects women, particularly those of East Asian ancestry, and is more common in East Asian countries than in the West.\nPublished today in the journal Nature, the research involved analysing lung tumors from 871 non-smokers living in 28 different regions worldwide, in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.\nThe researchers used whole-genome sequencing to identify specific DNA mutations which act like fingerprints of environmental exposures such as air pollution.\nBy comparing these genetic patterns with long-term air pollution data, the researchers found that people living in more polluted environments had significantly more mutations in their lung tumors.\nMany of these mutations are known to promote the development of cancer and some resembled the type typically seen in smokers, despite the fact that those involved had little or no history of smoking. This included a nearly fourfold increase in a mutation commonly associated with tobacco exposure and a 76% increase in another linked to aging.\nThe researchers point out that their findings do not suggest that air pollution causes a completely new or unique type of DNA damage, rather that it increases the overall number of mutations in the DNA of lung cells. These mutations show up in known ‘mutational signatures’ – patterns of DNA damage that scientists have already associated with tobacco smoking, aging or other causes.\nMaria Teresa Landi, epidemiologist in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the NCI and co-senior author of the study, said: ‘This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand regarding never-smokers.\n‘Most previous lung cancer studies have not separated data of smokers from non-smokers, which has limited insights into potential causes in those patients. We have designed a study to collect data from never-smokers around the world and use genomics to trace back what exposures might be causing these cancers.’\nThe team made two additional findings of interest.\nFirstly, they found that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke did not lead to the same DNA mutation patterns as caused by exposure to air pollution.\nHowever, as co-first author Marcos Díaz-Gay, pointed out: ‘It’s difficult to get that kind of information because it depends on various factors such as amount of time one was exposed; how far one was from exposure; and how often one shared a space with someone else who smoked, for example.”\nSecondly, they also found a link between lung cancer and aristolochic acid, a known carcinogen which can be found in traditional Chinese herbal medicines. This mutational signature was found almost exclusively in lung tumors from non-smokers in Taiwan.\nWhile being a known carcinogen, aristolochic acid has not previously been implicated in lung cancer. Researchers suspect that inhalation of herbal remedies may be responsible.\nThe team also unearthed a new puzzle by indentifying a new mutational signature that appears in the lung cancers of most non-smokers but not in smokers. Its cause remains unknown\nStudy co-senior author Ludmil Alexandrov, professor of bioengineering and cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego explains: ‘We see it in a majority of cases in this study, but we don’t yet know what’s driving it. This is something entirely different, and it opens up a whole new area of investigation.’\nThe full report can be read here.\nPhoto: National Cancer Institute",

È inaccettabile che, dopo mesi di trattative interrotte, Federmeccanica e Assistal continuino a ignorare legittime richieste sindacali\". Lo afferma sui social la segretaria generale della Cisl , Daniela Fumarola. \"Il contratto collettivo - sottolinea - è fondamentale per adeguare i salari al costo della vita, migliorare le condizioni di lavoro, generare e redistribuire crescita garantendo maggiore sicurezza, soprattutto negli appalti. Rifiutarsi di rinnovare significa mortificare la dignità, il valore e il ruolo di chi, ogni giorno, contribuisce alla crescita del Paese in settori strategici. Chiediamo con forza la riapertura immediata del tavolo negoziale. Serve responsabilità. Serve rispetto. È ora di dare risposte concrete ai metalmeccanici\".\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",

    "text": "A Câmara Municipal do Rio de Janeiro aprovou, nesta quarta-feira (2), em segunda discussão, o Projeto de Lei nº 2970/2024, que institui o Programa Sobre o Uso Responsável da Inteligência Artificial no setor público municipal. A proposta, de autoria do vereador Vitor Hugo (MDB), busca modernizar a administração pública por meio da adoção de tecnologias baseadas em inteligência artificial (IA), com foco em eficiência, transparência e redução de custos.\n“O que buscamos é estabelecer um marco regulatório que oriente o uso da inteligência artificial pelos órgãos públicos do município, promovendo inovação de maneira ética, transparente e alinhada aos princípios democráticos”, destacou o vereador Vitor Hugo.\nEntre as diretrizes do programa estão o incentivo a investimentos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento, a revisão de estruturas políticas e legislativas para a incorporação de novas tecnologias, o estímulo à interoperabilidade entre sistemas e o fomento à capacitação profissional, preparando servidores e cidadãos para as mudanças no mercado de trabalho.\nO projeto também visa à desburocratização e à simplificação de processos administrativos, reforçando a importância da IA para o crescimento econômico sustentável e inclusivo.\nCom a aprovação, o texto segue agora para sanção ou veto do Poder Executivo, que ficará responsável por regulamentar e aplicar a nova lei.",

    "text": "THC and CBD improve motivation and enjoyment in the gym, study claimsResearchers found that cannabis is not a performance-inducing drugREAD MORE: Support for legalizing weed climbed to 70 percent last year\nAbout 80 percent of cannabis users have mixed weed and working out – and a new study has revealed there could be a method to what some may call madness.\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder conducted ‘a first-of-a-kind study’ that found smoking weed before hitting the gym increases motivation and enjoyment.\nParticipants hopped on treadmills for 30 minutes after using the drug and found not only did the time appear to pass by, but the workout felt harder than when they ran sober.\nThe team suspected the ‘runner’s high’ stemmed from the drug tapping into naturally produced brain chemicals that made individuals feel euphoric and alert.\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder conducted ‘a first-of-a-kind study’ that found smoking weed before hitting the gym increases motivation and enjoyment\nThe ‘runner’s high’ is likely caused by chemicals in the brain called endogenous cannabinoids, which kick in after longer workouts.\n‘The reality is, some people will never experience the runner’s high,’ first author and research fellow at CU Change Laurel Gibson said.\nThe study included 42 participants who already run while using cannabis.\nIndividuals were divided into two groups: One used a designated flower strain mainly containing cannabidiol (CBD), and the other a Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant strain.\nTHC and CBD are active ingredients in cannabis, with THC known to be more intoxicating.\nThe first portion of the study had participants run on a treadmill at a moderate pace for 30 minutes.\nThe study included 42 participants who already run while using cannabis. Researchers asked each person why they mixed weed with working out\nThey were asked questions periodically to assess how motivated they felt, how much they enjoyed themselves, how hard the workout felt, how quickly time seemed to pass and their pain levels.\nThen, each person redid the experiment while under the influence of cannabis.\n‘ Across the board, participants reported greater enjoyment and more intense euphoria, or ‘runner’s high,’ when exercising after using cannabis,’ the team shared in a press release.\n‘Surprisingly, this heightened mood was even greater in the CBD group than in the THC group, suggesting athletes may be able to get some of the benefits to mood without the impairment that can come with THC.\nParticipants run on a treadmill at a moderate pace for 30 minutes after smoking weed\n‘The bottom-line finding is that cannabis before exercise seems to increase positive mood and enjoyment during exercise, whether you use THC or CBD,’ Gibson said.\n‘But THC products specifically may make exercise feel more effortful.’\nThe University of Colorado conducted a previous survey that found how many people smoke weed before going to the gym.\nThe 2021 study revealed that while running at the same speed and intensity as the CBD group, the THC participants reported that it was much more difficult than running sober.\nThe results showed that ‘it’s pretty clear … cannabis is not a performance-enhancing drug,’ Angela Bryan, a senior author in the study and a professor of psychology and neuroscience and co-director of CU Change, said.\nThere is still the need for additional studies to determine if cannabis could help people who overall struggle to exercise because they dislike the activity or aren’t motivated.\n‘We have an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle in this country, and we need new tools to try to get people to move their bodies in ways that are enjoyable,’ said Bryan.\n‘If cannabis is one of those tools, we need to explore it, keeping in mind both the harms and the benefits.’",
