    "text": "La vía canaria para un turismo sostenible recibe el respaldo de la UE Publicada 04/10/24 - Las islas europeas integradas en la Conferencia de Regiones piden “un plan global” para avanzar hacia el turismo sostenible - Canarias ha presentado una declaración que aboga por medidas para trasladar los beneficios del turismo a toda la sociedad - Fernando Clavijo aboga por corregir los efectos colaterales que la presión turística está generando en los territorios insulares ‘Una visión del turismo sostenible en las islas’ es el título de la declaración impulsada por el [Gobierno de Canarias](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/gobierno-de-canarias) en defensa del sector, que ha sido aprobada este jueves por la Comisión de Islas de la Conferencia de Regiones Periféricas y Marítimas (CRPM) de la [Unión Europea](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/union-europea). El documento aboga por medidas para trasladar los beneficios del turismo a toda la sociedad. La denominada “vía canaria” se ha aprobado por unanimidad y sin enmiendas en la reunión de la Conferencia de Regiones que se celebra en Gozo (Malta). Ahora el texto será elevado a la Comisión y al Parlamento europeo con el objetivo de que sus propuestas se incluyan como prioridad en la hoja de ruta de la nueva legislatura. Entre esas prioridades, el documento solicita a la UE que ponga en marcha “un plan de desarrollo turístico sostenible adecuado” que incluya “los fondos necesarios para alcanzar estos objetivos”. El presidente de Canarias, [Fernando Clavijo](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/fernando-clavijo), que fue el encargado de defender la declaración en el plenario de la Comisión de Islas, destacó la necesidad de poner en marcha medidas para lograr atajar dos retos que comparten la mayoría de los territorios insulares europeos: el demográfico por el fuerte aumento de la población y el de “democratizar” el turismo para que sus beneficios lleguen a toda la población. Informó del proceso abierto en su archipiélago en busca de un modelo de desarrollo sostenible. Detalló que cinco mesas de trabajo con presencia de todas las instituciones de [Canarias](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/canarias) debaten desde hace meses qué medidas implementar para mejorar la calidad de vida de “toda la sociedad”, proceso de consenso que dará resultados en las próximas semanas. Además, se refirió al sector turístico como motor de la economía canaria y generador de empleo y riqueza. Al tiempo que abogó por corregir los efectos colaterales que la presión turística está generando en los territorios insulares, como el problema de acceso a la vivienda, la saturación de los servicios, la sobrepoblación de algunas islas y zonas, y los efectos en los espacios naturales del archipiélago. Las islas europeas integradas en la CRPM reclaman “un plan global” para avanzar hacia el [turismo sostenible](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/turismo-sostenible), “con enfoque integrado a través de un pacto europeo para las islas, que aborde las múltiples cuestiones que nos afectan desde una perspectiva insular”. Incluye asuntos como: - La ordenación del territorio - La gestión de los recursos - Los problemas de vivienda - Las políticas de transporte - La protección del medio ambiente - La producción de energía Más datos sobre este destino - [Canarias regulará por primera vez los campings y acampadas]- [Canarias tramitará con carácter urgente la normativa de vivienda turística]- [Protestas en Canarias: exigen una moratoria hotelera y vacacional \"total\"]",

There is a 63% decline in such activities,” DGP Swain stated during a press conference. He further said that as many as 55 foreign terrorists have been gunned down by security forces so far this year.\n“In 48 anti-terrorist operations, we have neutralised 76 terrorists, including 55 foreigners. The trend of foreign terrorists getting killed more starting in 2022 and continued this year, making it clear that our actual fight is against infiltrators,” he said, adding that anti-terrorism operations will be carried out with even more vigour in 2024.\nDGP Swain also informed that J&K has witnessed a steep decline of 80% in youth joining the ranks of terror outfits in J&K from last year. “There is an 80 per cent decline in terror recruitment this year. Year-on-year comparison shows that 130 locals joined terrorism in 2022 and this year, till date the number is 22. We will try to stop the recruitment completely which is essential to end the cycle of violence,” the J&K top cop was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.\nHe added, “When there is recruitment, action happens and the fallout follows, continuing the cycle. I am seeing the decline in recruitment as saving 113 people from getting killed this year.”\n(With inputs from agencies)",

    "text": "Le chef du Hamas Ismaïl Haniyeh a informé le Qatar et l’Egypte que le mouvement avait accepté une proposition de trêve à Gaza. Reuters / Majid Asgaripour Les discussions auraient-elles fini par porter leurs fruits ? Le Hamas a affirmé lundi avoir approuvé une proposition de cessez-le-feu à Gaza, présentée par l’Égypte et le Qatar, un accord « examiné » par Israël qui a déclaré envoyer une délégation auprès des médiateurs. Reste que Tel Aviv a déjà prévenu que la proposition acceptée par le Hamas « est loin des exigences israéliennes ». « IsmaÃƒÂ¯l Haniyeh, chef du bureau politique du Hamas, sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est entretenu par tÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©phone avec le Premier ministre qatari Cheikh Mohammed bin Abdelrahmane Al Thani et le ministre ÃƒÂ©gyptien des Renseignements, Abbas Kamel, et les a informÃƒÂ©s que le Hamas avait approuvÃƒÂ© leur proposition dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢accord de cessez-le-feu Ã‚Â», selon un communiquÃƒÂ© publiÃƒÂ© sur le site du mouvement palestinien. Ã‚Â« La balle est dÃƒÂ©sormais dans le camp Ã‚Â» dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢IsraÃƒÂ«l, qui a le choix Ã‚Â« entre accepter lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢accord de cessez-le-feu, soit y faire obstacle Ã‚Â», a ensuite dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AFP un responsable du Hamas sous le couvert de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anonymat. Les détails de cette proposition n’ont pas été dévoilés, et Israël n’a pas officiellement commenté dans l’immédiat. Un responsable israélien a toutefois déclaré à Reuters que l’accord accepté lundi par le Hamas était une version « adoucie » d’une proposition égyptienne, dont le contenu ne pouvait être accepté par Tel Aviv. « Cela semble être une ruse destinée à faire passer Israël pour la partie qui s’oppose à un accord », a déclaré ce responsable israélien, qui s’est exprimé sous couvert d’anonymat. Les États-Unis vont discuter de la proposition acceptée par le Hamas avec leurs alliés, a pour sa part indiqué le porte-parole du Département d’État américain, Matthew Miller. Un cessez-le-feu est « absolument réalisable », a-t-il également estimé lors d’une conférence de presse. Opération à Rafah Cette annonce intervient alors que l’armée israélienne a lancé lundi une opération visant à faire évacuer des dizaines de milliers de familles de Rafah, où s’entassent 1,2 million de Palestiniens, déplacés pour la plupart, selon l’ONU. Des scènes de liesse et des tirs en l’air se sont déroulées lundi dans les rues de cette ville, dans le sud de la bande de Gaza, après l’annonce du Hamas. En dépit des condamnations internationales, le Premier ministre israélien Benyamin Netanyahou persiste dans sa volonté de lancer cette offensive, indispensable selon lui pour détruire les derniers bataillons du mouvement islamiste dans le territoire palestinien. L’évacuation de la ville est un prélude à une opération « terrestre », a aussi affirmé lundi soir l’armée israélienne. Ce lundi soir d’ailleurs, de violents bombardements israéliens ont frappé l’est de Rafah, tandis que, dans le même temps, la branche armée du Djihad islamique palestinien a affirmé avoir tiré des roquettes depuis Gaza sur le sud d’Israël. Cela faisait plusieurs semaines que le mouvement islamiste palestinien et Tel-Aviv discutaient d’un nouvel accord, après une première trêve qui avait permis la libération de 110 otages en novembre. Les tractations s’étaient accélérées ces derniers jours, sous l’égide des principaux médiateurs, notamment l’Égypte, le Qatar et les États-Unis. Un cycle de négociations indirectes avait toutefois pris fin dimanche au Caire, sans avancée. Le Hamas réclamait que l’accord de trêve prévoie la fin de l’offensive israélienne dans la bande de Gaza, ce que refuse Israël qui se dit déterminé à anéantir le Hamas. « Nous continuons de croire quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un accord de libÃƒÂ©ration dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢otages constitue le meilleur moyen de prÃƒÂ©server les vies des otages et dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©viter une invasion de Rafah, oÃƒÂ&sup1; plus dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un million de personnes ont trouvÃƒÂ© refuge Ã‚Â», avait dit ce lundi le Premier ministre Benyamin Netanyahou. Du côté des familles, on espère aussi qu’il s’agit des dernières heures d’une attente interminable : « Le moment est venu pour toutes les parties concernées de respecter leur engagement et de transformer cette opportunité en un accord pour le retour de tous les otages », ont-elles déclaré via le Forum des familles d’otages.",

    "text": "Since President William Ruto announced that he would form a broad-based government, part of the opposition has warmed up to his administration. Then time came for the President to name his Cabinet and there was a split in the opposition, with some supporting the idea of having its members included while others said they were not interested. The matter was even the subject of discussion in Parliament, with some members of ODM saying Article 232 of the Constitution should be evoked in all appointments. The article is about the values and principles of public service which include high standards of professional ethics, efficient, effective and economic use of resources; responsive, prompt, effective, impartial and equitable, involvement of the people in the process of policymaking and transparency and provision to the public of timely, accurate information. The President took the next step and named his second batch of Cabinet Secretaries including four top ODM leaders, a move that saw some of his harshest critics join his administration. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma has emerged as one of the ODM legislators who support Ruto’s move. “History is made as John Mbadi becomes the first Luo to be appointed Minister of State in charge of the Treasury! Congratulations my brother. May God go ahead of you as you serve our motherland,” said Kaluma after the Cabinet Secretaries were sworn in yesterday. On Wednesday in Parliament, Kaluma said the President not only ensured ethnic and regional balance but also included minorities. Besides the National Treasury, ODM also got the Energy and Cooperative development dockets, the latter of which is in charge of Hustler Fund, Ruto's pet project. The docket went to former Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. The Energy ministry went to ODM stalwart Opiyo Wandayi. Former Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who has been one of the two ODM deputy leaders, is the new Mining CS. “Before the nomination of the last batch of nominees, I spoke passionately about the need for appointing authority to always comply with provisions of Article 232. When I spoke so, I did not know who the President had under consideration. I was speaking because when you come from Homa Bay across Migori to Nyamira and Kisii we had only one CS in Ezekiel Machogu, former Education CS and one Principal Secretary, Raymond Omollo for whom we had thanked the President,” Kaluma said. Even before ODM warmed up to Ruto, Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda openly supported the government, which put him at loggerheads with party leaders. Ojienda is now calling on Kenyans to give the President a chance to deliver. “A message to Kenyans let us give the government an opportunity to deal with those issues that led to a near collapse of government, to deliver on the promises of economic growth, inclusivity an give broad based government chance to deliver to the people,” Ojienda said yesterday. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter He said that when the President disbanded the Cabinet, he did so to form a government of national unity and now all the regions of the country are represented. “The President had to struggle with several issues, of course there was the Gen Z question that we grapple with to date. Apart from the Gen Z issue, there was the question of representation of other political formations in Government. As he ensured that Kenyans are part of Government, he gave an olive branch to Azimio and has brought in four new faces,” Ojienda said in an interview. ODM leaders in Nairobi, led by Makadara MP George Aladwa joined the calls for youth to call off anti-government protests. They said that the President had demonstrated goodwill and is ready to change. “If the country is destroyed, we will all lose. Even those in leadership positions will not have anywhere to run to. Gen Zs, you have been heard and the leadership will continue to listen to you,” Aladwa said. Aladwa also lauded ODM leader Raila Odinga for agreeing to work with Ruto, even as he dismissed claims that the ODM Cabinet members went against the party by joining the government. “We cannot solve the challenges facing the country when we take to the streets on a daily basis. Many people have lost their livelihoods and lives, which as a country should not be allowed to continue,” the leaders added. Yesterday, a Kisumu businessman said residents were no longer interested in protests that have been happening in the country because \"they are now part of the government\". According to the businessman, they will not be part of demonstrations because ‘they are now in Government’ by virtue of the now former ODM MPs being part of the Cabinet and thanked President Ruto and Raila for making this to happen. “Business is running as usual. We do not want to be involved in demonstrations anymore because we are now in government. We thank the President because he gave us four Cabinet slots. We do not want violence, we want peace in the country,” said the businessman.",
