    "text": "Sconfitta indolore in Inghilterra nel ritorno degli ottavi di finale\nUna fase di Brighton-Roma Missione compiuta per la Roma che approda ai quarti di finale di Europa League nonostante la sconfitta con il Brighton. I giallorossi, forti del 4-0 conquistato all'Olimpico, perdono 1-0 al Falmer Stadium ma passano comunque il turno e sono tra le migliori otto squadre della seconda competizione europea per club. A decidere il match del Falmer Stadium in favore dei ragazzi di De Zerbi è un gol di Welbeck al 37' del primo tempo.\nLa partita Partita di grande intensità sin dai primi minuti con i padroni di casa all'arrembaggio nel tentativo di compiere l'improbabile 'remuntada' e gli ospiti in difficoltà e costretti sulla difensiva. Al 23' in una delle rare proiezioni offensive i capitolini vanno in gol con Azmoun ma l'arbitro annulla per gioco pericoloso dell'attaccante iraniano. Al 37' la squadra di De Zerbi vede premiata la propria supremazia. Estupinan sfonda a sinistra e serve Welbeck il quale sposta la palla sul destro e la piazza all'incrocio dei pali.\nGli inglesi partono forte anche nella ripresa e al 5' sono pericolosi con Enciso che va al tiro da fuori area: palla a lato. Al 12' cross di Estupinan, Adingra colpisce di testa ma non inquadra la porta. Al quarto d'ora Roma finalmente pericolosa con una percussione di Spinazzola che calcia da posizione angolata, palla che colpisce la parte esterna del palo e termina sul fondo. Al 20' strepitoso intervento di Svilar che ha i riflessi prontissimi sul colpo di testa a botta sicura di Adingra . Poco dopo la mezz'ora ennesima conclusione del Brighton con Igor da fuori, respinta di Svilar sui piedi di Adingra che non riesce a concludere con efficacia.\nAl 35' e al 36' altre occasioni per gli inglesi. Prima Ansu Fati manda a lato una conclusione al volo, poi Adingra tira troppo centralmente a Svilar para. Al 45' Buonanotte entra in area elude anche l'intervento di Svilar con un passaggio ma nessun compagno arriva in tempo per spingere il pallone in rete. Nel recupero ancora Svilar protagonista: il portiere serbo vola a deviare un gran tiro di Ansu Fati.",

    "title": "UK deal-making at lowest level since the financial crisis as higher rates and global tensions dent confidence",
    "text": "Dealmaking involving UK companies has fallen to its lowest level since 2009 as higher interest rates and rising geopolitical tensions dent bankers’ confidence. Figures from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) revealed that the value of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in 2023 totalled just £208billion, 33 per cent less than last year. It is less than half the level of 2021 – a big year for deals as the world emerged from global lockdowns when the value of UK M&A totalled £516billion. The latest fall comes as wider global dealmaking also suffers a downturn, falling in value by 17 per cent to £2.3trillion. However, the City’s slump was worse than the 6 per cent decline seen in the US and the 28 per cent fall in dealmaking in Europe. Slowdown: Figures from the London Stock Exchange revealed the value of merger and acquisition activity in 2023 totalled just £208bn, 33% less than 2022 That will do nothing to relieve the gloom surrounding London’s status as a hub for global companies – with many deserting the UK despite reforms designed to halt the exodus. Lucille Jones, of LSEG Deals Intelligence, blamed the decline on rising interest rates and a gloomy economic outlook, as well as stricter enforcement by regulators of competition rules. Jones also said geopolitical tensions – such as the conflict in the Middle East – are adding to global uncertainty. But she added: ‘The year ended more strongly than it began, and with inflation coming down and rates normalising, it could give chief executives and boards a little more confidence.’ The figures showed that more than 5,500 deals involving UK companies were announced this year, down 19 per cent on 2022. But ‘outbound’ M&A – where a British firm is involved in buying an overseas company – was up year-on-year by 12 per cent, to £81billion. Globally, the top five deals were all-American transactions – the biggest being oil giant Exxon Mobil’s £51billion takeover of shale firm Pioneer.",

    "text": "Former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski revealed why, out of all of the teams he's played against, he hates the Indianapolis Colts the most.\nBy Scott Rogust | 11:20 AM EST\nJan 18, 2015; Foxborough, MA, USA; New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (87) celebrates / David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\nSports fans tend to have a team to root for, whether it was because they grew up cheering for them alongside their parents or because their favorite player was donning their uniform. As is the case, there is always a team that a fan despises, whether it be that they are a division rival or if they were responsible for a crushing defeat in the playoffs.\nThe same can be said for professional sports stars. There is always one team that a player just does not like and uses that energy to really play motivated in their future matchups.\nDuring his latest appearance on FanDuel TV's Up and Adams with host Kay Adams , former NFL tight end Rob Gronkowski revealed his utter disdain for one team in particular during his playing career -- the Indianapolis Colts .\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Fitzy (@fitzygfy)\n\"The Colts, let me tell you, I don't like the Colts,\" said Gronkowski. \"I was just on Julian's [Edelman] podcast Games with Names, actually, and we just absolutely dismantled the Colts, we've ripped them apart. They were hanging banners for winning a division. They were always a little cocky, always talked garbage when they played us. We just romped them week in and week out every time we played them, especially in the playoffs.\n\"I don't like the Colts. I always loved running up the score versus them. We dominated them in the pass game and in the run game as well. We were dominating them so bad they came up with the deflategate BS because they needed an excuse why we were absolutely terrorizing them.\"\nRob Gronkowski reveals why he will always hate the Colts As you can tell, Gronkowski really doesn't like the Colts. That makes sense, considering the Patriots and Colts went through many important battles in this century, notably highlighted by the quarterback duels between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.\nBut there was one instance that Gronkowski brings up that occurred after Manning departed from Indianapolis, and that's deflategate. In the 2014 AFC Championship Game, the Patriots defeated the Colts in a 45-7 blowout to advance to Super Bowl 49. But in that game, the Patriots were alleged to have used under-inflated footballs. The NFL launched an investigation that ultimately resulted in Brady being suspended for four games in the 2016 season (after an appeal) and the Patriots being fined $1 million and forced to surrender their 2016 first-round pick and their 2017 fourth-round pick.\nThe Patriots and Colts faced off midway through the 2015 season, with New England picking up the 34-27 victory. Gronkowski would play one more game against the Colts as a member of the Patriots in 2018 in a 38-24 win.\nIn his career, Gronkowski is a perfect 7-0 in seven games against the Colts. In those appearances, Gronkowski caught 33-of-40 targets for 545 yards and six touchdowns .\nThe stats don't lie. Gronkowski thrived against the Colts throughout his career. His disdain for the AFC South team may have played a role in it, as he expressed how much joy he took in helping the Patriots or Tampa Bay Buccaneers run up the score against them in his career.\nNext.

Durante años, se rehusó a abandonar la tumba de su dueño, a pesar de los esfuerzos de los residentes locales que intentaron adoptarlo.\nEl animal se convirtió en un símbolo de fidelidad y amor, inspirado en la conmovedora historia de Hachiko, el perro japonés que también aguardó fielmente a su dueño durante nueve años después de su muerte.\nA principios de este año, en febrero, el gato fue trasladado a San Petersburgo por un grupo de voluntarios. El felino llegó en condiciones delicadas debido a las enfermedades que había adquirido durante su vida al aire libre.\nCon la atención médica y el cariño de sus nuevos cuidadores, ‘Hachiko’ pasó los últimos dos meses de su vida disfrutando del calor y la comodidad de un hogar, como cualquier otro gato doméstico.\nUn final de ‘Hachiko’ que refleja su lealtad\nEn Rusia, a una gata se le murió el dueño en el 2018\n— ElBuni (@therealbuni)\npasaron 7 años y todavía lo sigue esperando arriba de la tumba\nYa esta toda enferma x vivir en la calle pero cuando la adoptar se escapa\nComo no saben el nombre le pusieron hachiko[pic.twitter.com/vOgBTEG8oY][February 7, 2025]\nA pesar de su sufrimiento y los años que pasó sin que nadie lo cuidara adecuadamente, el felino nunca olvidó a su dueño.\nEn sus últimos momentos, la decisión fue clara: su cuerpo descansará junto al ser querido que nunca dejó de esperar. Así, el gato será enterrado junto a la tumba de su amo, en el lugar que lo vio ser fiel hasta el final.

    "text": "- Details - By Jonathan Sharp Native Vote 2024. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure, with military personnel being among the groups at highest risk due to service-related exposure. In the U.S., there are over [16.2 million veterans](https://www.statista.com/topics/1279/veterans/#:~:text=A%20military%20veteran%20is%20a,the%20United%20States%20in%202022.), of whom [183.000](https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/understanding-america-the-legacy-of-native-american-military-service#:~:text=Service%20continued%20at%20a%20high,American%20Indian%20or%20Alaska%20Native.) are Native Americans. Although mesothelioma is one of the rarest forms of cancer, veterans account for around 30% of all diagnosed cases. Native American veterans, in particular, also seem to [experience poorer health outcomes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8236669/) and face greater exposure to hazardous conditions. Across all ethnic groups, once a mesothelioma diagnosis is made, survival rates at 5 years post-diagnosis range between [7% to 24% with treatment](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/malignant-mesothelioma/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-statistics.html). However, without treatment, the [survival expectancy](https://www.mesothelioma.com/mesothelioma/prognosis/life-expectancy/#:~:text=The%20average%20mesothelioma%20life%20expectancy%20without%20treatment%20is%20about%20six,for%20patients%20receiving%20treatment%2C%20too.) is about six months. This significant difference in survival rates makes early diagnosis crucial to receiving adequate medical care. What makes pleural mesothelioma hard to diagnose? Pleural mesothelioma has an insidious onset with symptoms that can mimic conditions like the common cold, and the flu, or overlap with symptoms of pulmonary and cardiac disease, for which some may already be receiving treatment. This symptomatology, combined with the rarity of the condition makes doctors less likely to consider it. At the same time, mesothelioma can emerge [20 to 60 years post-exposure](https://www.asbestos.com/mesothelioma/latency-period/), further hindering patent history taking simply because people may not even consider a link between past exposure and their symptoms. Clinical practice is also plagued by [some limitations in diagnosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8198453/). As mesothelioma is so rare, not much attention is given to considering the gold standards for diagnosis and clinicians are not adequately trained to recognized differentiating symptoms. Moreover, current diagnosis standards apply to usual presentations, while disregarding earlier stages of the condition and atypical manifestations. Current research on mesothelioma [diagnosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8192079/) indicates that around 14% of cases are still misdiagnosed in developed nations, and more research is needed to fully understand pathological mechanisms that may help refine diagnosis methods. A National Mesothelioma Registry to Improve Diagnosis At present, there is a pressing need for significantly more research to be carried out on mesothelioma, not only in diagnosis methods but also in terms of new therapeutic pathways. Yet access to participants that may facilitate this research process is significantly limited for scientists. New cases diagnosed [take up to two years](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/04/08/2019-06784/mesothelioma-registry-feasibility-request-for-information) to reach national statistics, where researchers can identify and contact patients for taking part in new studies. As survival rates are very low, by the time a case is reported through national statistics, and thus becomes available to researchers, the patient is no longer alive. A National Mesothelioma Registry would in effect eliminate this problem, as patient information would become instantly available to healthcare research professionals under a case-finding methodology system. This would enable researchers to build more accurate pathology models for disease prediction and progression, which in return may result in refined diagnosis methods and better treatment options. Better Diagnosis for Native Americans In the [Native American population](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.32746), several types of cancers are more prevalent when compared to other populations. While a genetic predisposition has been considered, this has been [mostly dismissed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574207000294). Nevertheless, the illegal disposal of asbestos onto tribal lands, also known as [fly-tipping](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/why-are-cancer-rates-higher-among-native-american-communities#:~:text=Mesothelioma%20is%20a%20common%20cancer,play%20a%20role%20in%20this.), is a massive contributor to increased mesothelioma occurrence in this population. In this context, mesothelioma in Native Americans seems to be highly dependent on the social determinants of health, rather than genetics. Yet building a complete picture of these risk factors is necessary for informing patient history taking and diagnosis procedures. If data from a National Mesothelioma Registry becomes available, social risk factors and exposure can be analyzed in more depth in this population. These data can then inform healthcare interventions in local communities, such as patient awareness campaigns, support regular clinical testing for exposed populations, as well as develop educational campaigns and seminars for healthcare staff to recognize at-risk groups. Without timely access to patient data, none of these approaches are possible, which makes the creation of a National Mesothelioma Registry crucial for improving diagnosis, healthcare and treatment.
