    "text": "Samsung QN90D 98-inch QLED TV Score Details “The QN90D series is excellent, but the 98-inch model fell apart for us.” Pros Excellent color accuracy Deep blacks, impressive contrast Solid on-board sound Sparkling HDR brightness Cons Intermittent processing anomalies Too expensive Table of Contents Table of Contents Samsung 98-inch QN90D specs Solid and robust Speedy response, but needs a soundbar Numbers for Nit Nerds Day-to-day watching A word on what “premium” means these days When you look at TV ads from 1998, a 56-inch Panasonic rear-projection TV — in 4:3 format, no less — cost $5,500. Adjusted for inflation, that is about $10,500 today. We’ve come a long way. You can now get a 98-inch TV for that kind of money, or even way less. TCL is selling its 98-inch Q6 — with free installation if you buy from Costco — for $1,600. That’s about $8,000 less than the 98-inch Samsung QN90D.\nRelated Samsung’s new 65-inch The Terrace TV will transform your backyard Of course, the QN90D is a much better TV than the TCL Q6. TCL offers 8-series TVs with similar picture quality to the QN90D for $4,000, which is still a lot of money, but much less than the $10,000 or so you can find the Samsung for right now.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends So it’s fair to say: The 98-inch Samsung QN90D , with its hefty price tag, has a lot to prove. What does it do well and what does it do not-so-well? And what does it do that should not happen at all? Let’s find out.\nSamsung 98-inch QN90D specs Size 98 inches Display Type mini-LED Backlight Type Thousands of LED backlights Operating System Tizen OS Screen Resolution 4K Ultra HD (3,840 x 2,160) HDR Support HDR10+ Adaptive, HDR10+ Gaming, HDR10, HLG Refresh Rate 120Hz, Samsung Gaming Hub, VRR, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro Audio Support Dolby Atmos, Dynamic Theater Surround Connectivity 4 HDMI (HDMI 2.1), 2 USB, Ethernet, Optical Audio Output Networking Built-in Ethernet (LAN) Tuner Built-in Tuner Solid and robust The TV is built well. It’s heavy, but it’s solid. Any 98-inch TV is likely going to be heavy and feel solid, but this one feels extra robust for a 98-incher.\nIt comes with a pedestal stand, which is impressive. The TV’s considerable heft makes it a good candidate to be mounted on a wall — where I think it looks its best — and well-suited for a dedicated entertainment space as it may be too big for a common area. Samsung could have just outfitted the TV with a couple of feet, but they included an attractive pedestal stand that’s built like a tank, and I appreciate that.\nThere is some flex to the TV when mounted on the stand, which is unavoidable on a TV this size, shy of having a 300-pound metal chassis. Even so, this TV isn’t going to topple unless there’s a major earthquake or you’re doing parkour in your living room with reckless abandon.\nIt’s surprising not to see an array of bass transducers — or little mini subwoofers — lining the back of the TV. That’s classic high-end Samsung these days. The 8Ks have it. Samsung’s OLEDs get it. Why not here? If there’s a reason, it eludes me.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends Samsung’s latest remote is very small, rechargeable via solar and USB-C, and shy on buttons. Navigation happens via Samsung’s Tizen interface, which is due for a facelift soon, as Samsung is going to put a version of its One UI, ported over from its mobile devices, over its current Tizen operating system. It will still be Tizen — and Bixby will still be around — but you’ll have Alexa as an option, too.\nSpeedy response, but needs a soundbar Zeke Jones / Digital Trends Navigation and app-loading times are quick. There is no waiting around for this TV to catch up to clicks, and content always loads and plays quickly. However, during the first few hours of using this TV, Samsung TV+ was forced down my throat, and I didn’t care much for it. Samsung TV+ is a bunch of free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels. It’s great to have all that free content available, but I do not want it to start playing automatically. Eventually, though, I set it up so just the home screen loaded, ready for my impatient commands.\nSamsung deserves praise for offering a smart calibration feature, but …\nThe audio system on this TV is better than the competition at this size, but as good as it is, it won’t blow you away. A picture this big needs better sound. And Samsung makes some stellar soundbars. I paired the QN90D TV with the Q990D soundbar and turned on Samsung’s Q-Symphony sound, and I thoroughly enjoyed the sound and picture combination. The whole package was insanely cinematic.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends One more thing: Samsung deserves praise for offering a smart calibration feature. You can use the SmartThings app to calibrate your TV, and when it works, it works really well. Unfortunately, the latest version of the SmartThings app does not work on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 16, and iPhone 15. Also, you can only use Samsung phones — no other Android phones — to calibrate the TV. Sure, Samsung needs to make sure the camera is adequate, but not allowing any other Android devices? Come on.\nNumbers for Nit Nerds For the numbers geeks, here’s what the measurements say.\nI used a Calibrate HL Plus colorimeter, Video Forge Pro pattern generator, and Calman Ultimate calibration software to run it through a suite of tests. I also changed up the window size several times to try to thwart any cheating on behalf of the TV.\nIn SDR Filmmaker mode, the 98-inch QN90D came in at 120 nits, which is textbook for this picture mode. Juicing up the brightness resulted in a 700-nit reading.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends The two-point white balance and grayscale in SDR Filmmaker looked quite good until it reached the brightest whites. At that point the red channel falls off a bit, which is weird for a picture mode with a warm color temperature setting. That said, the error was just barely in the perceivable territory with a max Delta E around 4. I have seen much, much worse from most of the 98-inch TVs I have tested, so respect to Samsung.\nThe color accuracy in SDR and HDR is phenomenally good — I got top-tier OLED numbers on the color accuracy. The TV didn’t cover quite as much of the BT.2020 color space as I’d hoped, but the colors produced in Filmmaker Mode were exceptionally good. Again, respect to Samsung’s engineers.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends I tested Movie mode, too, and it had similar results with color accuracy and grayscale. The real difference between Filmmaker Mode and Movie mode is that Filmmaker followed the EOTF curve perfectly, and Movie mode was intentionally and significantly over-brightened, which, while not accurate, is what most folks seem to like.\nPeak brightness numbers were not as intense as I was expecting: about 1,700 nits with everything maxed out (in Filmmaker and Movie modes). Generally the other modes won’t actually be brighter, they’ll just look brighter due to the cooler color temperature.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends A 1,700-nit peak is respectable, but the TCL and Hisense TVs are in 3,000-nit territory. I never felt like this TV wasn’t bright enough in HDR, but in SDR I was surprised that I had to max out the brightness to be really happy with the picture.\nIn the end, the QN90D offers some stunning HDR images — and SDR, too. I just wouldn’t call it the best bright-room TV you can buy. TCL and Hisense win gold and silver in that race because they get more intense in SDR.\nWhen it comes to measurements, the QN90D is a solid TV — definitely a flagship.\nDay-to-day watching I put a lot of hours in on this TV: some 18 episodes of Mythbusters , five episodes of Suits , four episodes of Bosch: Legacy , three episodes of CHiPs , eight hours of YouTuber Golf, as well as watching Interstellar two and a half times — once on YouTube and once on 4K Blu-ray, and about half of it on each platform again. This is in addition to all the usual content I use to evaluate TVs.\nI just wasn’t blown away.\nFor the overwhelming majority of the time, I enjoyed watching the QN90D very much. It does a lot of things really well.\nBut I was not blown away. And if I spend $10K on a TV? I want to be blown away. To be fair, I’ve seen all of the TVs, and I am jaded. Most folks will be blown away by this TV. I just expected more because many of Samsung’s TVs regularly blow me away.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends With the QN90D, though, something just isn’t sitting right with me. This TV, on rare occasions, would make me go … wait … what?\nLike, the backlight system: 99% of the time it’s awesome. When it is playing content, it’s just awesome. There’s very little halo or blooming, which is better than the TCL QM8 and Hisense U8N, I think — neck-and-neck at the very least. And the backlight is speedier, too. Transitions between bright and dim happen very fast.\nBut sometimes, like when pulling up info screens on YouTube or Prime Video, the APL goes way up. Why?\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends There’s also some weirdness (that can be seen on the wall by the stairs in the clip above), which I think is a processing issue — it doesn’t behave like a backlight issue. I see it most often with moving people against certain color backgrounds like green and dark yellow amber. It’s worse on low-quality content, which may be fundamentally tied to upscaling and exacerbated by pixel-level adjustments to enhance contrast.\nTo be fair, in Interstellar — a three-hour movie — it happened for less than 15 seconds. I watched this TV for four days and didn’t see it once. The percentage of time this is visible was negligible for me, but this shouldn’t happen on a TV this advanced and this expensive.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends Most of the time the motion resolution is outstanding. And then sometimes — especially on YouTube, and even with relatively high-quality content — it’s a stutter fest.\nDid I get a dud? I don’t think so. Perhaps the processor is not happy driving this size of panel. I’ll work with Samsung on this: They’ve been gracious about taking feedback and working to make their products better.\nA word on what “premium” means these days The TV sales ad from 1998 reminds us that the price of a top-tier, large-screen premium TV today is in line with that it was 26 years ago. What’s changed is the competitive landscape. Hisense and TCL have TVs with competitive picture performance selling for unbelievably low prices — so low, I sometimes wonder if they’re making much margin.\nThe fundamental question here is: What is Samsung offering that those guys aren’t? Let’s revisit those and then you can place your own sense of value on which premium aspects are important to you.\nStarting with build quality, the QN90D does feel like a better-built TV than large screens from TCL and Hisense. The pedestal stand itself — and its inclusion — is premium. You just don’t seem them with competition at this size. Then there are build quality things going on inside the TV that aren’t obvious from the outside. There are choices about how the TV is wired up and where the power supply goes, which can make the TV easier to repair, if necessary, and also makes the TV thinner.\nZeke Jones / Digital Trends Samsung in the past has also told me that part of its design philosophy is to beef up components around common failure points — little electrical connections or the quality of the power supply, for example. The kind of things that tend to fail on less-expensive TVs will hopefully not fail on a Samsung.\nAnother example of premium is the remote, which is rechargeable in two different way — something you don’t see from comptetitors. Samsung is also proud of its Knox security features built into its TVs. I can’t speak to how effective they are or how that compares to the competition, but security has been a focal point.\nThe sound quality, even though I encourage you to get a soundbar, is significantly better than competing TVs. Then there’s Samsung’s support of smart devices, which goes way beyond just Chromecast, HomeKit, and AirPlay. Additionally there’s Multi View, which allows you to put content side-by-side on the screen, the implementation of cloud gaming options through Samsung’s Gaming Hub, object tracking sound, and Q-Symphony.\nThis isn’t an exhaustive list, as Tizen hides all kinds of stuff within it, but that’s a pretty long list of premium features. So the question is: How much of that is stuff that you want, and are you willing to pay a lot more for it?\nFor now, here’s my takeaway. This TV looks excellent 99% of the time. It’s a classy TV. It will blow many folks away.\nBut the price of admission is too steep. I rarely let price get in the way of a recommendation when I’m talking about a premium product, because this is the kind of TV that mostly wealthy folks and business owners will purchase. In this case, though, I can’t let it slide. I think the TV is too expensive. It pains me to say it. And if it is going to cost this much, it needs to blow me away like Samsung’s other excellent TVs do.\nEditors’ Recommendations Samsung just dropped a massive 98-inch Neo QLED mini-LED TV",

    "title": "Xbox Partner Preview Showcase Unveils Eclectic Lineup of Games",
    "text": "During the Xbox Partner Preview event held on October 17, 2024, several highly anticipated games and expansions were revealed, giving gamers a glimpse of what to expect in the near future. From horror to sci-fi to quirky indie titles, here’s a breakdown of the most notable announcements. Wake 2: The Lake House DLC Fans of the psychological horror series Alan Wake were treated to a preview of the upcoming DLC, The Lake House. This expansion promises to dial up the horror, offering a more intense and dark experience just in time for its October 2024 release. Perfectly aligned with the Halloween season, this content is poised to give players a chilling new chapter in Alan Wake’s saga. Chronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team, the developers behind the Silent Hill 2 remake, introduced their new sci-fi horror project, Chronos: The New Dawn. The trailer teased an unsettling story featuring a bloodied monster hunter and a grandmother playing chess, suggesting a deeply eerie narrative. Slated for a 2025 release on PC and Xbox, Chronos looks to be a unique blend of psychological and cosmic horror. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Taking the Yakuza series in a bold new direction, Like a Dragon transports players to Hawaii with a surprising pirate theme. This mix of magical realism and pirate adventure offers a vibrant and bonkers (which is very on-brand) twist to the franchise. Subnautica 2 The deep-sea survival horror game Subnautica is getting a sequel, and its reveal left fans eager for more. While the showcase only featured a cinematic trailer, Subnautica 2 promises to expand on the original’s tense underwater exploration. Set for early access in 2025 and available on Game Pass, the game will once again immerse players in the alien depths of a terrifying ocean world. Phasmophobia The hit ghost-hunting game Phasmophobia will be making its way to Xbox, launching on October 29, 2024. This highly popular co-op horror game has been a PC favorite and is expected to gain a new audience with its console release, just in time for Halloween. Mouse: P.I. For Hire A standout indie title from the showcase, Mouse: P.I. For Hire combines classic noir detective storytelling with fast-paced shooter mechanics. The game’s unique art style, reminiscent of 2D Disney cartoons, offers a nostalgic yet fresh take on the genre. It’s set to release in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S and PC. FBC: Firebreak One of the biggest surprises of the event was the announcement of FBC: Firebreak, a multiplayer co-op shooter set in the Control and Alan Wake universe. Developed by Remedy Entertainment, this game marks the studio’s first foray into multiplayer gameplay. Set in Control’s iconic Oldest House, players will team up to battle the Hiss, introducing a new dynamic to Remedy’s shared universe. It’s scheduled for a 2025 release on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

    "title": "#58 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",

All the products are made by the same company.\nStory continues “The cheeses are sometimes sold as a full block or served as individual portions and may have been provided as part of a hamper you’ve purchased or been gifted,” the FSA said.\n“In some cases it’s been sold as part of a charcuterie grazing platter. It may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”\nAntonia’s family have launched an online fundraising page to support her.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "More than 700 council workers could go on strike over ‘fire and rehire’ proposals lodged by Aberdeen City Council.\nUnite the Union notified Aberdeen City Council on Friday of a members ballot on industrial action amid a row over contract changes.\nThe council has proposed a pay freeze after cutting the working week from 37 to 35 hours a week and would essentially impose new contracts on staff.\nIf enacted, the plans would cut workers’ wages by up to 104 hours per year, impacting over 3,000 workers across administrative, waste, library, janitorial, craft, social work, and housing roles at Aberdeen City Council.\nUnite have warned that widespread industrial action would lead to a significant reduction in provision for some of the city’s most vital services.\n“Aberdeen council’s incendiary fire and rehire plans are disgraceful and must immediately be taken off the table,” Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said.\n“It is a callous attempt to demolish pay and conditions for some of the lowest paid workers in Aberdeen. Unite will resist this with every single tool at our disposal including extensive industrial action if necessary.”\nUnite has also accused the Scottish Government of “ignoring” the escalating dispute between Aberdeen Council and its employees.\nUnion bosses are claiming the council’s proposals are a breach of the Fair Work First agreement which the Scottish Government requires councils sign in order to receive millions in grants funding.\nThey said any threats to impose new contracts on workers would also be “severely restricted” in the upcoming Employment Rights Bill at Westminster.\n“The fire and rehire plans by Aberdeen council need to be ditched or strike action will lead to services grinding to a halt. If that happens, the blame will lie exclusively with councillors and council officials,” Vic Fraser, Unite industrial officer, said.\n“The use of fire and rehire breaches the fair work principles. The Scottish Government must intervene and clearly tell Aberdeen council to withdraw the proposal or face sanctions.”\nMr Fraser said the failure by government ministers to act is “evidence that they are simply trying to ignore this issue”.\nHowever, a spokesperson for Aberdeen City Council said: “Dismissal and re-engagement has not been suggested by the Council during any consultation, engagement or discussions that have been taking place.”\nThey said that fire and rehire is “one possible lawful route” to implement contractual changes, the council said it would not consider it without exhausting all other possible routes.\n“Constructive discussions are continuing with Trade Unions, through ongoing formal consultation meetings, where our desired outcome is to reach agreement,” the spokesperson said.\n“The goal is to reach an agreement through this consultation process with employees and trade unions, whose feedback has already improved and amended the original proposal.”\nA spokesperson for the Scottish Government said it has been “consistently clear that it opposes fire and rehire practices”.\n“We encourage continued consultation and meaningful dialogue between Aberdeen City Council, workers and their trade unions on this matter to reach a resolution,” the spokesperson said.\nThe Unite the Union ballot opens on Friday March 28 and closes on April 14.\nGMB Scotland members are also voting on potential industrial action to halt the threat of “fire and rehire”.\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp\nScan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",
