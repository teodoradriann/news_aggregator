    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "The\nTennessee Titans became a part of two endings on Sunday in Week 18.\nThe first one involved ending the Jacksonville Jaguars’ pursuit of the AFC South title and playoff berth, knocking off their AFC South rivals 28-20. But the second ending they became a part of? The Derrick Henry era.\nDerrick Henry Delivers Emotional Postgame Speech at Nissan Stadium\nSunday’s win likely marked the final game for star running back Derrick Henry in a Titans uniform.\nHenry, the powerful locomotive who won two league rushing titles and surpassed 2,000 yards back in 2020, is an unrestricted free agent for the 2024 offseason. And he looked like his old self against his longtime rivals by racking up 153 yards and a touchdown.\nThe 30-year-old gave the Titans fan base one last dominating rushing output for the 2023 season. But then he took the microphone to give his fans one more lasting memory — a goodbye.\n“Titan fans, I want to say thank you for the greatest eight years of my life,” Henry began. “The ups and the downs, y’all have been there through everything from the adversity and watching me grind as a person and a player. You always supported me. I love y’all. I love seeing the 22s in the stadium.”\nHenry hoped he left a lasting impact on Nashville, particularly the youth.\n“I hope I was an inspiration to all the young kids and everybody in the community. I respect y’all so much,” Henry said.\nHe ended his speech with two words: “Titans up.” Then, he jogged off the field and was showered with “Henry!” chants as he took what is likely his final trip through the Nissan Stadium tunnel.\n\"\n[@Titans]fans… Thank you for the greatest 8 years of my life.\" 👑💙 [@KingHenry_2] [pic.twitter.com/3CpEHq4PiC]\n— NFL (@NFL)\n[January 7, 2024]\nDeAndre Hopkins Offers Reaction to Henry’s Speech and Titans Career\nAgain, it’s likely the veteran running back and the Titans are trekking toward a mutual separation.\nFor De’Andre Hopkins, he won’t get the chance to share the same Titans locker room with “King Henry” in 2024. The longtime rival of Tennessee from his Houston Texans days joined Henry and the Titans immediately before the season as a free agent.\nStill, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver told reporters he was honored to be impacted by the presence of Henry.\n“Derrick is going to get that standing ovation no matter what kind of game he had. To me, it’s a dream come true to play with a guy who’s going to be in the NFL Hall of Fame and plays the way he plays,” Hopkins told reporters in the locker room. “Especially for 8-9 years. I don’t think he’s going to stop anytime soon.”\nHopkins added he knew Henry before they became NFL teammates as they’ve worked out before. He added Henry didn’t think he’d come over to the Titans.\nStill, the two men paired together. For Hopkins, the presence of Henry fulfills one of his hopes for his own career.\nMORE:\n2024 NFL Free Agents by Position\n“I always hoped to play with a great running back,” Hopkins said. “Especially this late in my career. I can handle the load, but it definitely helps to have a running back to make things easier on the outside.”\nDeAndre Hopkins on Derrick Henry. Says it was a dream come true playing with a future HOF running back.\n[#Titans] [pic.twitter.com/Rco6HSnKPn]\n— AtoZ Sports Nashville (@AtoZSports)\n[January 7, 2024]\nHopkins ended up being a part of Henry’s final run as a Titan. And for Henry, he gave closure to a dominating run from 2016 to now.\nWant to predict the rest of the 2023 season with our FREE\nNFL Playoff Predictor? Looking for the most up-to-date NFL standings?

Bashar Taleb / AFP via Getty Images On Wednesday, Israeli forces sent a shipping container to Gaza that contained bodies of 88 Palestinians that were decomposed to the point that they were unidentifiable, sparking horror over Israel’s treatment of Palestinians even after death.\nIsrael delivered the Palestinians’ bodies in a large yellow container loaded on a truck, with no identification or information about how, when or where the people were killed.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry rejected the shipment, saying in a statement that officials told Israeli authorities that they would not carry on with procedures to collect the bodies until Israel returned with the names and times of death of the Palestinians, as well as the locations they were abducted from. Palestinian officials decried the shipment as an “inhumane and criminal move.”\nNot only did the Israeli military not provide any information about the Palestinians, it also seemingly allowed the bodies to rot before trying to return them to Gaza. According to Al Jazeera reporter Tareq Abu Azzoum, “the bodies are unidentifiable because they are mostly decomposed.”\nGaza health officials have set up a committee with “all relevant parties” to handle the bodies.\nRelated Story News | Human Rights UNRWA: Israel Denying Visas to Aid Groups, “Phasing Out” Humanitarians in Gaza UNRWA’s head has warned that Israel is seeking to strip Palestinians of their refugee status by attacking the agency. By Sharon Zhang , T ruthout September 17, 2024 Truthout Israel has abducted thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank over the past year. Many of these people were imprisoned in Israel’s torture camps, where they were subject to horrific conditions like beatings, food and water deprivation , and sexual assault . The number of Palestinians the Israeli military has killed in these camps is unclear, but the UN reported in July that it knows of at least 53 deaths in Israeli custody since October. A UN expert reported this week that a third Palestinian doctor has died in an Israeli torture camp.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) noted that it was not involved in the transfer of the bodies, but said that “all families have the right to receive news about their loved ones and bury them respectfully and in line with their traditions.” The group also noted that it is a violation of international law to mishandle dead bodies.\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor called for an immediate international investigation into the shipment, saying that Israel has likely violated international humanitarian law in its desecration of the Palestinians’ bodies.\n“The ‘container’ holding the dead bodies was left in one of Khan Yunis’s streets. This is a grave violation of the rights of the dead people and their families, as well as a catastrophic situation that could result in a health catastrophe,” the group said.\nIsrael has delivered the bodies of Palestinian people in this way multiple times amid its genocide. This past August, Israeli forces delivered the unidentified bodies of over 80 Palestinians in a container.\nPalestinian officials noted that it was unclear whether the bodies were people who had been abducted by Israeli forces or if the bodies had been exhumed from their graves by the Israeli military . Officials said that Israeli forces have stolen 2,000 dead bodies from Palestinian cemeteries since October.\nIsrael has a long history of maiming Palestinians’ bodies after death. Last week, video circulated of Israeli forces pushing dead bodies off a rooftop amid a raid in the occupied West Bank.",

    "text": "When schoolchildren were asked to name a construction crane on the site of a new Mater hospital, little Leticia Salas had the perfect answer – Doctor Crane. The six-year-old's suggestion has now been chosen as the crane's official name after judges decided Leticia's was the best entry from around 300 students who took part in Mater's 'Name the Crane' competition. Dr Crane is supporting John Holland Queensland workers in the construction of Mater Private Hospital Springfield Stage 2 – a major expansion of Mater's existing hospital that will provide an extra 174 public beds for the community. Leticia, a student at Springfield's Good Shepherd Catholic Primary School, said she had a very good reason for choosing the name. \"The reason why I named it Dr Crane is because doctors help people – and the crane is helping build the hospital that will help people,\" she said. Mater Private Hospital Springfield Acting General Manager Billy Jovanovic said children at five Springfield primary schools had entered the 'Name the Crane' competition, as well as a colouring competition. \"Leticia's suggested name for our new crane really stood out and definitely made the judges smile,\" Ms Jovanovic said. \"I don't think there could be a better name for a hospital crane than Doctor Crane!\" A second crane at the new hospital has been named Galu – an Indigenous name for a crane bird – following a separate competition open to nearby Aveo residents and Mater staff. The winning suggestion was made by hospital staff members Shiny John and Nadia Wilson. Mater Hospital Springfield is being built through a partnership between the State Government and Mater and will deliver Springfield's first public emergency department, intensive care unit and comprehensive maternity and birthing services. The new hospital will employ more than 1000 people when it becomes operational in 2026.

    "text": "Los trabajadores de la extinta Notimex concluyeron el viernes la huelga que mantenían desde febrero de 2020 luego de que el Gobierno cumpliera con el pago de indemnizaciones a los trabajadores del Sindicato Único de Trabajadores de la agencia de noticias del Estado.\nEn un comunicado, la Secretaría de Trabajo y Previsión Social (STPS) informó que ayer hizo el pago de las indemnizaciones “en cumplimiento al Convenio de Terminación de las Relaciones Colectivas de Trabajo acordado entre el Gobierno de México y la organización gremial”.\nSeñaló que en cumplimiento a las instrucciones del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador se realizó el pago correspondiente “con pleno respeto a los derechos laborales de la organización sindical, de acuerdo con la Ley Federal del Trabajo”.\nEsto, abundó, deriva de la mesa de trabajo que se sostuvo estos días en las instalaciones de la Junta Federal con representantes de las secretarías de Gobernación, del Trabajo, del INDEP, de Notimex y el Sutnotimex (Sindicato Único de Trabajadores de Notimex), donde se aprobó y suscribió la versión final del convenio.\n“Llegó el momento menos esperado para quienes trabajamos en la agencia de noticias del Estado mexicano que es el cierre definitivo”, señaló en un breve mensaje a medios la secretaria general del Sutnotimex, Adriana Urrea.\n‘Cierre de Notimex por mala gestión’\nAclaró que no fueron los trabajadores quienes decidieron cerrar Notimex, sino que fue la “mala gestión” la que decidió no mantener este medio de comunicación pues se argumentó que podría sustituirse con uno nuevo y que existía corrupción y falta de profesionalismo en los trabajadores.\n“Hoy se baja el telón, se baja la cortina, se apagan las computadoras y se tapan los lentes de las cámaras de Notimex, ya no se escuchará más en los medios, en las salas de prensa, en las noticias información de Notimex”, dijo entre lágrimas Urrea.\nIndicó que con ello se cierra un capítulo en la historia del periodismo de México y el mundo y se termina con la fuente laboral de más de un centenar de trabajadores “que lucharon, que dieron su vida por su fuente de empleo y que hoy fueron liquidados luego de 1,408 días de huelga”.\nEn octubre, el Gobierno a través de las secretarías de Gobernación y del Trabajo, firmaron un acuerdo con el Sutnotimex en el que acordaron la decisión de desaparecer Notimex, agencia creada con motivo de los Juegos Olímpicos en México en 1968.\nLee:\nCámara de Diputados aprueba desaparición de Notimex\nInicio del conflicto en Notimex\nEl conflicto laboral en la agencia de noticias comenzó en febrero de 2020 por el posible despido injustificado de al menos 200 colaboradores, principalmente mujeres, lo cual fue reprochado y defendido por el SutNotimex, sindicato que fue sustituido por la empresa a la llegada de su nueva directora, Sanjuana Martínez.\nEn distintas ocasiones, el presidente López Obrador defendió el cierre de Notimex tras más de tres años del conflicto laboral que se inició durante su Gobierno.\n“Se está buscando un acuerdo porque nosotros no necesitamos una agencia de noticias en el Gobierno, eso era de la época de los boletines y de la prensa oficial y oficiosa, ya no hay eso”, manifestó varias veces desde el inicio del conflicto.\nCon información de EFE\nSíguenos en Google Noticias para mantenerte siempre informado",

Por: Johan Sebastián Gómez Rojas Publicado: 19 de septiembre de 2024, 2:25 PM Actualizado: 19 de septiembre de 2024, 2:25 PM Ciclistas en Bogotá. Foto: Colprensa Cada vez más habitantes de Bogotá optan por medios de transporte alternativos debido a las complicaciones en la movilidad, siendo la bicicleta una de las opciones más destacadas por su rapidez y conveniencia para moverse por la ciudad. Por esta razón, durante la Semana de la Bici, los ciclistas tendrán la oportunidad de participar en diversas actividades y recibir premios. A partir del próximo lunes 23 de septiembre, los ciclistas de Bogotá tendrán la oportunidad de recibir elementos de protección como parte de la programación de la XVII Semana de la Bici.

Durante estas jornadas, se distribuirán cascos, luces reflectivas y candados, elementos fundamentales para la protección de los ciclistas en la vía. Claudia Díaz, secretaria de Movilidad de Bogotá, destacó la importancia de estas actividades: “Estamos comprometidos con la seguridad de los ciclistas y la promoción de la bicicleta como un medio de transporte seguro y eficiente. La entrega de estos elementos de protección es una muestra más de nuestro compromiso con la seguridad vial.” Además de la entrega de elementos de protección, la Semana de la Bici contará con una serie de eventos que incluyen el foro académico ‘Mi casa es cultura bici’ y ciclopaseos a diversas zonas de la ciudad. Estos eventos buscan no solo educar a los ciclistas sobre la seguridad vial, sino también celebrar y fortalecer la cultura de la bicicleta en Bogotá.

Desde la Secretaria de Movilidad indican que, \"el próximo martes, 24 de septiembre, llevaremos a cabo una jornada pedagógica de sensibilización, cuyo foco es el bienestar ciclista. Este día, en la Av. Guayacanes con calle 51 Sur y en la carrera 30 con calle 80, tendremos nuestra campaña Vidas Reflectivas donde el mensaje principal es hacernos ver en la vía. Allí entregamos a los y los ciclistas elementos para hacerse visibles como chalecos, cintas reflectivas y luces. Asimismo, tendremos una entrega de candados ese mismo día en la cicloalameda El Porvenir, donde entregaremos y rifaremos estos elementos para parquear la bici de forma segura entre personas vulnerables\". La Semana de la Bici se celebra anualmente como parte del Acuerdo Distrital 668 de 2017, en un esfuerzo conjunto entre la Administración Distrital, la academia y diversos colectivos de la bicicleta.
