    "title": "Sunnyside Vision Plan to Transform Commercial Corridor",
    "text": "BIDs in Brownsville, Brooklyn; Sunnyside, Queens; and the Bronx Capitol District published Vision Plans for the future of their public spaces, after 12 months of community engagement and collaboration with designers. The Vision Plans from Pitkin Avenue BID, Sunnyside Shines BID, and 161st Street BID lay out a blueprint for how to reimagine public spaces in their commercial corridors through installations, programming, and capital improvements. The BIDs received funding, technical assistance, and consultation with city agencies through the Local Center, a partnership between Urban Design Forum and the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development (“ANHD”).\nThe BIDs worked with teams of designers to construct creative improvements to their public spaces to drive foot traffic and strengthen neighborhood connectivity and safety. They engaged 100+ residents, small businesses, and community stakeholders in each neighborhood to understand local priorities for public space. The teams tested those ideas in Summer and Fall 2024 through short-term activations like lighting installations, night markets, and shading structures in plazas and parks. These and other ideas are captured in the BIDs’ Vision Plans.\nThe plans include short- and long-term strategies for transforming the districts’ public spaces to reflect the identities and priorities of local businesses, artists, and residents. Each BID will work with community stakeholders and city agencies to advocate for additional investment and support to advance these strategies in 2025 and beyond.\nBy directing more investment into comprehensive vision planning and lively public spaces in under-invested commercial corridors, this initiative helps further the New York Governor and New York City Mayor’s “New” New York Action Plan to reinvigorate New York City’s business districts and amplify cultural and economic vibrancy in public spaces across the boroughs.\nSunnyside Shines Business Improvement District, serving Sunnyside, Queens, worked with di Domenico + Partners and the Queens Lighting Collective to produce the Sunnyside Vision Plan focused on transforming underutilized areas, including the plazas and parking bays underneath the 7 train and Sabba Park, into vibrant spaces that reflect the neighborhood’s diverse communities, encourage community interaction, and stimulate local businesses. In 2025, the BID will advance vision plan ideas for night markets and performance space in Lowery Plaza and a new lighting installation on Greenpoint Avenue.\n“This was a wonderful opportunity to reconceptualize the use of our public spaces in Sunnyside and have structured conversations on how to improve the spaces and maximize their use by the community,” said Dirk McCall de Palomá, Executive Director of Sunnyside Shines BID. “We are incredibly grateful to the Urban Design Forum, ANHD, and all of their funders, especially the NYC Department of Small Business Services (SBS) for teaming us up with a design firm and a lighting firm to embark upon this process together. It was incredibly helpful and will result in improvements to our public spaces and have deepened our connections to our local community.”",

    "text": "It’s the Recommended exit for Cilento . The best solution, for the Anas managers . The one to get there first Agropoli and, running south, reach Palinuro e Cameroon . This is the exit recommended by Anas, despite the two deaths on July 18th. Mario Valiante and Wilma Fezza husband and wife, both lawyers, were headed to Roccadaspide. They followed the advice of Anas. And they ended up in a long and exasperating queue on the motorway. Overheated by the heat of July, 40 degrees in the cockpit . Twenty, thirty minutes of waiting in the car. Before finally “going out” in Eboli.\nMario and Wilma’s journey ended under the green road sign with the words “ EBOLI ”. A young truck driver from Nocera Inferiore hit them and killed them instantly. Mario and Wilma followed the advice of Anas. They ended up in the funnel . They were the last in line. A distracted truck driver didn’t see the queue and ran over everyone: cars and vans stopped in line .\nDal Last July 18th nothing has changed. Anas continues to recommend the Eboli exit, to arrive earlier and more relaxed in Cilento. Every morning, at the junction of death, two lines of cars now form. Traffic increased in August . It was predictable. There are those who are smart. They skip the queue. And they can’t get back into the lane. And so the tail is doubled . Many have asked the mayor of Eboli to place a patrol of traffic police at the crossroads between the junction and San Vito Martire Street . In two months, the white helmets have been “seen” only once. The cap is still there. At the junction that has never been redeveloped due to the presence of illegal structures. Bars, dairies and gastronomic businesses are doing a roaring trade. Politicians are renewing their promises. Now the new junction will be ready for 2027. Word of Mario Conte mayor of Eboli. Who will build the new exit? Uhm, uhm, politicians don’t answer. The tender hasn’t been done yet. Nor have the expropriations.\n#Eboli #dead #junction #changed\n– 2024-08-15 20:55:48",
