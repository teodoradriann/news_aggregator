Enquanto isso, o Irã acusou Israel de tentar \"expandir\" a guerra na região.\nOs esforços diplomáticos continuam para evitar uma escalada militar, após o Irã prometer retaliação pelo assassinato do líder político do Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, em 31 de julho em Teerã, em um ataque que atribui a Israel.\nOs ataques em Gaza ocorreram após o assassinato de Haniyeh e do líder militar do Hezbollah no Líbano, Fuad Shukr, morto em 30 de julho em um bombardeio israelense perto de Beirute.\n\"O risco geopolítico no Oriente Médio está sempre presente\", avaliaram analistas da firma DNB.\nNos Estados Unidos, o número de pedidos de seguro-desemprego divulgado nesta quinta-feira foi menor do que o esperado na semana passada, dissipando temores de uma recessão no país e aumentando as esperanças de que a demanda por energia se mantenha elevada, beneficiando os preços do petróleo.\nOs pedidos de seguro-desemprego somaram 233 mil, abaixo das 240 mil solicitações previstas.\nemb-vmt/er/val/dga/am/rpr\n© Agence France-Presse\nAs mais lidas agora Água com limão é boa para quê?

    "text": "Rogers impressed by Tuchel’s ‘aura and demeanour’\nAston Villa forward Morgan Rogers says Thomas Tuchel’s “aura” could help fire England to World Cup glory next year.\nTuchel, who began work as Gareth Southgate’s successor in January, met up with his players for the first time on Monday ahead of qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.\nThe German held a team meeting on Monday night where he outlined his mission for glory in North America next summer and Rogers said he has never worked with a manager with such presence.\n“When I met him his aura and demeanour, it’s hard to describe but he has that level of confidence, that level of respect already,” he said.\n“The presence is a bit different. Certain managers have different ways about them. Certainly his aura is one I’ve not experienced before. That’s different to what I’ve faced before.\n“You can see the way he is, the way he acts. He has been so chilled and calm. But when it is time to work, it is time to work.\n“(Winning the World Cup) is the only goal, he was very clear and transparent with what he wants to do, how he wants to do it, how he wants to go about it, what he sees in us, and what we need to improve.\n“It was very straight-up, no cutting round corners. It was straight and that’s how he is. The best way to get information across is to be like that.” Rogers could well be one of the key players in the US next summer given his meteoric rise since joining Villa from Middlesbrough at the start of 2024.\nHe has helped Villa through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Champions League, with Unai Emery’s men also in the race for the top four in the Premier League.\nRogers has come a long way since he used to play against Jude Bellingham at Under-15s level, with the pair now competing against each other for a spot in the England team.\n“I don’t really see it as a rivalry. That’s more of a fan thing where they’ll pitch us against each other to start,” he added.\n“When I’m here I don’t think about that at all. I want to play every game, of course, but you don’t really see it as competition. You’re just friends enjoying the moment and experience.\n“When we were Under-15s, I think we had Birmingham in our group so we played them home and away. I remember that one vividly, I always bring it up to him. He’s never beaten me.\n“He’s always had a mouth on him. Always a wind-up. But we’ve had a really good relationship and to be with him now is really nice.\n“Our careers and paths have been completely different but we have always been in contact along the journey which is really nice and always been not far from each other where we grew up. It makes it a bit sweeter. It’s really nice.”",

    "text": "MLB Trade Deadline Disappointing road trip leaves Giants facing huge deadline decisions By Alex Pavlovic • Published 15 mins ago • Updated 16 mins ago Share NBC Universal, Inc. LOS ANGELES -- There are pivot points in every season, and on Thursday morning, the Giants were hopeful they had witnessed an important one the night before .\nRobbie Ray had nearly been knocked out in the first inning of his season debut. That would have not only wrecked the bullpen, it likely would have led to a third straight loss at Dodger Stadium, and extinguished the hope that the rotation could be dominant down the stretch.\nSome in the clubhouse had the same thought as they watched Ray's shaky first inning: \"It's over.\" Ray, however, fought back. His debut ultimately was so dominant that the Giants felt they had finally grabbed a sliver of momentum.\nStay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter. \"Because of where we are, that was a huge inning to get through,\" manager Bob Melvin said on Thursday morning. \"And winning the game was obviously big for us, as well.\"\nThere is no avoiding where they are. The Giants try not to think about it, but they know the math. Just in case any don't, their president of baseball operations spelled it out for them on KNBR two weeks ago, saying it was time to show something or else he might sell.\nFor two weeks, Farhan Zaidi has been waiting for a sign. In the most unimaginable way, it seemed to be there on Thursday afternoon.\nA shortstop who hit one homer in 155 at-bats before the Giants cut him loose took one of their best relievers deep, pushing his stunned former teammates to six games under .500 and handing them a 2-5 road trip at the worst possible time.\nSan Francisco Giants\nLogan Webb 2 hours ago What we learned as Giants' late comeback spoiled in loss to Dodgers Jordan Hicks 7 hours ago Giants notes: Hicks' bullpen move is imminent; Hill brings spark Nick Ahmed's solo shot on his second day in Dodger Blue was the difference. When Shohei Ohtani, the biggest target of what the Giants felt could be a huge offseason, hit his own homer, the Dodgers had a 6-4 win .\nThe Giants?\nWell, they have a lot of decisions to make.\nThey have just four games until MLB's July 30 trade deadline, and they're set up well with the Colorado Rockies coming to town. But an organization probably should not make macro decisions based on four home games against a last-place team. If Zaidi was waiting to see something, the roster hasn't shown it.\nZaidi said during that appearance on July 11 that the players would show the right direction. The Giants have lost six of 10 since. How does the clubhouse make the case before Tuesday's deadline that the group should be kept together?\n\"I'm a player here, I just work here,\" ace Logan Webb said. \"I don't know what he's going to do. The only thing we can do is try to win, like we have. We'll try to do a better job of that, I guess.\"\nWebb said the Giants are not feeling the pressure of what has been hanging over them for weeks. That pressure should be there, all the time, he pointed out. He also said the talent has been there all along. But something has been missing.\n\"I think we just haven't played that well, including myself,\" he said. \"I haven't done great.\"\nRay set the Giants up to try and salvage a split behind their ace, but Webb was charged with four runs in five innings, pushing his total to 15 runs allowed over his last three starts. On the other side, the Giants repeatedly struck out when they got runners on against Clayton Kershaw, who was making his season debut.\nThe Dodgers couldn't hold the lead they had built for their longtime ace, but Ahmed stunned Tyler Rogers in the eighth, driving a low sinker over the wall. Ohtani followed with a soaring solo shot. On vibes alone, the decision seems easy.\nThen, of course, there's the cold, hard math. The Giants are 5 1/2 games back of the final Wild Card spot. Only three teams in the NL have a worse record. But this is a decision with fascinating layers to it.\nIf Zaidi feels comfortable that he'll be back next year, there seems little doubt that he should sell. He has the starting pitchers that this market is missing. He has relievers that could help any contender. He has multiple veterans -- LaMonte Wade Jr., Michael Conforto and Mike Yastrzemski stand out -- who would carry varying levels of attraction to buyers. He could ship out some other pieces and clear at-bats for prospects like Marco Luciano and Luis Matos, or innings for young pitchers.\nBut many within the organization sense that Zaidi is feeling the pressure to win this year. He put this team together knowing that the rotation would be as good as any in the second half, and it looks like that might be the case.\nThe plan never was to be under .500 when they all got back to full strength, but the Giants are going to have a hard time giving up on a group led by Webb, Blake Snell and Ray, who threw five no-hit innings in his return.\nAs players warmed up Thursday morning, a Dodgers coach came over to chat with some Giants and noted that the teams don't play again this season. \"I'm glad we don't have to see that pitching again,\" he yelled.\nNobody would want to see this rotation in October, but the Giants have a long, long way to go to get there. During the biggest road trip of their season, they proved wholly incapable of being able to find their way.\nRay stopped the bleeding on Wednesday. A few hours later, pitching mistakes and far too many strikeouts kept the Giants from building on his start.\n\"It's not good enough right now,\" Melvin said. \"It's not what we expected. It's not what we wanted. We've got to go home and play better.\"\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\nThis article tagged under: MLB Trade Deadline Share Medal Count Complete Olympic coverage MOST POPULAR MLB Trade Deadline Report: Three Giants hitters could be available at MLB trade deadline 49ers Training Camp 49ers training camp takeaways: Gross-Matos makes case for Bosa bookend Javon Hargrave Hargrave details challenges of adjusting to intense 49ers D-line Steph Curry KD loved Steph's great one-liner about Team USA's Olympics opponents Logan Webb What we learned as Giants' late comeback spoiled in loss to Dodgers Latest Podcasts Giants’ potential trade deadline philosophy, importance of upcoming Dodgers series SEE MORE",

    "text": "Europe’s next big space mission – a telescope that will hunt for Earth-like rocky planets outside of our solar system – is on course to launch at the end of 2026.\nPLATO, or PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars, is being built to find nearby potentially habitable worlds around Sun-like stars that we can examine in detail.\nThe space telescope will blast into orbit on Europe’s new rocket, Ariane-6, which made its maiden flight last week after being developed at a cost of €4billion (£3.4billion).\nDr David Brown, of the University of Warwick, is giving an update on the mission at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting at the University of Hull this week.\n“PLATO’s goal is to search for exoplanets around stars similar to the Sun and at orbital periods long enough for them to be in the habitable zone,” he said.\n“One of the main mission objectives is to find another Earth-Sun equivalent pair, but it is also designed to carefully and precisely characterise the exoplanets that it finds (i.e. work out their masses, radii, and bulk density).”\nPLATO isn’t just an exoplanet hunter, however. It is also a stellar science mission.\nAs well as searching for exoplanets it will study the stars using a range of techniques including asteroseismology (measuring the vibrations and oscillations of stars) to work out their masses, radii, and ages.\nUnlike most space telescopes, PLATO has multiple cameras – including a UK-named one called ArthurEddington, after the famous astronomer and physicist who won the Royal Astronomical Society’s prestigious Gold Medal in 1924.\nIt has 24 ‘Normal’ cameras (N-CAMs) and 2 ‘Fast’ cameras (F-CAMs). The N-CAMs are arranged into four groups of six cameras, with the cameras in each group pointing in the same direction but the groups slightly offset.\nThis gives PLATO a very large field of view, improved scientific performance, redundancy against failures, and a built-in way to identify ‘false positive’ signals that might mimic an exoplanet transit, Dr Brown explained.\n“The planned observing strategy is to stare at two patches of sky, one in the North and one in the South, for two years each,” he added.\n“The Southern patch of sky has been chosen, while the Northern patch won’t be confirmed for another few years.”\nSeveral of the spacecraft’s components have finished their manufacturing programmes and are close to completing their calibration tests. This includes the UK-provided Front-End Electronics (FEE) for the N-CAMs.\nBuilt by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory of University College London, these operate the cameras, digitise the images, and transfer them to the onboard data processing.\nTen of the final cameras have been built and tested and the first of these was mounted onto the optical bench – the surface which keeps all cameras pointed in the right direction – earlier this year.\nThe mission is on track to launch in December 2026.",
