    "text": "It is the time of year when families spending days together at home often start a challenging new jigsaw puzzle. But many fall at the first hurdle by failing to have the right-sized surface for all the pieces. Now that problem has been solved by a research paper revealing that the best table size is just under twice the size of the assembled puzzle. Data scientist Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher and her quantum physicist husband Dr Kent Bonsma-Fisher concluded this after completing nine jigsaws, with the number of pieces ranging from nine to 2,000. They found an unassembled jigsaw puzzle takes up an area about 1.7 times its finished size. A research paper has revealed that the best table size to do a puzzle on is just under twice the size of the assembled puzzle (Stock image) Data scientist Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher and her quantum physicist husband Dr Kent Bonsma-Fisher concluded this after completing nine jigsaws, with the number of pieces ranging from nine to 2,000 (Stock image) The researchers laid out and measured the pieces for each puzzle, placing them as naturally as possible, not artificially close to each other. Then they painstakingly completed each jigsaw and worked out the length and width of the assembled picture. To their surprise, a simple theory predicted the area needed for the pieces regardless of the number. Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher, of the University of Toronto, said she 'gasped' at the discovery. 'The results were the most incredible agreement between theory and data I've ever seen in over a decade of being a physicist,' she added. The research was reported by New Scientist and published on the open-access website arXiv.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 11:30:05\nA cell phone that turns off without warning, or a car breakdown? Yes, it can be caused by low temperatures. But why do batteries discharge faster in these conditions?\nThis will also interest you\n[EN VIDÉO] From Volta to graphene: the evolution of batteries The most common type of battery is the lithium-ion battery. Several technologies are on…\nThere are two main elements to know in a battery: the electrodeselectrodes and the electrolyte. The electrodes are theanodeanodeor negative pole, and the cathodecathodeor positive pole, between which circulate the electronselectrons. The passage of electrons from one pole to the other provides theenergyenergy necessary for the operation of a device, or for its recharging — we will see in a moment that their direction of circulation is important.\nNo time to read? Listen to the answer in our episode of Science or Fiction on the subject! © Futura\nBut, to circulate, electrons need a medium in which to evolve. Thus, between the cathode and the anode, there is a liquidliquid called “conductor” called electrolyte. THE ionsions which make up this electrolyte are in movementmovement, and it is this mobility which generates current by circulating electrons. This set of electrodes and electrolyte forms what is called a cell which allows energy to be generated.\nA battery is made up of thousands of cells working together. So, when we use our cell phone for example, the electrical circuit is in a so-called “closed” state. This means that the anode loses electrons and the cathode will recover them. In other words, it is the phenomenon that creates enough electricity for you to use your smartphone all day long. Conversely, when you recharge the battery, the chemical process that takes place is reversed: this time, the electrical circuit is open, and the electrons then go in the opposite direction.\nBatteries facing winter temperatures\nAll the chemical reactionschemical reactions which lead to the proper functioning of a battery are not necessarily adapted to climatesclimates extremes. Under low temperatures, a battery will produce much less current. And for good reason, chemical reactions take place more slowly. The electrolyte loses its ability to conductivityconductivity. It is more viscous, and its voltage increases, so the movement of electrons, from one electrode to another, is more complicated, and therefore greatly slowed down. In this context, the energy consumed will mainly generate enough heatheat to simply operate the battery which therefore discharges much more quickly. This is why it is better to store your phone in an inside pocket in very cold weather.winterwinter.\nIf this is not possible for you, know that there are also so-called “low temperature” batteries which will withstand these conditions. These batteries work thanks to a modification made to one of the electrodes. The anode in the batteries of an ordinary telephone is in graphitegraphiteand materialmaterial which tends to perform less well in winter. To deal with this problem, researchers have succeeded in developing a battery with a new anode in carbonecarbone called “non-graphitizable”. The principle remains the same, but this new material allows electron transfers under -40°C.\nThat said, this technology is valid for cell phones but, for cars, it is more complicated. For the moment, the solution found by certain countries experiencing episodes of extreme cold would be to connect the carscars on electricity inlets in car parks to keep the engine, oil and battery warm.\n1703868253\n#batteries #discharge #faster #cold",

    "text": "Filipe d’Avillez and John Pontifex (ZENIT News / Nigeria, 12.28.2023).- CHURCH leaders have confirmed the killing of more than 160 people in Nigeria’s Middle Belt over Christmas, attacks which they say saw the “deliberate targeting” of Christians. The killing spree began on 23rd December and went on for four days, with 26 villages in Plateau State coming under fire. Speaking to Aid to the Church in Need (ACN), the Catholic charity for persecuted and other suffering Christians, Father Andrew Dewan, director of communications of Pankshin Diocese where the attacks took place, described how “people were summarily shot and killed”, with churches, clinics and grain stores torched. Describing the scene in Tudun Mazat, which he had visited only that morning for Christmas Mass, Father Dewan said: “The attackers stormed the community in the evening, just about the time most people were eating their dinner… “Before people could raise the alarm, the bandits were already upon them. “People were summarily shot and killed, houses and corn that had been harvested were set ablaze, churches and clinics were also set on fire.” He said that very night 20 other communities were attacked in what bore all the signs of coordinated attacks. Confirming reports that Fulani militia or mercenaries were to blame, he said that survivors and eyewitnesses reported that in mixed Fulani/Christian communities “not one Fulani was affected and no Fulani houses were burned”. Father Dewan said: “The unprovoked attacks were well-coordinated and deliberate, targeting communities that were Christians specifically. “I live in this same community and can confirm that in the areas where these attacks took place the victims were 100 percent Christians, except for a few. But even at that, the non-Christians were isolated.” He added: “For those who believe that this conflict is not religious, this latest attack proves that it is clearly a religious conflict. “The fact that it took place at Christmas, and the deliberate targeting of Christians in a mixed community where Muslims are not attacked, clearly bears all the hallmarks of a religious conflict.” Father Dewan said that up to 167 fatalities had been confirmed in attacks on villages centred on Bokkos, but also involving Barkin Ladi and Mangu. He said the total dead “is definitely going to rise because there are still many people in hospitals, with varying degrees of injuries and wounds.” Condemning the “senseless killing”, Regina Lynch, Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International executive president, said: “Our Christian brothers and sisters killed in Nigeria, and in other countries of the world, are the ‘Holy Innocents’ of the 21st century. “The bloodshed as followers of Jesus will, we are sure, be the seed of new Christians.” She added: “We call on the government to finally confront this problem and provide safety to its citizens and urge our friends and benefactors to keep praying for Nigeria, just as we pledge to continue helping in whatever way we can.”",

    "title": "You Can Now Edit Text in Images Using Alibaba’s AnyText",
    "text": "In a significant breakthrough, Alibaba has successfully addressed the long-standing challenge of integrating coherent and readable text into images with the introduction of AnyText. This state-of-the-art framework for multilingual visual text generation and editing marks a remarkable advancement in the realm of text-to-image synthesis. Let’s delve into the intricacies of AnyText, exploring its methodology, core components, and practical applications.\nAlso Read:\nDecoding Google VideoPoet: A Comprehensive Guide to AI Video Generation\nCore Components of Alibaba’s AnyText\n- Diffusion-Based Architecture: AnyText’s groundbreaking technology revolves around a diffusion-based architecture, consisting of two primary modules: the auxiliary latent module and the text embedding module.\n- Auxiliary Latent Module: Responsible for handling inputs such as text glyphs, positions, and masked images, the auxiliary latent module plays a pivotal role in generating latent features essential for text generation or editing. By integrating various features into the latent space, it provides a robust foundation for the visual representation of text.\n- Text Embedding Module: Leveraging an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model, the text embedding module encodes stroke data into embeddings. These embeddings, combined with image caption embeddings from a tokenizer, result in texts seamlessly blending with the background. This innovative approach ensures accurate and coherent text integration.\n- Text-Control Diffusion Pipeline: At the core of AnyText lies the text-control diffusion pipeline. It is what facilitates the high-fidelity integration of text into images. This pipeline employs a combination of diffusion loss and text perceptual loss during training to enhance the accuracy of the generated text. The result is a visually pleasing and contextually relevant incorporation of text into images.\nAnyText’s Multilingual Capabilities\nA notable feature of AnyText is its ability to write characters in multiple languages, making it the first framework to address the challenge of multilingual visual text generation. The model supports Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Bengali, and Hindi, offering a diverse range of language options for users.\nAlso Read:\nMidJourney v6 Is Here to Revolutionize AI Image Generation\nPractical Applications and Results\nAnyText’s versatility extends beyond basic text addition. It can imitate various text materials, including chalk characters on a blackboard and traditional calligraphy. The model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to ControlNet in both Chinese and English, with significantly reduced FID errors.\nOur Say\nAlibaba’s AnyText emerges as a game-changer in the field of text-to-image synthesis. Its ability to seamlessly integrate text into images across multiple languages, coupled with its versatile applications, positions it as a powerful tool for visual storytelling. The framework’s open-sourced nature, available on GitHub, further encourages collaboration and development in the ever-evolving field of text generation technology. AnyText heralds a new era in multilingual visual text editing, paving the way for enhanced visual storytelling and creative expression in the digital landscape.\nRelated\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "text": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. ( WSMV /Gray News) - On Wednesday, after seeing the baseball-sized hail falling in her front yard in Hohenwald, Tennessee, Sandy Goff’s immediate thought was of her son Cody Frizzell and his fiancé.\nFrizzell was driving in Columbia, and Goff knew the storm was heading their way.\n“I couldn’t think of them being out in it. That’s what scared me,” Goff said.\nFrizzell said the sky was bright and sunny when his mother called, warning him of what was coming. He asked her where they should go.\n“Where’s the best place where we could stop and seek shelter? And she said Walmart,” Frizzell said.\nWith his mother still on the line and heavy rain starting to fall, Frizzell said he and his fiancé approached the store at 2200 Brookmeade Drive in Columbia where employees in blue Walmart vests were standing.\n“One of the people stopped (his fiancé) and said, ‘No, you can’t come in. There’s a tornado warning. We’re not letting anyone in,’” Frizzell said. “I said, ‘Where are we supposed to go?’ And she said, ‘I don’t care, but you can’t stay here.’”\nGoff, listening on the line, was irate. “He said they’re not letting us in. And I said, ‘What? What do you mean they’re not letting you in?’” Goff said.\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé weren’t the only ones prevented from entering the store.\n“There was a couple behind us and they weren’t letting them in either,” Frizell said.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with the manager at the Columbia Walmart, but she said she could not comment and referred our questions to corporate communications.\nBrian Little, global communications director for Walmart, wrote in an email to WSMV4 Investigates: “The safety of our customers during weather events like what occurred recently in Columbia, TN is a priority. During the storm customers inside our store as well as others who requested to enter were allowed to shelter in place. While we can’t confirm who this individual spoke with, we do allow people to shelter in place inside our stores.”\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé rushed to another store that agreed to allow them to shelter in place.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with a manager at the store, and she confirmed that they sheltered people who had been turned away from Walmart.\n“I’m angry. Hurt. And if something had happened to them, I don’t know what I would have done,” Goff said.\nCopyright 2024 WSMV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
