    "text": "Arsenal have received two nominations for Player of the Month and one for Manager of the Month from the Premier League in August. Arsenal’s Spanish manager Mikel Arteta gestures on the touchline during the English Premier League football match between Aston Villa and Arsenal at Villa Park in Birmingham, central England on August 24, 2024. (Photo by ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP via Getty Images) With August coming to an end, the Premier League have revealed their nominees for Manager and Player of the Month.\nArsenal’s Mikel Arteta is up for the Manager of the Month award, joining Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler, and Liverpool’s Arne Slot in the running.\nAll four managers went unbeaten in August, with Arteta and Hurzeler facing off in a draw at the end of the month.\nLiverpool’s Slot had a great start, but it’s worth noting that his win over Manchester United came after the month ended. Only his first two victories count towards this award.\nWith that in mind, Guardiola is probably the favourite, given City’s three wins in three games.\nLONDON, ENGLAND: David Raya of Arsenal warms up prior to the pre-season friendly match between Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais at Emirates Stadium on August 11, 2024. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images) As for the Player of the Month award, Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka and David Raya join Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, Aston Villa’s Amadou Onana, Chelsea’s Cole Palmer, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, and Brighton’s Danny Welbeck.\nAgain, Manchester City probably have the favourite here, with Haaland having scored seven goals in three games.\nGoalkeepers rarely win these awards, but Raya had a fantastic month, keeping two clean sheets and winning 10-man Arsenal a point against Brighton. He made vital saves in all three matches to ensure the Gunners started the new season in strong form.\nSaka earned his nomination by providing assists in all three matches, as well as scoring against Wolves. Only Haaland beat his four goal contributions in August.\nLONDON, ENGLAND: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal celebrates scoring his team’s second goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC at Emirates Stadium on August 17, 2024. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) Arteta continues to keep Arsenal on track fighting at the top of the table in 2024/25, but Raya and Saka played a big role in the Gunners’ unbeaten start to the campaign. All three earned their nominations in August.",

    "text": "At least two mass extinction events in Earth's history were likely caused by the \"devastating\" effects of nearby supernova explosions, a new study suggests.\nResearchers at Keele University say these super-powerful blasts – caused by the death of a massive star – may have previously stripped our planet's atmosphere of its ozone, sparked acid rain and exposed life to harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\nThey believe a supernova explosion close to Earth could be to blame for both the late Devonian and Ordovician extinction events, which occurred 372 and 445 million years ago respectively.\nThe Ordovician extinction killed 60 per cent of marine invertebrates at a time when life was largely confined to the sea, while the late Devonian wiped out around 70 per cent of all species and led to huge changes in the kind of fish that existed in our ancient seas and lakes.\nPast research has failed to identify a clear cause for either event, although they are thought to have been linked to the depletion of Earth's ozone layer, which could have been triggered by a supernova.\nThe new study, published today in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , found that the rate supernovae occur near to our planet is consistent with the timings of both mass extinctions.\nThe authors say it is a \"a great illustration for how massive stars can act as both creators and destructors of life\".\nThat's because supernovae are also known to spread the heavy elements that help form and support life across the universe.\nSupernovae occur when massive stars reach the end of their lives, run out of fuel, cool off, and then collapse under the pressure of gravity. The explosions are the biggest humans have ever seen.\nLead author Dr Alexis Quintana, formerly from Keele University and now at the University of Alicante, said: \"Supernova explosions bring heavy chemical elements into the interstellar medium, which are then used to form new stars and planets.\n\"But if a planet, including the Earth, is located too close to this kind of event, this can have devastating effects.\"\nDr Nick Wright, from Keele University, added: \"Supernova explosions are some of the most energetic explosions in the universe.\n\"If a massive star were to explode as a supernova close to the Earth, the results would be devastating for life on Earth. This research suggests that this may have already happened.\"\nThe researchers came to their conclusion after carrying out a \"census\" of massive stars within a kiloparsec (around 3,260 light-years) of the Sun.\nThey were studying the distribution of these massive stars, known as OB stars, to learn more about how star clusters and galaxies form by using the Milky Way itself as a benchmark, and the rate at which these stars form in our galaxy.\nThis census allowed the researchers to calculate the rate at which supernovae occur within the galaxy, which is important for observations of supernovae, and the production of supernova remnants and massive stellar remnants such as black holes and neutron stars throughout the universe.\nThe data will also be useful for future development of gravitational wave detectors, which are a useful tool for scientists studying the structure and origins of the universe.\nAs part of this the research team calculated the supernova rate within 20 parsecs of the Sun, or approximately 65 light-years, and compared this with the approximate rate of mass extinction events on Earth that have previously been attributed to nearby supernovae.\nThis excludes extinction events linked to other factors such as asteroid impacts or the ice ages.\nComparing these data sets, the experts found that their research supported the theory that a supernova explosion was responsible for both the late Devonian and Ordovician extinction events – two of the five known mass extinctions in Earth's history.\n\"We calculated the supernova rate close to Earth and found it to be consistent with the rate of mass extinction events on our planet that have been linked to external forces such as supernovae,\" Dr Wright explained.\nAstronomers believe about one or two supernovae – or possibly at a rate even lower than that – occur each century in galaxies like the Milky Way, but the good news is there are only two nearby stars which could go supernova within the next million years or so: Antares and Betelgeuse.\nHowever, both of these are more than 500 light-years away from us and computer simulations have previously suggested a supernova at that distance from Earth likely wouldn't affect our planet.\nhere.",

    "title": "Década infernal para el planeta: cada año estuvo entre los 10 más cálidos desde que hay registros",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente Ya no se trata de uno, dos o tres récords puntuales de temperatura. De un puñado de días más cálidos de lo normal. O de un periodo puntual donde los termómetros están por encima de lo habitual. Según confirma el último análisis del Servicio Copernicus, el planeta encadena al menos una década de temperaturas cada vez más extremas . Los registros confirman que todos y cada uno de los últimos 10 años estuvo entre los 10 más cálidos desde que hay registros. Y el año pasado, sin ir más lejos, se cerró como el más cálido de la historia y como el primero en superar por completo la línea roja de los 1,5 grados de calentamiento global .\nEl cambio climático visto desde el espacio\nEl último análisis anual elaborado por el Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus –el programa europeo dedicado al estudio del planeta– aporta algunos datos inéditos para entender hasta qué punto la crisis climática se está acelerando y magnificando con el pasar de los años. Los registros confirman, por ejemplo, que 2024 fue el año más cálido para todos los continentes , excepto la Antártida y Australasia, así como para buena parte de los océanos del globo. Sobre todo en el Atlántico Norte, que ha encadenado más de 500 días consecutivos registrando récords diarios de calor, así como en el océano Índico y el océano Pacífico occidental. También se confirma que todos los meses desde enero hasta junio fueron los más cálidos que el mismo mes de cualquier año anterior desde que hay registros.\nLos niveles de vapor de agua en la atmósfera marcaron cifras sin precedentes, lo que contribuyó a la formación de fenómenos extremos como la dana de Valencia En el último año también se han batido varios récords que hasta ahora eran casi impensables. En julio, por ejemplo, se registraron dos días consecutivos en los que se batió el récord absoluto de temperatura media en el conjunto del planeta y por primera vez en la historia se llegó a los 17,16 grados de media. La extensión del hielo marino en la Antártida alcanzó valores mínimos récord por segundo año consecutivo. Y los niveles de vapor de agua en la atmósfera fueron los más altos jamás observados, algo que, según argumentan los expertos, ha contribuido a un auge de fenómenos meteorológicos extremos como tormentas extremas e inundaciones en varias regiones del mundo. Por ejemplo, como lo ocurrido en la dana de Valencia .\nRécord de emisiones Los impactos de la crisis climática en el planeta no solo se reflejan en números y estadísticas. Tal como confirman el análisis de Copernicus, a lo largo del año pasado todas las regiones del mundo registraron algún tipo de extremo climático como, por ejemplo, sequías, incendios de gran magnitud y olas de calor extremo, por un lado, y tormentas, inundaciones y riadas, por el otro. Según apuntan algunos análisis, las 10 catástrofes naturales más dañinas registradas en los últimos meses, entre las que destaca el huracán Milton y las inundaciones de Valencia, causaron daños por más de 228.000 millones de dólares. También se estima que los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos relacionados con el agua , como es el caso de inundaciones y ciclones tropicales, causaron la muerte de más de 8.700 personas en 2024. A estos habría que sumarle los decesos prematuros vinculados al calor extremo, entre otros.\nLas emisiones globales del petróleo, gas y carbón vuelven a marcar un nuevo récord en 2024\nDetrás de estas cifras hay, cómo no, otro preocupante récord que el planeta bate año tras año: el de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero . Según confirman los análisis de Copernicus, el año pasado se volvió a batir récord en la concentración tanto de dióxido de carbono como de metano , las dos sustancias que más están acelerando el aumento global de las temperaturas. También se registraron cifras inéditas de emisiones derivadas de los incendios forestales, especialmente en zonas como Bolivia y Venezuela. Los especialistas reclaman abordar cuanto antes esta cuestión y reducir drásticamente las emisiones ya que, de seguir así, todo apunta a que el caos climático irá a más en las próximas décadas .\n\"El futuro está en nuestras manos; una acción rápida y decisiva aún puede cambiar la trayectoria de nuestro clima futuro\" Carlo Buontempo\n\"La humanidad es dueña de su destino, pero nuestra respuesta al desafío climático debe basarse en pruebas . E l futuro está en nuestras manos; una acción rápida y decisiva aún puede cambiar la trayectoria de nuestro clima futuro \", ha declarado Carlo Buontempo, director del Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus, tras la publicación de estos datos en los que, una vez más, se constata la gravedad del problema.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo",

    "text": "Plus aucun doute ne subsiste. Nos élus, tous gouvernements confondus, sont investis dans une guerre totale contre l’auto. Comme beaucoup de politiciens se sont acoquinés avec le Forum économique mondial ou le C40, lesquels rêvent de nous dépouiller de nos voitures et de nous parquer dans des «Villes 15 minutes», l’appauvrissement qu’ils glorifient n’est guère surprenant. Cauchemar Car oui, forcer le peuple à abandonner l’auto au profit du vélo, c’est l’appauvrir. C’est la tiers-mondialisation de notre mode de vie au moyen de méthodes punitives et via la dégradation de nos villes en cauchemar pour automobilistes. L’énergie fossile est polluante? Alors innovons dans des carburants verts comme les e-fuels! Car même si le vélo est «vert», il présente d’importants coûts sociaux et sociétaux. Le vélo est discriminatoire. Il ignore les besoins des personnes âgées, et des familles avec de jeunes enfants, et des personnes à mobilité réduite ou souffrant de conditions médicales ou de surpoids. Le vélo est peu pratique. Il est difficilement praticable en hiver. Il limite la capacité à transporter les charges lourdes ou volumineuses, et à parcourir de longues distances. Et il impose des contraintes vestimentaires potentiellement incompatibles avec certaines activités professionnelles et certaines occasions. Et vu la criminalité galopante, le vélo est peu sécuritaire. Il rend le cycliste vulnérable, particulièrement lors des déplacements en soirée ou dans des quartiers chauds. Le vélo est chronophage. Il nous prive de moments que nous pourrions consacrer à d’autres activités plus utiles et plus satisfaisantes. Et que penser de la productivité de l’individu qui arrive à son travail épuisé et dégoulinant de sueur après avoir longuement pédalé? Harcèlement Ça suffit avec le harcèlement de l’utopie cycliste! L’auto permet le confort, l’autonomie, la liberté et la productivité. S’en priver, c’est jeter le bébé avec l’eau du bain. Investissons donc dans la rechercher sur les e-fuels plutôt que dans les pistes cyclables.",

    "title": "Papal Biographer: Pope Benedict Was ‘Bitterly Disappointed’ by Pope Francis",
    "text": "ROME — Peter Seewald, close friend and collaborator of Pope Benedict XVI, said Thursday that Benedict was “stabbed in the heart” by Pope Francis’ attacks on the traditional Latin Mass.\nSeewald, a German journalist who worked with Joseph Ratzinger — the future Benedict XVI — for over 25 years, said that Pope Francis has done his best to\neradicate the legacy of his immediate predecessor in every way possible.\nFrancis’ words at the requiem Mass for Benedict XVI “were as cold as the whole ceremony, which had to be brief so as not to honor his predecessor too much,” Seewald told La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana.\nPope Francis “seems to have an aversion to the westernized traditions of the Catholic Church,” said Seewald. “As a South American and a Jesuit, he has erased much of what was precious and dear to Ratzinger.”\n“Suffice it to recall the ban on the Tridentine Mass. Benedict had built a small bridge to a largely forgotten treasure island, which until then had only been accessible through difficult terrain,” Benedict’s biographer added.\n“It was a matter close to the German Pope’s heart and there was really no reason to tear down this bridge again. It was obviously a demonstration of the new power,” he said, regarding Francis’ harsh\nrestrictions on the celebration of the Latin Mass.\n“The subsequent purge of staff completed the picture. Many people who supported Ratzinger’s course and Catholic doctrine were guillotined,” he noted.\nSeewald stated that according to his sources, the pope’s claim that the majority of bishops had voted in favor of repealing Benedict’s Summorum Pontificum in a worldwide poll is simply “not true.”\n“What I find particularly shameful is that the Pope Emeritus was not even informed of this act but had to learn about it from the press. He was stabbed in the heart,” he said.\nIn his interview, Seewald also criticized Pope Francis’ severe treatment of close colleagues and supporters of Pope Benedict, such as Cardinal Gerhard Müller, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland, Cardinal Raymond Burke, and Archbishop Georg Gänswein, Benedict’s loyal secretary.\n“It was an unprecedented event in the history of the Church that Archbishop Gänswein, the closest collaborator of a highly deserving Pope, the greatest theologian ever to sit on the See of Peter, was thrown out of the Vatican in disgrace,” Seewald said. “He was not even given a word of pro forma thanks for his work.”\n“Of course, the purge primarily concerned the man whose lineage Gänswein represents, Benedict XVI,” Seewald stated. “More recently, it was the American Bishop Strickland, Benedict’s friend and a critic of Bergoglio, who was removed from office on the pretext of financial misconduct, an obviously implausible reason.”\n“And when a Ratzinger supporter like 75-year-old Cardinal Burke is deprived overnight of his home and salary without any explanation, it is difficult to recognize the Christian fraternity in all this,” he added.\nAsked to comment on Francis’ appointment of his fellow Argentinian Víctor Manuel Fernández to head up the Vatican’s powerful doctrinal office, Seewald noted that Fernández’s incompetence was apparently less important than his fawning devotion to Francis.\nFernández, who was quickly given a cardinal’s hat, “is not qualified for this important task, except for one thing: he is the protégé of an Argentinian Pope,” Seewald said. “Until now ability was the main criterion for these appointments, but under Bergoglio it seems it is loyalty to the line that counts.”\nEven before taking office, Fernández had said he “wanted to change the catechism, relativize Bible statements and question celibacy,” Seewald said.\nFernández has used the ruse of “an expanded understanding of things” as “the door to be able to legitimize previously unknown interpretations of the Catholic faith,” he stated.\nIn his new role as prefect, Fernández has been exempted from having to deal with sexual abuse in the Church, Seewald observed, wryly adding that Fernández is no stranger to this topic since, as archbishop of La Plata, “he had covered up at least eleven cases of sexual abuse by priests.”",

    "text": "Guest Post by [Martin Armstrong](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/war/americans-have-invaded-kursk-inside-russia/) [Last June, Biden lifted the ban on American contractors sending mercenaries into Ukraine. When he lifted the ban on American weapons, allowing them to be deployed inside Russia, this was another step that de facto allowed these private American military operations to invade Russia pretending it is not the official United States. I have warned that the Neocons are scared to death of Trump, and if RFK joins Trump as the Attorney General, as I have been arguing behind the curtain, they are desperate to start World War III before the election.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine/index.html) Sources are reporting that Stephanie Holmes, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Russia, was summoned to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain why Americans have invaded Russia with the invasion of the Ukrainian Army into the Kursk region. By 2008, the US Department of Defense employed 155,826 private contractors in Iraq — and 152,275 troops. This degree of privatization is unprecedented in modern warfare. The Neocons used Biden to circumvent Congress to create World War III, deploying private armies to negate Congressional approval. Indeed, Russia has an opportunity to now annihilate the entire invading force, including Americans, by deploying a small tactical nuclear weapon inside its own borders. Nobody can say anything about that, and Russia would be within its right to do so just as if Chinese, Russian, or North Korean private military invaded the United States. September has been a significant target on our computer all year for civil unrest and international war. Gold’s performance appears linked to this action, whereas silver and platinum have not responded. While gold may peak by next week, September remains a major Panic Cycle in many markets, including gold. Russia is certainly within its right to use whatever means necessary to eradicate this invading force. If it does not respond on its own territory, then it would only invite a full-scale NATO invasion. These Neocons are traitors to the United States and the future of our nation, all for their personal hatred of Russians. It is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best unbiased information available, and a forum where it can be discussed openly, as our Founders intended. But it is not easy nor inexpensive to do so, especially when those who wish to prevent us from making the truth known, attack us without mercy on all fronts on a daily basis.

I can't do it all alone, and I need your help and support to keep it alive.

    "text": "Laura Laplaud with AFP 11:09 a.m., March 10, 2024 Fabien Roussel, national secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF), was the guest of the Grand Rendez-vous Europe 1/CNews/Les Échos. The National Assembly examines the French aid strategy for Ukraine on Tuesday, during a debate followed by a symbolic vote, which will above all serve as a confrontation between the majority, the National Rally and La France insoumise, this three months before the European elections. >> Find the Grand Rendez-vous every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Europe 1 as well as in podcast and replay here Emmanuel Macron “puts on the clothes of a war leader” “For the RN, facing Russia, all weakness, all weakness is good,” said Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Saturday during a meeting in Lille, thus setting the likely tone at the Palais-Bourbon on Tuesday. The oppositions have repeatedly condemned the recent outings of President Macron, who does not rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine and wants \"no limits\" in support for kyiv. A “worrying” posture for Fabien Roussel, national secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF), guest of the Grand Rendez-vous Europe 1/CNews/Les Échos. Is Emmanuel Macron seeking to use the war in Ukraine for domestic political purposes? Yes, according to the national secretary of the PCF. “I think he is jabbing his chin with warlike language, but that he himself does not believe for a single moment that France is going to get involved in this. He is waving a counterfire, a way of diverting attention of the French on this conflict and in the meantime, there is a catastrophe in France. The social situation is deplorable, the purchasing power of the French is melting like snow in the sun and there is no response being provided, whether for farmers, for employees, for our public services. It is a way for him to put on the clothes of a war leader while waging a social war which does a lot of harm to our country\", assured Fabien Roussel. “France does not need a French-style George Bush” \"I have the feeling that he thinks he is the American head of state Bush in 2003. We do not need a Bush in France. We do not need a military leader in France, we \"We need a coalition for peace, and to bring peace to Europe,\" he said. Concerning the Franco-Ukrainian security agreement of February 16 examined Tuesday in the Assembly, Fabien Roussel assures him, \"if the Prime Minister's speech takes up the elements that are in the treaty that Mr. Macron signed with Volodymyr Zelensky, we will vote against.” “We are at the dawn of a dangerous military escalation” \"This treaty says several things. It says in particular that Ukraine must join NATO. It's a provocation, it's stupidity. And besides, Ukraine will never join NATO because that will be part of the discussions. The other thing is that it says 'unlimited military support' [...] today, we are crossing a dangerous threshold for the future of Europe and for peace in Europe and we do not want to cross this threshold. For us, the party of peace, it is as if we assassinated Jean Jaurès a second time. We are at the dawn of a dangerous military escalation\", assured the deputy from the North. The Franco-Ukrainian agreement, concluded for a period of ten years, includes a strengthening of military cooperation, particularly in the areas of artillery and air defense. In 2024, Paris promises to provide \"up to 3 billion euros of additional support\", funding that oppositions could question as the government has just announced a series of budget cuts. After the Assembly, a similar debate will be held in the Senate on Wednesday. >> More information to follow... >> More information to follow...",

    "text": "Green hydrogen is emerging as a key player in the clean energy transition. With this thought, Microsoft and Irish energy company ESB have joined forces to launch a groundbreaking pilot project that could reshape the way data centers are powered. To decarbonize its operations, the tech giant will use green hydrogen (H2) fuel cells to generate clean electricity at its Dublin campus.\nMicrosoft Switches to Green Hydrogen to Tackle Scope 3 Emissions Microsoft’s move to adopt green hydrogen aligns with its broader sustainability goals. In 2020, the tech giant committed to becoming carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste by 2030. This latest project not only supports that vision but also demonstrates how hydrogen technology can play a critical role in decarbonizing sectors like data centers, which are significant energy consumers.\nLavinia Morris, General Manager, of Microsoft’s EMEA Data Centre Operations, remarked,\n “This pilot project is another important step in our journey to transition to carbon-free electricity supply for our data centers, buildings, and campuses around the world. As we look to advance a more sustainable future, we hope to build on the success of this pilot project and continue to find innovative ways to decarbonize our operations.”\nHowever, recent reports reveal that Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions in 2023 were 30% higher than in 2020. The rise in emissions is largely driven by the expansion of data centers to meet the growing demand for AI computing power. Consequently, switching to blue hydrogen is one way to tackle the Scope 3 emissions.\nSource: Microsoft 2024 sustainability report\nThis pilot project also adheres to the ‘Principles for Sustainable Data Centre Development’ outlined by the Irish government. By ensuring efficient use of the electricity grid and promoting the use of renewable energy, Microsoft is contributing to the country’s sustainability goals.\nREAD MORE : Fortescue Launches Innovative Green Metal Project in Australia, Fueled by Green Hydrogen! ESB’s Innovative Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Zero Emissions, Maximum Impact Hydrogen is emerging as a vital component of the clean energy transition. It’s especially valuable for sectors where renewable solutions like wind and solar are less practical. ESB’s hydrogen fuel cells can potentially replace diesel generators and offer a carbon-free alternative that can power critical infrastructure without any carbon emissions.\nMicrosoft’s press release explains that the pilot project will run for eight weeks. Significantly it is the first time that hydrogen fuel cells will be used to provide electricity to Microsoft’s data center in Europe. These zero-emission fuel cells, designed by ESB, will deliver up to 250 kW of power to Microsoft’s data center and administration building in Dublin.\nThe key feature of hydrogen fuel cells is their ability to convert stored green hydrogen into electricity. The only byproduct? Pure water. Unlike traditional diesel generators, these cells produce no carbon emissions or harmful air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), or particulate matter. This makes them an ideal solution for reducing the environmental and health impacts often associated with backup power systems.\nEoin Doherty, Vice President, EMEA Regional Leader, Microsoft Cloud Operations + Innovation, said,\n“The green hydrogen project we’re launching with ESB is a pioneering first for Microsoft in Europe, demonstrating how zero-emissions hydrogen can be harnessed to power our digital lives. If scaled successfully, it could provide new ways of advancing sustainability in our sector and beyond.”\nAdditionally, Jim Dollard, ESB Executive Director, Generation and Trading, commented,\n“ESB believes green hydrogen will play an important role in the net zero energy system of the future. We’re delighted to be working with Microsoft on this innovative pilot project that will showcase the potential for green hydrogen as part of zero-emission electricity generation for data centers.”\nNotably, the Dublin pilot is just the start of a broader shift to hydrogen power across Europe. ESB aims to expand hydrogen fuel cell projects in 2024 and 2025, showcasing its versatility in various energy applications.\nGreen hydrogen capacity targets and consumption potentials in selected countries in the EU in 2030\nSource: Statista\nMicrosoft’s collaboration with ESB highlights the role hydrogen can play in reshaping energy production and consumption. With growing sectors like AI and cloud computing, the demand for cleaner power is more urgent than ever. By adopting hydrogen fuel cells, Microsoft is demonstrating how innovative solutions can help meet these challenges and reduce emissions.\nSource: Microsoft announces pioneering green hydrogen pilot project with ESB\nFURTHER READING : Shell Powers Europe With A Mega 100MW Green Hydrogen Electrolyzer",
