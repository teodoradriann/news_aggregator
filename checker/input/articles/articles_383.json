    "title": "Tunisian imam expelled by France says to appeal decision",
    "text": "SOLIMAN, Tunisia: A Tunisian imam expelled from France for alleged hate speech said on Friday he would take legal action in a bid to overturn the decision.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi, from the town of Bagnols-sur-Ceze in the south of France, denounced his removal as “arbitrary.”\nThe 52-year-old was arrested and then deported to Tunisia on Thursday, where he arrived shortly before midnight aboard a flight from Paris.\nMahjoubi had been in France since the 1980s and is married with five children.\nAll of his family are French citizens, but he is not and had his residency permit canceled on Sunday by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin.\nThe official order for Mahjoubi’s expulsion, seen by AFP, said that in sermons in February he had given a “retrograde, intolerant and violent” image of Islam that would encourage behavior against French values, discrimination against women, “tensions with the Jewish community” and “jihadist radicalization.”\nThe imam also referred to “the Jewish people as the enemy,” according to the order, which said Mahjoubi called for “the destruction of Western society.”\nThe imam was also accused of sharing a video in which he described the “tricolor” — without specifying if he meant the French flag — as “satanic” and of “no value with Allah.”\nMahjoubi defending himself, saying it had been a “slip of the tongue” and that he was referring to rivalries between football supporters of different Maghrebi nations during the recent African Cup of Nations.\n“I will fight to return to France where I have lived for 40 years,” the imam told AFP in his in-laws’ house in Soliman, 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Tunis.\nMahjoubi, who runs a construction company, said his family, including his youngest child who is in hospital for cancer treatment, depended entirely on him.\n“My lawyer is going to take legal action in France if the court does not grant me justice, I will appeal, and then I will appeal to the European Court” of Human Rights, he added.\n“I did not insult the Jewish community, nor the flag of France,” he said.\nOn Thursday, Darmanin posted on social media that the expulsion was a “demonstration” that a recently approved immigration law “makes France stronger.”\nThe law toughening migration conditions was seen as part of the government’s response to the rise of the far-right in French opinion polls.\n“Firmness is the rule,” said Darmanin, who slammed what he called a “radical imam who made unacceptable comments.”\nMahjoubi denounced the expulsion as being based on “an arbitrary decision,” and said Darmanin was using his case to “create a buzz around the immigration law.”\nTunisian imam expelled by France says to appeal decision\nhttps://arab.news/9auyx\nTunisian imam expelled by France says to appeal decision\n- Mahjoub Mahjoubi, from the town of Bagnols-sur-Ceze in the south of France, denounced his removal as “arbitrary“\n- The 52-year-old was arrested and then deported to Tunisia

of law\n- ‘Israel has repeatedly failed to comply with international law,’ say experts\nGENEVA: Any transfer of weapons or ammunition to Israel that would be used in Gaza is likely to violate international humanitarian law and must cease immediately, UN experts warned on Friday.\n“All states must ‘ensure respect’ for international humanitarian law by parties to an armed conflict, as required by 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary international law,” a media statement quoted the experts as saying.\n“States must accordingly refrain from transferring any weapon or ammunition — or parts for them — if it is expected, given the facts or past patterns of behavior, that they would be used to violate international law.”\nAccording to the experts, such transfers are prohibited even if the exporting state does not intend the arms to be used in violation of the law — or does not know with certainty that they would be used in such a way — as long as there is a clear risk.\nMeanwhile, the UN experts welcomed the decision of a Dutch appeals court on Feb. 12 ordering the Netherlands to halt the export of F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel.\nThe court found that there was a “clear risk” that the parts would be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law, as “there are many indications that Israel has violated the humanitarian law of war in a not insignificant number of cases.”\nIsrael has repeatedly failed to comply with international law, said the experts.\nThey noted that states party to the Arms Trade Treaty have additional treaty obligations to deny arms exports if they “know” that the arms “would” be used to commit international crimes, or if there is an “overriding risk” that the arms transferred “could” be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law.\nEU member states are further bound by the bloc’s arms export control laws.\n“The need for an arms embargo on Israel is heightened by the International Court of Justice’s ruling on Jan. 26, 2024, that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and the continuing serious harm to civilians since then,” the experts said.\nThe Genocide Convention of 1948 requires states parties to employ all means reasonably available to them to prevent genocide in another state as far as possible.\n“This necessitates halting arms exports in the present circumstances,” the experts added.\nThey further welcomed the suspension of arms transfers to Israel by Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the Japanese company Itochu Corp.\nThe EU also recently discouraged arms exports to Israel.\nMoreover, the experts urged other states to immediately halt arms transfers to Israel, including export licenses and military aid.\nThe US and Germany are by far the largest arms exporters and shipments have increased since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7. Other military exporters include France, the UK, Canada and Australia.\nThe experts further noted that arms transfers to Hamas and other armed groups are also prohibited by international law, given their grave violations of international humanitarian law during the October attack, including hostage-taking and subsequent indiscriminate rocket fire.\nThe duty to “ensure respect” for humanitarian law applies “in all circumstances”, including when Israel claims it is countering terrorism.\nMilitary intelligence must also not be shared where there is a clear risk that it would be used to violate international humanitarian law.\n“State officials involved in arms exports may be individually criminally liable for aiding and abetting any war crimes, crimes against humanity or acts of genocide,” the experts said.\nIsrael kills 3 paramedics, Hezbollah official in Lebanon\n- The airstrike targeted the top floor of a building in a residential neighborhood on the Kafr Rumman-Marjayoun Highway, killing Saleh and one other person, and wounding three people\nBEIRUT: Israel killed a top Hezbollah official and three paramedics affiliated with the group in airstrikes on Thursday.\nHassan Mahmoud Saleh, a missile unit commander, was killed in the town of Kafr Rumman. The paramedics, from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority, were killed in the town of Blida.\nThe assassination of Saleh was Israel’s third high-profile strike on top officials belonging to the Axis of Resistance in Lebanon. It follows the killing of Hamas leader Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri and seven others in Beirut in January, and the killing of Ali Al-Debs, along with civilians, a week ago in Nabatiyeh.\nThe airstrike targeted the top floor of a building in a residential neighborhood on the Kafr Rumman-Marjayoun Highway, killing Saleh and one other person, and wounding three people.\nThe Israeli airstrike on the Civil Defense Center of the Islamic Health Authority in Blida on Thursday night led to the destruction of the building, with debris removal continuing until Friday morning.\nHezbollah mourned the three paramedics killed in the strike: Hussein Mohammed Khalil from the town of Baraachit, and Mohammed Yaacoub Ismail and Mohammed Hassan from Blida.\nSocial media videos showing the funeral processions revealed the extent of material devastation to local neighborhoods as a result of Israeli bombardment.\nThe funeral procession was attended by a crowd of Hezbollah supporters.\nA security source monitoring field developments in southern Lebanon said: “Both Hezbollah and the Israeli army possess a dangerous information bank, with advanced tracking technology for the Israeli side.\n“Hezbollah cadre Wissam Al-Tawil was targeted by a drone over a month ago in his town of Kherbet Selem immediately upon his return, and in return, Hezbollah targeted Israeli military positions.”\nHezbollah said: “In response to the attack on the civil defense center in Blida, it targeted, through an aerial attack with two drones, the headquarters of the Regional Council in Kiryat Shmona and accurately hit them.”\nThe southern Lebanese border area came under Israeli attack on Friday morning. The town of Wazzani was targeted by gunfire and artillery, leading to the wounding of a Lebanese soldier and damage to homes and livestock farms.\nWhile Blida mourned the three dead paramedics, the Israeli army opened fire on the town’s cemeteries, where residents were digging graves.\nIsraeli artillery hit the outskirts of Halta Farm, the forests of Kfarchouba, Kfarhamam and Jabal Al-Labouneh, as well as the outskirts of Naqoura on the coast.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Army announced “the conclusion of intensive training for warships equipped with missiles at sea in the north of the country.”\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz informed the UN Security Council presidency that his country “will enforce security on its northern borders militarily if the Lebanese government does not implement Resolution 1701 and prevent attacks from its borders on Israel.”\nKatz’s statement also included unprecedented details about Iran’s transfer of weapons to Hezbollah via Syria, an apparent violation of Resolution 1701.\nHis comments appeared to signal the possibility of Israel launching a full-scale war on Lebanon.\nKatz called on the Security Council to “demand that the government of Lebanon fully implement Resolution 1701 and ensure that the area up to the Litani River is free from military presence, assets or weapons.”\nArtist’s mural in Gaza commemorates ‘buried dreams’ of Palestinian children\n- Calligrapher and photojournalist Bilal Khaled dedicated his artwork to the children of Gaza\nGAZA: A Palestinian calligrapher and photojournalist has left a poignant “message to the world” via a large mural he painted on a building in Rafah, southern Gaza.\nBilal Khaled’s artwork, titled “Buried Dreams,” is dedicated to the children killed in an Israeli strike on the property.\nAt approximately 2.5 meters tall, the mural adorns the crumbling walls of the leveled building.\nHe said: “I needed a mental breather from the genocide atmosphere and the smell of human remains, and at the same time, I wanted to leave a message for the world using the art that fascinates me – Arabic calligraphy.”\nKhaled pointed out that he had included the word ahlam – Arabic for dreams – in the piece to commemorate the dreams of Gaza’s children.\n“At least 13 people died in this building when an explosive barrel was dropped here. Many dreams have been buried under the rubble of this building,” he added.\nSince Oct. 7, when Israel launched its bombing campaign in Gaza in retaliation for a deadly Hamas attack, more than 12,400 Palestinian children have been killed in strikes, according to Gaza health officials.\nMore than 600,000 children are trapped in Rafah on the Egyptian border after having fled with their families from other parts of the embattled Palestinian enclave.\nOn why he called his mural “Buried Dreams,” Khaled said: “These are the simple dreams of (Gaza’s) children, who want to live, have a home, and wear clean clothes. (The children of Gaza) have even lost the right to life.”\nUS ‘disappointed’ by Israeli plans to build 3,000 new housing units in settlements, says Blinken\n- New settlements are counterproductive to reaching an enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians\nBUENOS AIRES: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday he was “disappointed” by an Israeli announcement that it plans to build 3,000 new housing units in settlements in the occupied West Bank.\nBlinken said during a news conference in Buenos Aires that it was long-standing US policy that new settlements are counterproductive to reaching an enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\nTurkiye, Somalia to deepen military bonds after historic deal\n- Ankara needs to ratify deal approved by African nation\n- Turkiye expanding military, economic footprint in Africa, say experts\nAnkara: With Somalia partnering with Turkiye to help build its sea and naval capabilities, questions have now arisen about the potential regional impact of the tie-up, and why Ankara is expanding its military footprint overseas, including seeking a greater presence in the Red Sea.\nSomalia’s cabinet approved on Wednesday the historic defense deal that authorized Turkiye to defend the African nation’s coastline for the next decade, amid tensions with Ethiopia, and mandated it to build a navy for the country.\nTurkiye, whose navy has been operating off Somalia’s shores and in the Gulf of Aden under the UN mission since 2009, will not only build the African country’s navy but also train and equip personnel to counter illegal fishing in the latter’s territorial waters.\nTurkiye has also been training Somalia’s soldiers for a few years in a bid to help the country develop its army.\nAnkara also has its largest overseas military base in Mogadishu, while a Turkish company is operating the airport of the capital city.\n“This agreement will put an end to the fear of terrorism, pirates, illegal fishing, poisoning, abuse and threats from abroad,” Somalia’s Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre was quoted by local press as saying during the cabinet meeting.\n“Somalia will have a true ally, a friend, and a brother in the international arena,” he added.\nAlthough the details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed, Somalia’s press claimed that the deal would give Turkiye 30 percent of the revenues coming from the Somali exclusive economic zone, which is rich in marine resources.\nConsidered a gateway to the continent, Somalia’s 3,025-km coastline is the longest in Africa.\nThe agreement needs to be ratified by Turkiye’s parliament and the president before being finalized.\nHakan Akbas, a senior advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group, said that this pact shows Turkiye’s growing ambition to become a key player in the Horn of Africa, enhancing its ties with Somalia and Ethiopia but excluding some Ethiopian agreements troubling Mogadishu.\n“Turkiye’s recent strategic moves aim to bolster Somalia’s military, promote stability, and protect its interests through security, economic, and humanitarian efforts,” he added.\nAccording to Akbas, this agreement reflects Turkiye’s bold foreign policy and strategy to establish key military and economic partnerships aimed at securing its interests in the region.\n“This gives Somalia a very essential partner in matters of national security, counter-piracy, anti-terrorism, and border protection, including against illegal fishing. It is a win-win for both nations,” he said.\nEarlier this month, Somalia’s Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur signed the framework agreement in Ankara that mandated Turkiye to protect Somalia’s territorial waters.\nFor Rashid Abdi, chief analyst at Sahan Research, a Nairobi-based think tank, the deal gives Turkiye huge leverage to reshape Somalia and the Horn of Africa.\n“Turkish navy will help rebuild Somali navy and will deploy ships to patrol its maritime Economic Protection Zone. Turkiye is now positioned to become Somalia’s top strategic partner,” he told Arab News.\nHowever tensions still remain high in the region especially after Ethiopia and the breakaway Somaliland reached an agreement granting landlocked Addis Ababa access to the Red Sea and ensuring the recognition of Somaliland as an independent state.\nSomaliland is still recognized internationally as part of Somalia although it controversially declared its independence in 1991. The deal had infuriated Somalia which considered it a breach of its territorial sovereignty.\nAs Ankara also has close ties with Ethiopia and provided it with military drones in 2022, how Turkiye will find a balance between the national interests of both countries remains to be seen especially regarding maritime violations.\nAbdi thinks that the agreement will put Turkiye in a tight spot if Ankara seeks to enforce Somali sovereignty in breakaway Somaliland.\n“It will also be viewed as provocative by Ethiopia which wants a military base on the Somaliland coast close to Bab Al-Mandeb,” he said.\n“Turkiye has huge commercial interest in Ethiopia. Turkiye helped Ethiopian premier end the conflict in Tigray. For the time being, Turkiye will be walking a tightrope. It is therefore uncertain how Ankara will balance the competing demands of its two Horn allies — Ethiopia and Somalia. Ethiopia is a big market, home of the African Union and a regional hegemon. Upsetting Ethiopia and countering its regional interests in Somaliland will put Addis Ababa on a confrontation course with Ankara,” he added.\nIn December, the UN Security Council lifted its three-decade arms embargo on Somalia’s government.\n“The latest defense deal with Somalia is anchored in a meticulously crafted intellectual framework spanning a decade,” said international relations professor Serhat Guvenc of Istanbul’s Kadir Has University.\n“Ankara recently announced the provision of a second batch of MILGEM corvettes to the Ukrainian navy. Turkiye’s forthcoming endeavor to assist Somalia in bolstering its naval forces will mark the country’s second significant contribution to a foreign navy,” he added.\nAccording to Guvenc, Turkiye’s strategy in Africa began with bolstering trade and economic ties before seeking to provide military training and high-end Turkish weapons systems.\n“Turkiye recently constructed Istanbul-class frigates for its naval forces exemplifying the country’s expanding maritime prowess extending from Istanbul to the Gulf of Aden without requiring refueling stops,” he said.\nTurkiye also took part in the multinational Combined Task Force 151 to prevent piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden and off the eastern coast of Somalia. Turkiye took command of the task force six times.\n“Turkish Naval Forces have shown a high effectiveness and even in instances where Turkiye didn’t commit ships, its commanders were preferred due to their intimate understanding of regional challenges,” said Guvenc.\nDespite acknowledging the strategic significance of the deal, experts caution that its implementation demands substantial investment and logistical capabilities from Turkiye.\n“In 2014, Turkish Naval Forces started its circumnavigation of Africa and toured the continent twice. But this time, Turkiye needs to double and maybe triple its naval forces for effective outreach across the vast region,” Guvenc said.\n“Overseas bases give countries a significant prestige and put them among countries which have outreach to the remote regions of the world. It is a key indicator for the power hierarchies because it means that the country is able to project strategic power from its naval influence,” he added.\nHowever, Guvenc sees some “political” risks with the deal.\n“Turkiye has traditionally refrained from taking part in intra-African conflicts. It has always taken a standing that was above conflicts. But it remains to be seen to what extent it could safeguard Somali interests by force or whether it would have to be involved in local conflicts. It is also technically difficult to protect the exclusive economic zone of Somalia which intersects with issues like illegal fishing activities and potential clashes with other nations in the region,” he said.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues/index.php) Subscribe now",

    "text": "LIXIL Welcomed Tools & Tiaras Campers for Hands-On Plumbing Workshop\nNEW YORK, NY — LIXIL, a global leader in pioneering water and housing products, continued its ongoing partnership with Tools & Tiaras, hosting a hands-on workshop as part of the organization’s 2025 summer camp.\nHeld at the LIXIL Water Experience Center in New York City, the event introduced young girls to the world of plumbing through interactive, educational activities led by industry professionals. Founded by tradeswoman and advocate Judaline Cassidy, Tools & Tiaras empowers girls ages 6 to 14 to explore careers in construction and the skilled trades through real-world experiences, mentorship, and exposure to role models in the field.\nExpanding Access and Representation\nThe skilled labor shortage in the US—particularly in plumbing—has reached critical levels, with demand for qualified workers far outpacing supply. One contributing factor is the industry’s ongoing lack of diversity. While women make up 47% of the overall U.S. workforce, they represent just 2.1% of plumbers. As experienced workers retire and fewer young people enter the trades, LIXIL and Tools & Tiaras see expanding access and representation as key to addressing this workforce gap.\n“At a time when the skilled labor shortage is escalating, we believe in nurturing curiosity and confidence in the next generation—especially among young women who have traditionally been underrepresented in these fields,” said Nik Bafana, SVP & Leader, LIXIL Americas. “By making these careers more visible and accessible, we can help them see what’s possible—and support them in building futures rooted in purpose, creativity, and skill.”\nHands-On Learning\nFeaturing live product displays and innovative solutions from across LIXIL’s portfolio of leading brands—American Standard, GROHE, DXV, INAX, and Basco—the LIXIL Water Experience Center provided an ideal hands-on learning environment for campers. The workshop also marked a meaningful moment in American Standard’s 150th anniversary year, spotlighting the brand’s legacy of plumbing innovation. One activity brought that history to life by exploring the evolution of toilet technology: campers compared an older model to American Standard’s high-efficiency Champion Pro, complete with a golf ball flush test that demonstrated how far performance and water savings have come.\nIn the Water Experience Center’s working shower area, a “Showerhead Showdown” helped campers understand water pressure and flow. The group also constructed DIY water filters using charcoal and other materials, illustrating the science behind the GROHE Blue Chilled & Sparkling 2.0 Water System. Finally, a plate-painting and cleaning activity allowed campers to playfully try out various working kitchen faucets.\n“Our camps prove that confidence and capability grow through hands-on experience,” said Cassidy. “We’re proud to partner with companies like LIXIL that don’t just support our mission—they open their doors, share their resources, and help reimagine what a future in the trades can look like for girls.”\nAdvancing the Trade\nLIXIL’s collaboration with Tools & Tiaras is part of a broader commitment to advancing the plumbing trade. Through initiatives, such as American Standard’s TradeUp program and GROHE’s GIVE program, LIXIL partners with educators, customers, and local communities to provide students with the training, tools, and inspiration needed to become tomorrow’s skilled professionals.\nTo learn more about LIXIL, visit www.lixil.com.\nTo learn more about Tools & Tiaras, visit www.toolsandtiaras.org.",
