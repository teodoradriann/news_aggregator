    "title": "High-Fructose Corn Syrup Linked to Speedier Tumor Growth",
    "text": "STORY AT-A-GLANCE\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a common sweetener, is produced from cornstarch and contains a higher proportion of fructose than table sugar\nYour liver processes fructose into lipids (fats), which are then used by cancer cells for growth, indirectly fueling tumor development\nResearch showed that inhibiting the liver's ability to process fructose reduced circulating lipids and prevented fructose from promoting tumor growth\nConsuming whole fruits, with their natural fiber and nutrients, is a healthier way to consume fructose than through refined sugars like HFCS\nReducing HFCS intake involves reading food labels, choosing whole foods, and limiting processed foods high in added sugars\nAdvertisement Many everyday foods and drinks contain high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a common sweetener found in countless products. While it adds sweetness, growing research is uncovering a worrying connection between HFCS consumption and the growth of cancerous tumors. Understanding this link is necessary to make informed choices about what you eat and how you protect your health.\nWhat Is High-Fructose Corn Syrup?\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is made from cornstarch, which is broken down into a sugar called glucose. Then, enzymes are used to convert some of that glucose into another sugar called fructose. This process results in a syrup with a mixture of glucose and fructose. HFCS is similar to regular table sugar (sucrose), which is made of equal parts glucose and fructose bonded together.\nHowever, HFCS typically has a slightly higher percentage of fructose. Think of it like this: if starch is a big Lego castle, the production process breaks it down into individual Lego bricks (glucose and fructose) and then reassembles them into a different configuration.\nHFCS is incredibly widespread in our food supply. You'll find it in sodas, fruit juices, processed snacks, baked goods, breakfast cereals, condiments like ketchup and even many yogurts. It's used because it's a cost-effective way to add sweetness and improve the texture of many processed foods. If you walk down any grocery store aisle, you'll likely see HFCS listed on numerous food labels. It's important to be aware of how prevalent it is in the products you consume daily.\nYour body processes HFCS differently than regular table sugar. When you eat glucose, it’s used for energy by almost all cells in your body. Fructose, on the other hand, is mainly processed in your liver. In your liver, fructose is converted into fat, a process called lipogenesis.\nThis is similar to how a car runs on regular gasoline (glucose) that any engine uses. Fructose is more like a specialized fuel that only one type of engine (the liver) processes. If that engine gets too much of this specialized fuel, it starts producing excess byproducts (fat).\nThe consumption of HFCS has increased significantly over the past few decades. This rise has coincided with growing concerns about health problems linked to high refined sugar intake in general. These issues include obesity, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions that increase your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes — and now an increased risk of certain cancers.\nHow HFCS Fuels Tumor Growth\nCancer cells have a unique way of getting energy. They tend to prefer using glucose for energy production through a process called glycolysis, even when oxygen is available. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect . Because HFCS contains a high amount of fructose, which is converted into glucose, it provides cancer cells with more of the fuel they crave.\nIt’s like normal cells are efficient hybrid cars that use both gas and electricity, while cancer cells are like gas-guzzling cars that only run on gas (glucose). HFCS provides them with a bigger supply of that gas. Further, since fructose is primarily processed by your liver, and when there's too much of it, your liver starts producing more fat, this increased fat production leads to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance.\nBoth inflammation and insulin resistance are known risk factors for several types of cancer. A study published in Nature explored this connection, showing how dietary fructose promotes fat buildup in the liver. These fats, specifically lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), are then transported to tumor cells, which use them for growth. 1\nThe liver acts like a factory, and when it’s overloaded with fructose, it creates excess “products” (fats) that cancer cells use as building blocks. This study found that the cancer cells themselves don't readily use fructose as fuel; instead, the liver converts it into these lipids that the cancer cells then use. 2\nExcessive fructose consumption also leads to inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between harmful molecules called free radicals and your body’s ability to counteract them. These factors damage DNA, which is the cell’s instruction manual, and create an environment that's more favorable for tumor growth.\nImagine chronic inflammation as a small, smoldering fire constantly burning inside your body. This fire damages surrounding tissues and increase your risk of problems like cancer. Research is also exploring links between HFCS consumption and specific types of cancer.\nSome studies suggest a connection between high HFCS intake and increased risk or growth of colorectal cancer, for instance. 3 While many of these studies have been conducted in animal models or cell cultures, they raise important questions and highlight the need for more research in humans to fully understand the extent of this connection.\nHow Fructose Fuels Tumors Indirectly\nThe Nature study revealed a surprising mechanism by which fructose promotes tumor growth. The researchers found that fructose doesn't directly fuel cancer cells. Instead, it's your liver that plays a key role. When it processes fructose, it produces lipids, particularly LPCs, which are released into your bloodstream and travel to tumor cells.\nCancer cells need lipids to build their cell membranes, which are essential for growth and division. Instead of making these lipids themselves, many cancer cells prefer to take them up from their environment. The study found that LPCs, produced by the liver in response to fructose, provide an efficient way for cancer cells to get the lipids they need to thrive. It's like your liver is acting as a delivery service, providing essential building blocks to the growing tumor.\nIn the study, researchers discovered that liver cells, unlike the cancer cells they studied, possess the necessary machinery to process fructose. This processing leads to the production and release of LPCs. When these LPCs were administered directly to mice with tumors, it was sufficient to increase tumor growth.\nConversely, when the researchers inhibited the liver's ability to process fructose, it reduced circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose from promoting tumor growth. 4 This demonstrates how your liver acts as an intermediary, transforming fructose into a form that cancer cells readily use. This new understanding of how fructose influences tumor growth could open up new avenues for developing treatments that target the interaction between healthy tissues and cancer cells. 5\nFructose in Whole Foods vs. Refined Sugars\nIt's important to distinguish between fructose consumed in its natural form within whole foods and the isolated fructose found in sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. When fructose is separated from its natural food environment, as in HFCS, it contributes to significant metabolic problems. However, when you eat fructose as part of whole fruit, which also provides fiber, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial plant compounds (phytonutrients), it’s much less of a concern.\nFruits are some of the healthiest foods you can eat. This is because they’re packed with nutrients, and the fiber and phytochemicals they contain help regulate how your body absorbs and processes fructose. These components work together to moderate the impact of fructose on your metabolism. Think of it like this: the fiber in fruit acts like a buffer, slowing down the absorption of fructose into your bloodstream.\nThere’s one main exception when fruit might cause problems: if your gut health is significantly compromised. This happens when the balance of bacteria in your gut (your microbiome) is disrupted, making it difficult for your body to handle the natural fibers in fruit.\nThis imbalance is caused by various factors, such as an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria after beneficial microbes have been diminished by mitochondrial toxins or environmental stressors. The solution isn’t to avoid fruit forever, but rather to work on restoring a healthy gut environment so your body is able to properly digest and benefit from whole, fibrous foods.\nIt’s also worth noting that regular table sugar (sucrose) is half fructose, which is why consuming large amounts of it is metabolically problematic. An alternative like dextrose (pure glucose) is a “safer” carbohydrate choice because glucose doesn’t carry the same risks as isolated fructose. However, it’s important to remember that all carbohydrates, including glucose, should be eaten in moderation.\nWhile carbohydrates are essential for providing energy, eating large amounts of refined carbohydrates too quickly causes spikes in blood sugar and puts stress on your metabolism. In some cases, especially for people with severe food sensitivities or gut problems, slowly sipping a glucose solution throughout the day helps meet carbohydrate needs without causing large insulin responses or gut issues. However, this should be regarded as a short-term solution only.\nFocusing on whole fruits as a source of fructose, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome by restoring mitochondrial function for optimal cellular energy, and being mindful of refined sugars — including avoiding HFCS — is key. This balanced approach supports metabolic health and helps avoid the pitfalls of isolated fructose and the excessive intake of refined carbohydrates.\nHow to Reduce Your HFCS Intake\nOne of the first steps to reducing HFCS intake is to avoid processed foods and become a savvy label reader. HFCS is usually listed clearly in the ingredient list of packaged foods. However, it's also important to be aware of other names that might indicate its presence, such as corn syrup, corn sugar and glucose-fructose syrup. By carefully checking labels, you’ll be able to make more informed choices about what you buy and eat.\nLuckily, there are many healthier alternatives to HFCS. Whole fruits provide natural sweetness along with important vitamins, minerals and fiber. Natural sweeteners like honey and maple syrup are also recommended, but make sure to choose pure varieties — not those with added HFCS.\nIt’s also important to focus on reducing your overall intake of refined sugars . Instead of reaching for a soda, choose water or unsweetened tea. When making sauces or dressings at home, you control the amount and type of sweetener used. Simple swaps like these make a big difference.\nA balanced diet is important for overall health and cancer prevention. Eating plenty of healthy carbohydrates and an appropriate amount of protein provides your body with the nutrients it needs to function properly. It's about creating a healthy foundation that supports your body’s natural defenses. Beyond diet, other lifestyle changes also play a role in cancer prevention.\nRegular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco products and limiting alcohol consumption are all important factors. These choices, combined with a conscious effort to reduce HFCS intake by avoiding processed foods, empower you to take control of your health.\nWhen you eliminate processed foods from your diet, you not only reduce your intake of HFCS but also another compound that’s consumed in excess — linoleic acid (LA), which will further boost your health and reduce cancer risk.\nProtecting Your Health Through Informed Choices\nResearch points to a concerning connection between high-fructose corn syrup and cancer growth. The Nature study revealed that fructose doesn't directly fuel cancer cells but instead works indirectly through your liver, which converts it into lipids that cancer cells readily use for growth.\nWhile more research is needed, it’s clear that making informed dietary choices is essential. By carefully avoiding processed foods, reading food labels, choosing healthier alternatives to HFCS and adopting a balanced lifestyle, you proactively protect your health. Ultimately, this leaves you empowered with knowledge and able to make choices that support your well-being.\nNEXT ARTICLE >>\nDisclaimer : The entire contents of this website are based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola, unless otherwise noted.

At this stage, this court under the facts and circumstances of the case is not inclined to pass any direction. Accordingly, the plea is dismissed. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 23-02-2024 21:42 IST | Created: 23-02-2024 21:34 IST - Country: - India The Delhi High Court on Friday rejected the application seeking permission to offer prayer on Shab E Barat at the site of Akhunji Mosque in Mehrauli. The said 600-year-old Mosque was demolished by the DDA on January 30 and the site is in the possession of the DDA. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav dismissed the plea after hearing the submissions of the parties. The High Court noted that urgency for passing an appropriate order on the instant application is expressed on the ground mentioned in the instant application which primarily, states that an unhindered entry be allowed in the graveyard and site of the Mosque i.e., Masjid Akhunji, of persons wanting to offer night-long prayers and visit at graves, site of departed elders beginning from thirty minutes before sunset on Sunday, on February 25, 2024 and ending thirty minutes after sunrise on Monday, February 26. The High Court said that the petitioner ought to have promptly approached this Court seeking relief to offer prayers on the occasion of the festival, the date of which was already known to all concerned. \"Rather, the petitioner has preferred to apply at such a belated stage, pressing for its urgent disposal without giving an opportunity to file aformal reply,\" the High Court observed. The application was moved by the Management Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board. Permission was sought for locals to enter the site for 30 Minutes on Sunday evening and Monday morning. The petition against the demolition is pending before the High Court and listed on March 7, 2024. The High Court said that admittedly the site in question is in possession of DDA and the High Court is seized of the matter which is listed on March 7. At this stage, this court under the facts and circumstances of the case is not inclined to pass any direction. Accordingly, the plea is dismissed. During the hearing, it was submitted that the mosque was built during the Delhi Sultanate Period 600-700 years ago. Advocate Shams Khwaja appeared for the Management Committee and argued that the people are celebrating Shab E Barat at the site of generations. It was also submitted by the counsel that on Shab E Barat people pay respect to their ancestors who had been buried at the graveyard which had been razed. The Delhi High Court on February 5, directed a status quo on the site after the action by the DDA.

    "text": "Aunque Starfield fue el lanzamiento más importante para Bethesda y Microsoft en 2023, [Hi-Fi RUSH](https://www.levelup.com/Xbox-Series-XS/juegos/722397/HiFi-Rush) fue la sorpresa que emocionó a los fanáticos. Sin duda, el proyecto de Tango llamó la atención gracias a su estreno inesperado, pero parece que las cosas pudieron ser muy diferentes. Al inicio del año pasado, Microsoft realizó un Xbox Developer Direct, evento digital donde mostró los proyectos que iban a debutar en los meses venideros. Los fanáticos pudieron ver nuevos trailers de Minecraft Legends, Forza Motorsports, The Elder Scrolls Online y Redfall. Sin embargo, hubo un anuncio inesperado: Hi-Fi RUSH, un hack and slash muy colorido y carismático desarrollado por Tango Gameworks. Lo interesante fue que se lanzó justo después de la transmisión, por lo que miles de fans pudieron comprarlo o jugarlo a través de Xbox Game Pass el mismo día. Video relacionado: Lo bueno, lo malo y lo meh de Hi-Fi RUSH HI-FI RUSH se iba a revelar en 2020, pero no sucedió por esta razón Sin embargo, el plan original de Tango Gameworks y Bethesda no era realizar un lanzamiento sorpresa. De hecho, el videojuego iba a tener un proceso de marketing más tradicional. En una entrevista con [GamesRadar+](https://www.gamesradar.com/how-hi-fi-rush-came-together-to-deliver-kinectic-action-comedy-inspired-by-edgar-wright-and-shaun-of-the-dead/), John Johanas, director de Hi-Fi RUSH, compartió nuevos detalles sobre la historia detrás del título de acción y ritmo. Allí, reveló que, originalmente, planeaban anunciar el proyecto durante el E3 de 2020. La cancelación del evento y [la compra de Bethesda por parte de Microsoft](https://www.levelup.com/noticias/592207/Microsoft-compra-Bethesda-estudio-de-DOOM-y-The-Elder-Scrolls) obligó al equipo a cambiar de estrategia. “Buscábamos el momento adecuado para anunciarlo para que algo más no lo eclipsara. Queríamos generar expectativas, pero sin emocionar mucho a la gente ni dar demasiada oportunidad para que se lanzaran contra él. Y luego ese periodo se volvió cada vez más corto”, reveló el creativo. Enseguida, el director confiesa que se discutió la idea de hacer un lanzamiento sorpresa en el Developer Direct de 2023. Admite que estaban asustados, pues reconoce que era inaudito que un juego que estuvo en desarrollo durante 5 años se lanzara sin algún tipo de promoción. “Estábamos asustados. ¿Esto va a funcionar? Ya sabes, ¿qué pasa si algo sucede ese día? Pero creo que todo salió tan bien como cualquiera podría imaginar. Quiero decir, me alegré de que la gente lo disfrutara, ¿sabes? Pero te hace pensar: ¿pudo ser diferente si lo hubiéramos anunciado antes? Supongo que nunca lo sabremos”, comentó John Johanas. En la entrevista, el director de Hi-Fi RUSH confiesa que, al principio, pensó que su idea de un juego rítmico sería rechazada debido a que el concepto se aleja del terror. Tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar en un prototipo que rápidamente ganó adeptos dentro de la compañía. “Probablemente la razón por la que pudimos hacerlo fue porque la gente de Bethesda estaba entusiasmada por hacer algo nuevo y diferente. Y ya era divertido, que era lo más importante”, comentó John Johanas. Pero cuéntanos, ¿crees que el lanzamiento sorpresa jugó a favor del juego? Déjanos leerte en los comentarios.

En concreto, el Gobierno logró embolsar $ 42.981.821 millones, registrando una caída real de en torno al 8,2%.\nEn el año que terminó, los ingresos públicos crecieron por debajo de la inflación y casi ningún tributo se salvó de la debacle.\nLa excepción fue el impuesto PAIS, el que creó Alberto Fernández en el arranque de su presidencia para encarecer el acceso al dólar . A lo largo de cuatro años, este impuesto fue ganando peso y se fue extendiendo a otras operaciones.\nEsto llevó a que en el cierre de 2023, el impuesto PAIS registrara una suba de 861,4%, lo que implica un aumento real de 202,9%. La consultora ACM señala que \"esto es producto de la ampliación de la base imponible luego de las nuevas disposiciones tributarias del gobierno a fines de julio de ese año\".\n\"Este impuesto comenzó a tomar cada vez más relevancia para el fisco a la hora de la recaudación. Durante el 2022, el Impuesto PAIS representó el 0,4% del PBI mientras que para el 2023, ese porcentaje habría subido al 0,8%, pasando a duplicar su recaudación en un año \", detalla ACM.",
