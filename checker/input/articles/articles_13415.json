    "text": "Scale Your Cleaning Company With The Leading Cleaning Services App\nOperation of a cleaning business is quite a complex thing, and the idea of a special cleaning scheduling app was in the air for a while. This app’s goal is to keep order in the workflow and provide business owners with a transparent and simple tool for management, payroll, and communication with the staff. Shifton gathered all these needs and problems and embodied their solution in\nscheduling software for cleaning service which you can use right now. Let’s consider what to do with it and which issues can be solved with its help.\nWhat problems does the cleaning planning application solve?\nThe essence of a cleaning business is maintaining strict order and cleanness both in its customers’ premises and in the workflow.

The results are often upsetting: an owner loses money, employees do not get proper rewards and strict scheduling, and thus, they can lose motivation and work through their sleeves.\nWhat problems can be mitigated by applying\nscheduling software for cleaning service then?\n- Lack of automation in paperwork. You can automate daily checklists, reports, and forms, create them in the software and offer your employees to fill them in instantly.\n- Working hours have bad tracking. When your staff is in the field, you can hardly gather relevant info about who and where is working right now. Using a cleaning scheduling app like Shifton with built-in GPS, you can accurately track hours of work for each worker.\n- Developing a schedule when you have dozens of workers and teams is hard. When you automate it, you can easily assign shifts and service calls and flexibly manage them when needed.\n- Staying in touch with all your staff when they are not office workers is also troublesome. You can enhance internal communication by providing your employees with access to a cleaning scheduling app. In Shifton, you can send notifications and messages, exchange reports and get checklists with your employees without calling them or meeting them.\n- In cleaning companies, HR departments also face multiple challenges. A cleaning services scheduling software is a helper for HRs which streamlines human resource needs including working hours and sick days accounting, payroll, rewards and penalties, and hiring and firing processes.\nIf these problems are familiar to you, probably, it’s time to try cleaning services scheduling software to diminish them.\nHow Automation Helps Cleaning Managers Tackle Workplace Challenges\nBesides being useful for a business owner or a CEO, scheduling software for cleaning services is also a great tool for cleaning managers working for them.\nAutomate Daily Checklists, Reports, and Forms\nDay-to-day operations are a core function of efficiently running your cleaning company, therefore checklists and reports are commonly used in order to lessen friction from day-to-day activities, automate information flow, enhance response time, and build oversight.

Making employee cleaning schedule becomes a seamless process with Shifton as with it, you can:\n- Assign cleaners for services according to various requirements and tasks.\n- Provide all relevant information including time, address, and special instructions for each location and customer to your employees.\n- Send reminders and notifications to ensure cleaners arrive on time, and also to notify the manager if someone is running late or if any emergent situation occurs.\n- Keep records of the clock-in and clock-out time and location, and enable shift notes and comments when additional information is needed to maintain streamlined communication with the staff.\n- Know when employees clock in and complete a shift and get maximum information about the completion of tasks in the form of photos and comments attached to the app.\n- Allow employees to accept or reject shifts, apply for weekdays and sick days when needed, and manage employee cleaning schedule easily.\nBesides enhanced functionality, scheduling software for cleaning services offers more benefits to a manager or an owner of a cleaning company.\n- Instant access from anywhere.\n- Cloud storage for all data you operate.\n- Easy adjustment and development of document templates like checklists and reports, which can be submitted by employees instantly from their mobile devices or laptops.\n- Digital accounting of cleaning tools and detergents to supply them to the staff timely.\n- Momentary synchronization of all information and keeping it in one place with multi-level access for you and your staff.\nSet up automated procedures for repetitive or important workflows\nWhen you have repetitive procedures in your workflow, with the help of scheduling software for cleaning services, you can automate them to save time and cost and not miss anything.\n- Create automated checklists.\n- Create workflows for specific permits and approval processes.\n- Send instant notifications to ensure nothing gets missed and reduce avoidable delays.\nAllow a flexible schedule\nFor your workers, an opportunity to get weekends and sick days online is priceless. It shows that you take care of them. With scheduling software for cleaning service, you can exchange shifts and provide changes instantly when you need it, even on the go or when your cleaner informs you about being sick late at night.\nGenerate cleaning reports in a single click\nEach business requires relevant reporting for development and scaling up.

    "text": "Buffalo Bills flag brightens some spirits in Ovid after a devastating fire\nWith all of the problems that people in the Seneca County village of Ovid are dealing with after Tuesday’s massive fire, love for a football team is helping lift some spirits.\nThat fire destroyed several businesses and apartments on the village’s main street, including the Italian Kitchen Restaurant. But owner Ron Carmona has been sharing a photo taken of one of the three Buffalo Bills flags that were on poles outside the rubble where his restaurant student. The pole it was on is bent low, the flag has a lot of ice and frost on it, but the red, white and blue of the Bills logo is clearly visible.\nAnd Carmona said that has brightened the day just a bit for many people in that community.\n“Absolutely, absolutely, everybody stopped, taking pictures of the flag, with the flag and all that because, it is our team, for most people, we root for them all the time,” Carmona said.\nCarmona is not sure he’ll have the money needed to rebuild, and Ovid Town Supervisor Joe Borst told WXXI News that’s the case with other business owners as well.\n“Everybody’s still in so much shock right now,” said Borst. “Obviously, it’s the main street of the town, it’s the business district. The hopes are we can rebuild something there, work with whoever we need to work with.”\nBoth Carmona and Borst say whatever happens, they are heartened by the unity and support they’ve seen in the Ovid community, in the wake of the fire’s destruction.",
