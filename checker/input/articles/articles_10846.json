    "title": "Australia to Ban Teens from Tiktok, Instagram, X, Snapchat",
    "text": "Australia is rushing to get a new law banning children under 16 from using most social media platforms through parliament.\nOn Thursday, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland listed some of the platforms that children would be banned from, including TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, X, and perhaps most controversially Snapchat, which is extremely popular with Australian youth.\nThe Snapchat ban was first reported by Australia’s News.com, which quoted Rowland last week saying Snapchat might evade the new age restrictions because it was arguably a messaging platform, not a social media service. WhatsApp has been exempted from the ban on similar grounds.\nSome Australians who support the ban said it was important to block access to Snapchat, which they described as one of the worst platforms for negatively influencing young people.\n“For many Australian families, Snapchat has had a devastating impact on their children. The idea of having social media age limits without those limits applying to Snapchat is outrageous,” Shadow Communications Minister David Coleman said after Rowland suggested Snapchat might be exempted.\n“Not everyone on Snapchat is an online bully, but in my experience every online bully uses Snapchat. It’s just such a great tool to weaponize harm,” said Queensland Catholic Secondary Principals Association Director Dan McMahon.\nMcMahon said he was “gobsmacked” that Snapchat might be left off the ban list because several of his students have been killed by online bullying conducted through the platform. His gob is now presumably unsmacked, because Rowland said Snapchat will be blocked when the new system takes effect next year.\nNews.com suspected Australian teens will not take this news well because they are very fond of Snapchat and they might question the logic of banning it while permitting access to services like YouTube and Google, which are evading the restrictions because they are used in classrooms.\nThe ban also makes exceptions for video game platforms, which will come as a relief to children but many concerned adults point to video game platforms like Minecraft and Roblox as some of the most dangerous social media platforms of all. Canadian police recently warned that extremists like the Islamic State are heavily recruiting young people with the social media functions of online games.\nAustralia has been boasting of its “world-leading” plans to restrict social media for children since November, when a timetable for both legislation and implementation was announced. Some other national and local governments, including in the United States, have made efforts to restrict social media usage for children, but the cutoff age is usually much younger than Australia’s proposed 16.\nMost other social media restriction schemes also include “grandfather” clauses that will allow children under the cutoff age to continue using their existing accounts when the ban goes into effect. This is not the case with Australia, which plans to simultaneously shut down all existing accounts for children on the affected social media platforms next year.\nRowland and her boss, Prime Minister Antony Albanese, admit that the logistics of implementing and enforcing the ban are still being worked out. Albanese remained adamant that the ban is necessary, and will be implemented on schedule next year.\n“We know social media is doing social harm,” Albanese said in a statement on Thursday. “We want Australian children to have a childhood, and we want parents to know the Government is in their corner.”\n“This is a landmark reform. We know some kids will find workarounds, but we’re sending a message to social media companies to clean up their act,” he added.\n“If it was easy it would have been done around the world. But just because something is hard doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try,” the prime minister said.\nRowland said one of the enforcement mechanisms will be fines of up to $49.5 million for “online safety breaches” from social media companies.\n“The legislation places the onus on social media platforms, not parents or children, to ensure protections are in place. Ultimately, this is about supporting a safer and healthier online environment for young Australians,” Rowland said.\nThe bill introduced in the Australian parliament on Thursday provides for developing an age verification system that could use biometrics or government-issued identification cards. There is little serious opposition to the bill, although a few lawmakers have asked for more details about how the system will work, or expressed skepticism that determined young people can be effectively banned from social media.\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission lodged one of the sternest objections to the bill on Thursday, expressing “serious reservations” about the “potential for these laws to significantly interfere with the rights of children and young people.”\n“Where rights are limited to protect children from online harms, any limitations must be lawful, necessary and proportionate. This means using the least restrictive option available to achieve the intended purpose,” the commission said.\nThe commission cited various international conventions on children’s rights that could be transgressed by the ban, warned that it could interfere with educational activities, and expressed concern that the age verification system could compromise the privacy rights of all Australians.\n“Social media is integral to modern communication and socialization. Excluding young people from these platforms may isolate them from their peers and limit their ability to access much-needed information and support. This is particularly important for young people from marginalized, vulnerable or remote communities,” the commission said.\nAsia National Security Tech Anthony Albanese Australia Censorship Children Instagram Internet freedom Reddit Snapchat Social Media TikTok Twitter",

    "text": "Загрузка предыдущей публикации...\nЗагрузка предыдущих новостей...\nКак первоначально сообщило агентство Bloomberg, компания Tesla расформировывает команду, работавшую над Dojo – внутренним суперкомпьютером для обучения искусственного интеллекта, и перераспределяет оставшихся сотрудников на другие проекты внутри компании.\nЭто знаменует собой изменение в стратегии компании по поиску вычислительных ресурсов для инициатив, ориентированных на искусственный интеллект, таких как автономное вождение и робот Optimus.\nГлава Dojo Питер Бэннон (Peter Bannon) покидает Tesla, что является последним уходом после того, как около 20 членов команды Dojo недавно ушли, чтобы основать DensityAI.\nВ ответ на сообщение Bloomberg в социальной сети X генеральный директор Tesla Илон Маск (Elon Musk) заявил: «Не имеет смысла для Tesla разделять свои ресурсы и масштабировать два совершенно разных дизайна чипов искусственного интеллекта. Чипы Tesla AI5, AI6 и последующие будут превосходными для логического вывода и, по крайней мере, довольно хорошими для обучения. Все усилия сосредоточены на этом».\nМаск имеет в виду чип Tesla следующего поколения AI6, который будет производиться компанией Samsung в рамках сделки на 16,5 миллиарда долларов. Эти чипы будут обеспечивать принятие решений в режиме реального времени на борту автомобилей и роботов Tesla.\nЗакрытие проекта Dojo фактически ставит крест на амбициозной долгосрочной цели Tesla по созданию собственной внутренней архитектуры обучения и консолидирует усилия компании на платформах AI5 и AI6.\nХотя Маск утверждает, что эти чипы \"достаточно хороши\" для обучения, компания теперь будет сильно полагаться на таких поставщиков, как NVIDIA, в отношении специализированного кремния для обучения, и тратит миллиарды долларов на эти чипы.\nНачало производства AI5 запланировано на 2026 год, за которым последует AI6. Как и другие крупные технологические компании, компании Маска переживают бум в области искусственного интеллекта: чат-бот Grok от xAI теперь доступен в автомобилях Tesla. Компания также испытывает свой парк Robotaxi с неоднозначными результатами.\nЗагрузка предыдущей публикации...\nЗагрузка следующей публикации...\nЗагрузка предыдущих новостей...\nЗагрузка следующих новостей...",

    "text": "Janel Grant, a former WWE employee, has recently come into the spotlight after filing a lawsuit against WWE and its former CEO, Vince McMahon. Grant’s lawsuit alleges serious charges of sexual assault, trafficking, and emotional abuse. The lawsuit, filed in a Connecticut federal court, seeks to void a nondisclosure agreement reportedly made with McMahon in 2022, where he agreed to pay Grant $3 million, of which only $1 million was paid.\nJanel Grant Accuses Vince McMahon of Sex Trafficking\nGrant’s tenure at WWE headquarters in Connecticut began in June 2019. Her allegations include being forced into an affair with a\n[WWE](/wwe) and [UFC](/ufc) “superstar,” (rumored to be Brock Lesnar) and other men, as directed by McMahon.\nThe lawsuit details a particularly disturbing incident on June 23, 2021, where McMahon allegedly locked Grant in his private locker room and assaulted her over a massage table. It also claims that McMahon’s misconduct was known within WWE but was systematically buried. Several vulgar texts are also provided in the lawsuit where McMahon allegedly talks about some of his fantasies.\nTHREAD 1/2 (TW):\nScreenshots of Vince McMahon’s messages from the new sex trafficking lawsuit:\n[pic.twitter.com/pqx78GHSwU]\n— Wrestle Ops (@WrestleOps)\n[January 25, 2024]\nThe case brings to light the darker side of the wrestling entertainment industry, exposing a culture where such serious allegations could be covered up. Grant, through her lawsuit, is challenging not only McMahon but also the organizational structures that might have enabled such behaviors. Grant’s move is seen as a brave step in holding powerful figures accountable.\nMcMahon in Several Lawsuits\nGrant’s case is one of several involving McMahon, where women have reportedly received payouts over the years. Grant was owed $3 million by McMahon from a previous settlement. However, Grant claims that McMahon paid just $1 million and refused to pay the remainder.\nHer action stands as a significant moment in the wrestling world, potentially paving the way for more transparency and accountability in the industry.\nThis lawsuit not only challenges a high-profile individual but also puts a spotlight on the corporate responsibility of organizations like WWE in dealing with such allegations.",

    "text": "The number of young people out of work due to long-term sickness has doubled since 2010, figures show. The Tories are “writing off” young people, Labour has said, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term sickness” doubling since 2010. Sir Keir Starmer’s party said that in 2010/11, there were 116,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work or not looking for employment due to long-term sickness. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for the whole of the UK now puts this number at 235,000 people out of work, the party said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: “By neglecting the foundations needed for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.” The Labour MP said her party would ensure young people do not fall between the cracks between services and Government departments. It hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers’ rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity. Ms Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis facing so many of our young people. “We will transform mental health services, drive down NHS waiting lists, boost skills, bolster employment rights and provide tailored job support.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both sought to get people of all ages back into the workplace, in a bid to boost labour supply across the UK. The proportion of people out of work rose since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the issue is also seen to be caused by a broader set of factors including rising disability and long-term sickness levels. A Government spokesperson said: “We are driving down inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of youth unemployment falling by 43% since 2010. “We are investing £2.3 billion into mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education and apprenticeships. “More widely our Back to Work Plan will help up to 1.1 million people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or long-term unemployed to look for and stay in work.” A Conservative spokesman accused Labour of having a “brass neck”, saying the party had “never left office with unemployment lower than what they inherited”.",

    "text": "Current conditions at Stubai Glacier. | Image: @puschokandbear On Wednesday, December 11, a 27-year-old local skier was caught in an avalanche at the Stubai Glacier, Austria. The 27-year-old was skiing with a 33-year-old Canadian near the “Wildspitz” mountain station. The pair left the groomed runs and skied eastward into steeper off-piste terrain, where they triggered a loose snow avalanche.\nThe avalanche knocked the Austrian skier off his feet and swept him about 40-50 meters (130-165 feet) down the valley. The Canadian skier managed to avoid the avalanche, skied down to his injured friend, and alerted rescue services. While the Austrian skier was not buried, he had sustained unspecified injuries to his left leg that required an evacuation by helicopter. The 27-year old freerider was taken to nearby hospital.\nCurrent conditions at Stubai Glacier. | Image: @puschokandbear The Stubai Glacier is Austria’s largest glacier skiing area and is known for its excellent freeride terrain, with 14 dedicated freeride runs and an off-piste map. The groomed run from the top at Wildspitz at 3,210 meters down to the base at Mutterberg 1,750 meters is a staggering 10 km (6.25 miles) and provides a nice thigh burner. The avalanche occurred in an off-piste area of the resort. Stubai has seen 15 inches of snow in the last five days.\nStubai Glacier ski resort. | Image: Stubai",

    "text": "When conflicts arise in a romantic relationship, we often focus on our partner’s emotions and how to make them feel better.\nHowever, being more forgiving of your own shortcomings is beneficial not just for you, but for your significant other, too. A new study highlights the importance of self-compassion.\nSelf-compassion leads to a happy relationship\nIt’s easy to fall into a gloomy spell when fighting with your partner. You are hard on yourself while blaming them for intentionally or unintentionally contributing to the issue.\nBut, approaching problems differently, with a little more compassion and love for yourself, can strengthen your [relationship](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/relationships/).\nA new study conducted by Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg found that heterosexual couples have better chances of being in a happy relationship when women are self-compassionate.\n- DON’T IGNORE:\n[Simple test to spot warning sign early on in the relationships, from a ‘diagnosed narcissist’](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/simple-test-to-spot-warning-sign-early-on-in-the-relationship-from-a-diagnosed-narcissist/)\n“We found that one’s ability to react compassionately to one’s own inadequacies, suffering, and pain in the relationship benefits both members of the couple. In this way, an actor’s self-compassion not only improves their own happiness but also their partner’s,” the study says.\nThe researchers encourage couples to ask themselves “How would I behave towards a boyfriend or girlfriend if he or she were in such a situation?” and apply the same to take care of themself.\nThey believe the findings of the study can be especially beneficial in couples therapy as self-compassion can be trained.\nHappy relationship leads to better health\nA different study led by researchers from the University of California, Davis, discovered that [happy couples experience fewer health issues](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/being-happy-in-your-relationship-can-lead-to-better-health-when-you-grow-older-says-study/).\nFeeling positive about your romantic relationship can act like a “social resource”, which is crucial for overall well-being.\nThe study says our bodies produce less stress hormones when our partners show positive emotions than usual.\nTherefore, healthy relationships provide an “ideal source of support”, especially important in old age when the ability to deal with stress naturally reduces. However, no link was established between stress and the partner’s negative reactions.\nThe observation made by the study holds true in real life, as one couple married for 69 years agrees that the [secret to staying together](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/couple-married-for-69-years-share-their-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-relationship/) is “never fighting.”",

    "text": "/ world today news/ Mihail Mikov before the session of the National Assembly of the BSP:\nWe are giving artificial respiration to the ABV, the election of Radev is predetermined, before we had a “social president” (ed. Georgi Parvanov), now we will have “military men”!\nI understand that we are looking at the final text, I understand that any party, including ours, going to the presidential elections, must have a platform, but I am very afraid that it may be doing so at a late time. I understand that we are finalizing the text, but I want to correct a few general errors in two directions. The first is somewhat procedural in nature, and I will ask a few rhetorical questions.\nOn what basis and with what mandate the leadership it’s the party’s led negotiations with other political forces without having a platform? As I said, the question is rhetorical. As a result of this gross political error, the impression was created that management is looking for the person to unite unclear who not realizing that Diogenes was already looking for the man 2000 years ago.\nWe need to see what we unite around and then look for the person who will best protect us! And not vice versa.\nAnd one last rhetorical question. Today we have to choose a candidate who will represent our party in the presidential elections. However, how will this candidate protect this platform which we are voting on now, and he will not have the opportunity to familiarize himself with its final text? And what commitment will he make to the National Assembly?\nIn essence, my remarks on the platform are also procedural in nature. We recently held a convention. At this congress we adopted a very good document, at least according to many delegates and party members, and according to me. It is about “Political platform of BSP”. And here I will allow myself a piece of advice for the young, because I am quite old now. When there are voted documents – they must be implemented! And not only to change the chairman of the party!\nAnd I don’t see the direct connection between this vote right now and the documents we voted on before.\nI also suggest that the group that will process the text in its final version should unite around the political platform voted on at the congress and shorten it to the parts that concern the institution of the presidency.\nAnd in conclusion, I want to say that all the “black” texts, the bolt ones I mean, sound like, in fact, any political force can easily stand behind them.\nThank you.\n#Mikhail #Mikov #artificial #respiration #ABV #Radevs #choice #predetermined",

    "text": "I received news a few days ago that former LG Twins manager Lee Kwang-hwan's health was critical, and on the morning of the 2nd, I heard the sad news that he passed away.The deceased was a talent in Korean baseball and a top scholar, and was a junior who played on the field alongside his contemporaries, with whom he had a deep connection. Although there was not much personal interaction, I was close to Manager Kang Byung-cheol and was able to get closer to him through Kang.In my opinion, the deceased was an incredibly ambitious friend with big dreams. Hailing from Daegu, he transferred to Seoul Central High School in the first year of high school in 1964. The following year, he won his first championship at the prestigious Golden Lion High School tournament hosted by the Dong-A Ilbo.The 'Korean Baseball Encyclopedia,' compiled with great dedication by veteran baseball journalist Hong Soon-il, includes over 8,000 baseball figures, journalists, players, and others. The encyclopedia fully introduces the deceased's illustrious career in baseball.During his time as a player at Seoul Central High School, he proved to be the top star of high school baseball by winning the Lee Young-min batting award, and after his retirement from Korea University and the Hanil Bank baseball club, he began his coaching career as the head coach of his alma mater, Seoul Central High School.When professional baseball launched in 1982, the deceased joined the OB Bears as a coach and assisted Manager Kim Young-duk in leading the team to become the first champions of the Korea Professional Baseball League.After successfully transforming into a professional baseball manager, he was appointed as a manager following his role as coach, succeeding Kim Young-duk and Kim Sung-keun, and served as the manager of LG, Doosan, Hanwha, and Heroes, establishing himself as a distinguished manager.At times, he faced humiliation by resigning prematurely due to conflicts with the coaching staff and poor performance, but in 1994, he won the Korean Series with the LG Twins while bringing forth 'exciting baseball' and received the Manager of the Year award (Sports Seoul), continuing his remarkable journey.The reason I hold the deceased in high regard and refer to him as an ambitious leader is that he was the most diligent scholar among baseball coaches.Typically, when a current coach's season ends or their contract is terminated mid-season, it is common to stay in the country and seek the next position, but he traveled abroad each time to learn advanced baseball. His training included studies with major league clubs in Japan and the United States.He deeply analyzed the weak points and issues of new Korean professional baseball in comparison with Japan's top team, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Major League Baseball clubs, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals.In particular, he meticulously clarified the division of duties for pitchers during mound operations, adopting what is known as a star system to thoroughly protect pitchers and heighten the focus in games, laying a substantial foundation for enhancing the team's overall performance.The late Sports Seoul reporter Lee Jong-nam took the lead in spreading the deceased's baseball philosophy through a special human relationship, which is referred to as autonomous baseball. At that time, it was not easy for players, who were accustomed to passive training based on the coach's unilateral directives, to shift to a self-researching approach.In fact, objectively, many baseball professionals said that the original of autonomous baseball was Kim Eung-ryong, coach of the Haitai Tigers. Coach Kim also learned from American baseball before the launch of professional baseball and conveyed to the domestic scene the preparations that the coaching staff should first make to ensure players could practice without discomfort. The usually taciturn Coach Kim rigorously encouraged players to take initiative.Regardless, the deceased was exposed to diverse domestic and international baseball and was frequently interested in the external development of baseball, taking action above all. In 1995, he opened Korea's first baseball museum in Seogwipo, Jeju, which had no particular affiliation and was merely a baseball wasteland at the time, using his own funds. This was an initiative realized based on insights gained during his training in Major League Baseball.He also showed interest in women's baseball, partnering with Jeong Jin-goo, president of the Korean Women's Baseball Association, to significantly enhance its level. His volunteer work for over ten years without compensation to help the baseball team at Seoul National University is also memorable.Even after stepping down as a professional baseball coach, his passion did not wane. He continuously worked at the forefront of baseball development by acting as the chairperson of the KBO Youth Development Committee and supplying T-ball to primary and secondary school educators to expand the base for youth baseball.Above all, I will never forget his deep involvement in the establishment of the 'Baseball Academy' created by the Korea Baseball Organization (Korea Baseball Organization (KBO)), the Korea Baseball Association (Kang Seung-kyu, president), and Seoul National University (Lee Jang-woo, president) for the development of baseball and the sports industry through industry-academic cooperation and joint research.In the realm of protecting baseball development and players' rights, I, who played a role in launching the Ilgu Meeting comprised of 27 baseball veterans, mid-level journalists, current coaches, and commentators, recall fondly that the deceased wished to work as the secretary when I was elected as the 8th and 9th president, creating a team to exchange diverse opinions. As a cheerful man and a good friend with senior and junior relationships, I believe that the Ilgu Meeting laid a strong foundation for its development to this day.The deceased, who was active in various fields such as broadcasting commentary and writing newspaper columns, had a keen insight, particularly after studying with the St. Louis Cardinals, in implementing the star system that precisely subdivided pitchers' roles, which accounted for over 70% of game outcomes. He effectively broke down the roles of pitchers that had been previously classified as starters and finishers, which greatly assisted in protecting pitchers, and that is why I evaluate him as the most significant contributor to the advancement of professional baseball.While it is said that he had a strong will and was stubborn, he did have disputes with those around him due to continuous debates on baseball issues. However, it is undeniable that he instilled a culture among not only managers but also players that they needed to study. His achievement in changing the team colors of the LG Twins and leading them to become the champions of the Korean Series in 1994 was also based on such foundations.I hope he meets his beloved baseball evangelist Lee Jong-nam and reporter Cheon Il-pyeong in heaven and enjoys watching Korean baseball with peace of mind. I pray for the deceased's soul.July 3, 2025. Kim So-sik (former president of the Ilgu Meeting)[OSEN]",
