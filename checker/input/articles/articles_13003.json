    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Shropshire Star",
    "text": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war Traditional celebrations have been halted at the birthplace of Christ. Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",

Печальную новость сообщили в социальных сетях его бывшие коллеги по группе.\nШим Джэхен. Фото: социальные сети Шим Джэхен стал частью F.ABLE в 2020 году. Группа, состоявшая из пяти участников, выпустила ряд популярных песен и успешно гастролировала. В 2023 году группа внезапно прекратила свою деятельность, не объяснив причины своего распада.\nВпоследствии трое из бывших участников F.ABLE продолжили музыкальную карьеру, сформировав новую группу под названием ENPHAZE.\nШим Джэхен не раскрывал информацию о своей болезни и лечении. Он никогда не говорил о своем состоянии здоровья публично, поэтому его кончина стала неожиданностью для многих поклонников.\nНапомним, в феврале скончалась звезда дорам Ким Сэ-рон. Ее экс-возлюбленного Ким Су-хена родственники сочли косвенно виновным в гибели девушки. Из-за скандальных обвинений в адрес звезды пострадала его карьера. К примеру, премьера сериала Knock Off с его участием была перенесена на не определенный срок.",

    "text": "Boeing shares suffered the biggest fall of the Dow Jones index on Wall Street on Friday, as the American machinists' union IAM launched a major strike overnight.\nAfter a 94.6% vote rejecting the new contract proposed by the aircraft manufacturer, and a 96% vote approving the principle of a walkout, the 30,000 members of the IAM 751 union decided to stop work.\nFor analysts, this industrial action makes Boeing's ability to make up for the delays accumulated in recent months due to the emergence of quality and safety problems within its manufacturing chain uncertain.\n'The ball is now in Boeing's court, as it will have to find an answer, resolve the situation and avoid further disruptions', say Bank of America teams.\nThe aeronautics group's management team has declared its readiness to return to the negotiating table to reach an agreement, while emphasizing the advantages linked - in its view - to the new collective agreement.\nIn a research note, Jefferies analysts recall that a similar strike, voted in 2008, lasted 58 days, resulting in delayed deliveries of over 100 aircraft.\nIn financial terms, the research firm recalls, the company had to absorb a $1.2 billion impact on net income and a $2.55 billion impact on cash flow.\nAt around 10:50 a.m. (New York time), Boeing shares were down 0.7%, while the Dow was up 0.7% at the same time.\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.

    "text": "OpenAI⁢ envisions a future​ where online⁣ learning is enhanced by the power of artificial intelligence,wiht chatbots playing a key role in personalized education.\nSiya Raj Purohit, a member of OpenAI’s go-to-market team for education, shared this vision during a recent fireside chat hosted by Coeus collective. Purohit suggested that OpenAI might develop tools allowing e-learning instructors⁢ to create ⁢customized “GPTs” tailored to their specific online curriculums.\n“What I’m hoping is going to happen is that professors are going to ⁣create custom GPTs for the public and let people engage with content in a lifelong manner,” Purohit said. “It’s not part of the ⁤current work that we’re doing, but it’s definitely on the roadmap.”\nPurohit‍ noted that she has already observed professors utilizing OpenAI’s existing tools to ‍upload an entire semester’s worth of ​content and create​ custom GPTs for their⁣ students. ⁤”Students engage‍ with that finite knowledge … [which] I⁣ think is a really powerful‍ and good way to let them ‍research,” she added.\nOpenAI’s ‌Siya Raj Purohit (right), being interviewed by Coeus Collective CEO antonio DiMeglio (left) at Pace University ‌in NYC. Image Credits: Coeus Collective OpenAI is actively pursuing the education market, recognizing its immense potential⁢ for growth. In September,the company appointed Leah Belsky,former chief⁣ revenue officer of Coursera,as‍ its frist education GM,tasking her with​ expanding OpenAI’s presence in schools. Earlier this year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT ⁢Edu, a version of ‌ChatGPT specifically⁤ designed for universities.\nMarket‌ research indicates a promising future for AI in education. ​Allied Market Research predicts the market could⁣ reach a staggering $88.2 billion globally by 2032. However, the initial growth has been somewhat ⁣slow, partly due to reservations among educators.\nThe ​world of education ‌is ⁣on the cusp of a technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) poised⁤ to transform⁢ the way students learn. While the potential benefits are vast, concerns remain about​ the readiness ‌of AI for widespread classroom adoption.\nImagine⁤ a personalized ⁤learning companion, capable of⁢ providing tailored guidance and support to each student. This is the vision driving the ⁣development of “GPTs” – generative pre-trained transformers – designed specifically for educational purposes. These⁣ AI-powered tools could offer students assistance ‌with homework, test preparation, and even provide insights into ⁣complex concepts.\nKhanmigo, a chatbot developed by the e-learning platform Khan Academy in collaboration with OpenAI, offers a glimpse into‍ this future. Integrated with Khan Academy’s vast library of educational content, Khanmigo can provide students with personalized‍ support ‌and guidance. However,as⁢ with any emerging technology,there are challenges to overcome.\nWhen tested by The Wall Street‍ Journal earlier this year,​ Khanmigo‍ demonstrated some limitations. The ⁢chatbot struggled with basic math problems and sometimes failed to ⁣correct errors when asked to double-check ⁢its solutions.\n“All of our models keep getting better, ⁤and​ our goal is to help translate that into what works ​in learning and teaching,”\nDespite these early⁤ hurdles, developers remain ⁣optimistic about⁤ the future of AI in education. Priya⁤ Purohit, a‌ researcher at Google DeepMind, emphasizes the continuous advancement of these models.\nHowever, educators remain cautious. A recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that a⁣ quarter of public K-12 teachers believe AI tools do more harm than good⁢ in the classroom. Similarly, a poll conducted by the Rand Corporation and the Center ⁣on Reinventing Public Education found that ​only 18% of K-12 educators are currently using AI in their teaching.\nThe debate surrounding AI in education is complex, with ⁤valid⁣ concerns on both sides. As technology continues to evolve, it will be crucial to ​carefully consider the ethical implications ⁢and ensure that AI tools are used responsibly ⁢to enhance, rather than replace, the vital role of human ​educators.\n## World ‌Today ⁤News: Exclusive Interview with ⁤OpenAI on the​ Future of⁣ Online Learning\n**By ⁤ [Your Name], Senior Editor**\n**San Francisco, ​CA -** ⁢ The landscape of‍ online ⁢education is poised for a significant conversion as artificial intelligence takes center stage.OpenAI, ⁣a leading force in the field, envisions a future ‌where⁤ chatbots act as ⁣personalized learning ‍companions, ⁤revolutionizing how students interact with educational ⁢content.\n**Siya Raj Purohit**, a member of OpenAI’s ⁣go-to-market‌ team for education, recently⁢ shared this compelling ⁣vision during⁣ a ‍fireside chat hosted by Coeus Collective at Pace University in New York City. Purohit envisions a future where ⁣e-learning instructors can⁤ create customized “GPTs” tailored to⁢ their specific⁣ online curriculums, ⁢leveraging the power ​of openai’s groundbreaking language models.\n“[I’m hoping] that professors ⁤are ​going to create custom GPTs​ for the public and let peopel engage with content in a lifelong manner,” Purohit stated. “it’s ‌not part of the current ‍work that ‍we’re doing, but it’s definitely on the roadmap.”\nPurohit ⁤highlighted ‍the potential‍ of this technology by ⁤noting that ‌professors are already ​utilizing⁤ OpenAI’s ‍existing ⁣tools to upload an entire ⁣semester’s worth‍ of content and create customized GPTs for⁢ their students. “Students engage with‌ that finite knowledge… I think it’s⁤ a really powerful and ⁤good way ‍to⁤ let them research,” she⁢ added.\n**OpenAI’s Commitment to Education**\nOpenAI’s dedication to the ‍education ‍market ‍is ⁢further underscored by recent key appointments and product launches. in September, the ⁣company ⁤appointed Leah Belsky, former⁢ Chief Revenue​ Officer of coursera, as its first Education GM, entrusting her with the mission to expand OpenAI’s presence in schools.⁢ Earlier this year,OpenAI launched ChatGPT Edu,a‌ version of ChatGPT specifically designed for universities,demonstrating a clear commitment to meeting the unique⁢ needs of educational ‌institutions.\n**A Promising Future for Personalized Learning**\nMarket research suggests a shining future ​for AI-powered personalized learning.
