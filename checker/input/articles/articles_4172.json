    "text": "Brilla Tu Luz (SHINE a Light), es la iniciativa organizada junto a FUENTE LATINA para combatir el antisemitismo y la discriminación, elementos que se han incrementado y van desafortunadamente en ascenso. El pasado 13 de diciembre se reunieron en la ciudad de Los Ángeles, diversas personalidades, celebridades y líderes para apoyar esta causa y conocer un poco más acerca de la historia de lucha y discriminación sistemática que han recibido los judíos en el mundo. Celebridades como el renombrado Bernard Hiller coach de Hollywood, Miss Venezuela 2019 Isbel Parra, los actores Edgardo Gazcón, Ricardo Chávez, Luis de Ita, chef Franco, el cantante Gerardo Fernández hermano de Pedro Fernández, Roxana Silva cantante peruana, la presentadora Jackeline Cacho, cineasta Vicky Contreras, el artista Marcos D’One, entre otros líderes y figuras del mundo de la televisión se han unido a esta iniciativa para crear conciencia y buscar unir nuestras comunidades en lugar de dividirlas. Comunidades como los latinos, africanos, asiáticos también se han visto afectados en los últimos años donde SHINE a Light #BrillaTuLuz busca atacar el antisemitismo por medio de información y educación, un problema muy grande debido a la desinformación y un algoritmo en las redes sociales que promueve el odio. “Este evento nos ayuda a concientizar lo vivido y hacer un llamado de atención ya que han ocurrido más de 2,000 ataques en contra de judíos en Estados Unidos; y muchos de estos han ocurrido en California y en Los Ángeles” comentó Leah Soibel, fundadora de Fuente Latina. Por su parte Alec Gancman, sobreviviente del Holocausto, quien nació en Rusia, creció en Uruguay y vive en Los Ángeles, comenta que este evento ayudará a educar y valorar lo vivido para concientizar a la juventud, donde también hace un llamado a la educación en escuelas para aprender todo lo vivido en el holocausto y que esto no se vuelva a repetir.",

    "text": "It’s the time of year when many people vow to adopt better eating habits. But despite making a sincere effort, most don’t reach their goal. Why? They think that eating healthier means overhauling everything.\nMore on Healthy Eating How to Choose a Good Extra Virgin Olive Oil Is Green Juice Good for You? The Best-Tasting Canned Beans Finding the Best Pasta Sauce The Truth About 'Natural' Sweeteners The truth is, even little tweaks in your meals can have a significant impact on your energy, mood, and overall well-being. “Small, manageable changes are sustainable, and they give you a sense of success that keeps you motivated,” says Dolores Woods, a registered dietitian at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health.\nThe rewards can be huge. A study published in 2021 in the journal Nature Food found that trading just 10 percent of your daily calories from beef and processed meats to more nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and fish, can increase your healthy life span. So you may not only live longer but also extend the amount of time you live free of serious illness. For someone eating 2,000 calories, that means trading just 200 calories—roughly one snack or side dish a day. Want to try this and our other expert-advised ideas? Start the year off right by making a few small changes every day.\nHealthy Up Your Breakfast We tend to lose muscle and strength with age, but getting enough protein can help protect against this, Woods says. Plus, protein takes longer to break down than carbs, which slows the release of blood sugar. According to a 2017 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , people who had a high-protein breakfast (30 percent of calories from protein) experienced a better insulin response and blood glucose level after 4 hours compared with those who had mostly carbs.\nYet nearly half of older adults don’t get the recommended 0.36 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day (54 grams for a 150-pound person). To get a head start, add some protein to your morning meal. Top toast with cottage cheese or an egg, stir nut butter into oatmeal, or pair cereal with Greek yogurt and chia seeds. Bonus: You’ll feel fuller and have a steady supply of energy throughout the morning.\nTry New Grains It’s no secret that whole grains are healthier, with more fiber and B vitamins, than refined ones. This extra nutrition is particularly important for older adults. A study published in 2021 in The Journal of Nutrition found that people ages 55 and older who ate at least three servings of whole grains daily had better markers of heart health—smaller increases in waist size, blood pressure, and blood sugar—compared with those who got less than half a serving. Bored with brown rice and oatmeal? Try amaranth , buckwheat, farro, or quinoa.\nAdd One More Fruit or Vegetable to Your Plate While experts recommend five or more servings of produce a day, even smaller amounts boost heart health. A 2014 study in BMJ found that every extra daily serving—up to five—slashes the risk of dying of heart disease by 4 percent. Each fruit and vegetable contains its own combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that fight inflammation , says Judy Simon, a registered dietitian with the University of Washington.\nFor the biggest benefit, choose an assortment of colorful fruits and vegetables. According to 2023 research in The Journal of Nutrition , people over age 50 who consumed the biggest variety of produce were 21 percent less likely to die from heart disease over a 15-year span compared with those who had the least. Simon suggests tossing extra veggies into your main course. You can also add greens to soups and sandwiches, broccoli or cauliflower in stir-fries, and mushrooms, peppers, or zucchini to pasta dishes.\nEat Your Greens First Leafy greens help protect brain health , broccoli and brussels sprouts are potential cancer preventers, and green peas can improve digestive health. So when you sit down to a meal, start with your greens to make sure you’re getting them in your diet, Woods says. Plus, eating veggies before the rest of your meal can lower your blood sugar response afterward, according to scientists from Cornell University. This may help people with prediabetes and diabetes—close to half of Americans—keep their conditions in check.\nLearn About Labels “Made with whole grains” and “multigrain” products are often made with mainly refined white flour. Look for the words “ 100% whole grains ,” says Vijaya Surampudi, MD, an associate professor of medicine at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition. “Or check that a whole grain is listed as the first ingredient.”\nSnack on Nuts Many snack staples, such as pretzels, cereal bars, and crackers, are highly processed. A diet high in these packaged foods is linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and dementia. But a review of research published in the journal Antioxidants suggests a diet high in nuts can protect against conditions like these. “They’re high in healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals,” Simon says. Aim for an ounce—about a handful—of nuts a day.\nPair Treats With Healthy Foods You don’t need to give up ice cream and chips, Simon says. Serve yourself a small portion with food that’s high in fiber or protein. Top ice cream with fresh fruit, dip chips into hummus, and mix chocolate with nuts. These additions slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream, she says, which can stave off a blood sugar spike and the energy crash that follows.\nEditor’s Note: A version of this article also appeared in the January 2024 issue of Consumer Reports On Health .",

    "title": "Why the Steelers are the unchecked box on the Geno Smith revenge tour - Field Gulls",
    "text": "Fate works in mysterious ways, doesn’t it? Last year, [Seattle Seahawks](https://www.fieldgulls.com/) quarterbacks Geno Smith notched nothing but wins against his three previous teams, culminating in the mathematical elimination of his original team, the [New York Jets](https://www.ganggreennation.com/). He followed that up with a season-extending overtime win over the [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.turfshowtimes.com/), whom he played his first non-garbage time snaps against in place of the injured Russell Wilson back in 2021. This year, again with the playoffs on the line, the Smith revenge tour has one more stop to make. In the penultimate week of the regular season, Geno will face the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/), the same team whom he faced in his first Seahawks start on Sunday Night Football. The eventual glimpse into the post-Wilson era was not promising. A bizarrely pass-heavy 1st half saw Smith throw for just 8/14 for 63 yards, with 0 points scored and only 3 first downs achieved. The pass-run ratio was 80-20 for no particularly good reason. First-year offensive coordinator Shane Waldron changed things up at halftime, opting to establish the run to the Nth degree. The late Alex Collins stormed out of the gates with 56 rushing yards on 8 carries, fittingly scoring Seattle’s first touchdown. He would finish with 101 yards on 20 carries, the final 100-yard game of his career. A 10-play, 75-yard— NFL (@NFL) [@Seahawks]TD drive cuts the Steelers lead in half. : [#SEAvsPIT]on NBC : NFL app [pic.twitter.com/XjzXncW5tm] [October 18, 2021] The next scoring drive was all about Geno and tight ends Gerald Everett and Will Dissly.

It was apparent that Seattle leaned towards the field goal, although DK Metcalf’s incredibly risky attempt to score a touchdown almost wrecked the entire mission. Madness on this play.— NFL (@NFL) [@Seahawks]get into field goal range with seconds left. : [#SEAvsPIT]on NBC : NFL app [pic.twitter.com/xKD5WbIfKH] [October 18, 2021] In overtime, Geno had two chances to lead Seattle to an unlikely road win in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, TJ Watt got in the way. ELECTRIC.— NFL (@NFL) [@_TJWatt] : [#SEAvsPIT]on NBC : NFL app [pic.twitter.com/bFVIv4fu6R] [October 18, 2021] TJ WATT FORCES THE FUMBLE.— NFL (@NFL) [#HereWeGo] : [#SEAvsPIT]on NBC : NFL app [pic.twitter.com/SbUBpLy0qI] [October 18, 2021] Current Seahawks linebacker Devin Bush corrected himself to run the right way on the fumble recovery. Game, set, and match. Geno’s only “turnover-worthy play” on the night was an actual turnover, and it essentially lost the game. “I hate coming up short,” Smith said [after the loss]. “We can’t keep coming up short. I can’t keep coming up short. I put that on myself. Back to back weeks, our defense gives us a chance to go out there and score. Give me the ball and we don’t get it done. That’s solely on me, and I vow to be better.” Smith finished 23/32 for 209 yards and a touchdown, with an average depth of target at 4.1 yards, the second shortest of all of his Seahawks starts. The plan was safe and conservative—the four screen passes went for -1 yard—perhaps indicative of both Geno as the then-backup and the state of Seattle’s offensive line. These were the Seahawks’ starters that day: Left Tackle: Duane Brown Left Guard: Damien Lewis Center: Kyle Fuller Right Guard: Gabe Jackson Right Tackle: Brandon Shell Extra Offensive Lineman: Jamarco Jones Geno was sacked 5 times on 11 pressures. Not only is Lewis the only starter still with the Seahawks, he’s the only one who’s even on an active NFL 53-man roster. Brown just went to IR on the New York Jets, Fuller is in the USFL, Jackson is on the [Carolina Panthers](https://www.catscratchreader.com/) practice squad, Shell retired, and Jones is unsigned. What a difference two years makes. The 2023 edition of Steelers vs. Seahawks is sort of a playoff eliminator for Pittsburgh and a must-have for Seattle in order to stay in a wild card spot. It’s Geno’s chance to even the score and put his team one step closer to another postseason berth. Ideally, for a change, a last-minute drive will not be required to win. If that’s what it comes to, I think Smith has shown enough in his two seasons as a starter to indicate that he’s capable of delivering in the clutch.",
