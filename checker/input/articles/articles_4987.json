    "title": "3场夏联，仅20分+9篮板！火箭队第4中锋难留队？双向合同也悬了|丹特|内线|史密斯_网易订阅",
    "text": "现如今火箭队最强大的位置无非就是他们的锋线和内线。锋线有杜兰特、小史密斯、阿门、伊森这样的明星球员，甚至还引进了芬尼·史密斯这样的老将，他们的前锋线不仅可用人手多，而且每一个球员都有自己独特的技能。\n而内线尤其是中锋位置，也是火箭队的精华所在，上赛季火箭队的内线位置就已经是联盟顶尖的，既有全明星中锋申京，也有联盟当中的名将亚当斯，甚至还有第三中锋兰代尔。要知道兰代尔当年在太阳队和马刺队都是主要轮换中锋，在火箭队当中，这么好的中锋都没有太多的出场机会，难以进入轮换阵容，足以见得火箭队5号位有多强大。\n而火箭队上赛季第四中锋、落选秀恩法利·丹特也被很多人忽略了。毕竟丹特长时间在发展联盟效力，他只拿着一份火箭队提供的双向合同。在有限的为一线队出场的时间里，丹特的表现其实也不含糊。还记得有一场比赛，他得到了进入轮换的机会，单场贡献了10分、9个篮板，不管是吃饼还是护筐，都做得有模有样。\n但现在火箭队这位第四中锋恩法利·丹特似乎难以留在队中，虽说火箭队之前给丹特开出了双向合同的资质报价，但目前他们并没有宣布正式和丹特签约。目前丹特正在代表火箭队出战夏季联赛，在三场夏季联赛的比赛里，火箭队的战绩十分惨淡，0胜3负，到现在为止也没能赢下一场球。其实前一场火箭队是有机会战胜老鹰的，但最后时刻的离谱失误也让火箭队前功尽弃。而且少了后场核心谢泼德，火箭队在进攻端形同散沙。\n作为三场比赛火箭的首发中锋，丹特其实他的表现也并不好。三场比赛丹特一共只得到了20分，另外还有9个篮板，作为护筐型中锋的他，三场只摘下了9个篮板，显然在篮板能力上面，丹特在夏季联赛里的表现起伏过大。而且在进攻端，他更多的是依靠队友的传球去得分，他并没有那种自主得分能力，更不具备投篮能力。\n换句话说，丹特就是一位标准的蓝领型中锋，也就是那种“黑又硬”的中锋，在联盟当中这样的中锋一抓一大把，丹特没有自己独特的技能，在防守端也是时好时坏，篮板球的保护更是不力。所以三场比赛下来，丹特一共只得到了20分、9篮板，作为首发中锋的他，显然对火箭队三连败是逃不脱干系的。\n如今火箭队内线已经有了申京、亚当斯和新来的卡佩拉，丹特生存的空间更小了，而且到现在为止，火箭也没有给丹特正式的合同或者签下双向合同，这位第四中锋下赛季预计很难留在队中，毕竟夏季联赛是展现自己的最好的舞台，可是丹特并没有抓住机会。",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Apologies in advance if you’ve already secured your winter coat for this season. You may want to avert your eyes. Why? Well, if you must know, Canadian tastemaker JJJJound and Japanese alpine outerwear stalwart Descente have just announced ‘Chapter 2’ of their two-part collaboration. Suffice to say the second helping of JJJJound x Descente contains (amongst other things) some truly spectacular outerwear.\nThe collection sticks to the monochromatic, minimalistic aesthetic that has become JJJJound’s calling card. Think jet black punctuated by subtle storm blue accents – a nod to the softer blues of the first chapter. Among the highlights is a shell jacket optimised for weather resistance, matching trousers for full-body coverage, and a long shell coat that marries technical expertise with a sleek silhouette. Completing the lineup is a synthetic jean, which adds a tailored edge, and two water-repellent bags: a duffle and a compact passport option. As you might expect from two such labels, it’s a collection engineered for those who value function but prefer not to shout about it.\nJJJJound x Descente: Behind the brands\nFor the uninitiated, JJJJound began life as a digital mood board curated by Justin Saunders, a designer with an eye for timeless simplicity. Over the years, it has evolved into a brand synonymous with quiet luxury, offering collaborations that sell out faster than you can refresh your browser. Descente, meanwhile, is a Japanese sportswear institution with nearly a century of expertise in performance apparel, blending innovative technologies with a clean design language. Together, the two brands find common ground in creating pieces that blur the lines between utility and sophistication.\nChapter 2 feels like a natural evolution of this partnership, appealing to two archetypes: the rugged and active, and the restrained and elegant. Whether you’re layering up for a harsh winter commute or simply looking for a coat that does it all, this collection has it covered.\nThe JJJJound Descente Chapter 2 collection launches on January 23rd at 10 PM EST on JJJJound.com, January 24th at 12 PM JST on Descente’s online store, and January 25th in-store at Descente Blanc Daikanyama. If last year’s collection was anything to go by, you’ll need to act quickly.\nNext up: Ski jacket brands you need to know.",

    "text": "Nashik: Wineries in the city and tourist sites are teeming with tourists because of the Christmas season and upcoming New Year.All rooms in resorts of prominent wineries and all hotels across Nashik city-Igatpuri-Trimbakeshwar areas are 100% booked till Jan 4 next year.Wineries said that the footfall of tourists has doubled since Saturday.The Boat Club of Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), located on the backwaters of Gangapur Dam, is also drawing tourists. The Boat Club was closed for the past five months since July 31 and reopened on Dec 24.Usually, the rides at the boat club are stopped during the rainy season from July 15 to Oct 15. But this year, MTDC stopped boat rides at the club from July 1 due to low water level in the dam. Later, it could not get the Water Resources Department's (WRD) nod to restart the club due to model code of conduct in place for assembly polls.\\\"We have started boat club rides from Tuesday (Dec 24). Most tourists don't know whether the boat rides have started. But the footfall will increase in the next few days as more tourists come to know about it,\\\" said an MTDC official.The Nashik city-Trimbakeshwar-Igatpuri belt has around 2,000 hotels offering 45,000 rooms, alongside 1,000 farmhouses with 6,000 rooms. All the rooms in the wineries and hotels in and around Nashik city have been booked 100% till January 4, said Datta Bhalerao, chairman, tourism committee of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA).Nashik is drawing tourists not only from Mumbai and Pune but also Gujarat, Karnataka, and other states in the country. It has also become easier for tourists to travel to Nashik due to air connectivity with various cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Ahmedabad, Goa, and Nagpur, said Bhalerao, who is also a senior member and past president of Travel Agents Association of Nashik (TAAN).Nashik is already famous for religious tourism due to Kalaram Temple, Godavari, and Trimbakeshwar Temple. But at the same time, it has also emerged as the wine capital of the country. Hence, those who come for religious tourism visit the different wineries in and around Nashik, added Bhalerao.Jagdish Holkar, president, All India Wine Producers Association (AIWPA), said, \\\"The footfall of tourists visiting prominent wineries in Nashik has already doubled in the last four-five days compared to the footfall around a week ago. The number of tourists will increase further in the next nine days till Jan 4,\\\" said Holkar.Apart from Sula Vineyards and Soma Wine, other wineries such as York, Vallonnie, Grover Zampa, Renaissance, Good Drops, etc are also attracting a good footfall of tourists. Sula Vineyards attracts around 60% of total footfall of tourists in wineries in Nashik. Sula has 104 rooms, including a 67-room resort in the winery.\\\"All the rooms in our resort is fully booked. The footfall of tourists also increased significantly in the last five days since Saturday,\\\" said Monit Dhavale, senior vice-president, Sula Vineyards.Pradeep Pachpatil, chairman of another major winery, Soma Wines, said that all the rooms in his 60-room resort are booked till Jan 3. The footfall of tourists to the winery also doubled in the last five days due to the festive season.Nagendra Sardeshpande, a medical practitioner from Mumbai, said that this is his third visit to Nashik winery in the last five years. \\\"I stay here for at least a couple of days whenever I come here. I also like to taste different types of wine,\\\" he said.Yogesh Patil, another tourist from Mumbai, said that he came to the city with his family members on Wednesday and will stay here for the next two days. \\\"Nashik is a beautiful city and the climate is also pleasant. Staying at the resort on the premises of a winery near the backwaters of Gangapur Dam has been a good experience for us,\\\" he said.",
