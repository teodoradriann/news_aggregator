    "text": "Dublin Boat Rally in Jeopardy as Bridge Closure Halts Canal Traffic Published: 2025/05/01 04:11:30\nDublin’s waterways, usually bustling with activity in late spring, face an unexpected quiet. The annual Dublin Boat Rally, along with several planned flotillas and water parades, are now threatened after irish Rail announced the Newcomen Lifting Bridge is inoperable, effectively blocking access to the city center from the Royal Canal.\ndid you know? The Royal Canal stretches over 145 kilometers, connecting Dublin to the River Shannon, making it a vital waterway for leisure and transport.\nMajor Events Affected by Bridge Malfunction The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland’s (IWAI) Big Cruise, a highlight for boating enthusiasts, is among the events thrown into disarray. This cruise features a series of activities spanning the Grand and Royal canals, culminating in the Dublin Rally. The event typically includes parades of boats on the River liffey and activities centered in the Grand Canal Basin.\nKay Baxter, outgoing president of the IWAI, expressed the disappointment felt by many. “The knock-on effect extends to the IWAI Dublin Rally, the annual trip up the Liffey on May 17th and the parade of boats in the Dublin Basin,” she said.\nYears of Planning Now Imperiled For many participants, the Big Cruise and Dublin Rally represent the culmination of over a year’s worth of planning. The news of the bridge closure has especially impacted a flotilla of approximately 20 boats, which departed from the Shannon in County Longford on april 4th. The group is currently stalled at Confey, near Leixlip on the Dublin-Kildare border, after learning about the indefinite closure of the Newcomen Bridge in Dublin’s north docklands.\nPro Tip: Always check for waterway notices and updates before embarking on a long journey by boat. Contact local authorities for the most current facts.\nRather than navigate a series of locks and bridges only to be turned back at the Newcomen Bridge, the flotilla opted to halt their progress, according to Baxter.\nThe canceled events also dashed the dreams of some enthusiasts who had recently invested in boats specifically for the rally, and others hoping to recreate Tom Rolt’s historic voyage described in “Green and Silver,” a chronicle of a 1949 journey through ireland’s inland waterways.\nColm Meyler from the boat Carrigeen, one of the flotilla boats on the Royal Canal. Photograph: Alan Betson Irish Rail responds: Faulty Motor Blamed Irish Rail acknowledged the disruption caused by the bridge malfunction, stating they regretted “that a fault with the Newcomen Lifting Bridge has impacted on the IWAI’s upcoming events”.\nHowever, a spokesman for Irish Rail disputed the IWAI’s version of events, calling their “characterisation of the circumstances…inaccurate and unfair”.\nAccording to the spokesman, the issue began last August with a suspected electrical fault. While electrical components were replaced,a subsequent test lift in 2025 revealed a more essential problem: “A fortnight ago,we undertook the first of the bridge lifts in 2025 for IWAI,during which the motor for the gear crank failed,resulting in the bridge being stuck in the upright position. It is our view now that this was the original fault, which it transpires was intermittent in nature. The fault two weeks ago did delay trains for a time until the bridge was lowered.”\nDespite the current setback, irish Rail expressed hope that the bridge could be repaired and operational “to facilitate bridge lifts later in the season.”\nRipple Effects Beyond the Rally The impact of the bridge closure extends beyond the Dublin Boat Rally. A group from Clontarf yacht Club was forced to scrap plans to travel down the Royal Canal to the River Shannon and return via the Grand Canal.\n[ ‘It’s cheaper to drive’: Commuters react to Irish Rail fare rises Opens in new window ]\nFAQ: Dublin Boat Rally Disruption Q: What is the main reason for the Dublin Boat Rally disruption?\nA: A fault with the Newcomen Lifting Bridge is preventing boats from entering Dublin via the Royal Canal. Q: Which events are affected by the bridge closure?\nA: The IWAI Big Cruise, the annual Dublin Boat Rally, parades on the river Liffey, and activities in the Grand Canal Basin are all impacted. Q: What is Irish Rail’s explanation for the bridge malfunction?\nA: Irish Rail states that a motor for the gear crank failed, causing the bridge to become stuck. Q: Is there any hope for the events to be rescheduled?\nA: Irish Rail hopes to repair the bridge and facilitate lifts later in the season.\nWhat do you think are the long-term implications of this infrastructure failure on Dublin’s waterways and events like the Dublin Boat Rally? share your thoughts in the comments below\nInterview: Navigating the Waters of Disruption – Examining the Dublin Boat Rally Crisis Archyde News Editor sat down with Eamon O’Malley, a maritime engineer specializing in bridge mechanics, to discuss the recent closure of the Newcomen Lifting Bridge and its impact on the Dublin Boat Rally and associated events.\nEamon O’Malley: It’s a real blow for everyone involved, especially the enthusiasts who look forward to these events all year.\nArchyde News Editor: Thanks for joining us,Eamon. Could you explain, in layman’s terms, what happened with the Newcomen Lifting Bridge? Eamon O’Malley: certainly. Based on the data from Irish Rail,it seems the motor responsible for raising and lowering the bridge’s gear crank has failed. This means the bridge is stuck in the upright position, effectively blocking boat traffic from the Royal Canal into the city center and disrupting planned events.\nArchyde News Editor: The article mentions this isn’t the frist issue with the bridge. What could have caused this, and how common are these types of failures? Eamon O’malley: Intermittent electrical faults can be tricky to diagnose. The initial suspected electrical issue and later motor failure point to potential wear and tear, or possibly inadequate maintenance. These types of mechanical failures, though not always frequent, are certainly not unheard of, especially for older infrastructure.\nArchyde News Editor: We’re now seeing the ripple effects, with events like the IWAI Big Cruise and the Dublin Boat Rally being cancelled. How long might it take to repair this type of bridge failure? Eamon O’Malley: It depends on the extent of the damage and the availability of parts. If it’s a straightforward motor replacement, it could be a matter of weeks. Though, if it involves more extensive repairs, like gear damage or structural issues, the timeframe could easily stretch into months.This could mean the events will be postponed or cancelled as suggested.\nArchyde News Editor: Irish Rail expressed hope to have the bridge operational later in the season. From an engineering standpoint, what are the key challenges in getting the Newcomen Lifting Bridge back in service to allow boat rally events? Eamon O’malley: The primary challenge is the age and design of the bridge. Finding replacement parts that will fit might potentially be challenging. Moreover, the structure’s integrity must be thoroughly assessed.The engineers must ensure all mechanical and electrical systems, not just the motor, are inspected and compliant with safety regulations before declaring it fit for use to ensure safety.\narchyde News Editor: The closure has affected the Dublin Boat Rally and related activities. Considering this, what’s your overall assessment of this situation? Eamon O’Malley: This is a complex situation involving infrastructure issues. The long-term solution must consider a extensive maintenance schedule and, where necessary, upgrades to minimize future disruptions. Hopefully, the issue can be fixed to enable upcoming events by the IWAI organization but for everyone associated with the Dublin boat Rally and the wider maritime community, the impact is notable.\nArchyde News Editor: Thanks for your insights, Eamon.what could be done to prevent similar issues in the future? Eamon O’Malley: A proactive maintenance plan is crucial, including regular inspections, component testing, and timely replacement of worn parts. Also the possibility of a structural overhaul in terms of design to cater for newer equipment to reduce the likelihood of future mechanical malfunctions.Modernization of the technology might be a possible solution.\nArchyde News Editor: Thank you, Eamon, for this insightful discussion. It’s a very tough situation! what do you think are the long-term implications of this infrastructure failure on Dublin’s waterways and events like the Dublin Boat Rally?

    "text": "For many years, Australia's Pilbara region has been a symbol of rapid growth and prosperity in the mining industry. Located in Western Australia, it has served as the country's main economic engine for decades, drawing on its rich iron ore reserves. Huge piles of crushed brown rock, up to 200,000 tons each, ready to be shipped to Asian steel mills were a common sight at the port of Parker Point. However, today, according to an expert in the field of metallurgy, Stanislav Kondrashov, the region is facing new challenges: the fading of the Chinese infrastructure boom and the need to transition to more environmentally friendly technologies.\nStanislav Kondrashov: fading Chinese demand for iron ore and its impact on the Pilbara economy\nChina, which consumes about 85% of Australia's iron ore, has a huge impact on the economy of the Pilbara, a region that has long been the main source of this raw material. However, recent trends in the Chinese economy and real estate sector are beginning to put pressure on this traditional export route.\nAccording to Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG, demand for steel in China has been stable and high for a long time, but now it is approaching its peak. China's steel production is expected to peak before the end of the current decade. This is largely due to a slowdown in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest consumers of steel in the country.\nThe crisis in China's real estate sector, which traditionally used much of its steel production, has led to a decrease in demand for steel. This in turn impacts Australian iron ore import requirements, inevitably leading to lower export earnings for the Pilbara.\nWith demand for iron ore falling in China, the Pilbara economy faces a number of challenges. Since the region is heavily dependent on iron ore exports, Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG is confident that it is necessary to look for alternative markets or develop other sectors of the economy to compensate for possible losses:\nTo overcome these challenges, the region will need to diversify its economic activities. This could include developing other sectors such as tourism or renewable energy, as well as finding new markets for iron ore exports outside China .\nStanislav Kondrashov: environmental challenges and innovations\nModern steel production, which has not changed since the 14th century, is a high-carbon process. In search of a solution to this problem, alternative technologies are being developed, such as electric arc furnaces and direct reduction of iron using natural gas. According to Stanislav Kondrashov, in the long term it is planned to use “green” hydrogen, which will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the steel production process.\nTypical Australian iron ore has an iron content of between 56% and 62%, making it less suitable for new technologies without further processing. This could increase costs by 25%, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Such changes will inevitably impact the competitiveness of the Australian iron ore industry in the global market.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Australian iron ore industry must adapt, not only technologically but also strategically. This requires innovation, rethinking production processes and possibly diversifying markets. The road ahead is difficult, but it is precisely periods like these that often become an effective catalyst for major industrial and economic transformations, - Kondrashov says. Reimagining the future of Australia's iron ore industry is not just a necessity, but an opportunity for innovation and sustainable development. The Pilbara and the entire Australian iron ore industry now stand on the threshold of a new era that will determine their place in the global economy of the future.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Telf AG\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: Switzerland\nWebsite: https://telf.ch/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "title": "HRW acusa M23 e Ruanda de bombardear \"indiscriminadamente\" campos de deslocados",
    "text": "HRW acusa M23 e Ruanda de bombardear \"indiscriminadamente\" campos de deslocados A ONG Human Rights Watch (HRW) acusou nesta quinta-feira a rebelião do M23 e o exército ruandês de \"bombardearem indiscriminadamente\" desde o início do ano campos de deslocados perto de Goma, no leste da República Democrática do Congo onde, segundo esta organização, a população também é alvo de violências do exército congolês. Publicado a: Modificado a: Depois de uma relativa acalmia, a partir de Novembro de 2021, o M23 (\"Movimento de 23 de Março\"), grupo armado maioritariamente tutsi que Kinshasa acusa dde ser apoiado pelo Ruanda, tomou o controlo de vastas extensões de território no leste da RDC, região rica em minerais e palco de contínuos confrontos há três décadas. As violências protagonizadas pelo M23 com o suposto apoio de forças ruandesas provocou uma crise humanitária sem precedentes com quase 7 milhões de deslocados internos, muitos dos quais encontraram refúgio em campos nos arredores de Goma, no leste da RDC. \"Desde o início de 2024, o exército ruandês e o grupo armado M23 bombardeiam indiscriminadamente campos de deslocados e outras áreas densamente povoadas perto de Goma\", afirma em [comunicado ](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2024/09/26/rd-congo-les-forces-rwandaises-et-les-rebelles-du-m23-ont-bombarde-des-zones)a delegação da HRW no Quénia. De acordo com esta ONG de defesa dos Direitos Humanos, existem dados sobre cinco ataques \"claramente ilegais\", em que bombardeamentos atingiram civis. A Human Rights Watch menciona nomeadamente um ataque que causou oficialmente 35 mortos no campo de Mugunga no passado dia 3 de Maio. Washington acusa \"as forças armadas de Ruanda e do M23\" de estar na origem dos disparos, uma acusação que Kigali qualificou de \"ridícula\" e \"absurda\". A HRW aponta também um dedo acusador sobre o exército congolês. Segundo a ONG, as tropas congolesas e seus aliados \"colocaram os deslocados em maior risco ao colocar artilharia nas proximidades\". Por outro lado, esta organização também denuncia ataques e abusos das tropas congolesas e seus aliados nesses mesmos campos. \"Soldados congoleses e uma coligação de milícias responsáveis por abusos conhecidos como ‘Wazalendo’ (os patriotas, em swahili) abriram fogo dentro de campos de deslocados, matando e ferindo civis\", refere a HRW que também denuncia casos de violações de mulheres dentro e fora dos campos de deslocados. Já no passado mês de Agosto, um estudo da Médicos Sem Fronteiras indicava que mais de uma em cada dez mulheres jovens afirmava ter sido violadas nos campos de deslocados de Goma. \"Ambas as partes mataram habitantes dos campos, cometeram violações, travaram o fornecimento de ajuda humanitária e cometeram outros abusos\", resume a HRW. Uma situação perante a qual o Presidente congolês Félix Tshisekedi reclamou ontem na Assembleia Geral da ONU \"sanções direccionadas\" contra o Ruanda, evocando \"uma grave violação da soberania nacional\" congolesa. Muito embora Kinshasa, os Estados Unidos e a França tenham acusado em diversas ocasiões o Ruanda de apoiar o M23, o Conselho de Segurança da ONU limitou-se até agora a condenar o \"apoio militar estrangeiro\" dado ao M23. Refira-se, por outro lado, que estas acusações surgem numa altura em que Angola afirma que a RDC e o Ruanda estão [prestes a chegar a um consenso](https://www.rfi.fr/pt/áfrica-lusófona/20240925-joão-lourenço-anuncia-que-rdc-e-ruanda-estão-a-negociar-assinatura-de-acordo-de-paz). Na passada terça-feira, na tribuna da Assembleia Geral da ONU, o Presidente angolano que está a mediar as negociações entre os dois países afirmou que \"foi colocada sobre a mesa uma proposta de um acordo de paz formulada pela República de Angola, envolvendo a República Democrática do Congo e a República do Ruanda, cujos termos vêm sendo discutidos pelas partes a nível ministerial\". Esta proposta de acordo, contudo, não envolve os rebeldes do M23. NewsletterReceba a newsletter diária RFI: noticiários, reportagens, entrevistas, análises, perfis, emissões, programas.

    "title": "Il cancro al polmone rimane una sfida globale urgente in Medio Oriente e Africa (LAA)",
    "text": "Il cancro al polmone rimane la principale causa di decessi correlati al cancro a livello globale, con 2,21 milioni di nuovi casi e 1,8 milioni di decessi ogni anno. Questa piaga non si limita solo a statistiche allarmanti; provoca inoltre notevoli impatti economici e sociali, colpendo non solo i pazienti ma anche le loro famiglie e i sistemi sanitari. Nella regione del Medio Oriente e dell’Africa (MEA), la situazione è particolarmente preoccupante. La mancanza di una diagnosi precoce e di approcci sistematici fa sì che la maggior parte dei casi venga diagnosticata in uno stadio avanzato. Ciò si traduce in una prognosi sfavorevole, con tassi di mortalità che raggiungono circa il 90%. Questi dati evidenziano l’urgenza di un’azione coordinata per migliorare l’individuazione e il trattamento del cancro ai polmoni. Il policy brief lanciato dalla filiale del Medio Oriente e dell’Africa della Lung Ambition Alliance (LAA) mira a migliorare l’accesso alla diagnosi precoce del cancro ai polmoni e ad aumentare i tassi di sopravvivenza in queste regioni. Fornisce un quadro strutturato per l’implementazione di programmi di screening, attingendo alle migliori pratiche locali e affrontando le sfide del sistema sanitario. Il cancro al polmone, la principale causa di morte per cancro a livello globale, viene spesso diagnosticato tardi nella regione, portando ad alti tassi di mortalità. La nota raccomanda di dare priorità al cancro del polmone a livello nazionale, coinvolgendo le varie parti interessate (governi, società civile e pazienti) e conducendo iniziative di sensibilizzazione culturalmente appropriate. Sottolinea inoltre l’importanza di valutare i benefici in termini di costi dei programmi di screening e di utilizzare tecnologie innovative come l’intelligenza artificiale per migliorare questi sforzi. La nota ricorda che gli esperti di oncologia hanno espresso il loro impegno nella lotta al cancro al polmone in Egitto e nella regione, chiedendo una collaborazione intersettoriale per attuare queste raccomandazioni e migliorare i risultati dei pazienti riducendo al contempo la pressione sui sistemi sanitari. Va sottolineato che la Lung Ambition Alliance Middle East and Africa è una coalizione globale, lanciata nel settembre 2023, che riunisce partner di vari settori in più di 50 paesi. Il suo obiettivo è accelerare l’innovazione e migliorare la situazione delle persone affette da cancro ai polmoni. Swiss",
