    "title": "PFF: Cardinals' D-line 1 of most improved in free agency",
    "text": "PFF lists Cardinals defensive line as 1 of most improved units from NFL free agency\nMar 19, 2025, 3:31 PM\nAs the Arizona Cardinals’ work during NFL free agency winds down, one NFL writer thinks the team has made top progress toward improving one position in particular on the team.\nPFF’s Max Chadwick listed the Cardinals’ defensive line as the most improved position unit from free agency. Chadwick noted the signing of edge rusher Josh Sweat and re-signing of outside linebacker Baron Browning as key additions to a team ranked 28th in the NFL in defensive line play.\nThe Cardinals had the fifth-lowest-graded defensive line in the NFL last season. In response, Arizona invested nearly $125 million in its defensive front.\nThe Cardinals’ biggest addition came by adding edge defender Josh Sweat. He earned 70.0-plus PFF grades in four of the past five seasons and posted 10.5 sacks for the Philadelphia Eagles in the regular season and playoffs last year. They also brought back Baron Browning to man the other edge defender spot, and he ranked 23rd in both pass-rush grade and pass-rush win rate last year.\nSweat registered 41 tackles and eight sacks with the Philadelphia Eagles last season. Sweat had an impressive playoff performance for the Eagles, registering 10 total tackles, including 2.5 sacks in a Super Bowl win against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nChadwick also noted the signing of defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson as a key addition to the defensive line. Second-year defensive lineman Darius Robinson was circled as a player to watch in 2025.\nArizona’s major addition at defensive tackle came in the form of Dalvin Tomlinson, who’s been one of the 32 highest-graded interior defenders in seven of his eight seasons. The Cardinals are hoping 2024 first-round pick Darius Robinson can make a jump in Year 2 to solidify one of the other spots on the interior defensive line.\nTomlinson registered 16 tackles with four sacks with the Cleveland Browns and had a 67.4 PFF grade in 2024, 42nd in the NFL. In eight seasons, the 6-foot-3, 325-pound lineman has registered 316 tackles and 16 sacks with the Browns, New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings.\nWhat the Cardinals defensive line looks like following free agency?\nThe Cardinals’ additions of Sweat and Tomlinson look to improve a defense that was 13th in total sacks last season with 41, despite no player on the team having more than outside linebacker Zaven Collins’ five sacks.\nAlong with the additions of Sweat and Tomlinson and re-signing Browning, the Cardinals also brought back L.J. Collier on a one-year deal.\nThe Cardinals lost several defensive players in free agency, including linemen Khyiris Tonga, Roy Lopez and Naquan Jones.\nThe position is looking for better injury luck in 2025 after losing Bilal Nichols and Justin Jones to season-ending injuries, while Darius Robinson missed 11 games due to a calf issue last season.\nThe Cardinals edge-rushing unit was also hit hard by injuries, losing Dennis Gardeck to a season-ending knee injury. Outside linebacker BJ Ojualri missed the entire season due to a knee injury he sustained in training camp.",

    "title": "Reducción histórica de la deforestación en Amazonía brasileña en 2023",
    "text": "Río de Janeiro. La deforestación en la Amazonía brasileña experimentó una significativa reducción a la mitad el año pasado, según datos oficiales divulgados este viernes. Esto se produjo después de que el gobierno del presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva implementara políticas ambientalistas para frenar la creciente destrucción.\nNo obstante, el panorama fue distinto en la llanura del Cerrado, al sur de la selva tropical, donde la tala de árboles alcanzó un nuevo récord anual en 2023, aumentando un 43% en comparación con el año anterior, según el programa de vigilancia Deter del Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Espaciales.\nLos datos satelitales revelaron que la superficie de bosque destruido en la Amazonía brasileña el año pasado fue de 5.152 kilómetros cuadrados, lo que representó una caída del 50% en comparación con 2022.\nSin embargo, esto equivale a más de tres veces el tamaño de Ciudad de México en la porción brasileña de la selva tropical más grande del mundo, que desempeña un papel crucial en la absorción de los gases de carbono que contribuyen al calentamiento global.\nEn contraste, el Cerrado, un tesoro de biodiversidad con ecosistemas intrínsecamente vinculados a los de la Amazonía, experimentó la pérdida de 7.828 kilómetros cuadrados de vegetación nativa el año pasado, la cifra más alta desde que comenzó la observación en 2018.\nMariana Napolitano, del grupo ambientalista WWF-Brasil, destacó que el 2023 fue un año de logros significativos en el ámbito socioambiental, resaltando la reducción sustancial de la deforestación en la Amazonía.\nSin embargo, lamentó que no se observe la misma tendencia en el Cerrado, lo cual afecta negativamente la conservación de ese bioma y los servicios ecosistémicos esenciales que proporciona.\nLos datos recopilados para la Amazonía y el Cerrado estuvieron actualizados hasta el 29 de diciembre.\nEn conjunto, la superficie total deforestada en ambas regiones alcanzó los 12.980 kilómetros cuadrados en 2023, reflejando una disminución del 18% en comparación con 2022.\nTras ganar por un estrecho margen las tensas elecciones de 2022, Lula asumió su tercer mandato el 1°. de enero de 2023, comprometiéndose a que Brasil vuelva a liderar la lucha contra la amenaza climática. Jair Bolsonaro, aliado del poderoso agronegocio durante su mandato (2019-2022), fue fuertemente criticado internacionalmente por permitir que la deforestación amazónica aumentara en un 75% en comparación con el promedio de la década anterior.\nSegún expertos, la expansión de tierras para la agricultura y ganadería en Brasil, el principal exportador mundial de soja y carne, sigue siendo el principal impulsor de la destrucción en la Amazonía y el Cerrado.",

    "text": "Workers in New England states looking forward to a bump up in minimum wages in 2024 Workers in several New England states are looking forward to a bump up in the minimum wage in 2024 while advocates in Massachusetts are pushing a ballot question aimed at phasing out the state’s subminimum wage for tipped workers BOSTON -- Workers in several New England states are looking forward to a bump up in the minimum wage in 2024 while advocates in Massachusetts are pushing a ballot question aimed at phasing out the state's subminimum wage of $6.75 per hour for tipped workers. In Rhode Island, the state's current $13 minimum wage will jump by $1 to $14 an hour on Jan. 1. It is the next step in a phased-in increase that will reach $15 in 2025. In Vermont, the state’s minimum wage will reach $13.67 — climbing $0.49 from the current $13.18 wage. The annual adjustment also affects the minimum wage for tipped workers, which will tick up from $6.59 to $6.84 per hour. Maine will see its hourly minimum wage tick up from $13.80 to $14.15 per hour. Maine requires annual adjustments to the minimum wage based on the cost-of-living. Portland is pushing its city minimum wage from $14 to $15. The state's new tipped wage in 2024 will be $7.08 per hour. The minimum wage in Connecticut will rise from the current rate of $15.00 per hour to $15.69 — the highest in New England. Beginning Jan. 1, and occurring annually each following Jan. 1, the wage will be adjusted according to the U.S. Department of Labor’s calculation of the employment cost index. Massachusetts' minimum wage will remain at $15 per hour in 2024, although there is a campaign to hike the wage again to $20. New Hampshire continues to have the lowest minimum wage in New England, matching the federal wage of $7.25. State lawmakers have defeated multiple attempts to increase it in recent years. The New England states are among 20 raising minimum wages for workers, further widening the gap between state requirements and the federal minimum wage, which has been static at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. In several states, the new minimum will more than double that rate. In Massachusetts, advocates are pushing a ballot question that would phase out the state’s “service rate” which lets restaurants pay workers $6.75 an hour if tips make up the difference between that and the state's $15 minimum wage. Under the question, the service rate would end by 2029. Organizers for the group One Fair Wage said they have collected enough signatures to clear an initial hurdle to gaining a slot on next year's ballot. \"Massachusetts voters are ready to move away from outdated wage practices and towards a system that guarantees dignity, justice, and economic security for all workers,\" Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, said in a written statement, The Massachusetts Restaurant Association opposes the question, saying the highest-paid employees in any restaurant are tipped employees, frequently averaging $20, $30, and sometimes even $50 per hour. A restaurant owner can employ more than two full time waitstaff employees for the same hourly rate as one minimum wage employee, said Jessica Muradian of Massachusetts Restaurant Association. “This is a win for the tipped employee because they are the highest compensated employee in the restaurant, it’s a win for the guest who is getting a full-service experience and a win for the restaurant operator who gets to employ as many people as possible,” she said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Labor in August has also announced a proposed rule that would let 3.6 million more workers qualify for overtime. The proposed regulation would require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers who are in executive, administrative and professional roles but make less than $1,059 a week, or $55,068 a year for full-time employees. That salary threshold is up from $35,568.",

    "text": "Former Rep. Katie Hill and her former husband have settled the revenge porn case she filed against him and several media organizations over the unauthorized distribution of intimate photos of the onetime politician. Hill sued her ex-spouse, Kenneth Heslep, and the news groups, in Los Angeles Superior Court in December 2020, alleging nude photos of her were published without her permission. Heslep was the only remaining defendant and Hill’s lawyers filed court papers on Wednesday with Judge Kerry Bensinger stating that an accord was reached, but no terms were divulged. On June 21, Judge Serena R. Murillo put a stay on the case in light of Hill’s bankruptcy filing a year earlier. The media defendants were previously dismissed on free-speech grounds, and Hill was subsequently assessed thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees. Hill submitted a lengthy sworn declaration in opposition to one of the media defendants’ dismissal motion. “My nude body is not a matter of public interest,” Hill said. “Moreover, even if my alleged relationship was a matter of public interest, that does not justify the illegal worldwide dissemination of my nude image. I was humiliated and traumatized by the circulation of the nude image.” Hill alleged in her court papers that she lived in fear that if she left Heslep, he would kill them both as well as their animals. She “suffered extreme emotional distress, attempted suicide and was forced to quit her job, which in this case was the representative of California’s 25th Congressional District, one of the most difficult-to-get jobs in the universe,” her court papers stated. Hill, now 36, and Heslep officially divorced in October 2020. Hill, a Democrat, resigned in 2019 after the nude photos were published and news emerged that she had a three-way relationship with her husband and a campaign staffer. She was also accused of having an affair with a member of her congressional staff. Hill publicly blamed her then-husband for the release of the photos. Speaking in Congress in 2019, she decried a “misogynistic culture that gleefully consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality and enabled my abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country watching.” The 25th Congressional District includes the Santa Clarita Valley and portions of the northern San Fernando and Antelope valleys and eastern Ventura County. The seat had long been held by Republicans until Hill’s 2018 victory over then-Rep. Steve Knight. The seat is now held by Republican Mike Garcia.",
