    "title": "Beyond Meat founder and CEO: The arc of history is on our side [Video]",
    "text": "Beyond Meat founder and CEO: The arc of history is on our side Cooking up change in a well-entrenched, well-capitalized industry isn't easy. Such is the story of the ticker symbol BYND, formally known down supermarket aisles across America as Beyond Meat ( [BYND](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND?p=BYND&.tsrc=fin-srch)). While the price of Beyond Meat stock has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown hasn’t. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry exec remains laser-focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level. \"We believe the arc of history is on our side and that we're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after,\" Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's [Lead This Way](https://finance.yahoo.com/live/lead-this-way/) (video above). Beyond Meat burst onto investors' radar on May 5, 2019, with a [sizzling initial public offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/inside-c-suite-beyond-meat-142652541.html) on the Nasdaq. Investors devoured shares of a company they saw as the leader in the budding plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%. From there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with [big deals](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dunkin-beyond-meat-ceos-sit-134145185.html) with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts ( [YUM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/YUM?p=YUM&.tsrc=fin-srch)), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target ( [TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT?p=TGT&.tsrc=fin-srch)) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. By July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share. However, the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/campbell-soup-ceo-how-to-lead-successfully-with-a-military-mindset-202727449.html) hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival [Impossible Foods](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/impossible-foods-ceo-hyper-growth-150112112.html). Along the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce. Then in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter. [Third quarter sales](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1655210/000165521023000255/ex991pressrelease-q32023ea.htm) fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis. \"You know that there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and particularly after the IPO, that it was going to happen overnight,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round of layoffs. \"That obviously has not proven to be the case.\" \"But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it's the health angle, whether it's climate, whether it's the energy and water use or animal welfare,\" Brown continued. \"All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.\" Today, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for [meat king](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-ceo-on-growth-potential-for-chicken-in-challenging-economic-times-223501341.html) Tyson ( [TSN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSN?p=TSN&.tsrc=fin-srch)), per Yahoo Finance [comparison data](https://finance.yahoo.com/compare?comps=BYND,TSN). \"In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),\" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said. Goldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating. Meanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie [maker](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/barbie-brand-very-large-canvas-152040865.html) Mattel ( [MAT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MAT?p=MAT&.tsrc=fin-srch)). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food. The new facility even has a McDonald’s ( [MCD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD?p=MCD&.tsrc=fin-srch)) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches. The 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often makes the rounds in the building to chat up employees with his trademark cool, welcoming vibe. Brown acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be easy and he isn't yet in the mindset to reflect on the path of the business to this point. But he will not be deterred in his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and hustle. \"I have to see [my mission] through to completion,\" Brown said. \"I think it'll be something [that] when it's said and done, I might look back. But right now I'm in the fight, so it's hard to see.\" [Brian Sozzi](https://www.yahoo.com/author/brian-sozzi/) is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

    "text": "The Tower of London joined various global landmarks, from Brisbane to New York City, in showing the climate stripes last week.\nThe nearly 1000-year-old White Tower was transformed into a monumental canvas of red and blue late on Friday June 21 to show the progressive heating of the capital.\nThe historic building was lit up to mark Show Your Stripes Day 2024, a day when the University of Reading’s climate stripes are shared worldwide to start conversations about the Earth’s rapid warming.\nJen Stone, Sustainability Manager at Historic Royal Palaces, the charity that cares for the Tower of London, said: “The Tower of London is a place where history has been made for nearly 1000 years and it’s a place where history continues to unfold to this day.\n“As a charity, we are committed to acting for the future – of our historically significant buildings, our people and, ultimately, of the planet. This means making changes onsite – like our ambitious decarbonisation plans – and also harnessing the power of our iconic silhouette to start conversations about the climate crisis and the role we can all play.\n“University of Reading’s climate stripes graphic is a profound and yet simple way to show the world how the planet is warming. We hope the illuminations caught people’s attention and helped to start important conversations about the climate crisis.”\nNew stripes\nNASA launched its new Climate Legacies initiative, which invites users to create their own climate stripes timeline so people can see how different generations experience our changing climate.\nThe showyourstripes.info website received 65,000 visitors last week, with more than 16,000 climate stripes graphics being downloaded by site users.\nOn social media, people from all over the world used the #ShowYourStripes hashtag to post climate stripes graphics relevant to their city or country.\nThe climate stripes also appeared on a discussion about climate action on Sky News and were broadcast on several weather reports by US-based TV meteorologists.\n‘Ozi – Voice of the Forest’ , a new animated movie set to release in August, used the stripes in the background of its promotional poster.\nIlluminations and events\nOther UK landmarks that joined in with Show Your Stripes Day by displaying the stripes graphics included Lord’s Cricket Ground , BT Tower , Hay Castle and an Ecotricity wind turbine in Stroud .\nAcross the globe, the University of Reading’s climate stripes appeared on landmarks including:\nOn buildings across the USA, including Cira Centre in Philadelphia Dublin Link Bridge, Columbus; The Six Light Bridges, Houston; Baltimore City Hall; the PECO building, Philadelphia.

    "text": "XALAPA, VER.- Desde el 2020 la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE) alertó a la ciudadanía por fraudes que se estaban cometiendo en México a las personas que buscaban tramitar, renovar o actualizar su pasaporte. Ahora en 2024 se continúan registrando casos del fraude cibernético en el que estafadores engañan a las personas para robar su dinero. Modus operandi Veracruz no está exento de estos delitos, siendo el proceso para sacar la cita el paso en el que los ciber delincuentes aprovechan para entrar en contacto con las víctimas. Al hacer una búsqueda rápida en internet para solicitar una cita o informarse del procedimiento del pasaporte, se han detectado páginas falsas similares a la oficial, como pasaporteycitasregob.com.mx y pasaporteenlinea.com, ambas alertadas por la (SRE). [ÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B9cNHPwml9174xpSbK7aNQ) Te podría interesar Luego de entrar a una de estas páginas falsas, pedirán los detalles del tipo de pasaporte que se solicitará, lugar, fecha y un correo. Los estafadores mandan un mensaje al correo proporcionado con un nombre como \"Confirme su cita\" y en el mensaje piden confirmar la cita mediante un pago por el monto del tiempo de validez del pasaporte, manejando los oficiales de la SRE de México: - 3 años: 1,655 pesos. - 6 años: 2, 250 pesos. - 10 años: 3,940 pesos. La primera alerta de este tipo de correos para cometer el fraude es que permiten el pago por Oxxo o transferencia, proporcionando un número de cuenta para depositar, cuando Relaciones Exteriores tiene un proceso estricto para realizar el pago que no permite hacerlo así, ni antes de acudir a la cita. Así luce el correo que envían los estafadores (dando click en la imagen pudes ampliarla) Cómo sacar la cita Recuerda bajo ningún motivo, según las recomendaciones de la SRE, hacer pagos o transferencias previas a acudir a tu cita, asegurarte que las páginas visitadas son oficiales, pues estas usan cintillos, y no pagar por el proceso de agendar una cita, pues esto es gratuito. Actualmente la única sede en Veracruz disponible para sacar la cita directo en la página de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores es la de Xalapa. Por lo que si es en estas oficinas a las que planeas acudir, puedes hacerlo directamente en: [https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/pasaporte-ordinario-para-personas-mayores-de-edad/SRE112](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/pasaporte-ordinario-para-personas-mayores-de-edad/SRE112) Si estás en otro municipio de Veracruz, puedes agendar tu cita mediante una llamada telefónica al Call Center de la SRE, que es 5589324827 o por el WhatsApp oficial, +52 5589324827. En ambas opciones un sistema te irá indicando los pasos y datos que deberás proporcionar. Para sacar directamente en la página o desde el teléfono, debes tomar en cuenta que toda la información proporcionada será escrita, sin enviar ningún documento escaneado o fotografiado. También, que deberás tener a la mano tu CURP. Así luce el correo de confirmación de cita oficial: Así luce el chat oficial de la SRE para agendar una cita:",

    "text": "Belén Liotti\n(CNN) –– El director de un hospital en el norte de Gaza dijo que ya no pueden hacer frente a la afluencia de personas gravemente heridas y que tuvieron que trasladarlas a otro lugar.\nEl Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director del hospital Kamal Adwan en el norte de Gaza, le dijo a CNN este jueves que civiles gravemente heridos por un ataque aéreo israelí que tuvo lugar el miércoles contra una casa en el área de Beit Lahia no habían podido ser recibidos en el hospital. “Esos casos fueron trasladados a otro hospital por la falta de especialidades necesarias para el manejo de este tipo de lesiones”.\nBlinken afirma que Israel aceptó los términos de la retirada de Gaza en una”propuesta puente”, a pesar de dichos de Netanyahu\nMuchos hospitales de Gaza carecen de personal y equipos después de diez meses de conflicto y la dificultad de acceso a gran parte de Gaza para las organizaciones de ayuda.\nAbu Safiya dijo que había escasez de combustible en Kamal Adwan.\n“Ahora estamos trabajando a la capacidad mínima en la prestación de servicios. La cantidad de combustible que tenemos no es suficiente para más de 24 horas”.\nDijo que alrededor de una decena de niños están en diálisis o con ventiladores. “La falta de combustible significa el fin de la vida de estos niños”.\nAbu Safiya dijo que el combustible llegaba en “cantidades que apenas alcanzan para unos días”.\nDijo que otro problema era la propagación de enfermedades, ya que los programas de vacunación se retrasaron debido al conflicto.\n“Nos han llegado un gran número de enfermedades de la piel e infecciones intestinales (…) Es necesario reactivar las vacunas y tomar las muestras necesarias”.\nA principios de este mes, el Ministro de Salud del Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, el Dr. Majed Abu Ramadan, dijo que Gaza estaba “enfrentando un desastre humanitario en todos los sentidos de la palabra. La agresión ha provocado la destrucción de más del 80% de la infraestructura sanitaria y la mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio”.\nRecuperan en Gaza los cadáveres de seis rehenes israelíes, según las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad Israelí\nRamadan dijo que los hospitales operativos “están funcionando parcialmente debido a los daños directos y la pérdida de personal médico calificado como consecuencia del desplazamiento forzado que enfrenta nuestro pueblo, así como a la falta de recursos, cortes de energía, escasez de combustible, falta de agua potable, alcantarillado, inundaciones, acumulación de desechos sólidos y propagación de epidemias”.\nEl Ministerio de Salud de Gaza informó el primer caso de polio la semana pasada, que atribuyó al desbordamiento de aguas residuales y a la falta de agua potable.\nDijo que “se han completado los preparativos y arreglos para la campaña de vacunación para combatir la polio, dirigida a niños menores de 10 años, y la campaña está esperando la llegada de vacunas a Gaza”.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "That Time When A Tesla Model Y Was Cheaper Than A Model 3 (That Time Is Now) [daily news updates from CleanTechnica](https://mailchi.mp/cleantechnica/daily-newsletter)on email. Or [follow us on Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLQgKIidDQklTRndnTWFoTUtFV05zWldGdWRHVmphRzVwWTJFdVkyOXRLQUFQAQ)! In the United States EV (electric vehicle) market, the “price” of a car can vary quite a bit over time. And I’m not talking about Tesla’s seemingly schizophrenic pricing policies. I’m talking about the bottom line price of an electric car, net any government incentives and rebates. In an effort to prevent climate catastrophe, many governments are incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. In the United States, these incentives are also tied to the place where a car and its components are sourced and built. In 2024, as has been widely covered, the U.S. federal government instituted some changes to the guidelines in terms of which cars qualify for the $7,500 tax credit for EVs. As of January 1, 2024, EVs need to meet more stringent geographic guidelines in manufacturing and materials origin in order to qualify for the full tax credit. The net effect is that many EVs that qualified for a tax credit in 2023 no longer qualify in 2024. For a large percentage of Americans, this means the net price of these cars went “up” by $7,500 this year. In 2023, 43 EV models were eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit. In 2024, only 19 models qualify for the full credit. To be eligible for the full credit, cars must be assembled in North America and cannot contain battery components manufactured or assembled by “foreign entities of concern.” China is currently on that “foreign entities of concern” list. So, basically, any EV with battery components made in China no longer qualifies for a tax credit. In 2024, many popular EVs no longer qualify for that $7,500 tax credit. These include the Volkswagen ID.4, the Nissan LEAF, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Chevy’s Blazer, Equinox, and Silverado EVs. The new restriction also excludes the more affordable versions of the Tesla Model 3 (Standard Range and Long Range AWD) because of their China-sourced battery components. The Model 3 Performance still meets the guidelines and qualifies for the full tax credit and can actually be [less expensive than the lower-performance AWD model](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/02/insane-mode-you-can-now-get-tesla-model-3-performance-for-less-than-tesla-model-3-long-range/) after the tax credit is considered. But one car that continues to be eligible for the full tax credit across trims is the most popular EV to date: the [Tesla Model Y](https://www.tesla.com/modely/design?referral=christopher55570&redirect=no#overview). The Model Y is similar to its little brother the Model 3 in many ways, but superior in others. The Model Y offers a higher ride height, more space, a true hatchback (vs. the Model 3’s trunk), the option for a third row of seating, and the ability to tow a trailer or camper. These advantages contributed toward the Model Y recently topping the Model 3 as the [cumulative best-selling EV in the world](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/03/tesla-model-y-passes-tesla-model-3-as-best-selling-ev-in-history/) (so far) and the [top selling vehicle model of any kind in 2023](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/28/tesla-model-y-going-to-be-top-selling-vehicle-in-the-world-in-2023/). With Tesla’s drive to increase the market penetration of electric vehicles, the company has maintained aggressive pricing. Toward the tail end of the pandemic in early 2022, when the supply chain was constricted but demand for EVs soared, the long range AWD (all-wheel-drive) Model Y peaked at $65,990. But then, as manufacturing bottlenecks eased and competition started to heat up, Tesla decreased the price of the long range Model Y to $48,990 in 2023. As of January 2024, the long range AWD Model Y is still $48,990 but the lower range rear-wheel-drive Model Y is $5,000 less: $43,990. The Model 3 compact sedan has also been lowered in price over time, but the least expensive version of that (the standard range Model 3) is currently priced at $38,990. So, while the actual price of the Model Y is $5,000 more than the Model 3, the net cost of the Model Y for many U.S buyers after the $7,500 rebate is $36,490 — that’s $2,500 less than the Model 3! So … you get more for less. How often does that happen? If you have a longer commute or simply prefer the AWD long range version of the Model Y, you will have to pay a bit more, but if you look at the current inventory vehicles (cars in stock at local stores), you can probably find a long range AWD version of the Model Y for a little over $45,000. And once you deduct that $7,500 federal rebate, you’re back down around $37,500–$38,000, which is cheaper than a new rear-wheel-drive Model 3. With local and state discounts and incentives, the price in your state may be even lower. > [Check Model Y Inventory Near You](https://www.tesla.com/inventory/new/my?arrangeby=plh&referral=christopher55570) > [Check Model 3 Inventory Near You](https://www.tesla.com/inventory/new/m3?arrangeby=plh&referral=christopher55570) So, with the most popular EV of all time now at its lowest price ever, is now the time to finally go electric? For many car buyers in 2024, it may well be.
