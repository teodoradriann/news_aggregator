    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

I wish I could respond to everyone but please know I am forever grateful.\"\nShe ended with a plea to fans to get their skin checked for cancer, adding, \"I promise you do not want to go through this.\"\nEntertainment News\nMellencamp shared her\ndiagnosis with stage two melanoma in October 2022 after doctors found an abnormal spot. Later that month, she had melanomas and her lymph nodes removed in surgery.\nHowever, doctors continued to identify cancerous spots. Three months ago, she shared that doctors biopsied yet another patch and it also came back as melanoma.\n\"I have been debating whether I should even publicly talk about this or not but then I remember how every time I post about skin cancer someone else is reminded to get checked,\" she wrote on Instagram in September. \"I can't even remember if this is the 12th or 13th one.\"\nMellencamp then began her\nimmunotherapy treatment, which aims to help the immune system fight cancerous cells. But after a month, she was disappointed with the results.\n\"Just had a big old cry,\" the reality star shared on her Instagram Story Dec. 18. \"Got the call from my doctor that the immunotherapy did not work, was not successful.\"\nAt the time, John Mellencamp's daughter noted one of her options was getting another wide excision surgery on Dec. 26 with a plastic surgeon.\n\"It's such a big area,\" she shared, \"and then just keep getting my checks every three months.\"",

    "text": "washington — First lady Jill Biden is supporting her husband, President Joe Biden, as he tries to salvage his reelection campaign after a debate performance left a growing number of members of his own party questioning his decision to stay in the race.\n“She’s his biggest supporter and champion, because she believes in him, and she fears for the future of our country if it goes the other way,” Elizabeth Alexander, the first lady's communications director, said this week. “Just as he’s always supported her career, she supports his.”\nJill Biden has been campaigning with her husband this week but also on her own at several stops.\n“For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he’s all in,” she said at each of her solo campaign stops.\n“That’s the decision he’s made. And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in, too. I know you are, too, or you wouldn’t be here today,” she told crowds in North Carolina, Florida and Georgia.\nAs first lady, Jill Biden has spearheaded initiatives for military members and their families as well as cancer treatment. As a longtime teacher, she also prioritized programs focused on education.\nShe has been involved in Joining Forces, a White House designed initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers and survivors, according to the White House website. Joining Forces focuses on projects such as improving military spouse employment and military child education. In her first two years as first lady, Biden visited 24 military installations.\nShe has also been a part of Cancer Moonshot, a program rejuvenated by the Bidens. According to its website, the project is committed to “ending cancer as we know it” by preventing more than 4 million cancer deaths by 2047. According to the American Cancer Society, a little more than 600,000 people died of cancer in 2021.\nThe goals of Cancer Moonshot include increasing access to screenings and avoiding harmful environmental exposures.\nIn addition to being the U.S. first lady, Biden is also an educator. Part of her focus while in the White House has been on academic initiatives aimed at recruiting and retaining teachers and lowering education costs.\nWhen Joe Biden became vice president under President Barack Obama, Jill Biden became the first-ever second lady to hold a paying job outside the White House. As first lady she has continued to teach writing at Northern Virginia Community College, just south of Washington, where she taught full time while her husband was vice president.\n“Many of my students don’t know that I have two jobs,” she said in 2021.\nBiden is very familiar with life in Washington, since her husband spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate and eight years as vice president under Obama.\nJoe Biden’s 2020 election victory gave Jill Biden the distinction of being the first presidential spouse to have earned a doctorate.\nDr. Biden, 73, was born in New Jersey and grew up in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia. She earned her doctorate in education from the University of Delaware.\nLife with Joe Biden was complicated from the start. She was going through a divorce. He was grieving, raising two young sons alone after his wife and baby daughter died in a car crash. Jill and Joe married, after Joe asked five times.\n“And the fifth time, I finally said to her, 'Jill, my Irish pride has gotten ahold of me. This is the last time I'm gonna ask you,” Biden said on the “Rachael Ray Show.” “I said, ‘You don't have to tell me when you will marry me, just if you'll marry me.’ She said yes.”\nFour years later, Jill gave birth to a daughter, Ashley. Tragedy would strike again in 2015 when Joe Biden’s 46-year-old son, Beau, died of brain cancer.\n“This is personal for me and my husband Joe,” she said.\nShe was the author of the 2020 children’s book Joey: The Story of Joe Biden . It was about her husband’s early years, his competitiveness and resilience after being mocked over his stutter.\nShe displayed that protective streak during a campaign rally in March 2023, using her body on two occasions to block a protester from reaching her husband on stage.\nAlthough they call the tiny Mid-Atlantic state of Delaware their home, Jill Biden has followed her husband through his career as U.S. senator, vice president and president. Now, she hopes to see him in the White House for another four years.",

    "text": "MADRID, 16 Feb. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Unión Sindical Obrera (USO), la tercera organización sindical más importante de Colombia, ha señalado que comparte la visión general del Gobierno de Colombia a la hora de transformar la petrolera Ecopetrol en una empresa nacional de energías limpias.\nEn un comunicado, el sindicato ha expresado que defiende los proyectos del Gobierno que \"con orgullo\" han ayudado a elegir y ha apuntado con claridad que Ecopetrol \"debe\" jugar un papel como eje de la transición energética en Colombia que resultará justa para la vida.\nEl sindicato ha mostrado su plena disposición tras un discurso pronunciado el pasado martes por el presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, en el que el mandatario animó a transformar Ecopetrol en una industria más limpia, haciendo una transición hacia el uso de fuentes de energía más renovables como el hidrógeno verde, y que cuente con una gerencia obrera en lugar de una jerárquica como la actual.\n\"El mundo del petróleo es moribundo, y su gran triunfo empieza a tambalear, pero se puede llenar de seguridad si la gerencia actual de Ecopetrol democratizara a la empresa, no esas jerarquías, ingenieros de altos salarios, altísimos\", denunció Petro.\nPara la USO, estas palabras fueron emocionantes y han insuflado ánimo a poner su experiencia, sus afiliados y su conocimiento a disposición de Ecopetrol para que se convierta en una empresa que ayude con responsabilidad en defensa de la soberanía energética y desde los principios de sostenibilidad y rigor.\nIgualmente, el sindicato ha sostenido que la transformación de Ecopetrol requiere cambios profundos en el modelo gerencial para que sea menos vertical e incluya a los trabajadores en la gestión de la petrolera \"de todos los colombianos y colombianas\".\n\"La USO ha sido clara siempre en decir que comparte esa visión de cambio propuesta por el Gobierno del Cambio y la concertación de una ruta para la transición energética juta que proteja el empleo en el sector y mantenga de manera paralela la exploración, producción comercialización de petróleo y gas\", ha concluido el sindicato.\nLeer más acerca de: Colombia sindicatos",
