    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- PR Newswire) American Tinnitus Association Terry and Marlo outside Texas Roadhouse in Murfreesboro, TN. VIENNA,Va., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The AmericanTinnitus Association is honored to announce the incredible success of the third annual Tinnitus Awareness Day dine-to-donate event hosted by Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33 on February 5. The charitable event, held in memory of Texas Roadhouse founder Kent Taylor, who had severe tinnitus, raised $925,000 for ATA. This is the largest corporate donation the association has received to date. Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33 are committed to raising awareness of tinnitus because of Kent's experience and the reality that few people consider tinnitus and its varied effects until they are affected by it. \"We are proud to partner with ATA to raise money and bring attention to tinnitus. Thank you to all of our employees and guests across the country who made this event a success. This fundraiser was held in honor of our founder, Kent Taylor, and in hopes that we will help find relief for those suffering with tinnitus,\" said Texas Roadhouse CEO Jerry Morgan. ATA is the only U.S. nonprofit dedicated exclusively to improving tinnitus patient care by providing individualized nonmedical guidance, initiating educational programs for the public and healthcare communities, and funding innovative research to find cures and better treatments for the condition. \"Tinnitus is a common condition that is poorly understood among the public and even within the healthcare community,\" said Jinsheng Zhang , chair of the ATA board of directors, \"which is why having a nationwide fundraiser hosted by Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33 gives me hope for a future with less tinnitus suffering through better understanding of tinnitus, development of effective treatments, and strong patient support services.\" Tinnitus is caused by many factors, including exposure to loud sound, certain infections, stress, particular medications, and even traumatic brain injury, which means it's a heterogenous condition that lacks clear guidelines for patient care. \"People are astonished to learn that most types of tinnitus cannot be cured,\" Dr. Zhang added. \"As a researcher, it's clear that eliminating tinnitus is complicated, but scientists and clinicians in the field are making progress in identifying subtypes and improving interventions that may suppress it or at least make it more manageable for people living with moderate to severe tinnitus.\" Tinnitus research has advanced significantly in the last 50 years, but far more work is needed to discover possible pharmaceutical interventions and better understand the mechanisms that underlie tinnitus, particularly severe tinnitus, which affects approximately 1 percent of the estimated 26 million adults living with the condition in the U.S. \"Through the extraordinary generosity of Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33, as well as the many people who turned out to support the event, ATA is able to restructure and expand its Innovative Tinnitus Research Grants Program to cultivate not only new areas of investigation but also attract new researchers to the field,\" Dr. Zhang said. The gift also better positions ATA to achieve its goal of being the first place that people with tinnitus, or questions about it, turn for help. \"There's so much misinformation on the internet as well as incorrect and even harmful information that is given by healthcare providers to individuals desperate for answers about this unwanted and often intrusive sound,\" said Sara K. Downs , ATA interim executive director. Downs is also an audiologist specialized in tinnitus management. \"ATA is the only place you can go free of charge to receive unbiased information and credible educational guidance on tinnitus. Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33 are helping to ensure that ATA can deliver on its mission to educate the public and healthcare professionals,\" she said. Coinciding with the February 5 dine-to-donate event, which launched Tinnitus Awareness Week, ATA began accepting applications for research grants. \"ATA supports investigators of all career stages whose work advances understanding of tinnitus effects, and who remain dedicated to chipping away at the need to develop interventions with potential to support the substantive needs of diverse tinnitus patient subgroups,\" saidMarc Fagelson , ATA Scientific Advisory Committee chair. Applications will be accepted from now untilApril 26, 2024. About ATA's Innovative Tinnitus Research Grants Program ATA grants support novel investigations aimed at contributing substantively to the scientific understanding of tinnitus and improving patient care and quality of life for those affected by tinnitus. By supporting innovative research, ATA contributes to the discovery of potential breakthroughs that advance scientific understanding of tinnitus and improve quality-of-life outcomes for people suffering from tinnitus. Applications should be submitted viaProposalCentral . Submission instructionscan be found here .

If you or a loved one need information or help managing tinnitus, contact ATA at 800-634-8978 or visit ata . About Tinnitus Tinnitus affects approximately one in 10 individuals worldwide. Despite its prevalence, there is no cure for most types of chronic tinnitus, and most physicians receive little training in its management. The most common causes of tinnitus, which can present as buzzing, ringing, whooshing, and a range of other sounds, are exposure to loud noise, age-related hearing loss, earwax blockage, head and neck trauma, cardiovascular disorders, neurological conditions, and stress and anxiety. Even though most tinnitus cases cannot be cured, a range of interventions can often help manage its negative impact. Because each individual experiences tinnitus differently and the causes of tinnitus are so varied, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for its management.If you need guidance on tinnitus or finding an appropriate healthcare provider, contact ATA at 800-634-8978 or email[email protected] .

AI has been used in Google ads for quite some time now. First, it was used for keywords, then automatic bidding and now it is being used for placing automotive creatives. The top goal of 72% marketers in 2024 is to achieve large growth and the aim to increase their ad spend efficiently to target ROAS and CPA. Marketers want to reduce their wasted spend, prioritize the safety of consumers and optimize the performance other than the ad accounts. One in five marketers say that they are not able to increase their ad budget so they have to efficiently make the best out of their existing budget.\nOn the other hand, advertising budgets are increasing and 12 out of 23 campaigns are expecting an increase in their ad budgets on Google Ads and Meta Platforms. 63% of the experts have chosen Google’s Performance Max Campaign for increased budget issuance.

    "text": "A Texas SWAT team demolished the cab of an 18-wheeler truck with a bulletproof digger in order to pluck the driver out after he led them on an hours-long slow car-chase.\nShocking video shows the moment that a seven feet tall bulletproof vehicle, known as 'The Rook', tore apart the cab of a tractor trailer.\nThe Rook effortlessly ripped through the 18-wheeler's exterior and tore the door of the cab right off so that members of the Texas SWAT team could yank the driver out.\nDeputies had been forced to bring the massive truck to a stop by using spike strips to puncture its tires.\nThe dramatic measure came after the truck's driver - later identified as Trinidad Cutshall - repeatedly ignored the officials' commands to exit and continued to rev the truck's engines as it drove down a highway east of Houston.\nAfter the tractor trailer had finally been forced to a halt, the digger ripped an initial hole in the cab which allowed the SWAT team to throw an unknown item into the vehicle.\nThe SWAT members then let one of their dogs into the truck before ripping Cutshall out.\nAccording to officials - Cutshall continued to press the gas and hold on inside the cab as officers desperately tried to drag him out.\nEventually - at around 4 pm on Wednesday - the man was plucked from the cab and officers walked towards the bloodied man with a stretcher.\nCutshall's worrying behavior came after an already alarming hours-long car chase, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said.\nGonzalez said the driver appeared to be suffering from 'heavy impairment,' but that authorities don't know what was behind his behavior.\n'Still don't know why he was reacting in the erratic manner he was,' Gonzalez said.",

    "title": "Biden, Nato pledge fresh Ukraine aid, membership - World - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden and leaders of other Nato member states are set to announce new aid and stress a membership pledge for [Ukraine](https://www.dawn.com/news/1838749) at a summit in Washington after Biden promised to defend Kyiv against the Russian invasion. As Biden welcomed Nato leaders, the United States and Germany announced that the US would start deploying longer-range missiles in Germany in 2026 in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to Nato and European defence. A joint US-German statement said the “episodic deployments” were in preparation for longer-term stationing of such capabilities that would include SM-6, Tomahawk and developmental hypersonic weapons with a greater range than current capabilities in Europe. A draft communique prepared for the meeting of the 32-nation alliance said the allies intend to provide Ukraine with minimum funding of 40 billion euros ($43.28bn) in military aid within the next year, but stopped short of the multi-year commitment Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sought. Alliance begins sending F-16 jets to Kyiv The draft, seen by Reuters, also strengthened past Nato language on China, calling it a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security. Nato allies announced on Wednesday they had started the long-promised transfer of F-16 jets to Ukraine. The White House followed up by saying that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending F-16 jets to Ukraine. Norwegian premier Jonas Gahr Store said at the Nato summit that Norway will begin delivering six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine later this year. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer “concentrates Vladimir Putin’s mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us and, if he persists, the damage that will continue to be done to Russia and its interests will only deepen”. “The quickest way to get to peace is through a strong Ukraine,” Blinken said. Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that Nato was “stronger than it’s ever been” and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian President Vladimir Putin “with our full, collective support”. However, November’s US presidential election could presage a sharp change in Washington’s support for Ukraine and Nato. Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion, and US support for allies generally. Biden, 81, has faced questions about his [fitness for office](https://www.dawn.com/news/1844429/biden-tries-to-ease-democrats-worries-about-his-candidacy) after fumbling a June 27 debate and hopes the Nato spotlight will help him stage a comeback of sorts, surrounded by allied leaders he has spent his three years in office cultivating. Uncertainty about US leadership has unsettled Nato allies. “If there’s one thing that I’m concerned about with the United States, it’s the polarisation of the political climate — it is, I have to admit, very toxic,” Alexander Stubb, president of new Nato ally Finland, told reporters on Wednesday. “But when I meet 15 senators, as I just did at the Senate, there’s strong bipartisan support for Ukraine and also for Nato.” While Biden has been seeking to rally allies and domestic support, several high-ranking European officials met a top foreign policy adviser to Trump during the summit.

    "text": "China experienced its hottest month on record in July, with the highest average temperature since the country began releasing comprehensive data in 1961, the China Meteorological Administration said on Thursday.\nJia Xiaolong, deputy director of the National Climate Center, said the national average temperature hit a record 23.2 C last month, 1.1 C higher than in the previous hottest July dating back to 1961.\n\"In July, China encountered a combination of extreme heavy rainfall and extreme high temperatures nationwide,\" Jia said at a news conference in Beijing.\nSouthern China faced a widespread and prolonged heat wave in July, with multiple regions experiencing continuous high temperatures for over 20 days.\nA total of 59 national meteorological stations recorded daily maximum temperatures that broke or hit historical records.\nTemperatures above 41 C were observed in places like Cili in Hunan province, Tongshan in Hubei province and Lishui in Zhejiang province, Jia said.\nHot weather records were shattered around the world last month, with July 22 being Earth's hottest day on record as the global daily average temperature reached 17.15 C.\nThe sudden rise in average daily temperature from July 21 to 22 was mainly due to significantly higher than average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe, as well as most of Antarctica, Jia said.\nAccording to forecasts, temperatures in most parts of China will remain higher than usual this month.\nTwo significant heat waves will hit in the first half of August, and the high temperatures are expected to ease late in the month, the CMA said.\nIn July, national average precipitation was 140 millimeters, 15 percent more than in the same period in previous years and the third highest since 1961.\nThe previous two records, when the country was hit by catastrophic floods, were 148 mm in July 1996 and 146.8 mm in July 1998.\nFrequent heavy rains battered a large expanse of China from north to south last month, with the provinces of Shandong and Jilin receiving their highest precipitation since 1961.\nDaily precipitation records were broken at 33 national meteorological stations. Among them, Sheqi in Henan province, Hengshan in Hunan province and Pingyi in Shandong saw daily precipitation exceed 300 mm.\nJia said the rainy season in North China began on July 22, and on July 30 Beijing experienced its most intense rainfall since the start of flood season.\nLocal authorities urged extra efforts to prevent secondary disasters such as floods and landslides, he said.\nA total of 2,492 red alerts were issued nationwide in July, an 84 percent increase compared to the average for the month in the previous seven years, he added. Two-thirds of the red alerts were for heavy rain.\nzhaoyimeng@chinadaily.com.cn\nRelated news Temperatures top 40 C in northern regions\n2024-06-11 May temperatures rise across China\n2024-06-05",

    "title": "Tesla opens 3 new supercharger sites with 17 fast chargers",
    "text": "Tesla has been delivering EV fast charging infrastructure in Australia longer than any other company. With the strong rise in EV uptake over the past few years, there has been an acceleration in the number of new sites coming online. Now the company has opened its next round of sites across three states, adding 17 new fast chargers and bringing the total number of commissioned sites to 93. Starting in Queensland, Tesla has opened an 8-stall V3 supercharger site in Springwood, Queensland. This site is located in a shopping centre car park south of Brisbane. Each charger at the site is capable of delivering 250 kW of DC fast charging with many charging stalls tucked away next to a wall. This week, Tesla shared this site as the supercharger on its Tesla Charging X page. As of the writing of this article, this site is currently open to only Tesla vehicles and charging is priced at 56 c/kWh. New Tesla Supercharger: Springwood, QLD, Australia (8 stalls) [https://t.co/cS3tDDA4ga] [pic.twitter.com/yPpUIf89An] — Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) [July 17, 2024] Travelling south to NSW, earlier in the month, Tesla opened a 6-stall V4 supercharger site in the town of Griffith. This site is open to non-Tesla EVs as well with longer cables allowing ease of reaching the charge port on other EVs. Pricing at this site is set to 68 c/kWh for Tesla EVs and for non-Tesla EVs it’s increased to 92 c/kWh. Heading further south into Victoria, a 3-stall V3 supercharger site is now opened in the town of Kerang which is 280 km northwest of Melbourne. The site itself is located next to the IGA supermarket and other amenities in the area. Tesla also shared the opening of this site on the Tesla Charging X page. New Tesla Supercharger: Kerang, VIC, Australia (3 stalls) [https://t.co/hgqOC1oJTB] [pic.twitter.com/eWL4rvfYT2] — Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) [July 15, 2024] As seen in recent weeks, multiple sites across the country have come online while others are nearing completion. Many of these sites will see good utilisation during the coming months, particularly during the summer months. News of these sites comes only days after it was reported in The Driven that Australia has reached a major milestone [with over 1,000 fast-charging sites](https://thedriven.io/2024/07/12/major-milestone-australia-now-has-more-than-1000-fast-charging-sites/) now online across the country. With Tesla continuing its rollout of superchargers in Australia and other networks also contributing to the national rollout, it gives confidence to current owners and future EV drivers that they can road trip in an EV easier than ever. Riz is the founder of [carloop](https://carloop.com.au/) based in Melbourne, specialising in Australian EV data, insight reports and trends. He is a mechanical engineer who spent the first 7 years of his career building transport infrastructure before starting carloop. He has a passion for cars, particularly EVs and wants to help reduce transport emissions in Australia. He currently drives a red Tesla Model 3.",
