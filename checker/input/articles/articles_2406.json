    "title": "&lsquo;Deva&rsquo; Movie Review: A Watered Down Remake of Rosshan Andrrews&rsquo; &lsquo;Mumbai Police&rsquo; Almost Redeemed",
    "text": "Deva Movie Review: Like any Mallu, I have seen Mumbai Police, the original version of this week's Hindi remake, the Shahid Kapoor-starrer Deva, and I apologise if I end up comparing them. It's hard to switch off the part of your brain that remembers details about the original movie when watching a remake, constantly wondering, 'Did the original do it better?' and the answer, unfortunately for the remake, is always affirmative. ‘Deva’ Movie Review: Netizens Impressed by Shahid Kapoor’s Cop Avatar, Laud the Actioner Co-Starring Pooja Hegde!\nWell, Deva isn't a complete adaptation of Mumbai Police. Even though both films are directed by Rosshan Andrrews, creative liberties have been taken with the original screenplay (by Sanjay-Bobby) to adapt it to a Bollywood milieu, including altering the big twist. Despite four new writers (Abbas Dalal, Hussain Dalal, Arshad Syed, and Sumit Arora) coming on board, Deva feels like a watered-down version of Mumbai Police that doesn’t quite stick the new landing.\nDev Ambre (Shahid Kapoor) is a trigger-happy cop who disregards rules, leads with brutality against criminals, and would risk his life for his friends. His disdain for authority is so extreme that he neither wears a uniform on duty nor a helmet while riding his bike. If only he had heeded the disclaimer on screen about wearing a helmet, perhaps he wouldn't have lost his memory in a poorly shot accident. Also, someone please let me know where I can buy the earbuds Dev uses in that scene - not only do they stay in his ears, but they also manage to capture conversations so perfectly, even when he's speeding through a tunnel.\nWatch the Trailer of 'Deva':\nBefore the accident, Dev was investigating the murder of a fellow cop who was sniped at a commemoration ceremony. Just before the accident, he called his senior, Farhan (Pravesh Rana), to reveal that he had solved the case. After the crash, Dev loses all memory, including of himself, but retains his intellect and skills. This prompts Farhan - who is also his brother-in-law - to instruct him to solve the case again, without letting anyone know about his memory loss. Whether Dev manages to crack the case again forms the rest of the story.\n‘Deva’ Movie Review - Shahid Kapoor Shines\nThe cleverest thing about Deva is perhaps its title. Why name the movie Deva when the character is called Dev? If you’re a Mumbai Police fan, you might remember Anthony Moses - A and Anthony Moses - B. Now you get it? So we have Dev-B investigating what Dev-A had already uncovered. The first half spends considerable time establishing Dev-A’s rebellious attitude, which works in parts, mostly because Shahid Kapoor excels in mass-appeal scenes. You simply can’t ignore the energy and swagger he brings to the role - even if Prithviraj Sukumaran still delivered a superior performance in the original - especially in the “Bhasad Macha” song, the action sequences or when he confronts an arrogant politician (Gireesh Kulkarni).\nI also appreciated the filmmakers shooting in real Mumbai locations, lending authenticity to the narrative. However, some scenes betray obvious green-screen backgrounds, which feel jarring.\n‘Deva’ Movie Review - How The Remake Pulls Off Its Changes\nCompared to Mumbai Police, Deva incorporates several changes to make it feel different. The film glorifies Dev’s underhanded actions as a cop, a staple in Hindi cinema, but one I hoped would be subverted here. The original did this effectively, showing how Anthony Moses-B was horrified by his former self’s brutality. I waited for something similar, but while Dev-B is tamer than Dev-A, there’s a moment where he beats up a couple of people - and his boss gleefully exclaims, “That’s the Dev I was waiting for!” If the original critically examined the protagonist’s problematic behaviour, including his misogyny, Deva glosses over these flaws in the 'mass'-lighting of the protagonist.\nDev’s friendship with fellow cop Rohan (Pavail Gulati) also sees some changes. This time, they’ve been friends since childhood, though their dynamic remains largely the same - Rohan faces ridicule from his affluent family for becoming a cop, while Dev acts as his protective guardian. As in the Malayalam film (where Jayasurya played the part), their friendship is the movie’s emotional core, which is clearly lacking in the forced and rushed romantic subplot between Dev and Disha (the film isn’t even clear on when they started hooking up).\nThe introduction of a new character, Pooja Hegde’s Disha, ensures that Deva doesn’t follow Mumbai Police to the same conclusion. This initially intrigued me - I was curious about what the big reveal would be here (not the culprit, but rather the motive behind the crime). Unfortunately, within two scenes of Disha’s entry, the reason became obvious. From there, I was just waiting for the movie to plod along to its predictable conclusion. The investigation sequences in the second half lack energy, and even Upendra Limaye’s cameo (playing Riyaz Khan’s role from the original) doesn’t help, especially with the crass lines given to him. Shahid Kapoor’s Underrated Performances: Ahead of ‘Deva’, Check Out Actor’s 5 Overlooked Roles and Where To Watch the Movies Online.\n‘Deva’ Movie Review - The New Twist Feels Weak\nSo how does the new twist work in the remake? When Mumbai Police was released in 2013, it was praised for its bold and shocking reveal. However, in 2025, some now criticise the twist for being problematic, particularly regarding Jayasurya’s character’s reaction to the revelation. That said, the original’s twist made sense in the context of a character known to preen his hypermasculinity and his need to keep a secret. It also doesn't help that Malayalam Cinema and even Bollywood has become much more progressive with those themes.\nSo the makers had two ways to go. Either improve upon the circumstances that make the shock twist less problematic or go for a different but better twist.\nHere, the altered twist feels, for lack of a better word… lame. It isn’t mind-blowing, and it also makes you feel like the filmmakers didn't dare to take a bold route. Instead, they settled for a far less compelling shock factor. This is made even more discordant by the fact that the murder victim is depicted as forgiving of the culprit, which makes no sense given what the killer has done. Which makes you wonder - why even go for this remake then if you had to water down the USP of the original movie?\nEven though the screenplay is highly inconsistent, one thing remains solid: Shahid Kapoor’s performance. While he is decent as the amnesiac Dev-B, Shahid truly shines as the boisterous, roguish Dev-A, high on swag and energy. He is particularly impressive in the scene where he defends his actions before his friend.\nPooja Hegde doesn’t have much to do besides being a forced love interest and a plot device to signal where the film is heading. Pavail Gulati is quite good as the mild-mannered Rohan, especially in his speech scene and a third-act confrontation. Pravesh Rana is fine as the supportive superior. Kubbra Sait is wasted.\n‘Deva’ Movie Review - Final Thoughts\nDeva lacks the depth and impact of Mumbai Police, failing to fully capitalise on the potential of its subversive storytelling. While Shahid Kapoor’s performance and some well-shot sequences elevate the film, the diluted screenplay and underwhelming twist make it an utterly inconsequential remake.\n(The opinions expressed in the above article are of the author and do not reflect the stand or position of LatestLY.)\n(The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jan 31, 2025 02:09 PM IST.

    "text": "What You Need To Know:\nThis movie is non-stop action and very moral. Two minor characters explicitly quote from Scripture. One minor character, who is loading priceless Bosch paintings into a truck outside a city museum declares that the paintings are priceless because they deal with “man’s inclination to sin, in defiance of God’s will. ” Another man tells a fireman that “Matthew 7:26 is his favorite verse, because it deals with a man building his house on sand.” Movies don’t get much more redemptive than this. VOLCANO is an inspiring, exciting picture well worth the price of theatrical admission although it is marred by some scurrilous language\nContent:\n(B, CC, LL, V,O) Biblical worldview with heroic overtones & Christian elements; 13 obscenities & 7 profanities; men burned to death, man expires in lava flow, & multiple car accidents; no sex; no nudity; no drinking; no smoking; and, radio references to astrology.\nMore Detail:\n1997 is the year for volcano pictures in Hollywood, and between DANTE’S PEAK and VOLCANO, VOLCANO is by far the most exciting and inspiring. Under Director Mick Jackson’s able direction, the film explodes onto the screen with 95 minutes of nearly non-stop action, documenting a volcano in downtown LA at the start, climax and aftermath of its eruption.\nVOLCANO starts with a fast-paced montage of LA life, including suspenseful shots of lava flowing underground unbeknownst to the city dwellers above. Reprising a role very similar to the one he played in 1994’s FUGITIVE, Tommy Lee Jones (who plays LA Office of Emergency Management [OEM] Chief Mike Roark) comes on to the scene to examine a strange geological event. Seven Metro Rail workers have been mysteriously burned to death, as they toil on a subway tunnel underneath Los Angeles’ famous La Brea Tar Pits, one of the city’s most renowned natural tourist attractions. Deputy Chief Emmit Reese (Don Cheadle) discovers that the Metro Rail officials, fearing public panic, are covering up the cause of these deaths. As the men are treated at the emergency room of a hospital, a major earthquake strikes.\nCut to attractive Cal Tech seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche), who is called to the scene by OEM. She finds more perplexing data in the La Brea Tar Pits pond and reports to Roark that only a geologic event could have caused 1 million gallons of water to rise 6 degrees in temperature within one day. Needless to say, the early morning eruption catches millions of city residents unaware. Will Mike Roark be able to save his daughter Kelly from death as the city is brutalized by the volcano’s destructive fury, unleashing more energy than several nuclear bombs?\nHang on to your seats; this movie moves fast. It also contains several redemptive sub-plots, lifting it above the run-of-the-mill disaster movie and qualify it for accolades among Christian viewing audiences. No less than three minor characters heroically offer their lives to save other unfortunates from the effects of the well-orchestrated disaster, including Metro Transit Authority Chief Stan Olber (John Lynch), who initially refuses to stop the subway cars under the La Brea Tar Pits but redeems himself by heroically losing his life to save the life of an unconscious Metro driver, trapped in a burning car.\nMoreover, the script includes two instances of minor characters explicitly quoting Scripture to one another. One minor character, who is loading priceless Hieronymus Bosch paintings into a truck outside a city museum to escape the approaching lava declares that Bosch’s paintings are priceless because they deal with “man’s inclination to sin, in defiance of God’s will.” Another man tells a fireman that “Matthew 7:26 is his favorite verse, because it deals with a man building his house on sand.” Movies don’t get much more redemptive than this.\nVOLCANO is set apart from DANTE’S PEAK by its outrageous premise that an volcano would actually erupt in mid-town Los Angeles, threatening thousands of people and structures. The writers and the director employed some very captivating scientific fictions which, by their own testimony, caused many jaded Angelenos in the press screening to accept its outrageous premise. Many viewers living outside Los Angeles will find this film equally captivating, although not as frightening, since perhaps only Los Angeles residents fear both earthquakes and geologic eruptions at the same time.\nLaden with extravagant special effects, including the apparent blowing up of several downtown office buildings and amazingly dramatic pyrotechnic displays, VOLCANO is an inspiring picture well worth the price of admission although it is marred by some scurrilous language.\n ",

    "text": "Relatório das Nações Unidas publicado nesta quinta-feira (28) lamentou o que disse ser uma “rápida deterioração” dos\ndireitos humanos na Cisjordânia ocupada por Israel e pediu às autoridades israelenses que acabem com a violência contra a população palestina no local.\nO relatório, publicado pelo Escritório do Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Direitos Humanos (Acnudh), informou que 300 palestinos foram mortos na Cisjordânia desde 7 de outubro, o dia em que atiradores do Hamas realizaram o ataque mortal no sul de Israel e levaram reféns para Gaza. A maioria das mortes ocorreu durante operações das forças de segurança israelenses ou em confrontos com elas.\nPelo menos 105 mortes podem ser atribuídas a operações israelenses envolvendo ataques aéreos ou outras táticas militares em campos de refugiados ou outras áreas densamente povoadas. Pelo menos oito pessoas foram mortas por colonos judeus, segundo o relatório. Não houve nenhum comentário imediato das autoridades israelenses sobre o relatório. Israel afirma que suas operações na Cisjordânia são preventivas e têm como objetivo conter as ameaças à segurança.\n“O uso de meios táticos e armas militares em contextos de segurança, o uso de força desnecessária ou desproporcional e a aplicação de restrições de movimento amplas, arbitrárias e discriminatórias que afetam os palestinos são extremamente preocupantes”, disse o alto comissário da ONU para Direitos Humanos, Volker Turk.\n“Peço a Israel que tome medidas imediatas, claras e eficazes para pôr fim à violência dos colonos contra a população palestina, para investigar todos os incidentes de violência por parte dos colonos e das forças de segurança israelenses, para garantir a proteção efetiva das comunidades palestinas.”\nO Acnudh disse que também registrou detenções arbitrárias em massa, detenções ilegais e casos de tortura e outras formas de maus-tratos relatados contra detidos palestinos. Afirmou que cerca de 4.785 palestinos foram detidos na Cisjordânia desde 7 de outubro.\n“Alguns foram despidos, vendados e mantidos presos por longas horas com algemas e com as pernas amarradas, enquanto os soldados israelenses pisavam em suas cabeças e costas, eram cuspidos, jogados contra paredes, ameaçados, insultados, humilhados e, em alguns casos, submetidos à violência sexual e de gênero”, disse o Acnudh.\nA Cisjordânia já vinha experimentando os níveis mais altos de agitação em décadas durante os 18 meses que antecederam o ataque a Israel em 7 de outubro por homens armados do Hamas, mas os confrontos aumentaram acentuadamente quando Israel lançou uma invasão terrestre em Gaza.",

    "text": "Esta semana X ha sufrido un descalabro importante con la migración masiva de cientos de miles de usuarios a Bluesky . Y es que en las últimas 24 horas se han registrado más de un millón de usuarios en la nueva 'Twitter' según mantiene la red social desde su cuenta oficial.\nEl nombramiento de Elon Musk por parte de Donald Trump para un puesto de liderazgo en el gobierno ha sido la gota que ha colmado el vaso para muchos, y en estos días atrás Bluesky se ha convertido en el destino ideal de miles de usuarios que usaban diariamente X.\nEste hecho también ha propiciado que el medio británico The Guardian tome una importante decisión que también puede lastrar a otros: ha eliminado su cuenta oficial en X al tratarlo como una plataforma mediática tóxica . Una descripción que recoge perfectamente el desencanto que se ha producido con X en estos dos últimos años después de que fuera adquirida por Elon Musk por 44.000 millones de dólares .\nit's official — 1,000,000 people have joined Bluesky in just the last day!!! welcome and thank you for being here 🥳\n[image or embed]\n— Bluesky ( @bsky.app ) 15 de noviembre de 2024, 1:53 La cada vez más grande bola de nieve en la forma de un movimiento migratorio digital hacia Bluesky desde X no comenzó a labrarse esta misma semana, sino que otra decisión de X en octubre —unas semanas antes de las elecciones de Estados Unidos y relacionada con el bloqueo de usuarios — propició que muchos hicieran las maletas y comenzasen con este desplazamiento a la red social con el icono de la mariposa.\nEl entusiasmo de Bluesky ante la llegada masiva de usuarios nuevos no solo se debe a la cifra de nuevos registros, sino también por un importante dato, y que seguro miran con envidia desde Threads de Meta , ya que importantes figuras de medios deportivos estadounidenses, tal como recoge Awful Announcing , como ESPN, Maedowlark Media, FS1, The Athletic o The Ringer también están 'mudándose'.\nManuel Ramírez El Androide Libre\nQué es Bluesky, la red social a la que más de un millón de usuarios ha migrado después de decir adiós a X y Elon Musk Una red social de este tipo necesita este tipo de figuras al igual que de marcas para que muchos usuarios puedan leer sus 'tuits' directamente como una fuente de información directa, al igual que lo ha sido X en todo este tiempo pasado.\nEl momento de felicidad lo está viviendo ahora mismo Bluesky para pasar de los 6 millones de usuarios a los 15 millones en los últimos 90 días , e incluso llevar su app a la más descargada en la App Store esta misma semana. Queda lejos todavía de los 335 millones de usuarios activos en X, pero según Similarweb , 115.000 usuarios web desactivaron sus cuentas en X después del día de las elecciones estadounidenses.\nLooking at the replies on an app and not seeing porn bots or people calling me DEI\n[image or embed]\n— Minakimes ( @minakimes.bsky.social ) 12 de noviembre de 2024, 23:53 Adam Mosseri, director de Threads, también ha compartido que han recibido más de 15 millones de registros solo en noviembre , aunque la alternativa a X de Meta está muy vinculada a Instagram y le está costando recoger el 'favor' de las marcas.
