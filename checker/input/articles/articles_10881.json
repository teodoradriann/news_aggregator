    "title": "美债风暴前一个月，美国海外债主持有的美债创2021年6月来最大增幅_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "下载新浪财经APP，了解全球实时汇率\n　　来源：华尔街见闻\n　　美东时间4月16日周三，美国财政部公布国际资本流动报告（TIC）显示， 今年2月美国的海外债主们持有的美国国债显著增长，为2021年6月以来的最大增幅。 加拿大和日本是该月净买入量位居前列的国家， 而该月正值美债市场近期动荡的前夕。\n　　截至今年2月末，美国以外国家持有的美国国债总额增加2900亿美元，达到创纪录的8.82万亿美元。当月，外国买家净购买了1062亿美元的长期美债和732亿美元的短期美债。\n　　 日本2月所持美国国债增加466亿美元，是自2020年2月以来的最大增幅， 至1.13万亿美元，为2024年4月以来的最高水平。自2019年6月持仓超越中国大陆以来，日本一直是美国国债最大的海外持有国。\n　　华尔街见闻网站此前提到，去年日本的美债持仓变动，一度被视为干预汇市压力下的调整。为了稳定日元汇率采取的干预需要日本掌握充足“弹药”，因此不得不减持包括美债在内的美元资产筹资。例如，有媒体援引数据称，去年7月日本投入366亿美元干预汇市。不过，去年8月和9月，日元兑美元强劲反弹，日本政府暂时没有支持日元的需求，失去了抛美债的一大动力。\n　　 中国大陆2月所持美债增加235亿美元，至7843亿美元。 当月中国净卖出了48亿美元的长期美国国债，同时净买入了151亿美元的短期国债。整体持有量的增长也部分反映了2月美国国债价格的上涨。\n　　从2022年4月起，中国大陆的美债持仓一直低于1万亿美元，截至今年2月，仍是仅次于日本的第二大美债持有国家地区。大体来说，中国大陆的美债持仓增加的月份与当月美债价格上涨吻合。\n　　分析普遍认为，鉴于中美关系变化和外储资产配置多元化的趋势，中国的美国国债持仓仍可能稳步下降。未来中国持仓的波动很大程度上仍受中美关系影响。\n　　近年来，中国大陆减持美债更多来自外储资产多元化配置的需要，提升黄金配置占比就是促进多元化配置的一种体现。截至去年4月，中国央行曾创纪录地连续18个月增持黄金，此后一度暂时收手，不过近来又恢复购入黄金的操作。本月稍早公布的数据显示，3月末 中国黄金 储备为7370万盎司，较2月末的7361万盎司增加9万盎司，这是自2024年11月以来，中国央行连续第五个月增持黄金储备。\n　　加拿大在1月净卖出美债后，2月美债持仓大幅反弹，净买入465亿美元的长期美债。有分析人士指出，今年1月，美国总统特朗普向加拿大施压，目前双边紧张局势进一步加剧。\n　　英国是第三大美债海外债主，2月持有量增加了101亿美元，达7503亿美元。\n　　开曼群岛（被认为是对冲基金等杠杆投资者的热门注册地）2月美债持有量增加了133亿美元，达到4178亿美元。市场人士表示，近期美国国债市场的波动部分源于对冲基金解除所谓的“基差交易”策略。\n　　周三的数据还显示，阿联酋今年前两个月的美债持仓大幅增加近430亿美元，总额达到1199亿美元，几乎是去年1月时的两倍。\n　　 分析称，最新的TIC数据反映了特朗普宣布大规模加征关税约一个月前，外国投资者对美债的强烈需求。在其4月2日宣布关税措施后，29万亿美元的美国国债市场遭遇了自2001年以来最严重的抛售。\n　　未来几个月的TIC数据将被密切关注，以判断各国是否正在减少美债持有量。虽然4月的美债持仓数据要等到6月才会公布，但部分市场参与者对此说法持怀疑态度。从长期趋势看，外国投资者在美国国债市场中的占比已经从2008年超过一半的峰值下降，彭博汇编数据显示，近年来该占比约为30%。\n　　美国财政部的TIC数据还显示：\n2月份，包括长期证券、美国短期证券、以及银行资金流的所有外资净流入总额为2847亿美元。 其中，私人外资净流入为2293亿美元，官方外资净流入为554亿美元。 2月份，外国居民增持了美国长期证券，净买入规模为1427亿美元。其中，外国私人投资者的净买入为1661亿美元，而外国官方机构则净卖出234亿美元。 美国居民在1月份增持了长期外国证券，净买入规模为307亿美元。 经过调整后，例如估计外国投资组合通过股票互换收购美国股票，1月份外国对长期证券的净卖出总额估计为1120亿美元。 外国居民增持了短期证券美国国库券732亿美元。外国居民持有的所有以美元计价的短期美国证券和其他托管负债增加了799亿美元。 银行自身对外国居民的以美元计价的净负债增加了928亿美元。 　　美国财政部今年3月的TIC数据，定于2025年5月16日发布。\n　　风险提示及免责条款\n　　市场有风险，投资需谨慎。本文不构成个人投资建议，也未考虑到个别用户特殊的投资目标、财务状况或需要。用户应考虑本文中的任何意见、观点或结论是否符合其特定状况。据此投资，责任自负。",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Ham & High",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "COP28 agrees to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" and calls on all countries to share the sense of crisis and agree to further emissions reductions | Stories | Science Japan",
    "text": "The summer of 2023 was announced as the \"hottest summer on record,\" with abnormal weather conditions believed to be the result of global warming becoming more frequent around the world, causing damage from heat waves, droughts, torrential rains, and other events. The 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), began November 30 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and was extended by one day. On December 13, the conference concluded with the adoption of an agreement explicitly stating that \"transition away from fossil fuels should be accelerated within the decade\" to limit the temperature increase to within 1.5 ℃ from the pre-industrial era—in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Progress was made by expanding the scope from the \"phase-out of coal-fired power generation,\" agreed to in past conferences, to encompass all fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, upon which the world has relied as its energy sources. The agreed outcome document also included a commitment to triple the global installed capacity (power generation capability) for renewable energy by 2030. Negotiations during the conference faced challenges owing to conflicting interests among countries during the latter half of the meeting and toward the end, but in the final stages, an agreement was reached to transition away from fossil fuels that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. However, global measures are considered inadequate; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that even if the current emissions reduction targets of individual countries are implemented, temperatures will rise nearly 3 ℃ by the end of this century. Countries are beginning to create new emissions reduction targets based on the agreed document. The term \"transition away\" is abstract, and the seriousness of individual countries, backed by a sense of crisis, is tested to show how far they can mitigate the serious damage caused by climate change. Stocktake confirmed a 'target of 43% reduction by 2030 relative to 2019 levels' COP28 was attended by approximately 85,000 participants, including government representatives from roughly 200 countries, as well as members of environmental research institutes and environmental organizations who participated in various events during the session. The agreement, or stocktake, was adopted just before noon local time on December 13 (around 4:00 p.m. Japan time). According to government officials who participated in the conference, the most difficult part was the wording related to the expansion of reduction targets to encompass all fossil fuels. Oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, strongly objected to the initially proposed term, \"phase-out.\" In response to this reaction, island nations and European countries, which had demanded \"abandon\" at one time, also expressed opposition. In the end, an agreement was reached on the wording, \"transition away.\" The stocktake initially expressed serious concern that this year would be the hottest year on record. It acknowledged that the \"1.5 ℃ target\" of the Paris Agreement was unachievable under the current circumstances. It then explicitly stated that to achieve net zero global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a significant emissions reduction would be required (43% below the 2019 levels by 2030 and 60% below by 2035). The stocktake incorporated a target set by \"like-minded countries\" at the beginning of the conference \"to triple the global installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030.\" The document also promotes the acceleration of efforts toward the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems over the next decade in a just, orderly, and equitable manner. Additionally, it aims for doubling energy efficiency. Conversely, it adheres to the previous direction of \"accelerating efforts to phase out\" coal-fired power generation involving fossil fuels for which no emissions reduction measures have been taken and for which \"abandon\" was not achieved, though many countries had demanded it. It also includes the use of nuclear power and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage technologies, as requested by some countries. It states that inefficient fossil fuel subsidies will be phased out as soon as possible. With regard to the funding arrangements requested by developing countries, the document explicitly outlines the establishment of a \"fund for responding to loss and damage\" and includes language calling for further contributions from developed countries. A series of declarations and commitments made by like-minded countries during the conference At COP28, in parallel with negotiations by all contracting parties, there were noticeable occasions where a number of like-minded countries sharing individual targets announced their own declarations and commitments. This was a feature of the current conference, with many of these declarations and commitments announced to the public immediately after the opening of the conference and during the first half of the session. The UAE, which served as the organizer of the conference, aimed to spread the actions of like-minded countries to all contracting parties in order to create a positive atmosphere. First, the chair country took the lead in outlining a commitment by like-minded countries early in the conference to triple the global installed capacity for renewable energy by 2030. Ultimately, 130 countries, including the United States and Japan, participated in the conference, and this number is well over half of the total number of the COP parties. The commitment includes the tripling of installed renewable energy capacity to 11,000 gigawatts from the 2022 level, as well as improvements in energy efficiency, to achieve the 1.5 ℃ target. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida delivered a speech on December 1, the day the summit was held, and stated that he \"agreed to triple the amount of renewable energy.\" A coalition of like-minded countries, led by France and the United States, was also launched with the aim of accelerating the transition away from coal-fired power generation. The coalition included the European Union (EU), Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. Japan initially considered joining the coalition, but ultimately decided not to do so. In his speech, Kishida announced a policy to end the construction of new coal-fired power plants that have not established emissions reduction measures; however, he did not specify an end date. The most notable declaration among like-minded countries was the declaration to \"triple nuclear power.\" The declaration explicitly states that \"nuclear power can play a significant role in mitigating climate change.\" Core elements of the declaration include working together to advance the development of next-generation technologies, such as \"small modular reactors,\" to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050. In addition to the United States and Japan, Canada, France, Finland, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries expressed their intention to participate, but the total number of countries was limited to approximately 20. In response to this declaration, environmental organizations both in Japan and abroad have issued joint statements expressing criticism. A declaration aiming to strengthen food production, which is considered one of the pillars of climate change adaptation measures, was finalized and endorsed by 158 nations. The declaration emphasizes the importance of supporting developing countries, as food security are at stake therein. Another declaration was issued to strengthen measures to prevent the spread of climate-sensitive disease and reduce health risks; 143 nations participated. Japan was also included in these two declarations. UNEP warns of record high temperatures and emissions The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report on November 20, ahead of the opening of the COP28 summit, warning that global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2022. The report is entitled \"Emissions Gap Report 2023.\" Its subtitle is \"Broken Record.\" The subtitle implies that the report is repetitive, as if it were a broken record, but it could also be interpreted as ironic in that no progress has been made in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The report begins by noting this past summer's global heat wave and pointing out that \"the average temperature in September exceeded the previous record by 0.5 ℃, which was 1.8 ℃ above pre-industrial levels.\" It mentions that 86 days in 2023 were recorded with temperatures over 1.5 ℃ targeted by the Paris Agreement. The report indicates that summer 2023 was the hottest summer in history, with catastrophic extreme weather events. Furthermore, the report explicitly states that global emissions in 2022 were the highest on record, increasing by 1.2% from the previous year to reach a record high of 57.4 gigatons of CO2 equivalent. Based on the reduction targets set by individual countries, global emissions are projected to reach 52 billion metric tons by 2030 and 51 billion metric tons by 2035. At this rate, the 1.5 ℃ target of the Paris Agreement is unlikely to be met, with an estimated chance of \"only 14% even in the most optimistic scenario\" for achieving it. The current measures taken by individual countries suggest a potential temperature increase of 2.5−2.9 ℃ by the end of this century, possibly exceeding 3 ℃ depending on delays in future countermeasures. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen commented in the report that the impacts of profound climate change and the results of the temperature rise projections based on the reduction targets currently issued by individual countries are undesirable. She emphasized, \"We must instead lift the needle out of the same old groove of insufficient ambition and not enough action, and start setting other records: on cutting emissions, on green and just transitions and on climate finance.\" We must share the urgency of the transition to a carbon-free society COP28 was held amid a series of weather disasters leading to unprecedented abnormal weather conditions throughout the world, which were accompanied by intensifying global conflicts, such as the war between that unfolded with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as the battle between the Israeli military and Islamic organization Hamas in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Greenhouse gases spread across borders and into the atmosphere over the entire planet. Climate change mitigation measures will only be effective if the international community works together. However, recent difficult world situations have also affected COP meetings. According to conference participants, King Abdullah II of Jordan warned at the summit-level meeting that the negative effects of climate change would escalate due to the destruction caused by war. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who was scheduled to deliver a speech, did not take the stage. U.S. President Joe Biden did not attend the conference. The latter half of the conference was overshadowed by recent tense world situations, and as in previous COPs, strongly reflected the confrontations between developed and developing countries. However, the reality is that global climate change continues unabated, and a serious crisis is becoming increasingly apparent. Many of the participating countries, while bound by their own immediate interests, shared the recognition that they must not delay the transition to a carbon-free society. Accordingly, they managed to reach an agreement. Immediately after the adoption of the outcome document, COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber of the UAE said, \"Working together was at the heart of the conference. We have grown in the midst of the difficult days.\" Accounting for 80% of emissions, G20 countries bear significant responsibility The expression \"transition away from fossil fuels\" was a compromise resulting from difficult negotiations. While this agreement can be seen as a step toward a shift from current inadequate global efforts, what is crucial is how each country will reliably implement the agreed-upon target of \"tripling renewable energy\" beyond the limits of their own domestic circumstances, and the progress toward this target will be the key to the future. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released an analysis during the COP28 session, stating that even if all commitments to triple renewable energy were implemented, the 1.5 ℃ target would still be far from being achieved. The data point to the severity of the current climate change mitigation measures. During the COP28, significant disparities were confirmed between the level of emissions reductions necessary to mitigate climate change and the targets set by individual countries. This problem is also clearly stated in the outcome document. In the face of this harsh reality, countries participating in the Paris Agreement will now begin formulating their next targets to develop an emissions reduction roadmap to 2035. The recent share of renewable energy in Japan's power generation is approximately 20% (FY2020 actual). Under the current Basic Energy Plan, the Japanese government aims to increase this share to 36−38% by FY2030. The work over the next year will be the foundation of emissions reduction targets for the next round to be submitted to the United Nations, and the revision process for the basic plan will also begin. The agreed-upon outcomes at this conference must be reflected in the next basic plan. Emissions from the Group of 20 countries and regions (G20), including both developed and emerging countries, account for 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. At COP28, developing countries, particularly those considered vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events, expressed a sense of urgency akin to a cry for help. The governments and citizens of the G20 countries, which emit the majority of greenhouse gases, bear a great deal of responsibility. Many meteorological experts point out that at the current pace of emissions reductions in individual countries, climate change will inevitably lead to an intensification of weather extremes, such as heat waves and droughts, and an escalation of damage from extreme weather events, such as heavy rainstorms. Countermeasures are urgently needed. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, upon the conclusion of COP28, emphasized that much more must be done \"to deliver climate justice to those on the frontlines of the crisis.\" He said, \"The world cannot afford delays, indecision, or half measures.\" (UCHIJO Yoshitaka / Science Journalist, Kyodo News Visiting Editorial Writer) Original article was provided by the Science Portal and has been translated by Science Japan.",
