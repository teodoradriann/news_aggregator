    "title": "HUD Video shows Badass F-16 Pilot dodging 6 Iraqi SAMs (without chaff or flares!) over Baghdad during Operation Desert Storm",
    "text": "In this article:\nF-16 dodging 6 Iraqi SAMs\nTaken during the Package Q air strike into Baghdad on Jan. 19, 1991 the famous\nhead-up display (HUD) video in this post features Emmett Tullia dodging 6 Iraqi SAMs with his F-16, callsign Stroke 3.\nPackage Q was one of the largest daytime raids undertook during\nOperation Desert Storm and after 2 nights of pounding by coalition forces the Iraqi’s were throwing everything they had.\nThe clip starts out with his premission arming before takeoff as he narrates into the footage. The SAM action begins around the 3:00. The radar waring receiver tones can be heard often. In some cases, you can even see the missile smoke trails.\nNoteworthy the video of his dancing with SAMs remains a teaching tool in the US Air Force (USAF) today.\nPackage Q\nAccording to Air Force Magazine’s PDF document\n‘Package Q’, then-Major Tullia flew one of the F-16s assigned to attack an oil refinery in Baghdad near a bend in the Euphrates River. Intelligence indicated that the Iraqis had grouped substantial defenses in the area.\nStill, Tullia was surprised at the intensity of the ground fire as he approached the target. Anti-aircraft shells were creating a virtual carpet of smoke and shrapnel in the sky, mostly at altitudes from 10,000 to 12,000 feet.\n“I didn’t expect such a big effort on their part,” he recalled.\nThe first SAMs appeared just prior to roll-in. There were two of them,\nSA-2s.\n“I turned around, saw them coming up. They went beneath us and overshot,” Tullia explained.\nHe was getting some additional missile warnings but he dived in and delivered his bombs on the now-burning refinery. As he pulled off and headed south the electronic countermeasures warnings escalated. He was now the hunted, not the hunter.\nTullia looked back and saw two missile plumes. He wondered if they were directed at him, and it quickly became clear they were.\n“Then I go, ‘Oh, no, time to start maneuvering,’” Tullia said.\nHe jettisoned his wing tanks to lighten up his F-16 and make it more nimble. Tullia remembers thinking the effect of this move was pretty impressive—it really did make a difference.\nThese two missiles also overshot and detonated harmlessly above his aircraft. He turned back onto the egress heading. But then two more SAMs came at him, from his left and right rear quadrants.\nChaff and flares did not dispense\nTullia began dancing in earnest, waiting until the last second before a hard turn to cause the missile to overshoot and detonate far enough away to avoid shrapnel damage to his fighter.\nAt this point he was separated from the right of his flight and losing altitude due to his defensive maneuvers.\n“It was challenging because I didn’t have a lot of chance to gain airspeed,” he said.\nHe’d punched his wing tanks and did not have a lot of remaining fuel. Using the augmented thrust could have made it impossible for him to return to base.\n“I was gambling that maybe in military power I could still get enough speed to maneuver. I was lucky because it did work out,” he says.\nFinally he was out of the SAM envelope and heading for south of the border at high altitude. A fellow 614th TFS pilot lagged back to keep him company. In the end, Tullia was surprised he had enough fuel to make it back. He landed in Qatar, pulled right off, and shut it down.\n“I don’t know how much gas I had left. It couldn’t have been much,” he recalled.\nWalking around the F-16 afterward Tullia and his crew chief discovered that his chaff and flares had not dispensed. He had avoided those missiles without countermeasures, utilizing his flying prowess alone.\n“I was kind of surprised,” he said, drily.\nFor this exploit, Maj. “E.T.” Tullia was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nPhoto credit: U.S. Air Force",

    "text": "© Reuters. Jones Soda leans on innovation and customer input to drive success Proactive Investors - “Give the people what they want” is a tried-and-true business philosophy, but rarely does one come across a company as open to customer wants and ideas as Jones Soda Co (CSE:JSDA, OTCQB:JSDA). From putting photos submitted by consumers on the bottles of its craft sodas to encouraging product customization for events big and small, listening to its base has made Jones a success story for over a quarter of a century.\nCanadian Securities Exchange Magazine caught up with David Knight, the company’s new President and Chief Executive Officer, in early November to learn about the history of the brand and what comes next. Expanding a winning formula into multiple new markets lies at the core of its tasty plan.\nProactive: Jones has one of the most eye-catching and constantly evolving brands in any market. Consumers can even submit their own photos and potentially see them on a bottle. This is obviously a reflection of corporate culture and a philosophy of success. Tell us more about the thinking behind the brand.\nDK: The company was founded in 1995, so it’s been around for 28 years now. The founders chose the name Jones because they wanted one of the most frequently used last names in the country. They started with Smith and ended up going with Jones, which is in the top five in the US and the top 15 in Canada. It was really started as the beverage of the people.\nThe platform is all about natural cane sugar with unique flavours and bright colours. It’s about fun and great taste and lots of options.\nFrom a community standpoint, this month we have our one millionth community photo on the bottles, so we’ve got a deep level of interaction with our core consumers who, as you said, send in their photos, and if they make it, their photo goes on the bottles. It is a lot of fun, and we get real engagement and great stories on our products.\nLast year, we added augmented reality, which means you can use an app on your phone and bring a photo to life as a video.\nWe started on the street, so we are very deep into action sports like BMX and skate and surf. We were the cool brand to be found in skate shops and delis, and since then have moved into larger formats such as Safeway (NYSE:SWY), Albertsons, Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ). It’s really grown from the original days and has been a fun ride for the team.\nAs the newly appointed President and CEO, what is your plan for the company? What is the focus, what are you looking to preserve and is there anything you believe needs to change?\nAs we’ve just talked about, we’ve got a very powerful brand. We think there is a huge opportunity with consumers who have experienced Jones at various times throughout their lives. We have that core group of consumers, and we also need to invest in the next generation and bring those folks into Jones as well. We are doing that, in part, through more distribution and getting into convenience stores.\nAs a beverage guy, I’m a big believer in cold availability, which means making sure that Jones is available cold at arm’s length for consumers. Anywhere there is a fridge with beverages in it, Jones needs to be there. In other words, distribution growth.\nThe team has done a wonderful job of getting us into the cannabis market as well. We launched Mary Jones in California and have good penetration among dispensaries in the state. We quickly became the number one cannabis soda and were just voted the best-tasting cannabis soda at a recent cannabis cup.\nThe transition of great taste from soda into cannabis beverages has been a big one. We’re in Washington now too and are launching into Michigan. We’ll then be looking at expanding the brand into other states, with a strong look at Canada in 2024.\nBeyond that, we just launched Jones Plus, which is an energy play. It’s a high-boost caffeinated beverage.\nSo, the theme is innovation that makes sense for us in categories and beverages where the brand will work. We define that as craft sodas, craft caffeinated beverages and the cannabis play with Mary Jones in both the regulated and the Delta 9 hemp-derived space.\nLet’s look at results. Sales dropped a little over 10% from the first half of 2022 on a challenging year-on-year comparison, though margins improved quite noticeably. Is that improvement reflective of operations or are there external factors at play?\nManagement set a focus on margin improvement about three years ago with a five-year objective of getting to a 35% margin. So far, I think we’ve achieved an improvement of nine percentage points, so that’s a huge accomplishment by the operations team.\nAs we’re mostly in large format retail stores, grocery, etc., we did see some headwinds. Some of our accounts during COVID-19 switched from single bottles to four-packs and then switched back, and this is what caused most of our volume decline.\nThanks to innovation, including a mini can which I think will do well, we are expecting a rebound next year, as we have a new format, new space and new distribution in the retail market.\nThe beverage business is pretty cyclical. You present, you get listings, you drive volume for that year and you kind of rinse and repeat for the next year. We’ve just gone through that cycle and expect some big wins for 2024.\nLet’s look at the creative side of the company. Internally, where do ideas for flavours such as Zombie Juice and Pucker Punch come from?\nWe believe that good ideas can come from anywhere. And again, our community is pretty forthcoming with ideas. We get a lot of flavour ideas from customers, and underneath every cap we have a little phrase from the community. We take ideas beyond just the photos we get.\nJones also has a pretty tight creative team. Some of our team have been on the brand for over 20 years, so we have a good history and legacy of what Jones is and how we can keep that authentic.\nThat’s one of our secret sauces. It’s the creativity of the brand. We are edgy and we like to have fun, and as a team, we select the ones that we think are going to work. We try not to take ourselves too seriously, though we do drive hard at it.\nYou mentioned you get a lot of feedback from the community. Can you share a story with us that stands out in your mind?\nIn my first week at Jones, I was going through an airport with a Jones t-shirt on, and someone pulled me aside and said, “Oh, Jones is super cool. I love the turkey gravy.” We came out with a turkey gravy flavour for Thanksgiving several years ago, and it comes back every year.\nSimilarly, we are now launching a dog soda based on bone broth and some functional ingredients that help dogs with joint health. It goes to show that these fanciful flavours really do resonate, and we get community feedback, press pickup — I don’t know of another beverage business that does this.\nHumans drink throughout the day, but there is competition for their dollar . What are the top reasons you believe the company can increase its value consistently going forward?\nI’m a brand guy and have worked on some pretty big brands, but Jones is a particularly good one. It has a deep history and is known for its fun irreverence. We are a very welcoming brand across all genres, colours sizes and shapes. I feel blessed that I’m working on a brand that has such a legacy in this country. You talk to people who have had Jones, and they can tell you a story about their first experience with a cream soda or a root beer.\nWe have a team that is passionate about the business and a culture that thrives in terms of ideas and appetite for growth and going the extra mile. It’s a great brand with great people.\nThe one area I really want to drive is innovation and continuing to do things that bigger companies do not. We have a brand called MyJones where consumers send us a photo for an engagement party or a graduation, and they can customize the bottles for their event. We take customization seriously, all the way to our retailers. As an example, we’ll do special events for our retailers where we put their brand on bottles. Customization is a competitive advantage, and we’ll do a lot more of it in 2024.\nAnd we are pushing the edge of what else Jones can do beyond craft soda, caffeinated beverages and cannabis beverages. We are pushing the innovation pipeline for next year.\nPartners are important, too. I can talk about STK Steakhouse and Kona Grill. Jones is now on their menu for soda, a float and a spiked Jones. They are responding well to the velocity and margin that they are getting and the glass bottle that works with fine dining.\nWe’re really making sure we get Jones into more key distribution points and have people celebrate the legacy of the brand. We are doing a lot of great things for next year, and we’re all really excited.\nRead more on Proactive Investors CA\nDisclaimer\nJones Soda leans on innovation and customer input to drive success",

    "text": "A \"supercharged\" electron microscope worth almost $2 million is set to place James Cook University researchers at the forefront of the green energy revolution. Officially launched this week at JCU's Advanced Analytical Centre (AAC) in Townsville, the microscope will allow JCU to continue its work with mining industry partners to identify valuable mineral deposits and rare earth elements needed to power renewable energy technologies. The device features high-resolution imaging, sophisticated energy dispersive and wavelength X-ray spectrometers that can analyse the composition of any solid material. AAC Director Dr Kevin Blake said the new instrument represented a quantum leap in technology over the 20-year-old microscope it replaces. \"Everything about it supercharged from the previous instrument,\" he said. \"It means you've got very sensitive X-rays detection and much higher resolution imaging potentially down to a nanometre scale, which is millionths of a millimetre. \"We've effectively doubled the count rate of X-rays that we can do compared to the previous machine, which means we can work either twice as fast or get down to even lower levels of detection.\" Dr Blake said the cutting-edge microscope took six weeks to calibrate and set up, and would be maintained by his team at the AAC. JCU Economic Geology Research Unit Director Dr Ioan Sanislav said the instrument would save both time and money for mining industry partners involved in critical minerals exploration. \"Everything we could do before, we can do now at the next level,\" he said. \"This microscope offers a new capability in that we can map larger areas quicker in a sample and at higher resolution. \"We can identify the distribution of these elements much better inside a mineral or a rock. Another aspect is if we want to analyse the chemistry of these critical minerals, it's again much faster. \"It also opens up the possibility to see things that we couldn't see previously, giving metallurgical and chemical engineers the ability to design and prepare the most efficient mineral extraction processes.\" Dr Sanislav said post-graduate students would also benefit from the capabilities the microscope offered by developing their own research skills and exploring new areas of investigation. The arrival of the microscope follows JCU joining the Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Trailblazer program in 2022, a partnership with Curtin University and The University of Queensland, as well as 33 company and commercial partners across Australia involved in the technology metals, critical minerals and metals value chains. The microscope will be one of only two in Queensland, with the other being based at the University of Queensland (UQ). JCU Dean of Research Professor Andrew Krockenberger assisted in securing the microscope, which was made possible thanks to a successful joint $3.5m grant application with UQ to the Australian Research Council's Linkage, Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) scheme. \"We've had very good support from former UQ Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research Infrastructure Professor Joe Shapter,\" Prof Krockenberger said. \"What that allowed us to do was to put in an application where each university had a focus on a slightly different way of using their instrument. \"It enables JCU to push on and keep developing our expertise in geochemistry and minerology, which has an extremely strong reputation globally.\" Prof Krockenberger said the microscope could also assist with research in engineering, material sciences and medical-related fields. \"You can't support academic capability without the calibre of this type of instrument, and this new technology will support the next generation of researchers at JCU,\" he said. Prof Krockenberger commended the JCU team involved in acquiring the microscope. ''Dr Blake, JCU ARC Centre of Excellence for Indigenous and Environmental Histories Director Distinguished Professor Sean Ulm and Distinguished Professor Michael Bird and have all lent their expertise as Chief Investigators to the successful grant application proposal for the microscope, as did Adjunct Professor Paul Dirks as Lead Investigator,\" he said. \"They should all be immensely proud of this achievement,'' he said.

    "text": "После свадьбы вора в законе Лукашенко приказал разобраться с ним\nТюремная решетка. Фото: Reuters\nУбийство Щавлика\n10 декабря 1997 года примерно в 20 часов беларусскому вору в законе Щавлику (настоящее имя — Владимир Клещ) кто-то позвонил по мобильному телефону. В то время это еще было редкостью. Разговора никто не услышал, скорее всего, Щавлик просто молча выслушал собеседника. После этого он накинул куртку поверх домашней одежды и в домашних тапочках вышел на улицу. То ли жене, то ли соседке сказал, что отгонит стоящую во дворе машину. В квартиру он так и не вернулся.\nОколо полуночи супруга Щавлика Елена, не дождавшись мужа и увидев его машину распахнутой, обратилась к минчанину Анатолию, специализировавшемуся на вскрытии замков, чтобы тот закрыл автомобиль (ключа у женщины не было).\n«Я, когда приехал, увидел стоящую во дворе БМВ с раскрытой водительской дверью, ключей в замке зажигания не было, а в салоне на сиденье заметил несколько капель, похожих на кровь. Поразило же меня то, что от подъезда к машине по снегу вела цепочка следов, которая обрывалась возле автомобиля. То есть Владимир подошел к машине, открыл, сел, а потом некая сила его выдернула из-за руля. Других следов на снегу я не видел», — рассказывал позднее Анатолий журналистам.\nСправа — Владимир Клещ (Щавлик) с женой Еленой Вайдой. Рядом с ними певец Владислав Медяник с неизвестной женщиной. Фото: primecrime.ru\nА теперь перенесемся на три года назад, когда, собственно, и началась эта история. В июне 1994-го новоиспеченный вор в законе Щавлик (он получил этот статус пятью месяцами раньше в России) решил жениться второй раз, причем с шиком. Венчание с Еленой Вайдой прошло в Свято-Духовом кафедральном соборе, что у станции метро «Немига». Затем состоялся банкет в ресторане «Рандеву» (возможно, речь о заведении, работавшем на улице Тимирязева), среди гостей было немало криминальных авторитетов. Такой размах возмутил беларусские власти.\n«После того как Щавлик широко, открыто отпраздновал свою свадьбу или день рождения (там были [Михаил] Шуфутинский и другие эстрадные звезды), президент Лукашенко действительно вызвал министра внутренних дел и указал на то, что с этими людьми пора кончать», — рассказывал адвокат Гарри Погоняйло.\nАлександр Лукашенко тогда только-только заступил на свой пост, его инаугурация состоялась позже, в июле. Тогда его угрозы криминалу остались лишь словами: новоизбранный президент в первые два года был очень занят концентрацией власти в своих руках и установлением автократии, ему было не до борьбы с преступным миром.\nТак что карьера Щавлика — многократно сидевшего вора-домушника, получившего первую судимость в 15 лет — только шла вверх. В 1995-м умер Петр Науменко (Наум), первый человек в независимой Беларуси, получивший титулы «вор в законе» и «смотрящий» (так называют авторитета, уполномоченного решать все вопросы воровского мира на какой-то территории — в данном случае в стране). Наум был своего рода «крестным отцом» Щавлика, и после смерти покровителя тот стал его преемником в роли «смотрящего».\nПетр Науменко (вверху) и Владимир Клещ (Щавлик). После смерти первого «смотрящим» по Беларуси станет второй. Фото: mzk2.ru\nВ ноябре 1996 года в Беларуси фактически произошел государственный переворот: на сфальсифицированном референдуме была принята новая редакция Конституции, давшая Лукашенко абсолютную власть, был распущен независимый парламент и создан подконтрольный. Теперь можно было действовать без оглядки на оппозицию и законы.\nКак раз после референдума тогдашний секретарь Совета безопасности Виктор Шейман, один из ближайших соратников Лукашенко, поручил командующему внутренними войсками Юрию Сивакову «создать команду, которая смогла бы выполнять любые поручения, вплоть до убийства». Эту информацию впервые озвучил бывший следователь прокуратуры Олег Случек в июне 2001 года. Сиваков дал задание подобрать таких людей своему подчиненному, офицеру Дмитрию Павличенко.\n«Этой группе было приказано отработать схему похищения, убийства, а затем захоронения трупов. Схема должна была исключать возможность обнаружения трупов. Фактически это было задание разработать схему „идеального убийства“, потому что если нет трупа, то нет преступления, — рассказал Случек. — Для исключения опознания в случае обнаружения трупов решили использовать пистолет. Это был пистолет, который невозможно было впоследствии опознать — пистолет, которым в Республике Беларусь приводятся в исполнение смертные приговоры. Способ убийства выбрали — стрелять в голову. Этот пистолет давался Павличенко на один-два дня, а после выполнения заказа возвращался на место».\nКогда схема была разработана и одобрена сверху, ее решили опробовать на уголовных авторитетах.\nДмитрий Павличенко, руководивший «эскадроном смерти». 1990-е годы. Публикация: novayagazeta.ru\nСпусковым крючком для их устранения послужило убийство депутата парламента и председателя Комитета госконтроля Могилевской области Евгения Миколуцкого: в октябре 1997-го в подъезде дома, где он жил, сработала бомба. Взрывом ему оторвало руку, разорвало внутренние органы — чиновник умер на месте. Лукашенко воспользовался этим в своих целях. Он косвенно обвинил в причастности к убийству министра сельского хозяйства Василия Леонова и руководителя агрофирмы «Рассвет» Василия Старовойтова: они якобы убрали Миколуцкого, выявившего коррупцию с их стороны (позднее их причастность не подтвердилась, но оба отправились за решетку по другим поводам — и в этом видели политическую подоплеку). Также Лукашенко решил ударить по криминалу — одним выстрелом убить двух зайцев.\n«Они долго подбирались к президенту — не получилось. Решили начать с людей, которые были рядом с ним, которые всегда выполняли его волю. Я понимаю, что это вызов… Я предупреждаю всех тех, кто совершил это гнусное преступление, что если через неделю властям не будут переданы те, кто заказал его, мы предпримем адекватные меры, которые будут еще жестче, чем это гнусное преступление. Я хочу обратиться, используя средства массовой информации, и к уголовникам: запомните, господа, земля будет гореть у вас под ногами», — пообещал Лукашенко на траурном митинге.\n13 октября он заявил, что в убийстве Миколуцкого были задействованы «как криминальные структуры, так и структуры власти». И через две недели издал декрет «О неотложных мерах по борьбе с терроризмом и другими особо опасными насильственными преступлениями». По нему правоохранительные органы получили право задерживать «подозрительных личностей» на срок до одного месяца без предъявления обвинения.\nТаким образом, преступный мир назначили главным виновником гибели Миколуцкого (хотя за его смерть позже посадили других людей, не имевших отношения к ворам в законе). Менее чем через два месяца «смотрящий» по Беларуси Щавлик отправился на тот свет.\nДругие устранения и признание Лукашенко\nНа этом устранение уголовных авторитетов не закончилось. В апреле 1999-го в поселке Большевик под Минском исчез вор в законе Траца (настоящее имя Александр Трацевский). Сценарий пропажи был схож со случаем Щавлика: машина стояла нараспашку, в салоне нашли пару капель крови — все тот же почерк вероятного убийства.\nКроме того, как раз в то время погибли еще несколько авторитетов. В августе 2000 года в Витебске возле ночного клуба был убит вор в законе Геннадий Лукашов (Лукаш).\nГеннадий Лукашов (Лукаш). Фото: primecrime.ru\n«Каждый из этих „законников“ имел вес в беларусском криминальном мире, их статус был утвержден и признан вышестоящим российским воровским „генералитетом“, контролировавшим к началу 90-х практически все постсоветское пространство. Щавлик, Траца и Лукаш — это лидеры, физическое устранение которых серьезно отразилось на планах криминалитета по консолидации разрозненных и порой мешающих друг другу организованных преступных группировок (ОПГ) в единую структуру», — констатировал журналист Виктор Федорович, долгое время занимавшийся темой криминала.\nВскоре, в 2001-м, писал он, в Мозыре от рук киллеров погибли лидеры местной ОПГ Николай Гаев и Сергей Дубров. Первого убили в упор из пулемета-пистолета, второго расстрелял снайпер из винтовки с оптическим прицелом.\n«По традиции беларусские правоохранители все загадочные исчезновения и смерти авторитетов списывали на криминальные разборки за передел сфер влияния. Однако и по сей день в кругах по ту сторону закона считают, что к ликвидации многих их товарищей приложили руку именно спецслужбы», — добавлял Федорович.\nСколько всего было убито уголовников? В 2001 году Олег Случек рассказал, что государственный «эскадрон смерти» совершил более 30 убийств. Из этого списка надо вычесть политических (Юрия Захаренко, Виктора Гончара, Анатолия Красовского, Дмитрия Завадского), а также авторитета Мамонтенка (настоящее имя Сергей Коваленко), которого упомянул экс-следователь Генпрокуратуры. Оказалось, что с Мамонтенком вышла путаница: на тот момент он считался пропавшим и, скорее всего, убитым, как и прочие криминальники, но, как выяснилось позже, просто «сидел на игле» и залег на дно. Позже, в 2011-м, он, предположительно, покончил с собой. Таким образом, речь идет о более чем 25 убийствах «эскадрона смерти».\nПочему вся эта история об устранениях авторитетов не была выдумкой?\nВо-первых, Случек тогда же рассказал об оппозиционных политиках, похищенных «эскадронами смерти», что потом подтвердилось.\nВо-вторых, он был не единственным, кто раскрыл эту информацию — о том же говорил другой сотрудник следственной группы Генпрокуратуры Дмитрий Петрушкевич. Оба, выявив причастность властей к преступлениям, выехали из Беларуси, опасаясь за свою жизнь, и рассказали обо всем публично — так и стало известно об «эскадронах смерти».\nДмитрий Петрушкевич и Олег Случек в момент знаменитого интервью «Народной Воле» в 2001 году. Фото: БелаПАН\nВ-третьих, о судьбе «авторитетов» несколько раз высказывался и сам Лукашенко.\nВ октябре того же, 2001 года этот политик приехал с визитом в Гомель. Там он заявил, что еще пять лет назад (то есть как раз тогда, когда был создан «эскадрон смерти», в 1996-м) «через определенных жуликов» предупредил воров в законе: «Не дай бог где-то вы создадите обстановку криминальную, я вам поотрываю всем головы». Лукашенко признался, что у него в сейфе лежит подготовленный МВД список всех беларусских уголовных авторитетов: «Мы знаем всех, и не дай бог им шевельнуться!» Политик утверждал, что авторитеты жутко боятся, мол, он в случае чего их «замочит». «Был случай, когда они неправильно себя повели. Помните вы этих щавликов и прочих. Где они сейчас? Поэтому в стране порядок, и все довольны», — добавил Лукашенко. После этого пресс-секретарю политика Николаю Борисевичу пришлось заявлять, что президент к убийствам Щавлика и прочих «отношения не имел и не имеет».\nНо в 2011 году Лукашенко, выступая с посланием беларусскому народу и парламенту, прямо заявил:\n«Я вам честно рассказал, что еще 10 лет тому назад, что группировки, которые в свое время из советских штанишек выросли, связи у них были очень тесные с Москвой, мы их очень быстро прибрали к порядку. Тот, кто не подчинился, их уже и кости сгнили. У нас не может быть на криминальной основе этих разборок».\nВладимир Клещ (Щавлик). Фото: mzk2.ru\nНаконец, в августе 2020 года, напоминая беларусам перед выборами о своих «заслугах» за десятилетия правления, Лукашенко снова вспомнил, как ликвидировал бандитов. Он заявил, что в девяностые в стране действовали «банды, которые орудовали от Москвы до границы с Польской Республикой, обирая всех. Чуть дороже автомобиль — останавливали, выкидывали; сопротивлялся — расстреливали и сбрасывали под откос». По словам Лукашенко, таких банд было 32, и он лично потребовал у силовиков предоставить список бандитов и «зачистить их, как [маршал] Жуков в Одессе». Политик намекал на легенду, ставшую основой знаменитого сериала «Ликвидация»: якобы после Второй мировой войны одесские силовики, переодевшись в штатское, в одну ночь расстреляли бандитов без суда и следствия (это миф, никаких документов или воспоминаний об операции «Маскарад» не обнаружено). Лукашенко добавил, что Минск от банд «очистили за полгода».\n«Шейман и еще несколько человек, которые с пистолетом ездили, уничтожая подонков», — прямо сказал тогда политик. Все совпадает: ведь именно Шейман организовал группу для ликвидации криминальных авторитетов и оппозиционеров, а убийства совершались расстрельным пистолетом (именно в единственном числе). Таким образом Лукашенко еще раз подтвердил существование «эскадронов смерти» и внесудебные убийства людей.\nБесконечная «ликвидация преступности»\nПосле того как информация о существовании «эскадронов смерти» была опубличена, их деятельность прекратилась.\nИспользовав этот инструмент против уголовных авторитетов, власти решили одновременно несколько задач. Во-первых, потренировались в незаконном похищении и убийстве людей, а во-вторых, проверили реакцию общества. Оно никак не реагировало, поскольку долго не знало об этих убийствах. В итоге эта методика устранения неугодных людей была применена к политическим противникам Лукашенко.\nНо получилось ли решить задачу по снижению уровня преступности? Лукашенко в своих упомянутых выше высказываниях не раз апеллировал именно к этому: дескать, цель оправдывает средства, сильная авторитарная власть нужна, потому что способна навести порядок в стране.\nДействительно, ситуация в этой сфере в девяностые была сложной. К 1994 году в Беларуси насчитывалось 150 организованных преступных групп, два года спустя — уже около 300, их численность составляла до 3 тысяч человек. Росло и число преступлений. Решив изменить ситуацию, власти вместе с устранением ключевых криминальных фигур стали к остальным применять запугивание: «авторитетов» похищали, удерживали в неизвестном месте неделю-другую, возможно, избивали и угрожали, а затем отпускали их — и после этого уголовники вели себя тихо. В 2001-м за решетку был отправлен последний на тот момент беларусский вор в законе, после чего было объявлено, что с организованной преступностью в стране покончено.\nОднако в следующие пару лет на свободу вышел вор в законе Дмитрий Галеев (известен как Митя Галей), в нашу страну стал приезжать имевший аналогичный статус россиянин Владимир Бирюков (Биря). В 2004-м снова стали «принимать меры», милиция накрывала воровские «сходки», арестовали «смотрящего» по Минску Александра Забродина… В результате в 2006-м тогдашний глава МВД Беларуси Владимир Наумов, также связанный с «эскадронами смерти», вновь заявил, что в стране не осталось организованных преступных групп. Но и на этом не получилось поставить точку.\nВоры в законе (слева направо): Олег Рогачев (Рогаченок), Владимир Бирюков (Биря), Владимир Клещ (Щавлик) и Вячеслав Крылов (Славка Крыл). Фото: mzk2.ru\n«Всего несколько лет назад наши оперативные сотрудники МВД утверждали, что вопрос с оргпреступностью не стоит в повестке дня, а воров в законе вообще нет. А тут за полтора года „законников“ стало больше, чем за все 90-е», — писала в 2014-м газета «СБ. Беларусь сегодня».\nКак видно, это цикличный процесс: зачистки приводят к уменьшению активности уголовников, но вскоре освободившиеся ниши заполняют другие люди. Это, пожалуй, естественный процесс для любой страны мира: вряд ли где-то удалось победить криминалитет, он всегда находит новые пути.\n«Нынешняя оргпреступность вышла на новый уровень — это уже не „быки“ с дубинами, а вполне респектабельные люди, всеми способами стремящиеся занять приличное место в обществе. Да, когда-то они пополняли „общак“ за счет украденного у пенсионера кошелька и ограбленных „челноков“, теперь они стремятся прибирать к рукам наиболее высокодоходные сферы бизнеса, надев на себя маски коммерсантов. Поэтому одной из приоритетных наших задач является раскрытие и предупреждение таких преступлений как легализация (отмывание) денег, добытых преступным путем. Криминальные состояния не должны быть спрятаны за вывеской солидного бизнеса», — говорил в 2007-м Владимир Тихиня, первый замглавы ГУБОПиК (тогда это управление МВД оправдывало свое название и занималось борьбой с организованной преступностью, а не с оппонентами власти). По иронии судьбы, позже выяснилось, что сам Тихиня за взятки покрывал коррупционную схему на предприятиях по производству сахара.\nВладимир Тихиня, Минск, 2017 год. Фото: sputnik.by\nНо переход от «быков» с дубинами к «респектабельным людям» был естественным и типичным для всего постсоветского пространства. Британский исследователь Марк Галеотти писал в своей книге «Воры. История организованной преступности в России», что девяностые были «золотым веком» российских бандитов, а к концу десятилетия войны между ними почти завершились.\n«Границы территорий были в целом согласованы. Сформировались иерархии, а любые дальнейшие конфликты не привели бы ни к чему хорошему с точки зрения бизнеса. В результате организованная преступность стала более регулируемой», — отмечал британец.\nБеларусский преступный мир был и сегодня остается частью российского. И отечественные воры в законе — начиная с упомянутого выше Наума и заканчивая Сашей Кушнером, которого лишь в 2023-м приговорили к 24 годам колонии, — строили свою «карьеру» в общем с россиянами пространстве. Процессы в криминальном мире Беларуси были едиными с соседним государством — и, как и там, организованная преступность в Беларуси со временем «остепенилась», не ушла, но приобрела иные, менее заметные формы. Это ни в коем случае не умаляет работу простых оперативников, все эти годы боровшихся с бандами. Но показывает, что Александр Лукашенко имел весьма косвенное отношение к решению этой проблемы.\nОднако важнее всего, что, наказывая воров в законе, власти цинично нарушили все правовые нормы. Ведь то, что речь шла о несомненных преступниках, не отменяет того, что их судьбу должен был решать законный суд. Случившееся с криминальными авторитетами было важным показателем разрушения правоохранительной системы в стране уже тогда, более двадцати лет назад. С тех пор она полностью поставлена на службу властям, а на справедливый суд в Беларуси не могут рассчитывать ни уголовники, ни добропорядочные граждане — результаты этого мы особенно ярко видим в последние пять лет.\nТеракты в Беларуси.

    "title": "What to Expect on a Cruise: The Weather",
    "text": "Devastating fires in Maui, Rhodes and Tenerife; hurricanes and earthquakes in California; hazy skies from Canadian wildfires across the Northeastern US. The summer of 2023 saw its fair share of natural disasters that disrupted daily life in numerous places around the globe. And cruises are not exempt. From hurricanes to wildfires, catastrophic weather and natural disasters are understandably able to alter and even cancel cruise itineraries. Cruise lines know this and try to place their ships in destinations where the weather is less likely to affect the itinerary, but avoiding inclement weather is never guaranteed. If inclement weather prevents you from getting to your cruise or affects a destination in the middle of your itinerary, knowing what to expect can help you have a better handle of the situation. Having your travel plans affected by natural disasters and severe weather is disappointing, but not nearly as devastating as what the locals are going through. It's important to keep this in perspective and understand that the priority should always be to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of everyone on the ship -- and everyone on land, too. Instead of investing time and energy into getting upset about your travel plans, spare a thought to those affected. Or better yet, find out how you can help. Even when you embark your cruise and are safely onboard, you may not know if a port of call will be affected. In some cases, such as with hurricanes, you'll probably know at least a day ahead of time. Other times, a captain may actually attempt to dock, but be unable to and thus elect to skip the port call. This can be due to weather conditions like fog or anticipated storms (we've had both cancel port calls in years past), or due to other non-environmental factors like labor or civil unrest. If the captain of your cruise decides it's too dangerous to proceed with the scheduled itinerary, he or she might implement any number of alternative plans. You might get one or more extra days at sea, or the captain could swap out the missed port for a new port, should one be available. Sometimes, the entire order of ports is rearranged so that all are still visited but at times when the weather will be less disruptive. [Norwegian Cruise Line](/find-a-cruise/cruise-line-norwegian-ncl) did this in Hawaii [, rerouting Pride of America from Maui](/news/norwegian-replaces-calls-to-maui-pledges-donation-to-united-way/) around the time when the wildfires struck. The ship instead overnighted in [Hilo](/find-a-cruise/port-hilo) and [Kauai](/find-a-cruise/port-kauai), while the itinerary was modified for the near-future to allow time for the island to recover. While not common -- but not unheard of -- cruise ships may sometimes be forced to switch entire destinations. For example, your [Eastern Caribbean cruise itinerary](/find-a-cruise/destination-eastern-caribbean) could be changed to a [Western Caribbean itinerary](/find-a-cruise/destination-western-caribbean) one, or your entire [Caribbean cruise](/find-a-cruise/destination-caribbean) could be replaced by a [Bermuda](/find-a-cruise/destination-bermuda) or [New England and Canada](/find-a-cruise/destination-canada) sailing in the event a hurricane makes the original itinerary impossible. Because cruise ships can move around bad weather, full [cancellations](/articles/cruise-line-cancellation-policies-a-closer-look) are rare. But they can and do happen. Cruise lines are loath to cancel sailings and try to wait as long as possible before making a decision, while still trying to give passengers enough lead time to make alternate plans if necessary. If a cruise line does cancel, it will offer compensation -- usually a full refund of the cruise fare and possibly an additional percentage of your fare paid, given in the form of a [future cruise credit](/articles/what-is-future-cruise-credit-and-how-can-i-use-it). You're always free to cancel your cruise before the cruise line does, but in most cases, you will lose the full price you paid for the cruise (minus port fees). In instance of extremely severe storms (like hurricanes), cruise lines will typically allow passengers to cancel without penalty. Cruise Critic always recommends [buying travel insurance](/articles/travel-insurance-primer-for-cruise-travelers) that covers weather disruptions. This might not allow you to cancel because of impending storms, but it will cover you for travel disruptions caused by a storm or other significant weather events and natural disasters. When it comes to storms, one of the advantages of cruising is that ships can move away from the affected weather. Cruise ships have a slew of sophisticated technology onboard to monitor the weather. On top of that, cruise lines augment their onboard information with forecasts from weather assessment companies. If a storm is threatening the area a ship was scheduled to sail to, cruise lines will reroute the ships if the forecast is severe enough. While cruise ships can typically \"outrun\" most storms, passengers may still experience rough seas as their ship skirts the edges of a weather system. When a port is skipped, the only compensation you are entitled to is that destination's port fees. This is usually a minimal amount (think $10 to $20) and will be given to you in the form of a shipboard credit that will be applied toward your onboard spending. Occasionally, a cruise line will offer a little extra spending money (in the form of an onboard credit), especially if multiple ports are missed or the entire itinerary has to be changed. Either way, it's important to remember: the cruise line is required to keep you safe, not meet the published itinerary. While there are some regions, like the [Antarctic](/find-a-cruise/destination-antarctica), that are susceptible to weather disruptions year-round, most areas of the world contend with bad weather on a seasonal basis. For instance, Caribbean cruises are most likely to be disrupted during hurricane season, which runs from June to November. Asia can experience cyclones any time, but the most active period is from July to November. The Alaskan low seasons are April to May (small-ship line [Alaska Dream Cruises](/find-a-cruise/cruise-line-alaskan-dream) offers [Alaska itineraries](/find-a-cruise/destination-alaska) as early as March) and September because there is a greater chance of rain, cold weather and even snow. For a complete roundup of the best times of year to cruise to any particular region, check out [Best Time to Cruise](https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles/best-time-to-go-on-a-cruise). Sometimes, however, severe weather can be unpredictable. Southern California is not known as a target for hurricanes, yet Hurricane Hilary made landfall in the Golden State in August 2023. On top of that, the region suffered a 5.1 earthquake. While these occurrences are indeed rare, they can still happen and are practically impossible to predict. For the most part, however, if you keep your eye on weather forecasts or any local news, you should be able to predict potential issues with your cruise vacation. If there is a significant weather threat, the cruise line will also keep you up to date, but it never hurts to stay one step ahead. And finally, investing in travel insurance can always provide that extra peace of mind, especially if you're sailing during hurricane season or any other potentially problematic season.",

    "text": "MADRID, 26 Sep. (EUROPA PRESS) - El Ejército israelí ha llevado a cabo este jueves una nueva oleada de bombardeos contra objetivos del partido-milicia chií libanés Hezbolá en el sur de Líbano en el marco de la campaña intensificada de ataques aéreos contra el país desde el lunes. Los ataques han afectado a las localidades de Salaa, Abbasiyé, Tura y Selá, en el distrito de Tiro, ubicado en la gobernación de Líbano Sur. Asimismo, se han registrado otros cuatro bombardeos en Ghaziye, al sur de Beirut, según ha recogido 'L'Orient Le-Jour'. Por su parte, Hezbolá ha anunciado en un comunicado que ha atacado la ciudad israelí de Kiriat Ata, situada a pocos kilómetros al este de Haifa, con cerca de 50 misiles, según ha recogido la cadena de televisión libanesa Al Manar, vinculada a la milicia. Estados Unidos y Francia hicieron un llamamiento el miércoles a una tregua \\\"temporal\\\" de 21 días entre Israel y Hezbolá, si bien el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, ha recalcado este mismo jueves que ha dado orden al Ejército para que continúe \\\"con todas sus fuerzas\\\" las operaciones contra el país vecino.",
