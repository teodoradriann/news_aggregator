    "title": "Kepung Demi Palestin five-day picket unites Malaysians, Palestinians from all walks of life | Malay Mail",
    "text": "> KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 31 — Kepung Demi Palestin’s five-day picket enters its fifth day and a supporter of the cause, Cikgu Chin made it just in time for the finale tonight.\nShe had hopped on a midnight bus from Kedah to make her way to Jalan Tun Razak — in the vicinity of the US Embassy — where the picket is stationed.\n“I just wanted to support the organisers in any way I could, and that is to be here in person. I know that we can’t do much as ordinary Malaysians, but being here, I hope to show more people that what is happening in Gaza is not right,” the retired teacher who only wanted to be known as Cikgu Chin told Malay Mail when met here.\nThe 60-year-old said in a way she could relate to what was happening in Gaza, Palestine with regards to land ownership, as she too was facing a similar problem from where she hailed — Kedah.\nAdvertisement “My problem is nowhere as severe compared to the Palestinians, but I feel deeply for them, it feels somewhat similar as I’m facing difficulties in claiming what belongs to my family,” she said.\nCikgu Chin speaks to Malay Mail about her support for the cause. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\nAs the five-day picket entered its fifth day, last night saw both Malaysians and Palestinians share their direct and indirect encounter with the conflict between Palestine and Israel.\nAdvertisement An eight-year-old Palestinian boy was among those who shared how he had lost all of his relatives in Palestine in this war.\n“I would like to tell a story today, about my mum and me [back then]. I heard bombings from outside, and I asked my mum, what is this?\n“She told me she didn’t know, and when we went out to see what was happening, we saw all of the people outside had fallen to the ground.\n“My mum had then said, let’s go and help them. I asked her, how can we help them? She said with food and water. But when we got back to our house, we saw that it had already been hit by a bomb, and my brother was on the ground, my mum started crying,” the eight-year-old boy who is only known as Khaled, who now lives with his family here in Kuala Lumpur, said.\nA Palestinian university student only known as Heba, also related how her relative’s safety was at high risk all the time in Palestine, as long as the war still went on.\nPalestinian university student Heba talks about her relative's safety in Palestine. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n“Each time when I am in contact with my cousin, I don’t know what to ask her. I could ask her ‘how are you’ and she would say that she is okay but she is not fine.\n“The situation is really bad there right now. Imagine doctors who need to conduct amputation without anaesthesia. That is just one of the scenarios that is ongoing right now,” Heba said.\nShe had also conveyed her wish that those who were listening to her would continue to share what is happening in Gaza, and Palestine and that it should not become a normalised situation.\n“My request to every one of you here tonight, is to please keep on sharing about what is happening because the world is starting to normalise what is happening. We never normalise,” she said.\nObstetrician and gynaecologist consultant Dr Fauziah Mohd Hassan was among those present at the gathering last night she came in her scrubs — protective garment designed worn by doctors, nurses and others in the operating room.\nObstetrician and gynaecologist consultant Dr Fauziah Mohd Hassan. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n“I have spoken before this, but tonight I’m here in my operation suit. I want to show my solidarity with the doctors and nurses who have been killed by the Zionists and how they have destroyed the healthcare system in Gaza, and have used this destruction of the healthcare system as a weapon of war.\n“I was told... that there are 60,000 wounded Palestinians but only 1,000 have been able to be brought out for treatment to Tunisia, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. We hope that Malaysia too can take some of the wounded so that we can treat them here,” Dr Fauziah said.\nShe said there are currently 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza with 180 deliveries per day.\n“Can you just imagine delivering in tents? There is no water, no electricity, no cooked food or rather no food even,” she said.\nSekretariat Solidarity Palestin spokesman Chua Tian Chang said the picket has been able to convey the scenario in Gaza right now and has managed to generate intense attention among the public and the media.\n“The five-day picket isn’t like the demonstrations in the past where there are intervals in between — one demonstration this Friday and another next Friday — but in between another 2,000 deaths.\n“And we also picked the final days [of the year], we all know in Bethlehem they cancelled Christmas [celebrations], and many countries in Europe also cancelled their celebrations in solidarity with Gaza. So we started on the 26th until the New Year, symbolically we also hope that next year will bring a better future for Palestine.\n“It has shown the solidarity among Malaysians. This is one issue that united the people, every political party expressed the same sentiment,” Chua said adding that the cause wishes to also break the monolithic idea that Palestine is a Muslim issue only.\n“So we managed to bring together multiracial participation,” he added.\nPejuang president Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir said the party has been supporting the cause of solidarity with Palestine no matter who organised it.\n“We just have to be here, it’s such an important issue,” he said when met.",

    "text": "Inter Miami, con pocos minutos de Lionel Messi, recibió hoy una dura goleada por parte de Al Nassr de Arabia Saudita por 6 a 0 en Riad, que no contó con el portugués Cristiano Ronaldo por una lesión, en un amistoso.\nLos goles fueron de Otávio (3m. PT), Anderson Talisca (10m. PT, 6m. ST, de penal, 28m. ST), Aymeric Laporte (12m. PT), con un remate desde atrás del mediocampo y Mohammed Maran (23m. ST).\nEn un primer momento, Inter Miami difundió el once inicial y los relevos para el partido que comenzó a las 15 de Argentina, en la capital saudí de Riad, y Lionel Messi no figuró ni en el banco de suplentes. Sin embargo, minutos después cambiaron la publicación tras observar al rosarino en la entrada en calor.\nEl ingreso de Messi se dio a los 38 minutos del segundo tiempo, con el partido ya resuelto, en lugar de Leonardo Campana.\nLa ausencia en el once titular del rosarino trató de ser disimulada con las apariciones del uruguayo Luis Suárez y los españoles Sergio Busquets y Jordi Alba, todos excompañeros en el histórico Barcelona que ganó el triplete en 2015, pero un pésimo inicio condenó la suerte de Inter Miami.\nAdemás, Cristiano Ronaldo está en su etapa final de recuperación y también fue baja en la vereda de enfrente, según confirmó Luis Castro, su entrenador.\nEn consecuencia, los fanáticos se quedaron sin el duelo de las estrellas y debieron conformarse con un puñado de minutos de Messi, al que ovacionaron.",

    "title": "Quebec's ombudsman opens investigation into long wait times for death certificates | CBC News",
    "text": "[Montreal](/news/canada/montreal) Letter sent to families who filed complaints, some of whom have been waiting months Quebec's ombudsman is investigating delays in issuing death certificates in the province following a high number of complaints, the office confirmed Thursday. In a story published last week, CBC News found delays continued to get worse months after the government promised to improve wait times. Last spring, it took on average more than 40 working days to register a death in Quebec. That's for applications that were not missing any information. Once the death is registered, a certificate is typically issued within a week. The delay increased to 52 working days by the end of May, and then as of Aug. 4, the average time jumped to 55.85 working days, according to the most recent statistics available from the Employment Ministry. The ministry oversees the civil status registrar, the agency responsible for registering births, marriages and deaths. 'There's no explanation' CBC News has spoken with families who have been stuck waiting for the certificate for up to seven months. mong them was Lynda Baker-Thorslund, whose father died in December. She finally received his death certificate on Wednesday. \"It really slows things down at a time when you're trying to wrap things up, and it's emotional,\" she told CBC News on Thursday. \"Seven months seems like a very long time to get a certificate.\" Her father, who lived in Montreal his entire life, was married to Baker-Thorslund's mother for 63 years. As she helped arrange her father's finances for her mother, some banks accepted the funeral home's death certificate, but others wouldn't. \"If I was the executor for the estate, maybe you have a property to sell or something, it's quite the delay and there's no explanation as to why,\" she said. \"I just wonder how much research they have to do in order to issue a death certificate.\" In a letter sent to families, obtained by Radio-Canada, the ombudsman's office said it hopes to intervene to help find solutions to the issue. In a phone interview, Joseph Simoneau, director of communications for the office, said the investigation will include an analysis of all the complaints. He said recommendations to solve the issue will be conveyed directly to the departments responsible, but he could not say whether a report would be made public. Simoneau could not confirm how many complaints are being investigated but said others who have been affected by the delays are welcome to file one. He said all families who contacted the ombudsman's office will be notified by letter when the situation is resolved. Action being taken, ministry says Catherine Poulin, spokesperson for the Employment Ministry, said in an email that processing a death file is much more complex than other life event files, such as births, marriages and civil unions. \"All information relating to past life events of a deceased person, whether they took place in Quebec or outside Quebec, must be corroborated with the information declared,\" said Poulin, adding the verification process must be exhaustive to ensure accuracy. \"This being said, the ministry is aware of the repercussions of these delays for families and is doing everything possible to restore the situation. Concrete actions are being put in place to reduce delays.\" She said employees were hired and trained and they are now on the job, though she didn't specify how many. She said the ministry is confident that new resources, combined with systemic improvements and the automation of certain processes, will help to reduce delays in the coming months.

    "title": "Zelelensky: cada acordo de apoio e ajuda entregue à Ucrânia “diminui o apetite de Putin pela agressão” – Observador",
    "text": "Siga aqui o liveblog sobre a guerra na Ucrânia\n“O futuro da Ucrânia está na NATO”. Em conferência de imprensa com o Presidente ucraniano, Jens Stoltenberg voltou a afirmar o compromisso “irreversível” para a adesão. Da parte da Ucrânia, Zelensky garante que estão “muito perto do objetivo”.\nDepois de um breve encontro com Joe Biden, e antes de começar o Conselho NATO-Ucrânia, o Presidente da Ucrânia e o secretário-geral da NATO falaram aos jornalistas, onde reafirmaram as promessas que ficaram expressas na declaração final da 75ª Cimeira da Aliança Atlântica e os planos de cooperação para o futuro.\nStoltenberg começou por enumerar os compromissos de segurança, destacando o apoio à formação das forças armadas ucranianas. O líder da Aliança lembrou que a NATO vai passar a coordenar toda a assistência à Ucrânia , controlando as atividades a partir de um quartel comandado por um general Aliado e um destacamento de tropas na Alemanha.\nSobre os compromissos financeiros, sublinhou os 40 mil milhões de euros que os chefes de Estado aprovaram entregar a Kiev em 2025 e sobre os compromissos militares, o envio concreto de sistemas de defesa anti-aérea e jatos de combate.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nPara além dos compromissos da NATO , destaca as negociações feitas à margem da Cimeira e os acordos bilaterais que Zelensky assinou durante os últimos dias. “Precisamos de apostar numa maior intraoperabilidade” entre o a Ucrânia, os Estados-membros da NATO e os restantes parceiros, concluiu Stoltenberg.\nJuras de apoio ao “caminho irreversível” da Ucrânia e ameaças sérias de segurança: os destaques da declaração dos líderes da NATO\nTomando a palavra, Zelensky começou, como habitualmente, por agradecer o apoio contínuo dos Estados-membros e do próprio secretário-geral. “Temos de ser resilientes, para que o mundo aceite que as guerras de agressão não são normais”, declarou. Ecoando os compromissos enumerados por Stoltenberg, o Presidente ucraniano ressalvou a esperança de que todos os apoios “cheguem o mais cedo possível à Ucrânia”.\nSobre a multiplicidade de acordos, saudou a “nova arquitetura de defesa para a Ucrânia” que tem vindo a ser construída com a NATO, mas também com o G7 e os restantes parceiros estatais e supranacionais. “Cada acordo que assinamos deixa-nos mais fortes”, afirmou, acrescentando que cada acordo de apoio e cada ajuda entregue à Ucrânia “diminui o apetite de Putin pela agressão”.\nZelensky terminou a sua intervenção referindo a futura adesão da Ucrânia à NATO, que os Aliados consideraram que era “um caminho irreversível”. “Vamos fazer tudo para que chegue o dia em que a Ucrânia é convidada e se torna membro da NATO”, partilhou. Questionado sobre esse mesmo processo, acrescentou: “Estamos muito perto do nosso objetivo. O próximo passo será o convite e depois a adesão”.\n“Se queremos ganhar, devemos levantar todas as restrições” Respondendo às questões dos jornalistas, Stoltenberg e Zelensky voltaram a falar sobre as restrições à utilização de armas ocidentais em territórios russos. O secretário-geral argumentou que a Rússia é que iniciou a guerra e a Ucrânia tem direito a defender-se , direito que inclui a destruição de alvos militares em território russo. O apoio dos Aliados é possível “sem que se tornem parte do conflito”, defendeu. Mas sublinhou que estas decisões são tomadas ao nível estatal.\nJá o Presidente ucraniano voltou a apelar ao fim de todas as restrições , repetindo a ideia que os ataques russos não são limitados e Kiev deve ter capacidade de resposta. “Se queremos ganhar, se queremos prevalecer, se queremos salvar o nosso país e defendê-lo, devemos levantar todas as restrições”, argumentou.\nStoltenberg recusou ainda comentar a notícia, avançada pela CNN, de que a Rússia teria um plano para matar o executivo de uma empresa alemã que fornece equipamento militar a Kiev. Contudo, identificou um “padrão” de tentativas de sabotagem de Moscovo , com o propósito de intimidar os membros da NATO, campanha que diz estar a ter o “efeito oposto”. “O que temos visto é que os Aliados não são intimidados”, declarou.\nQuanto à notícia de que Viktor Orbán vai reunir com Donald Trump esta quinta-feira, Zelensky defendeu que não sabia dos planos do primeiro-ministro húngaro para reuniões na Florida, tal como não sabia das visitas de Orbán a Moscovo ou Pequim. Sobre uma possível segunda visita a Kiev, respondeu: “Isso é entre nós” .\nViktor Orbán reúne-se nesta quinta-feira com Donald Trump na Florida\n Assine o Observador a partir de 0,18€/ dia Não é só para chegar ao fim deste artigo:\nLeitura sem limites, em qualquer dispositivo Menos publicidade Desconto na Academia Observador Desconto na revista best-of Newsletter exclusiva Conversas com jornalistas exclusivas Oferta de artigos Participação nos comentários Apoie agora o jornalismo independente\nVer planos\nOferta limitada\nJá é assinante?

    "text": "The head of Ukraine’s eastern-rite Catholic church on Saturday said a document endorsed by Pope Francis this week permitting blessings for same-sex couples did not apply to his church and its teachings.\nMajor Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the Vatican document “interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church” but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church.\n“Thus … this Declaration applies solely to the Latin Church and has no legal force for the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ,” Shevchuk said in a statement.\nHe said a blessing could not be separated from the church’s teachings and “can in no way contradict the teaching of the Catholic Church about the family as a faithful, indissoluble, and fertile union of love between a man and a woman.”\nThe eastern-rite church worships according to rites similar to the Orthodox faith, but is in communion with Rome by virtue of a 16th century agreement. Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10% of the population of Ukraine.\nThe document from the Vatican’s doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies.\nIt said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage.\nGay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.\nThe post Ukrainian Catholic church rejects Vatican document on same-sex marriages appeared first on NBC News .",
