    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

El Poder Judicial impuso la primera condena en el caso Lava Jato. Después de varios años, [el máximo órgano judicial sentenció a Samuel Campusan](https://larepublica.pe/politica/2024/06/27/pj-condena-a-8-anos-de-carcel-a-samuel-campusano-exfuncionario-del-mef-por-caso-odebrecht-1059912)o, Pedro Cobeñas y Gustavo Montecinos por su rol como intermediarios de las coimas ofrecidas por [Odebrecht](https://larepublica.pe/tag/odebrecht) al Gobierno regional de Cusco. Los tres estuvieron involucrados en el trámite de emisión de bonos soberanos por un valor de S/177 millones. Tras esta primera sentencia condenatoria en juicio oral, el coordinador del Equipo Especial Lava Jato, Rafael Vela, adelantó los próximos procesos en curso. \"Estamos a puertas de un juicio oral trascendente como es el caso de la señora Keiko Fujimori el día lunes (1 de julio) y otras personas acusadas en las instalaciones del Poder Judicial\", dijo durante una entrevista a Canal N. PUEDES VER: [Junta Nacional de Justicia y el Poder Judicial enfrentados por donación de terreno en Chancay] Asimismo, precisó que se vienen los juicios orales de varios personajes mediáticos, tal como el caso de Ollanta Humala, Alejandro Toledo, Jorge Peñaranda. A ello se le suma, el caso del Metro de Lima. \"Estamos llegando a la fase estelar de todos estos procesos. A partir de una estimación de la propia Corte, este año deberíamos tener cinco sentencias definitivas que determinan la culpabilidad o inocencia de los involucrados\", manifestó. De esta forma, Vela confirmó que este 2024, el Tercer Juzgado Penal Colegiado Nacional del Poder Judicial desarrollará la fase estelar del proceso contra la excandidata presidencial.

    "text": "El expresidente del Gobierno José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero ha asegurado este jueves que, en octubre de 2017, [Mariano Rajoy](/tags/mariano-rajoy/), entonces jefe del Ejecutivo, le pidió que hablara con el presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, para que no reconociera la declaración unilateral de independencia (DUI) de Cataluña. En el foro \"España-Cataluña: el encuentro\", organizado por el Grupo Godó, Zapatero ha explicado que \"ayudó\" al Gobierno de Rajoy cuando este le pidió que hiciera gestiones con [Venezuela](/tags/venezuela/) para que no reconocieran la declaración de independencia de Cataluña. \"Cuando gobernó el PP, yo procuré nunca criticar el gobierno de Rajoy; menos fuera. Recuerdo que hasta en algún momento, si me pedían algo, ayudé, por ejemplo, en el procés\", ha señalado. \"Cuando se había declarado la independencia o estaba a punto, me pidieron una gestión para que hablara con Venezuela, con Maduro, por si [Maduro](/tags/nicolas-maduro/) iba a reconocerla o no\", ha explicado el expresidente, que ha señalado que fue el mismo Rajoy quien se lo pidió. [Zapatero](/tags/jose-luis-rodriguez-zapatero/) ha señalado que como expresidente ha procurado siempre \"ayudar en todo\" lo que podía y \"no dar la nota\": \"Los expresidentes al final acumulamos un volumen de defectos muy notables, de egos, de tener tanto poder, de creer que tú lo sabes todo, tenemos un problema que hay que saber gestionarlo\".",

    "title": "任天堂硬件全线涨价，Switch一代售价直逼二代_TOM科技",
    "text": "美国单方面发起的关税大战，对世界经济造成的影响还在继续。本周末，任天堂悄悄提高了美国地区在售的几乎所有主机和配件的价格。好消息是，Switch2成了例外，并没有出现在此次涨价名单之中。\n仔细研究可以发现，任天堂本次的涨价幅度不小，尤其是Switch一代的OLED版本，现在售价已经直逼Switch2，看来老任又给了玩家一个更换主机的理由。\n谈到具体的涨价名单，首先是主机部分，Switch一代全系列都进行了一定幅度的涨价。其中，Switch Lite售价为230美元（原价200美元）、Switch一代标准版售价340美元（原价300美元）、Switch OLED售价400美元（原价350美元）。\n配件方面，从Switch一代的Joy-Con、Pro手柄，以及Switch2的Pro手柄等配件，都有至少5美元的涨幅。\n值得一提的是，任天堂不仅对手柄进行了涨价，连Amiibo、Joy-Con充电底座，以及Switch2扩展坞这样的外围配件也有一定幅度的涨价。虽然涨幅控制在5至10美元，但这样大范围的全线涨价，还是让很多玩家难以接受。\n需要注意的是，本次涨价并不是无迹可寻。美国在7月22日曾宣布对日本进口商品征收15%的关税，而就在上周，任天堂已经表示，该公司的各种Nintendo Switch主机和相关配件的定价将“根据市场情况”在美国地区发生变化。很显然，任天堂此次涨价是为了保留其利润率，将额外的关税成本转嫁给消费者。\n同时，考虑到Switch一代的OLED版本售价接近Switch2，本轮涨价也许还能促使很多老玩家升级，毕竟只剩下50美元的差价了。\n自“特朗普关税”实施以来，任天堂已经在美国地区涨价好几轮，不仅对于一代用户有影响，Switch二代用户同样受到冲击。具体来看，Switch2的Joy-Con和Pro手柄已经有过一轮涨价，现在经过二轮涨价后，售价分别为100美元和90美元，已经超过了最贵的游戏售价。\n很显然，任天堂没有打算将额外关税内部消化，为了不影响利润率，涨价成了最直接的手段。可以预见，如果“特朗普关税”不停下来，任天堂在美国地区会继续涨价。\n【以上内容转自“热点科技网”，不代表本网站观点。 如需转载请取得热点科技网许可，如有侵权请联系删除。】\n延伸阅读：\n盖世汽车2025-08-06 10:5208-06 10:52\n盖世汽车2025-08-06 10:5208-06 10:52",
