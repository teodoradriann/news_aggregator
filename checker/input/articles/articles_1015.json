    "text": "Plastic Re “ Grocery bags ” (Your Views, Dec. 21): The letter denigrating the proposed tax on plastic grocery bags echoes petrochemical industry greenwashing. The statement that plastic bags are easily recyclable is questionable considering the rising awareness of the limitations and outright falsehoods surrounding recycling.\nLike petroleum companies, plastics producers knew decades ago that their products were going to have long-term, negative effects on the environment. Both of these industries took steps to mitigate the potential public backlash. Petroleum companies formed powerful lobbies that worked to deny the effects their products would have on climate change. Plastic producers chose to push the idea of recycling to make the American people believe their wares could be sustainably reused.\nPointedly, the city of Virginia Beach recycling website asks residents to not place plastic bags or films in their curbside containers, the most accessible means of recycling available to citizens. Additionally research indicates that a mere 9% of plastic bags are ever recycled.\nJonathan Byers, Portsmouth\nNonviolence During this Advent season, the world has learned that the Israeli Defense Forces use an artificial intelligence-based system called Habsora (translated as “the Gospel” in English) to rapidly generate lists of targets in Gaza.\nTwo thousand years ago in the same part of the world, the Greek word translated “gospel” (euangelion) meant the “good news” of the Pax Romana, of Roman military victories that were spread by messengers to the ends of the empire.\nEarly in the first century Jewish peasants appropriated the term to describe the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, who embodied the antithesis of warfare and empire. On the backroads of Galilee, Jesus shared his vision of a transformed people who loved their enemies, did good to those who hated them, and sold what they had and gave the money to the poor, loving God and loving other people as themselves. His last words to his community as he was being arrested were to “put up again thy sword.”\nEvery Christmas remembers this one who called followers to share whatever they had and to resist evil nonviolently, no matter the cost, as the way for earth to glimpse heaven. Again this Christmas, his gospel of nonviolent distributive justice and the imperial gospel of violent retributive justice vie for humanity’s devotion.\nSteve Baggarly, Norfolk\nBiden’s mess Re “ GOP obstacle ” (Your Views, Dec. 15): The writer blames Republicans for standing in the way of aid for Ukraine and touts the successes of the Biden administration policies. President Joe Biden is the one who included funds for the U.S. border in the Ukraine and Israel aid package.\nNo one in his or her right mind would vote for funds just to process more migrants. All the president has to do is agree to more actual border security measures (who wouldn’t want that?) and the Ukraine aid will be approved.\nWho can call the mess of Afghanistan a success? I doubt the average Ukrainian thinks what’s going on there is a big success (nor the relatives of the dead Russian soldiers). The people of Israel and Gaza are not cheering the current mess there.\nU.S. soldiers are getting attacked in Syria and Iraq by groups that appear to be encouraged by Iran. The Houthi rebels are routinely attacking international shipping. All these foreign policy “successes” are a direct result of the feckless policies of the Biden administration.\nHere at home the president’s poll numbers belie a success story. Evidence for the low polls is everywhere — just believe your lying eyes.\nHelmut Walter, Yorktown\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "记者　尹成君　报道\n　　北京时间4月9日凌晨,本赛季欧冠四分之一决赛首回合上演了一场充满戏剧性的豪门对决:德甲领头羊拜仁慕尼黑坐镇安联球场迎战意甲榜首国际米兰。这场价值超过15亿欧元的巅峰较量最终以拜仁1:2负于国米定格,拜仁曾在第85分钟时打进扳平的一球,但是国米凭借弗拉泰西的终场绝杀,在客场抢得晋级先机。\n　　本场比赛,缺兵少将的拜仁主帅孔帕尼摆出4231阵型,凯恩突前,奥利塞与萨内分居两翼,基米希和格雷茨卡坐镇中场。尽管拜仁控球率以58%占优,射门20次远超国米的10次,但效率却成为致命短板。反观国米,小因扎吉的352阵型以稳守反击为核心,劳塔罗与图拉姆的双前锋组合屡次通过快速传递撕开拜仁防线。全场比赛,国米仅有四次射正,却打入两球,效率是他们客场取胜的关键。\n　　第38分钟,国米后场长传发起进攻,奥古斯托左路低平传中,图拉姆脚后跟做球,劳塔罗外脚背弹射破门。这个球从发起进攻至破门仅用时12秒,完美地展示了国米反击的犀利。\n　　比赛最后时刻的剧情堪称欧冠经典。第85分钟,基米希将球转移到左路,莱默接球后传中,替补登场的穆勒凌空垫射破门,一度为拜仁点燃希望。然而仅仅3分钟后,国米替补球员弗拉泰西接奥古斯托横传扫射绝杀,彻底扭转了局势。这两粒进球都体现了替补球员的价值,在双方实力旗鼓相当之时,决定球队命运的往往正是那些“奇兵”。\n　　在国米的这几年,劳塔罗越来越成熟,他的外脚背破门是他在本赛季欧冠的第7球,追平国米名宿阿德里亚诺的单赛季纪录,并以19球跻身阿根廷球员欧冠射手榜第六位,他的冷静成为国米客场取胜的基石。\n　　比赛前不久宣布即将离队的穆勒则用进球证明了自己的价值,但其高光时刻仅仅过了三分钟就被弗拉泰西的绝杀掩盖。\n　　拜仁还有戏吗?一球的劣势并不是鸿沟,但德甲巨人如今已是遍体鳞伤,穆西亚拉、戴维斯、诺伊尔等主力球员在第二回合依旧无法及时复出,这将给拜仁在一周后的梅阿查之旅带来不小的困难。\n　　对国米而言,这是重返欧洲之巅的最佳契机,希望他们能牢牢把握机会,不再留有遗憾。足球的世界里,没有永恒的王者,只有永恒的竞争与超越。",

Venezuela claims almost 70% of the territory of the neighboring country, which is rich in oil and other valuable resources.\nVenezuela claims that this territory was ceded to it after gaining independence from Spain, while Guyana considers it to have been part of British Guiana, which later became independent Guyana.\nIn early December, Maduro held a referendum in Venezuela on the annexation of part of Guyana. Just a few days after the referendum, Maduro announced the annexation of the Guyanese territory and presented a new map of the country on television, including the disputed region.\nIn mid-December, Maduro announced that he had reached an agreement with the leader of Guyana to peacefully resolve the dispute and continue negotiations. Both sides stated that they would not use force.\nRead more about the conflict between Venezuela and Guyana and how it may affect Ukraine in the material by RBC-Ukraine.",
