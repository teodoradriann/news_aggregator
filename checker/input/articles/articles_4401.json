    "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\nImpressive Cape Verde have qualified for the round of 16 at the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) after thrashing Mozambique 3-0 on Friday.\nCape Verde now have six points and are Group B winner after just two matches. They will remain top of the group even if they lose their last match to Egypt as they are unassailable.\nBebe opened the scoring for the tiny Island country in the 32nd minute of the match. He sent the ball into the net from a long-distance direct free kick. It went exactly inside the right post.\nCape Verde doubled their lead six minutes into the second half. A mistake from the defence gifted a chance to a lurking Ryan Mendes, who kept his cool and rolled the ball into the net from close range.\nIn the 59th minute of the game, Geny Catamo took a mid-range free kick and his effort flew straight, but crashes against the crossbar.\nMidway into the second half, Cape Verde were 3-0 up. Kevin Lenini scored one of the best goals in his career. His rocket of a shot from distance went straight inside the left post.\nEarlier, Bebe tried his luck from a long-range free kick, but the effort came back off the crossbar.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

    "text": "Situated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, northwest China's Shaanxi Province has promoted ecological conservation and high-quality development along the river, building a \"green miracle\" in the Yellow River basin in the province through relentless efforts.\nPhoto shows a green shelterbelt near watch tower Zhenbeitai in Yulin city, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. [Xinhua/Shao Rui]\nGreening the Loess Plateau\nA vast woodland combining trees, shrubs, and grass stretches out as far as the eye can see at the Mu Us Desert afforestation base in Shenmu, a county-level city administered by Yulin city, located on the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi.\nIt's hard to imagine that the woodland was once a barren desert area plagued by sandstorms years ago. Elders of the area shake their heads remembering the past, stating that sandstorms would sometimes last for days, leaving a layer of sand in their yards that had to be scooped out with dustpans. Today, the main color palette has transformed from “yellow” to “green”.\n\"Now, we systematically monitor wind speed, moisture, microorganisms, etc. in the woodland,\" said Zhang Yinglong, president of the Shenmu ecological protection and construction association and a veteran in desertification control. He added that combating desertification relies on science and technology.\nOver the past 21 years, Zhang and his team have developed a series of afforestation techniques and models. Their process involves three steps. First, planting psammophytes, which are especially adept at growing in sand, to reduce wind erosion; second, planting shrubs to stop migrating sand; and finally planting trees to gradually form a forest. The team, working on an area of 428,000 mu (28,533 hectares), has seen vegetation coverage increase from 3 percent to 65 percent.\nBuilding barriers to protect soil and water\nYulin city has brought 8.6 million mu of shifting sand under control and expanded its forest area from 600,000 mu in the early days of New China to 23.6 million mu today, creating a \"green miracle.\"\nA similar story has unfolded in Yan'an city, also located on the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi, thanks to over two decades of afforestation efforts. Data shows that the city's vegetation coverage has increased from 46 percent in 2000 to 81.3 percent in 2023.\nOver the past few years, Shaanxi has been able to move the border between green and desert northward 400 kilometers. Since 2020, the province has planted nearly 18.36 million mu of trees and tackled over 3.89 million mu of desertified land in the Yellow River basin.\nAn excavator works on enhancing a warp-land dam at the Xindiangou water and soil conservation demonstration park in Suide county, Yulin city, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. [Xinhua/Li He]\nThe rugged terrain of the Loess Plateau at the Xindiangou water and soil conservation demonstration park in Suide county, Yulin is now covered in lush greenery.\nXindiangou, which features loess hills and ravines, was once plagued by water and soil erosion, with huge amounts of mud and sand flowing into the Yellow River.\nTo combat soil erosion, a \"three lines of defense\" management model was formulated.\nThe first line of defense involves constructing terraced fields on the ridges and upper regions of loess hills where the slopes are relatively gentle. Fruit trees and a rotation of grass and crops are planted on the terraced fields to modify the terrain and prevent water and soil erosion.\nThe second line focuses on the cultivation of shrubs along with timber and grass on steep ravine slopes to stabilize hillsides and prevent erosion.\nThe third line emphasizes the construction of warp-land dams, or silt dams, at the bottom of ravines for further flood control, sediment trapping and farming.\nUsing an analogy, the “three lines of defense” equates to putting hats on the ridges by building terraces, dressing the slopes in coats of tree and grass, and boots on the valley bottoms with slit-damns, explained Gao Jianjian, head of the Ecological Engineering Department at the Water and Soil Conservation Bureau of the Yellow River in Suide. Gao went on to say that through decades of effort, 80 percent of the area facing water and soil erosion has been treated, with a forest and grass coverage of more than 75 percent.\nPhoto shows the lush vegetation of Yan'an city, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. [Xinhua/Zhang Bowen]\nXindiangou is a good example of the comprehensive treatment of water and soil erosion taking place in the rest of northern Shaanxi. Data reveals that in 2023, areas in Shaanxi facing water and soil erosion decreased by 1,261 square kilometers compared to the previous year, and its water and soil conservation rate increased to 70.15 percent.\nThe water quality of the Shaanxi section of the Yellow River’s mainstream has reached the Level II standard for two consecutive years, according to an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Development and Reform Commission. An annual average of 4,000 square kilometers of land in the Yellow River basin in the province has been saved from water and soil erosion. The Loess Plateau has become the region with the largest increase in green coverage nationwide.\nThis \"green miracle\" has yielded both ecological and economic benefits. Yan'an city, for example, has 3.32 million mu of apple orchards with an annual apple output of 4.32 million tonnes, accounting for one-third of Shaanxi's apple production and one-ninth of China's total output. Out of the city's population of over 2 million, more than 1 million people are engaged in the apple industry. The sector benefits 800,000 farmers, with apple sales contributing to 61 percent of their operational income.\nDali county in Weinan city, located in the Yellow River basin in Shaanxi, has seen similar success with fruit cultivation. In 2023, the county produced 500,000 tonnes of winter jujubes, and over 300,000 people worked in the winter jujube industry, with farmers earning an average annual income of more than 100,000 yuan.\nIt's not just apples and jujubes. Across the Yellow River Basin in Shaanxi, vegetables, kiwi fruit, and various grains from northern Shaanxi are thriving. From \"ecological beauty\" to \"ecological wealth,\" an increasing number of people are turning green into gold.\n\"As clear waters and green mountains are invaluable assets,\" an official in the Shaanxi Development and Reform Commission affirms, \"we will continue our efforts to comprehensively promote the ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.\"",

    "title": "Viewpoint: Thrift stores can't thrive in Singapore if treated as dumping grounds for fast fashion",
    "text": "SINGAPORE – Trust me when I say that no one is more delighted about the arrival of 2nd Street in Singapore than me.\nA loyal fan since my first trip to Japan in 2023, I have structured entire holidays around thrifting at the store and other popular reuse chains.\nWhen I came down with food poisoning on a four-day trip to Taipei in 2024, I dragged my medicated self out of bed to continue crossing off every 2nd Street outlet I had bookmarked in the city. It was well worth the queasiness because I left with prized finds, including a vintage Prada bag for under $300.\nAnd I am not partial to any one chain. Since I was a teenager trawling flea markets at Scape, I have loved the thrill of the hunt when it comes to shopping pre-loved goods, to add something unique to my wardrobe.\nSo, I have had mixed feelings about the rise of thrift stores, particularly in Singapore.\nLike any phenomenon that starts with good intentions, the growing interest in thrifting has been double-edged. In theory, having more people value second-hand goods helps undo some of the pollution caused by the fashion industry, as it extends the life cycle of an item and keeps it relevant in the market for longer. But the reality is hardly this simple or rosy.\nThrifting does not slow down the appetite for consumption, especially when it is seen only as an “in” thing to do. In fact, as it gains popularity for novelty or perceived coolness, many simply tack a visit to the thrift store on top of existing negative patterns of consumption.\n2nd Street’s buy-and-sell policy, which it is relying on to make up the stock in its Singapore store, is also worrisome.\nFast-fashion culture and easy access to marketplaces like Taobao and Shopee have shaped how a lot of people – particularly the younger generation now interested in thrifting – have grown up. A $3 top is just a tap away; online hauls can now arrive in the same day and be returned the next.\nAs such, many local shoppers still treat second-hand stores as dumping grounds for unwanted goods, to clear out their wardrobes so they can refill with newness.\nIt is why charity shops like Salvation Army have had to turn away donations; why pre-loved stores like Refash – a home-grown thrift shop player that once led the charge in buying and reselling used clothing from shoppers – have become choked with fast-fashion and blogshop brands.\nFew can claim to truly uphold the values behind second-hand shopping – which is to keep fashion circular and reduce new items unnecessarily entering the loop. It seems almost sacrilegious to shop at a thrift store and go home to a wardrobe full of clothes from Shein and Shopee.\nCompare this with the Japanese, who, on top of valuing good brands and local designers, are known for taking good care of their clothes. It is a big factor as to why the stock you see in Japanese reuse stores is still often in pristine condition.\nMoreover, human nature rules that the majority of people will end up competing for the best of the best – which, in a thrift store, is the same small pool of treasured items, designer or not. And how sustainable – pun unintended – can a business be when everyone offloads his or her poor-quality pieces in the same place expected to give gems?\nHours before 2nd Street’s opening day at 313@somerset on April 29, a regular Tuesday morning, winding queues wrapped around the first local outpost in anticipation. I would willingly bet that those in line were there for the debut drop of bargain luxury goods, which many believe will be the best.\nNo second-hand store is exempt from these woes. Mr Raye Padit of swopping platform The Fashion Pulpit (TFP) notes that despite healthy numbers, 30 per cent of its inventory does not get swopped out.\n“It’s stock that is hard to move. Everyone assumes that because our business is about swopping, everything would circulate, but no,” he says.\nTo cope, he funnels this 30 per cent to TFP’s sister label PlayDate, a more Gen Z-focused thrift store, or upcycles them into custom pieces under his label PeyaRework.\nTFP may have found a workaround, but the same cannot be said for all second-hand stores.\nThere is a reason they have had a hard time shaking the stigma attached – thrift stores started out as places for the underprivileged or lower-income to enjoy shopping without strain on their finances. Now that thrifting has evolved into a trend, we not only rob those who need them of decent finds, but we have also capitalised on the system to fill it with junk.\nOf course, that is not to say that people cannot buy fast fashion or cheap first-hand clothing. Rather, it is about adopting the right mentality towards shopping.\nAsk yourself these questions before you troop down with a bag of discards. Are you selling your clothes at flea markets and to stores like 2nd Street and Refash only because they have gone out of style, and to make space for more? What made you buy the piece in the first place if you did not see it lasting in your wardrobe for longer than a year? Will this drop-off be the last?\nWhen you truly buy into the lifestyle of thrifting, you consider every new piece in front of you more consciously, because every new addition feels like a burden.\nGrowing your wardrobe is an individual responsibility people cannot take lightly – if not for the sake of the planet, then at least to maintain the quality and variety in the thrift stores.\n- Amanda Chai is a style correspondent at The Straits Times, where she covers all things fashion, beauty, luxury and retail.\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

    "text": "Solving the world's challenges\nIn Ohio State’s College of Engineering, researchers pursue novel solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, improving lives, advancing industries and driving innovation.\nGovernment funding is crucial to this work. In fiscal year 2024, nearly 62% of the college’s $207.49 million in external research funding came from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health. Industry partners sponsored an additional $63.47 million in collaborative projects.\n“Our faculty, students and staff are contributing to leading research advances across the engineering and architectural disciplines,” said Associate Dean for Research Seth Weinberg. “In turn, support from federal, state and industry funding enables us to tackle increasingly challenging and complex problems facing society.”\nBelow are just a few examples of projects currently underway.\nA new path to clean drinking water\nA chance discovery led Materials Science and Engineering Professor Perena Gouma and her team to develop a new material that can clear water of dangerous pollutants by harnessing the power of sunlight.\nConstructed from titanium dioxide and copper, these lightweight, easy-to-remove fiber mats can float and operate atop any body of water and are even reusable through multiple cleaning cycles. Because nanomats are so effective, researchers envision that they could be used to rid water of industrial pollutants in developing countries, turning otherwise contaminated rivers and lakes into sources of clean drinking water.\n“There hasn’t been an easy way to create something like a blanket that you can lay on water and start creating energy,” Gouma said. “But we are the only ones who have made these structures and the only ones to demonstrate that they actually work.”\nAdditionally, because this technology doesn’t generate any toxic byproducts, nanomats are extremely environmentally friendly. “It’s a safe material, it won’t hurt anything, and it’s as clean as it can be,” said Gouma.\nAlthough this team’s technology is incredibly efficient, how long it will take to scale up commercially depends on how quickly industries take notice. “We have the tools to make them in large quantities and translate them to various industries,” said Gouma. “The only limitation is that it needs someone to take advantage of these abundant resources.”\nThe team’s findings suggest that nanomats could be a promising tool in many future photocatalytic applications, including long-term sustainability efforts like environmental remediation as well as solar-driven hydrogen production. Their work was supported by the National Science Foundation.

This complex personal health data can then be transmitted via Bluetooth to a smartphone for quick and detailed analysis, said Materials Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Jinghua Li, who leads the work.\n“Our bodies carry lots of useful information that we’re not even aware of,” said Li. “These statuses also change over time, so it’s our goal to use electronics to extract and decode those signals to encourage better self health care checks.”\nIt’s estimated that at least 7% of Americans suffer from ambulatory difficulties during activities that include walking, running or climbing stairs. While efforts to manufacture a wearable insole-based pressure system have risen in popularity in recent years, many previous prototypes were met with low energy limitations and unstable performances.\nTo overcome the challenges of their precursors, Li and Qi Wang, a current PhD student in materials science and engineering, sought to ensure that their insole is durable, has a high degree of precision when collecting and analyzing data, and can provide consistent and reliable power.\n“Our device is innovative in terms of high resolution, spatial sensing, self-powering capability, and its ability to combine with machine learning algorithms,” Li said. “So we feel like this research can go further based on the pioneering successes of this field.”\nIn health care, the smart insoles could support gait analysis to detect early abnormalities associated with foot pressure-related conditions (such as diabetic foot ulcers), musculoskeletal disorders (such as plantar fasciitis) and neurological conditions (such as Parkinson’s disease).\nResearchers expect the technology will likely be available commercially within the next three to five years. Next steps to advance the work will be aimed at improving the system’s gesture recognition abilities.

However, these systems do create radioactive waste, which can be dangerous to human health and the environment. Safely disposing of this waste can be challenging.\nUsing a combination of scintillator crystals, high-density materials that emit light when they absorb radiation, and solar cells, the team of Ohio State engineers demonstrated that ambient gamma radiation could be harvested to produce a strong enough electric output to power microelectronics, like microchips.\nThese batteries would be used near where the nuclear waste is produced, such as storage pools or nuclear systems for space and deep sea exploration—they aren’t designed for public use. The battery itself does not incorporate radioactive materials, meaning it is still safe to touch.\n“We're harvesting something considered as waste and by nature, trying to turn it into treasure,” said project lead Raymond Cao, director of Ohio State’s Nuclear Reactor Lab and a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering.\nSince batteries of this type would most likely end up in environments where high levels of radiation already exist and aren't easily accessible to the public, these long-lasting devices wouldn’t pollute their surroundings. Even more significantly, they could also operate without the need for routine maintenance.\nScaling this technology up would be costly unless these batteries could be reliably manufactured, said Cao. Further research is needed to assess the batteries’ usefulness and limitations, including how long they might last once safely implemented, said Ibrahim Oksuz, a research associate in mechanical and aerospace engineering.\n“The nuclear battery concept is very promising,” he said. “There's still lots of room for improvement, but I believe in the future, this approach will carve an important space for itself in both the energy production and sensors industry.”\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Read more about the research.\nOther in-progress research in the College of Engineering includes harnessing generative AI to shape the future of drug design; empowering farmers through AI; advancing metal additive manufacturing, developing a lifesaving, wearable air purifier for miners; and much more.",

Although it was hard to confirm their identity, Han made a controversial claim about it.\n\"Wonbin started dating aespa Giselle when they were a trainee, for her money. I have the photo captured by an anti,\" she wrote, as per a report from a [media outlet](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/riize-wonbin-aespa-giselle-han-seo-hee-dating-rumor-reaction/).\nREAD ALSO: [aespa Giselle & RIIZE Wonbin's Dating Rumors Fueled By Controversial Ex-Trainee Han Seo Hee's Photo + MYs, BRIIZEs Refute Claims](https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/320762/20240723/aespa-giselle-riize-wonbin.htm)\nAt the time, MYs (aespa's fans) and BRIIZEs (RIIZE's fans) dismissed the rumor and called it groundless given Han Seo Hee's infamy.\nHowever, six months later, Giselle and Wonbin were once again speculated to be in a relationship due to their individual messages. In particular, in their recent texts, both idols replaced the word 알게찌 (allgetji) with 알겠찌 (allgejji), which is the cute version of the slang phrase, \"(You) got it?\"\nThese are not formal wordings in South Korea and are barely used as it is considered incorrect.\nIn addition to this, Wonbin and Giselle also put the \"ung\" sound at most of the end of their sentences to make it cuter, but fans raised their suspicions as this is also uncommon to use in South Korea as it has no certain meaning.\nThis time, K-Netizens are now considering that the dating rumor could be true. They expressed their sentiments through the online forum, [Nate Pann](https://m.pann.nate.com/talk/373740881).\n\"It's my first time seeing that kind of speech,\" one commenter said.\n\"When I'm next to someone I like, I start to resemble them in the way they talk. It's similar to that,\" agreed the user.\n\"I don't really believe in things like this, but this one seems really interesting,\" another fan wrote.\n\"Honestly, who would speak like that? I would understand if they are dating, but don't show it to your fans, these idols,\" criticized a netizen.\nRELATED ARTICLE: [aespa Giselle and TREASURE Jihoon Embroiled in Dating Rumors — Find Out Why](https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/317172/20240120/aespa-giselle-treasure-jihoon-embroiled-dating-rumors-find-out-why.htm)",
