    "text": "Bible study behind bars with ‘Pastor Bob’\nClick here for updates on this story\nSALT LAKE CITY, Utah (\nKSTU) — Prison can be a dark, cold and lonely place.\nIt’s a place most people want to avoid.\nBut for more than 30 years, Robert Aguilar walked through the gates of the Utah State Prison willingly in an effort to deliver hope.\n“God has listened and heard my voice in prayer,” Aguilar reads from scripture.\nThe tools of the trade are simple. A kind voice, an open heart, and a Bible.\n“There is a dark area of the prison system and some get tired of it,” Aguilar said. “They want to change and that means it’s from the heart.”\nAguilar began taking his Bible to the Utah State Prison in 1983. It was a way for him to turn his life around.\n“I had a sense of worthlessness because of the life I had been leading previously,” Aguilar said. “I was a heavy drinker. My wife mentioned that she was going to leave me.”\nFaith, Aguilar says, changed his life.\n“I felt like I had something more. We all have something in our lives that calls to that. There is something more important that we can do than just living.”\nIt was that faith that led Aguilar to devote his Sunday mornings as a christian minister — volunteering with prisoners willing to listen.\n“When I walk in they call me ‘Pastor Bob,’ they all know me as Pastor Bob here.\nBryan Taylor is a deputy warden for the prison who oversees volunteers.\n“I actually reached out and talked to some of the inmates out of the prison and they just love him,” Taylor said.\nThe deputy warden says the service provided by Aguilar and prison volunteers is life changing.\n“Individuals when they are locked away and they are contemplating their life – having someone to talk to – that one-on-one communication face-to-face can not be replicated by anything else than doing it,” Taylor said.\nNow 88 years old, Aguilar likes to be with his family, work in his garden, or enjoy a meal at Ogies, his favorite restaurant in West Valley City. It’s a place where he’s reconnected with some former prisoners.\n“I had fellows come in and they tapped me on the back and they say ‘Pastor Bob, you don’t know me, I was in your services and I took on what you told me, what was in scripture that my life could be changed. My life has changed I go to church and I am a happy man and I want to thank you for what you did.’”\nThose moments bring Aguilar joy, knowing his change for the good has helped others find a similar path and bring good to the world.\n“Praise be to God who has not rejected my prayer or has not held his love from me.”\nAguilar says he would have liked to keep going, but the walk in the new prison parking lot is just too much compared to the old facility. He estimates the walk is about a quarter of a mile and he’s afraid he’d fall down and hurt himself.\nStill though, prisoners call him on the phone to maintain communication.\nIf you’re interested in being a volunteer at the Utah State Prison, here is a link:\ncorrections.utah.gov/volunteer/volunteer-programs\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "By Jason Owens, Yahoo Sports December 28, 2023 at 6:52 pm EST\nExpand\nAFC Championship - Cincinnati Bengals v Kansas City Chiefs KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI - JANUARY 29: Ja'Marr Chase #1 of the Cincinnati Bengals reacts as he celebrates completing a pass during the AFC Championship NFL football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Cincinnati Bengals at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on January 29, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images) (Michael Owens/Getty Images)\nBy Jason Owens, Yahoo Sports December 28, 2023 at 6:52 pm EST The Cincinnati Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs have beef fueled by high-stakes battles in a split of the last two AFC championship games.\nThe 2023 stakes are muted thanks to Joe Burrow's season-ending wrist injury. But that's not stopping Ja'Marr Chase from adding \"fire to the fuel\" ahead of Sunday's game. The All-Pro Bengals receiver went out of his way on Thursday to take shots at the Kansas City defense.\n\"I know what I see on paper. I know what I see in game,\" Chase told reporters of the Chiefs defense. \"That's why they double everybody. 'Cause they can't do it one on one.\n\"The best player on their team is [cornerback L'Jarius] Sneed. That's a fact. Everybody knows that. That's why they double everything they see. ... They know I'm good. They know how to play us. It's not like they've got a superstar on their defense.\"\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023 Neither Sneed nor Chase are sure to play on Sunday. Sneed's been sidelined at practice this week with a calf strain. Chase has been limited by a lingering shoulder injury that sidelined him last week. But he sounds ready to challenge the Kansas City secondary if he can go with no concern for providing bulletin-board material.\n\"I'm just adding fire to the fuel right now,\" Chase continued. \"They're gonna take this, run with it. Hope they put it in their locker.\"\nAt 9-6, this is not a vintage Chiefs team. They're seeking to clinch the AFC West on Sunday after blowing an opportunity to do so in a stunning Christmas Day loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. But their defense is excellent. Kansas City enters Week 17 ranked second in total defense and third against the pass. Chase is poking a quite capable bear.\nHe also has the receipts to back up his talk. Chase has made the Pro Bowl in each of his two NFL seasons and posted a career game with 266 yards and three touchdowns in 2021 against Kansas City. The 8-7 Bengals will need him Sunday as they fight to keep their dwindling playoff hopes alive.",

Furthermore, the army fired a missile at a shed where displaced Palestinians tried to shelter in the Nusseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, causing many injuries. At least one Palestinian was killed and several others injured, when the army fired artillery shells at the Al-Mufti area, north of Nusseirat refugee camp.

In northern Gaza, the army fired a missile at a home in the Shaima area in Beit Lahia, wounding several Palestinians, including children and women. The Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza said the Israeli army continues to refuse to allow its medics and rescue teams to search under the rubble of the bombarded home for the Abu Hadrous family since Wednesday and affirmed that sixteen Palestinians remain under the rubble. It added that it contacted the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, regarding the Abu Hadrous family, but “they failed to act despite all appeals.” On its part, the Israeli army said, on Thursday evening, that one soldier was killed in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, bringing the number of soldiers and officers, killed since October 7, 2023, to 695. UN United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said on her X account “Under the guise of #ceasefire negotiations, Israel is trying to create the conditions for permanent occupation and more land grab,” and added, “Those familiar with Palestine’s history recognize in what is happening to the Palestinians under Israel’s unlawful occupation, the pattern of settler colonialism.” History repeats itself: Israel using negotiations to eat up other portions of what remains of Palestine Under the guise of “ [#ceasefire]negotiations” Israel is trying to create the conditions for permanent occupation and more land grab.

In related news, UNRWA said that the Israeli army forcefully displaced 250,000 Palestinians, yet again, as it continues the war on Gaza. “So far in August, the Israeli authorities issued 12 evacuation orders affecting around 250,000 people in Gaza,” UNRWA said on X platform, “Families are repeatedly displaced, carrying what they can amid military operations and summer heat.

In a post on X social media platform, the Commission said that there is currently no safe place within the Gaza Strip and added that the displaced Palestinians in Gaza remain confined to an area that constitutes only one-tenth of the Gaza Strip’s total space. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Israel has committed four massacres of families in the Gaza Strip in 24 hours, killing at least 42 Palestinians and injuring 163, largely children and women, across the coastal enclave. Israel has now killed at least 40.265 and injured more than 93.144, mostly children, women, and elderly, in addition to the thousands of missing Palestinians, mostly under the rubble of bombarded homes and buildings, on destroyed streets and in bombarded alleys across the Gaza Strip, since October 7, 2023.",
