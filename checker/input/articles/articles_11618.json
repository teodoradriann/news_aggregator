    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n近年来，中国与柬埔寨在两国领导人的战略引领下，建立了牢不可破的“铁杆友谊”。双方在“钻石六边”架构下的务实合作不断深化，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进，各领域合作成果丰硕，为两国人民带来了切实利益，成为“合作共赢、共同繁荣”的典范。习近平主席即将对柬埔寨进行国事访问，访问期间，双方将探讨提升中柬关系新定位，就政治互信、互利合作、安全保障、人文交流、战略协作五大领域深入交换意见。相信此次访问将进一步提升中柬两国的战略互信，推动两国各领域全方位的深入合作，为构建高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代中柬命运共同体注入强劲动力。\n柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所所长金平近日在接受经济日报专访时表示，柬中两国传统友谊源远流长，最早可追溯到13世纪。自1958年7月19日两国建交以来，在历代领导人的精心呵护下，柬中友好合作关系经受住了历史的考验。2010年，两国建立全面战略合作伙伴关系。2019年，中国和柬埔寨签署《构建中柬命运共同体行动计划》（2019—2023），柬埔寨成为首个同中国签署构建命运共同体行动计划的国家。2020年，中国与柬埔寨正式签署自由贸易协定，并于2022年正式生效。2023年，双方达成“钻石六边”合作架构协议，签署了《构建新时代中柬命运共同体行动计划（2024—2028）》。这一系列的制度化安排，大大增强了两国关系的韧性和稳定性，为今后的合作拓展了更广阔的空间。\n经贸合作已成为两国关系的基石。中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴。中柬自贸协定显著加大了柬农产品和制成品的市场准入，有力促进了双边贸易增长。根据柬埔寨海关总署发布的统计数据，2024年，中柬贸易额达到151亿美元，同比增长23.8%。其中，柬对华出口额达17.5亿美元，同比增长18%；柬自中国进口额达134.3亿美元，同比增长24.6%。2024年在柬埔寨批准的国内外投资项目中，中国投资占到协议总投资额的49.8%。\n与此同时，共建“一带一路”倡议也为柬基础设施、能源建设和数字经济发展等作出显著贡献。中柬共建的柬埔寨西哈努克港经济特区已吸引200多家国际企业和机构入驻，创造了3.2万个就业岗位；中企建设运营的柬埔寨首条高速公路——金边至西哈努克港高速公路，将两地通行时间从5小时以上缩短至不到2小时；暹粒吴哥国际机场助力旅游业快速增长，截至去年年底，已开通至8个国家的17条航线。共建“一带一路”框架下的重点项目以及“工业发展走廊”“鱼米走廊”建设对柬经济社会发展起到了重要作用。\n双方将“钻石六边”合作与柬“五角战略”对接，在深化经贸合作基础上，不断扩大在教育、文化、旅游、扶贫、医疗援助及军事和安全等领域的合作，两国党际交流、官方和民间团体交流频繁，两国的务实合作有力促进了中柬民心相通。可以说，在柬埔寨的发展之路上，处处可见“中国印记”，这种双边合作的广度和深度，在柬埔寨对外关系史上前所未有，堪称发展中国家之间合作共赢的典范。\n中柬两国一贯倡导多边主义、国际关系民主化，共同致力于建立更加公平的国际秩序，坚定维护国际规则和公平正义，反对霸权主义、强权政治，反对单边主义和贸易保护主义。面对变乱交织的国际局势，中国提出了构建周边命运共同体的倡议，作为友好邻邦，柬埔寨各界对此表示欢迎。两国有望进一步深化双边合作，共同维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，在实现全球治理改革的共同承诺中加强战略合作，共同应对全球性挑战。（本文来源：经济日报 作者：王 涛）\n（责任编辑：冯虎）",

    "text": "Dear EA Support Team,\nREPORT PLAYER:[Edit]\nI am compelled to bring to your attention a grave incident involving conduct that flagrantly violates the community standards and ethical gaming norms in Apex Legends.\nDuring a recent gaming session, a player displayed appalling misconduct. This individual not only abstained from any form of teamwork but also resorted to extreme verbal abuse.\nThe language used was shockingly offensive, including blatant slurs directed at transgender individuals and the use of deeply racist terms such as the N-word.\nThis behaviour goes beyond mere poor sportsmanship; it represents a disturbing display of bigotry and hate speech.\nAlthough the attached video is only a segment of the entire incident due to file size restrictions, it provides irrefutable evidence of this deplorable behaviour. It insults the diverse and inclusive community that EA and Apex Legends strive to foster. By allowing such actions to go unchecked, we risk normalizing hate speech and discrimination, inflicting profound distress on marginalized groups, especially the LGBTQ+ community. In light of this, I urge you to conduct a swift and thorough review of this incident and enforce the appropriate disciplinary measures, including considering an immediate and permanent ban on the player's account. The integrity of Apex Legends as a safe and respectful gaming environment is at stake.\nFurthermore, I intend to share this incident across social media platforms to promote accountability and ensure community safety.\nThis is not just about one player's misconduct but about taking a stand against toxicity and discrimination in the gaming world.\nI trust that EA will respond with the seriousness this matter demands and uphold the values of respect and inclusivity that are fundamental to the gaming community.\nThank you for your immediate attention to this pressing issue.\n[Edit: Naming and shaming is against AHQ tos, please don't.

    "text": "—Largest Global Clinical Trial Ever Conducted in Bronchiectasis Demonstrates Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful Reduction in Frequency of Pulmonary Exacerbations Versus Placebo—\n—Brensocatib 25 mg is the First Investigational Therapy for Bronchiectasis to Show a Statistically Significant Reduction in the Rate of Lung Function Decline—\n—Brensocatib is Currently Under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J. , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today announced that positive results from the pivotal phase 3 ASPEN study of brensocatib in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The landmark ASPEN study is the largest clinical trial ever conducted in bronchiectasis, a serious, chronic, and progressive inflammatory pulmonary disease that today has no approved therapies.\n\"Bronchiectasis is a debilitating disease characterized by pulmonary exacerbations, which contribute to lung function decline and severely impact quality of life,\" said lead author James Chalmers , MBChB, PhD, Professor and Consultant Respiratory Physician at the School of Medicine, University of Dundee , UK. \"With limited treatment options and no approved therapies, the burden of exacerbations remains high, with many patients experiencing multiple episodes each year. For the first time, the ASPEN data published in NEJM demonstrates that a treatment which targets inflammation can reduce exacerbations and slow the rate of lung function decline. This is an exciting development and represents a potentially transformative breakthrough for people living with bronchiectasis, offering new hope for patients with this challenging condition if brensocatib is approved.\"\nAs previously reported, the ASPEN study met its primary endpoint, with both brensocatib doses achieving statistical and clinical significance for the reduction in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations versus placebo over the 52-week treatment period. The annualized rate of exacerbations was 1.02 for brensocatib 10 mg, 1.04 for brensocatib 25 mg, and 1.29 for placebo. These rates were significantly lower in the brensocatib 10 mg and 25 mg groups versus placebo with rate ratios of 0.79 (adjusted P=0.004) and 0.81 (adjusted P=0.005), respectively.\nBoth dosage strengths of brensocatib also met several exacerbation-related secondary endpoints, including significantly prolonging the time to first exacerbation and significantly increasing the proportion of patients remaining exacerbation-free over the treatment period. Patients treated with brensocatib 25 mg also showed significantly lower lung function decline at week 52 as measured by post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1).\nBrensocatib was well-tolerated in the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 5.0% of patients treated with either dose of brensocatib and more frequently than in placebo were COVID-19 (15.8%, 20.9%, 15.8%), nasopharyngitis (7.7%, 6.3%, 7.6%), cough (7.0%, 6.1%, 6.4%), and headache (6.7%, 8.5%, and 6.9%) for brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, and placebo, respectively.\n\"Currently, people with bronchiectasis have no approved treatments to address the frequent, damaging exacerbations that are the hallmark of this disease,\" said Martina Flammer , M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Insmed. \"Brensocatib has the potential to be the first approved therapy to fill this critical unmet need in the care of patients with bronchiectasis, as well as the first approved dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor—a new mechanism of action with the potential to address a range of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. The ASPEN trial represents a transformative step forward for the millions of people globally diagnosed with bronchiectasis.\"\nBrensocatib is currently under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a target action date of August 12, 2025 , under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).\nAbout ASPEN\nThe total number of active sites in ASPEN was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to <18 years) were randomized 2:2:1 for treatment with brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks, followed by 4 weeks off treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included data from 1,680 adult patients and 41 adolescent patients.\nAbout Bronchiectasis\nBronchiectasis is a serious, chronic lung disease in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Today, approximately 500,000 patients in the U.S., 600,000 patients in the EU5 ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and UK), and 150,000 patients in Japan have been diagnosed with bronchiectasis, and there are currently no approved therapies specifically targeting bronchiectasis in these regions.\nAbout Brensocatib\nBrensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.\nAbout Insmed\nInsmed Incorporated is a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases. The Company is advancing a diverse portfolio of approved and mid- to late-stage investigational medicines as well as cutting-edge drug discovery focused on serving patient communities where the need is greatest. Insmed's most advanced programs are in pulmonary and inﬂammatory conditions, including a therapy approved in the United States , Europe , and Japan to treat a chronic, debilitating lung disease. The Company's early-stage programs encompass a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue.\nHeadquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey , Insmed has offices and research locations throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan.

    "text": "La Fiscalía de la Nación, a través del Área de Enriquecimiento Ilícito y Denuncias Constitucionales, presentó una denuncia constitucional contra Pedro Castillo. El expresidente enfrenta los presuntos delitos de negociación incompatible o aprovechamiento indebido del cargo y nombramiento ilegal. Mediante redes sociales, el Ministerio Público informó este jueves 27 de junio que se presentó formalmente la acusación contra Castillo Terrones. De acuerdo con la fiscalía, el exmandatario es denunciado por nombrar al expresidente del Congreso, Daniel Salaverry, como presidente del directorio de Perupetro S.A. el 9 de enero del 2022 “pese a que no cumplía con los requisitos legales para el cargo”. Luego del nombramiento de Salaverry en el cargo, y los cuestionamientos a Pedro Castillo por esta decisión, el excongresista presentó su irrevocable renuncia al cargo. Sin embargo, afirmó que sí podría ocupar el cargo a la cabeza del directorio de Perupetro, pese al informe de Contraloría que había observado dicha decisión. “No seré el pretexto para que los adversarios sigan generando inestabilidad política al país por sus oscuros intereses”, indicó Salaverry en su carta de renuncia el 25 de enero del 2022.

    "text": "Key Points\nRishabh Pant appointed as LSG captain with innovative leadership\nZaheer Khan endorses team's aggressive cricket strategy\nLSG aims to challenge traditional playing methods\nPant's resilience key to team's positive outlook\nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the former Indian seamer emphasized the team's intent to take the game head-on, reflecting the leadership style of their newly appointed skipper.\n\"You will see a fearless approach from this team,\" Zaheer stated, highlighting the mindset LSG aims to bring to the tournament.\nAddressing concerns over injuries, Zaheer dismissed any negativity, pointing to Pant's resilience as a key factor in shaping the team's attitude.\n\"We are not talking about injuries. The captain himself has faced similar challenges, but he has a very positive outlook. The way he approaches the game, the way he puts pressure on the bowlers--you will see LSG play in that manner because the leader sets the tone,\" he said.\nPant has been entrusted with leading the franchise this season. Zaheer expressed confidence in his ability to guide the team forward.\n\"We have a very good captain who has been appointed this year to take the team forward. There is a lot of hope from him,\" he noted.\nPant's IPL journey with LSG could not be more poetic as he would start off his campaign as LSG's skipper against his former side Delhi Capitals at Visakhapatnam on March 24.\nPant has represented Delhi Capitals (DC) for his entire IPL career since 2016, scoring 3,284 runs in 110 matches at an average of 35.31, with a century and 18 fifties. He was appointed as the team's captain in 2021 and led them to playoffs in the same season. He was let go by the franchise in 2024 ahead of the mega auction and became the league's most expensive player ever at Rs 27 crore, bought by LSG, who later appointed him as a captain too in January. While there are speculations over his batting position, one thing is for sure, Pant fans are up for a thrilling ride!\nPant was also a part of India's ICC Champions Trophy winning team recently, however, he did not get to play a match. Pant has not featured in any white-ball game for India since August and a bumper IPL season could make him India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter again.",
