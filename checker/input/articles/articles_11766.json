    "text": "If a family with four members switch to rainwater harvesting each family members will have access to about 130 litres of water a day, and the water will be free following the initial investment to establish a rainwater harvesting system,\nTanuja Ariyananda of the Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum (LRWHF) said during a recent seminar organised by the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL).About 40 percent of Sri Lankans still depend on wells, springs and other natural sources to meet the daily water requirement, she said.Given climate change these individuals may face problems accessing quality water in the future, she said.\n“There has been a great interest in this system for the past 30 years. Now around the world there are about 160 million people who benefit from this system. They use this for domestic consumption,” she said.\nAriyananda said rainwater harvesting is important to Sri Lanka because water stress is growing due to human activity, urban development, pollution, etc. Droughts and floods have both become more frequent and both affect access to clean water, she said.\n“Sri Lankans in many parts of the country can benefit from rainwater harvesting. This can benefit people in arid and semi-arid areas as well as those living in high elevation. It will also help people who use ground water of poor quality. We must not forget that some researchers link arsenic and fluoride in ground water to CKDu,” she said.\nMost Sri Lankans are now crippled with high cost of living and rainwater harvesting saves money by reducing the water bill by up to 60 percent. It can also save the electricity bill by reducing the need to operate water motors, etc., she said.\nAriyananda said 60 percent of the rain that falls in the wet zone of the country is wasted as run off. The number is 40 percent in the dry zone, she said.She added that Sri Lanka has about 50,000 rainwater harvesting systems installed.\nAriyananda said a resident of Colombo with a roofing area of 100 square metres can collect about 192,000 litres of rainwater in a year. The number if 147,200 litres of rainwater for Kandy, 102,400 litres of rainwater in Anuradhapura, 83,900 litres of rainwater in Hambantota, 98,400 litres of rainwater in Jaffna and 300,000 litres of rainwater in Ratnapura, she said.\n“If we take the case of Colombo and if we assume there are four people in the family, we can collect about 130 litres of water per person per day. This probably exceeds the daily requirement of a person,” she said.\nAriyananda said there are about 340 schools in Colombo and that the average roof area of a school is 1,000 square metres. The annual rainwater that can be collected by the Colombo schools is 548,800 cubic metres. If we calculate the value of water at 60 rupees a cubic meter, it comes to 32,928,000 rupees,” he said.\nShe added that some Sri Lankans are concerned about the quality of rainwater. A WHO study in 2017 found that the quality of harvested rainwater is second only to piped water. The quality of harvested rainwater is better than water from bore holes, protected springs and dug wells, according to the WHO research.\nAriyananda said a private higher education institution in Malambe recently started harvesting rainwater from a roof area of 5,525 square meters and that the collected water was adequate to meet 75 percent of the total water demand of the university.\n“Imagine the savings this establishment made,” she said.\nShe said that there is a high initial cost to set up a rainwater harvesting system. The initial cost may be daunting, especially if someone is from a poor community.\n“However, the state spends about 1.5 million rupees to give a water connection. But we can build a rainwater harvesting system for Rs 200,000 rupees. Then the household gets free water afterwards. The state can save money by giving rainwater harvesting systems to people,” she said.",

    "title": "Harvesting Hope: Reflecting on Trinidad and Tobago’s agricultural landscape - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday",
    "text": "[Business](https://newsday.co.tt/category/business) Harvesting Hope: Reflecting on Trinidad and Tobago’s agricultural landscape [Newsday](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/real-time) BAVINA SOOKDEO Agriculture is the backbone of economies worldwide, serving as a fundamental source of sustenance, employment and economic growth. Beyond providing essential food resources, the agricultural sector contributes significantly to a nation’s GDP. The interplay of farming activities not only fuels agribusinesses but also establishes a vital link in the global supply chain. With its multifaceted impact, agriculture remains a cornerstone for economic stability, ensuring food security, fostering innovation and supporting livelihoods across diverse communities. As the year comes to a close, we sought to find out what 2023 held for farmers and vendors and what their hopes are for 2024. A farmer from Debe, aged 65, reflects on over four decades cultivating the land. Planting eddoes, bodi, baigan, ochro, and seim, the farmer witnesses the intricate dance between nature’s bounty and the challenges of sustaining a livelihood. The farmer, who sells produce at the Debe and Penal markets, spoke of the hurdles faced by those who toil in the fields, particularly during 2023. Navigating the intricate balance of weather patterns, this year proved to be a tapestry woven with triumphs and tribulations for him. He pointed out that the ebb and flow of weather conditions coupled with fungal diseases posed formidable challenges. The farmer said, “For small seasonal periods such as Divali, when vegetables are in high demand, there are sometimes many challenges with the weather and this could severely impact on such a favourable period for farmers.” One of the perennial challenges stems from the nefarious activities of praedial larcenists. The farmer lamented, “Bandits are very smart in their stealing activities.” Theft not only disrupts the delicate equilibrium of supply and demand but also undermines the hard work and dedication farmers invest in their craft. Access to resources The farmer’s insights delve deeper into systemic issues. Accessing grants and loans, crucial for the sustenance and expansion of their operations, proves to be a formidable challenge for low-level farmers. “The system is corrupted and flood damages go to people who are not proper farmers,” he says. Looking toward the horizon of 2024, the seasoned farmer articulates a vision for the future of agriculture in TT. Urgent calls are being made for improvements in access roads and market facilities. He explained that greater assistance is provided by private agricultural supply companies such as Caribbean Chemicals Ltd. The farmer emphasises the need for a re-evaluation of the support provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and its extension officers. He raised concerns about the efficacy of the current market dynamics. The absence of proper laybys for farmers to drop off goods, inconvenient market hours in Debe and conditions favourable to middle-men are focal points of contention. The farmer advocates for a more equitable distribution of assistance to those who toil the land. In addressing the issue of side-road vendors contributing to the illicit trade of stolen goods, the farmer proposes a pragmatic solution. “If these vendors are to be moved they should be given proper places to sell their goods,” the farmer said. Amidst the challenges, the farmer draws strength from the intrinsic rewards of the profession. Beyond the toils and tribulations, the journey of a farmer is marked by self-satisfaction and contentment. As the farmer poignantly says, “The rewards of being a farmer include self-satisfaction, contentment by producing goods which is the main sustainer of life to people.” In the enduring spirit of TT's agricultural community, this resilient farmer exemplifies the determination to overcome challenges and sow the seeds of sustenance for generations to come. 2023 agricultural offerings A seasoned vegetable vendor of St Helena also shared his thoughts on the agricultural offerings for 2023. This vendor, aged 58, was previously a farmer and comes from generations of farmers. Born into a legacy of cultivation, the vendor narrates a tale of resilience, adapting from planting pumpkin, seim, baigan, sweet pepper and lettuce to exclusively vending produce sourced from the wholesale market in Macoya. He said, “Cattle used to trample up on my goods, thieves stole them and chemicals also started to get more expensive, so I stopped planting. Now, I only sell produce at the Tunapuna market.” Selling beets, apples, grapes, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, garlic, onions, red onions, potatoes, pumpkins, sweet peppers, cabbages and more, the vegetable vendor describes 2023 as a mixed bag. “Not so bad, some days were slow and some days were good,” he said. However, challenges loom large, with crime, flooding, fluctuating prices, rising cost of fertilisers and pesticides, and plant diseases casting shadows on the daily journey. The vendor’s resilience shines through as he navigates unpredictable weather, early morning market queues and the persistent spectre of crime, all with unwavering faith. Stating that vendors are usually overlooked in the grant landscape, he explained that they grapple with the rising demand for market stalls as more individuals seek economic avenues in the face of job losses. “All the stalls are sold out now, long ago was easy, but now, because more people are going to the market to sell... stalls are difficult to get,” he said. Market dynamics come into focus as the vendor elaborates on pricing intricacies. Balancing the delicate equilibrium between affordability and profitability, the vendor notes, “Prices right now are not too cheap and not too expensive.” The ebb and flow of sales, influenced by market competition and changing consumer patterns, presents challenges and opportunities. “When goods are too cheap, I do not make a lot of money, when it is too high, sometimes we make money, or we lose big (dependent on how the goods are packed and if we get them sold),” he explained. He further pointed out that sales have dropped significantly because groceries are selling more market items and there are more roadside sheds, giving market vendors competition. Expectations for 2024 Peering into the future, the vendor expresses hope for 2024, yearning for higher prices to alleviate the financial burdens faced by many. “In 2024, we are hoping that the price of goods is a little higher so we can make a profit. Plenty people are not working, they have to pay land and building tax and electricity cost has gone up – people have a lot of expenses now, but it is my hope that it is still a good year for us,” he said. Questioned on the rewards of his profession, the vendor explained that while there are not many benefits, it does allow him to provide for himself and his family. In the national budget for fiscal 2024, Finance Minister Colm Imbert said that the goal is to make the agricultural sector tax-free. He added that the Government also aims to review, update and improve, where necessary, all concessions, incentives and rebates in the sector, such as the fuel rebate for fishermen, to make them more realistic and relevant. A further $400 million has been allocated to aid the agricultural sector, comprised of $250 million in incentives to farmers and $150 million for the development of infrastructure through the Palo Seco Agricultural Enterprises Company. Also discussed in the budget are plans for $7.5 million to be allocated to community gardens and green markets; the revitalisation of the coffee industry, including efforts to rejoin the International Coffee Organisation and support for cocoa farmers and entrepreneurs; rehabilitation and replanting of 900 acres of coconut to boost the coconut industry; strengthening the praedial larceny squad to reduce incidents across all districts; rehabilitation of physical infrastructure at Plum Mitan, benefiting 150 rice farmers; rehabilitation of 240 km of access roads for farming districts and forestry access roads to enhance harvesting operations; upgrades for fish landing sites and wholesale fish markets to expand entrepreneurial opportunities and provide training in processing initiatives; establishment of an agri-processing facility for alternatives to wheat flour and pepper mash, along with refurbishing the storage facility at the Piarco Packing House and the establishment of community-based aquaculture programmes to boost production in the aquaculture sector.",

    "text": "Tecnología y sociedad\nLa IA ya está ocupando puestos de trabajo: chatbots y profesionales freelance\nLos chatbots han reducido en un 21% la demanda de profesionales freelance, sobretodo en tareas más rutinarias que creativas\nPablo Javier Piacente\nDesde el auge de la Inteligencia Artificial (IA), y más aún luego de la popularización de ChatGPT y otras aplicaciones de chatbot, la demanda de algunas especialidades laborales relacionadas con la creación de contenidos, la programación o la entrada de datos ha sufrido un importante descenso, según un nuevo estudio. Los resultados confirman que se requerirá una combinación de nuevas estrategias profesionales por parte de los trabajadores y de iniciativas de seguridad social encaradas por estados y organizaciones civiles para reducir el impacto de los cambios.\nUn equipo de científicos de la Universidad de Harvard, en Estados Unidos, el Instituto Alemán de Investigación Económica y el Imperial College de Londres, en el Reino Unido, estudiaron casi un millón y medio de puestos de trabajo solicitados en un importante portal de profesionales independientes a nivel global, desde julio de 2021 hasta julio de 2023, y revelaron que la demanda de las posiciones freelance propensas a la automatización cayó un 21%, solamente ocho meses después del lanzamiento de ChatGPT, a fines de 2022.\nEl documento, publicado en OpenRead y SSRN, analiza el impacto de las tecnologías de Inteligencia Artificial (IA) en la demanda de trabajadores independientes online utilizando un gran conjunto de datos de una plataforma líder, cuyo nombre no fue revelado. Los científicos identificaron los tipos de trabajos que se ven más afectados por la IA generativa y cuantificaron la magnitud del impacto en ese mercado laboral específico.\nUn fuerte impacto\nLos hallazgos muestran una disminución del 21% en el número de puestos de trabajo con posibilidad de ser automatizados mediante la [IA](https://www.levante-emv.com/tendencias21/2024/09/30/confirmado-ia-cambiando-inteligencia-colectiva-108740473.html), principalmente en las tareas de carácter más rutinario ligadas a la creación y redacción de contenidos, la codificación y programación, el diseño y el ingreso de datos, entre otras especialidades.\nAnalizando en concreto algunos detalles, observaron que la introducción de tecnologías de [IA](https://www.levante-emv.com/tendencias21/2024/09/16/ia-cambiar-opinion-creyentes-fervorosos-108219108.html) para la generación de imágenes condujo a una disminución significativa del 17% en el número de puestos de trabajo relacionados con la producción visual para proyectos digitales. A través de la herramienta Google Trends, pudieron demostrar que la disminución más pronunciada en la demanda de profesionales freelance dentro de los secores indicados se relaciona directamente con el crecimiento de la popularidad y el concimiento de las potencialidades de ChatGPT y otros sistemas similares.\nDesafíos y nuevas oportunidades al mismo tiempo\nSegún un [artículo](https://www.fastcompany.com/91229781/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-research-shows-routine-tasks-are-the-first-to-go) publicado en Fast Company, los especialistas sostienen que los responsables de políticas públicas y directores de organizaciones sociales deberán promover el acceso equitativo a oportunidades de educación y capacitación, apoyar a los trabajadores desplazados a través de redes de seguridad social y llevar adelante programas de reempleo, entre otras posibles medidas.\nPor último, TechRadar [informa](https://www.techradar.com/pro/chatgpt-has-caused-a-massive-drop-in-demand-for-online-digital-freelancers-here-is-what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself) que los investigadores subrayaron en el estudio que aunque el mercado laboral parece sombrío para algunas especialidades, al mismo tiempo surgirán nuevas profesiones, como ya ha sucedido durante cambios tecnológicos previos. Al mismo tiempo, muchos profesionales lograrán adaptar sus habilidades al nuevo entorno y mantendrán sus empleos, saliendo incluso fortalecidos al volcarse a tareas más creativas o analíticas, que la IA aún no logra dominar.\nReferencia\n[Who is AI Replacing?

    "text": "Io e la mia famiglia siamo stati profughi di guerra; obbligati nel 1942 a abbandonare la nostra casa a Tripoli per rimpatriare e siamo stati in viaggio in treno 3 giorni e 3 notti, giungendo a Parma il 18 di febbraio sera, verso le 20.\nCi attendevano due gentili signore che ci accompagnarono in un modesto ma pulito albergo nei pressi della Stazione Ferroviaria.\nEravamo mia madre e 7 fratelli: e il maggiore ero io; poi veniva mia sorella Salvina, seguita da 5 altri fratelli, tutti minori di età.\nL’indomani ci accompagnarono Al’E.C.A. (Ente Comunale di Assistenza) che, in teoria, doveva prendersi cura di noi dichiarati profughi di guerra.\nIn realtà il funzionario addetto alla bisogna era tutto un chera, mi an so cofer e il problema più grosso per lui era trovarci un alloggio e…lo trovò ricorrendo alla CIBIA di BORGO Pietro Cocconi n° 38 in Oltretorrente.,altrimenti detto Parma Vecia.\nPer noi che venivamo – si può dire – da un altro mondo ci colpirono anzitutto la modestia dell’aspetto degli avventori fatta di suonatori ambulanti, mendicanti, donne che avevano un …passato e la proprietaria e gestrice ci accompagnò in una ampio camerone (nostro futuro alloggio con al centro una stufa che fungeva da cucina e riscaldamento insieme).\nQualche giorno dopo ci dettero dei buoni per acquistare, con essi, in un negozio sito allora in Piazzale Filippo Corridoni, capi di vestiario visto che partendo da Tripoli – ci avevano proibito di portarne dei nostri dicendo che sull’aereo il carico era già al massimo e comunque in Italia avremmo trovato tutto l’occorrente….\nBorgo Pietro Cocconi appartiene al complesso di Oltretorrente – -detto anche Parma Vecchia- e ha una sua particolare collocazione nella storia di strade e luoghi antifascisti di Parma.\nPoi, nell’attuale Piazza Picelli, come ogni anno e come da tradizione si teneva la Fiera di San Giuseppe con le tradizionali giostre; e le automobiline-scontro, ecc. i cui gestori arrivavano alcuni giorni prima della ricorrenza per montare il loro armamentario e quant’altro usava in dette occasioni.\nPer i giovani era un’occasione attesa tutto l’anno perché dava modo di stare assieme tra loro …e fu così che un giorno di quella ricorrenza a me e mia sorella Salvina apparve una splendida ragazza: bionda, occhi azzurro – verdi. Dimostrava una vitalità incredibile che ti inculcava immediata simpatia: diventare amici con Ida fu tutt’uno, visto che alla sua prorompente vitalità si accompagnava il fatto che noi venivamo dall’Africa e eravamo… moretti.\nIn particolare si legarono di solida amicizia mia sorella e Ida che prese a chiamare Bruna mia sorella anziché Salvina e, anche per volere di mia sorella tutti la chiamarono per l’innanzi … Bruna.\nA me piacque subito la disinvoltura e la vitalità della nuova nostra amica e l’invito a venire a trovarci a casa (si fa per dire… ) fu subito accettato da lei.\nLa ragazza piacque molto a nostra madre.\nCon il suo carattere franco e sincero del resto non poteva essere diversamente.\nCol passar dei giorni e la presa di confidenza cominciammo ad apprezzare questa nuova amica che spesso arrivava con qualcosa di…commestibile (frutta e verdura perché suo fratello maggiore detto – al Lolè – faceva di mestiere il fruttivendolo ambulante) in omaggio alla nostra famiglia.\nNaturalmente col passar del tempo sapemmo di più da altri, e cioè che la Famiglia Monardi era nota per il suo antifascismo e spesso in conflitto con le autorità locali e per questa ragione Lolè, fratello maggiore di Ida, all’arrivo a Parma di qualche pezzo grosso fascista, veniva preso dalla polizia e accompagnato a San Francesco, in carcere, a scopo…precauzionale, si diceva…..e rilasciato solo alla partenza da Parma del pezzo grosso fascista.\nNon si teneva in nessun conto che egli fosse asmatico e incapace – anche volendo – di atti di violenza.\nSi diceva anche che la famiglia Monardi proveniva dal Borgo dei Minelli ormai demolito per la sua pessima fama e i cui abitanti trasferiti in un nuovo quartiere denominato “I “capanò” – i “capannoni”, tutta gente di umili origini, invisa al fascismo e quindi in costante sorveglianza da parte dei questurini…\nSia come sia, il nostro rapporto con Ida continuava ad essere di autentica amicizia e quello nei nostri confronti fu eccezionale e.tangibile…anche per l’aiuto che ci venne.\nPer esempio, fu lei che trovò un posto di lavoro in un calzaturificio a mia sorella Bruna (così ormai esigeva di essere chiamata mia sorella stessa).\nIda conviveva con la madre e una zia in Borgo Sorgo e con un fratello più giovane – Galliano – e aveva anche una sorella, Marcella , sposata e con figlie.\nLei però era l’anima della famiglia e a lei tutta la famiglia si affidava per qualunque incombenza e lei risolveva ogni grana famigliare. Le sue nipoti in particolare si rivolgevano a lei per ogni cosa.\nIda si sposò tardi, non ebbe figli. Io l’ammirai sempre e la considerai persona eccezionale: un’anima bella preziosa per il prossimo e da ricordare per sempre .\nMeritava di più dalla vita ma anche così resta nel mio cuore un caro e grato ricordo di Lei…. Ciao\nNino",
