    "text": "Major step forward in construction of downtown multi-use stadium All of the structural steel framing for the venue is now in place. KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - City and county officials celebrated a milestone in the construction of the new downtown Knoxville multi-use stadium. All of the more than 1,000 tons of steel framing is now in place. “With the steel structure and framing in place, it’s not so much left to the imagination,” said Eric Vreeland, deputy director of communications for the city. After years of planning, the venue broke ground in June. Now, roughly two-thirds of the concrete has been poured of the stadium’s total. Vreeland said the stadium will be an amenity, but also a major economic tool. “It won’t just be a stadium. We think that this will be a catalyst for other private development in East Knoxville throughout extending the Old City and downtown and then out into Magnolia and the warehouse district. So, we think it will be a major redevelopment tool,” Vreeland said. Vreeland said an independent analysis done by the city found that in 30 years, the project will be a half a billion-dollar investment. “It’ll be interesting to watch in the coming years. We know that property has been purchased from people with the intent they will be building and investing in the area,” Vreeland said. Vreeland said the next step in the construction will be building out rooms, seating and other amenities. Right now, the project is on schedule to begin hosting baseball, soccer and concert events starting in the spring of 2025. Copyright 2023 WVLT. All rights reserved.",

To this end, the ministry has advised pilgrims against storing food for a long time, or eating exposed or non-washed food, or if it looks or smells differently from the normal.\nIn addition, the ministry has urged pilgrims to properly deal with their medications. The faithful are, accordingly, recommended to keep their medications in designated cabins and separate them from those of others. Moreover, the ministry has advised that the doctor on duty during the journey should be keep informed of the health condition of the pilgrim if he/she is ill.\nSaudi authorities have urged pilgrims, who are suffering from chronic diseases, to bring in their medical documents while travelling to the kingdom. The Ministry of Hajj said the procedure is necessary to give them access to medical treatment.\n“If you are suffering from an illness that needs special medical treatment, and use specific medicines and compound medical equipment, don’t forget to bring your medical documents in order to get care and facilitate your journey on arrival and departure,” the ministry said, addressing those pilgrims.\nOverseas pilgrims are also required to get the Neisseria meningitidis vaccine administered prior to their arrival and verified by a certificate from their respective home countries.\nThey must also be vaccinated against polio, COVID-19 and seasonal flu.\nHajj is one of Islam’s five obligatory duties. Muslims, who can physically and financially afford Hajj, have to perform it at least once in a lifetime.",

    "title": "Autonomous AI agents may be available to Singapore firms by 2025 | The Straits Times",
    "text": "SINGAPORE– Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gone up another notch with the development of what are called autonomous AI agents. These virtual assistants can in effect think for themselves and work on their own, putting them well ahead of regular AI agents such as chatbots, which often need a person to tell them what to do at every step. An interaction on the communication tool Slack featuring an imaginary cake shop illustrates their potential. The owner of the shop told a Salesforce digital assistant about a significant challenge: Customers often request personalised birthday cakes, which puts a huge strain on staff trying to keep up with demand. The digital assistant responded by asking about customer behaviours, asking if they also enquired about delivery status, what an acceptable waiting time would be, and if a human should take over such requests when orders exceed 15 cakes. The aim of the exercise is to help design an autonomous AI agent that will eventually take over the handling of customer requests for cake personalisations without troubling bakery staff, who can get on with making the actual cakes. Many agents along these lines made their debut in various software companies in September and are in trial phases, with broader availability expected in early 2025. These new AI agents can make decisions and take action based on what they know and what they are designed to achieve. They essentially break down big projects into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one, getting better as they learn from what works and what doesn’t. They would also coordinate with human staff or specialised agents from inventory, marketing and sales departments to address more complex customer inquiries. What autonomous AI agents do that current gen AI doesn’t The initial excitement surrounding generative AI has waned since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 on realisation of its limitations. Automation platform Workato noted in September, when introducing its new sales and IT automation agents, that existing AI solutions have not met the needs of businesses. “They can’t collaborate with other AI agents to execute processes end to end, can’t integrate with all enterprise applications and data sources, and provide a fragmented user experience across various lines of business,” it said. Mr Wong Wai Meng, who chairs the joint Smart Technologies Action Committee (Stac) under the Singapore Business Federation and SGTech, is optimistic about autonomous AI agents. “You can think of them as a highly efficient workers that operate at incredible speed with limited guidance,” he said. “While Co-pilot is great for tasks like summarising and drafting e-mails, agentic AI offers far more to businesses by enhancing efficiency and productivity.” Three significant developments for businesses Mr Duncan Kenwright, managing director of global solutions at telecommunications firm Verizon, said it is no surprise that companies are experimenting with agents on sales and customer experience, given their potential to deliver customisation to big numbers of customers. “The main advantages of autonomous agents are their ability to offer highly curated products or services to individual customers based on millions of data points instead of making recommendations on broad demographics,” he added. “This approach allows companies, regardless of size, to operate at scale while treating each customer as a unique segment.” Software-as-a-Service providers are also offering AI agents as a way to make the technology cheaper and more accessible. Mr Gavin Barfield, chief technology officer for Salesforce Asean, said companies that have ploughed resources into building their own AI are struggling to keep up. ”What we’re trying to talk to customers about is, don’t DIY (do it yourself) your AI. Many of the large companies in Singapore have really invested in building these massive sort of teams of data scientists,” he added. “That will continue, but you’ve got to build a lot of stuff in order to start delivering from AI. That might not be the best use of your resources. Here, we provide that out-of-the-box ready.” The third significant development is the promise of a new payment model. Customer relationship software firm Zendesk announced in August that it will charge customers only for issues resolved autonomously by its AI agents. Salesforce, which is still finalising its payment terms, has signalled a similar outcome-based payment model. Whether a pay-per-use or subscription model works better would depend on the business involved, said Stac’s Mr Wong. He said: “This approach may encourage businesses to experiment with low usage initially, which keeps costs down. However, this model may not be suitable for all companies as utility-based pricing can complicate forecasting, and many still prefer a more predictable cost structure.” Adoption will be cautious A recent National Prompt Competition organised by the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme) and Straits Interactive attracted more than 100 SMEs, indicating strong interest in AI, said ASME president Ang Yuit. However, unlike the initial rush to adopt generative AI tools such as Microsoft Co-pilot, companies are going to wait and see before signing up for autonomous agents, he said. Mr Ang said: “There are some stuff that AI does very well, and is almost magical, but yet, there are other use cases where the AI can be just plain stupid. So, SME owners who have tried it before also know to take these announcements with a pinch of salt.” Mr Anurag Rana, senior technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, sees potential use cases in customer service, human resources and supply-chain management. The biggest challenge is ensuring the system doesn’t make mistakes or “hallucinate”, he said. While traditional chatbots pass unresolved questions to humans, generative AI autonomous agents might try to solve problems even when the solution isn’t clear. This can lead to costly errors and damage to a company’s reputation. “We foresee at least one to two years of experimentation before this technology is deployed on a full scale,” Mr Rana said. Mr Scott Bickley, research practice lead at Info-Tech Research Group, is likewise cautious about enterprise software firm SAP’s agents launched under its AI named Joule. He noted in CIO magazine: “SAP customers must look under the hood here: What data structure is required? What level of complexity can this engine handle without error? How standardised does your process need to be for this to work?” What next? Costs, accuracy, copyright, explainability, cyber security and inaccuracies caused by hallucinations are most commonly cited as barriers to gen AI adoption. These problems do not go away with AI agents. “While the technology is capable of operating autonomously, ethical considerations remain a key challenge,” said Mr Wong, adding that chief technology officers (CTOs) would need to set up safeguards as reliance on data increases. Technology consultant Bensen Koh urged CTOs to address weaknesses such as poor data quality and partnerships. He believes that a viable working model will emerge over time, as such AI solutions are essential for realising smart cities, autonomous vehicles and advanced digital twins. Mr Shan Moorthy, CTO for Asia-Pacific at human resources and finance platform provider Workday, said the firm’s survey in 2023 showed 51 per cent of Singaporean businesses investing in AI and machine learning, higher than the global average of 34 per cent. “But a lot of people are in that trough of dissolution because they bought into the hype of gen AI but didn’t see the value realisation out of it,” he added. “I think the agentic experience will change that.”",

Yo puedo crear una carta diciendo que soy Bakunin volviendo de la tumba y tendría la misma validez que esto.\nVoy a dar algunas pautas para entender este envío.\n-El primer sionismo era totalmente socialista, incluso comunista. De otra forma no se entiende que Stalin votara a favor de la resolución 181.\n-Sólo la corriente reformista del judaísmo admite rabinas. Las otras corrientes son: laicos, masortíes (se les llama conservadores, aunque en realidad se debería decidir académicos), los ortodoxos y los haredíes con su infinita cantidad de agrupaciones (dinastías).\nEstá mujer ES sionista. Sólo un puñado de frikis haredíes de neturei karta, que además viven en palestina, son antisionistas. Casi el 100% de los judíos son sionistas, de ahí que el antisionismo lo consideren antisemitismo.",

    "text": "Harris slams Trump's Ukraine 'surrender' policy for Ukraine as Zelenskyy visits White House Zelenskyy also met President Joe Biden to present his \"victory plan\", with the White House announcing a fresh military aid package worth nearly US$8 billion for Kyiv as it struggles on the battlefield in the third year of Moscow's invasion. Zelenskyy's visit has been clouded by a blazing row with Republican presidential candidate Trump that underscored how November's US election could upend the support that Ukraine receives from its biggest backer. Harris did not mention Trump by name but said there were \"some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality\". Putin . And let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,\" she said with Zelenskyy by her side. During a separate meeting in the Oval Office with Zelenskyy, Biden pledged that \"Russia will not prevail\" in the war it launched in February 2022. \"Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,\" Biden said after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan. Dressed in his trademark military-style outfit, Zelenskyy replied that \"we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side\". \"WIN THIS WAR\" Zelenskyy is looking to shore up support for his war effort as Biden tries to lock in aid for Ukraine, ahead of the white-knuckle US election on Nov 5. Biden pledged nearly US$8 billion in military aid on Thursday, including US$5.5 billion to be authorized before it expires at the end of the US fiscal year on Monday. Biden said in a statement that the \"surge in security assistance for Ukraine\" would \"help Ukraine win this war\". Biden also announced Washington would provide Ukraine with the Joint Standoff Weapon long-range munition and called a summit of allies in Germany in October. The White House however played down Ukraine's hopes that Zelenskyy's visit would achieve his long-held goal of getting permission to fire long-range Western-made missiles into Russian territory. \"I'm not expecting there to be any new announcements on this particular action or a decision coming out of this meeting,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. Zelenskyy also visited the US Congress - where his government said he had also presented his victory plan - and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. But Zelenskyy's visit has prompted fresh nuclear sabre rattling from Moscow, which has repeatedly warned the West against giving Ukraine long-range arms. \"IRRESPONSIBLE\" NUCLEAR THREATS Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Moscow's rules on the use of its atomic weaponry in the event of a \"massive\" air attack. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the nuclear threat \"totally irresponsible\" while EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano said Putin was making a \"gamble with his nuclear arsenal.\" Kyiv faces an increasingly difficult battlefield situation two and a half years into Russia's invasion, with Russian forces continuing to push into eastern Ukraine. The US presidential election means Washington's support now hangs in the balance. Trump had also been due to meet Zelenskyy during his US visit, but their talks appear to be on ice. At an election rally on Wednesday, the Republican called the Ukrainian president \"probably the greatest salesman on Earth\". Republicans were livid after Zelenskyy visited an arms factory in Biden's hometown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania earlier this week, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the Ukrainian ambassador to be sacked. Trump has echoed many of Putin's talking points about previous US policy being to blame for the Russian invasion and has been critical of Zelenskyy for years.",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "BOSTON — In 2022, the Yankees began the season 61-23 and held a 15 ¹/₂-game lead in the AL East on July 8.\nWhat followed was a 38-40 struggle that climaxed with an Aaron Boone slam of the table , insisting that “it’s right in front of us,” en route to a meek sweep at the Astros’ hands in the ALCS.\nIn 2023, the Yankees were 36-25 on June 4, in the hunt for the division and in comfortable playoff position.\n4 Aaron Judge reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 25, 2024. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post What followed was a 26-43 flatline that began with an Aaron Judge slam of his foot into the base of the wall at Dodger Stadium, a collapse that tanked the Yankees out of relevance .\nIn 2024, the Yankees were 50-22 on June 14, the only annoyance a relentless Orioles club that stayed within reach of first.\nWhat has followed has been a 10-22 run that has revealed far too many holes for a team with World Series hopes during a stretch that might have culminated with yet another Boone table-slam , albeit softer, and another “it’s right in front of us” after getting swept out of the Subway Series on Wednesday.\nExplore More Mike Francesa torches Yankees in epic 26-minute rant after Subway Series sweep: ‘Circus clowns’ Aaron Boone spitting out expletives after Yankees’ latest ugly loss Mets’ Tyrone Taylor batters Gerrit Cole again in big offensive night Is it happening again?\nA season that began with not just aspirations but expectations, after going all-in with the Juan Soto trade, again has been sidetracked by a midseason swoon that is threatening to ruin the year .\nBaltimore’s downturn has kept the O’s within an arm’s reach in the division, but the Yankees hold just a 3 ½-game lead on the final wild card.\n4 Aaron Boone has repeatedly claimed that’s “it’s right in front of us” despite the Yankees’ struggles. Robert Sabo for NY Post They could be another poor series or two — beginning Friday at Fenway Park against a Red Sox club on the rise — from falling out of playoff position altogether.\n“We got the guys in this room that can flip the switch and get us back to where we need to be,” Judge said Wednesday, after a series in which he reached base five times (four walks and a hit by pitch) in nine plate appearances, the Mets seeing little reason to pitch to a superstar with no lineup protection.\nLuis Severino’s good-natured jab was not off-base.\nGo beyond the box score with the Bombers Sign up for Inside the Yankees by Greg Joyce, exclusively on Sports+.\nThank you Enter your email address Please provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\nEnjoy this Post Sports+ exclusive newsletter!\nCheck out more newsletters Perhaps with the exception of Gleyber Torres, who has begun to hit, the Yankees have had two dependable (and overwhelming) hitters and virtually no other threat in their batting order for nearly six weeks.\nSince this nosedive began June 15, hitters Nos. 1 and 4-9 — so, everyone outside of Soto’s and Judge’s 2 and 3 holes — have compiled a .207 average (that entered play Thursday worse than every team’s except the Mariners in the span) and .625 OPS (worse than everyone’s except the White Sox in the stretch).\n“We’re pissed off in there,” Boone said during a tense postgame news conference Wednesday. “We got a lot of pride in there. We got a lot of expectation in there.”\n4 Gerrit Cole reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 24, 2024. JASON SZENES FOR THE NEW YORK POST No one has questioned the team’s desire or work ethic.\nJudge, notably, has begun questioning the team’s confidence.\nAlex Verdugo is in a 5-for-48 rut over his past 13 games .\nBen Rice has not come up with a multi-hit game since his three-homer day on July 6, 4-for-46 in the stretch.\nDJ LeMahieu, a two-time batting champion, has watched his average fall all the way to .179 .\nThere is reason for Yankees hitters to get discouraged, but doing so does not help.\n“You can read body language sometimes, and there’s some certain times where we’re hanging our head a little,” Judge said. “And you just need a little kick in the butt to get it going again.”\n4 The Yankees’ downfall this season has been eerily similar to the past two years. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post Maybe Boone’s emotion, cursing on a couple of occasions and insisting that the club has the ability, was meant as a little kick.\nThe Yankees not long ago were the best team in baseball and did not yet even have their best pitcher.\n“I think we have a lot of talent in the room,” said Gerrit Cole, who owns a 5.40 ERA in seven starts since returning .\n“Just got to see what we did at the beginning of the season,” Soto added. “We have everything that we need to go out there and dominate.”\nTuesday’s trade deadline looms particularly large for a team that would not settle for anything less than a World Series and has holes in the infield, bullpen and perhaps outfield.\nPublicly at least, though, the team is insisting it has the means to fix the issues without Brian Cashman’s immediate help.\n“We hold the pen,” Boone said. “We’re in control of the story.”\nHe hopes it is a story Yankees fans haven’t already read the past two years.",

    "text": "By Doug Spoon, Editor\nHeritage High School water polo player Gracie Ledesma was selected to the All-CIF First Team following the outstanding season of herself and the Patriots.\nDespite missing two games, the talented sophomore accounted for 150 goals on a 74 percent shooting accuracy; 43 assists; 62 steals; and 50 earned ejections. She scored a 90 percent success rate on 5-meter penalty shots.\nLedesma scored all five of the Patriots’ goals in a 10-5 loss to Fullerton High Feb. 12 in the CIF-SS Division 5 quarterfinals. Heritage ended its season with a 17-9 record.\n“Her season was nothing short of inspirational,” said coach Shannon “Lucky” Stephenson. “Gracie’s relentless drive, mental toughness, and unwavering positivity played a crucial role in leading her team to the CIF quarterfinals. Often facing double teams, she never backed down, bringing an unstoppable energy to the game.\n“With a total of 258 goals in just her freshman and sophomore seasons, Gracie has already made a lasting impact. As a coach, watching her play is truly exciting, and Heritage is lucky to have such a talented athlete. Her future in water polo is incredibly bright!”\nIn addition, Sophia De La Torre was selected to the All-CIF Second Team, and Taylor Gruender was selected to the Third Team.",

    "text": "Nibi the 'diva' beaver to stay at rescue center, Massachusetts governor decides Nibi the 'diva' beaver to stay at rescue center, Massachusetts governor decides BOSTON — The question of whether a 2-year-old beaver named Nibi can stay with the rescuers she has known since she was a baby or must be released into the wild was resolved Thursday when the Massachusetts governor stepped in to protect Nibi. The state issued a permit to Newhouse Wildlife Rescue for Nibi to remain at the rehabilitation facility and serve as an educational animal. “Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,” Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said Thursday. “We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species.” Nibi’s fate had made it all the way to the state courts before Healey stepped in. A judge on Tuesday had said that Nibi would be allowed to stay in her home at the rescue center in Chelmsford, located northwest of Boston. A hearing had been set for Friday in a case filed by the rescuers against MassWildlife, the state’s division of fisheries and wildlife, to stop the release. Nibi’s rescuers at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue said on their Facebook page that they were “beyond grateful” for Healey’s decision. Nibi has been a hit on the rescue group’s social media since she was a baby, and posts about her impending release garnered thousands of comments. An online petition to save Nibi from being released into the wild has received over 25,000 signatures, lawmakers have weighed in, and earlier this week Healey pledged to make sure Nibi is protected. “We all care about what is best for the beaver known as Nibi and all wild animals throughout our state,” Mark Tisa, director of MassWildlife, said in a statement Thursday. “We share the public’s passion for wildlife and invite everyone to learn more about beavers and their important place in our environment.” Jane Newhouse, the rescue group’s founder and president, has said that after Nibi was found on the side of the road, they tried to reunite her with nearby beavers who could have been her parents but were unsuccessful. After that, attempts to get her to bond with other beavers also didn’t work. “It’s very difficult to consider releasing her when she only seems to like people and seems to have no interest in being wild or bonding with any of her own species,” she said. Nibi has a large enclosure with a pool at the rescue operation, and will also wander in its yard and rehabilitation space, Newhouse said. “She pretty much has full run of the place. Everybody on my team is in love with her,” she said. Newhouse said she had asked MassWildlife if she could get a permit for Nibi to become an educational beaver, allowing her to take the beaver to schools, libraries and town halls. Newhouse said she feared a release would mean certain death for her beloved “diva” beaver, who doesn’t know how to live in the wild. “It doesn’t give her much time... to figure out how to build a lodge for the first time, how to build dams for the first time, how to store all of her food before winter sets in,” she said. Newhouse said that beavers usually leave their parents between the ages of 2 and 3, so it’s possible that over the next year Nibi will show more interest in wanting to be in the wild. But unless that happens, she wants to keep her safe. Beavers are common and abundant throughout Massachusetts. A keystone species, beavers play an important role in fostering biodiversity of ecosystems, according to state officials. By damming rivers and streams, and forming shallow ponds, beavers are vital for creating healthy wetlands that support a tremendous diversity of plants, bugs, and wildlife, and store floodwaters during storms. They are also North America’s largest native rodents, weighing between 35 and 80 pounds and reaching 2–3 feet in length as adults. Adult beavers have very few predators and can live for 20 years or more. In almost all cases, it’s best to leave wildlife alone, officials said, so they don't come to rely on humans for food and shelter.

    "text": "KEIR Starmer and the Labour government are playing with fire.\nThat’s what I thought as I watched Starmer unveil his latest ‘plan’ for stopping the small boats and fixing Britain’s spiralling border crisis . Standing alongside Emmanuel Macron, President of France, Starmer introduced something that will only further erode public trust and fuel public anger .\nBritain, in case you haven’t noticed, is a tinderbox right now. You can literally feel it. As I said on television last week, thanks to years and years of being lied to and gaslit by politicians in Westminster, the British people are today a lot angrier, a lot more frustrated and a lot more disillusioned than the ruling class think.\nWe got a sense of it in just how quickly some people took to the streets after the Southport atrocity . You can see it, too, in how people are still taking to the streets in Northern Ireland. And you can see it in a surge of public support for Reform and what this represents: a total rejection of the establishment.\nWhich is why I’ve long argued that it is essential the government and the British state get their arms around this border crisis and solve it, quickly, before things get completely out of control.\nBut what has the hapless Sir Keir done? He’s decided to pour yet more gasoline over this tinderbox, making the country even more unstable.\nThe man who spent years deriding Rishi Sunak’s efforts to fix the small boat crisis through the Rwanda plan as a ‘gimmick’ has just delivered to the British people the ultimate gimmick – another trick, another sticking plaster, another reshuffling of the chairs on the deck of the Titanic.\nThis isn’t a serious plan for fixing our borders and restoring public trust. It is an exchange programme for illegal migrants. It is an insult to the British people.\nThe idea is that for every illegal migrant who enters Britain on a small boat and is returned to France, Britain will take a legitimate asylum-seeker from France.\nThis, Starmer and Macron say with straight faces, will smash the business model of the people-smuggling gangs, making it clear if you arrive in Britain illegally you will be sent back to France while only ‘legitimate’ asylum-seekers who have had their cases processed will be allowed to carry on to Britain.\nLet me state what is immediately obvious to anybody who knows anything about border security.\nThis is nonsense.\nFor a start, it makes a total mockery of the social contract in this country.\nLike me, the British people do not want ‘one in, one out’.\nThey want ‘none in, all out’.\nWhat Keir Starmer and his equally hapless Home Secretary Yvette Cooper are trying to push us into is a world in which the large-scale transfer of asylum-seekers and illegal migrants into our country is considered somehow normal and acceptable.\nSorry, but no.\nNo. No. No.\nI do not want to live in that kind of country and nor, I think, do the vast majority of British people.\nBritain has already done its fair share, taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Hong Kong, Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea, to name only a few. Not to mention taking millions of legal migrants, and all while grappling with the worst cost-of-living crisis since the Second World War, the highest tax burden in this country since the late 1940s, and an economy that is as flat as a pancake.\nWhich is why most people in this country want a complete end to mass migration, not the introduction of an exchange scheme for illegal migrants.\nBritain, remember, is already hosting an estimated 1.2million illegal migrants, with one in every 13 people in London thought to be here illegally. I want all those law-breakers out of the country before even considering a new scheme.\nAnd the details behind Labour’s gimmick make zero sense.\nWhile Yvette Cooper stuttered and struggled through media interviews, visibly unable to tell us how many illegal migrants will be sent back to France, some of the numbers that have been released in recent days are truly pathetic.\nAccording to some estimates, this ‘plan’ will be limited to just 50 illegal migrants a week. To put that ‘50 a week’ in context, more than 1,000 illegal migrants arrived in Britain on just one day last month. Nearly 50,000 have arrived since Labour took power.\nOver one year, it would mean returning 2,600 illegal migrants while watching upwards of 50,000 arrive and then, on top of all that, having to take another load of ‘legitimate’ asylum-seekers from France.\nIt’s not just bonkers: it’s outrageous.\nThe underlying logic doesn’t make sense, either. If you are an illegal migrant or people smuggler, the odds are still running firmly in your favour. You try to come to Britain illegally. Maybe you make it, maybe you’re sent back to France. If you are sent back you can apply to become a legitimate asylum-seeker and come again, or you can just take another chance on a boat.\nWhich is why even the French are already saying this will be a disaster, with the head of the northern region of France and the Mayor of Calais both warning that all this will do is create another major ‘pull factor’ for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of migrants to head to France in the hope of moving on to Britain, either illegally or through a new ‘legal’ route.\nOn top of all that, the French are now saying they will pick and choose who they accept back from Britain, making it clear they will refuse anybody who poses a security risk to the French (leaving them, presumably, with us). Why on earth are we allowing the French to have such influence over our own border security?\nThis is the very opposite of what the British people want. They want a migration policy that reflects the interests of the British people, not Emmanuel Macron.\nAnd because nobody in Westminster has the guts to re-establish the supremacy of UK laws – including by leaving the European Convention on Human Rights – what exactly is going to stop one lawyer after another fighting the removal of migrants back to France, claiming that doing so might threaten their ‘rights’ under Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR? Has anybody in government thought this through?\nAll this is merely the latest example of Sell Out Starmer, a man who on everything from Chagos to the India deal, from the EU trade deal to this, has constantly sold the interests and rights of the British people down the river.\nTo top it all off we were also given the truly hideous sight of French President Macron blaming, yes, you guessed it, Brexit for this crisis. This argument, too, though popular in Brussels, Oxford and Cambridge, is idiocy. The small boats crisis began long before Britain left the EU, and Brexit has nothing to do with why a similar invasion has been unfolding across the EU for 15 years.\nEven when Britain was a member of the EU, under the so-called Dublin Convention we hardly sent back any illegal migrants or asylum-seekers while European courts routinely got in the way of these efforts to return migrants.\nAnd what Starmer and Macron are not telling you is that if we were still in the EU we would currently be under enormous pressure to ‘share the burden’ by taking in yet more asylum-seekers through the EU migration and asylum pact.\nThey are, once again, gaslighting you, treating you like morons.\nSo how would you fix it, Matt?\nAs I’ve consistently said , for years, we need to return to being a self-governing, sovereign nation with full control over our borders and laws.\nThat means leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, the ECHR. It means reforming , if not repealing and replacing, Tony Blair’s Human Rights Act, the HRA.\nIt means, once we’ve re-established the supremacy of UK law (which Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan never established), immediately detaining and deporting anybody who arrives illegally to an offshore processing centre, well away from the British people.\nIt means reforming the dodgy immigration tribunals here in Britain and curtailing the rights of activist lawyers to launch one judicial review after another.\nAnd it means pushing forward leaders who actually have what Keir Starmer, Yvette Cooper and pretty much everybody in Westminster currently lack – the courage and guts to stand up to The Blob and overturn the status quo, not just introduce endless gimmicks while fuelling public anger with the entire political system.\nWe can stop this crisis if we really want to. We can secure our borders if we really want to. We can reassert our culture, identity, and way of life if we really want to.\nAnd we can stop this country from taking a turn toward something much darker and angrier if we really want to.\nWhat this will require is pushing forward people who are the very opposite of those who rule over us today – people who will do whatever it takes to fix our borders and ultimately put the British people first. And people who can see, clearly, that if we don’t do this quickly we will soon be forced to grapple with much, much bigger problems in this country.\nThis article appeared in Matt Goodwin on July 12, 2025, and is republished by kind permission.",
