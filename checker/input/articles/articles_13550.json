    "text": "Brittany Cartwright, known for her role on &quot;Vanderpump Rules,&quot; is not one to stay silent in the face of body shaming. The reality TV star recently took to Instagram to share glamorous photos of herself in a black corset-style dress, only to receive comments criticizing her figure. One commenter remarked that Cartwright&apos;s breasts were too big, making her look heavier than she is. However, the celebrity didn&apos;t let the negativity slide. She fired back, stating, &quot;Could you imagine me going on your page and commenting on your body? Yes, my boobs are big, cool.&quot; Despite the trolls, Cartwright received plenty of support, including from her estranged husband, Jax Taylor, who left fire and heart emojis on her post. Taylor has been a strong presence in Cartwright&apos;s life, even contributing to her body transformation journey. Ver esta publicación en Instagram Una publicación compartida por Brittany Cartwright (@brittany) Brittany&apos;s journey to self-esteem Cartwright previously underwent breast augmentation, which was funded by Taylor. The procedure was done with the intention of enhancing her natural curves and boosting her confidence. Additionally, she has undergone treatments such as Kybella injections and liposuction to address areas of concern, such as fat underneath her chin. Beyond her physical appearance, Cartwright has been candid about her personal struggles and triumphs, including her weight loss journey after giving birth to her son, Cruz. Despite their separation, Cartwright has praised Taylor for being a supportive co-parent. #TheValley Brittany Cartwright claps back at troll claiming her &apos;big&apos; chest makes her look &apos;heavier&apos;The &quot;Valley&quot; star didn&apos;t mince words when a follower left a comment on her Instagram post that criticized her figure.https://t.co/weRB8pvSwx pic.twitter.com/R4NEep1I9S?

    "text": "HOUSTON – CP Soccer Houston was founded in 2018, the program is open to players ages 10+, affected by cerebral palsy, stroke, or traumatic brain injury who are ambulatory. “We’re very proud of the relationship we have with HTX Soccer and the great job Coach Keith does for us,” founder Deven Hull said. Besides the obvious notion that kids need sunshine and exercise, the founder of CP Soccer Houston says it’s a great way to level the playing field for children living with cerebral palsy. “This is a medium where they can be with each other, they can create comradery among some kids that have the same afflictions,” Hull said. Despite the club’s notable growth, the HTX Soccer organization still wants more kids to participate. They currently have 25 active players, and they’d like to double that. “We want to have a foundation where we can get kids in the game and keep them in the game,” Hull said. The team is led by 2x Paralympian (Athens and London) Coach Keith Johnson. He’s played soccer since he was 5 years old and has quite the resume. “Basically, I’ll help them with their balance if they fall down, I’ll get them back up, but if they say I can’t do it, I’m like yeah you can do it,“ Johnson said. Johnson proves what someone with CP can do if they apply themselves. He doesn’t often take no for an answer but is continuously impressed by the toughness of his athletes. “The games on Saturdays are getting more competitive and a lot more physical, when they take a knock, they get back up, they never complain about a foul, they just take it in stride and do their best,” Johnson said. No soccer practice is complete without eager parents watching from the sidelines. Matt Fuller’s daughter Riley started competing five years ago. “It’s been great I think especially for her socially being around other kids that are also CP has been wonderful for her, she’s made some friends out of it. It’s hard to find other kids that are dealing with the same stuff, so it’s good for them to be together,” Fuller said. Riley was having a great time on the pitch. You could hear her yelling excitedly in the video above. “It’s been good just from a physical standpoint, her balance and her coordination, she didn’t really understand the game of soccer honestly 5 years ago. So just being able to learn the game, we’ve taken her to a Dynamo game now, so just general knowledge of the game has been wonderful, she loves it,” said Fuller.

    "text": "Hamas commander who was also UN aid worker dead: Israel Israel’s military said on Oct 24 it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel and who also worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. The agency, UNRWA, has been accused by Israel of having many employees who double as members of Hamas and other armed groups. The UN said in August that nine UNRWA staff were possibly involved in the Oct 7 attacks and fired them. There was no immediate comment from UNRWA regarding the latest Israeli allegation. Separately, the agency on Oct 23 had said that one of its staff members was killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza Strip. North Korean units already in Kursk region, says Ukraine Ukraine’s military intelligence service said on Oct 24 that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces staged a major incursion in August. The Kremlin has previously dismissed reports about the North’s troop deployment as “fake news”. But Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Oct 24 that it was Moscow’s business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang. The Russian leader did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia. McDonald’s sued by US man sickened in E. coli outbreak A Colorado man has filed what appears to be the first lawsuit against McDonald’s over an E. coli outbreak linked to Quarter Pounder burgers that has killed one person and sickened nearly 50 others. The lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois, on Oct 23, alleges that Mr Eric Stelly ate food from a Greeley, Colorado, McDonald’s on Oct 4 and tested positive for E. coli a few days later. Colorado health officials later told Mr Stelly that his E. coli was connected to the McDonald’s outbreak, the lawsuit said. King Charles’ Scotland retreat could become wedding venue Britain’s King Charles III’s remote private estate in the Scottish Highlands could become an exclusive location for weddings, if an application to the local council is approved. Documents submitted for consideration next week by the licensing board of Aberdeenshire Council outline plans to allow “weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events” at the Queen’s Building on the royal Balmoral Estate. The Queen’s Building lies just north of Balmoral Castle near the estate office and stables, and was built in the 1980s as staff quarters and a canteen. Chris Hoy resolved to find positives in cancer diagnosis Six-time Olympic cycling champion Chris Hoy said he is hoping to make a positive impact from his terminal cancer diagnosis after it sparked a surge in men seeking advice. Britain’s most successful Olympian, 48, revealed his prognosis at the weekend, after announcing in February that he had been diagnosed with cancer. Hoy explained he had initially shrugged off pain in his shoulder as an injury caused by exertions in the gym.",

    "text": "El preso político cubano Pedro Albert Sánchez afirmó en una llamada telefónica desde la prisión habanera 1580 que está en huelga de hambre desde el domingo.\n“Tras 39 días mal alimentándome del saco [provisiones llevadas por su familia] y tres días con fiebre y dolor de cabeza por el estado gripal que cubre aquí a casi todos los reclusos y a muchos guardias también, decidí plantarme, una vez más, y el último alimento lo comí el domingo 20 al anochecer”, dijo Albert Sánchez a su esposa, Ana Elvis Amaya Leyva, que envió la grabación de la conversación a Martí Noticias.\nDesde su encarcelamiento, Albert Sánchez, de 68 años, ha realizado varias huelgas de hambre y acciones de protesta. “Pudiera parecer un para adelante y para atrás, pero no es así. Es mi única actitud ante el momento histórico del país, las circunstancias violentas que se han presentado en los últimos días y que se repetirán progresivamente”.\nEl profesor y activista padece cáncer de próstata. Su familia espera respuesta a una petición de licencia extrapenal por su condición de salud, que fue entregada el 6 de mayo pasado.\nParticipante de las protestas del 11 de julio de 2021 en Guanabacoa, La Habana, un tribunal lo condenó a cinco años de libertad limitada por los cargos de “desórdenes públicos” y “desacato”.\nFue internado en la cárcel en noviembre de 2023, luego de que el Tribunal de Ejecución de La Habana revocara su sanción y lo condenara a cumplir en un centro penitenciario cerrado.\nEn julio de este año, Amnistía Internacional declaró \"preso de conciencia\" al profesor jubilado y envió una carta al gobernante Miguel Díaz-Canel en la que lo instó a que \"lo ponga en libertad de forma inmediata e incondicional\".",
