    "text": "NFL player props: 5 best bets for Wild Card Weekend After fighting all season to get to the playoffs, weather could be the most dominant factor in 2 of the games and will have an impact on a couple of this week's Wild Card Weekend. Below, we analyze [BetMGM Sportsbook's](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752) NFL odds and lines, and tab the best NFL Wild Card Weekend player prop bets to cash in on among SportbookWire's [NFL expert picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/). For this week's picks, we have a running back going Over his projection in the freezing conditionals in Kansas City, a QB rushing for a TD in the snow in Buffalo, 2 running backs not hitting their numbers in climate-controlled conditions and one of the most dynamic wide receivers dominating his matchup. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: [Get ESPN+](https://go.web.plus.espn.com/GjNV9m) NFL Wild Card Weekend prop bet picks and predictions Odds provided by [BetMGM Sportsbook](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752); access [USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores) for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.

    "title": "Bel-Sar Elicits Complete Responses in NMIBC",
    "text": "News Article Belzupacap sarotalocan produced complete responses in patients with low-grade non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A single, low dose of belzupacap sarotalocan (bel-sar; AU-011) generated complete responses (CRs) in patients with low-grade non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), according to interim results from a phase 1 trial (NCT05483868) announced by Aura Biosciences.1 Findings showed that among 5 patients with low-grade NMIBC treated with bel-sar without light activation in part 1 of the study, 4 achieved a clinical CR with no tumor cells detected in a post-treatment histopathological evaluation in the target and several non-target tumors. Across the 2 parts of the study, 13 patients with NMIBC have been treated with bel-sar, including 8 additional patients who received bel-sar with light activation in part 2 of the study. Notably, 5 patients enrolled in part 2 had low-grade NMIBC, and 3 had high-grade disease. Following a single dose of bel-sar, clinical activity was observed in the form of tumor shrinkage, immune activation, and histopathological evidence of cancer cell absence or necrosis. “We are highly encouraged by this positive early data, which shows that bel-sar has the potential to be a transformative cancer treatment,” Sabine Brookman-May, MD, FEBU, senior vice president and therapeutic area head of Urologic Oncology at Aura Biosciences, stated in a news release. “A potentially differentiating aspect of this novel treatment is the rapid tumor response accompanied by an immuno-oncology [IO] effect such as a marked CD8+ T-cell infiltration observed in just a matter of days with a single low dose. We believe this could have the potential to translate into a durable response. In parallel with expanding the ongoing phase 1 trial, we are preparing for a phase 2 trial to further evaluate bel-sar’s clinical activity and durability of response.” Bel-sar is a virus-like drug conjugate. The agent features a dual mechanism of action intended to induce direct tumor cell necrosis and generate a robust and durable antitumor immune response. The ongoing phase 1 study is enrolling patients at least 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.2 Patients need to have recurrence of prior NMIBC confirmed by biopsy or pathology within 12 months of enrollment, or newly diagnosed NMIBC via biopsy within 6 months of screening. Patients with MIBC are allowed to enroll if the malignancy is confirmed pathologically. Other key inclusion criteria consist of no evidence of metastatic disease, and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Patients are being excluded if they received an investigational drug or medical device within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the first visit; are concurrently enrolled in another investigational trial; have active bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; or have chronic, active hepatitis B/C or HIV. In part 1 of the study, which has been completed, patients with low-grade NMIBC received a single dose of bel-sar without light activation.1 In part 2, patients are receiving bel-sar with light activation, and this part of the trial is investigating 2 injection methods and 2 dose levels of bel-sar (100 µg and 200 µg). Across both parts, bel-sar is being administered 7 to 12 days prior to standard-of-care transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). The incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and serious adverse effects (AEs) is serving as the trial’s primary end point.2 Among the 8 patients treated thus far in part 2, 7 had a history of recurrent NMIBC and underwent multiple TURBTs and adjuvant therapies, including BCG, mitomycin, gemcitabine, cetrelimab, and tamoxifen before enrollment.1 Regarding safety, bel-sar was well-tolerated; grade 1 treatment-emergent AEs related to the agent occurred in less than 10% of patients, and no patients had grade 2 or higher AEs related to bel-sar. No patients experienced serious AEs. Notably, safety data were consistent irrespective of the use of light activation. “Bel-sar has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for NMIBC. Based on this early data, bel-sar’s positive clinical activity and evidence of a bladder urothelial field effect with a single dose, may position bel-sar to be the first immune ablative treatment option for early-stage bladder cancer patients delivered with an in-office procedure,” Neal Shore, MD, FACS, United States chief medical officer of Surgery and Oncology at GenesisCare, added in the news release.",

    "text": "State Supreme Court rules against challenges to UC student housing project at People’s Park\nThe state’s highest court dismissed suits filed to stop the university’s plans for People’s Park on environmental grounds.\nBerkeleyside reported that Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, along with the rest of the judges, ruled that the concerns that construction at the site would generate excessive noise had no merit.\nThe ruling officially ends three years of legal challenges to the 16-story student housing project, which will see the provide 1,100 student beds.The Berkeley City Council and many Southside community groups have supported the student housing project. Student housing has been at a premium in Berkeley for several years.\nAccording to the U-C’s Board of Regents, Cal currently provides only about 20 percent of student housing, by far the least of any school in the UC system.\nHowever,\nopponents of the project have long pointed out the rich cultural history of Peoples Park, which stretches back to its founding by community members in 1969, during the heyday of the Free Speech Movement. The park was listed two years ago on the The National Register of Historic Places,in recognition of its historical and cultural significance. In January, the university sent in hundreds of police to evict homeless residents and close off the park, erecting razor wire and double-stacked container barricades. The move stirred new protests by those seeking to maintain People’s Park. The university has spent more than $10 million on security at the site.",
