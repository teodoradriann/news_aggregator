    "text": "Through this rose dedication, DHMC recognizes our dedication and commitment to the life-saving and healing generosity of organ and tissue donation. We are grateful to be part of this celebration of life to be viewed by millions on New Year’s Day.Joanne M. Conroy, MD Dartmouth Health’s Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) has partnered with [New England Donor Services](https://neds.org/) to honor and remember those who gave the gift of life through organ and tissue donation. On January 1, 2024, the [Donate Life Rose Parade Float](https://donatelifefloat.org/si/), titled “Woven Together: The Dance of Life,” will include a dedication garden made up of roses with handwritten dedications by transplant hospital CEOs across the country including Joanne M. Conroy, MD, CEO and president of Dartmouth Health. “Through this rose dedication, DHMC recognizes our dedication and commitment to the life-saving and healing generosity of organ and tissue donation,” Conroy said. “We are grateful to be part of this celebration of life to be viewed by millions on New Year’s Day.” Since its debut on New Year’s Day 2004, the Donate Life Rose Parade Float has become the world’s most visible campaign to inspire people to become organ and tissue donors. In addition to the 40 million viewers who watch the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/about/about-rose-parade/) on TV and along the parade route, events are held around the country to complete the “floragraph” images of donors that adorn the float. The “Woven Together: The Dance of Life” float showcases the culture of the Hopi, native to the American Southwest. This group of Pueblo Native Americans is one of the oldest cultures in the United States, originating approximately 7,000 years ago. The Hopi have always been outstanding weavers and artisans, and their dances include colorful costumes and impressive headdresses and will be reflected in the float’s design. As the world’s most visible campaign to inspire organ, eye and tissue donation, the Donate Life Rose Parade float inspires viewers to save and heal more than one million people in need of organ and tissue transplants each year. “I am proud of DHMC’s commitment to organ and tissue donation,” said Michael F. Daily, MD, MS, FACS, section chief of transplant surgery at DHMC. “The ability to help our patients is made possible through this generous gift of life.” Register today to become an organ and tissue donor by visiting [RegisterMe.org](https://registerme.org/).

Researchers observed the association for hormone receptor-positive disease. Women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer appeared more likely than those with earlier-stage breast cancer to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease, according to results of a retrospective study.\nThe association persisted among women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer , as well as for those with hormone receptor-positive disease.\n“Cardiovascular optimization is going to potentially impact cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes,” Kevin T. Nead, MD, MPhil, assistant professor of epidemiology and radiation oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, told Healio.\nBackground and methods Cardiovascular disease and cancer cause the most deaths in the U.S.\n“For a long time, we attributed that to shared risk factors,” Nead said. “If you don’t live a healthy lifestyle, some of those risk factors like smoking contribute to cardiovascular disease and cancer. In the last 5 years or so, there’s been more data coming out — mostly in mouse studies — showing a direct link between cardiovascular disease and cancer. In particular, they are showing that cardiovascular events like heart attacks essentially suppress the immune system. In mice, the immune system doesn’t do its job to stop cancers before they develop or help prevent them from spreading or progressing. You get more cancer, cancers that are faster growing and cancers that are more likely to spread in mice.”\nNead and colleagues used SEER-Medicare linked databases to evaluate the association between cardiovascular disease and cancer among 19,292 women (median age, 73 years; 86.5% white). All women had screening mammograms within 2 years of breast cancer diagnosis.\nResearchers established two matched cohorts with 9,646 people in each. The first cohort consisted of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and the other included women diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease.\nPrevalence of cardiovascular disease at time of breast cancer diagnosis served as the primary endpoint.\nResults About half (49.1%) of the individuals in the matched cohorts had cardiovascular disease. Of those, 91.5% of cases had been found in the 2 years before breast cancer diagnosis.\nWomen diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer had higher odds of pre-existing cardiovascular disease than those diagnosed with early-stage disease (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17).\nWomen diagnosed with locally advanced disease also had a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease than those with early-stage disease (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17).\n“Ten percent is not a huge absolute change but, in cancer and cardiovascular disease, we’re talking about potentially a lot of people,” Nead said.\nResearchers observed the association for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19) but not for hormone receptor-negative disease.\nApproximately 70% of all breast cancer cases are hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative, according to an MD Anderson Cancer Center press release. The 5-year survival rate for metastatic hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative disease is 34%.\n“Where the effect seemed to come from in our study is the hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative subtype, which is typically the slowest growing breast cancer subtype,” Nead said. “I think that makes sense. I don’t think that the contribution of cardiovascular disease is so strong that if somebody develops a very aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer that there’s going to be a lot of space for cardiovascular disease to have an impact.\n“But hormone receptor-positive/HER2 negative cancer [tends] to be slow growing. They might not get detected for quite a while,” he added. “They might stay small for a long time. It gives a larger window where that cancer might have developed prior to being formally diagnosed, where somebody could have a cardiovascular event or some other kind of cardiovascular health outcome that might have the chance to drive that immunosuppressive state and impact that breast cancer.”\nResearchers acknowledged study limitations, including its observational nature and the inability to determine causality.\n‘Reinforce’ the findings Prospective studies are needed to further investigate this potential link, Need said, though he emphasized they would be difficult to conduct.\n“The exposure is a cardiovascular event or severe cardiovascular disease. You can’t really randomize people to that,” Nead said. “The best study design you’re going to come up with is more of a prospective population that was probably run for some other reason. Researchers would identify the individuals who had an event and those who didn't, and then look forward in time to see if there's a difference in cancer incidence and severity at the time of diagnosis.”\nNead and colleagues also are testing the hypothesis on prostate cancer , another slow-developing malignancy.\n“If we see this effect in low-risk prostate cancers but we don’t see it in a more aggressive type of cancer like pancreatic cancer, that would help reinforce this hypothesis,” Nead said.\n“Cancer prevention and early detection is really where we can make the biggest positive impact on patients,” he added. “If we can prevent people from getting cancer, if we can detect them early while they’re curable, patients are in a much better position than having an advanced cancer with a fancy new medication.”\nReferences: Angelov I, et al.

    "title": "Mayorkas Spews Outright Lies About Possible “Migrant” Terror Attack, Says Congress Must “Fix” Border",
    "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was in full fib mode yesterday on Morning Joe, an arm of the Biden administration’s Mainstream Media Information Ministry.\nWith more than\n300 terror suspects caught at the border this fiscal year, along with the Biden “migrant” terrorists whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has caught, Mayorkas told viewers that the “migrant” terror threat is much ado about nothing.\nAnd if anyone is to blame for the “migrant” invasion Biden invited and has illegally aided and abetted, it’s Congress. It needs to “fix” the problem.\nBoth claims are palpably false. And Mayorkas knows it.\nWhat He Said\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski — daughter of\nDeep State apparatchik Zbigniew — asked Mayorkas about the possibility that terrorists might enter the country. And, she wanted to know, why is the administration releasing “migrants” before asylum claims are adjudicated?\n“There two issues here I want to ask you about,” she began:\nThe first is NBC News reporting that the Department of Homeland Security has identified over 400 immigrants who have come to the U.S. from Central Asia and elsewhere as subjects of concern, and some even affiliated, potentially, with an ISIS-affiliated human-smuggling network. That’s number one. And then number two, reporting from NBC News that the administration is still releasing illegal crossers inside the U.S. to live while they pursue asylum claims; that it’s not officially really working and it’s still — there are still a lot of folks coming through here the way they shouldn’t.\nMayorkas, whom the\nU.S. House of Representatives impeached for breaking U.S. immigration laws and creating policies not authorized by Congress, was ready. Not to worry, he said. We have everything under control. And by the way, the invasion that Biden invited isn’t his fault. Blame Congress.\n“Well, if I may correct you in a number of regards, number one, with respect to the people from Central Asia, we have no evidence that they are individuals plotting to harm the United States,” Mayorkas said. He apparently forgot that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n“That is inaccurate,” the\nunindicted visa fraudster continued:\nIt’s very important to note that the safety and security of the American people [is] our highest priority. We screen and vet individuals at the time of encounter. If we learn of derogatory information, we take enforcement action. We are proceeding with extreme caution here in the service of the security and safety of the American people.\nThen Mayorkas blamed “detention capacity” for Biden’s releasing millions of unvetted “migrants” to roam free,\nraping and murdering Americans.\n“Fundamentally, we’re operating within a broken immigration system,” he claimed. “We need Congress to fix it. Everyone agrees with that. It hasn’t been fixed since 1996.”\nThe Truth\nIn fact, the administration does have evidence that individuals from Central Asia are plotting terror attacks.\nICE and the FBI recently arrested eight would-be bombers from Central Asia’s Tajikistan who entered at the southern border and were supposedly “fully vetted,” Fox News’ Bill Melugin reported.\n“I’m told all 8 crossed the southern border illegally, received ‘full vetting,’ and had no initial derogatory information that flagged,” he wrote on X:\nI’m told derogatory info/potential national security concerns flagged later on — apparently after release into the US. Source was unable to say when and where they crossed illegally into the US.\nIn January,\nICE agents collared a Somali al-Shabaab terrorist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Border agents caught him last year in March and released him. Only after that release did the Terrorist Screening Center confirm that he was, indeed, a member of the deadly terrorist outfit.\nOn May 3, a Jordanian illegal alien and another unknown individual\ntried to enter Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia in a box truck. They pretended to be delivering for Amazon. On March 27, a Chinese national tried to enter the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twenty-Nine Palms, California.\nThose arrests, and\nBiden’s permitting thousands of Chinese and other nationals from hostile nations to enter the country, explain why 10 former FBI officials wrote a letter to top elected officials on Capitol Hill to warn about a terror attack.\n“It would be difficult to overstate the danger represented by the presence inside our borders of what is comparatively a multi-division army of young single adult males from hostile nations and regions whose background, intent, or allegiance is completely unknown,” the officials wrote.\nAs well,\nthey wrote:\nA startling number had been found on the terror watch list or are from countries designated as state sponsors of terror or distinctly unfriendly to the United States. …\nThese men are potential operators in what appears to be an accelerated and strategic penetration, a soft invasion, designed to gain internal access to a country that cannot be invaded militarily in order to inflict catastrophic damage if and when enemies deem it necessary.\nThat warning apparently had no effect on the Democratic legislators who received it. Biden and Mayorkas obviously ignored it.\nNo, Congress Needn’t “Fix” It\nThe second fib was that Congress must “fix” the border problem. No one, including Mayorkas, believes that Democrat talking point.\nThe “migrant” invasion at the border began pursuant to illegal executive orders from Biden and Mayorkas that formed the basis of the impeachment case against Mayorkas.\nThe articles detail Mayorkas’ “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,” a charge that applies to Biden as well. The articles charged Mayorkas with “a catch and release scheme, whereby such aliens are unlawfully released, even without effective mechanisms to ensure appearances before the immigration courts for removal proceedings or to ensure removal in the case of aliens ordered removed.”\nAnd with this “\nGuidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law,” released on September 30, 2021, Mayorkas simply rewrote the nation’s immigration laws. He stopped the deportation of deportable illegals, including dangerous illegal-alien criminals. A criminal conviction, he wrote, is no reason to deport an illegal alien.\nBiden and Mayorkas have\nignored black-letter law in the Secure Fence Act and Immigration and Nationality Act, by releasing and not detaining and not deporting deportable illegals. And they have committed federal felonies by bringing in and harboring illegal aliens.\nThat aside, Biden undertook all the policies that invited the invasion, not least his illegal program to “parole” illegals — another item in Mayorkas’ impeachment — without congressional authorization.\nThus, Congress needn’t fix anything.\n“For months, the President and his White House have claimed they need a new law to take any action on the border,” GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X during negotiations over border-security legislation:\nThat was patently false. …\nThe President has ample authority to take a range of actions to stem the flow of illegal immigration. He has a moral and legal responsibility to do all he can to try to reverse the catastrophe he has created.\nH/T:\nBreitbart",

    "text": "Modern Trail of Tears: The Commodification of First Foods and Medicines in Relation to Food Apartheid and Genocide of Indigenous Peoples\nFirst Advisor\nJudy Bluehorse Skelton\nDate of Award\nSpring 6-16-2024\nDocument Type\nThesis\nLanguage\nEnglish\nSubjects\nFood Apartheid, Genocide, Indigenous Nations, Native American Studies, Origin Stories, First Foods and Medicines\nAbstract\nI am asking you to share in a cultural conversation with me. I will use different fonts in order to express my autobiographical and ethnographic Indigenous story separate from traditional academic writing This will not be a traditional thesis by any means of academic writing; this will also be a living document in a format of a cited reflection in order to continue the conversation not only through my Indigenous Research but also through community, and ideally will create everlasting solutions. However, this will be an introduction into my Indigenous writing and Indigenous voice.\nI will be discussing the next steps of my ethnographic, autobiographical thesis which is a method that I have been focusing on over the last several years that was introduced to me by Indigenous scholars Rachel Black Elk (Lakota, Lumbee) and Renea Perry (Tlingit/Inupiat/N. European) of Portland State University. I recognized the importance of this style as I found my voice in academic writing, after the month that I spent traveling in Kenya in July 2023. I am working in the ideology of a scholarly cited reflection1 and have been reading Indigenous scholarship in this format as well to draw further inspiration and direction. I will also introduce additional Indigenous Scholarship that I will be studying as I continue to write my thesis in order to deconstruct, decolonize and Re-Indigenize myself as well as my writing and this process. This thesis is an open invitation to the public beyond academia and will be presented as such to the communities as a living document.\nComments\nI am Afro-Indigenous undergraduate with a major of a Honors BA in Indigenous Nations and Native American Studies with a ITECK certificate. This is not included in the degree options drop down.\nRecommended Citation\nJones, Darius R., \"Modern Trail of Tears: The Commodification of First Foods and Medicines in Relation to Food Apartheid and Genocide of Indigenous Peoples\" (2024).

    "text": "Pat Cummins' 10 wickets lead Australia to 79-run win over Pakistan in Melbourne Melbourne/IBNS: Australia captain Pat Cummins picked 10 wickets in the second Test against Pakistan, powering the hosts to clinch a 79-run victory at MCG in Melbourne and decide the fate of the series with a match to spare. Chasing a target of 317, Pakistan were bowled out by the Aussies for 237. After Mohammad Rizwan (35 off 62 balls) was sent back by Cummins, Pakistan collapsed in quick time to bite the dust in the Boxing Day Test. Cummins, who picked five wickets for 49 in the second innings, had scalped as many wickets conceding 48 runs when Pakistan batted for the first time in the match. Photo courtesy: X/@ICC The Australia captain helped his team take a comfortable lead over Pakistan, who were dismissed for 262 in reply to the hosts' 318 in the first innings. Though Pakistan were ripping apart Australia's batting order in the second innings reducing them to 16/4 at one stage, Mitchell Marsh (96), Alex Carey (53) and Steven Smith (50) did the rescue job and took the team to 262. Bagging the series 2-0 already, Australia would look to strategise for the ultimate match in Sydney where David Warner will be given a farewell.

    "text": "U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Acting State Director for Michigan Valarie Handy today announced $1,440,321 in grants to improve distance learning and telemedicine in the Thumb area and central Michigan.\n“These investments illustrate how USDA Rural Development’s programs provide a critical impact on Michigan communities,” Handy said. “The ability to receive medical treatment in your own community, without having to drive dozens of miles over snow-covered rural roads, can make a life-saving difference.”\nThe funds are available through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grant program.\nCaro Community Schools, in Tuscola County, will use a $848,462 grant to equip two hub sites and six end-user sites throughout Clare, Isabella, Tuscola and St. Clair counties with distance learning equipment. Instructors at Caro Community Schools will deliver business industry tours, virtual field trips, dual enrollment and entrepreneurship workshops to five locations benefiting 1,479 students.\nMcKenzie Memorial Hospital, in Sanilac County, will use a $591,859 grant to equip 11 hub sites and 12 end-user sites throughout Sanilac County with telemedicine equipment for patient care and video conferencing equipment for clinician education and training. Medical professionals at the hospital and its affiliated health clinics will deliver services including cardiology, orthopedics, general surgery, gastrointestinal care, pulmonology, behavioral health, wound care, nutrition, critical care and primary medical services across the 12 end-user locations benefiting 2,724 rural residents. The project network includes the main hospital, ten community clinics providing specialized care, and the Sanilac County Jail.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.
