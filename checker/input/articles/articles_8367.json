    "title": "Chinese Residents Sincerely Wish Master Li a Happy New Year | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Falun Dafa has for the past 31 years not only guided practitioners with the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance, but also inspired everyday citizens in China to be good people, which has brought them blessings such as health, safety, and much more. They sent their greetings to the Minghui.org website, to thank Master Li, the founder of Falun Dafa, and wish him a Happy New Year! Learning to Be Tolerant Lan, who lives in the Tongzhou District in Beijing, described something she experienced on December 2, 2023. “At 4 p.m. that day, a woman with an accent [not from Beijing] called me out at work saying that my bag damaged her strawberries. I went outside and saw my bag which was in my bike basket was neatly placed on a plate of strawberries,” she wrote in her letter. “I knew this woman was an accident faker (someone who stages accidents to extort money). I then remembered in a DVD called Coming for You, that a Falun Dafa practitioner who bought a thermos returned 10 yuan to the cashier who mistakenly undercharged him. So I decided to be a good person like that practitioner and bought the strawberries from this accident faker.” When she headed home that day, Lan felt peaceful with an open mind, and she also recited, “Falun Dafa is good” and “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good,” as recommended by the DVD. “After I came home, I suddenly realized that the running nose that had bothered me for a week had stopped. Not only that, the ‘damaged’ strawberries were not bruised. Falun Dafa is truly extraordinary!” she continued. “I know that these were blessings because of my kind thoughts. Thank you Master Li, and I wish you a Happy New Year!” Retired Village CCP Secretary Sees Hope in Falun Dafa Wei was the village’s Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Secretary for 28 years in Yantai City, Shandong Province. In the beginning, he had a simple thought of doing things for people without fighting for his own personal gains. Local residents all supported him and he was reelected again and again. “But later on I found I could not continue any longer. The CCP became so rotten that one always had to lie in order to please higher officials; otherwise, you were not a good official. In addition, one has to pay bribes here and there; otherwise, you cannot get anywhere with the village projects. I was frustrated, but I could not figure out why,” he wrote in his letter. After reading [truth clarification] materials distributed by Falun Dafa practitioners, Wei gradually understood what was happening in China. “The society is experiencing a moral decay, and it’s really alarming if things continue like this,” Wei wrote. “Master Li introduced Falun Dafa and the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance to save us, but the CCP is undermining mankind by suppressing traditional values, including Falun Dafa’s teachings. That is why I admire Master Li and I fully support Falun Dafa practitioners! I also want to quit all the CCP organizations I am affiliated with, because I want to be a good person.” Village Official Criticizes the CCP Liang from Jingzhou County, Hunan Province, raised pigs, and he was elected a village official. In the countryside, there is a tradition of raising pigs. “But under the totalitarian rule of the CCP, all pigsties were removed for so-called ‘environmental protection’ and we were not allowed to burn the stalks after we harvested the crops—not even the weeds. The high environmental pollution fines made it difficult for many small and medium-sized businesses,” Liang wrote. “Because of the political propaganda of ‘building a modern countryside’, we are not allowed to build houses even on our own homesteads. Due to high fines, projects are left unfinished for years, and can be seen everywhere. People’s resentment against the CCP’s tyranny has boiled over.” As a village official, Liang was well aware that the CCP’s control and brutality against Falun Dafa was even more reckless. The CCP’s persecution and “zero-out” campaigns are irrational, while the peaceful efforts of Falun Dafa practitioners have won more and more support. “When reading Master Li’s new articles, ‘How Humankind Came To Be’ and ‘Why Save Sentient Beings’, I could feel his immense compassion of reviving traditional values and upholding morality. This will lead us to a better future. Thank you Master Li!” Blessings of Being Good People One resident of Changping District in Beijing said he knew that Falun Dafa practitioners were good people, and completely different from what the television media depicts. “I also listened to Master Li’s audio lectures, and everything in them is encouraging us to be good and better people,” the man wrote. “I have followed these principles at work and in my life. Thank you Master Li, and Happy New Year!” Gang, a resident in Zhaoyuan City, Shandong Province, said he was tired of seeing how corrupt the CCP officials are, but they continue mistreating innocent Falun Dafa practitioners. “No one in our village says anything good about the Party. When village officials asked me to join the Party recently, I said no way! The CCP will meet its end for harming people and I don’t want to die with it,” he wrote in his greetings. “Falun Dafa and Master Li will save us. Thank you Master Li!” One resident in Jianping County, Liaoning Province, said some of his family members practice Falun Dafa, and he was encouraged to be a good person. “Many coworkers pick the easy tasks at work, but I will do whatever is needed to get the job done. I am not calculating my gains or losses, and often help out others. Because of that, I have a peaceful mind and good health. I am the only worker who was not infected during the pandemic. I sincerely thank Master Li for restoring traditional values, and hope he returns to China,” he wrote in his greetings. Ning, who lives in Qitaihe City, Heilongjiang Province, is not a Falun Dafa practitioner. She wrote, “But I have seen how my child’s mother-in-law has miraculously survived a fatal illness because of Falun Dafa. I think I will practice later.” One practitioner in Baoding City, Hebei Province, said that when he told villagers about Falun Dafa, they were very supportive. “Some of them said they were not articulate, but asked me to pass on their sincere ts to Master Li and wish him a Happy New Year!” he wrote in the greetings. The family members of a practitioner in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, said that they are grateful to Falun Dafa and Master Li. “In this society of uncertainty, Falun Dafa gives us assurance, hope, and blessings. Thank you Master Li!” A resident in Yantai City, Shandong Province said that she felt fortunate that her family members are able to practice Falun Dafa. She is very thankful and wishes Master Li a Happy New Year! Three residents from Jianping County in Liaoning Province said they witnessed how Falun Dafa helped their family members become better people. “We always support Falun Dafa, and will forever stand with Dafa practitioners as well as Master Li. Words can’t describe how we cherish the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. Thank you Master Li!” they wrote in their greetings. A greeting from Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, wrote: “Dear Master Li, Happy New Year! Here we want to say Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is truly wonderful. We everyday people will forever remember how great you are by introducing Falun Dafa to this world. From residents in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province” Additional greetings were received from:Baicheng City, Jilin ProvinceLiuyang City, Hunan ProvinceWuhan City, Hubei ProvinceChangping District, BeijingDalian City, Liaoning ProvinceSantai County, Sichuan Province Jianping County, Liaoning Province Copyright © 1999-2023 Minghui.org.

Junto dele está sendo construído o Extremely Large Telescope, com capacidade ainda maior.\n\"As emissões de poeira durante a construção, o aumento da turbulência atmosférica e, especialmente, a poluição luminosa, terão um impacto irreparável nas capacidades de observação astronômica\", advertiu o diretor-geral do ESO, Xavier Barcons, em comunicado.\nParanal foi inaugurado em 1999 e fica em pleno deserto de Atacama, o mais árido do mundo e lugar ideal para a observação astronômica por seu clima seco, grande altitude e ausência de nuvens e chuva.\nO complexo é parte da rede de observatórios astronômicos que estão situados no Chile, entre eles o radiotelescópio Alma e o telescópio ótico de La Silla.\nNo fim de dezembro, a companhia AES Andes informou que o projeto inclui \"a produção de hidrogênio e amoníaco verde, bem como o desenvolvimento de energia solar, eólica e de armazenamento em baterias\", em linha com o objetivo do Chile de ampliar a origem renovável de sua matriz energética.\nA AES Andes foi procurada pela AFP, mas não fez comentários.\nPara Itziar de Gregorio, representante do ESO no Chile, \"é crucial considerar localidades alternativas para este megaprojeto que não coloquem em perigo um dos tesouros astronômicos mais importantes do mundo\".\nEm outubro de 2024, entrou em vigor no Chile uma nova regra de luminosidade para proteger lugares próximos aos observatórios, mas também a saúde de pessoas e animais.\nA normativa estabelece limites de luminosidade, horários máximos de funcionamento de telões publicitários, além de promover a transição para o uso de luz quente, que produz menos luminosidade.",

    "text": "O presidente do Uruguai, Luis Lacalle Pou, considerou que a decisão da mais alta corte da Venezuela, que validou nesta quinta-feira (22) a reeleição do presidente Nicolás Maduro, apenas confirma uma \"fraude\" eleitoral. \"O regime de Maduro confirma o que a comunidade internacional vem denunciando: a fraude. Uma ditadura que fecha todas as portas para uma vida institucional e democrática para o seu povo. Não devemos nos calar nem cessar na defesa da causa venezuelana\", escreveu Lacalle Pou na rede social X. O Tribunal Supremo de Justiça (TSJ) da Venezuela certificou \"de forma inquestionável\" o resultado das eleições de 28 de julho, emitido pelo Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE), que proclamou Maduro como vencedor para o período de 2025-2031 com 52% dos votos. A oposição afirma ter vencido as eleições e acusa tanto o TSJ quanto o CNE de servirem a Maduro, no poder desde 2013. Liderados por María Corina Machado, os opositores afirmam que seu candidato, Edmundo González Uruttia, venceu com 67% dos votos e publicaram cópias das atas que, segundo eles, provam a vitória. Lacalle Pou questionou na própria noite da eleição a suposta vitória de Maduro e, posteriormente, o Uruguai foi um dos primeiros países a reconhecer a vitória de González. O governo de Lacalle Pou e outros da região estão discutindo um comunicado conjunto criticando a decisão do TSJ, segundo fontes do Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Uruguai. ad/arm/am © Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "En los últimos meses, se ha observado un aumento significativo en las [estafas realizadas a través de WhatsApp\n](https://www.bluradio.com/tecnologia/estafas-por-whatsapp-asi-les-estan-robando-y-clonando-la-cuenta-a-los-colombianos-so35). Los ciberdelincuentes han perfeccionado sus técnicas, utilizando métodos cada vez más sofisticados para engañar a los usuarios.\nEs así como una de las nuevas estrategias que los delincuentes están implementando se trata de suplantar la identidad del soporte técnico de la aplicación, buscando acceder a cuentas personales bancarias y estafar sus contactos.\nAsí le ocurrió Martha Pineda, quien fue víctima de suplantación vía WhatsApp, y contó a [Noticias Caracol\n](https://www.noticiascaracol.com/colombia/bogota/ojo-con-mensaje-de-soporte-tecnico-a-esta-bogotana-le-robaron-el-whatsapp-y-5-000-contactos-cb20) que le llegó un mensaje, donde le preguntaban si estaba intentando ingresar desde un Open 16, que si era ella, a lo que respondió que no en el chat. \"Me llegó un código y yo lo acepté. Inmediatamente, ingresaron a mi WhatsApp, me quedé sin mi cuenta, me bloquearon la línea y están estafando a las personas”, contó Pineda.\nLa mujer aseguró que dentro de sus contactos tenía más de 5.000 clientes, a quienes lees escribieron para estafarlos: \"Les preguntan qué reservas necesitan, porque la gente escribe a mi número. Ellos se hacen pasar por mí, les envían cotizaciones y les hacen consignar plata a las personas. Lógicamente, apenas consignan, bloquean los números”.\n[@unatalgorritos]Ir con mucho cuidado porfa 🙏🏻🙏🏻 //[#sabiasque][#noticia][#noticias][#noticiastiktok][#noticiasen1minuto][#videoinformativo][#aprendeentiktok][#aprendecontiktok][#estafa][#estafas][#alerta][#ultimahora][#datoscuriosos][#datospertubadores][#datosinteresantes][#interesting][#interesante][#curiosidades][#perturbador][#parati][#fyp][#viral][#trendy][#trending][#xzybca][#spain][#españa][♬ Paris - Else]\nAsí puede identificar si un mensaje de WhatsApp es una estafa\nRespecto a casos como estos, un experto de seguridad cibernética contó cómo identificar un fraude a través de la aplicación de mensajería. Estos son los puntos a tener en cuenta cuando le llegue un mensaje de un número desconocido:\n- Número que tenga el \"+57\", alertando que se trata de un teléfono común y no de la aplicación oficial.\n- Una imagen con el logo de WhatsApp que no está centrada y tiene baja calidad.\n- \"Nombre\" de 'support' con un emoji de candado, algo muy difícil de detectar.\n- Uso de negrilla en todo el mensaje, para que parezca 'oficial'.\n- Uso de lenguaje de posible 'ataque' a su privacidad para generar ansiedad.\n- Texto punteado para indicar el supuesto código que se enviará.\nUn detalle clave de este modus operandi es el uso de lenguaje alarmante y urgente, como frases en negrita y advertencias sobre posibles ataques. Esto busca desorientar a las víctimas y presionarlas para que actúen sin pensar.\nOtro indicio es que WhatsApp nunca solicita este tipo de datos a través de mensajes en la aplicación; los procesos de verificación suelen realizarse dentro de pantallas específicas.\nPublicidad\nEl experto recomienda ignorar y bloquear cualquier mensaje de este tipo, así como activar la verificación en dos pasos para proteger la cuenta. La educación digital y la precaución son las mejores herramientas para evitar caer en estas trampas.",

    "text": "7月30日15时49分，长征八号甲运载火箭在海南商业航天发射场成功发射，将卫星互联网低轨06组卫星送入预定轨道。作为面向商业航天市场的新一代运载工具，长八甲火箭通过一系列技术革新，提供了兼具安全性与经济性的解决方案。\n长八甲火箭基于长征八号基础型火箭改进而来，从方案设计到首飞仅耗时28个月，创造了中型运载火箭研制的“中国速度”。作为长征八号的升级版，长八甲火箭通过模块化组合与新材料应用，在不增加硬件成本的前提下，运载能力提升了55%，并构建起太阳同步轨道3吨、5吨和7吨级的运载能力梯队，能够满足未来主流中低轨道载荷发射需求。\n针对商业发射场紧凑的工位布局与严苛的成本控制，长八甲火箭采取了多项创新措施。例如，在新工位设计中，火箭与发射塔架的距离较传统工位显著缩小，可能存在碰撞风险。为此，研发团队在飞控系统中首创“起飞主动漂移控制”技术，使火箭点火离架瞬间能自主生成横向控制量，平稳向远离塔架方向漂移，从源头消除碰撞隐患。\n为了进一步降低成本，长八甲火箭采用“过冷液氧加注”技术，通过深度降低液氧温度提高密度，同等容积贮箱可承载更多燃料，实现发动机推力增强，运载能力提升约10%。同时，用锂离子电池全面替代传统锌银电池，不仅寿命长、免维护，还大幅降低了测试成本与状态切换风险。\n此外，长八甲火箭团队还创新研制出3.35米直径通用氢氧末级，搭配5.2米直径整流罩，使其整流罩与末级的直径比达到1.55，创长征系列火箭该比值之最。这种特殊比例打破了传统火箭的气动布局平衡，在高空风作用下容易晃动。为解决这一问题，研制团队提出自主姿态调整策略，在飞行过程中主动控制火箭滚转运动，使其整体平面迎风，通过两侧助推器的控制力来抵御风干扰，从而提高了火箭在恶劣天气下的发射概率。\n我国正研制新一代重型运载火箭长征九号，可重复使用的版本也在进一步规划中。作为火箭中的“大力士”，长征九号是载人登月、火星采样返回等任务不可或缺的运载工具\n北京时间2025年4月27日23时54分，我国在西昌卫星发射中心使用长征三号乙运载火箭成功将天链二号05星送入预定轨道，标志着此次发射任务圆满成功\n今日上午7时许，长征十二号遥二运载火箭已转运至海南商业航天发射场二号工位，将择机实施发射任务。该消息由博主@SpaceLens 云上天镜和@北斗_玉衡分享",
