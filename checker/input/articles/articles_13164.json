    "title": "Investor wariness drags down global deal activity by 4% YoY during January-May 2025, reveals GlobalData",
    "text": "18 Jun, 2025 Investor wariness drags down global deal activity by 4% YoY during January-May 2025, reveals GlobalData\nPosted inBusiness Fundamentals\nThe global deal landscape has been experiencing a downturn in 2025 with the first five months of the year seeing a decline in deal volume compared to the same period in the previous year. The total number of deals (mergers & acquisitions (M&A), private equity and venture financing) announced globally year-on-year (YoY) decreased by around 4% during January-May 2025. This dip is attributed to cautious investor sentiment and economic uncertainty, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\nAurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “Factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and regulatory scrutiny are forcing deal-makers to adopt a wait-and-watch approach before committing to significant transactions.”\nAn analysis of GlobalData’s Deals Database revealed that M&A continue to dominate the deal-making arena, yet they too have experienced a contraction. During January-May 2025, the total number of M&A deals announced globally registered a YoY fall of around 3%, suggesting that while companies remain active in pursuing strategic growth through acquisitions, caution is prevailing in the face of economic uncertainties.\nPrivate equity transactions have also declined approximately 6%. Meanwhile, venture financing has seen a relatively more pronounced decline of around 7%. The downturn in venture financing is particularly concerning as it suggests a tightening of capital availability for startups and emerging companies. Investors seem to be becoming increasingly selective, prioritizing established businesses over early-stage ventures.\nDeal activity has softened across all regions but not all are experiencing the same level of downturn. North America, which has historically been a leader in deal-making, experienced a decrease of around 4%. This decline is primarily driven by reduced activity in the US.\nConversely, Asia-Pacific has seen decline, albeit at a much lower rate, indicating a broader global trend. The total number of deals announced in the region fell by around 2% YoY during January-May 2025. Europe, Middle East and Africa, South and Central America also saw respective deal volume fall by around 6%, 9% and 12%.\nMeanwhile, the deal-making trend is not uniform among different countries with the downturn very evident in some markets whereas some markets showcased growth. Top markets such as the US, China and the UK witnessed YoY decline in deal volume by around 4%, 7% and 8%, respectively, during January-May 2025.\nOn the other hand, India and Japan have emerged as bright spots with YoY increase in deal volume of around 7% and 23%, respectively. The deal volume of other markets such as France, Finland, Hong Kong, Belgium and Saudi Arabia also improved.\nBose concludes: “While the overall decline in deal activity raises concerns, it is essential to recognize the regional disparities and market-specific dynamics at play as the emergence of some resilient markets offers a glimmer of hope.”\nNote: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.",

    "title": "These are the pro-Iranian militias attacking US bases and sending drones to Eilat",
    "text": "A Lebanese journalist reported Thursday that the \"Islamic Resistance in Iraq,\" a group composed of pro-Iranian militias operating in Iraq and Syria, attacked the Pik airfield south of Moshav Eliad in the Golan Heights which the Elbit security company uses to test UAVs and air defense systems. Read more: These pro-Iranian militias have also been responsible for attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria in recent months. Recently, they even launched a drone toward Eilat, and took credit for it. In Iraq and Syria, there has been a noticeable escalation in attacks against American forces since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. According to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq is, in fact, a relatively new union of several well-established militias supported by Iran: Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya, and Imam Ali. These armed groups chose to unite and call themselves the \"Islamic Resistance in Iraq\" last October. A senior Pentagon official confirmed to the Al-Miyadin network on Wednesday that \"American forces and coalition forces were exposed to 106 attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria since October 17.\" Also on Wednesday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the drone attack on the American military base in Erbil. The group said that in addition to firing toward the Golan Heights, they also attacked a site in Erbil associated with Israel. The fact that the recent claims of responsibility are attributed to the umbrella organization and not to a specific militia serves the interests of these militias. In recent months, reports have emerged of differences among the organizations regarding fighting against the U.S. in Iraq and Syria. Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that during most of the cease-fire in the Gaza war, most factions supported ending attacks on Americans since the fighting was conducted \"in support of the Gaza front.\" Other factions refused to stop attacks. When the Gaza fighting resumed, so did the attacks on American bases in Syria and Iraq. On Tuesday, sources close to Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq reported that the terror group is preparing for a new round of escalation against American bases. According to the report, the escalation \"will include missile attacks and drone strikes in response to American attacks and retaliation for [the assassination of IRGC official Sayyed Reza Mousavi in Damascus by Israel.](https://www.ynetnews.com/Iran reports senior IRGC officer killed in Israeli airstrike in Syria)\" One source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that discussions between the militias and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi have reached a standstill and have been suspended. According to the same source, the Iraqi prime minister \"wants to cease attacks on American bases without any reciprocal commitments, without the departure of the Americans, without reviewing the security agreement with them, and without stopping the attacks in Gaza – essentially an unconditional victory.\" Iraq's Kadhimi has been actively working in recent months, both against the militias and Iran, to try to stop the attacks on American bases. His attempts have so far been unsuccessful. \"The government is moving toward the end of the international coalition's presence in Iraq,\" according to the prime minister. \"The Iraqi government is capable of committing to protecting diplomatic missions. The war in the Gaza Strip has exposed the failure of the international system to achieve security and stability.\"",

    "text": "MoneyDJ新聞 2025-05-08 07:36:37 記者 黃文章 報導美國能源部5月7日公佈，截至5月2日，美國商業原油庫存較前週減少200萬桶至4.384億桶，較過去5年的同期平均值減少7%；汽油庫存增加20萬桶至2.257億桶，較過去5年的同期平均值減少3%；蒸餾油庫存減少110萬桶至1.067億桶，較過去5年的同期平均值減少13%。 5月2日當週，美國煉油廠日均原油加工量1,610萬桶，較前週減少0.7萬桶；煉油廠產能利用率較前週的88.6%增加至89%。汽油日均產量較前週950萬桶增加至970萬桶，蒸餾油日均產量較前週的460萬桶增加至470萬桶。 美國當週原油進口量平均每日600萬桶，較前週增加55.7萬桶。過去四週的原油進口量平均約每日580萬桶，比去年同期減少13.3%。當週汽油日均進口量（包括成品汽油和汽油混合成分）76.5萬桶，蒸餾油日均進口量11.7萬桶。汽油日均需求較前週的909.8萬桶減少至871.7萬桶，相比去年同期為879.7萬桶。 作為需求的指標，上週油品日均供應量增加72萬桶。過去4週，美國日均油品供應量為1,980萬桶，較去年同期減少0.6%；其中，汽油日均供應量年增3.5%至890萬桶，蒸餾油日均供應量年增3.1%至370萬桶，航空煤油日均供應量年增16.4%至185.7萬桶。 5月2日當週，美國原油日均產量較前週減少10萬桶至1,336.7萬桶。美國能源部月報表示，2025年美國原油產量預估將年增20萬桶至每日1,340萬桶，2026年達到1,350萬桶/日。當週美國原油日均出口量較前週的412.1萬桶減少至400.6萬桶。 美國能源部預估，阿拉斯加原油產量預計在2026年增加16,000桶/日，達到438,000桶/日，結束多年下降趨勢。阿拉斯加的年均原油產量曾在1988年達到200萬桶/日的峰值，此後因油田成熟導致產量下降、可租賃土地有限以及勘探和開發成本高昂等因素，產量持續下滑。 5月2日當週，美國主要的原油進口來源國（依2023年前十大進口來源國排序）包括：加拿大（383.4萬桶/日）、墨西哥（38.4萬桶/日）、沙烏地阿拉伯（16萬桶/日）、伊拉克（22.9萬桶/日）、哥倫比亞（16.4萬桶/日）、巴西（8.6萬桶/日）、奈及利亞（8.3萬桶/日）、委內瑞拉（14.4萬桶/日）、厄瓜多（15.6萬桶/日）、利比亞（2.9萬桶/日）。 美國能源部月報預估，2025年與2026年全球石油需求將分別增加約100萬桶/日與90萬桶/日，但供應成長更快，導致油市庫存累積。報告表示：「預期全球石油庫存在2025年將開始增加，2025年第二季平均每日增加50萬桶，至第四季增至70萬桶。預計2025年全年平均每日庫存增幅為40萬桶，並在2026年加速至平均每日80萬桶。」 美國今年石油需求預估將增長20萬桶/日，至2,050萬桶/日，2026年需求則預期下滑10萬桶至2,040萬桶/日。報告預測，印度在2025年將增加20萬桶/日的液體燃料消費，2026年增加30萬桶/日，相較於2024年的增幅20萬桶/日，增長主要受到交通燃料需求上升的推動。中國在2025年與2026年的液體燃料消費將各增長20萬桶/日。 報告預估，全球液體燃料的產量在2025年與2026年將分別增加約130萬至140萬桶/日，主要由OPEC+以外國家的產量成長所帶動。報告預估OPEC+在2025年的原油產量將小幅成長10萬桶/日，相較於2024年減產140萬桶/日的情況，並在2026年進一步增加60萬桶/日。OPEC+以外的國家在2025年將增加120萬桶/日，2026年則增加60萬桶/日。 （圖片來源：MoneyDJ理財網資料庫） ＊編者按：本文僅供參考之用，並不構成要約、招攬或邀請、誘使、任何不論種類或形式之申述或訂立任何建議及推薦，讀者務請運用個人獨立思考能力，自行作出投資決定，如因相關建議招致損失，概與《精實財經媒體》、編者及作者無涉。",

    "text": "2023 problems and peeves given a symbolic farewell at pre-New Year’s Times Square event Good Riddance Day, a before New Year event in New York, draws several people NEW YORK — One person wanted to get past anger issues. Others sought to turn the page on medical bills, work stress, insecurities, taxes, regrets, bad habits, bad hair days, COVID-19, worrying about what other people think, and “all negativity of 2023.” People hoping to shed those and other problems converged on Times Square in New York Thursday for “Good Riddance Day,” a promotional pre-New Year’s Eve event that offers a chance to, at least symbolically, cast away burdens, peeves and bad memories. Watching negative energy go up in smoke “The whole world is going through this. There’s lots of people going through bad experiences. Wars, inflation, life has been rough. I’m just hoping for 2024 to just give everyone a break from those terrible things,” Angel Villaneuva of Washington said after watching his personal banes — bad relationships and negative energy and experiences — go up in smoke. Previous iterations of “Good Riddance Day” have involved shredders and a dumpster. But this year, Magician Devonte Rosero took a grill lighter to pieces of paper on which Villaneuva and others had written down what they wanted to put behind them. From unhealthy snacks to conflict around the world For Carol Vera, that’s fast food and unhealthy snacks, now that she’s learned she has high cholesterol levels. But on a broader level, the New Yorker is sad about conflict around the world. “We should be focusing on humanity, instead of fighting with each other,” Vera said. Natasha Naheir was keen to be done with college applications, school, bad hair and makeup days, and fake friends. Naheir, who was visiting from North Carolina, is excited for 2024: “There’s a lot we can improve from this year,” she said. Despite all the troubles of 2023, Villaneuva is optimistic, too. “Some people might think it’s too good to be true to be hopeful or to wish for something, but I like to stay hopeful and positive,” he said.

    "text": "Heart-stopping footage has emerged of water police rescuing passengers from a capsized yacht during a thunder storm. Gold Coast water police responded to calls for assistance at 10pm on Christmas night after severe storms lashed the region. Officers found the partially capsized yacht near Crab Island and South Stradbroke Island with two people onboard. Footage of the rescue shows police battling against heavy rain and large waves to board the yacht where one officer said the two people were \"trapped\". Bolts of lightning illuminate the chaotic scene, recorded on police bodycam, as the passengers are escorted to safety. Both people were not physically injured and were taken to Labrador on the Gold Coast. Police said a number of [requests for assistance](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/policelink-reporting) were received after the major storms with \"fallen trees, powerlines and other safety hazards continuing to be observed\". The public has been urged by [police ](https://www.crimestoppersqld.com.au/)to \"avoid driving, stay home if possible, and be aware of areas still affected by power outages\". \"All attempts are being made by officers to attend locations that require assistance.\" Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "title": "Юрист Черных-Аипов: новости о запрете теплиц безосновательны",
    "text": "Информация о запрете строительства теплиц на землях сельхозназначения не соответствует действительности. Законодательных оснований для таких ограничений нет, а распространяемые в интернете сообщения преувеличены. Об этом сообщил заместитель председателя коллегии адвокатов «Сулим и партнеры» Даниил Черных-Аипов.\n«Прямых отсылок в поправках к регулирующему законодательству с 1 мая не усматривается, при этом информация, растиражированная в интернете, имеет больше эмоциональную, а не реальную законодательную окраску. Очевидно, что речь идет о неких „мифических ограничениях“, и их масштаб искусственно преувеличен. Земли сельхозназначения по своему правовому статусу как раз предназначены для выращивания сельскохозяйственных культур, в том числе в теплицах. Никаких ограничений на этот счет нет и не предусматривалось», — рассказал агентству «Прайм» Черных-Аипов.\nОн отметил, что штрафы за теплицы возможны только в отдельных случаях — если нарушены градостроительные нормы или капитальные постройки возводятся там, где это запрещено. По словам юриста, это не новые правила.\nРанее сообщалось, что с 2025 года владельцы дачных участков должны соблюдать обновленные требования к капитальным постройкам, в том числе к теплицам, если они имеют фундамент и стационарные коммуникации — такие объекты подлежат обязательной регистрации. За невыполнение этих правил постройку могут демонтировать по решению суда. Также владельцам садовых участков напомнили о штрафах за запрещенные растения и грибы.\nСохрани номер URA.RU - сообщи новость первым!\nНе упустите шанс быть в числе первых, кто узнает о главных новостях России и мира!

    "text": "En Directo\nOriente Próximo\nGuerra de Israel y Gaza, en directo: últimas noticias del conflicto en Oriente Próximo\nSigue el minuto a minuto de la ofensiva de Israel sobre Gaza y la tensión bélica entre el estado hebreo e Irán\nRedacción\nLa tensión en Oriente Próximo sigue amenazando con un conflicto mayor tras propagarse más allá de la guerra entre\n[Israel](/tags/israel/) y [Hamás](/tags/hamas/). La ofensiva del ejército israelí en Gaza, desencadenada tras los atentados de la organización islamista en el país hebreo el pasado mes de octubre, ya se ha cobrado miles de víctimas en la Franja. Pero el bombardeo por parte de Israel de un edificio consular iraní en Damasco y la respuesta de [Irán](/tags/iran/) con el lanzamiento de un ataque sin precedentes con drones y misiles sobre suelo israelí han escalado la preocupación sobre el nivel de la crisis.\nIsrael ataca posiciones de milicias proiraníes en Siria tras un ataque contra los Altos del Golán\nEl Ejército de Israel ha atacado posiciones de milicias proiraníes en Siria en respuesta a un ataque previo atribuido a estos grupos armados contra los ocupados Altos del Golán, un intercambio de hostilidades que se han visto incrementados desde el inicio de la guerra en la Franja de Gaza. Las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) han afirmado en un comunicado publicado en su página web que durante la noche del domingo se registrado \"dos lanzamientos desde territorio sirio\" y han agregado que \"impactaron en espacios abiertos\". \"No hay víctimas\", han subrayado.\nAl menos tres heridos en un bombardeo israelí contra un fábrica en el este del Líbano\nAl menos tres personas resultaron heridas este lunes a causa de un bombardeo israelí contra una fábrica en el Valle de la Bekaa, una región en el este del\n[Líbano](/tags/libano/) alejada de la frontera común donde se suelen concentrar las hostilidades entre el grupo chií [Hizbulá](/tags/hizbula/) y el Estado judío. Cazas israelíes atacaron de madrugada un edificio ubicado en la localidad de Sefri, hiriendo a tres civiles y destruyendo el inmueble objetivo de la acción, cuyos escombros quedaron esparcidos por una carretera cercana, según informó la Agencia Nacional de Noticias (ANN). El Valle de la Bekaa es un importante bastión de Hizbulá y en los últimos meses ha sido bombardeado por Israel en varias ocasiones, si bien el fuego cruzado entre las partes se sigue concentrando principalmente en las áreas cercanas a la divisoria de facto entre los dos países.\nIsrael envía órdenes de evacuación a gazatíes del este de Rafah\nLos residentes de los barrios orientales de la ciudad sureña de Rafah, próximos al denominado corredor Filadelfia fronterizo con Egipto, recibieron mensajes de voz instándolos a evacuar y dirigirse hacia la \"zona humanitaria\" de Al Mawasi.\n\"De acuerdo con la aprobación del Gobierno (israelí), una evaluación de la situación en curso guiará el movimiento gradual de civiles de las áreas especificadas hacia el área humanitaria\" de Al Mawasi, dijo hoy el Ejército en un comunicado castrense.\nEl Ejército de Israel pide a los palestinos abandonar Rafá \"inmediatamente\" ante una inminente ofensiva\nEl Ejército de Israel ha pedido a los palestinos este lunes abandonar \"inmediatamente\" la ciudad de Rafá, en el sur de la Franja de Gaza, ante una inminente ofensiva en la que las tropas israelíes \"usarán una fuerza extrema contra organizaciones terroristas\" en las zonas residenciales.\n\"Un llamamiento urgente a todos los residentes y desplazados en la zona del municipio de Al Shuka y en los barrios de Al Salam, Al Jeneina, Tabbat Ziraa y Al Byuk en la ciudad de Rafá: las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) usarán una fuerza extrema contra las organizaciones terroristas en las zonas donde residen, como lo han hecho hasta ahora.
