    "title": "The Walking Dead Dog Seven Dies: \"Best TV Buddy Ever\"",
    "text": "The Walking Dead's Dog, Seven, Has Died: \"Best TV Buddy Ever\" Daryl actor Norman Reedus paid tribute to Seven, the animal actor who played Dog on The Walking Dead. Seven, the beloved Belgian Malinois who played Daryl Dixon's dog on [The Walking Dead](/category/the-walking-dead/), has died. On Thursday, network AMC and the official Walking Dead social media accounts announced the animal actor's death with a tribute to the zombie drama's \"best boy.\" A cause of death was not disclosed. [Seven](/category/seven/) appeared in 25 episodes of the series since the season 9 episode \"Stradivarius\" in 2018, which introduced the dog — named Dog — as the canine companion of Daryl (Norman Reedus). \"Gonna miss u Seven,\" Reedus wrote on Instagram Stories. \"Best TV buddy ever.\" 🚨 NEWS: According to Norman Reedus’ Story on Instagram- Sadly, Dog from— Aaron (@AaronsArmTWD) [#TheWalkingDead]has sadly passed away 😭🐕❤️ [pic.twitter.com/EOgGF62kvV] [June 13, 2024] The dog was named \"Dog\" by his original owner, Leah (Lynn Collins), Daryl's lover when he spent six years [living alone in the woods](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-walking-dead-daryl-dog-origin-story-revealed-leah-lynn-collins-find-me/) while looking for Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln). When Leah disappeared from her cabin in the woods in the season 10 episode \"Find Me,\" Daryl adopted Dog as his own. Reedus spent years asking the Walking Dead producers to [give Daryl a dog](https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/news/the-walking-dead-daryl-dog-carol-907-sneak-peek-clip/). During a visit to the Georgia set in 2018, Reedus gushed to ComicBook about working with Seven. \"It's so good,\" Reedus exclusively [told ComicBook](https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/news/the-walking-dead-daryl-dog-name-pet/) at the time. \"I love it. I think he's the smartest cast member we got. We just did a scene the other day that ended up being the opposite of what it was supposed to be because the dog just wanted to do something else, and it came out so much better. He'll probably be running the show. It's great! I love it. He loves me, too.\" Dog's role came about as a way to \"show the state that Daryl's in\" after the missing Rick was thought dead, showrunner Angela Kang explained in a [2018 interview](https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/news/the-walking-dead-daryl-dog-live-die-showrunner-angela-kang/). \"And I thought that it would be great that he's been off for a while after Rick's presumed death. Daryl just went off. And Daryl is somebody who hunts and goes about and does things, and it seemed like a dog is a good companion. It shows that there's still a desire for him to have a connection somehow. And so the dog is his faithful companion.\" Seven drew praise from David Boyd, who directed [Dog's origin story episode](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-walking-dead-daryl-dog-origin-story-revealed-leah-lynn-collins-find-me/). \"Find Me\" flashed back to Daryl's first meeting with the zombie-fighting dog as [a seemingly stray pup](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-wanted-keep-daryl-dog-puppy-find-me/) (played by a younger dog actor, named Carl). \"I won't stop talking about Dog. That animal is fantastic,\" Boyd told [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/walking-dead-director-gushes-over-shows-best-doggone-actor_n_60425b9dc5b60208555e4897) in a 2021 interview. \"[Seven] has a brain, and he's got an acting spirit. In prep, you go, 'This dog is never going to do any of it,' right? You read the script and you go, 'OK, he goes there and stops there and he barks there. It's never going to happen. It's going to take 19 hours to get one thing out of this dog.' But no. Take one. Boom! We go, OK. We look at each other and say, 'Well, do we need another take?'\" \"There's a little bit scripted where at the beginning of the episode, dog runs right at camera and is supposed to come to a screeching halt and kick up some dust. And we read that and go, 'Well, that's never gonna happen,' and take one. Perfect. We just said, 'Well, what the hell? Now we're an hour ahead. Let's do another take.' And same thing. Perfect. Exactly right. Excellent,\" Boyd continued, adding that Seven was capable of performing even the most complicated commands. \"[Seven's trainers] go, 'Well, I don't know.' Damned if that dog didn't do it. Every single bit of it. That dog can perform for four minutes and just keep going. That's amazing. I love him.\" Collins also fondly remembered working with her animal co-star, telling [Den of Geek ](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-walking-dead-dog-carl-real-name-seven/)in 2021: \"[Seven's] actually an older guy. He's not a pup. And so he is really comfortable on set and really easy to work with and super loving and the trainers are incredible. So it was really easy to just sit with him and pet him and love on him. I think literally at one point they were like, 'Lynn, stop playing with him. He's not going to be able to focus.' That's how sweet and loving this dog was.\" Seven's Dog last appeared in The Walking Dead's \"Rest in Peace\" series finale in November 2022.

    "title": "Fog Disrupts Flight Operations In Delhi, Very Dense Fog Likely On The Weekend",
    "text": "Visibility conditions at Palam airport dropped to zero disrupting air operations. Nil visibility descended on the airfield in the wee hours today and continued till past 1000hr. The visibility has since improved and the RVR ( runway visual range) has become better at facilitating normal flying operations. However, the cascading effect of the delayed operations, since morning, will continue for some more time.\nYesterday also, the horizontal visibility had dropped to zero, between 6 and 8.30 in the morning leading to flight restrictions. The weekend ahead is not going to be any better and rather very dense fog is expected for longer durations. Air travellers may please make a note of it and cater for the exigencies.\nAt Delhi airport, three runways are equipped with ILS ( Instrument Landing System), to negotiate poor visibility conditions. Runways 11, 28 and 29 comply with CAT-III operations under bad weather conditions, albeit with their own limitations. CAT-III is invoked during poor visibility conditions largely due to fog but can be introduced for any other aviation hazard, as well, as reducing visibility. CAT-III comes into practice when the visibility plummets to under 200 mtrs. CAT-III A comes when the RVR drops to 175mtrs or more and CAT-III B is called for the RVR between 75 and 175 mtrs. The most difficult and decisive stage is CAT-III C when the RVR sinks to 50 meters. The airfield is generally closed for operations when the RVR goes less than 50 meters. The limitations for the aircraft operations underline visibility to be a\nminimum of 50 meters for landing and at least 125 meters for take off, at any given point of time, subject to a decision height of 15 meters. For CAT-III operations, both the man and machine, have limitations and need strict compliance of the procedure and capability.\nDelhi has recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 7°C, today morning. This is the lowest in the last 2 weeks, since 21st Dec 2024. Also, parts of Delhi have registered fifth consecutive cold day conditions. Even, the airport observatory Palam recorded the day maximum of 13.5°C, over 5°C below the normal. The minimum temperature, yesterday and today was nearly stuck at 6.5°C, a shade below the normal. The minimum temperature is likely to rise over the weekend due to changes in winds. However, the day temperature is likely to lower because of clouding in association with the approach of western disturbance. A brief and light spell of rain is quite likely over the city and outskirts on 06th Jan.\nImage Courtesy: Canva",
