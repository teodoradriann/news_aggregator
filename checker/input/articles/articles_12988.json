    "text": "Sonoma County food banks struggling to meet continuous high demand\nUntil April, Santa Rosa resident Danielle Bayuk, 39, was able to afford food for her three kids without having to visit food banks. Then,\nemergency allotments for CalFresh and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants ended, and Bayuk’s regular benefit amount couldn’t buy enough groceries for her family.\n“I didn’t have to go (to the food bank) at all during COVID, but as soon as we all went back to work and things got back to normal, I started to go to a food bank every Wednesday and to another that’s every other Saturday.”\nOver the past year, people who’ve never faced food insecurity in their lives have found themselves in line at one of Sonoma County’s food banks as the cost of food, gas, rent and other essentials grew to be more than they could afford.\nDemand has been so high that Redwood Empire Food Bank, the main food bank in the county, is seeing a budget shortfall of just over $1 million halfway through its fiscal year.\nSparse donations, continuous high demand\nAround the region, food banks have grappled to meet demand as donations fall off but food and operating costs remain high.\nRedwood Empire Food Bank CEO David Goodman said the food bank has a $1.27 million dollars shortfall in a fiscal year that runs July 1 to June 30, 2024. He added that the food bank’s annual budget is $21 million.\nThe\nfood bank partners with 150 organizations and serves more than 300 monthly distribution sites across Sonoma, Lake, Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte counties. The Friday just before the Christmas holiday more than 300 people stood in line to receive food at a grocery distribution at one of those sites in Roseland.\nWithout support, Goodman said, it may have to alter the types of food it provides clients, the areas it covers and other aspects of the operation.\nThe shortfall could also force it to either give participants less food or give the same amount of food to fewer people.\n“It’s the last thing a hunger relief worker wants to say,” Goodman said. “If we don’t have the money, we can’t serve people.”\nGoodman said higher prices on goods have hurt everyone’s pocketbook, meaning donations have not been as plentiful as in the past.\n“The way it works is that when there’s a need, we serve that need,” he said. “For some reason this year, the support is just shy. Everybody’s giving a little bit less but it adds up.”\nGoodman said the agency is hoping new and existing supporters will step in to help.\nFood banks across the state, and country, have seen increased demand for food since late 2022 when prices on gas and groceries began to skyrocket.\nPrices on groceries aren’t rising as quickly, but many are still finding it hard to afford food and groceries on top of other bills.\nSonoma County food banks have been able to meet this demand so far, but are quickly reaching the point at which they cannot serve any more people.\nElisha’s Pantry, one of the partner organizations, distributes food outside of Christ Church United Methodist every Thursday. This year it has served a record amount of people since its opening in July 2005.\n“When we started out, we had on average 40 families coming and now we have 180 families,” said Stephen Harper, member of the Pantry’s steering committee, said. “One of our concerns is we are running out of space to keep enough food on hand to feed more people.”\nElisha’s Pantry is run by three faith-based organizations in Sonoma County. It sometimes gets food donations from grocery stores and orchards, but it mostly buys its food from Redwood Empire Food Bank.\nAs demand grew, the Pantry had a small building and a box car to expand storage capacity. Harper said the food bank just recently opened up a bigger building but there’s still concern that there still won’t be enough storage to serve clients.\n“We’ve been able to handle this (demand) but we’re at the point where we’re starting to talk about what we are going to do,” Harper said. “Are we going to keep allowing the pantry to expand or are we going to have to cut it off somehow?”\nFood banks using more of annual budgets for food\nWhen the emergency allotments for CalFresh and SNAP participants ended, the California Association of Food Banks immediately began hearing about the increase in need food bank operators were seeing in their communities.\n“The vast majority of food banks received more calls from community members seeking food compared with the preceding months,” said Becky Silva, director of government relations with the California Association of Food Banks.\nSilva said three quarters of food banks had to increase their fundraising efforts, with two thirds having to use a disproportionate share of their annual budgets to keep supplying current levels of food.\nShe added that some food banks are starting to talk about shuttering pantries.\n“ (Food banks) just don’t have the food and the resources to sustain them anymore and it’s been a real challenging situation for most food banks around the state,” Silva said.\nSilva said there are\na handful of federal and state policies in the works aiming to prevent hunger. Some involve permanently increasing the minimum CalFresh benefit for all households to at least $50 per month or expanding the eligibility and ending exclusionary rules for SNAP and CalFresh benefits.\nConversations continue\nJennifer Emery is executive director at F.I.S.H. of Sonoma County and said its food pantry received a large influx of donations during the pandemic, which allowed clients to receive grocery allotments twice a month.\nBut with that money gone and sparser donations, the food pantry is cutting back client participation to once a month as of January.\nEmery wasn’t able to provide how much the pantry’s yearly operation costs were, but said as of late, they rarely receive “more than we spend hence why our reserves from COVID have been depleted.”\nShe added the food pantry’s participation is up about 20% from around this time last year as it serves around 100 families a day, five days a week.\n“We just can’t sustain it twice a month and with the increase in clientele and decrease in donations, it’s just not sustainable,” Emery said. “These are ongoing conversations on a daily basis in our organization.”\nYou can reach Staff Writer Sara Edwards at 707-521-5487 or sara.edwards@pressdemocrat. com.

    "title": "Worrying increase in colorectal cancer rates among people under 50 worldwide",
    "text": "⇧ [VIDÉO] You might also like this partner content\nThe number of people under the age of 50 diagnosed with colorectal cancer is increasing worryingly globally, according to a recent survey. While previous studies indicated an increase in high-income countries, this trend would now also be observed across different types of economies, including developing countries. This increase is probably due to the increase in unhealthy eating habits and metabolic diseases.\nAffecting nearly 2 million people per year worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death. The 5-year survival rate is around 90% if diagnosed early, but does not exceed 10% if diagnosed late. While the disease was initially thought to primarily affect older adults, studies have reported increasing incidence rates among younger adults (under 50), particularly in high-income countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nOn the other hand, trends are generally decreasing or stable among those over 50, probably due to the reduction of risk factors (stopping smoking and alcohol, improving diet, etc.) and efforts raising awareness of early detection. An increase in the rate of colorectal cancer among young adults (or early-onset colorectal cancer) has also been observed in South Korea and Hong Kong, but in parallel with that among older adults.\nHowever, the survey co-led by the American Cancer Society indicates that the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer is a global phenomenon and not limited to high-income countries. “\nThe increase in early-onset colorectal cancers is a global phenomenon “, Hyuna Sung, senior scientist in charge of cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study, told the Guardian. “ Previous studies have shown this increase primarily in high-income Western countries, but it is now documented in various economies and regions around the world. ».\nAn increase in 27 out of 50 countries\nAs part of their investigation, Sung and colleagues compared trends in colorectal cancer incidence among young adults to those among older adults, using data from 50 different countries and territories between 2007 and 2017. on disease incidence come from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus database of the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer. Human development index data (the rate of development of countries based on the quality of life of citizens) comes from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).\nAccording to the results, published in the journal Lancet\nOncologycolorectal cancer rates among adults aged 25 to 49 increased in 27 of the 50 countries studied. The largest annual increases are seen in New Zealand (4%), Chile (4%), Puerto Rico (3.8%) and England (3.6%), indicating the diversity of countries. The incidence appears to be increasing more rapidly among women than men in England, Norway, Australia, Turkey, Costa Rica and Scotland.\nAn increase due to poor eating habits\nAlthough the potential causes are not yet clear, researchers believe the rise is due to increases in poor eating habits, physical inactivity and metabolic diseases, such as obesity, among young adults. This growing trend among those under 50 could also lead to an increase in prevalence among older adults over the coming decades.\n« The global scale of this worrying trend highlights the need for innovative tools to prevent and control cancers linked to dietary habits, physical inactivity and excess weight. “, says Sung. “ Continued efforts are essential to identify additional factors driving these trends and to develop effective prevention strategies tailored to younger generations and local resources worldwide », she adds.\nSee also\nHowever, the study has certain limitations. Data on early-onset colorectal cancer rates are limited to 2017 and may not reflect current trends. They also come from subnational registers and may not represent the entire population of each country. On the other hand, the rate of increase in England is surprisingly higher than in other UK countries (1.55% for Wales, 0.64% for Scotland and 0. 54% for Northern Ireland), raising questions about the reliability of the data.\n« Comparing international data on cancer rates is a difficult task, because the quality and availability of data varies widely, we must resist the urge to jump to conclusions, especially when the data is conflicting and complicated », Estimates David Robert Grimes, assistant professor of biostatistics at Trinity College Dublin, who was not involved in the study.\nFurthermore, although the rates seem to be increasing among young adults, they still remain low compared to those over 50. In the United Kingdom, for example, colorectal cancer represents only one in 20 cancers diagnosed in people under 50. Nevertheless, the study researchers believe that more awareness and information campaigns are needed among both young people and health care providers, in order to reduce mortality risks.",
