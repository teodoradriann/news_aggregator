    "title": "How ‘cheat days’ can actually speed up weight loss by revving up metabolism, according to dietitian",
    "text": "According to dieticians, taking short breaks in the diet could help speed up your metabolism and lead to longer-term weight loss.\nA break of a day or two could help mitigate the biological details that cause most dieters to gain weight when they leave a restrictive diet.\nSo-called “cheat days” increase the levels of a hormone in the body that helps us burn calories; In other words, it keeps your metabolism high.\n“Our metabolism slows down as we get smaller, we don’t need to burn as many calories,” said Brittany Werner, a Pennsylvania-based registered dietitian and founder of fitness training company Working Against Gravity.\nThis makes it easier for a calorie surplus to accumulate, leading to weight gain.\nAnd that’s why “drastically cutting calories doesn’t work in the long term,” Werner said.\nNutritionists have dispelled the myth that “cheat days” are for lazy dieters; In fact, they could help you lose even more weight.\nHowever, eating more over a period of time not only retains more muscle mass, which burns more calories, but it also “tricks” your metabolism into thinking you’re burning more fuel.\nTaking a break from a restrictive diet can revitalize you psychologically, Werner said.\nBusiness Insider. Previous studies have shown that when dieters look forward to a cheat meal at the end of the week, their eating habits are better overall, compared to those who maintain a strict, never-ending diet.\nCheat days “can really help you move forward to meet the next few months” of your diet and fitness goals, Werner said.\nPlus, your metabolism is a bit like a muscle: You need to work it frequently to stay very active, he suggests.\nResearch shows that when you lose weight, the body does not produce as much of the hunger-regulating hormone called leptin. But cheat days can cause a temporary increase in leptin, which speeds up your metabolism.\nA Swiss study showed that increasing calorie intake at a meal could increase the production of hormones that regulate body weight in\n30 per cent.\nAnother study of the\nUniversity of Western Australia They put obese men on two different diets over a four-month period: one that included diet breaks and one that didn’t. The group with breaks lost more weight, on average, than the group without breaks.\nIn general, Werner said, if you’re losing too much weight too quickly, you may not have enough energy to push your body to make positive changes in your fitness.\nEating a restrictive diet without cheat days could cause fatigue that makes it difficult to achieve your goals.\nBut the key to the cheat day concept is making sure you’re eating healthy portions.\nEating too much of a fun food could be\nconsidered a binge – a concern that deters many dieters from giving themselves a moment of indulgence.\nWerner recommends taking control of your cheat day planning. To start, Werner recommends considering a diet break every 12 to 16 weeks, for between one day and two weeks.\nIf you’re already fed up with your diet and feel fatigued before that marker, then you may be eating the wrong things, he said.\nBut be careful not to go more than a fortnight without dieting, Werner said, because it may be difficult to return to healthy eating habits.\n‘Allow yourself to eat some foods you haven’t eaten for a while and increase calories by a few hundred per day. That doesn’t mean it’s a pitched battle,” he said.\nIf you plan your indulgences this way, it might help you feel less guilty about indulging, Werner said.",

    "text": "(CNN) — A California man spent ten days stranded in the mountains after he got lost on a hike, relying in part on large volumes of water to survive. Lukas McClish, 34, set out for what he thought would be a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11, according to CNN affiliate KGO . But he became lost in the mountains – partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires . His family officially reported him missing when he didn’t show up for a Father’s Day dinner on June 16, triggering search and rescue efforts, KGO reported. McClish was eventually found on Thursday thanks to a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office, according to an X post from Cal Fire San Mateo, which said McClish was found in Big Basin Redwoods State Park – California’s oldest state park and home to towering ancient coast redwood trees. “There were multiple reports of witnesses hearing someone yelling for help, but the location of that person was hard to establish,” said Cal Fire. McClish was found with “no major injuries and was reunited with his family,” according to the sheriff’s office . Speaking with KGO, McClish said he was “tired and a little sore” after his ordeal. “I lost my voice,” he added. All he had to survive in the forest were the clothes he was wearing when he left: “I left with just a pair of pants, and my pair of hiking shoes, and a hat,” he told KGO. “I had a flashlight, and a pair of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool. And that was about it.” He attributed his survival to drinking lots of water from creeks and waterfalls he found as he hiked through the park each day, calling for help, according to CNN affiliate KSBW . “I just make sure I drank a gallon of water every day, but then after, getting close to the end of it, my body needed food and some kind of sustenance,” McClish told KGO. Seeing the number of search and rescue workers who worked to find him was “really humbling,” he said. “It was an awesome experience.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified a CNN affiliate that reported on Lukas McClish’s disappearance.

    "text": "ESCUCHA ESTA NOTICIA\n|\nCiudad del Vaticano.- El papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nEl papa Francisco pasó una noche tranquila y durante la mañana se ha dedicado a la lectura de la prensa, en el quinto día de hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma por «una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio», informó el portavoz Vaticano, Matteo Bruni.\nEl portavoz explicó que en la tarde de hoy se espera un nuevo parte médico sobre las condiciones de salud del papa.\nLos partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es «complejo», por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por «una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio», que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\nSin fiebre\n«El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables», se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban «una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia» de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el «cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada», lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.",
