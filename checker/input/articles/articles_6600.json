    "text": "Sóc Sơn waste-to-energy plant has power generating capacity of 90MW. — VNA/VNS Photo Trung Nguyên\nAs landfill solutions become increasingly outdated, the development of waste-to-energy plants is expected to be the key answer to environmental problems.\nNotably, waste-to-energy projects not only help to handle a large amount of waste but also provide a significant source of renewable energy.\nThe Government has been reiterating the message of 'not trading off the environment for economic growth' on many occasions, reflecting their consistent stance on environmental protection.\nHowever, with the advent of waste-to-energy technology, the concepts of 'environment and economy' can progress in tandem with no longer any need to trade off or sacrifice one for the other.\nViệt Nam is currently among the top 20 countries in the world with the largest amount of waste, exceeding the global averages, due to limited waste management and treatment facilities.\nIt is estimated that the average Vietnamese generates 1.2kg of waste per day (equivalent to nearly 70,000 tonnes across the whole country). Currently, over 70 per cent of waste in Việt Nam simply ends up in landfill, with only 13 per cent being incinerated to recover energy.\nNotably, landfill sites are becoming increasingly difficult to source, as the land available for this purpose is gradually shrinking.\nTo cope with this acute and growing problem, the development of waste-to-energy plants is seen as not only economically beneficial, but also as providing a significant and positive contribution to the environment.\nThe combination of modern science and technology with environmentally-friendly waste treatment processes creates a comprehensive solution for waste issues and sustainable energy production.\nThis helps solve the pressing issue of increasing and growing mountains of waste and the worsening air and water pollution levels.\nThus, the development of waste-to-energy plants is seen as a dual-benefit solution, expected to be a strategic approach that 'hits two targets with one arrow' addressing both economic and environmental concerns simultaneously.\nAccording to statistics from the Department of Environmental Pollution Control, Việt Nam currently has 15 waste-to-energy plants under construction, with three of them already generating electricity including the largest, the Sóc Sơn plant operated by the Hà Nội Thiên Ý Environmental Energy Joint Stock Company.\nThis has a treatment capacity of 1,000 tonnes per furnace per day, receiving 5,000 tonnes of waste daily and generating 90MW of electricity.\nThe Vĩnh Tân plant in Bình Thuận Province has a capacity of treating 600 tonnes of waste per day and generates 30MW of electricity.\nThe Phù Ninh plant in Phú Thọ Province can incinerate 500 tonnes of waste per day and generate 25MW of electricity, while the Củ Chi plant in HCM City can process 1,000 tonnes of waste per day and generate 50MW of electricity.\nThe Sóc Sơn plant is the biggest waste-to-energy plant in Việt Nam and the second largest in the world, after the Shenzhen plant in China.\nThe plant has 16 waste disposal gates, each designed to accommodate different types of rubbish trucks in Việt Nam and since becoming operational it has processed over 1.46 million tonnes of household solid waste.\nWise selection\nWaste incineration technology to generate electricity is increasingly favoured because of several advantages over other technologies, such as reducing waste volume and mass by 90-95 per cent, utilising heat, reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to landfill and minimising water pollution.\nHà Nội and HCM City which are the two largest urban cities with the highest daily waste generation in the country are understandably also the two most vigorously promoting waste-to-energy development.\nBesides accelerating the construction of waste-to-energy plants, the two cities are also focusing on improving waste treatment technology. HCM City aims to have 80 per cent of household waste treated with modern new technology by 2025 and 100 per cent by 2030.\nMeanwhile by the end of 2024, Hà Nội wants to have an additional 67MW in power generated in the Sóc Sơn Plant and increase the energy capacity a further 129.3MW, when the Seraphin waste-to-energy plant project is fully operational.\nThe city will continue to implement waste treatment projects in Chương Mỹ, Phú Xuyên, Thanh Trì, Gia Lâm districts and other areas. The construction of waste plants around the central area will help reduce transportation distances, lower costs and decrease the city's budget expenditures.\nHà Nội is also studying the possible use of wind power, as well as developing a network of electric charging stations and green energy supply stations for transportation.\nAssoc. Prof. Dr. Bùi Thị An, director of the Institute of Natural Resources, Environment, and Community Development, told Kinh tế & Đô Thị (Economic & Urban Affairs) newspaper under the municipal Hà Nội People's Committee: \"The environment is currently a very pressing issue, especially in terms of waste. To address the current environmental problems, one of the most important aspects is solving the waste problem. This must be a key focus when developing waste-to-energy solutions.\n“The crucial issue now is selecting the appropriate technology that can effectively manage waste without generating other harmful pollutants.\n“It is essential to thoroughly choose suitable technology without being tempted by lower costs, while ensuring transparency and openly considering the opinions of experts.”\nIn addition to fully exploiting technology, An said she believes that for waste-to-energy solution to truly succeed and achieve its full potential, waste classification at source is a crucial step.\n\"According to the experience of many countries around the world, to effectively manage waste, it is essential to optimise waste classification, transfer and collection before processing. If the classification is not done well, treatment process will be challenging,\" she said. — VNS",

    "text": "FRIENDSWOOD, Texas — A Texas teenager accused of shooting two people at his home, one fatally, allegedly told police that he wanted to \"commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to newly released court documents. The suspect -- 17-year-old Connor Hilton -- was showing the two victims a revolver at his Friendswood home Saturday night when he allegedly shot them both in the head, according to a complaint charging the teen with murder. A third person who was at the house that night called 911 while hiding in the bathroom and reported hearing two gunshots, according to the complaint. Responding officers found Hilton outside the home appearing \"visibly distraught,\" the complaint stated. When asked by police if anyone was hurt, Hilton nodded yes then held up two fingers, motioned toward the house and said there were two teenagers inside he believed to be dead, according to the complaint. Once inside, an officer found two male victims -- identified as Ethan Riley, 18, and Benjamin Bliek, 19 -- lying on the floor with gunshot wounds as well as a revolver on a table, according to the complaint. A second officer located the 911 caller, who \"reported hearing Hilton walk by the bathroom door crying and stating, 'What have I done,'\" the complaint stated. The shooting victims were transported to local hospitals in critical condition. Riley succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, while Bliek remains in critical condition, police said. Hilton was brought in for questioning following the shooting and was initially charged by the Galveston County District Attorney's Office with two counts of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He was released after posting $1 million bond before being arrested again at his home on Monday for murder, police said. He is currently being held at the Galveston County Jail on no bond. While being interviewed by police following the shooting, Hilton allegedly confessed to pulling the trigger and said there was no disturbance or disagreement that night, according to the complaint. He allegedly told police \"he had thought about, and wanted, to commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to the complaint. He allegedly said he had talked his mother into buying him a handgun, which he wanted \"with the intent of shooting someone and/or himself,\" according to the complaint. \"Hilton stated that he fully understands what he had done and that he should be held accountable,\" the complaint stated. Hilton's attorney, Jennifer Carpenter, told ABC News that his mother did not purchase a gun for him. \"The parents of Connor Hilton cannot express enough their deepest condolences to the victims' families who have been heavily on the Hiltons' hearts and minds as they try to navigate this devastating situation,\" Hilton's family said in a statement released through the attorney on Thursday. \"The Hilton family wants to thank everyone who has reached out in love and support, including all who sent positive comments about Connor's character and good nature in general,\" the statement continued. \"The family asks for continued prayers for everyone affected, especially the victims' families.\" His attorney has filed a motion seeking to conduct a hearing to determine whether his statements to police can be admissible in court, claiming they were not made and preserved in compliance with state law. Hilton is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference on Feb. 2, online court records show. Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Archaeologists Unearth Remarkable Lost Underwater Civilization Using Magnetic Field Technology\nThe more that time passes since the heyday of an ancient civilization, the more mysterious that civilization becomes. And while it's the life's work of archaeologists to unravel those mysteries, the ravages of time have a way of making that difficult. After all, archaeologists can only find the artifacts that managed to survive thousands of years of unpredictable natural processes. Nature has a way of destroying evidence.\nThis makes it especially exciting when an ancient civilization is discovered underwater, as finding ruins in the world's vast bodies of water is very much akin to finding a needle in a haystack. And that goes double when that discovery fundamentally changes people's understanding of the ancient world.\nThe mystique of Atlantis\nAlthough the lost city of Atlantis described by Plato only seems to exist in legends, that hasn't stopped people from holding out hope of its existence.\nFor many, the idea that an ancient civilization could still be thriving under the known world is an attractive proposition that inspires endless curiosity.\nThe reality of underwater discoveries\nBut while that thought remains attractive thousands of years after Plato's writings, it actually isn't unheard of for archaeologists to find deep-sea evidence of lost communities.\nAs is the case for this ancient Roman statue, these lost cities once stood on land but found themselves submerged amid changes in sea level and other natural forces.\nOne big discovery is even older\nBut while it doesn't evoke the kind of sophisticated wonder that imaginings of Atlantis tend to suggest, one lost ancient civilization has been the subject of great archaeological interest in recent decades.\nAnd that's partially because its existence fundamentally changes humanity's understanding of ancient Europe.\nWelcome to Doggerland\nAccording to National Geographic, the British Isles have only been islands for the last 6,000 years.\nBefore that, they were connected to the rest of Europe by an area known as Doggerland.\nNot just a land bridge\nAnd while the existence of this region explains how early humans were able to spread throughout Europe without having to deal with the North Sea, Doggerland was far more than a land bridge.\nFor humanity's earliest relatives, it was a paradise.\nAn oasis in a hard time\nNational Geographic reported that at the tail end of the last Ice Age, Doggerland was a lush region filled with rolling hills, densely wooded valleys, wetlands, and swamps.\nAs such, it was able to support a society of hunter-gatherers when much of the world at the time wasn't.\nThe name is much newer than the place\nAs disappointing as it may be to hear, this ancient area wasn't called Doggerland because it featured an abundance of dogs.\nInstead, The Guardian reported the name is based on a stretch of seabed known as the Dogger Bank that would have been part of the area. The bank is named for the \"dogger\" fishing boats that sailed the area during the 17th Century.\nSo many generations of hunter-gatherers\nAccording to The Guardian, Doggerland stood for long enough that not only were early humans able to forage there, but so too were the beings that predated them.\nAnd that's not limited to Neanderthals, as even the common ancestor humanity shares with them — known as Homo antecessor — had a chance to wander those ancient lands.\nA bountiful place\nThe residents of Doggerland migrated in pursuit of animals to hunt and fish to catch, but they also foraged for local plant-based food sources.\nHazelnuts and berries were notable examples of what one could expect to find in Doggerland.\nDoggerland leaves traces of itself millennia later\nSince Doggerland once connected the United Kingdom to the Netherlands (among other nations), artifacts dating back thousands of years have occasionally washed up on Dutch beaches.\nAnd while employees of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden often assist in analyzing these artifacts, The Guardian reported that it's not often archaeologists who find them.\nThe help of citizen scientists\nAccording to The Guardian, the museum has about 200 artifacts that originated from Doggerland. And while they largely consist of the fossils of hunted animals like mammoths, deer, and hyenas, there's also a fragment of a young male Neanderthal among them.\nAnd as the museum's assistant curator — Dr. Sasja van der Vaart-Verschoof — said, \"We have a wonderful community of amateur archaeologists who almost daily walk these beaches and look for the fossils and artifacts.\"\nAnother watershed change in the world's history\nBut one of the most important discoveries to come from Doggerland wasn't a fossil at all. Instead, it's a flint tool dating back about 50,000 years that was made from the pitch of a birch tree.\nWhat makes this tool so important is the fact that it demonstrates the Neanderthals weren't quite as primitive as humanity once thought. As The Guardian put it, they were \"capable of precise and complex multi-staged tasks.\"\nNothing lasts forever\nWhile it existed above the surface, the abundance of natural resources on Doggerland made it no less than the heart of Europe for its many generations of inhabitants.\nBut as the Ice Age drew to a close, this vast region slowly started to vanish.\nThe results of an Ice Age ending\nAlthough Doggerland was a key refuge during the latter portions of the Ice Age, it was also destroyed by the very processes that drew the harsh period to a close.\nAccording to National Geographic, most of Doggerland slowly submerged over the course of a millennium due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which caused sea levels to rise three to six feet per century.\nIt was slow, but it added up\nAlthough this process sounded slow and incremental, it was fast enough to fundamentally change the landscape of Doggerland.\nAccording to the Smithsonian Magazine, it only took 1,000 years for Doggerland to flood to the extent that it transformed from a consistent landmass to an archipelago of islands.\nAccelerated by catastrophe\nBut while this trend was always going to mean the end of Doggerland, its remnants were almost completely destroyed after an underwater landslide off the coast of Norway triggered a devastating tsunami.\nAs Vincent Gaffney — an archaeologist from the University of Bradford — said, \"If you were standing on the shoreline on that day, 8,200 years ago, there is no doubt it would have been a bad day for you.\"\nDoggerland's last legs\nBut while this tsunami was long understood to have doomed Doggerland to its watery fate, a 2020 study in the Antiquity journal found that the archipelago stayed above the surface until about 7,000 years ago. That was all the time the fallout from the Ice Age ending needed to finish the job and completely submerge Doggerland.\nGaffney said, \"Ultimately, it was climate change that killed Doggerland.\"\nEven this ending changed the world forever\nAccording to the Smithsonian Magazine, the richness of what was left of Doggerland served as an ideal staging ground for some of the world's first farmers during the Neolithic period.\nAnd since both the hunter-gatherers and the early farmers would have to relocate from Doggerland as it shrank and sunk, they would have resettled in Britain and the Netherlands. As such, 6,000 years of European agriculture can be traced back to the doomed civilization.\nModeling the civilization that was\nBut while archaeologists studying Doggerland have had a wealth of community-sourced artifacts to work with, more recent opportunities have given scientists an idea of what the landscape physically looked like.\nAccording to National Geographic, British and Dutch researchers were able to map 18,000 square miles of pre-flooding Doggerland.\nAn unlikely source\nThese modeling efforts required a wealth of seismic data from widespread surveys of the area, but paleontologists and archaeologists were able to obtain sufficient from an unexpected source.\nAs National Geographic reported, oil companies had to conduct the required thorough surveys to drill in the North Sea effectively. They then made their data available to researchers.\nA new technique\nIn addition to the artifacts acquired by citizens combing the beaches and the modeling afforded by this seismic data, researchers are also searching for any remnants of Doggerland's former residents that still exist under the North Sea.\nAnd as The Jerusalem Post reported, they're using magnetometry to do it.\nWhat is magnetometry?\nMagnetometry involves using ground-penetrating radar systems like this to measure the magnetic fields in a given area.\nOnce the relevant data is gathered, researchers then peruse that data for any anomalies. The hope is that those anomalies will tell them where they can find possible mortal remains.\nAn unorthodox technique\nAs The Jerusalem Post reported, magnetometry is typically used by archaeologists who work on land, as demonstrated by this research team.\nAlthough the current work involving Doggerland won't be the first time scientists have attempted this technique with an undersea landscape, it marks one of only a few times magnetometry has been used this way.\nThe most practical solution\nSince this research covers ground that once made up a significant portion of the North Sea, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to fully comb the area with divers.\nThus, the magnetic field analysis would serve as a way to uncover the same potential leads for remains and artifacts that would otherwise require this hands-on approach.\nTime is also a factor\nMagnetometry is also one of the more time-efficient techniques researchers could use to uncover the data they need, as there's a relatively short window of time for these scientists to work in.\nThat's why archaeologists from the University of Bradford are teaming up with climate scientists and engineers to examine what remains of Doggerland while they can.\nWhat's the rush?\nAccording to The Jerusalem Post, other energy companies are planning to construct offshore wind farms in the North Sea. This initiative is part of the British government's efforts to expand wind power and meet its pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nHowever, these wind farms would also leave significant portions of the North Sea inaccessible to the team investigating Doggerland's final resting place.\nWhat they're hoping to find\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Ph.D. student Ben Urmston explained what would tip the research team off to the possibility they've hit paydirt.\nIn his words, \"Small changes in the magnetic field can indicate changes in the landscape. Such as peat-forming areas and sediments, or where erosion has occurred, for example, in river channels.\"\nThe big hope\nAfter enough of these landscape changes are identified, Urmston is holding out for the possibility that they'll reveal how the land was used when Doggerland was inhabited.\nAs he said, \"As the area we are studying used to be above sea level, there's a small chance this analysis could even reveal evidence for hunter-gatherer activity. That would be the pinnacle.\"\nA little ancient garbology\nAnother feature Urmston is on the lookout for is something the hunter-gatherers who roamed Doggerland may not have taken a second glance at. But to an archaeologist, it might as well be gold.\nIn Urmston's words, \"We might also discover the presence of middens, which are rubbish dumps that consist of animal bone, mollusk shells, and other biological material, that can tell us a lot about how people lived.\"\nA cautionary tale\nBut regardless of what Urmston and other researchers turn up as they examine Doggerland from every angle, the ancient civilization that once stood in its place is a sobering reminder of how destructive climate change can be.\nAfter all, rising sea levels were the main factor that turned the heart of Europe into a forgotten, submerged ruin.",

    "title": "Mass. must do more to keep food waste out of landfills, report says",
    "text": "When you're home cooking a meal, what do you do with the leftover stems from leafy greens, or the rind after squeezing a lemon to add flavor to a dish? What about items on your dinner plate that you didn't eat because you're full or they're just not appetizing? Do you throw the scraps in the garbage? Many of us do, but it's not a good idea, because the result is harmful to the environment. A new report says Massachusetts must do a better job of keeping food waste out of landfills and incinerators, because the result is greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to climate change. “Food waste is a big problem,” said the report’s authors, which include MASSPIRG, Clean Water Action and Frontier Group. One of the biggest problems is methane gas from food scraps dumped in landfills. It's a powerful greenhouse gas and municipal landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions from human activities in the U.S., according to the EPA. In addition, food waste accounts for nearly 25% of solid waste from cities and towns that ends up in landfills. For additional perspective from the EPA, food thrown in the trash causes 58% of methane emissions from municipal solid-waste landfills. The EPA says greenhouse gas emissions from wasted food in the U.S. is equivalent to the same category of emissions from more than 50 million cars that run on gasoline. Worcester, the second-most populous city in New England, has no recorded results in the report for food waste collected, based on surveys done by the state Department of Environmental Protection. The reason for the lack of numbers is that Worcester doesn’t have a citywide food-waste collection program. It’s likely that many residents and businesses put food scraps in the garbage that end up at the WIN Waste Innovations incinerator in Millbury, said Miranda Hotham, Worcester's zero waste coordinator. Not all of Worcester's food scraps end up in the trash, said Hotham, because some homes and businesses hire private companies that pick up the scraps and cart them away for composting. 'Priority' for Worcester Reducing food waste is a “priority” in Worcester, said Hotham. The city expects to have a zero-waste master plan finished in about a year and Hotham said programs to cut food waste will be in the plan. Hotham is studying options to see what works best for Worcester and believes drop off sites, like those in place for yard waste, could be a way to go in the short term. Long term, she envisions a possible curbside food-waste pickup program. Working with the public schools to reduce food waste is another focus for Worcester, said Hotham. More numbers: Goal unmet Discarded foods account for roughly 20% of trash in Massachusetts, with 930,000 tons of food waste sent to landfills and incinerators yearly, said the report. Massachusetts has goals to cut food waste but missed the mark, according to the report. The state fell 20% short of its goal to cut 450,000 tons of food waste from disposal by 2020. Massachusetts has another goal: cutting 780,000 tons of food waste disposal by 2030. To get there, the report said certain steps must be taken. One is to follow the lead of Vermont and California, which ban the disposal of food waste in landfills. Also, divert all food scraps from disposal, invest in systems to make that possible and set programs to prevent food waste. Many foods shouldn't be thrown out, because they remain nutritious and healthy and can feed the hungry. Composting is key Another recommendation is to focus more on composting and less on anaerobic digestion. Composting uses oxygen to break down organic matter to make fertilizer, while anaerobic digestion doesn’t. State financial incentives largely drove a fourfold increase in the amount of food waste sent to anaerobic digesters from 2016 to 2022, said the report. However, there’s a public health downside to anaerobic digestion, according to the study. Food waste sent to sewage treatment plants for anaerobic digestion results in biosolids sold as fertilizer that may be contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS. The chemicals are linked to a range of health risks including cancer. To reduce the risks, the report said, Massachusetts should cut the amount of food waste that goes to sewage treatment plants, take steps to ensure the purity of food waste sent to composting operations and adopt standards for PFAS and other contaminants in biosolids. Hotham noted she is studying other cities that use anaerobic digestion and some of their methods could be adopted in Worcester. While noting she isn't well-versed on the chemical process of anaerobic digestion, Hotham said composting could be a better option for Worcester. Send money to cities/towns Massachusetts also needs to invest more resources in cities and towns so they can create programs to collect food scraps and increase public participation in existing programs, said the report. In addition, it’s important to tackle the top of the waste stream, the report said. That means instead of throwing out healthy foods, develop channels to get them to families in need. Another consideration is cost. It’s less expensive to send food scraps to composting and anaerobic digesting facilities instead of landfills, the study said. That’s because Massachusetts cities and towns pay more, on average, than any state in the U.S. to deposit trash in landfills. Known as tipping fees, Massachusetts pays $122.63 per ton, according to Waste Business Journal . Rounding out the top five most expensive tipping-fee states are Minnesota ($119.69), Vermont ($116.46), Rhode Island ($100.20) and Washington ($100.08). Worcester paid $77.78 per ton as of Jan. 1. There is another financial consideration. Reducing food waste saves money when considering the cost of growing, processing and transporting foods from the farm to the dinner table. The average family of four in the U.S. throws out $1,500 of food yearly, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Commitment to 2030 goal The state Department of Environmental Protection is reviewing the report’s recommendations, said an agency spokeswoman. “The Healey-Driscoll administration is committed to accelerating our efforts to support and expand these initiatives,” said the agency’s prepared statement, adding it’s committed to achieving the 2030 goal of cutting 780,000 tons of food waste. Over a six-year period from 2016 to 2022, the state cut the amount of food waste sent to landfills and incinerators by 47%, from 360,000 tons to 190,000 tons yearly, according to the report. Massachusetts is also processing roughly 600,000 tons of organic waste yearly through anaerobic digestion. Meanwhile, 89 of the state’s 351 cities and towns had some type of food waste collection system in 2023, representing more than half a million homes. That compares to 24 communities in 2014. Other accomplishments, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection, include a 56% jump in the number of businesses statewide that have food-waste diversion programs. Today, the number is 3,100, compared to 1,350 in 2014. Also, enforcement of the state’s ban on commercial food waste resulted in 129 infraction notices and 14 court orders since 2022. The ban, established in October 2014, prohibited businesses that generate a minimum of one ton weekly of food waste from throwing the scraps in the garbage. Instead, businesses must arrange alternatives including donation, composting and anaerobic digestion. The state toughened the ban in November 2022, setting the minimum weekly threshold at a half ton or more of food waste.

    "title": "Pokémon Go Rowlet Community Day guide",
    "text": "[Pokémon Go](https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713) is having a Rowlet Community Day event on Jan. 6 from 2-5 p.m. in your local time. As expected with a Community Day event, Rowlet will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below. How do I catch a shiny Rowlet ? As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon)), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon. If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an Incense, then quickly tap each Rowlet to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Rowlet you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked. What Community Day move does Rowlet’s evolution learn? If you evolve Dartrix into Decidueye from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move Frenzy Plant. If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Frenzy Plant. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an [Elite TM](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines) to get the move. How does Decidueye do in the meta? Decidueye with Frenzy Plant is a pretty good PvE (raids and gyms) attacker, though it falls behind the big picks like Kartana and Roserade. If you don’t have a team of Shadow grass-types or Kartana, Decidueye works pretty well. In PvP, most experts have worked out that it’s not going to replace Trevenant (which has the same grass- and ghost-typing), but it will be playable with Spirit Shackle and Frenzy Plant. How do I make the most of Rowlet Community Day? The following bonuses will be active during Rowlet Community Day: - Tripled Stardust for catching Pokémon - Doubled candy for catching Pokémon - Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon - Incense lasts three hours - Lure Modules lasts three hours - Rowlet special photobombs when taking snapshots - One additional special trade - Stardust cost halved for trading That said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Rowlet. It’s worth mentioning that any Rowlet Candy you get will still work on Hisuian Decidueye, which isn’t available yet, but will be later in the season. So if you plan on powering up a Hisuian Decidueye, don’t use all your freshly obtained candy during this event. If you can [Mega Evolve](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids) Venusaur, Charizard, Pidgeot, Pinsir, Aerodactyl, Sceptile, Salamence, Groudon, Rayquaza, or Abomasnow, you’ll score additional Rowlet Candy per catch. In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Dartrix raid, Rowlet will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Rowlet you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.",
