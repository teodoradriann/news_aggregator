    "title": "“WWE is calling,” Fans take a dig at losing welterweight contender Colby Covington’s political aspirations as a WWE-esque role of not fulfilling promises",
    "text": "Welterweight Colby Covington flunked big on his title contention at UFC 296. Going up against the reigning titleholder Leon Edwards, the 17-4 ‘Chaos’ lost in way of a unanimous decision. However, the fighter later contended the notion, attesting on having\nwon the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds against ‘Rocky.’ Now, reeling from the aftermath the fighter has let loose his political aspirations. Fans have consequently called him out on not keeping his promises.\nThis marks the fighter’s 3rd title fight loss in the division, despite talking a big game. Going up against former champion and pound-for-pound king\nKamaru Usman, Covington had lost twice. These title skids came at UFC 245 and UFC 268. The fighter has been doing social media rounds explaining his crack-ups. Speaking to Patrick Bet-David (and co-hosts Adam Sosnick and Vincent Oshana) for the PBD Podcast episode 343, he said:\nI do believe I’m the Donald Trump of the UFC...He’s my biggest role model, he’s my mentor, and he’s someone that I really look up to, so I try and model my career after a lot of things that he’s done...I definitely would like to run for Congress in a few years, I think I’d be the perfect fighter. I’m not a guy that’s going to sell out to the establishment. I’m a self-made man from nothing...Colby Covington on Patrick Bet-David’s podcast\nCovington nudged in on following in the footsteps of his close acquaintance and idol, Republic Party Nominee Donald Trump. The 45th Ex-President was in attendance at the UFC 296 headliner. However, his\nabandoning Covington’s ‘MAGA’ speech for selectively including him after an embarrassing defeat had garnered many reactions.\nA prime reaction to his political striving led to a fan saying “Nah WWE is calling“. This is a running gag alluding to his WWE-esque pretense of putting on a show, despite the output. Even the feuding Sean Strickland had recently called him a “WWE Actor“.\n“Get into Congress, maybe Senate,” Colby Covington aims to follow Donald Trump into Politics after MMA retirement\nFans react to Colby Covington’s schemes for political endeavors\nDespite a recent loss, Colby “Chaos” Covington cannot help but be chaotic, true to his moniker. Now he has riled up fans with political purports in mind. Recently he let loose his aspirations to run for Congress or the Governor of Florida. This was during a segment with the PBD podcast, where he attributed his loss to a\nrecent foot break injury.\nThe loss in question was to Leon Edwards at UFC 296. In the build-up to the title bout, Covington had ravaged the reputation of Edwards’ deceased father, to hype up the fight. Conversely, he later hinted at “playing a part”; a stint not unlike him. Check out how fans have now responded to him playing the part of a politician, in the below tweets.\nA handful of fans have alluded to close friend Donald Trump walking out early on his performance at the last headliner. Even those who have not been overtly critical of the fighter have veered off his political designs.\nIn case you missed it:\nAfter devastating loss to Leon Edwards, Colby Covington claims ‘trainwreck’ Sean Strickland is ‘easy fight’ “It absolutely works,” UFC star Colby Covington DOUBLES DOWN on his trash talking game to Tucker Carlson despite recent controversy Gerard Crispin",

    "text": "Photo Taken In London, United Kingdom\nPuede que estemos en los primeros días de la primavera, pero el viernes por la mañana podría sentirse francamente invernal a lo largo de la frontera entre Wisconsin e Illinois, con fuertes nevadas que amenazan con entorpecer el viaje de miles de residentes.\nSegún el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, se han emitido advertencias de tiempo invernal para la mayor parte del sur de Wisconsin, incluido el condado de Kenosha, y partes del norte de Illinois, incluidos el condado de McHenry y el condado de Lake.\nSe espera que esa advertencia dure toda la mañana del viernes y hasta las primeras horas de la tarde, lo que generará posibles dolores de cabeza al viajar en toda la región.\nSegún la advertencia, “viajar podría ser muy difícil” en el sur de Wisconsin, con entre cuatro y seis pulgadas de nieve posibles en un área que incluye Madison, Milwaukee y Kenosha.\nLas áreas a lo largo de la frontera en Illinois podrían ver entre uno y cinco pulgadas de nieve, pero existe cierta preocupación de que la banda más pesada de nieve pueda desplazarse hacia el sur, ampliando el impacto potencial del sistema, según los funcionarios.\nLa principal preocupación sigue siendo el viaje matutino del viernes, ya que las fuertes nevadas podrían provocar condiciones de viaje lentas y descuidadas durante ese período.\nEn áreas entre la I-90 y la I-80, existe la posibilidad de que caiga nieve, pero también es posible que haya precipitaciones y lluvias mixtas en esas regiones. La lluvia afectará principalmente a las áreas a lo largo y al sur de la Interestatal 80 antes de que el sistema clipper atraviese el área, según los modelos de pronóstico.\nOtro sistema avanzará hasta el lunes, trayendo lluvia y viento a la región antes de que las cosas comiencen a aclararse el miércoles.\nEstén atentos a la aplicación NBC Chicago y al NBC 5 Storm Team para conocer los últimos acontecimientos e información meteorológica.",

    "title": "Ethereum Layer 2 Valuation Projected to Surpass Trillions by Wall Street's VanEck: Implications for DOUX | FinancialContent Business Page",
    "text": "In recent times, the Ethereum ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable surge in the proliferation of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. According to the latest data from L2beat, an astonishing 47 online L2 solutions are currently operational, with an additional 35 poised for imminent launch. Moreover, 11 Layer 3 (L3) solutions are in active development. Presently, the average transactions per second (TPS) on L2 networks exceed that of the Ethereum main net by an impressive factor of 11.33.\nIn the midst of this flourishing landscape of L2 advancements, attention naturally turns to the potential trajectory of DOUX. As an active participant in this dynamic ecosystem, DOUX's evolution and contributions hold significant promise for shaping the future landscape of Ethereum's scalability solutions over the next 1-2 years.\nValuation of L2 Predicted to Reach Trillions, Thousands of Rollups Expected by 2024\nA recent report from VanEck forecasts a monumental milestone for Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks, predicting their valuation to potentially surpass 1 trillion US dollars by 2024. Within this projection, thousands of Rollups, including DOUX, are anticipated to play a pivotal role. Positioned as a standout among Rollups, DOUX is primed to leverage its innovative features and strategic positioning to drive substantial growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nVanEck's valuation methodology involves applying the Free Cash Flow (FCF) terminal multiple to the expected future cash flows. This predictive process encompasses several key steps, including analyzing the overall potential market size (TAM) of public chains, predicting Ethereum's market share on these chains, and estimating the total value of Miner Extractable Value (MEV).\nVanEck Evaluates Five Key Areas of L2 In its analysis of L2, VanEck states that they use the following five main variables to measure its potential success or failure:\nTransaction costs: The cost of transactions for users on the L2 network is a key factor in attracting users. Differences in transaction costs stem from factors such as data compression, scale, proof costs, and profit margins. Developer experience: For L2 networks, compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is crucial, ensuring the seamless porting of smart contracts and tools from Ethereum. User experience: The convenience of asset entry and withdrawal processes is the foundation of a good user experience. Trust assumptions: Building trust around data availability on L2 and measures to prevent vulnerabilities and hacker attacks. Ecosystem scale: The strength of an L2 network's ecosystem significantly impacts its value. TVL (Total Value Locked) on L2 indicates participation, as it demonstrates the funds invested in the ecosystem to capture opportunities.\nAmidst Fierce Competition, VanEck Expresses Caution\nDespite the optimistic outlook for L2 networks, VanEck expects intense competition among them and expresses caution regarding the long-term value prospects of most L2 tokens. They highlight the challenges of absorbing the influx of new supply into the cryptocurrency market and the potential for significant discounts accompanying it.\n“The fully diluted value (FDV) of the seven major L2 tokens has accumulated to $40 billion, and more strong projects are expected to launch in the future. This suggests that the market may see inflows of up to $100 billion in the next 12 to 18 months.”\n“For the cryptocurrency market, even digesting a small portion of this new supply will pose significant challenges, let alone the possibility of significant discounts that may accompany it.”\nVanEck delves into the prospective role of DOUX within the evolving realm of Ethereum's Layer 2 scaling solutions. While acknowledging the potential value of certain L2 tokens in the future, VanEck emphasizes the complexity of predicting their trajectory, particularly since L2 tokens are not presently utilized for gas fee payments within their respective ecosystems.\nEnvisioning a dynamic future landscape, VanEck anticipates the proliferation of thousands of Rollups, including those tailored for specific applications or industries, alongside dominant generic L2 solutions. Within this intricate ecosystem, DOUX emerges as a compelling contender, poised to carve out its niche and contribute significantly to the broader adoption and advancement of Layer 2 scaling technologies within the Ethereum network.\nMedia contact :\nContact name: Laine Burke\nLocation city state: USA\nEmail: info@douxcrypto.xyz\nWebsite URL: https://douxcrypto.xyz\nCompany name: DOUX",

    "title": "Los riesgos de la corrección emocional: la salud mental infantil requiere tiempo y presencia, no soluciones exprés - Infobae",
    "text": "La salud mental infantil no es obediencia emocional, sino la posibilidad de transitar el dolor acompañado por una presencia disponible (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Vivimos tiempos donde el sufrimiento debe ser editado. En los canales de YouTube, niños sonrientes encarnan una felicidad estridente, producida como contenido. Años más tarde, algunos de esos mismos niños, ya adultos, narran la otra cara: explotación, abandono, escenas de su infancia convertidas en mercancía.\nEsa narrativa se replica como una epidemia emocional . Niñez feliz, sin trauma ni sombras. Y en el otro extremo, niñez reducida al dolor crudo, expuesta sin contención, sin contexto.\nTodo entra en escena: lo invisible del trauma y lo obsceno del espectáculo . Nuestra época oscila entre dos polos igualmente violentos: silenciar el dolor infantil o exhibirlo sin marco , como si fuera material de consumo. En ambos casos, el sufrimiento se descontextualiza y, por tanto, no puede alojarse. Se convierte en mercancía emocional : o se tapa, o se muestra. Pero en ninguno de los dos lugares se escucha.\nFrente a esto, urge una ética del cuidado que recupere el lugar del adulto como garante, no como espectador ni editor de las emociones infantiles. Ser adulto no es controlar lo que el niño siente, sino acompañar, sostener, ofrecer un marco donde el sufrimiento pueda desplegarse sin ser corregido.\nLa docuserie Malas influencias muestra ese reverso brutal de las redes sociales: allí donde se viralizan sonrisas de infancia, también se encubren contratos abusivos, silencios extorsivos y un dolor que se maquilla para ser presentable.\nEn redes sociales, la niñez se convierte en contenido, con sonrisas virales que ocultan contratos abusivos y silencios extorsivos Hoy, el sufrimiento incomoda. Se lo interpreta como falla , como exceso, como algo que debe resolverse rápido . Se premia la euforia forzada, se cancela lo que incomoda. Incluso el dolor debe mostrarse con buena cara.\nEste mandato de corrección emocional se vuelve más cruel con las infancias. Si un niño se angustia, debe calmarse. Si una niña revive una escena traumática, debe superarla. Si un adolescente está triste, debe gestionarse. Y debe respirar. Respirar : ese acto vital se volvió consigna de autocontrol, fórmula de corrección afectiva. No sientas. O, si sentís, que sea rápido, limpio, funcional.\nEn nombre de la salud mental , se patologiza el sufrimiento infantil. Se lo medicaliza . Se lo diagnostica. Pero muchas veces no hay enfermedad: hay trauma, hay duelo, hay miedo . Hay una experiencia que aún no encuentra palabras. Y esas experiencias no necesitan corrección inmediata. Necesitan tiempo.\nTiempo para alojarlas. Para comenzar a inscribirlas en una trama que les otorgue sentido. Porque el dolor no desaparece con maquillaje. Solo se transforma cuando puede hablarse , cuando otro escucha sin interrumpir ni traducir antes de tiempo.\nEl sufrimiento infantil suele ser silenciado o expuesto sin contexto, en ambos casos queda despojado de sentido y sin posibilidad de ser alojado (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El problema no es buscar ayuda. El problema es cuando esa ayuda no escucha, sino que silencia. Cuando ante el llanto se responde con un diagnóstico. Cuando ante la angustia se ofrece una técnica. Cuando todo debe corregirse rápido para volver a funcionar.\nAsí aparecen terapias exprés , promesas de alivio inmediato, gurús emocionales que ofrecen calma sin elaboración. Todo se convierte en técnica, en receta, en estrategia. Pero lo que no se elabora, no se va: se convierte en síntoma . El cuerpo guarda lo que el lenguaje no puede tramitar . Y eso retorna.\nEn este paisaje, lo psíquico queda disociado del cuerpo, del tiempo, del vínculo. Se habla de “salud mental” como si fuera un estado estable, alcanzable, medible. Pero no lo es. La salud mental no es un ideal, es un proceso . Una construcción subjetiva, relacional, siempre inacabada.\nY cuando hay trauma —verdadero trauma— no hay recursos rápidos. Porque lo traumático, por definición, desborda. Irrumpe. No encuentra palabra ni marco. Solo comienza a transformarse cuando otro escucha, cuando puede ser alojado.\nSe patologiza el dolor infantil cuando no hay enfermedad, hay trauma, duelo o miedo que aún no encuentran palabras ni espacios para alojarse (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) A veces, lo que un niño necesita no es una técnica ni una consigna. Necesita tiempo. Necesita una presencia que no interrumpa, que no traduzca, que no lo apure. Tal vez, el mayor acto terapéutico sea ese: estar, sin corregir.\nVolver a lo tangible es reconocer que lo psíquico necesita cuerpo, palabra, otros que sostengan. Que no todo se resuelve con campañas ni contenidos. Que a veces lo más urgente es lo más básico: una voz que escucha, una presencia que no juzga, un espacio donde el sufrimiento pueda ser reconocido como parte de lo humano.\nLa salud mental no es una promesa de felicidad. Ni mucho menos una corrección estética del dolor. Lo que no se elabora, deja huella . Lo que se maquilla sin procesar, se enquista.\nUn niño debe sentirse querido, cuidado y respetado (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) La salud mental infantojuvenil no es ausencia de conflicto ni obediencia emocional. No es un niño calmo ni un adolescente funcional. Es la posibilidad de transitar el dolor acompañado. De tener tiempo, palabras y vínculos.\nQuizás haya que recordarlo con la precisión de Freud: una persona sana es aquella que puede amar y trabajar.\nQue un niño pueda sentirse querido, cuidado, respetado. Que no tenga que esconder lo que le duele para ser aceptado. Eso es lo esencial.\n* Sonia Almada: es Lic. en Psicología de la Universidad de Buenos Aires.
