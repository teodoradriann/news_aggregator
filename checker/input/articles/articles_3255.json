    "text": "Malgré des progrès en efficacité énergétique, l'empreinte écologique de l'IA devient hors de contrôle. Consommation croissante de l'électricité et de l'eau, dépendances aux énergies carbonées : comment limiter la catastrophe ? Peut-on continuer d'augmenter les performances de l'intelligence artificielle sans menacer notre planète ? Ces dernières semaines, des signaux d'alerte se sont multipliés. OpenAI, le créateur de ChatGPT, a récemment averti la Maison Blanche que chacun de ses futurs data centers nécessiterait probablement « plus d'énergie que celle utilisée pour alimenter une ville entière ».\nLe même mois, l'énergéticien Constellation Energy et Microsoft signaient un accord de 20 ans pour la réouverture de la centrale nucléaire de Three Mile Island en Pennsylvanie, site de l'accident radiologique le plus grave qu'aient connu les États-Unis. De son côté, Google a admis qu'il peinait à atteindre ses objectifs de neutralité carbone.\nLire aussi« Utiliser l'IA est une question de vie ou de mort pour une entreprise » (Emilie Sidiqian, directrice France de Salesforce)\nLa tendance se généralise aux États-Unis, où sont développés la plupart des grands modèles d'IA générative. À tel point qu'un rapport de BloombergNEF met en garde contre le ralentissement des progrès du pays en matière de décarbonisation. Les émissions ne seraient réduites que de 34 % d'ici à 2030 par rapport à leurs niveaux de 2005, très loin de l'objectif de 50 à 52 %. En cause selon ce rapport : la boulimie de l'IA en matière d'énergie.\nUne démocratisation à marche forcée\n« Tous les géants du Web investissent dans des infrastructures, privilégiant la performance des modèles, et négligeant le coût énergétique », résume Tristan Nitot, directeur associé chez OCTO Technology, spécialiste du numérique durable. Il y a quelques semaines, Éric Schmidt, ex-patron de Google et investisseur majeur dans l'IA, balayait le sujet d'un revers de main lors d'une conférence. « Nous n'atteindrons pas les objectifs quoiqu'il arrive parce que nous ne sommes pas organisés pour.

    "text": "A pro-Palestine protester was captured this weekend praising North Korea for supporting Palestine and stating how history shows a “ceasefire is not enough,” video shows.\nIn a video posted to X (formerly known as Twitter) by citizen journalist Stu, a pro-Palestine protester is seen giving what appears to be an alleged history lesson in how North Korea’s timeline is similar to Palestine’s. A first clip posted by the citizen journalist opens up on the girl sitting in a folding camp chair wearing both a mask and hat. While looking down occasionally at what appears to be her notes, the girl states that Korea’s history shows the activists must “go beyond a ceasefire” in order for the Palestinians to have “liberation.” (RELATED: Massive American Flag Unveiled Over George Washington University Pro-Palestine Encampment)\n“That war with North Korea, making it the longest running war in the world. And this is also proof that our current movement for Palestine cannot stop at a ceasefire, like Korea shows us ceasefire is not enough. The U.S. is still at war with North Korea. And so we see that like in both of these situations, we have to go beyond ceasefire for the liberation of the people —” the girl states before the video cuts out.\nHere are some more clips of our favorite North Korean Apologist.\nDid you know that the United States is at war with North Korea?\nThis Nodutdol activist thinks we need to go “beyond ceasefire for the liberation of the people.” That means we need to embrace Communism. pic.twitter.com/T0jJ4ZfZkt\n— Stu (@thestustustudio) May 5, 2024\nA second clip continues to show the activist moving in Korea’s historical timeline before asking other protesters listening, which “side” in Korea they believe supports Palestine.\n“So now moving from like the Korean War in South Korea, now we’re post Korea war and unfortunately, the peninsula is divided. But now like what’s going on in North Korea and how does that relate to Palestine? So, for — okay, so which side do you ya’ll think North Korea supports Palestine or Israel? Just guess,” the female protester states.\n“Palestine,” an activist off camera could be heard stating.\nThis is the clip that went viral. I trimmed it down so she got to the point quicker. Here is the full version. pic.twitter.com/lbP2quD5Zn\n— Stu (@thestustustudio) May 5, 2024\n“It is Palestine. The DKRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] has actually never recognized the State of Israel. They have always upheld the right of Palestinian people to self determination and resistance. This is beyond moral and rhetorical support. The DKRK has actively armed and trained Palestinian resistance for decades. That includes the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization], the PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], and the DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine] have trained troops by the DPRK. So while the U.S. is here, training the IOF [Israel Offensive Forces] with police. North Korea is training Palestinian [groups],” the protester responds.\nThe protester carries on by discussing the “imperial and colonial powers” that allegedly had to “preserve their world orders,” claiming that both Israel and South Korea are “outflows of imperialism.”\n“The imperial and colonial powers had to colonize Palestine and divide Korea in order to preserve their world order. So, this is how we can clearly see like even today that both Israel and South Korea are outflows of imperialism. They’re client states and foothold for imperial powers to maintain their power and influence in those regions. And this means also that between Koreans and Palestinians like of course, there’s this shared history of violence and repression. But more than that, with a common oppressor, we have a shared struggle and we have a shared history of resistance. That is like what most deeply connects Koreans, with Palestinians and with the Palestinian struggle,” the protester stated.\nJust like Palestine, Korea has been at war with imperial powers.\n“Between Koreans and Palestinians like of course there’s this shared history of violence and repression, but more than that with a common oppressor, we have a shared struggle and we have a shared history of… pic.twitter.com/SCp2yFCW4H\n— Stu (@thestustustudio) May 5, 2024\nWhile it is unclear where the protester was at and who she was speaking to, activists have increased in gathering over the last month, specifically on school campuses across the U.S. As some students claimed to be demanding that schools divest their funds from companies connected to Israel ties, demonstrations in some areas have turned in clashes between protesters and activists.\nLast week activists on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus built an encampment on the school grounds. While tensions heightened after pro-Israeli counter protesters confronted the group, authorities didn’t make arrests or tear down the site until nearly two days later, which left the grounds with an array of trash and graffiti. Clashes also occurred at Columbia University last week after New York police officials raided a school building after a handful of protesters had taken over.",

    "text": "By Marc Jones\nLONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Arsenal spurned the opportunity to retake first place in the Premier League as they lost 2-0 to fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates on Thursday.\nWest Ham only had three efforts on target but Tomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break.\nArsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely.\nWest Ham took the lead against the run of play after 13 minutes when Soucek knocked home after a pull-back from Jarrod Bowen who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play.\nAfter that it was an Arsenal blitz with Bukayo Saka crashing the ball against the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good opportunities before Mavropanos scored with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but Said Benrahma had a penalty saved in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind Liverpool who beat Burnley 2-0 on Tuesday.\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n(( ; +44 (0)20 7513 4042; Reuters Messaging:\n[marc.jones.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net](rm://marc.jones.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net) Twitter @marcjonesrtrs))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Professor Richard Susskind said we were just a couple of years away from having “our own AI systems that will be our personal assistants, that will be our personal tutors, that will be our personal researchers, our personal physicians, our personal legal advisers”.\nBut sometimes grand claims about the potential of AI in education can be hard to believe when far more modest aims - such as giving all pupils a device and internet connection - continue to elude us.\nThat promise was made in the SNP’s 2021 Scottish Parliament election manifesto, but never delivered. Last September Tes Scotland revealed that 10 of Scotland’s 32 local authorities had policies - at various stages - to provide all or many pupils with their own device, but 22 did not.\nNine months on, the landscape is unlikely to be much different.\nSchools’ unreliable internet connections Meanwhile, national bodies such as the SQA report limping along with “an ageing digital infrastructure” that dates back to the 1990s and is no longer fit for purpose. The message coming out of many schools is similar: unreliable internet connections continue to thwart staff .\nWho, therefore, is going to spearhead this AI revolution? Who is putting in place the infrastructure? And how is it going to be funded?\nMore likely than the system as a whole exploiting AI is that some do and some don’t, and more gaps open up: gaps between pupils who can afford their own devices (and have the knowhow to tap into the potential of the technology) and those who cannot; gaps between the councils - and the schools - where devices are provided, or not.\nUltimately, while technological change is indeed fast and furious, the same cannot be said of change in Scottish education, where the theme of the past year and more has been for it to be constantly called for, considered and debated - but seldom enacted.\nThe upshot is that the same items remain on the to-do list in perpetuity.\nThis is illustrated by Tes Scotland articles that bookended this school year. Back in August 2024, as the 2024-25 school year got under way, we were writing about the behaviour crisis. The education secretary, Jenny Gilruth, had published her behaviour “action plan” to muted enthusiasm; just last week, guidance on consequences was published to much the same lacklustre response. Both documents provoked calls for more resources, rather than carefully chosen words.\nIn August 2024, exam results were also making headlines; then, last month, students completed the latest batch of National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams with little sense significant change is in the offing, even though less of a reliance on exams and the use of a wider range of assessment methods was a key recommendation of the independent review.\nThe secondary teacher shortage was also an issue in August 2024 (as illustrated by our exclusive story looking at the number of probationers requested by councils, as compared with the number they received). Fast-forward to June 2025 and research by School Leaders Scotland found that over a third of schools had adjusted their curricula because they could not get certain subject specialists, from craft, design and technology teachers to maths teachers.\nThe financial woes of independent schools were also hitting the headlines in August 2024. Arguably, that story has moved on, although not in a way the sector will welcome. Earlier this month, independent schools lost their court battle over the introduction of VAT on fees .\nA rare ‘green shoot’ In this somewhat stale and static landscape - albeit education reform reached a landmark in the Scottish Parliament this week - the Curriculum Improvement Cycle , which got under way in earnest this academic year, has been described on several occasions as a rare “green shoot”.\nBaked into the review process seems to be how change will happen. Unlike other reviews, the CIC isn’t just about figuring out what is wrong with Curriculum for Excellence and coming up with solutions; the assumption is that deficiencies, once identified, will then be addressed.\nSome headteachers complain that the 10-year period the review will span is too long, that too many children will have to make do with a curriculum we know is far from ideal, where the knowledge that should be learned at each age and stage is ill-defined, and where teachers cover excessive amounts of content at the expense of deeper learning.\nBut in a stretched system where money is tight and capacity low, is iterative change over a long period perhaps the only way to make progress?\nLooking ahead to the election This kind of long-term view is unusual; the five-year electoral cycle encourages short-termism. And now, with all eyes on the 2026 Scottish Parliament election next May, the SNP government is likely to become ever more cautious as it seeks to avoid any missteps it could pay the price for at the ballot box.\nThis desire to avoid controversy will likely be exploited by the teaching unions when it comes to pay - but also class-contact time.\nIt might seem as though the promise to reduce the time teachers spend in class by 90 minutes a week is dead in the water, given it was made more than four years ago, ahead of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.\nCome August, however, the results of the consultative ballots being run by the EIS and SSTA teaching unions over industrial action will be in - and the last thing the government will want ahead of the election is striking teachers and closed schools.\nOne change that may yet come to fruition, then, is more preparation and planning time for teachers.\nThis could provide a welcome bit of extra breathing space for school staff - at least until the robots take over…\nEmma Seith is senior reporter at Tes Scotland.
