    "text": "ANNAPOLIS, Mo. — South Iron R-1 Schools and a number of homes are badly damaged after an EF-1 tornado tore through parts of Iron County, Missouri. One survivor says he still can't believe he's alive. \"It was scary,” custodian Kenny Berkbuegler said. “It was something I don't ever want to witness again.\" Wednesday evening custodian Kenny Berkbuegler was preparing South Iron High School for the final day of class when severe weather struck. “I really didn’t think we were going to get much of anything last night,” Berkbuegler said. “It was getting later in the evening. This kind of all just popped up and it all happened so fast. We had seconds to react all I could do is run.\" Berkbuegler took shelter in a staff bathroom as a tornado slammed into the school. \"Time stood still,” said Berkbuegler. “It was very quick, but it felt like an eternity. It was pretty scary.\" The tornado, with windspeeds of up to 110mph badly damaged the school, as it traveled roughly 6 miles through the Annapolis area. “We really didn’t see anything bad at the time,” District Fire Chief Byron Ashlock said. “There was no tornado signatures, no tornado warnings, and as the storm moved on top of us it was just immediate. There was no warning and no time to set the sirens off.” In the moment Berkbuegler said he was just happy to be alive. \"When I came up here this morning and seen what everything looked like, and it still is, it's hard to comprehend that I was right here,” Berkbuegler said. “The true blessing is that nobody was hurt,” Annapolis Mayor Scott Oheman said. As damage surveys continue, outgoing South Iron Superintendent Cristie Ayres says schools across the region have reached out offering their support. Still, it’s unclear if the school will be repaired in time for the start of the fall semester. “We’re hoping,” South Iron Superintendent Cristie Ayres said. “We have no idea what that’s going to look like. Of course, when we go inside and look at that, three months, that’s a lot to get accomplished in three months.” “This is definitely not the way I wanted the school year to end,” Berkbuegler said.",

The comedy, which costars Will Ferrell, is available to stream on Prime Video starting on Jan. 30.\nWitherspoon selected a sultry skirt suit consisting of a cropped blazer and a pencil skirt featuring a thigh-high slit. She also added on black pumps, completing her look with diamond dangle earrings.\nThe actress currently works with stylist Petra Flannery, who also counts Amy Adams and Emma Stone as clients.\nWitherspoon wore her blond tresses straightened, while her makeup consisted of bronze eye shadow and nude lip liner.\nYou May Also Like\nThe “Legally Blonde” star posed on the red carpet with Ferrell, who wore a slate gray suit.\nWitherspoon evoked her character from the 2001 film in October while speaking at Hello Sunshine’s Shine Away event in Los Angeles, modeling a Carolina Herrera dress in Elle Woods’ signature hue: pink.\nThe actress selected a flared midi silhouette from the label’s resort 2025 collection, which features button embellishments and a thin belt. She added on small gold hoops, completing her look with metallic cap-toe slingbacks.\nOther guests at Hello Sunshine’s second annual event included actresses Laura Dern and Octavia Spencer, the former of which costarred with Witherspoon in HBO’s “Big Little Lies.”\nWitherspoon is searching for the next Elle Woods, as a prequel series to “Legally Blonde” is currently in pre-production. An open casting call was announced by the actress on Instagram last spring.\n“Before she became the most famous Gemini vegetarian to graduate from Harvard Law, she was just a regular ‘90s high school girl,” she wrote of the show’s premise. “And all of you are going to get to know her, next year on @primevideo I’m so excited!”\n“Elle” will be produced by Witherspoon’s own production company, Hello Sunshine, which she founded in 2016.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The White House Correspondents’ Association said on Thursday CNN has rejected multiple requests to include White House pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump.\nThe press pool, made up of representatives of major news organizations, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed.\nIt is extremely rare for them to be barred from an event in the United States.\n“WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,” Kelly O’Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said in a statement.\n“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the unexpected does happen,” she said, and to provide “context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.”\nThese reporters are there to see what is said and done when the microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation, she wrote, with duties “separate from the production of the debate as a news event.”\nO’Donnell said both the Biden and Trump campaign agreed to the WHCA’s request.\nCNN has only agreed to allow one White House print pool reporter to enter the studio during a commercial break to “briefly observe the setting.”\nThe network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television feed of the debate to other networks.\nCNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network did not respond to a request for comment.\n“Precedent matters for future debates,” O’Donnell said, alluding to Biden and Trump’s face off again in September.\nThe National Association of Black Journalists has also asked CNN to accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none of Atlanta’s Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the debate.\n(This story has been refiled to fix the spelling of Kelly O’Donnell’s surname in paragraphs 7 and 11)\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose and Steve Holland; Editing by David Gregorio)",

    "text": "Tomb Raider Studio Crystal Dynamics Has Suffered a Round of Layoffs\nThursday, March 27, 2025\nCrystal Dynamics, the developer behind the modern Tomb Raider series (from Tomb Raider Legend onward) has announced layoffs, in what it calls a “difficult decision”.\nAccording to the developer, seventeen “talented team members” have been let go, although it's not clear which teams have been affected by the layoffs. Currently, Crystal Dynamics is working on the Perfect Dark reboot alongside Xbox studio The Initiative, as well as a new Tomb Raider instalment, rumoured to be a fully open-world affair set in India.\n“This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly,” the developer writes in a statement. “Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.”\nThe studio notes that it's supporting employees impacted by the layoffs with “transition packages and opportunity outreach,” and affirms its commitment to “pushing the boundaries of making great games,” adding: “This change does not alter our current project plans.”\nMeanwhile, it's been more than six years since we last saw Lara Croft in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, so perhaps it's high time we saw the intrepid explorer's long-awaited return.",

    "text": "Duas dezenas de pais manifestaram-se hoje junto ao Agrupamento de Escolas Vale do Tamel, em Barcelos, contra a decisão do diretor de não permitir a renovação de matrícula no 12.º ano de dois alunos com autismo.\nEm causa estão alunos com 18 e 19 anos que, por falta de respostas sociais na região, vão ter de ficar em casa a partir de agora e, como não podem ficar sozinhos, um dos progenitores vai ter de deixar o trabalho para cuidar deles.\n\"É de lamentar a enorme falta de sensibilidade do diretor do agrupamento, que, ainda por cima, é professor de Religião e Moral\", disse Sofia Cruz, mãe do aluno com 19 anos.\nSofia Cruz disse que o filho está há cinco anos inscrito para uma vaga de num centro de atividades e capacitação para a inclusão (CACI).\n\"Contava que a escola deixasse o meu filho ficar mais um ano, mas o diretor disse-me que não há a mínima hipótese, que a escola não é a resposta para estas situações e que não quer abrir precedentes. Mas a verdade é que já houve um precedente\", referiu.\nO porta-voz do movimento Pais em Luta, Jorge Castro, sublinhou que a decisão do diretor é \"discriminatória\", já que, numa escola do concelho vizinho de Esposende, alunos nas mesmas circunstâncias conseguiram que lhes fosse garantida a renovação de matrícula no 12.º ano, já pela quarta vez consecutiva.\n\"Os nossos filhos não são 'precedentes', são seres humanos com necessidades especiais, e os recursos aparecem quando a necessidade assim o exige\", apontou.\nEm 12 de junho, os pais de crianças e jovens manifestaram-se frente à Segurança Social de Braga contra a falta de vagas em CACI na região.\nJorge Castro entrou mesmo em greve de fome, um protesto que acabaria por terminar já à noite, depois de o Instituto da Segurança Social ter deixado a garantia de criação de 60 vagas em Esposende, num \"curto espaço de tempo, entre seis meses a um ano\".\n\"Por um ano, se houvesse o mínimo de sensibilidade, o Agrupamento de Escolas Vale do Tamel não podia acolher mais dois alunos?\", criticou, sublinhando ser \"lamentável\" que o Estado \"atire para o desemprego pais trabalhadores, para cuidar dos seus filhos com necessidades especiais\".\nOs pais presentes na manifestação empunhavam cartazes com frases como \"Dignidade para os nossos filhos\", \"Somos pais, queremos trabalhar\", \"A deficiência não se esconde\" e \"Respeito pelo cidadão portador de deficiência\".\nO diretor do agrupamento, Alípio Barbosa, manifestou-se indisponível para falar aos jornalistas.\nLeia Também: Homem detido por abusar de filha de amiga em Barcelos.

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nLas fuerzas de seguridad de Turquía han detenido este viernes a más de 30 personas supuestamente vinculadas con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico que planeaban atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en el país, así como contra la Embajada de Irak en la capital, Ankara.\nFuentes de seguridad citadas por la agencia estatal turca de noticias, Anatolia, han indicado que entre los detenidos figura Mikbel al Shuaili, alias 'Abú Yakin al Iraqi', considerado como un miembro de la rama de Inteligencia del grupo yihadista en Turquía.\nAsimismo, entre los detenidos figuran Muhamed Hilaf Ibrahim Ibrahim, alias 'Abú Leis', sospechoso de planear los ataques contra sinagogas e iglesias, e Iheb Elani, alias 'Abdulá al Jumeili', quien presuntamente preparaba un atentado contra la Embajada iraquí.\nEstas fuentes han destacado que otras 29 personas que mantendrían contactos con los tres principales sospechosos también han sido detenidas en la operación, llevada a cabo por los servicios de Inteligencia y la Dirección General de Seguridad.\nPor su parte, el ministro del Interior turco, Ali Yerlikaya, ha destacado en un mensaje en su cuenta en la red social X que \"la lucha contra las organizaciones terroristas y sus colaboradores continuará con determinación\".\nYerlikaya ha destacado que la operación ha tenido como objetivo el 'Batallón Selman-i Farisi', parte de la estructura de Estado Islámico en Turquía, y ha confirmado que estas personas \"habían identificado y llevado a cabo trabajos de reconocimiento sobre lugares de culto judíos y cristianos en Estambul\".\n\"Felicito a los miembros de los servicios de Inteligencia y la Policía que han llevado a cabo las operaciones\", ha dicho. \"Por la paz, unidad y solidaridad de nuestra nación, no toleraremos a los terroristas. Continuaremos nuestra lucha sin interrupción con los grandes esfuerzos de nuestras fuerzas de seguridad\", ha apostillado.\nLa operación ha tenido lugar una semana después de que el propio Yerlikaya anunciada la detención de más de 300 personas por sus presuntos lazos con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico en una serie de operaciones llevadas a cabo en más de 30 provincias del país, en el marco de los esfuerzos contra las actividades de la organización terrorista.\nLas autoridades turcas han llevado a cabo decenas de operaciones contra el grupo durante los últimos años.

    "text": "From Abby Newman's Instagram/buffmommyab Usually one of the main goals of a long prison sentence is to undergo rehabilitation, but in the case of Abby Newman, 4 days in prison were enough to change her whole world. Newman, 28, of Alabama, believes her arrest helped her get her life back after her arrest photos went viral and attracted hundreds of thousands of new followers willing to pay for her provocative content. She says she was in debt before entering prison and 4 days later, when she got out, she earned $24,000 a week from fans who fell in love with her through her arrest photos. The tattooed porn star said that during her short stay in prison, she had no idea the photos had gone viral. She was jailed at different times for two separate charges of disorderly conduct and shoplifting. Her arrest photos were posted on the popular Instagram account Mugshawtys, which shares arrest photos of attractive women to its 680,000 followers. This helped Newman quickly become an internet star as thousands searched for her content on her not-so-updated OnlyFans page. When Newman got out of prison she discovered how many new followers she had gained and used the fame to produce content and make money from it. \"I appeared everywhere,\" she said in a conversation with the Daily Mail, \"I didn't know about it until I was released from prison and I saw that all my online platforms had followers added and I was tagged everywhere with my arrest photos. It turned out for the best, I guess.\" The arrest photos that made her a network star and saved her life: View this post on Instagram A post shared by mugshawtys (@mugshawtys). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Abbie Newman (@buffmommyab). \"The fact that I went to jail saved my life,\" Abby said after using her viral fame to get her OnlyFans account up, \"I was really depressed before the arrest and didn't even connect to OnlyFans for a while. So I got out of jail and was making $24,000 a week, just from customers who added My Snapchat, Twitter and OnlyFans.\" Abby said she went through a difficult time in her life during her arrests last year. \"I went through a lot at the time. I had an abortion and I wasn't myself. I was a complete mess. The truth is, going to prison didn't just help me financially. It also saved my life in a way. I'm recovering from heroin addiction. I've been sober for six years and after having an abortion I found myself on track Darkness of depression. I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and I wasn't on my meds, so it wasn't me.\" More on the topic: Queen of Chaos: The most beautiful criminal in the world became a star because of the arrest photos The sexiest killer in the world, \"Kim Kardashian of the world of crime\", was found dead in a bed of love View this post on Instagram A post shared by Abbie Newman (@buffmommyab).

Newman's first arrest was in April of last year for fighting in public and a few months later she was arrested again for shoplifting on Thanksgiving. Abby added: \"Going viral helped me not only pay my debts and live a more comfortable life. It also helped me get back to myself. I feel blessed that it happened. Most people don't get a second chance and I'm probably on my 10th chance so far, so this is really It's a blessing how it all worked out. I was in jail over Thanksgiving and spent four days in jail total. I ended up getting probation for it.

She said: \"I brought my mother-in-law to the program because she only found out that I was doing porn in an article published in the media, so it was a shock to my fiancé's family.\" Newman has since moved to Augusta, Georgia, with her daughter and her 22-year-old fiancé. She says she would love to increase her following on social media and hopes to appear more on the small screen. More on the same topic: detention onlyfans Network star porn",

    "text": "- Celebrities often face the burden of 'black tax' - the expectation to financially support their family and community\n- Constant scrutiny and lack of privacy are significant downsides of fame, leading to mental health issues such as anxiety, stress, and depression\n- There is pressure on celebrities to maintain a certain image, which can be exhausting and lead to persona adoption and burnout\nThis misconception, he noted, often leads to undue pressure from society and even family members.\nRecommended articles\nFame is often seen as a gateway to wealth, privilege, and a life of luxury. However, for many celebrities, the reality is far more complex.\nKenyan singer Okello Max recently shed light on one of the lesser-known challenges accompanying fame, revealing that the perception of wealth can often be misleading.\nIn an interview with Pulse Live Kenya, Okello Max shared his experiences, stating that the assumption that fame equals wealth is a stereotype that many celebrities struggle with.\n\"There's a stereotype where people see you as famous, and they automatically think you're rich, even when you might be struggling at home without even a shilling to your name,\" Okello explained.\nOne of the most significant pressures that Okello highlighted is the burden of what is commonly referred to as 'black tax'—the expectation that a successful or famous person must financially support their family or community.\nThis burden becomes heavier when one is in the public eye.\n\"Relatives and the black tax will say, 'We see you on TV, how can you not have money? Just help with even a hundred shillings,' when in reality, you might not even have fifty,\" he said, emphasising the unrealistic expectations placed on famous individuals.\nThis constant demand can create a financial strain, especially when one's earnings do not match the perceived wealth.\nPrivacy invasion\nAnother downside of fame is the loss of privacy. Celebrities often face constant scrutiny, with their every move monitored and judged by the public.\nThis lack of privacy can be overwhelming and lead to a life where even the most mundane activities, like shopping or dining out, become a public spectacle.\nThe invasion of privacy extends to social media, where celebrities are often subjected to cyberbullying, trolling, and unsolicited opinions about their personal lives.\nThis continuous exposure can take a toll on their mental health, leading to anxiety, stress, and even depression.\nThe pressure to maintain an image\nFame also comes with the pressure to maintain a certain image. Celebrities are often expected to look perfect, behave impeccably, and live up to the standards set by their fans and the media.\nThis pressure can be exhausting and may force individuals to adopt personas that are far removed from their true selves.\nFor many, the fear of losing relevance or being judged harshly by the public can lead to burnout.\nPulse Influencer Awards:\nGet ready to vote for your favourite influencer\nThe constant need to stay in the limelight and keep up with trends can be mentally and physically draining, leading to a lack of authenticity and a feeling of emptiness.",

    "text": "En la actualidad, el Día de los Inocentes es sinónimo de risas y bromas. En plena efervescencia de las festividades de fin de año, esta jornada se teje entre la Navidad y el Año Nuevo. Sin embargo, más allá del espíritu lúdico de esta fecha conmemorativa, es pertinente mencionar que el\nDía de los Santos Inocentes tiene un trasfondo histórico.\nEl relato bíblico de una matanza: el origen del Día de los Inocentes\nEn los textos sagrados del Nuevo Testamento, un pasaje sombrío se despliega en las páginas del Evangelio de San Mateo y se erige como origen del Día de los Inocentes. Al leer el texto, uno puede conocer sobre\nel mandato despiadado de Herodes el Grande de exterminar a todos los infantes menores de dos años en Belén, un acto dictado por el pánico ante la posible usurpación de su trono por el recién nacido Jesús, señalado por las profecías como el heredero al título de rey de Israel. [Te puede interesar: ¿Cuándo se celebra el Día de los Inocentes 2023 en Perú? Conoce el aterrador origen de su conmemoración](/peru/2023/12/26/dia-de-los-inocentes-2023-cuando-se-celebra-en-peru-y-el-aterrador-origen-de-su-conmemoracion/)\nLa narración bíblica retrata a unos Magos de Oriente que, guiados por una estrella, buscan al mesías para adorarlo. Herodes, con la astucia de un depredador, intentó valerse de los magos para hallar al niño Jesús; sin embargo, ellos, alertados en sueños sobre la malicia del rey, eligen un camino de silencio y prudencia.\nHerodes, al darse cuenta de que había sido burlado por los magos, montó en cólera y mandó matar a todos los niños que había en Belén, en toda la comarca, de dos años para abajo.\nCon el transcurrir del tiempo, este episodio, que antiguamente convocaba duelos, ha mutado a manifestarse en una jornada teñida de humor y picardía. El actual Día de los Inocentes parece distanciarse de su matriz luctuosa, convirtiéndose en una fecha sinónimo de jovialidad y engaños amistosos. Ahora se presta tanto para la rememoración como para el regocijo, contrastando la solemnidad de su origen con la ligereza de su práctica moderna, un tejido de historia y transformación que continúa sorprendiendo y convocando a la reflexión.\n¿Cuántos inocentes murieron asesinados a manos de Herodes?\nEnvuelto en el misterio de las escrituras, el episodio bíblico conocido como la ‘Matanza de los Inocentes’ permanece como uno de los relatos más controvertidos y oscuros. Herodes el Grande, embargado por el miedo a ser destronado, ordena la ejecución de todos los niños menores de dos años en Belén.\nLas cifras de este trágico acontecimiento oscilan en un abanico que va desde los 14 mil varones mencionados por los textos litúrgicos griegos, hasta la cifra abrumadora de 144 mil propuesta por algunos autores medievales, como refiere la Enciclopedia Católica.\nEstas estimaciones gigantescas contrastan con las valoraciones de historiadores actuales, quienes, atendiendo al tamaño modesto del Belén de aquel entonces, reducen el número a apenas unas pocas vidas, quizá entre seis y veinte. Esta considerable diferencia pone en evidencia no solo la evolución de las interpretaciones históricas sino también las limitaciones de los métodos antiguos para consignar sucesos.\n[Te puede interesar: Giacomo Bocchio revela su receta de Lonche Navideño con toques tradicionales](/peru/2023/12/09/lonche-navideno-la-curiosa-receta-de-giacomo-bocchio-para-disfrutar-con-la-familia-y-amigos/)\nSegún el relato sagrado, en un acto providencial, un ángel alerta a José en sueños, lo que permite la fuga de su familia hacia Egipto, sorteando la orden despiadada de Herodes. Esta fuga es celebrada en la fe cristiana como una intervención divina que preservó la vida del niño Jesús que cambiaría la historia.\nA lo largo de los siglos, la comunidad cristiana ha elevado a los pequeños mártires de Belén al rango de ‘Santos Inocentes’, integrándolos en el calendario litúrgico como símbolos de inocencia y sufrimiento inmerecido. A pesar de que la veracidad histórica del evento es tema de discusión, su impacto en la memoria colectiva es incuestionable.\n¿Por qué se hacen bromas el 28 de diciembre?\nEl Día de los Inocentes y sus jocosas tradiciones tienen un origen que sorprende por su contraste. Pese a recordar una tragedia bíblica, el paso del tiempo ha transformado este día en una jornada de risas y travesuras.\n[Te puede interesar: Navidad con tu mascota: consejos para proteger a perros y gatos de los fuegos artificiales](/peru/2023/12/22/navidad-con-tu-mascota-consejos-para-proteger-a-perros-y-gatos-de-los-fuegos-artificiales/)\nSegún Gustavo Ludeña, destacado investigador del Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, es un enigma cómo se pasó de la solemnidad al humor en esta fecha. Esta curiosa transición se abordó en una entrevista otorgada a National Geographic, en la cual Ludeña señala la falta de claridad sobre este cambio de perspectiva respecto al Día de los Inocentes.\n“Si bien las causas que llevaron a relacionar la matanza de parte de Herodes con las bromas son inciertas, este evento no se debe estudiar de manera aislada. En cambio, es preciso atender a las apropiaciones locales y regionales de las costumbres o celebraciones pautadas por la Iglesia católica”, comentó el experto para una entrevista a National Geographic.\nHoy, las risas se entrelazan con la memoria histórica y religiosa cada\n28 de diciembre. La festividad tiene raíces que se hunden en la narrativa cristiana, en un acto de astucia para proteger al infante Jesús, y en estrategias desesperadas de familias evitando una cruel sentencia.\n¿De qué trata la ‘Fiesta de los Locos’?\nLa tradición del Día de los Inocentes se entrelaza también con el eco festivo de ancestrales celebraciones paganas como la ‘Fiesta de los Locos’, que durante la Edad Media hacía vibrar Francia con una explosión de danzas, cánticos y disfraces que subvertían el orden establecido. Según un artículo de Britannica, esta conmemoración tenía lugar en torno al 1 de enero, y consistía en designar un falso obispo o papa, momento en el cual se invertían los roles sociales y se parodiaban los rituales eclesiásticos, en un desbordante y jocoso caos ceremonial.\nEstos acontecimientos se perfilan como una versión reinterpretada por el cristianismo de las saturnales romanas, una fusión que da cuenta de la adaptabilidad y sincretismo religioso.\n“Ya en el siglo XIII, tales celebraciones se manifestaban como una farsa directa de la moral y el culto cristiano. A pesar de los esfuerzos de erradicación, incluso con las severas sanciones decretadas por el Concilio de Basilea en 1431, estos festines desenfrenados perduraron, desafiando censuras, hasta su declive final en el siglo XVI”, detalla la enciclopedia, narrando la persistencia y la evolución de estas costumbres en el entramado de lo que conocemos hoy como el Día de los Inocentes.\nMás Noticias\n[El hermano del artista rompió su silencio luego de permanecer varias horas en el domicilio del fallecido cantante.
