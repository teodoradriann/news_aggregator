    "text": "1 of only 5 pharmacies in west Louisville is closing One of five pharmacies in west Louisville will soon close its doors. The CVS located on Portland Avenue will be closing on Jan. 18. While local store management was unable to comment, they did say that they are sad to see the store close. All CVS customers at the Portland location will now have their prescriptions transferred to the closest CVS location on Fourth Street and W Muhammad Ali Boulevard. Nearby residents said that takes 'convenient' out of 'convenience store.' \"If you go to Muhammad Ali, you're going to have to pay to park, worry if you're going to get tickets or not. I got a ticket like four weeks ago for parking down there because I picked somebody else's prescriptions up,\" said Aaron Maupin, a longtime customer at the Portland CVS. \"This is the closest place where I can get my medication, and now I'm going to have to travel a few miles,\" Don Young, who lives in the nearby Shawnee neighborhood, said. \"Without the proper transportation, it'll be hard for you to get around and everything. That's was going to hurt a lot of us around here, not being able to have the proper transportation.\" Russell neighborhood resident Yah Yah is also part of the organization Change Today Change Tomorrow, which helps to fill the gaps in resources in west Louisville. On Thursday, Yah Yah said she believes the lack of resources, like pharmacies and grocery stores, is one of the contributing factors to the high crime in west Louisville. \"The violence comes from a lack of resources. You bring the resources in, I guarantee you the violence is going to decrease because that's one of the things that people feel like they have to fight for, resources,\" Yah Yah said. Change Today Change Tomorrow already has programs in place, like their weekly free grocery giveaway, to help fill the voids in the area. Yah Yah said the new need for access to pharmacies will just be another issue the group will work to tackle. \"It's going to be tough,\" Yah Yah said. While residents are frustrated to lose another asset in the area, some are remaining optimistic. \"The West End is trying to build up a lot better, so I know they'll find something good to put in here,\" Young said. The store's final day will be Jan. 18. WLKY reached out to CVS's corporate office for comment but did not hear back.",

    "text": "Gerwyn Price was sensationally turfed out of Alexandra Palace by Brendan Dolan as the 'Iceman' melted like a glacier in global warming. In a huge upset, 50-year-old Dolan progressed to the Paddy Power PDC World Championship fourth round with a 4-2 win against the No.5 seed. After his wife, Bethan, sat through a harrowing defeat alone in the players' enclosure, Price - who lifted the Sid Waddell Trophy here three years ago – can have no complaints. READ MORE: Gerwyn Price knocked out of PDC World Darts Championship by 28th seed in major upset READ MORE: Luke Littler says 'it's crazy' as he is stopped by Arsenal's Rice and Ramsdale for picture [Learn more](/affiliates/) Get all the sport you could ever ask for Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to Cricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels. Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year. £22 a monthSky On an Instagram post he wrote: “Absolutely gutted with the chances I gave away tonight, trying too hard and beating myself up. “Just want to say how much I appreciate the crowd that got behind me. Just couldn't get a flow and Brendan took out every chance I gave him. Well done to him and hopefully I'll learn from this.” Look no further than 23 missed darts at a double, Gezzy. That's where your hopes of a second title went south. Do you think we'll see Price back at Ally Pally next year? Let us know in the comments section. Dolan, a popular Northern Irishman who is nobody's mug, was pipped 4-3 by Price at the same stage of the competition three years ago to the day. He milked his revenge like a dairy maid, and who can blame him? Dolan said: “I'm buzzing at the moment, feeling over the moon. I was thinking we might go to a final leg, to reminisce about what happened when we played years ago, but thank God we didn't. “If I go on to win the title, it would be perfect revenge, but it's too early to talk about that. As far as I'm concerned, Gezzy is a class act and he didn't deserve the boos.” Although his reception at the walk-on was mixed, Price cannot blame the crowd for scattering his arrows across the board as if they had been blown off-course by Storm Gerrit. Although he recovered from a supine opening set to level the contest, the Welshman never settled. And although he had not gone out of the tournament before the quarter-finals since 2018, Price played like a man who felt the whole audience wanted him to lose – even though they didn't. The 'Iceman' had revealed, after his first-round win against Connor Scutt, that he had almost withdrawn from the competition because he was apprehensive about fans getting on his back. But no excuses about hostility from the fancy-dress riff-raff – perceived or otherwise – will wash, nor explain, Price's hit-and-miss performance. And his body language was terrible. It wasn't so much Pan's People as Down-the-Pan's People. When Dolan took out 120 to take control of fifth set – his third ton-plus checkout of the night – Price's pained expression was pure despair. He never had control of the contest and got what he deserved.",

    "text": "The Brazilian Keratin Treatment has been demonized a lot in the media and hair universe since it was first released onto the market a few years ago. But I’m not here to defend it, not at all.\nFor those of you that don’t know, formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable, strong-smelling chemical that is used in building materials, for embalming the dead and to produce numerous beauty and household products.\nFormaldehyde is classified as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer with links to several cancers including nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia.\nThe worrying trend in manufacturers lately has been to ‘hide’ it from labels by using synonyms that only their scientist buddies can decipher as being formaldehyde.\nIn fact a lot of BKT’s that claim to be formaldehyde free have actually tested as having worryingly high levels of the chemical.\nEven though I have dabbled with BKT (formaldehyde free of course) in the past myself, I would not readily recommend it as viable hair treatment until the manufacturers clean up their act. Not to mention the horror stories we’ve heard of women not getting their curls back after the treatment but I digress.\nOf course there are a few hair smoothing products out there that are genuinely formaldehyde free but since we have so many bad apples ruining the party for everyone else, it’s just not worth trolling through the literature to find out what safe to use or not.\nIt’s funny however that we complain vehemently when we discover that our hair and beauty products contain formaldehyde when in fact we are ingesting this very chemical in large amounts daily anyway.\nI bet most of you don’t even know that aldehydes are produced during the digestion of Coca cola! I don’t know about you but I think that it is invariably worse to get aldehyde directly into my body by consuming soda than applying formaldehyde topically while using BKT.\nI’m not saying that formaldehyde is great, on the contrary I’m just saying we need to be more aware that it is not just in our hair products. It’s in many nail hardeners, varnishes, household cleaning products, lotions, bubble bath, glues, plywood, soap bars, body wash, toothpaste and chillingly in baby wipes too.\nBe wary when you see any of these names on your product labels as they could be synonyms for formaldehyde:\nMethylaldehyde Formalin Methanal Methylaldehyde Phenol Formaldehyde Oxymethyline 1,3-Dioxetane Quaternium 15 Formic Aldehyde Methylene Oxide Oxomethane Formalin Dmdm Hydantoin It’s should be obvious by now that the Brazilian Keratin Treatment is not even close to being the biggest source of formaldehyde in our daily lives. So next time before you turn your nose up at that ‘natural’ sister who has been using BKT and imagine that she is doing herself a harm with all that forma-whatchu-call-it , think about the lovely bubble bath you treated yourself to before the pedicure appointment that you enjoyed while sipping cola. Uh huh.\nManufacturers hiding formaldehyde in their products is wrong on so many levels. My advice? Stick with natural hair products .",
