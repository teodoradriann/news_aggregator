    "title": "After agent’s death, legislators grill MD officials about lack of communication and safety policies",
    "text": "Legislators on Thursday grilled and sought policy promises from Maryland’s public safety and correctional services secretary and other department officials about the lack of communication, safety policies and adequate equipment for parole and probation agents. The legislators were clearly agitated by what they viewed as a lack of sufficient improvement in the Division of Parole and Probation in the months since Davis Martinez, a 33-year-old agent, was found dead on May 31 inside the Chevy Chase home of a man he was monitoring. The man, Emanuel Edward Sewell, 54, was released in 2021 after nearly 25 years in prison for breaking into a man’s home and brutally sexually assaulting him, according to news reports. He was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and has since been deemed not competent to stand trial. It appeared that parole and probation agents may still be unable to easily access new protective equipment, including bulletproof and stab-proof vests. For communication while conducting home visits, the agents carry just a cellphone, much to the surprise of Republican Sen. Bill Folden, a police officer who questioned why agents don’t carry a two-way radio. The division is burdened by its caseload, with each agent often handling more cases than national standards call for, said Democratic Sen. Sarah Elfreth. The caseloads are driven in part by vacancies at the division, which officials hope will be filled in the coming months. Four legislative committees scheduled the hearing in response to Martinez’s death in May. Leaders of Maryland’s largest public union in June called for a new home visit policy and investigation into the Division of Parole and Probation. Public Safety and Correctional Services Services Carolyn J. Scruggs said Thursday that a department investigation into the incident found no violations of department policy contributing to the tragedy. But, the secretary said, “it became clear that the mindset surrounding the supervision practices within (the Division of Parole and Probation) needed to be strengthened.” Scruggs replaced the director and two other top officials within the division shortly after the incident, and on Thursday she outlined a series of other changes or plans for changes within the division, including a stress-call system for agents conducting home visits. Questions remained, though. It was unclear to lawmakers on Thursday why Martinez was missing for several hours before an emergency call was placed. Scruggs at one point said that there wasn’t a specific policy in place for when to call the police in such an event. Police officers can accompany parole and probation agents on their home visits, but law enforcement agencies are often too understaffed and overstretched to do so. Democratic Del. Jared Solomon said he expects the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to establish a written policy stating that the agents must have an officer accompany them on home visits, even if it requires delaying a scheduled visit to accommodate an officer’s schedule. Martinez was alone when he visited Sewell’s home. Following Martinez’s death, the AFSCME Maryland Council 3 union suspended in-home agent visits and called for the division to continue virtual home visits until officials negotiated a new policy with the union. The practice remained suspended as of Thursday. Union members have said that Scruggs and her department repeatedly ignored their concerns about agents’ safety, and that Martinez’s death could have been prevented if officials had listened to member’s attempts to discuss health and safety issues.",

    "text": "SINGAPORE: A woman took to social media to share that she is starting over at 34 after her soon-to-be ex-husband allegedly took most of her money during their marriage.\nPosting on the r/singaporefi forum on Wednesday (July 16), the woman revealed that she and her husband have two children, and she is now filing for divorce for “many reasons,” including financial abuse.\nShe explained that she had been trying to support his business financially, but her husband took the help for granted and kept demanding more money. Eventually, he began “threatening” her when she hesitated to give in to his requests.\n“I left the house with just S$2k in cash,” she shared. “It was so devastating, but I guess it will be a good start again.”\nThe woman, who now works as a freelance tutor earning between S$3.5k and\nS$4k a month, said she’s trying to rebuild her life from scratch.\nShe also asked others in the community if they had any advice for her, writing: “Anyone with similar experience care to share what you’ve done to start over? I’ve been wondering if I need to upskill myself, too. I think I’ve been so isolated from the real world for so long during my marriage.”\n“We need the fire to show our children that Mum is strong and we can survive.”\nAfter reading the woman’s plea for help, many Singaporean Reddit users chimed in to offer words of comfort and advice.\nOne user commented, “Sorry to hear that. But increasing your income is your main priority right now. There is always a rainbow after the rain, and please do not despair. I know it is easy to say this, but you gotta stay strong for yourself and for your two children. They need you.”\nAnother wrote, “Sorry to hear that. I hope he’s not abusive (physical violence) otherwise, do get court protection. Get support from family members if they can help to tide over this tough period.\nThey continued, “You have done the right thing. Things will only get better the moment you muster the courage to step out of a toxic relationship and environment. Continue doing what you are good at; switch out tutoring if it is no longer sustainable. Try group tuition at lower fees if parents are ok.”\nA third user, who coincidentally is the same age and going through the same situation as the woman, said: “It’s okay to start over. Single mothers are quite resilient, and age does not matter. We need the fire to show our children that Mummy is strong and we can survive.”\nShe added, “You can try to explore career conversion programmes too under WSG and see which one piques your interest. All the best.”\nIn other news, a 25-year-old jobseeker was left unsettled after being repeatedly asked about her marital status during a virtual interview with a multinational corporation (MNC).\nOn Tuesday (July 15), the woman took to the r/askSingapore Reddit forum to share her experience and seek advice.\nAccording to her post, the interview was conducted virtually and one-on-one with a middle-aged manager from the department she had applied to, rather than a representative from human resources.\nRead more: ‘Are you single?’: Female jobseeker disturbed by personal questions on marital status during job interview\nSee also Man disheartened after his long-lost friends wanted to \"catch up\" with him just to ask for money since he started a business\nFeatured image by freepik (for illustration purposes only)",

    "title": "Florida man’s DIY strapped down house makes it through Hurricane Milton unscathed",
    "text": "A Florida man’s efforts to batten down the hatches and prevent his home from being damaged by Hurricane Milton that hit the state earlier this week appear to have paid off.\nIn a photo that went viral, homeowner Pedro Casares of Orlando had the crazy idea of ​​securing his family’s home in an attempt to prevent further damage when the Category 3 storm hit the area.\nDespite the skepticism of those who saw the image before the storm, Casares’s advance planning appears to have saved the house from any significant damage.\nOriginally from Puerto Rico, Casares planted metal hooks in the ground embedded within 8 feet of cement.\nOrlando resident Pedro Casares insured his entire home before Hurricane Milton.\nAfter the storm, everything seemed to stay in place, including the roof.\nHuge plastic straps, the type normally used to hold cargo containers in position on ships, were then attached to hooks in the floor to prevent the roof from lifting when the storm hit the area.\nCasares spent $22,000 on the custom-made cement anchors and straps that lined the roof of the family home and are said to be able to support 5,400 pounds of weight.\nThe ingenious precautions came after the family was hit by a hurricane while living in Guaynabo on the Caribbean island, which saw the aluminum roof of their home nearly peel off.\ntiktok user SimplyUniqueSmiles93 Casares’ daughter, gave viewers a long-awaited tour of the house to allow fans to see how the house had fared.\n‘The house, fortunately we are fine. There are a lot of leaves everywhere but everything is still intact. There are many affected areas near our house,” he explained during a walk.\nCasares’ daughter gave viewers a much-anticipated tour of the house to allow fans to see how the house had fared.\nThe TikToker said the house remained unscathed and not a single tile was missing.\nThe family says the straps will remain in the house until hurricane season ends in December.\n‘The house is intact. Not a single tile or tile has been lifted from the roof. Everything’s fine. We won’t take off our straps until the hurricane passes!’ he added.\nBefore the storm hit, social media users were captivated by Casares’ idea.\nMost said they were impressed with his efforts, calling him a “legend” and praising him for “thinking outside the box.”\n“This is the most Florida thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” one person joked.\n“Everyone is laughing now, but this guy will be a legend when all the other houses are floating down the street and he’s sitting in the pool in his new living room watching TV powered by a Starlink terminal,” someone else wrote .\n‘I really respect the effort. I hope it’s effective,’ another user added.\n“He’s thinking outside the box, he needs more people like him…” reads a fourth tweet.\nA fifth said: ‘Bro secured his house like a piano when he moved in. Absolute legend.’\nThe straps can support 5,400 pounds of weight and are connected to metal hooks attached to concrete sunk 8 feet underground.\nThe family also covered the windows to prevent entry during strong winds.\nFlorida residents trudged through flooded streets, picked up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes after Hurricane Milton devastated coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.\nTO At least 10 people had died and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton was not worse off.\nthe hurricane It avoided a direct hit on densely populated Tampa, and the deadly storm surge scientists feared never materialized.\nFlorida’s vital tourism industry has begun to return to normal with the reopening of Walt Disney World and other theme parks.\nThe state’s busiest airport, in Orlando, also resumed full operations on Friday.",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
