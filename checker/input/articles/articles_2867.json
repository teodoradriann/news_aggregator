    "text": "Modelo do Google foi mais preciso que o principal sistema convencional do mundo para prever eventos climáticos de três a dez dias Imagem: Marcello Casal Jr./Agência Brasil Por Gabriel Andrade 02 17:00 2 minutos de leitura Uma IA ( inteligência artificial ) desenvolvida pelo Google se mostrou capaz de prever as condições climáticas com dez dias de antecedência e 90% de precisão. Aliás, isso tudo sem precisar de supercomputadores.\nQual a diferença entre clima e tempo? Relatório climático da ONU sugere como reduzir mudanças climáticas Só para ter uma ideia do investimento que normalmente é necessário para essas previsões, o Brasil pretende investir R$ 200 milhões em um supercomputador para prever o tempo com mais exatidão.\nEm estudo publicado na revista Science , os cientistas responsáveis mostraram o nível de precisão da nova ferramenta, chamada de GraphCast.\nA ferramenta tem como base dados meteorológicos coletados em tempo real. O modelo foi mais preciso, por exemplo, que o principal sistema convencional do mundo para previsão do tempo de três a dez dias, a HRES (Previsão de Alta Resolução).\nPrevisão de eventos climáticos mais rápida e mais barata A principal vantagem é o tempo para processar a quantidade colossal de dados e formular a previsão, de 60 segundos. Tudo isso sem ter a necessidade de usar nenhum computador – muito menos uma maquina milionária.\nEm uma época onde tem-se falado cada vez mais sobre fenômenos climáticos, a ferramenta pode ajudar os governos a anteciparem eventos extremos.\n“GraphCast dá um passo significativo na IA para previsão do tempo, oferecendo previsões mais precisas e eficientes. Ele abre caminhos para apoiar a tomada de decisões críticas para as necessidades de nossas indústrias e sociedades”, diz o Google em um comunicado .\nAlém disso, para mostrar que é fácil usar a ferramenta, os pesquisadores publicaram modelo de testes , no qual você definir as datas e a área desejada e verificar como funciona.\nPrevisão para eventos climáticos na América Latina feita usando a IA. Imagem: ECMWF/Reprodução\n“Ser pioneiro no uso da IA ​​na previsão do tempo beneficiará bilhões de pessoas em suas vidas cotidianas. Mas a nossa investigação mais ampla não se trata apenas de antecipar o clima. Trata-se de compreender os padrões mais amplos do nosso clima”, de acordo a empresa.\n#clima #google #iA #inteligência artificial #previsão do tempo Gabriel Andrade Jornalista que cobre ciência, economia e tudo mais.

    "text": "An aerial view of Eros Oysters, a saltwater farm on Robinhood Cove in Georgetown. Mark Gaffney photo\nLast Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) notified the University of Maine that it would immediately end its funding for the Maine Sea Grant — a key program that has bolstered coastal communities and created thousands of marine jobs over the past 50 years.\nIn a termination letter provided to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, NOAA official Timothy Carrington wrote that the activities of Maine Sea Grant are “no longer relevant to the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”\nWednesday, the administration agreed to renegotiate funding for Maine Sea Grant following conversations between U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnik and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\nThe renegotiation would put funding back on the table so long as the work supported by the program “ focuses on advancing Maine’s coastal economies, working waterfronts and sustainable fisheries,” Collins’ office said in an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon. But the uncertainty still has fishermen and harvesters worried.\nRelated Maine Sea Grant in jeopardy after Trump administration terminated $4.5 million grant program The move to terminate the program — part of the White House’s efforts to slash the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s budget — leaves the fishery organization’s programming and 20 employees in limbo.\n“Thanks to Maine Sea Grant support, Maine’s fishermen, coastal communities and marine economy are experiencing employment and earnings growth, and are increasingly well positioned to lead and innovate for a more resilient future,” said Maine Sea Grant Director Gayle Zydlewski. “This notice is devastating for our team and countless partners, the University of Maine and the entire state.”\nData from NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management in 2024 indicates that Maine has experienced a 10% increase in marine jobs over the past decade.\nNow, many are wondering how that might change.\nAndrew Buchner checks floating beds at Eros Oyster on Sept. 20, 2024. Laura Sitterly / The Times Record\nAlarm bells Blue economy advocates say terminating the program would be “destructive.”\nAmong those voices is Buzz Scott, the president of OceansWide, a nonprofit that works with fishermen to recover old fishing gear from Maine’s seafloor from Boothbay Harbor to Matinicus Isle.\nRelated A dive to declutter Boothbay Harbor He was at the Fisherman’s Forum in Rockland when he first heard the news.\n“Maine Sea Grant is a family to all who work with them,” Scott said. “They have helped us network with funding sources and introduced innovative ways to repurpose lobster traps/marine debris. Losing them will reduce the advancements we’ve made in the Gulf of Maine. … Waters that were, and could be again, the fish basket of the world.”\nBen Martens, executive director of the Brunswick-based Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, agreed.\n“Maine Sea Grant isn’t just another program,” Martens said. “They have cultivated a group of amazingly dedicated people who are leaders in our communities. More importantly, they are helpers. When crisis hits, like the working waterfront disaster of last January, they were on the frontline. This loss will hurt our working waterfront today but devastate our shared future.”\nRelated Midcoast ‘bouncing forward’ a year after devastating January 2024 storms Eros Oysters staff Andrew Buchner (right), Jeff Lou and Mark Gaffney monitor the floating beds. Courtesy of Eros Oysters\nThew Suskiewicz, a seaweed cultivation science coordinator at Atlantic Sea Farms in Biddeford, has worked closely with program staff. Through postdoctoral research at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science, he authored a recent study on rapid ocean warming in the Gulf of Maine over the past 30 years.\nMaine Sea Grant funded the project and facilitated connections among urchin fishermen, harvesters and scientists. The findings, published in the journal “Ecology,” demonstrate dramatic shifts in coastal ecosystems, particularly in kelp beds.\nRelated Midcoast kelp forests in flux Suskiewicz broke the program’s benefits down into different tiers. Financially, it “saves Maine from incurring high costs related to restoration, cleanup and other issues.” Regarding knowledge transfer, “it bridges scientists and industry members” and educates the next generation on how to “run hatcheries, grow seaweed and market oysters.”\n“As a biologist, I’m trained to address scientific questions,” Suskiewicz said. “I view situations differently than a lobsterman looking to grow kelp on the side, focused on the cost of fuel, social capital involved, where to set up a kelp farm and the labor challenges. That’s where Sea Grant steps in — they excel at connecting people and proposing economically viable solutions.\n“It’s unrealistic to expect someone who has dedicated their entire career to studying cells to think like a farmer and vice versa; the unifying role of Maine Sea Grant is critical.”\nA view of Andrew Buchner’s small aquaculture farm on Westport Island — Brooks Cove Oyster. Andrew Buchner photo\n‘The program is an essential service’ Andrew Buchner, a part-time employee at Eros Oyster in Georgetown and owner of Brooks Cove Oyster in Westport Island, further described the program’s role in supporting Maine’s working waterfront.\n“Maine Sea Grant provides invaluable advice to small-scale operators,” Buchner said. “Last year, I participated in a free boot camp that helped me and 20 other students launch careers in the industry. We got guidance on critical issues launching our business with just a phone call or email — like oyster mortality and growing techniques.”\nBuchner aims to grow his aquaculture farm from 40,000 to 110,000 oysters this year but feels wary without the strong support system that he had before.\n“There are over 600 small farms in Maine, like mine, that rely on Maine Sea Grant,” Buchner said. “No matter the size, they stand for us all.”\nBuchner has already contacted lawmakers to ask that they lobby and advocate for the program’s restoration of funding.\n“I understand government efficiency is an issue, but we should be more discerning,” Buchner said. “Programs that promote the working waterfront and small business should not be cut in my opinion.”\nMike Gaffney, owner of Eros Oysters, previously taught at Cornell University, New York state’s land-grant university, similar to the University of Maine.\nTo highlight the significance of this loss, he explained that extension services began in 1862 by creating a land-grant university system to benefit farmers. Maine Sea Grant, established in 1966, expanded these services to support marine food producers and sea farmers.\n“The extension agent links the scientific community to food producers,” Gaffney said. “It makes research applicable to farmers and helps them improve their harvest. This approach has been effective in agriculture for over a century and has supported fisheries and aquaculture for the past 50 years.”\nIn times of crisis, like significant die-offs or declining clam populations due to green crabs, Eros Oysters has sought help from Sea Grant agent Dana Morse and his colleagues at the Darling Marine Center and Downeast Institute .\n“The program is an essential service,” Gaffney said. “It’s not just an add-on; it’s truly necessary. And perhaps more than other states, Maine relies on the marine component of the land grant extension service due to the importance of our fisheries.”\nAndrew Buchner holds salt water oysters that matured in Robinhood Cove. Laura Sitterly / The Times Record\nLawmakers step in On March 1, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, posted on Facebook, drawing a connection between President Donald Trump’s recent spat with Maine Gov. Janet Mills over transgender athletes and the Maine Sea Grant shutdown.\n“It seems pretty clear the President now has a personal vendetta against our state, and is willing to go to any length to settle the score — no matter how petty, and regardless of the toll,” Pingree wrote. “In making these cuts, the administration claimed that the work of Maine Sea Grant is ‘no longer relevant.’ This is not only insulting, but demonstrates an alarming lack of understanding of the essential role grants and scientific studies play in sustaining our fisheries and coastal economies.”\nOf the 34 Sea Grant programs nationwide, Maine has been the only one to lose its funding — prompting her suggestion that the decision was made to punish the state.\nThe four-year agreement would have awarded the group $4.5 million in operating funds through Jan. 21, 2028, and nearly $1.5 million this year.\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, and Pingree co-signed a letter to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnik expressing their “outrage and deep disappointment.”\nRelated King, Pingree and Collins urge Trump administration to reinstate Maine Sea Grant funding Regardless of intention, Gaffney underscored the profound implications this move will have.\n“We rely on our seafood production,” Gaffney said. “Maine Sea Grant is a vital university extension service for fishermen and sea farmers. Eliminating it would have significant consequences on marine production.”",

    "text": "|Eugene Mulero\nSenior Reporter\nHouse Lawmakers Lead Push on Autonomous Truck Policy\nStay on top of transportation news: [Get TTNews in your inbox.]\nLegislation that aims to establish a nationwide policy framework for autonomous commercial vehicles was recently introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nBefore the August recess, Rep. Vince Fong (R-Calif.) led the introduction of the Autonomous Mobility Ensuring Regulation, Innovation, Commerce, and Advancement Driving Reliability in Vehicle Efficiency and Safety, or AMERICA DRIVES, Act. The legislation seeks to establish a commercial automated driving system (ADS) network to modernize supply chain and freight workforce operations.\n“By establishing a federal framework for autonomous trucks and empowering the Department of Transportation to set practical regulations, we can safely scale this emerging technology nationwide,” Fong, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last month.\nRELATED: Aurora Earns First Revenue in a Quarter of Milestones\nFong\n“The AMERICA DRIVES Act provides a clear path for adoption across state lines, helping support supply chain efficiency, strengthen domestic commerce, and ensure the United States remains unbeatable in the global marketplace,” the bill sponsor explained. “It’s time to seize the opportunity to chart a safe, innovative path forward for American transportation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort so we can deliver results for the future of freight.”\nThe bill, which awaits consideration in committee, is meant as a proposal likely to gain consideration during Congress’ crafting of comprehensive highway policy legislation. Approving a multiyear surface transportation bill before a fall 2026 authorizing deadline is a priority for congressional leaders. The most recent highway policy authorization was tucked into the Biden-era $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure law.\nRELATED: Autonomous Tech Firm Kodiak Clears Runway for Public Launch\nSpecifically, the legislation would establish a federal framework for human drivers in commercial vehicles as well as update federal specifications to reflect ADS-equipped vehicles. The measure also would require federal regulators to agree on terms and guidance designed to facilitate the technology’s adoption. Nearly three dozen states accommodate various levels of autonomous truck testing, analyses or limited deployment.\nA Zoox autonomous robotaxi in San Francisco in December. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\nThe bill’s primary policy proposal responds to long-standing concerns about a lack of a national framework specific to the emerging technology. Key industry stakeholders applauded the legislation.\nRELATED: Aurora Begins Nighttime Autonomous Truck Service\nDrake\nJohn Drake, vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted: “[Autonomous vehicle] technologies promise significant benefits for many Americans — but the lack of federal action in recent years is undermining our global leadership. This legislation advances several common-sense actions that will help advance the promise of AVs — while putting American businesses in a stronger position to compete.”\n“AMERICA DRIVES Act is a welcome and bold step toward a federal policy framework for autonomous vehicles,” argued Jeff Farrah, CEO of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association. “By embracing the benefits of autonomous trucking, Rep. Fong’s bill will strengthen American supply chains, enhance road safety and keep the United States at the forefront of transportation innovation.”\nRELATED: NHTSA Exempts Amazon's Steering-Wheel-Free Zoox Robotaxi\nAt a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, American Trucking Associations addressed the topic with senior policymakers. ATA President Chris Spear affirmed that the trucking federation will “continue to advocate for a strong federal framework for automated vehicle testing and deployment.”\n“Such a federal framework is critical for ensuring the safety and trust of the public and necessary for testing the efficacy of automated vehicles in interstate commerce,” Spear said. “A federal framework also provides clear paths for new and innovative technologies to move from testing to deployment through established DOT processes. This can include exemptions, interpretations, investigations or data requirements designed to ensure safety and build public trust.”\nA Senate version of the bill has yet to be debated.\nWant more news?
