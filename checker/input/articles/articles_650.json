    "text": "Un avion à destination de Londres en provenance de Californie a effectué un atterrissage risqué à l'aéroport de Londres Heathrow, mercredi 27 décembre, au point de rebondir au moment de l'atterrissage. La vidéo filmée par un caméraman plutôt bavard montre le moment où un Boeing 777 exploité par American Airlines a rencontré des vents latéraux alors qu'il effectuait un atterrissage à l'aéroport de Heathrow à Londres, en plein durant la tempête Gerrit. L'homme derrière la caméra alimente en contenu la chaîne YouTube [BigJet TV](https://www.youtube.com/c/bigjettv), dédiée aux passionnés de gros avions (oui, apparemment ces gens existent). Le caméraman, stupéfait, peine à cacher son émotion lorsqu'il voit l'avion en galère réussir son atterrissage. Cette vidéo a ainsi fait le tour des réseaux sociaux. (sbo) L'année 2023 n'aura pas été une année toute rose pour le secteur des jeux vidéos, lequel aura connu un record de suppressions d'emplois. Des licenciements par milliers alors que l'activité du secteur se porte pourtant très bien avec un bilan de 187,7 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires. Une année qui aura connu du lourd et avec des titres particulièrement attendus comme Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Diablo IV, Starfield, Spider-Man 2 ou encore le «jeu de l'année» Baldur's Gate III.",

    "text": "CBC Yellowknifer criticizes shrill sound outside downtown mall as anti-homeless tactic Read full article CBC January 25, 2024 at 11:44 p.m. · 4 min read A piercing noise can be heard from the Centre Square Mall parkade in downtown Yellowknife. (Jenna Dulewich/CBC - image credit)\nThe shrill noise coming from the parkade at Centre Square Mall in Yellowknife, N.W.T., continues and has people in the city criticizing the 24-hour squeal in the capital's downtown.\nCBC has not been able to confirm the source of the noise; the condo board associated with the building has said it has nothing to do with the parkade , and recent calls and an email to the mall's property manager went unanswered.\n\"That mall holds the visitor centre for the GNWT as well as the library,\" said Joseph Bannon, a Yellowknifer and father.\n\"It's really given me second thoughts about whether or not I should go to the library and take my son there, because we would be bombarded by that sound on the way in.\"\nThe sound is also giving Bannon's wife a headache, and some of her coworkers have reported similar symptoms, he said.\nSome Yellowknifers guess that the sound is coming from a noisemaker, a device that emits a piercing sound to discourage loitering.\n\"I'm really frustrated because it seems like the entire tactic of it is just to push homeless people away,\" Bannon said. \"They're already a vulnerable part of society.\"\nBut city councillor Rob Warburton, who is also a downtown business owner, said it's unfair to paint the initiative as an attack on people who are homeless.\n\"My understanding is that is there to try and prohibit the loitering from occurring,\" Warburton told CBC.\n\"[The city] has no loitering bylaw, and in the territory, we have no trespass act, so there's no bylaws or rules or regulations that anyone can use to address it in any way.\"\nA sign in a window in Peace River, Alta. The Town of Hay River enacted its first public behaviours bylaw this week, which includes fines for spitting, loitering, fighting and public intoxication. A sign in a window in Peace River, Alta. The City of Yellowknife considered enacting a public behaviours bylaw, which could have included fines for spitting, loitering, fighting and public intoxication, but did not believe it would have the desired impact of eradicating bad behaviour. (Sara Minogue/CBC)\nStory continues T he town of Hay River passed a public behaviour bylaw last year outlawing spitting, fighting and public urination, largely adopting a similar bylaw that passed in Inuvik in 2020.\nYellowknife administration raised the possibility of developing such a bylaw during a Governance and Priorities committee meeting last October but said that it would not be \"expected to have the desired impact of eradicating bad behaviour.\"\nWarburton said he would like council to look at what other jurisdictions have done to address loitering and create tools to solve the problem in Yellowknife.\n\"What are we doing as a community right now to address this?\" he asked.\n\"Essentially nothing – because it seems like as soon as you have a conversation around public safety or loitering, it just gets painted with this brush that you're insensitive or you don't care, [and] nothing could be further from the truth.\"\nTwo noise complaints filed\nRight now, businesses are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on security, and shoppers are paying for it in their purchases, he added.\nThe City of Yellowknife does have a noise bylaw that prohibits noise that disturbs people's rest or comfort during the city's quiet time, which is between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.\nThe noise from the parking garage can currently be heard around the clock.\nYellowknife's bylaw manager has been off the job for more than a month, CBC News has learned. The City of Yellowknife says it did not approve the shrill noise to be emitted 24-hours a day downtown. (CBC)\nNoise is defined in the bylaw as any unnecessary and excessive sound, including any sound that is \"loud or harsh or undesirable.\"\nViolations are punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 for an individual or up to $20,000 for a corporation.\nThe city manager has not approved any noise exemptions for the area, officials said.\nTwo noise complaints have been filed in relation to the sound, they said.\n\"Municipal Enforcement Division has been in touch with Centre Square Mall property management and continues to work with them to find resolution,\" Abby Schelew, corporate communication advisor with the city, wrote in an email.\nBannon said he would like to see the sound stop entirely – or at the very least, be turned off at night.\n\"I remember growing up when they used to play classical music really loudly outside of that mall, trying to push people away,\" he said. \"It seems like they stopped, and now they've just upgraded it to a high-pitched screech.\"\nTRENDING 1.

    "title": "Northern Hemisphere’s record winter warmth slashes gas consumption",
    "text": "The northern hemisphere has experienced the warmest winter on record, with the unusual warmth concentrated around the Atlantic Basin, which has produced an enormous surplus of gas and slump in prices since October.\nSurface temperatures on land were +2.65°C above the 20th century average between December and February, according to data compiled by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nChartbook: Northern hemisphere winter 2023/24\nRecord warmth in the winter of 2023/24 beat previous highs of +2.44°C in 2019/2020 and +2.61°C in 2015/16 – also winters characterised by surplus inventories and slump in gas prices.\nGlobal warming, strong El Nino conditions in the Pacific, a strongly positive North Atlantic Oscillation, and the solar activity cycle moving towards its 11-year peak, all contributed to exceptional warmth this winter.\nNORTH AMERICA\nEurope has received most attention because of the regional gas market’s disruption following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the most abnormal weather occurred in North America.\nTemperatures across North America were +3.43°C above the long-run average between December and February (“Climate at a glance”, National Centers for Environmental Information, March 2024).\nNorth America experienced record warm anomalies in both December (+4.66°C) and February (+3.59°C) slashing heating demand for both gas and gas-fired electricity.\nU.S. gas inventories started the heating season just 64 billion cubic feet (bcf) (+2% or +0.24 standard deviations) above the prior 10-year seasonal average on Oct. 1.\nInventories were still only 129 bcf (+4% or +0.46 standard deviations) above the 10-year seasonal average at the end of November.\nBut the surplus had swelled to 307 bcf (+10% or +1.15 standard deviations) by the end of December following a run of abnormally warm weather.\nColder temperatures caused the surplus to narrow temporarily in January, particularly during the very cold spell between Jan. 13 and Jan. 22.\nBut the surplus ballooned again to 519 bcf (+29% or +1.31 standard deviations) by the end of February as temperatures reverted to well above normal.\nWith mild weather continuing into March the surplus had bloated to an enormous 606 bcf (+35 or +1.35 standard deviations) by March 8.\nU.S. front-month futures prices averaged almost $3.19 per million British thermal units in October, putting them in the 13th percentile for all months since 1993 once inflation is taken into account.\nBy February average inflation-adjusted prices had fallen to a record low of $1.80 as persistent warmth and the relentless build up of surplus inventories sent the market into a tailspin.\nEUROPE AND ASIA\nEurope also experienced a very warm winter, with temperatures +2.73°C above the long-run average, making the winter the second warmest on record after 2019/20 (+3.32°C).\nA strongly positive North Atlantic Oscillation directed strong westerly winds into Northwest Europe bringing lots of warm and moisture-laden air from the Atlantic.\nThe temperature anomaly may not have been as extreme as North America, but coupled with prices well above the pre-invasion average, it was enough to leave the region with record seasonal inventories by the end of February.\nInventories across the European Union and the United Kingdom started the heating season 167 terawatt-hours (TWh) (+18% or +1.70 standard deviations) above the 10-year average on Oct. 1.\nBy Feb. 29, the surplus had swollen to 269 TWh (+60% or +2.08 standard deviations), according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe.\nEurope’s front-month futures averaged almost 46 euros per megawatt-hour (88th percentile for all months since 2010 in real terms) in October, but had slumped to an average of just 26 euros (48th percentile) in February.\nBy contrast to North America and Europe, winter temperatures across Asia were closer to normal, at least for the last two decades.\nAsia’s temperatures averaged +1.80°C above the long-term average, but that made it only the 10th warmest winter on record.\nOODLES OF GAS\nNorth America, Europe and Asia combined accounted for almost two-thirds of global gas consumption in 2022 (“Statistical review of world energy”, Energy Institute, 2023).\nNorth America and Europe alone accounted for 40% of worldwide consumption, with a heavy weighting towards the winter months because of heating demand.\nExceptional warmth around the Atlantic Basin in winter 2023/24 therefore occurred in precisely the area to maximise the impact on gas consumption, inventories and prices.\nWhen historians ask why Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions imposed in response did not cause shortages and a more severe and prolonged spike in prices, they are likely to cite extraordinarily warm winters in both 2022/23 and 2023/24 rather than policy actions as the primary reason.\nEurope’s gas consumers got very lucky in the winter of 2023/24 and have seen prices normalise. For the same reason, Asia’s importers are now benefiting from improved availability and much lower prices.\nConversely, North America’s producers have been pushed into a deep slump as they struggle to sell in a market awash with too much gas.\nNext winter is very likely to be colder in North America and Europe.\nIn the meantime, lower prices will result in slower or no production growth in the United States, which should cause the market to tighten gradually over the next 12 months.\nSource: Reuters (Editing by David Evans)\n2024-03-22 hellenicshippingnews...",

    "text": "Workers at Samsung Electronics' southern India plant will remain on strike until their demands for better wages and working conditions are met, union leaders said, as output at the consumer appliances unit was disrupted for a third straight day.The industrial unrest at the plant in Sriperumbudur, near the city of Chennai, is one of the biggest such strikes in recent years in India.The plant, which makes products such as televisions, refrigerators and washing machines, contributes between 20% and 30% of Samsung's annual $12 billion revenue in India, a key growth market for the company.Also Read: New PM E-DRIVE scheme offers ₹ ₹10,000 subsidy for EV 2-wheelers and ₹50,000 for EV 3-wheelers\\\"The strike will continue until a settlement is reached, with the next round of talks (planned) on Friday evening,\\\" union leader E. Muthukumar told Reuters.\\\"As things stand, the strike will continue till Friday.\\\"The Samsung factory is next to units of other global giants such as Foxconn and Dell in an area popular for automobile and electronics manufacturing.On the first day of the strike on Monday, 50% of daily production was disrupted, while 30% was hit on Tuesday as some temporary workers have been roped in to keep production going, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.The workers want Samsung to recognise their union, as well as increase their wages and improve their working hours. Samsung Southwest Asia CEO, JB Park, and other senior executives have travelled to the factory to try to resolve the protests.\\\"They (Samsung) will soon have to talk to us, just like they had to engage with the Korean union there,\\\" Muthukumar said.Also Read: Sonam Kapoor’s father-in-law buys this London property for ₹231.47 croreIn July and August, the 36,500 members of Samsung Electronics' biggest worker union in South Korea demanded higher wages and benefits, striking for several days, but there was no impact on production there.South Korea-based Samsung, which is India's biggest consumer electronics company, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Samsung India said on Monday that it actively engaged with workers \\\"to address any grievances they may have and comply with all laws and regulations\\\".In India, the strike comes ahead of a critical festive season when consumers step up purchases and companies dole out discounts.According to Samsung employees outside the factory, the company has so far not agreed to recognise the union backed by the local labour group, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).Many workers wearing Samsung's blue uniform shirt, and red CITU caps, were seen sitting inside a makeshift tent put up near the factory, which employs roughly 1,800 people.Meals were arranged by workers and being distributed on Wednesday afternoon.Earlier in the morning, employees chanted together outside the factory: \\\"We will stand together and secure a win.\\\"There has been no labour unrest at Samsung's other Indian plant in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which makes smartphones.Also Read: Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch's fresh statement on allegations against her: 'False and malicious'",
