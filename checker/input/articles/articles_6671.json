    "text": "Wisconsin's job market finishes the year on a strong note with record high number of people working [Ricardo Torres](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/4488660002/ricardo-torres/) Wisconsin’s economy ended 2023 in good shape with businesses hiring workers and the state’s unemployment rate at 3.3%, lower than the national average of 3.7%. Jobs and employment data is still being gathered for December. However officials with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development said that in November the state had more than 3 million people working, which is a new high for the state, and in the month 1,700 employees were added to the workforce. In 2023, roughly 32,300 workers entered the workforce in Wisconsin. The biggest problem with the economy has been there aren’t enough bodies to fill the openings. “As the Baby Boomers age out, we find that we need more and more workers just in general,” said Scott Hodek, Section Chief for DWD's Office of Economic Advisors, “This is the big piece that we’re seeing influence the workforce and the economy into the next decades.” More: [These 6 companies laid people off in November in Wisconsin](/story/money/business/2023/12/01/these-6-companies-laid-people-off-in-november-2023-in-wisconsin/71679124007/) Hodek made his comments during the department’s virtual economic briefing in December. “Students, right now graduating, have a great job market,” Hodek said. “We saw we’re getting more people into the labor force, and that’s good, but we need more.” And while the job market is in workers favor, there might be some signs of hiring slowing down. According to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association and Commerce's most recent data from October, Milwaukee metro area employment averaged 862,000, a 0.3% increase from one year ago. “A weakened overall employment trend, as well as negative manufacturing and unemployment indicators, suggest a sluggish metro area economy,” Bret Mayborne, MMAC vice president of economic research, said in the monthly report. “On the positive side, local housing and real estate indicators may be on the mend after registering declines for the better part of two years.” There are still some workers who received bad news this year. In December only one employer filed a WARN notice with the state: Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., based in Brookfield, informed 17 remote workers that they would be laid off beginning Feb. 16. In 2023, 6,727 workers learned they would need to find a new job, which is up from 5,563 a year ago, and up from 2,888 in 2021. But that annual number is a fraction of the 39,756 workers that were laid off in 2020.",

    "text": "Is your Virgo boyfriend acting differently around you?\nDo you suspect that he is being unfaithful behind your back?\nIt’s a tricky situation, especially when you have no evidence of any wrongdoing.\nHopefully, this article can help you through this troubled time. It reveals the most common behavioral clues that a Virgo man will show when he is cheating on his partner.\nHowever, before we get started, I need to tell you about the most effective way to discover what this guy is getting up to.\nThis online communications tracker is able to connect with his personal devices and generate a wealth of data regarding his recent communications.\nYou’ll find out who he has been communicating with the most and how often. If it’s not you, that could be a cause for concern.\nOn top of that, you’ll discover what apps and online services he has been using. Hopefully, there are no dating apps in this list.\nThese are just the main highlights of the extensive report you’ll be delivered once you input a handful of your man’s basic details into this tool.\nMore often than not, it will become abundantly clear if he is up to no good.\nWhat’s more, there is no way for him to find out that he’s being tracked. This tool is completely discreet.\nSo, if you’re sick and tired of speculating in your mind what is going on when you’re not around, click here to download the tool now .\nBelow, we’ll explore the behavioral cues to look out for if you suspect he is being unfaithful.\nContents\nWays To Tell A Virgo Man Is Cheating You will trying to find a way or signs on how do you know if your virgo man is cheating once you realized that he is pretty much changing. By knowing these signs, you can actually look at yourself better and knowing what you need to improve.\nTo help you, I would like to share some information I know. Here are some ways on how do you know if your virgo man is cheating.\n1. He Talks Less Telling your partner ow your day was going, what you have been through, and asking for his advice is one from so many ways to love a virgo man . This kind of act is showing that you care about your partner opinion. Your act for involving your partner in the daily basis means that you are respecting your partner.\nVirgo man is that type of man who will involve you and asking your opinion about the things that he currently doing. He will talk a lot about his business and his current project to you. You know how much he loves talking. So, once he act differently and does not talk to you as much as he used to, you need to ask him why to make it clearer.\n2. He Wants Some Space Sometimes we really need to take a time for ourselves. We can use this time to know ourselves better and everybody will need their own me time. There must be a point where you search on how to tell your boyfriend you need space without hurting his feeling . This is totally okay. But, if you realize, the closer you are to your partner in a relationship, your partner will totally understand that you need your me time. You can just tell him that you want to go for a spa or hangout with your friends and he will let you.\nVirgo man is that type of guy who also need some space for themselves, to play a video game for example. But, once he says that he needs some space in a serious tone, you might want to wonder why. Because no matter how much we want to have our own space and time, we do still care to our loves ones and do not want to leave them for so long.\n3. Appearance Changes At our first relationship or that time back when we want to get close to someone, most of us will try to give our best look for the person that we like. And by the time goes by, when we finally into the relationship and know our partner better, we start to show ourselves, and mostly won't look as attracted as the first time. But, there are also some people who are being real since the very first time.\nBoth are okay, and what you need to notice is that if there is any changes in your partner behavior of paying attention to their appearance. For example, the one who tried to be real, now trying to to look different and better, and vice versa.\nWays To Prevent Your Man From Cheating On You 1. Know What He Want Man want to be a hero to woman. He wants to show how much he loves you and care about you. I know, maybe you want to be that independent woman you always wanted to be. But we are all human, and we need each other. If you are allowing him to enter your life, it means you will also accept him to help you to do things because he cares about you.\n2. Be Open And Honest Everybody make mistakes. And the mistake is made because there was something wrong behind it. There is a possibility where a man is cheating because his partner can't understand him and keep lying to him all the time. You need to understand your connection with your partner better.\nYou will need to see the signs a man is emotionally connected to you so you can start building a better relationship where both of you are open and honest to each other.\n3. Respect And Accept Each Other You do realize that we need to respect our partner even though we already become their partner. Respecting our partner totally has a different meaning with controlling them under our will. As a good woman, you need too see what the man see if yourself showing the signs your girlfriend doesn't respect you enough and what to do so you can respect your partner better.\nThis is the end of today's article about how do you know if your Virgo man is cheating.

    "text": "O Observatório Europeu do Sul (ESO, na sigla em inglês) alertou nesta quinta-feira (9) sobre a ameaça que poderia representar para o funcionamento do observatório Paranal, no norte do Chile, a construção de um projeto para produzir hidrogênio e amoníaco verdes, devido à poluição luminosa.\nOs cientistas acenderam o alerta diante do início da tramitação ambiental de um \"megaprojeto\" para produzir hidrogênio e amoníaco verdes por parte da empresa chilena AES Andes.\nO projeto estaria localizado em Taltal, na região de Antofagasta, a entre cinco e 11 quilômetros de distância de Paranal, que abriga o Very Large Telescope, um dos instrumentos óticos mais poderosos do mundo. Junto dele está sendo construído o Extremely Large Telescope, com capacidade ainda maior.\n\"As emissões de poeira durante a construção, o aumento da turbulência atmosférica e, especialmente, a poluição luminosa, terão um impacto irreparável nas capacidades de observação astronômica\", advertiu o diretor-geral do ESO, Xavier Barcons, em comunicado.\nParanal foi inaugurado em 1999 e fica em pleno deserto de Atacama, o mais árido do mundo e lugar ideal para a observação astronômica por seu clima seco, grande altitude e ausência de nuvens e chuva.\nO complexo é parte da rede de observatórios astronômicos que estão situados no Chile, entre eles o radiotelescópio Alma e o telescópio ótico de La Silla.\nNo fim de dezembro, a companhia AES Andes informou que o projeto inclui \"a produção de hidrogênio e amoníaco verde, bem como o desenvolvimento de energia solar, eólica e de armazenamento em baterias\", em linha com o objetivo do Chile de ampliar a origem renovável de sua matriz energética.\nA AES Andes foi procurada pela AFP, mas não fez comentários.\nPara Itziar de Gregorio, representante do ESO no Chile, \"é crucial considerar localidades alternativas para este megaprojeto que não coloquem em perigo um dos tesouros astronômicos mais importantes do mundo\".\nEm outubro de 2024, entrou em vigor no Chile uma nova regra de luminosidade para proteger lugares próximos aos observatórios, mas também a saúde de pessoas e animais.\nA normativa estabelece limites de luminosidade, horários máximos de funcionamento de telões publicitários, além de promover a transição para o uso de luz quente, que produz menos luminosidade.\npa/atm/rpr",

    "text": "Serie di sinistri in Provincia: tre scontri a San Bernardino, Correggio e Guastalla. Sei persone ricoverate\nUna serie di incidenti si è verificata ieri sulle strade reggiane. Nel tardo pomeriggio, verso le 17, due schianti, quasi contemporaneamente, con cinque persone finite in ospedale .\nIl primo sulla Provinciale tra Guastalla e Novellara, in località San Bernardino, dove all’incrocio con strada della Vittoria si sono scontrate due auto, finite poi per travolgere e abbattere una parte del passaggio a livello. Sul posto ambulanze, autoinfermieristica e polizia locale. Feriti un uomo di 55 anni e la figlia, di Cadelbosco Sopra, a bordo di un Fiat Doblò, oltre a una donna di 36 anni, di Guastalla, che era alla guida di una Fiat Tipo. Dopo le prime cure sono stati portati al Santa Maria Nuova di Reggio, in condizioni di media gravità, non in pericolo di vita. Evidenti i disagi al traffico .\nSchianto fra due auto anche sulla via Campagnola, alle porte di Correggio. Nello scontro tra una Mercedes e una Peugeot 206 sono rimasti feriti due quarantenni: un uomo residente a Correggio e una donna abitante a Carpi. Entrambi sono stati caricati a bordo dell’ambulanza per il trasporto al pronto soccorso di Guastalla, ma non risultano in pericolo di vita. Sul posto anche vigili del fuoco e polizia locale.\nIn mattinata, verso le 6,30, un uomo di 37 anni, residente a Reggio e diretto al lavoro nella Bassa Mantovana, è rimasto ferito in una sbandata in moto, avvenuta alla rotonda all’ingresso di San Rocco a Guastalla. Forse la presenza di uno strato di ghiaia sull’asfalto, oltre a resti di pomodori caduti da qualche camion in transito, hanno favorito la sbandata della moto Ducati Monster, con il centauro che è stato sbalzato oltre il guard rail. È stato portato dall’ambulanza della Croce rossa al pronto soccorso di Guastalla con traumi non gravi.\nAntonio Lecci\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",
