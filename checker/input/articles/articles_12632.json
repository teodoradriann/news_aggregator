Sport 1 day ago Thabang Monare and Zakhele Lepasa did not make the team while Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker started with Jayden Adams who is the only player in his team going to Afcon.\nThe other surprise by Riveiro was that he started exciting teenager Relebohile Mofokeng on the bench while improving Karim Kimvuidi was paired with Makgopa to lead the attack.\nPirates started on the offensive with Patrick Maswanganyi and Phillip Ndlondlo initiating most of their attacks but they were led down in the final third by Makgopa, Deon Hotto and Kimvuidi.\nStellenbosch also had their moments on the attack but the likes of Rayners, Titus and Adams could not get the better of Pirates goalkeeper Melusi Buthelezi.\nPirates took the lead after 32 minutes when defender Xoki sent Stellenbosch goalkeeper Sage Stephens the wrong way from the penalty spot after Thabelo Moloisane was handled the ball in the box.\nPirates increased their lead after 58 minutes when Makgopa produced a moment of brilliance with a cheeky back heel flick to beat Stephens after he connected with a cross from Fortune Makaringe.\n‘He’s got our blessings’, says Safa on Foster’s reasons for skipping Afcon South African Football Association CEO Lydia Monyepao says they gave their blessings to Lyle Foster when he asked to be excused from playing for ... Sport 15 hours ago Stellenbosch launched a spirited fightback with Rayners, Devon Titus and De Jong finding the back of the net during a frantic period of the match between the 66th and 78th minutes to secure the vital three points.\nFor the late goals, Stellenbosch the Pirates defence that went to sleep as they completed a league double over the Buccaneers.\nIn the earlier kickoff on Friday, AmaZulu moved to seventh spot on the DStv Premiership standings with a dominant 3-0 win over struggling Royal AM at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.\nAmaZulu, who may be kicked out of the top eight by Polokwane City, Golden Arrows or Moroka Swallows below them on the log, ensured this vital victory through first half goals by Mlondi Mbanjwa and a brace frpm Augustine Kwem.\nMbanjwa took the lead after 13 minutes and Kwem found the back of the net on the 27th and 32nd minutes to leave Royal AM in the danger zone and with a mountain to climb to revive their season.\nThe talking point of this match was Royal AM starting the match with club chairman Andile Mpisane who was replaced at half time as they tried to come back in the game.\nSupport independent journalism.

    "title": "Physics, math undergrad Isa Fite named a 2024 Goldwater Scholar",
    "text": "The University of Tulsa is pleased to announce that Maria Isabelle “Isa” Fite, a second-year student majoring in [physics](https://utulsa.edu/academics/health-natural-sciences/departments/physics-engineering-physics/) and applied [math](https://utulsa.edu/academics/engineering-computer-science/departments/mathematics/) from Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been awarded a [2024 Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/). This prestigious award recognizes exceptional undergraduates studying science, engineering, and/or math disciplines. “The Goldwater Scholarship provides a level of respect in the scientific community,” said Fite, one of only 508 college students in the United States to receive the award this year. “We are enormously proud of Isa and her accomplishments,” said TU President Brad R. Carson. “The University of Tulsa’s science, technology, engineering, and math programs are highly regarded. We also root all students in the arts and humanities to ensure well-rounded alumni and offer an enlightening Honors College experience that attracts students of Isa’s caliber.” Fite thanked her faculty mentors, Applied Professor of Physics [Jerry McCoy](https://utulsa.edu/people/jerry-mccoy/) and Warren Foundation Chair in Bioinformatics [Brett McKinney](https://utulsa.edu/people/brett-mckinney/), a theoretical physicist, for setting her up for success. As a high school student, she attended TU’s monthly [Physics Journal Club](https://utulsa.edu/news/common-passion-unites-diverse-minds-in-physics-journal-club/) meetings, organized by McCoy. He invited her to participate in an independent study of particle physics. When Fite was just 17, she was sitting in on research presentations by TU seniors and was thrilled to find that the university students and faculty took her seriously despite the fact that she had not yet finished high school. “I took note of the understanding Isa displayed in discussing physics concepts such as wave-particle duality and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, even though she had not yet taken foundational coursework in these areas,” McCoy said. “She frequently goes well beyond efforts other students might make to understand a subject. For example … she currently takes classes in German out of a desire to read Heisenberg, Einstein, Minkowski, and others in their original language. “As Isa continues to challenge her intellectual gifting, she will distinguish herself as one of the very brightest – if not the brightest – students with whom I have had the privilege to work.” While she applied to other prestigious universities, Fite said, “TU was the best place I could have been,” citing the relationships she has developed with faculty and graduate students and the opportunities to excel in her chosen field. Upon arriving on campus in fall 2022, Fite joined the [Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge](https://utulsa.edu/research/research-opportunities/turc/) (TURC) to formally begin pursuing her academic dreams. “The TURC program was instrumental,” she said. “Isabelle joined my research group at the end of her first year to start dabbling in quantum theory, and before I knew it, she was contributing to real theoretical physics problems. She is currently working on a manuscript describing a method for calculating the properties of vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates in D dimensions. Next, we plan to use this model to study black holes,” McKinney said. “It has been a joy to mentor Isabelle, a most deserving Goldwater Scholar.” Fite serves as the Oxley College of Health & Natural Science’ delegate to the TURC Student Advisory Committee, advising administrators on policies and events from a student perspective as well as helping plan TURC events. She is a member of the TU Honors Program and president of the university’s Wesley Foundation Student Council. Fite also thanked Terrie Shipley, TU’s director of national fellowships, for assisting with the rigorous Goldwater application process.

    "title": "‘We beat Big Pharma’: President Biden, Bernie Sanders tout drug pricing reform",
    "text": "Drug pricing will remain a key issue throughout the 2024 presidential campaign and President Joe Biden is already starting to hit the topic hard to gain favor with voters.\nTo that end, Biden teamed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, (I-VT), on Wednesday to outline the White House’s latest drug pricing reform accomplishments.\nThe partnership of one-time Democratic presidential rivals also served as a push from the party’s leading voices to implement additional policies aimed at lowering drug costs even further.\nFront and center at the joint press conference was the recent decision by several major drugmakers — including AstraZeneca, GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim — to cap their inhalers at $35 a month starting in June.\nThe manufacturers announced the move after Sanders led a group of Senate Democrats in\nwriting a letter to pharma CEOs in January, demanding they lower the cost of inhalers for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.\nLast month, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot noted in a statement that the drugmaker agreed to cap the cost of inhalers to build on its commitment to address barriers to access and affordability for patients living with respiratory diseases.\n“We remain dedicated to addressing the need for affordability of our medicines, but the system is complex and we cannot do it alone,” Soriot added. “It is critical that Congress bring together key stakeholders to help reform the healthcare system so patients can afford the medicines they need, not just today, but for the future.”\nIn his speech, Biden pointed out that an inhaler costs $49 in the U.K., compared to $645 in the U.S.\n“The last few weeks, some of the big drug companies have gotten the message to reduce the prices for some asthma drugs,” Biden said. “There’s some progress going on… But it’s about time.”\nDemocrats united against healthcare costs\nFour years after Biden and Sanders ran against one another in the Democratic primaries in 2020, the two have put their differences aside to push an issue that has become increasingly bipartisan — the high cost of healthcare in the U.S.\nSanders, who heads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee, made\ndrug pricing one of his top priorities during the past year.\nRecently, he threatened to subpeona the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson and Merck in order to get them to testify in Congress about high drug costs.\n“Our nation is politically divided — nobody doubts that,” Sanders said in his remarks. “But there is one issue that the American people — whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents; whether they’re conservative or progressive — are united on. And that is that we are sick and tired of paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.”\nDid Biden beat Big Pharma?\nFollowing Sanders’ comments, Biden proceeded to claim victory over Big Pharma, noting that he was proud his administration has taken on the pharma industry “in the most significant ways ever.”\n“[Bernie] and I have been fighting this for 25 years,” Biden said. “Finally, we beat Big Pharma. Finally.”\nWhile total victory over the pharma industry may be an exaggeration, the Biden administration was responsible for what was arguably the most significant drug pricing reform in years — the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — in 2022.\nThe IRA’s drug pricing provisions included giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of certain Part D drugs, as well as capping the cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 a month.\nThis year, the Medicare negotiation process kicked off, with all pharma companies of the first 10 drugs selected agreeing to participate in the program.\nIn February, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nset its initial price offers for those 10 drugs — and negotiations with drugmakers will determine a maximum fair price by August 1.\nEarlier this week, the Biden administration said it has responded to offers from the manufacturers of the drugs selected for pricing negotiations, but provided no details.\nThe new drug prices for the 10 drugs — including therapies manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb — will go into effect in 2026.\nNext year, the federal government is set to choose another 15 drugs to have their prices negotiated by Medicare.\nBiden backs IRA’s impact\nIn his speech, Biden emphasized that the Medicare negotiation program is slated to reduce the federal deficit by $160 billion — adding that his administration will attempt to increase the number of negotiated drugs to 50 per year.\n“I think we should be more aggressive,” he said. “It’s time to negotiate lower prices for at least 50 drugs a year. [I]f we move that number up, we’ll save taxpayers another $200 billion on top of the $160 billion, because Medicare will not be paying these exorbitant costs.”\nWhether the program will save patients money, however, is still up in the air.\nBiden went on to argue that while he was a capitalist, he believes capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism, calling it “exploitation.” He also singled out efforts by the pharma industry to stifle generic competition in order to preserve profits for brand name drugs.\n“When Big Pharma doesn’t play by the rules, competitors can’t offer lower prices for generic drugs and devices that carry medication, so prices are raised artificially,” Biden said. “I thank Bernie for leading the charge to do something about this.”\nBiden also touted recent efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to crack down on the pharma industry, including targeting sham patents in the Food and Drug Administration’s so-called “Orange Book.”\nIn the last year, the FTC has pinpointed several Big Pharma companies over their\nwrongfully listed patents that can contribute to higher prices and undermine generic competition.",
