    "text": "The Sunday Mail\nTHERE is growing consensus that the El Niño weather phenomenon, which was largely expected to induce drought in this part of the world, would not be as severe as initially projected.\nThe generous rains received since the beginning of the year are lifting spirits and raising expectations of better-than-expected harvests in agriculture.\nDecent harvests would not only guarantee both household and national food security, but drive the country’s economy and add impetus to the overall objective of Vision 2030, which is premised on creating a highly industrialised and prosperous country that enjoys high standards of living.\nIt must be remembered that the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion upwardly reviewed the economic growth estimate to 5,5 percent in 2023 on account of record production in wheat and tobacco, among others.\nLest we get ahead of ourselves, it is important to note that no one knows for sure how the season will pan out.\nBut what we know is that the best way to build the future is to create it.\nClearly, Zimbabwe has done the best it can to make its own luck.\nWhile we have made significant strides to wean ourselves from rain-fed agriculture, the adoption of conservation farming methods has been hugely rewarding.\nMost encouragingly, our farmers, through their experiences over past cropping seasons, have realised that climate-proofing agriculture — through Pfumvudza/Intwasa — is the sure way forward, especially in the wake of climate change.\nFor example, during the 2023/2024 summer cropping season, farmers have doubled their Pfumvudza plots to 11,3 million, up from 5,5 million a year earlier.\nThe increase in the hectarage under irrigation has also allayed fears and anxieties that come with relying on the rains.\nBut there have been concerted and targeted efforts to promote seed that is specific to the country’s agro-ecological regions as well as short-season varieties and traditional grain.\nOverall, all these interventions are designed to temper the impact of adverse weather conditions.\nThe importance of the agriculture sector cannot be overemphasised as it is the lifeblood of our economy.\nIt is the sun around which our lives revolve.\nIt provides sustenance for most of our farmers who live in rural areas and supplies the much-needed feedstock to industry, which is currently on a growth path.\nIt also ensures the health of the country’s finances through cutting imports.\nSo, a good outturn in agriculture, which is a corollary of good rains, would likely put the country’s ambitious plan to establish an upper middle-income economy by 2030 back on the rails.\nPresident Mnangagwa has already expressed his desire to achieve the set targets ahead of time.\nWithout the distractions that come with having to deal with an emergency related to drought, the country can better invest its energy and resources in development.\nThe recent rains are also lifting expectations that we might get decent water allocations from Kariba to generate the electricity needed to power our economy.\nA recent report from the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), which manages water in the river on behalf of both Zimbabwe and Zambia, indicated that, despite the late onset of the rainy season, the water level at Lake Kariba had risen to 477,35 metres as of January 2, compared to 475 metres in the same period a year ago.\nThe increase was attributed to increased rainfall activity in the catchment.\n“The lake level is rising due to increased rainfall activity on the lake and immediate catchment, closing the period under review at 477,25m (12,11 percent usable storage) on 2nd January 2024, compared to 475,63m (0,97 percent usable storage) recorded during the same date last year,” said ZRA then.\nWith the new Hwange Power Station’s Unit 7 and 8 now consistently feeding 600MW into the national grid, it means prospects of long hours of loadshedding are dim.\nSo, this year might turn out to be better than what some people would have us believe.\nWe must keep believing and stay the course to achieve the future that we all want and deserve.",

    "title": "Wyden blocks Trump's CISA boss nominee over 'cover up' • The Register",
    "text": "Uncle Sam's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, aka CISA, has been \"actively hiding information\" about American telecommunications networks' weak security for years, according to Senator Ron Wyden.\nThe Oregon Democrat said he will block the nomination of Sean Plankey to lead the agency until CISA releases an unclassified 2022 report on the matter.\nWyden, a senior member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been urging CISA to make public the report , \"US Telecommunications Insecurity 2022,\" since July of that year. And while the cyber-agency finally allowed Wyden's staff to read the missive in 2023, the full document has yet to be disclosed to the public.\nIn a statement to The Register , Wyden said he personally asked Jen Easterly to release the document during a phone call last February. However, the then-CISA director \"continued to stonewall my requests until she left office.\"\nWyden also wrote a letter to then-President Joe Biden in February 2024 about flaws in American communications networks that foreign governments are understood to be exploiting to remotely spy on and monitor people's wireless devices.\nThe vulnerabilities exist in that old chestnut, Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) and its pal Diameter, which are protocols used by fixed and mobile network operators to interconnect their networks.\nThese protocols' security weaknesses have been known for years , and allow snoops breaking into telcos or rogue insiders to hijack surveillance targets' text messages and calls and monitor their whereabouts. Wyden wants to see some form of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US wireless carriers to ensure spies aren't abusing SS7 and Diameter implementations to silently keep tabs on Americans via their cellphones.\n\"Surveillance companies and their authoritarian foreign government customers have exploited lax security in US and foreign phone networks for at least a decade to track phones anywhere in the world,\" Wyden said in the 2024 letter to Biden.\nUntil CISA ends its \"multi-year cover up of the phone companies' negligent cybersecurity\" – which Wyden also blames for the Salt Typhoon intrusions during which Beijing's spies were in a position to get their hands on millions of citizens' call records, internet activities, and private texts – the senator said he won't let Plankey's nomination move forward.\n\"Congress and the American people have a right to read this report, and until CISA releases it, I must object to this nomination,\" Wyden said.\nA CISA spokesperson declined to comment.\nPresident Donald Trump last month nominated Plankey to be CISA Director, who needs to be confirmed by the Senate before he can assume the leadership role.\nUnder Senate rules any one lawmaker can place an unlimited hold on a federal nominee, and this type of blockage can be used as leverage against the executive branch.\nWyden pulled a similar maneuver in 2018, blocking the nomination of Trump's first CISA lead, Chris Krebs, until Homeland Security agreed to hand over information about surveillance on American's mobile devices. ®\nCISA-note Speaking of the cyber-agency, President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order stripping any security clearances from former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and ex-CISA boss Chris Krebs, and directing the Dept of Justice to investigate the pair .\nTrump is still upset that Krebs said, correctly, the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost, was won fair and square by Joe Biden, with no outside interference in the process.\nGet our Tech Resources",

    "text": "A psychiatrist and professor of anthropology of over 40 years, Arthur M. Kleinman studies patient-caregiver relationships in Asia. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nFM: Your Gen Ed course “Who lives, Who dies, Who cares? Reimagining Global Health” has been a foundational course for many students at Harvard interested in public health and medicine. What’s a lesson from the course that you hope that all Harvard students take away from their undergraduate education?\nAMK: If you’re looking at a health problem or a social problem, history and the study of contemporary lived experience are crucial for figuring out how to first analyze such problems and then organize interventions. Everything from the treatment of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in very poor countries or poor parts of our own country, to the mental health field, and how to respond to depression in pregnancy, to depression amongst the elderly, to dementia, to stigma, etc. All those things require both a historical understanding of where the problems came from, a big social theory understanding of what social forces have intensified the problems and made the solutions more complicated, and also an understanding of what kinds of projects work and which ones don’t work, and what are the reasons for that.\nFM: Why do you like to work with undergraduate students?\nAMK: In my view, they’re the most exciting students to work with because they bring not only enormous energy, but considerable idealism — a desire to rethink old problems in such a way to do something about them — and a commitment to get out and do things.\nFM: Paul Farmer, the renowned medical anthropologist who died very suddenly two years ago, was a student and later a close colleague of yours. You worked very closely on global health projects and co-taught several courses here at Harvard. How do you think his legacy will live on in the field?\nAMK: Paul was the icon of global health. He demonstrated, really for the first time, that you could deliver high technology interventions to poor people in ways that could be funded and supported and that had remarkable outcomes.\nPaul also critiqued the willingness that we often have on the public health side to accept scarcity as a rationale for doing nothing or very little. He challenged that. He said we were socialized for scarcity, and we could always, he thought, mobilize support, whether it was local or had to come from external sources. He was simply an amazing figure.\nHis loss was totally unexpected, and really, very difficult for many of us. For me, he was an extremely close friend. Whereas I started mentoring him, he ended up mentoring me.\nAdvertisement FM: You conducted research in China and Taiwan for multiple years. Why did you find China and Taiwan to be the best place to explore questions of culture and health?\nAMK: My wife was a China scholar. Because of her interests and background, we went to Taiwan, first in 1969, and to China, first in 1978. We had this cultural-linguistic connection.\nWhen I went to Taiwan in 1969, no one had really studied the Taiwan healthcare system, and that gave me an opportunity to describe it from an anthropological perspective that was quite different from a public health perspective, and therefore to surprise people.\nI went on to look at mental health problems, and that’s what I did in China. Because of the medical focus, I was allowed to do things in China that probably you wouldn’t have been allowed to do if you had if you didn’t have that medical focus. For example, I did the first study by a foreigner of the survivors of China’s Cultural Revolution in 1980, just four years after the Cultural Revolution ended.\nI’m continuing to do my research in China. I have a wonderful project called Social Technology for Global Aging. It emphasizes studies of elder care in the Chinese setting, bringing technology, design, public health, engineering, and medicine together. We’re looking at how if you put anthropologists together with engineers and medical people, and they have a focus on practically assisting people who are elderly, how they can come up with both technological solutions and social solutions and put them together.\nFM: Why is aging something that you’re interested in after so much work in mental health?\nAMK: I’m going to be 83 years of age in March, so it’s highly appropriate for me to be interested in aging. I’m in the aging process myself, but also it’s an immense problem, in East Asia especially, but also here in the United States.\nIn East Asia, Japan is leading the way. In 2050, an unprecedented 40 percent of Japanese will be over 65 years of age. There’s never been a society in the world like that, so what kind of society will that be? How will they keep going? 30 percent of Chinese will be over 65 in 2050. Today, for every retiree in China, there are about four workers. In 2050, there’ll be one and a half workers for every retiree. It’s probably an unsustainable Social Security system. What will happen? There’ll have to be fundamental changes in the ages when people retire, etc.\nIt’s very hard in the United States to read good things about China today, because Chinese and US relations have become so fraught. But point-of-fact, aging is an area where the Chinese are doing some really interesting things.\nFM: You mentioned that Chinese cuisine was something that is a really amazing part of getting to travel so much. What’s your favorite dish?\nAdvertisement AMK: When I go to Shanghai, my former students, who are now all professors in Beijing or Shanghai, know that I am addicted to something that’s called xiao long bao, little dragon dumplings. I restrict myself to six a day when I’m in Shanghai, and everyone laughs when I use my chopsticks to grab a seventh. People stop me. That’s one of my favorites.\nFM: Your most recent book, “The Soul of Care,” published in 2019, part-memoir, part-manifesto about your work, was a deeply-personal account of your experience as a caregiver. How did you open up to sharing this part of your life and relationship?\nAMK: You can’t write this kind of book when you’re young. I’ve done many other things in the course of my career that have testified to my academic status. I felt that I needed to tell this story because I had the personal experience of taking care of my late wife, Joan, for 10 and a half years while she suffered from early onset Alzheimer’s disease and died from it. That experience was transformative for me. I thought I knew everything about illness and care. I realized that I had a hell of a lot to learn. What is it to take care of someone who you love with a terrible disease?\nAt the same time, I could use the memoir of my own care and put it together with my research on caregiving — well, you call it a manifesto, I don’t quite see it that way — as a critique of what’s happening in our society with caregiving today, which I think is in a terrible situation. Its implications for care are simply profound.\nI came to the conclusion that we never measure care because if we measured care, we’d have to measure the quality of doctor- and nurse-patient relationships, we’d have to measure family-based care, communication, support, activities like clinical judgment and prescribing patterns. Most of this we don’t study. We know very little about the quality of care, and what we do know is not so promising. What we do is a sleight of hand: substituting institutional efficiency for the quality of care, and that’s an unacceptable substitution.\nFM: Why do you think it was important to be vulnerable about your own experience caring for your wife to talk about these issues within the healthcare system?\nAMK: I felt that if I didn’t tell the story the way it is, then people would not relate to what I wanted to say about care. Care gets at something so fundamentally human.\nThe book is really a love story. I had a fantastic relationship with my wife. Even during the 10 terrible years of caring for her, we had a very close relationship.\nThe musician Leonard Cohen, in his various songs, writes that we’re all broken, and it’s the breaks in us that let the light in, give us insight into things and make us aware of our world, and improve our sensitivity to others. I think that’s really true. I came out of a background in a lifestyle where I was accustomed to never showing that I was vulnerable. That was an impossibility with caring for Joan. I began to realize that being vulnerable, and others being aware of my vulnerabilities actually made for a more authentic world.\nFM: One of the most important characters in your story is your home health aide, who you write about under a pseudonym. Why did you feel it was necessary to include her in the book?\nAdvertisement AMK: I don’t think I could have been a caregiver for 10 years for my wife without a home health aide who happened to have a terrific relationship with my wife and take some of the pressure off of me. We joked about it, the home health aide and I, that she worked five days 9-to-5, and I worked 5-to-9 and weekends. If I didn’t have the ability to come to class, teach, do my research, I couldn’t have survived those 10 years.\nIn the last nine months, I could no longer take care of Joan because her needs were greater than any of the skills I had to help. She went into a nursing home. My adult children and I looked at 22 nursing homes in the Cambridge area, and 10 of them made us cry. It was so terrible. Finally we found a great one, but even there, the relationship that one has to a nursing home, in Joan’s case, the cognitive care unit, is very complicated.\nI remember I broke down when I couldn’t care for my wife any longer. It was a terrible experience bringing her to a clinical facility. I wanted to abscond with her; I had this fantasy of grabbing her and running away. I felt defeated, disappointed, frustrated. But that was nothing compared to what she was going through.\nFM: At the end of the book, you talked very candidly about the funeral ceremony your family held for Joan just a few miles away at Mount Auburn Cemetery, and also the ritual of visiting her grave site. Readers get to know Joan very closely through “The Soul of Care,” so in some ways, she lives on through the book. What other ways do you see her memory live on?\nAMK: She taught me so many things. My wife was an elegant woman who knew how to enrich everyday life and make a simple dinner into a celebration. She made me a different person. She provided my moral education, she made me more sensitive to others, she made me a better human being — still with my own problems, but better than I was. She enriched my life immensely. She took care of me for 36 years, so my 10 years was hardly sufficient to repay it.\nFM: One puzzling aspect of clinical education is that first-year medical students consistently score higher than fourth year students on their ability to empathize with their patients. What aspect of medical education contributes to this paradox and what should be done to improve it?\nAMK: There’s no question about the fact that there’s something toxic in medical education. There’s no reason why medical students, while they’re mastering science and technology, shouldn’t also be improving in the area of empathy and the psychosocial aspects of care. But they’re not. What are we doing that’s wrong? It has a lot to do with the healthcare system, a healthcare system that has put efficiency in first place, that is really profit-driven, and that has a vision of doctors as being able to increase this “throughput” to improve both efficiency and profits.\nFM: There’s a long history of physician-writers, from Anton Chekhov writing in Russia in the 19th century to today’s popular health writers like Siddhartha Mukherjee and Danielle Ofri. Who is one author you look up to?\nAMK: Medicine brings you into people’s stories. You enter a space of their illness experience, and you see things that normally you wouldn’t see or hear about. It’s an enormous privilege. Physicians have these stories and want to do something with them, so quite a number transmute them into fiction and art. We have physicians at HMS who are painters, sculptors, musicians, novelists, and writers of nonfiction.\nI know that there’s a literary tradition, and I contributed to it myself, but I think the real value of patient stories is what a great Harvard professor of an earlier age, William James — himself a physician, though he never practiced professionally — described. He saw himself as a physician to the country, to the world. James thought that knowledge was gained from experience. He called it radical empiricism: all knowledge, he felt, came out of experience and should go back into experience to inform how we live as a source of wisdom. That’s what I’m gonna talk about this afternoon, in my lecture for my “Quests for Wisdom” course.\nAdvertisement — Associate Magazine Editor Dina R.

    "text": "A handout picture by Venezuela's government shows President Nicolas Maduro (C) delivering a speech in Caracas before members of the country's armed forces on December 28, 2023 - Copyright Venezuelan Presidency/AFP Zurimar Campos Javier TOVAR, Esteban ROJAS Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in a “defensive” exercise near the border with Guyana, in response to Britain sending a warship to the area.\nMaduro said he was launching “a joint action of a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country.”\nBritain said Sunday it would divert the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, a former British colony, amid the South American country’s simmering territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region.\nA Guyana foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that the ship was due to arrive Friday and would be in its territory for “less than a week” for open sea defense exercises. The ship will not dock in Georgetown.\nThe television broadcast accompanying Maduro’s announcement showed fighter jets participating in the Venezuelan exercise, as well as ships and ocean patrol vessels.\nThe Venezuelan government earlier asked Guyana, in a statement, “to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the HMS Trent, and to refrain from involving military powers in the territorial controversy.”\nGuyana’s vice president Bharrat Jagdeo said the country was not doing anything to threaten Venezuela.\n“A lot of these measures were long-planned and they are routine and they are part of our building a defensive capability,” he told a press conference.\n“We don’t plan on invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and he need not have any worry about that.”\n– ‘We are warriors’ –\nMaduro claims that Essequibo — which makes up about two-thirds of Guyana’s territory — is actually Venezuelan land, a decades-old contention that has flared since massive oil deposits were found in its waters.\nThe rising tensions have raised fears in the region of a potential conflict over the remote area of 160,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles).\nThe South American neighbors agreed earlier this month not to resort to force to settle the dispute, during a meeting between Maduro and Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali.\n“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,” said Maduro.\n“But no one should threaten Venezuela, no one should mess with Venezuela. We are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,” he said.\n“The threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.”\nA UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated sovereign borders “must be respected” and that London would work internationally “to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld.”\nMaduro’s government held a controversial referendum on December 3 in which 95 percent of voters, according to officials in the hard-line leftist government, supported declaring Venezuela the rightful owner of Essequibo.\nHe has since started legal maneuvers to create a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to issue licenses for extracting crude in the region.\nGuyana’s Ali has branded the moves a “grave threat to international peace and security.”",

    "text": "Cartas al director La bondad y resiliencia de Jesús Navas En el mundo del fútbol, pocos jugadores alcanzan el estatus de leyenda. Jesús Navas, icono del Sevilla FC, no solo ha brillado en el campo, sino que también ha demostrado una humanidad y generosidad que trascienden el deporte. Este artículo celebra su carrera, su capacidad para superar adversidades y su entrega altruista, impulsada por su profunda fe cristiana. La carrera de Jesús Navas no ha estado exenta de desafíos. Desde sus primeros días en el Sevilla FC, Navas mostró un talento extraordinario, pero también se enfrentó a crisis personales que amenazaron con desviar su trayectoria. Uno de los momentos más difíciles de su vida profesional fue su lucha contra la ansiedad, un problema que lo apartó temporalmente de las competiciones internacionales. Con valentía y determinación, Navas trabajó arduamente para superar sus miedos, apoyado por su familia, compañeros y su fe inquebrantable. Tras su recuperación, Navas regresó al campo con una renovada pasión y demostró que podía enfrentarse a cualquier adversidad. Su dedicación y esfuerzo lo llevaron a conquistar títulos importantes con el Sevilla FC, incluyendo varias Copas del Rey y la UEFA Europa League. Su capacidad para resurgir de las dificultades no solo inspiró a sus compañeros, sino también a miles de aficionados que vimos en él un ejemplo de resiliencia y perseverancia. La bondad de Jesús Navas no se limita a sus hazañas deportivas. Conocido por su humildad, recientemente, decidió antes de su retirada donar la totalidad de su sueldo a una fundación benéfica. Navas ha manifestado en múltiples ocasiones que su motivación para superar las dificultades proviene de su fe en Dios y en su familia: «Todo lo que tengo se lo debo a Dios, y a mi familia», ha declarado Navas, subrayando cómo su fe guía sus decisiones tanto dentro como fuera del campo. La fe cristiana de Jesús Navas es una parte integral de su vida y su carrera. Desde niño, fue educado en los valores cristianos. Navas ha encontrado siempre consuelo y fortaleza en su fe. A través de su ejemplo, Navas ha demostrado que el éxito deportivo y la fe pueden ir de la mano, y que la verdadera grandeza se encuentra en el servicio a los demás. Jesús Navas es, sin duda, una leyenda del Sevilla FC. Su habilidad en el campo es solo una parte de su legado. Su capacidad para superar adversidades personales, y su profunda fe cristiana lo convierten en un modelo a seguir, no solo para los aficionados del fútbol, sino para todos aquellos que valoran la bondad y la entrega. En un mundo donde las figuras públicas a menudo son juzgadas solo por su éxito profesional, Navas nos recuerda que el verdadero heroísmo reside en la capacidad de salir adelante y apoyar a los demás. Su vida y carrera son un testimonio de que, con fe y determinación, es posible superar cualquier obstáculo.",
