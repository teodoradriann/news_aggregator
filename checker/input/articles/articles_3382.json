    "text": "A equipe sub-22 do Mogi das Cruzes viu a classificação para a Série Ouro da Liga de Desenvolvimento de Basquete (LDB) escapar na última rodada da segunda etapa disputada no domingo passado, em São Paulo, mesmo vencendo o Brasília.\nOs mogianos terminaram a fase de classificação no quinto lugar do Grupo A, com nove vitórias em 12 rodadas, mesma campanha de Cruzeiro (3º) e Minas (4º), que avançaram à decisão principal do torneio. No desempate, o Mogi perdeu no saldo de cestas (4, contra saldo de -4).\n1 de 2 Alexandre Rios técnico do sub-22 do Mogi Basquete — Foto: Suelenn Ladessa/Mogi Basquete Alexandre Rios técnico do sub-22 do Mogi Basquete — Foto: Suelenn Ladessa/Mogi Basquete\nO técnico Alexandre Rios fez uma avaliação da participação na etapa de classificação do brasileiro de base. Segundo o comandante, as oscilações ao longo das etapas pesaram na conta do time.\n– Acho que tivemos algumas etapas um pouco diferentes uma da outra. A primeira etapa exigiu um pouquinho mais da gente. Fizemos bons jogos e estávamos um pouco mais concentrados para a primeira etapa. Perdemos dois jogos, mas para equipes que são tão fortes quanto a nossa.\n– Na segunda etapa, algumas mudanças, um pouco de falta de concentração em alguns jogos, e um jogo muito mal que não podíamos perder (derrota na segunda janela para o Minas por 90 a 73). Tem alguns jogos que você tem que ganhar e outros que não pode perder. Esse jogo, acho que custou para nós a classificação. Tivemos três derrotas. Esse foi, acho, o nosso pior jogo dessa fase, e uma equipe que estava muito mais motivada e veio com muito mais garra que a nossa para conseguir a classificação. Fizemos um jogo ruim, e isso nos custou a ida para a chave ouro. A chave ouro é composta por times fortes. Merecíamos estar lá, mas não fizemos por onde – analisou Alexandre.\nCom o quinto lugar, o Mogi vai disputar o título da Série Prata, que terá sede em Caxias do Sul, no Rio Grande do Sul. A equipe integra o Grupo E, que também conta com Botafogo, São Paulo e Brasília. A chave F é formada por Caxias, Cetaf, LDPG e Thalia/Smeij.\n2 de 2 Mogi vai disputar título da Série Prata da LDB — Foto: Suelenn Ladessa/Mogi Basquete Mogi vai disputar título da Série Prata da LDB — Foto: Suelenn Ladessa/Mogi Basquete\nDe acordo com o regulamento, as equipes vão jogar entre si apenas uma vez no próprio grupo. Os dois primeiros das chaves avançam para os confrontos das semifinais. Os vencedores das semifinais vão se enfrentar na decisão, enquanto os perdedores disputam o 3º e 4º lugar. Os jogos serão disputados entre os dias 24 e 29 de agosto.\n– Agora, na chave prata, times de boa qualidade que também passaram nos jogos que fizemos. Espero que a gente faça um bom resultado e que consiga aprender com o erro de não termos ido para a chave ouro. Acho que merecíamos estar lá, mas volto a dizer que é preciso fazer por onde. Tem boas equipes, e acredito que temos tudo para fazer uma boa campanha na chave prata – concluiu o técnico.\nLeia mais notícias do esporte do Alto Tietê",

    "title": "Air travellers lament as Abuja-Ilorin one-way ticket hits N380,000 - Daily Trust",
    "text": "Air travellers in Kwara State have raised concerns over the rising cost of flight tickets on the Ilorin route, which many say have become unjustifiably higher than fares on longer routes such as Lagos to Abuja.\nPassengers and stakeholders say the development is affecting mobility, economic activities, and access to the state, especially as cancellations and flight delays continue to compound the problem.\nAlhaji AbdulAzeez, a regular air traveller, told Daily Trust on Tuesday that a one-way ticket from Ilorin to Abuja now sells for as high as N250,000 to N290,000, especially on weekends or Monday mornings.\nSPONSOR AD This is a sharp rise from the previous average of N65,000 to N100,000 for the same journey.\n “In contrast, Lagos to Abuja flights, which take longer on air, go for around N120,000 to N150,000. Sometimes even less,” he said.\nOn his part, another passenger who simply identified himself as Nurudeen also lamented the situation.\n “What this means is that Ilorin passengers are paying almost double the price for a shorter flight. Yet they are still at the mercy of delays, sudden cancellations, or flight rescheduling without refunds.\n“Sometimes you are left stranded with no compensation and forced to consider the risky and time-consuming road journey,” he added.\nHe further explained that operators often cite operational, technical, or administrative reasons for disruptions, leaving passengers in uncertainty. “No reasonable passenger wants to board a flight with safety issues. But they use these excuses and passengers have no choice but to accept because of the fear of crashing,” he said.\n Nurudeen further decried frequent flight diversions, which he said were sometimes due to increased traffic at other airports, further punishing passengers on the Ilorin route.\n The matter has also drawn the attention of lawmakers. Hon Rukayat Shittu, a member of the Kwara State House of Assembly, recently raised the issue at plenary, calling for urgent action to address what she described as an unfair pricing system.\nIn a Facebook post on the matter, the lawmaker said the Ilorin airfare crisis hurts the masses and hampers development in the state.\n“Air connectivity is no longer a luxury. It is a public good like roads, electricity, or education,” she wrote.\n“When ticket prices in Ilorin are unfairly higher than similar routes in other states, the poorest suffer the most. Artisans, market women, hotel workers, and transporters lose income when fewer people fly into Kwara. Students and young professionals miss out on opportunities. Small businesses lose clients and investors skip Kwara due to high cost and poor accessibility,” she added.\nShittu urged aviation stakeholders and regulators to review the pricing structure for Ilorin and ensure it reflects fairness, accessibility, and economic relevance.\nAs of the time of filing this report yesterday, a one-way flight from Abuja-Ilorin on Overland Airways has ballooned to N380,000 for July 17 flight (today) and N300,000 for the following day.\nThe cheapest fares quoted by the airline are N160,000 while for other days of the week, the fares are between N200,000 and N280,000.\nSimilarly, Lagos to Ilorin as of yesterday was quoted for N350,000 for Thursday’s flight while Friday’s flight cost N240,000 if the traveller was booking on Wednesday.\nGreen Africa, another airline operating the route only has Abuja to Ilorin flight on Saturday with the ticket sold for N225,000. The passenger could pay more because of the airline’s baggage policy which only allows 7kg carry-on luggage.\n “A one-way was sold for N450,000 on Overland during the just concluded Sallah,” an official at the airport said yesterday.\nDemand and Supply factor\nWhile there is no official reaction from airlines, sources attribute the development to forces of demand and supply given that only two airlines currently fly to the airport.\nSpeaking with our correspondent, General Secretary of Aviation Roundtable (ART), Olumide Ohunayo said while the tickets are too high, it is the simple economics of demand and supply.\n“When you have such a situation, price becomes inelastic,” he said, adding it is high time the proposal by ART on new licensing and regulatory regime was implemented.\n“So we need to license operators like air taxi operators so that they can help us with these smaller airports. If we have these small aircraft, airports that are fallow will not be fallow. We need to have these airlines which would also help the airports and more Nigerians would be able to fly and revenues will increase for the agency and we would now begin to see fair and appropriate pricing,” he added.\n…Air fare remains deregulated – NCAA\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Director of Public Affairs and Consumer Protection of NCAA, Mr. Michael Achimugu emphasised that NCAA doesn’t regulate pricing since fares are deregulated.\nAccording to him, NCAA only regulates the industry especially for safety and economic regulation and consumer protection.\nHe noted that with more airlines operating to the airport, there would be “fair competition” and prices would naturally drop.\n“Pricing is not regulated by CAA. There is no CAA anywhere in the world that regulates pricing. Let us also understand that some airlines are incurring losses to operate to some of these airports.”\nSponsored News Update: Nigerians have now been approved to get paid in US Dollars, acquire Ultra-premium domains for as low as $1700 and profit $15,000 (₦24Million naira).

    "title": "House where University of Idaho students killed torn down. Victims’ families opposed it",
    "text": "Demolition of the off-campus home where four University of Idaho students were killed last year began Thursday morning over continued protests from at least half of the victims’ families.\nWork to bring down the unique property got underway before dawn. The noise from the heavy machinery pierced the nearby campus as a local construction firm used an excavator to rip away portions of the facade, starting at the front door.\nBy the scheduled start time of 7 a.m. Pacific, as dozens of members of the media arrived to encircle the boarded-up property and train their cameras toward the wreckage, half of the King Road home was on the ground. About an hour later, the former residence was almost entirely gone.\nThe house, a\nsix-bedroom, three-bathroom rental located less than 600 feet from the university’s new Greek row, was the site of the November 2022 quadruple homicide — one of the most talked-about crimes in state history. The victims were U. of I. seniors Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen, both 21, junior Xana Kernodle and freshman Ethan Chapin, both 20.\nThe three women were tenants of the home with two female housemates who were not physically harmed in the fatal stabbings. Chapin was Kernodle’s boyfriend and stayed over for the night.\nBryan Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University in neighboring Pullman, Washington, at the time, was arrested and charged with the crime in late December 2022. He stood silent when asked to enter a plea, which led to a not guilty plea on his behalf.\nKohberger, 29, a\nPennsylvania native, could face the death penalty if convicted. A trial date has yet to be set.\nIn the spring, the private owner of the house at 1122 King Road donated the property to the university, and the school made plans for its destruction. After the home was left standing for\nmore than a year, U. of I. committed to knocking it down and announced earlier this month a Thursday demolition date.\n“It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” Scott Green, U. of I.’s president, said in a statement at the time. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.”\nDebate over U. of I.’s decision\nThe decision — a contentious one\nahead of a trial date — has drawn widespread scrutiny. In social media groups and threads dedicated to the case, discussion over how the university should handle what became the primary symbol of the high-profile incident grew into a flash point.\nAt least some of that debate was driven by three of the four victims’\nfamilies voicing concerns in recent months about the university razing the scene of the crime before jurors have the chance to decide if visiting may be helpful. An online petition against the home’s destruction amassed more than 8,500 signatures. One petition supporter identified herself as Cara Kernodle, Xana Kernodle’s mother.\n“My daughter was murdered in that house and there is no way they should be destroying any evidence,” the\npost read.\nThe Goncalves and Kernodle families issued a lengthy statement through an attorney the night before the home was scheduled to be torn down. It was titled: PLEASE STOP THE DEMOLITION OF THE KING ROAD HOME!\n“We feel that the University of Idaho and the court has put us in a horrible position to have to voice our opinions,” the statement read in part. “We all along have just wanted the King Road home to not be demolished until after the trial and for us to have a trial date so that we can look forward to justice being served. Is that really too much to ask?”\nAlso, Shanon Gray, the Goncalveses’ attorney, provided a statement in June that opposed the home’s destruction and cited “members of the Mogen and Kernodle families.” Attempts by the Idaho Statesman to reach members of the Mogen and Chapin families were unsuccessful.\nIn response to the pushback, U. of I. spokesperson Jodi Walker told the Statesman in a statement Wednesday that the school understands the gravity of the decision and its unique effect on the four victims’ families. However, efforts to knock down the King Road home would continue as planned.\n“We certainly appreciate that there is a lot of emotion around the demolition of the house,” Walker said. “No one feels that more than the families. But we feel confident this is the right time for our community to take the next step in healing and for the house to come down.”\nThe court has released the property, and neither the defense nor prosecution in the case has objected to leveling the home, the university has previously noted. After this month’s demolition announcement, each side visited the crime scene once more — the prosecution most recently.\nLatah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson, lead on the Kohberger case, thanked the university for its assistance accessing the crime scene last week in an email provided by Walker to the Statesman. The prosecution expected no need of the property going forward, Thompson wrote.\n“Based on our review of Idaho case law, the current condition of the premises is so substantially different than at the time of the homicides that a ‘jury view’ would not be authorized,” Thompson said. “We appreciate the U.I.’s help in facilitating the investigators gathering the necessary measurements, etc., to enable creation of illustrative exhibits that should be admissible and helpful to the jury.”\nKohberger is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary. He remains in custody at the Latah County Jail awaiting trial.\n©2023 The Idaho Statesman. Visit\nidahostatesman.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Evan Daigle to Star Alongside Rachel Dratch in Jason Laurits’ 'Loves Company'",
    "text": "After delivering a few impressive performances, Evan Daigle has secured his first major leading role! The Cinemaholic has learned that he will star alongside Rachel Dratch in Jason Laurits’ thriller film ‘Loves Company.’ As we disclosed earlier , the project’s filming will occur between September 30 and October 18 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Laurits also wrote the screenplay. The movie follows Antoinette (Dratch), a lonely woman who believes that her life is about to change when her favorite Hollywood star, Blake de Troy, unexpectedly crashes into the Florida swamps near her home. Blake, a struggling guest actor eager for a career revival, appears to her as the person who can end her misery. However, when she takes matters into her own hands and kidnaps her idol, she soon realizes the danger of meeting and capturing those you idolize. Daigle is known for his performances as George in Prime Video’s ‘ Daisy Jones & The Six ‘ and Toby Evans in TNT’s ‘ Claws ,’ which explores the lives and crimes of five women working at a Florida nail salon. The actor portrayed the adult version of Edward Morphy in ‘The Opera Game,’ which delves into the troubled life of chess prodigy Paul Morphy in 1850s New Orleans. Additionally, he appeared as Lance in Sea Mo Aldermoon’s dark comedy ‘Pink Elephant,’ in which an irritable Katrina relief volunteer befriends a hallucinating alcoholic and pranks a religious volunteer. Dratch has garnered recognition through her roles in various films and TV shows, such as ‘ Wine Country ,’ ‘Just Go with It,’ ‘Spring Breakdown,’ and Kevin Smith’s ‘The 4:30 Movie.’ Her voice work spans series like ‘Grimsburg,’ ‘Royal Crackers,’ ‘Bob’s Burgers,’ and ‘Harley Quinn.’ Furthermore, the actress has been featured in ‘ Animal Control ‘ and ‘ And Just Like That… ‘ With this project, Laurits has stepped into the feature film realm, following his work on various short films, including ‘Goodbye Tango.’ The work follows Ruth, who clings to her pet hamster, Tango, as a rare source of joy in her otherwise uneventful life with her grumpy wife, Connie, who is absorbed in her bird puzzles. The filmmaker is also behind ‘Cocktail Hour,’ a comedy short about a couple, David and Andrew, who decide to donate sperm, hoping that both will have an equal opportunity to father their future child. Recent notable projects that utilized New Orleans for their backdrop include Jeremy Saulnier’s ‘ Rebel Ridge ‘ and Yorgos Lanthimos’ ‘ Kinds of Kindness .’ Read More: Josh O’Connor to Star in Kelly Reichardt’s ‘The Mastermind’",

    "text": "Melissa Red Hoffman was “feeling really stuck” last summer. A 50-year-old surgeon in Asheville, N.C., Hoffman had been struggling with long COVID since getting infected with the coronavirus two and a half years earlier. “Deafening fatigue” was one of her worst symptoms, she says. “I feel tired behind my eyes from the moment I get up to the moment I go to sleep.” She managed to work part time, but much of her work had shifted to administrative tasks that she did from her couch.\n“I was really at a point where I had tried so many different things myself, with so many different providers,” she says, “not really sure what the hell to do next.”\nThen she found\nRemission Biome. It’s a research project started in early 2023 by Tamara Romanuk and Tess Falor, two people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, a chronic disease that shares symptoms with long COVID. Project participants have taken medical research into their own hands to determine whether and how changes to their gut bacteria can improve their health. After an initial test with three participants led to some symptom relief, Romanuk and Falor announced last July that they would recruit 50 people with ME/CFS, long COVID or both for a larger test of the project’s protocol.\nHoffman was one of 500 people who applied within 36 hours of the call for volunteers. By the fall, she and 49 other people, dubbed the “Renegade 50,” had joined the project.\nRemission Biome’s protocol is a multistep process, which participants undertake in consultation with their physicians. Initial steps involve patients collecting samples of their guts, immune systems and other connected organ systems, either at home or at a health care provider’s office. After those samples are analyzed by a lab to get baseline data, participants take a regimen of over-the-counter supplements, such as probiotics to cultivate certain types of gut bacteria, and then a prescribed antibiotic. Next comes further testing to examine if and how the regimen altered the composition of the gut microbiome. Throughout the process, participants track their symptoms and learn about past research on the microbiome that informed the project, ensuring that they understand the rationale for every step.\nEarly in the testing process, Hoffman’s fatigue started to lift, she says. “That’s been exciting, just to feel a little bit of a change.”\nAlleviating symptoms — which can include debilitating fatigue, trouble sleeping, intense allergic reactions and cognitive problems — motivates many members of the Renegade 50, who come from different countries, age groups and stages of illness. But participants also aim to collect and publish data that will give the broader scientific community more information about ME/CFS and long COVID, two complex, often fluctuating conditions.\nParticipant María Richardson, a 36-year-old former educator in Mexico City, has dealt with progressively worse ME/CFS symptoms since high school. She received her diagnosis in the United States in 2015, but when she moved back to her native Mexico, where knowledge of the condition is limited, trying to get care “was like starting from zero,” she says. Remission Biome helped her better understand her own symptoms and share scientific information with the ME/CFS community in Mexico, through the ME/CFS advocacy group\nMillions Missing Mexico.\nRemission Biome is one effort in the growing movement of patient-led research, which seeks to investigate chronic conditions that have been under-researched by academic and clinical scientists yet impact many people’s lives.\n“People who were ignored by the American health care system … often need to turn to each other in order to gather the data that gets the attention of the mainstream,” says health care researcher Susannah Fox, author of the new book\nRebel Health: A Field Guide to the Patient-Led Revolution in Medical Care.\nCompared with mainstream medical research that tends to focus on finding biological causes and disease cures, patient-led work is more often rooted in what’s immediately relevant to patients’ daily lives, like identifying symptom triggers or relievers. But the approach faces challenges — particularly a lack of funding and other research resources — as scientific institutions aren’t set up to support these projects.\nPatient-researchers and their scientist collaborators say the patient-led approach has big potential to move chronic disease research forward, making it more informed, quicker and more poised to directly improve patients’ lives.\nProjects like Remission Biome “are going to change how research into these chronic, multi-organ-system diseases is going to be done,” Hoffman says. The approach may someday become a standard part of more mainstream research.\nA history of patient activism and patient-led research\nAbout 1.3% of adults in the United States have ME/CFS, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists first noticed the condition in the 1930s, but since then, it’s been hard to define and hasn’t attracted extensive research attention. Initial observations noted outbreaks characterized by fatigue, chronic pain and other symptoms now associated with ME/CFS, often occurring — but not always — after viral infections. Scientists started to link these mysterious outbreaks in the 1980s under the umbrella term chronic fatigue syndrome.\nProgress on identifying the disease’s triggers has been slow, in part because of the wide variety of symptoms across many organ systems and in part due to relatively limited research funding. And some doctors have dismissed patients’ symptoms as all psychological — a factor that some experts connect to the disease’s higher burden on women.\nCombined, these challenges have contributed to a lack of treatments for people with ME/CFS, despite the illness’s potentially devastating impact on patients. Long COVID — which 6.8 percent of U.S. adults currently have, according to data from the CDC and U.S. Census Bureau — raised the profile of ME/CFS during the pandemic because of\nthe two conditions’ similarities.\nRemission Biome started thanks to a Twitter conversation in fall 2022. Falor and Romanuk realized they had both independently experienced what they call “remission events,” in which symptoms recede for a few hours or days after courses of antibiotics. These events led each of them to look into the possible connection between ME/CFS symptoms and the gut microbiome, an emerging area of study with many unanswered questions. The pair were also both working scientists before their symptoms became debilitating. Falor had worked as an aerospace engineer at NASA; Romanuk had been a biologist studying microbiomes.\nThe two scientists set out to replicate their remission events — and collect extensive data on how their microbiomes and bodily systems changed to better understand the underlying biology of these events. They started with a self-test in early 2023, which included taking a lengthy list of supplements chosen to either increase or decrease levels of specific bacteria with possible ME/CFS connections. In addition to Romanuk and Falor, Isabel Ramirez-Burnett, a 50-year-old engineer and health coach in Rhode Island who has lived with ME/CFS since childhood, participated in the experiment.\nThe testing “went even better than we could have expected,” Falor says, with two of the three participants experiencing remission events. So Remission Biome expanded to the Renegade 50 cohort and fundraised through a crowdfunding campaign, grants and sponsorships to support this larger project. The team also recruited the participants’ physicians, to help ensure safety, along with scientists to collaborate with the participants and other volunteer researchers working on the project. Scientists regularly attend research meetings hosted by Remission Biome, Falor says, which include presentations and discussions about new, relevant findings in other ME/CFS and long COVID research.\nTheoharis Theoharides is one of those scientists. As director of the Center of Excellence for Neuroinflammation Research at Nova Southeastern University in Clearwater, Fla., he has decades of experience studying mast cell activation syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by intense allergic reactions that is often diagnosed alongside ME/CFS and long COVID. “They’re very bright, very dedicated,” Theoharides says of Falor and Romanuk. He has provided feedback on Remission Biome’s regimen of supplements and plans to help analyze microbiome and blood samples taken from the Renegade 50 participants to look at how immune system changes may connect to their gut bacteria.\nAnother collaborator is Tatyana Dobreva, cofounder and CEO of the San Francisco–based biotech start-up\nImYoo, which operates remote clinical trials and other research. ImYoo is assisting Remission Biome with genetic analysis of patient blood samples. The Renegade 50 study is similar to other ImYoo projects studying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and sickle cell disease, in which participants tie symptom tracking to data from medical testing, Dobreva says.\nRemission Biome adds to a long history of patients with complex and contested illnesses advocating for their communities, Fox says. “Every decade of the 20th century had an example of people who were either being ignored or who were being discriminated against” by scientists and doctors, and who “banded together to innovate or gather data,” she says. Examples include Black people with\nsickle cell disease in the 1970s and people with HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. In some cases, this translated to patient-informed research, in which patients consult on scientific projects, informing everything from research questions to how results are disseminated.\nIn the 21st century, the internet aided patient-led projects, with patients actually doing research, as like-minded patients could more easily find each other, as happened with Romanuk and Falor, Fox says. In these projects, patients also closely follow scientific studies about their disease and may collaborate with academic experts to develop scientific frameworks, rather than self-experimenting individually.\nME/CFS patients have been particularly motivated to pursue their own research, says Emily Taylor, vice president of advocacy and engagement at the ME/CFS organization\nSolve M.E. One key motivator is “the failure of the medical establishment to provide any sort of support or treatment or quality of life improvements for this population,” she says. Previous ME/CFS research done without patient input, such as a now-debunked clinical trial examining exercise as a potential treatment, has led patients to push back with their own studies.\n“There was a desperate need to validate the anecdotal stories of patients in a formalized way,” Taylor says.\nIn spring 2020, during the first months of the pandemic, patients whose symptoms persisted for weeks after the initial infection started documenting their complex symptoms in real time. The\nPatient-Led Research Collaborative, or PLRC, formed out of a long COVID support group, led by members who had scientific experience. PLRC released its first report in May 2020, documenting symptoms common among the group’s hundreds of members. “We saw a need to start collecting people’s experiences and really try to take things into our own hands,” says PLRC cofounder and long COVID patient Lisa McCorkell.\nPatients are experts\nPatient-led and patient-informed research can be a win-win for both patients and scientists, advocates say. For patients, this work is more likely to address questions that are meaningful to their daily lives, says Jaime Seltzer, director of science and medical outreach at the advocacy group\n#MEAction. In one pre-pandemic example, a patient group focused on polycystic kidney disease proposed potential treatments to scientists at the University of Cambridge, leading to clinical trials at a new patient-led research hub.\nPatient leadership can also inspire people to participate in clinical trials, as the interest in joining Remission Biome demonstrates. And study designs informed by patient experience often prioritize accommodations for people with different levels of symptoms or access to care, meaning a more diverse group of patients may be able to participate. With a patient-led, “decentralized” approach to research, “we can reach more people in more diverse areas” who don’t live near medical facilities in big cities or aren’t able to travel for clinical trials, Dobreva says.\nConnor, a member of the Renegade 50 who asked that only his first name be used to maintain medical privacy, “couldn’t participate in a traditional study,” says his wife, Nicole Bruno. Since a COVID-19 infection two and a half years ago, he has faced a severe case of both long COVID and ME/CFS, leaving him bedbound in a dark room.\n“He could never go to a lab” or a doctor’s office to have samples collected, Bruno says. But with Remission Biome’s remote framework and individual support, he can be a patient-researcher. In addition to flexibility in locations, each member of the cohort is going through the testing protocol at their own pace, incorporating their microbiome test results, other diagnoses and input from their physicians. Flexibility also helps with logistical challenges; for example, test kits take longer to ship internationally.\nFor scientists, patient-led studies may move a field forward by highlighting key questions and hypotheses that might not emerge from traditional research. “Biomedical research has blind spots,” Fox says. McCorkell points\nto a paper from the PLRC00299-6/fulltext#%20), published in eClinicalMedicine in 2021, that expanded upon its 2020 survey work by describing 200 long COVID symptoms across 10 organ systems based on a detailed survey of about 3,800 people.\n“It is still, to this day, one of the most cited papers in long COVID,” McCorkell says. Without this paper, she adds, other scientists might still be investigating “a small, limited set of symptoms” rather than the full scope of the condition. David Putrino, a long COVID clinician and director of rehabilitation innovation at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, also points to the PLRC paper as an example of successful patient-led research that informed later studies.\nPatient-led research “moves orders of magnitude faster than traditional modes of research,” Putrino says, because it focuses on the questions that are of greatest concern to patients, leading more quickly to impactful results. Patient-led groups may also be able to start new studies more quickly than institutions that have to, say, go through formal academic procedures, he says. In that way, this research is similar to how start-ups move faster than large corporations.\nIn addition, patients can help scientists design studies that are more likely to provide accurate results. For example, feedback from members of Remission Biome and other patient representatives helped David Esteban, a biologist at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., who was looking for people who had gotten COVID-19 but didn’t develop long COVID and could serve as control patients in a project funded by PLRC.\n“Their perspective was, many people who recover from acute COVID go through a period where they feel better, but then get worse again,” he says. “I hadn’t really thought about that.” But that insight helped Esteban establish how long after a COVID-19 infection to wait before declaring a patient past the threshold for developing long COVID.\nAfter studies are completed, patient teams may be more thoughtful about communicating results back to patient communities. In sharing\na recent paper about managing ME/CFS00402-0/fulltext#%20) that she coauthored with clinicians at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for instance, Seltzer anticipated questions that ME/CFS patients might have about the study. She explained up front that the paper was a concise review and could not include every relevant study, as patients would want to know “why I hadn’t mentioned their favorite paper,” she says. Such communication can “save a research group a lot of time and energy,” Seltzer says, and can encourage patients to bring the paper to their doctors so that the findings might inform their health care.\nGroups like PLRC are working to build infrastructure to help scientists better engage with patients, including experienced patient-researchers and others who haven’t done scientific work before.\nIn January 2023, PLRC and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies\nintroduced scorecards for academic teams interested in these collaborations. The scorecards can help teams evaluate success. “Our scorecards were developed with the intention of trying to change the baseline of what’s considered acceptable patient engagement,” McCorkell says, moving away from “tokenizing” engagement that she and other PLRC members have experienced. Taylor, at Solve M.E., would like to see the scorecards or a similar evaluation incorporated into traditional funding applications at scientific institutions.\nThe challenges of patient-led research\nCurrent institutional and financial support for patient-led research projects is limited. These projects typically are not eligible to apply for academic and government grants, leading them to seek money from nontraditional sources. Patient-researchers also don’t tend to have access to laboratory space, clinical tests and other research resources.\n“We’re limited in the type of research that we can do,” McCorkell says. As a result, surveys and self-experimentation are the most common methods.\nInternal capacity is another challenge: Chronically ill people tend to have limited energy to devote to projects; they must balance this work with managing their symptoms. Patients tend to be more ambitious than their available energy can support, Seltzer says. Sometimes a patient-researcher might have to take a break from a project to recover from a symptom flare-up. Projects like Remission Biome take these crashes into account when designing experiments and distributing tasks.\n“If I disappear for a week,” it’s OK, says Katrin Boniface, a doctoral student studying the history of horses at the University of California, Riverside who had her own remission experience before joining the Renegade 50. But these constraints might frustrate academic or clinician collaborators who want patient-researchers to answer emails at all hours or pull together a last-minute grant proposal.\nNonpatient scientists might also be skeptical of results from patient-led research, as many in the scientific community haven’t yet recognized how lived experience can improve studies, Seltzer says. Although many patient-researchers have scientific backgrounds, they might not be experienced in biomedical research, leading to perceptions that they are underqualified and that their work is not rigorous or may even be biased.\nAdvocates like Seltzer argue that patient-researchers are more incentivized than anyone to make sure their results are accurate. “If we’re wrong, we and people like us suffer,” she says.\nTaylor argues that data from patient-led research should be added to the types of evidence that regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration consider for approving treatments. The FDA and the National Institutes of Health took one step in this direction earlier this year by soliciting data from long COVID patients and doctors about their experiences with treatments approved for other diseases.\nBut some scientists and doctors are concerned that patient-led projects might encourage some patients to self-experiment on their own without appropriate safety measures. This has been a big challenge for Remission Biome, especially after its members posted about remission events during the project’s first phase in early 2023. Initially, the plan was to openly share all aspects of the project, including protocols and results, says Ramirez-Burnett, one of the three early participants. “But then we realized that people were starting to pick pieces of the protocol in order to do it, which is not safe,” she says. “So we had to close that document.”\nNow, when asked about the full protocol, as they often are on social media, Remission Biome participants typically encourage safety and emphasize that more testing is needed before it’s widely shared. In the future, Ramirez-Burnett hopes to educate more clinicians about the project so they can work with patients outside the Remission Biome infrastructure.\nPatient-led projects may also struggle with logistics. This has been the case for Remission Biome. Its two founders split in December over disagreements about the project’s pace, its handling of safety aspects and how to incorporate the project as a formal business. As a result, Romanuk and the group parted ways.\nThe Renegade 50 test was put on hold until mid-March while Falor and other project members addressed this leadership change and set up as a nonprofit, she says. The team is also adding more safety steps and participant education on the antibiotic in the testing protocol because that antibiotic may have negative side effects for some people with ME/CFS. Falor expects the Renegade 50 phase will be completed later this year, after which the project will share preliminary results and begin setting up a cohort of 500 participants.\nTests and supplements for that next cohort will require more financial support, which Remission Biome will continue to raise from its GoFundMe campaign and grants. The project has also secured sponsorships from supplement and testing companies, such as the probiotics provider FitBiomics, to provide research supplies to participants. Financial support is especially important for participants living in places where it’s difficult to receive medical care for ME/CFS, says Richardson, the Renegade 50 member in Mexico. Many patients globally could benefit from this work, she says.\nRemission Biome is also working toward scientific publications, based on data from the Renegade 50 cohort and from side projects. But the 50-person test might not lead to publishable results, says scientist-collaborator Theoharides. The microbiome is extremely complex, and, unlike a clinical trial, the Renegade 50 group does not include control patients not taking the treatments. But he hopes “the information that will come out of this study might actually give us some new directions.” One key advantage, he says, is that each participant is testing many supplements rather than focusing on one at a time; ME/CFS and long COVID are such complex diseases that it’s unlikely for a single treatment to work for all patients or have a lasting impact.\nEsteban, the biologist at Vassar College, similarly hopes to examine how different antibiotics might work together to alleviate symptoms. “I’m already thinking about experiments that I could do,” he says, such as work in lab animals that would “start to explore some of the proposed mechanisms that might underlie the effects they’re seeing with the antibiotic treatments.”\nWhile Remission Biome’s participants are excited to contribute to research, their most important goal is to provide “solutions for the ME/CFS community,” Ramirez-Burnett says. “So people don’t have to lose their jobs, lose their relationships, not get proper care.”\nAmong the three Renegade 50 participants who had completed the testing protocol as of January, one experienced a remission event, signifying a potential success, Falor says. Meanwhile, the project’s frequent meetings, Slack group, apps for shared symptom-tracking and other communication options could provide models for other patient-research efforts.\nRemission Biome participants who have dealt with ME/CFS for a long time, like Richardson, feel particularly motivated to help find answers for the millions around the world newly struggling with long COVID. “People with mild long COVID sound like what I experienced 20 years ago,” Richardson says. She hopes that the lessons learned from Remission Biome and other projects like it can help prevent new long COVID patients from experiencing decades of symptoms.\nExperimental design\nRemission Biome is studying whether changes to the gut microbiome can improve the health of people with ME/CFS or long COVID. Participants follow a protocol that includes taking prebiotic and probiotic supplements and a course of antibiotics.\n- Initial safety checks and testing: Samples from several body systems are collected and analyzed to ensure it’s safe for a volunteer to participate and to collect baseline data.\n- Symptom tracking: Participants record their symptoms throughout the project.\n- Start supplements: Participants begin taking prebiotics and probiotics.\n- Antibiotic added: An antibiotic is added to the regimen for 14 days.\n- Post-antibiotic testing: Body systems are checked again to look for changes.\n- Result: Remission Biome members hope to experience some symptom relief, as well as publish study findings and inspire new research projects for professional scientists.\nSource: Remission Biome\nThis article was published by The Sick Times, a new website chronicling the long COVID crisis, on April, 2024 and was by Science News.

    "title": "Crypto exchange Binance sued by Hamas hostages, Oct. 7 victims' families for allegedly 'facilitating terrorism'",
    "text": "(NEW YORK) — An American woman freed after being held hostage in Gaza and the families of two men killed in the Oct. 7 attack in Israel sued Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, which they accused of providing a funding mechanism for Hamas.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court Thursday, also named Iran and Syria and is the first of what could be a torrent of lawsuits over the Hamas attack against Israel that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead, according to Israeli officials.\nAmong the plaintiffs are members of the Raanan family. Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie, were kidnapped and held in Gaza before they were freed in a prisoner exchange in October. Other plaintiffs include the family and estate of Itay Glisko, the 20-year-old New Jersey native and IDF sergeant killed in action during the attack by Hamas.\nThe lawsuit accused Binance of processing numerous transactions for Hamas between 2017 and 2023, “providing a clandestine financing tool that Binance deliberately hid from U.S. regulators.”\nBinance did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment.\nThe company and its former CEO Chengpeng Zhao pled guilty last year to violations of U.S. anti-money laundering laws while agreeing to pay more than $4 billion in fines.\nThe violations included processing and failing to report “transactions with cryptocurrency wallets that Binance senior executives had knowledge were linked to terrorist groups such as Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad,” according to a Department of Justice filing.\nZhao agreed to resign as part of his plea deal and will be sentenced in February where he faces up to 18 months in prison. The company also agreed to enter in a number of anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs and retain an independent monitor for the next three years.\n“For years, Binance remained willfully blind to the use of its platform by illicit actors, including terrorists, by failing to do any due diligence on the vast majority of its users prior to August 2021,” the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit added, “Incredibly, Binance went out of its way to protect users associated with Hamas and other terrorist groups from regulatory scrutiny, especially if they were ‘VIP users who generated huge profits for Binance.”\nThe lawsuit, modeled on suits that emerged after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, accused Binance of aiding terror organizations, providing material support to terrorists and sought unspecified damages.\n“This needs to be done. These crypto funds are turning a blind eye to all of this illegal activity and now it’s actually facilitating terrorism,” said plaintiff’s attorney Rob Seiden. “We’re doing this to send a message to these crypto institutions: you can’t do this stuff. You have to be more vigilant.”\nMore than 100 hostages are thought to still be detained in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7 attack has killed at least 27,019 people in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

    "text": "GAZA STRIP, Palaestinian Territories: The Israeli military has issued so many evacuation orders in 10 months of war that many Gaza civilians no longer heed them, despairing of finding space or safety in the shrinking “humanitarian” zones.\nOver the first three weeks of August, the Israeli army sent out 11 evacuation orders via flyers dropped from planes, text messages or social media.\nThey called on 250,000 Gazans, almost all of whom had been displaced at least once already, to leave their place of shelter.\n“The Israeli army will operate with force against terrorist organizations in this area. For your safety, we urge you to evacuate immediately,” read one such order sent out Thursday in the southern province of Khan Yunis.\n“Every time we arrive somewhere, we get a new evacuation order two days later. This is no way to live,” Haitham Abdelaal told AFP.\nAmneh Abu Daqqa, 45, said she saw no point in moving again, so few were the options for safe haven.\n“To go where?” asked the displaced mother of five.\n“I live on the street, literally. I don’t have 500 shekels ($133) to rent a donkey-pulled cart. And I don’t even know where I’d go,” she said.\n“There is nowhere safe, there are air strikes everywhere.”\nThe proliferation of Israeli evacuation orders also severely complicates relief distribution by United Nations agencies in a blockaded territory where aid trickles in via Israeli-held entry points.\nWednesday’s evacuation order included “80 makeshift sites” but also offices and warehouses used by aid agencies, the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said.\nThe orders also affected “three water wells... which serve tens of thousands of people,” OCHA added.\nSometimes, the evacuation orders close roads, including the main Salah Al-Din highway that runs the length of Gaza from north to south.\nWhen portions of it are included in evacuation orders, transport becomes a headache.\nTrucks must use the coast road that runs parallel to Salah Al-Din, currently lined with makeshift camps that make movement “extremely slow and at times impossible,” OCHA said.\nNerman Al-Bashniti, who lives in one such camp, told AFP: “When the Israeli army took the street that we were on, we ran to the sea, left our tent and all our belongings inside.\n“Where will we go now? We can only throw ourselves into the sea and let the fish eat us.”\nIn the early days of the war, the Israeli army touted its plans for the displaced.\nAfter it ordered the evacuation of the north in the first week of the war, it published a map of Gaza broken down into several hundred numbered blocks, and declared the southern area of Al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone.”\nTo let Palestinians know precisely which areas will be targeted by military operations, its evacuation orders feature the numbered blocks varying in size depending on building density.\nBut the many blocks have made the orders confusing and sometimes even contradictory, such as on occasions when blocks listed for evacuation were not featured as to be evacuated on the accompanying maps.\nFrom 1,200 inhabitants per square kilometer before the war, the Al-Mawasi “humanitarian zone” now houses “between 30,000 and 34,000 people per square kilometer” and its protected area shrank from 50 square kilometers to 41, the UN calculated.\nMost of Gaza is one extended built-up area, but Al-Mawasi was the location of most of the territory’s Jewish settlements before Israel demolished them when it pulled out in 2005 leaving farmland fringed by the beach.\nNow the area is a vast tent-city with more families desperately looking for space to pitch a tent with each new evacuation order.\nProliferating evacuation

grappling with the steep obstacles to conducting mass vaccination in the war-torn Palestinian territory.\nUnrelenting airstrikes by Israel more than 10 months into its war against Gaza rulers Hamas, restrictions of aid entering the besieged territory, and hot summer temperatures all threaten the viability of a life-saving inoculation drive.\nStill, equipment to support the extensive campaign — which UN agencies say could start on Aug. 31 — has already arrived in the region.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in the occupied West Bank said last week that tests in Jordan had confirmed polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby from central Gaza.\nAccording to the UN, Gaza had not registered a case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory’s wastewater in June.\nPoliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water — an increasingly common problem in Gaza.\nThe disease mainly affects children under the age of five.\nIt can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal.\nUN bodies, the World Health Organization, and children’s agency UNICEF say they have detailed plans to vaccinate 640,000 children across Gaza.\nBut a significant challenge remains Israel’s devastating military campaign.\n“It’s extremely difficult to undertake a vaccination campaign of this scale and volume under a sky full of airstrikes,” said Juliette Touma, director of communications for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\nUnder the UN plan, 2,700 health workers in 708 teams would take part, with the WHO overseeing the effort, said Richard Peeperkorn, the agency’s representative in the Palestinian territories.\nUNICEF would ensure the cold supply chain as vaccines are brought into and distributed across Gaza, spokesman Jonathan Crickx said.\nCold chain components, including refrigerators, arrived Wednesday at Israel’s main international airport.\nDemolition of historic Alexandria site sparks public controversy\n- Residents of the Egyptian city post messages on Facebook confirming part of Dekheila Fort, a site dating back as far as 1250 A.D., has been destroyed\n- Heritage enthusiast Ziad Morsi says: ‘Unfortunately, what was demolished is the oldest registered Mamluk-era monument in Alexandria’\nCAIRO: The recent demolition of parts of Dekheila Fort, a historic site near Alexandria that dates back to 1250 A.D., has sparked widespread controversy and criticism.\nOfficials from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities declined to respond to a request for comment on the destruction at the site but residents and heritage campaigners posted messages on Facebook that seemed to confirm it happened.\nIn one such post, local resident and heritage enthusiast Ziad Morsi said Dekheila Fort consisted of two structures and two cannons. One of the structures, known as the basin, which was built during the Mamluk period that ran from 1250 to 1517, has been demolished, he confirmed.\nThe second structure, which remains standing, is a tower that is a remnant of fortifications built by Ghalis Pasha during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805-1848) and reinforced with Armstrong cannons during the rule of Khedive Ismail Pasha (1863-1879), he said.\nMorsi wrote on Tuesday: “We were surprised yesterday by images from the Dekheila area showing a bulldozer demolishing the dry dock area and Dekheila Fort. I want to highlight a few points, the first of which is that the Dekheila beach area contains several historical sites, some of which are officially listed as Islamic antiquities in Egypt, while others remain unregistered.\n“Unfortunately, what was demolished is the oldest registered Mamluk-era monument in Alexandria. Some friends had plans to conduct detailed studies and propose a restoration project for it.”\nAbdel Rahim Rehan, head of the Campaign to Defend Egyptian Civilization, an organization established a few years ago to encourage preservation of the nation’s heritage, said: “The basin adjacent to Dekheila fort, which is reportedly demolished, is registered with the Ministry of Antiquities.\n“It is located directly on the shore of Lake Dekheila and was used during the Mamluk era for city defense. However, it was repurposed during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha as a lighthouse to guide ships entering Alexandria’s ports.”\nHe added that the basin had suffered damage from winter coastal storms, marine debris and sewage infrastructure.\nThe Alexandria Antiquities Directorate has not commented on the demolition at the site. However, on Wednesday it said two historical cannons had been moved as part of a transfer of artifacts from the Dekheila fortifications to the nearby Kom El-Nadoura archaeological area.\nAn official from the directorate said: “Each cannon weighs 9 tonnes and they were moved following approval from the Permanent Committee for Islamic and Coptic Antiquities to ensure better preservation at the new site, as they are among the most important registered artifacts.\n“The transfer was conducted under special procedures to preserve the cannons, with police security provided during the move. The cannons are now part of a collection in Kom El-Nadoura in Alexandria, where a display area for the cannons is being prepared. It will be completed once the entire contents of the fort are transferred.”\nThe Department of Archaeological Engineering and Environment at Cairo University’s Faculty of Engineering previously carried out studies at the site in preparation for a restoration project but no work was carried out.\nIsrael military court extends house arrest of soldiers accused of Palestinian prisoner abuse\n- UN special rapporteur on torture has said the alleged sexual abuse case is “particularly gruesome” and called on Israel’s civilian courts to investigate\nJERUSALEM: Israel’s military court has extended the house arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee until Sept. 4 but will allow the defense to hold a hearing on Sunday to request an alternative to detention, the military said on Thursday.\nIt specified such an alternative could include ‘a place of work and suitable supervisors’.\nThe soldiers have been accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit at the Sde Teiman detention facility in the Negev desert in southern Israel, according to Israeli press reports.\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on torture has said the alleged sexual abuse case is “particularly gruesome” and called on Israel’s civilian courts to investigate and hold the perpetrators to account.\nThe UN has received multiple reports of alleged torture against Palestinians detained since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed Israel in a shock assault that killed some 1,200 people.\nMore than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza in the 10 months of fighting that have followed, according to health officials in the Palestinian enclave.\nJapanese FM hopes Lebanese government will urge Hezbollah to avoid escalation\n- China advises its citizens to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’\n- Israeli warplanes carry out near-simultaneous raids on 14 border villages\nBEIRUT: Japan says it hopes the Lebanese government will urge Hezbollah to avoid escalating hostilities to prevent its conflict with Israel spreading across the region.\nIn a telephone call to her Lebanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said Tokyo was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East with deep concern” and “calls on all parties to refrain from escalation and avoid a full-scale war in the region.”\nHer appeal came as Israeli warplanes on Thursday carried out several raids on border villages in southern Lebanon, destroying several buildings.\nAccording to Lebanon’s caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib’s media office, Kamikawa “emphasized Japan’s support for the tripartite effort led by the US, Egypt and Qatar to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.”\nDuring the call, Bou Habib warned that the situation in the region could spiral out of control if negotiations regarding Gaza failed.\nHe reiterated Lebanon’s “desire to avoid escalation and war and the need for a ceasefire in Gaza to establish calm in southern Lebanon and the region.”\nHe said he appreciated Japan’s “support for Lebanon at the UN.”\nKamikawa said Japan was coordinating with France on the UN Security Council regarding the extension of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon’s mandate, recognizing its importance.\nCaretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati's media office said the ongoing communications regarding the Security Council’s renewal of UNIFIL’s mandate for another year at the end of this month “showed an understanding of Lebanon’s demand to maintain the tasks of these forces without introducing any changes that could complicate the already tense situation.”\nThe Chinese Embassy in Beirut, meanwhile, said in a statement on Thursday that Beijing was urging its citizens in Lebanon to leave “as soon as possible.”\n“Recently, the situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has continued to be tense and security circumstances in Lebanon are severe and complex,” it said.\n“The current level of risk to travel in Lebanon’s South and Nabatieh Governorates is red (extremely high risk) and other areas is orange (high risk).”\nIsraeli warplanes carried out almost simultaneous raids on Thursday on 14 border villages. They followed 13 military operations carried out by Hezbollah on Wednesday against Israeli army positions and outposts.\nThe Israeli raids targeted homes in Aita Al-Shaab, Kfarshouba, Mhaibib, Mais Al-Jabal, Wadi Al-Azba near Zebqine, Chihine, Kaouthariyet Al-Saiyad, Ramyeh, Kfarkila, Naqoura, Jable, Labbouneh and Allam.\nArmy spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X that Israeli forces “attacked and destroyed Hezbollah targets in over 10 different areas in southern Lebanon.”\n“The targets included weapons depots, military buildings and a rocket launcher used by Hezbollah to carry out attack operations against Israel.”\nHezbollah said it responded with an attack on “the Branit site with heavy artillery shells” and “an aerial attack with a fleet of drones on Israeli army positions in the Kiryat Shmona settlement.”\nIt also targeted “spy equipment in the Jal Al-Allam site with an attack drone, hitting it directly,” and targeted “gatherings for Israeli soldiers in the surroundings of the Metula settlement, using direct weapons and causing direct hits.”\nHezbollah also targeted “a positioning of Israeli soldiers near Al-Ghajar site with appropriate weapons, killing and injuring its members,” it said.\nNo casualties were reported following the Israeli attacks, but Israeli media said “three mortars landed in Metula, near the Lebanese border, without causing the sirens to activate.”\nWhile the army spokesperson gave no explanation for the shelling a Lebanese security source said Hezbollah’s attacks on Wednesday “didn’t violate the rules of engagement.”\nHezbollah’s attacks on Wednesday targeted the Tsnobar logistics base in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights after Israel attacked Hezbollah’s weapon depots in northern Bekaa on Tuesday. Some of Hezbollah’s rockets landed in the town of Katzrin, injuring one person.\nIsraeli Channel 7 reported that 60 homes in the town had been damaged.\nSpeaking to Israeli Radio 104.5, Yehuda Dua, the head of the local council in Katzrin, said: “Five Hezbollah rockets hit the town, destroying homes and leaving families homeless.”\nAccording to the emergency health report prepared by the Lebanese Ministry of Health, “from Oct. 8, 2023 until Aug. 20, 2024 the total number of recorded injuries has reached 2,412, including 564 fatalities.”\nAbandoned oil tanker threatens Red Sea ecology, trade, warns EU naval mission\n- MV Sounion was attacked by Houthis on Wednesday\n- Four members of Yemen’s Baha’i community released after more than a year\nAL-MUKALLA: A tanker carrying 150,000 tonnes of crude oil that became adrift in the Red Sea after multiple Houthi strikes is now threatening the sea’s environment and maritime navigation traffic, the EU naval mission said on Thursday.\nThe EU naval mission in the Red Sea, known as EUNAFVOR ASPIDES, said that its warship evacuated the crew members of the Greek-flagged MV Sounion, which lost engine power after being attacked several times in the Red Sea and ferried them to Djibouti.\n“Carrying 150.000 tonnes of crude oil, the MV SOUNION now represents a navigational and environmental hazard. It is essential that everyone in the area exercises caution and refrains from any actions that could lead to a deterioration of the current situation,” the EU mission said in a post on X.\nA senior government official in Yemen’s southern city of Aden told Arab News on Thursday that relevant authorities are gathering information regarding the danger posed by the abandoned ship.\nIn May, a ship carrying 21,000 metric tons of ammonium phosphate sulfate fertilizer crashed in the Red Sea after being hit by Houthi missiles, prompting fears of an ecological disaster.\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center said on Thursday that the MV Sounion on Wednesday exchanged fire with two boats before being hit by projectiles northwest of Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.\nAll of the projectiles ripped through the starboard quarter, damaging the engine compartment, causing a contained fire, and injuring a crew member. The tanker had no links to the US, UK or Israel, which is the Houthis’ rationale for targeting ships in international commerce channels.\nIn a speech on Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malik Al-Houthi claimed responsibility for the attack on tanker, saying it violated the militia’s ban on sailing to Israeli ports.\nHe also stated that his troops carried out 21 operations against ships using ballistic and cruise missiles, drones, and drone boats in the last seven days, bringing the total number of ships attacked to 182 since the start of their anti-ship campaign.\nThis comes as the UK Maritime Trade Operations said on Thursday that a cargo ship was slightly damaged after being attacked by a drone 57 nautical miles south of Aden, but the ship’s crew members were unharmed. The master of the same ship, the Panama-flagged SW North Wind I, told UKMTO of five explosions near the ship on Wednesday, with no reported damage or crew injuries.\nAccording to marinetraffic.com, the SW North Wind I is a bulk carrier heading from South Korea to Egypt.\nSince November, the Houthis have seized a commercial ship, sunk two more, and launched hundreds of drones, drone boats, and ballistic missiles at commercial and naval vessels in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and other areas, claiming that their actions are intended to force Israel to end its war in the Gaza Strip.\nAs part of actions to degrade Houthi military capabilities, US Central Command said its troops destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile and radar system in Yemen. The Houthis said that the US and UK forces launched five attacks on the province of Hodeidah this week.\nMeanwhile, the Baha’i International Community, which speaks on behalf of the religious group, said the Houthis have freed the final four Yemeni Baha’is imprisoned by the militia for more than a year.\nIn May 2023, armed Houthis attacked a Baha’i gathering in Sanaa and abducted 17 people, sparking anger, condemnations and allegations against the Houthis for oppressing Yemen’s religious minorities.\n“We are relieved that this grim, unjust, and absurd episode is finally over. But these 17 Baha’is should never have been arrested in the first place. The group had gathered in a private home for a peaceful community activity,” Saba Haddad, representative of the Baha’i International Community to the UN in Geneva, said in a statement.\nThe Houthis accuse the Baha’is of being infidels and spying for the US and Israel.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues.php) Subscribe now",

    "text": "El Gobierno de Canarias , a través de la Dirección General de Emergencias, ha declarado para este domingo la situación de prealerta por fenómenos costeros en las islas de La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro, Tenerife y Gran Canaria. El aviso se activará a las 7.00 horas de este domingo según la información facilitada por la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) y otras fuentes disponibles, y en aplicación del Plan Específico de Emergencias de Canarias por Riesgos de Fenómenos Meteorológicos Adversos (PEFMA).\nLa previsión meteorológica anuncia rachas de viento fuerte del nordeste en altamar con fuerza 7 (de 50 a 61 kilómetros por hora) entre las islas de La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro, Tenerife y sureste de Gran Canaria y fuerte marejada con áreas de mar gruesa en altamar, con mar de fondo de componente norte y olas de uno a dos metros de altura.\nAdemás, se prevé oleaje de mar que podría superar el metro y medio de altura y rachas de viento locales que podrían superar los 60 kilómetros por hora en costas del sureste y del noroeste de estas islas.\nAnte esta situación, el Gobierno de Canarias solicita a la población que evite situaciones de riesgo en las zonas costeras señaladas y ponga en práctica las recomendaciones de autoprotección establecidas en estos casos para evitar riesgos y accidentes en el mar.\nMientras se mantenga el mal estado del mar, es fundamental no situarse en muelles y escolleras, ni permanecer en lugares cercanos al mar para evitar ser golpeados o arrastrados por las olas. En este sentido, se recuerda no realizar selfis, ni filmaciones en estas zonas cercanas a la costa. Asimismo, se recomienda evitar circular con vehículos por carreteras cercanas a la línea de playa.\nAdemás, se recuerda que está prohibido el baño en las playas en las que se encuentre la bandera roja y siempre se debe evitar acceder al mar en zonas donde haya fuerte oleaje y resaca o que carezcan de servicios de vigilancia y salvamento.\nHasta que finalice esta situación, es conveniente aplazar las actividades náuticas o deportivas y si se dispone de una embarcación, se debe asegurar su amarre en un lugar resguardado.\nEn caso de emergencia, es necesario llamar inmediatamente al 1 1 2.",

    "text": "TACOMA, Wash. — At the\nMuseum of Glass, nine glass vessels hang by the neck in an installation called Strange Fruit.\nChildren's shoes are scattered on a playful surface, the aftershock of some kind of trauma.\nA blue-black heart drips ink down a wall.\nJust some of the pieces you'll find in\n\"A Two Way Mirror\", an exhibition of contemporary Black artists curated by Jabari Owens-Bailey.\n\"I wanted to find something that reflected myself,\" Owens-Bailey said. \"This idea of exploring Black identity through glass hadn't really been done before.\"\nInspired by a 2020 essay,\n\"The Whiteness of Glass\", that revealed fewer than one percent of glass artists are people of color, Owens-Bailey made it his mission to exhibit works from the best Black artists in one place. Most of the well-known glass artists are white men so Owens-Bailey had a challenge.\n\"I started my search, like any other 21st Century researcher, by googling 'Black Art' and 'Glass',\" Owens-Bailey said.\nSome of the names he already knew from their stints as artists in residence at the museum.\nBrooklyn's\nLeo Tecosky uses graffiti iconography in his art while Chris Day, who claims to be the only Black glass artist in England, hopes to inspire conversations about Civil Rights and slavery without ever showing bodies in chains.\n\"I want people to walk away with the knowledge that there are Black people at work right now with this wonderful material,\" Owens-Bailey said. \"I also want to open the door for young people that might want to work in glass. I think that representation matters and once you've seen someone do something it normalizes it for you.\"\nA Two-Way Mirror: Double Consciousness in Contemporary Glass by Black Artists will be on exhibit through October 2024 at the Museum of Glass.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest.
