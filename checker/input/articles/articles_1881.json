    "title": "Drivers battle nasty morning commute as snowstorm blows through",
    "text": "After a snowstorm blew through metro Detroit Friday morning, drivers were forced to deal with slick roads, heavy snow and low visibility. \"This is some real bipolar weather. I don’t know if it’s the Aries coming in or the Pisces leaving. I don’t know which it is for real,\" said as he stopped for gas in Southfield. Friday morning, around 30 crashes were reported on metro Detroit freeways. \"I didn’t think we’d get that much (snow) here either. I don’t know where it came from, but I wish it would go back,\" driver Paul Ayott said after getting on the roads in Macomb County around 8 a.m. Friday. \"For a while, 50 feet, you couldn’t see because it was snowing that powdery little snow. It was no (salt) trucks out. I didn’t see a truck until about 9:30 (in the morning). That’s not to say they weren’t out, they just weren’t out where I was.\" Several drivers echoes the same concerns of a lack of salt trucks on the roads to 7 Action News crews. \"Do you guys feel like the magnitude of this storm caught you off guard at all,\" 7 Action News reporter Whitney Burney asked. \"No, we expected (this). We had forecasts from the National Weather Service, our forecasting services, your meteorologists, so we knew it was going to come. We knew it was going to come hard,\" Bryson says they put the all-hands-on-deck call out for drivers around 3 a.m. and got all 109 of their trucks out by 5 a.m. \"It actually worked out fairly well this morning,\" Bryson said. \"We got them in just before the snow started and they were able to get on the road as the snow was falling. That’s ideal. Unfortunately, when the snow falls very hard and rush hour is picking up and we have bumper to bumper traffic, that makes it very difficult.\" The Macomb County Department of Roads says they ran into the same issue. \"We try and prep as best as possible. We can’t get out too early. So, it just depends when the snowfalls, the duration of the snowfall, if it’s a mixture of freezing rain, freezing temperatures,\" said Bryan Santo, who is the director of the Macomb County Road Department. Santo says their team had all 60 salt trucks working to clear primary roads for much of the day. \"I think our crews were called in around 6 or 7 o'clock to start on the route as far as our salting and plowing of the roadways. We got an early start. We’ll keep our crews over into the evening as long as the duration of the storm continues,\" Santo said. Both Macomb and Oakland counties say they're anticipating being on the roads overnight and possibly into the weekend as more snow is expected Friday evening.",

With pride, he displays a collection of pink roses bearing the images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, alongside inscriptions such as \"Ram Lalla\" and \"Atmanirbhar Bharat.\"\nDriven by the ethos of the 'Make in India' initiative, Bansali handprinted each petal, investing considerable time in the process. His visionary approach extends beyond flowers; he plans to imprint similar images on indoor plant leaves designated for the temple complex.\nDuring the groundbreaking ceremony in 2020, Bansali presented 500 floral creations. This time, with a larger vision, he aspires to produce between 3,000 to 4,000 adorned flowers for the veneration of Lord Ram.\n'Barcodes for change': Congress unveils innovative crowdfunding strategy at 'Hain Taiyyar Hum' rally in Nagpur\nPreparations are in full swing for the seven-day mega ceremony, commencing on January 16.

    "text": "-\ndreamy take that, Vance, you nasty little convert panting after the tradcaths. it’s hard to fuck up converting to Catholicism so bad that you wind up being specifically admonished by the Pope.\nthe actual letter itself is also well worth reading and pulls no punches for a Catholic audience; it’s the kind of reading someone for filth you can only pull off from someone who knows you very well and shares a lot of theoretical values with you. on a theological level, invoking the thirty days of wandering lost in the desert, Jesus as a god-become-man, and Joseph-Mary-and-Jesus in Nazareth as refugees are all extremely powerful metaphors within context; so is invoking the story of the Good Samaritan as the source of the central insight in the fullest maturity of humankind.\nThen he ends by speaking to three groups. The first is American Catholic bishops, who he very pointedly praises for the efforts to support immigrants and refugees they are most assuredly making, for which God will of course reward them. (The American bishopric as a whole is a particularly conservative faction among international Catholicism and in fact most recently had a scandal when the second Catholic US president ever was elected in 2020 and a bunch of them threw fits at the idea of congratulating the new President on account of it was Biden; the Pope, by contrast, is a Jesuit out of Argentina whose parents fled Mussolini, and he is not into that shit.)\nThe second group he addresses is American lay Catholics and “all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.” He’s just taken some time to extremely clearly demand that the lay faithful “consider the legitimacy of norms and public policies in the light of the dignity of the person and his or her fundamental rights, not vice versa,” and otherwise strongly imply that unjust laws should be opposed by as many of the citizenry as possible. In that light, he’s juuuuuuuuuuuust one level of plausible deniability away from calling for all Catholics to oppose this administration, root and stem, as a grave matter of high-stakes faith.\nThen he ends by invoking Mary to protect all refugees and immigrants worldwide, just to really grind it in where his concern lies and what he thinks people of good conscience should do. it’s written very strongly and very sharply. deeply satisfying to read, thank you, and about what you’d expect from the first pope ever to name himself for St Francis of Assisi.\n-\nfrog-sama420liked thiscaptainwiticismsliked thistheneverfadinglandsliked thisgreypistacchioliked thisthot-criminalliked thisillya-romareblogged this fromharpersgonnaharpkindacynicalliked thisaavjoliked thisdiscomoondayliked thisbleedinghearthypocritreblogged this fromsee-arcaneim-not-the-one-youre-looking-forreblogged this fromsparrowpostingharpersgonnaharpreblogged this fromjustnoodlefishthingsharpersgonnaharpliked thisrainbow-spinelli13liked this[bloodanddarknesss](https://bloodanddarknesss.tumblr.com/post/775636913078009856)reblogged this from[squeeful](https://squeeful.tumblr.com/)[penguintreblemaker](https://penguintreblemaker.tumblr.com/)liked this[poststoshow](https://poststoshow.tumblr.com/post/775636852996702208)reblogged this from[mostly-funnytwittertweets](https://mostly-funnytwittertweets.tumblr.com/)[blueravencat](https://blueravencat.tumblr.com/post/775636816926785537)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[damoclesangel](https://damoclesangel.tumblr.com/)liked this[catholicwaifu](https://catholicwaifu.tumblr.com/post/775636793195380736)reblogged this from[r-r-raf](https://r-r-raf.tumblr.com/)[plontsrcool](https://plontsrcool.tumblr.com/)liked this[goldpilot22](https://goldpilot22.tumblr.com/)liked this[blueravencat](https://blueravencat.tumblr.com/)liked this[regina-del-cielo](https://regina-del-cielo.tumblr.com/)liked this[lessbien-every-day](https://lessbien-every-day.tumblr.com/)liked this[octaviangrey](https://octaviangrey.tumblr.com/)liked this[woodenpizza123](https://woodenpizza123.tumblr.com/)liked this[octaviangrey](https://octaviangrey.tumblr.com/post/775636507656585216)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[powerpun](https://powerpun.tumblr.com/post/775636492251955200)reblogged this from[paranoidgemsbok](https://paranoidgemsbok.tumblr.com/)[doctordestiny](https://doctordestiny.tumblr.com/)liked this[s0r3wach1gauy0](https://s0r3wach1gauy0.tumblr.com/post/775636454264242176)reblogged this from[cwnerd12](https://cwnerd12.tumblr.com/)[goldendaysofsummer](https://goldendaysofsummer.tumblr.com/post/775636309964374016)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[msflora-lynn](https://msflora-lynn.tumblr.com/)liked this[goldendaysofsummer](https://goldendaysofsummer.tumblr.com/)liked this[blackcatcoven](https://blackcatcoven.tumblr.com/post/775636208791502848)reblogged this from[fagreus](https://fagreus.tumblr.com/)[blackcatcoven](https://blackcatcoven.tumblr.com/)liked this[s0r3wach1gauy0](https://s0r3wach1gauy0.tumblr.com/)liked this[weird-and-gifted](https://weird-and-gifted.tumblr.com/post/775636130342322176)reblogged this from[musicalhell](https://musicalhell.tumblr.com/)[heavypicklebrokemydundunheart](https://heavypicklebrokemydundunheart.tumblr.com/)liked this[lucinata](https://lucinata.tumblr.com/)liked this[lucinata](https://lucinata.tumblr.com/post/775636087373709312)reblogged this from[helluvamystery](https://helluvamystery.tumblr.com/)[zuzypiia](https://zuzypiia.tumblr.com/)liked this[thylacinetears](https://thylacinetears.tumblr.com/)liked this[luv-not-hate](https://luv-not-hate.tumblr.com/post/775635958878060544)reblogged this from[sideguitars](https://sideguitars.tumblr.com/)[luv-not-hate](https://luv-not-hate.tumblr.com/)liked this[leighrobertsreads](https://leighrobertsreads.tumblr.com/)liked this[mostly-funnytwittertweets](https://mostly-funnytwittertweets.tumblr.com/)posted this[Show more notes](https://last-on-your-lips.tumblr.com)",

Sono previste precipitazioni intense, anche a carattere di temporali, sulle seguenti zone della Campania: 1 (Piana Campana, Napoli, Isole, Area Vesuviana); 2 (Alto Volturno e Matese); 3 (Penisola Sorrentino-Amalfitana, Monti di Sarno e Monti Picentini); 5 (Tusciano e Alto Sele); 6 (Piana del Sele e Alto Cilento); 8 (Basso Cilento).\nLa Protezione Civile della Campania ricorda che, vista l'allerta gialla per rischio idrogeologico, gli agenti atmosferici previsti potrebbero provocare anche i seguenti fenomeni: allagamenti, esondazioni, innalzamento dei livelli idrometrici dei corsi d'acqua, caduta massi e frane, in considerazione della fragilità dei territori.\nInfine, la Protezione Civile raccomanda i sindaci di attivare i COC (Centri Operativi Comunali) e di attuare tutte le misure adeguate a prevenire, mitigare e contrastare i fenomeni meteorologici previsti. A Napoli, in virtù dell'allerta meteo, il Comune ha deciso di tenere chiusi i parchi e le spiagge comunali, nonché l'Arenile di Bagnoli.",

    "title": "Philippines Mobilizes 1 Million Farmers to Combat El Niño and Transform Agriculture",
    "text": "In an ambitious move to combat the effects of the El Niño phenomenon and fulfill a presidential directive, the Department of Agriculture in the Philippines has mobilized an army of over 1 million farmers, introducing them to water-saving technology. This initiative, part of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s broader agenda to bolster the agricultural sector, leverages innovative strategies like Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Quick Turnaround (QTA) to mitigate the impact of climate variability on farming. With replanting efforts already underway across more than 5,500 hectares of rice farms, the government's proactive stance signals a transformative period for Philippine agriculture amid environmental challenges.\nEmpowering Farmers through Task Force El Niño\nIn response to the looming threat of El Niño, the Philippine government has launched Task Force El Niño, a comprehensive aid program aimed at equipping 4,000 affected farmers with the tools and resources needed to weather the phenomenon. This includes the distribution of seeds for alternative crops more resilient to dry conditions and the repair of vital irrigation canals. The initiative not only underscores the government's commitment to sustainable farming practices but also reflects a strategic shift towards ensuring food security and farmer welfare in the face of climatic adversities.\nRevolutionizing Agriculture with F2C2\nAmid budgetary adjustments, President Marcos Jr.'s visionary Farm and Fisheries Clustering and Consolidation (F2C2) initiative has made significant strides in transforming the landscape of Philippine agriculture. With a focus on accelerating the consolidation of small farms to achieve economies of scale, the F2C2 program has successfully catalyzed the formation of 711 new empowered clusters, benefitting 484,396 farmers and fisherfolk across various agricultural sectors. This strategic move, inspired by successful models from neighboring countries like Taiwan, aims to enhance productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness in the agricultural sector through collaboration and innovation.\nA Blueprint for Agricultural Advancement\nThe Philippine government has outlined a comprehensive strategy to jumpstart the development of the agricultural sector. Key initiatives include the promotion of farm clustering, the establishment of a farmers and fishery registry, and the integration of satellite imaging and digital technology to improve farming practices. By shifting the focus from traditional crops like rice to a more diversified crop portfolio and engaging the private sector in agricultural development, the government aims to foster a more resilient, efficient, and scientifically-driven agricultural sector. These efforts, underscored by an emphasis on efficient resource use and private sector participation, herald a new era of growth and prosperity for Philippine agriculture.\nIn a testament to his commitment to the welfare of farmers, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has championed various government programs aimed at enhancing their yield and income. Recognizing the vital role of agriculture in the nation's economy and the hard work of its farmers, the President's initiatives reflect a profound dedication to supporting and transforming the agricultural sector. As these programs begin to take root, the future of Philippine agriculture looks promising, with the potential for increased productivity, sustainability, and economic upliftment for farmers nationwide.",

    "text": "By Dan Gooding ,\n1 hour ago\nA newly-graduated teenager who vanished from a four-day party had a fractured skull, broken ribs and his teeth were scattered around him when he was found naked and dead on the side of a rural highway in Oklahoma.\nMystery surrounds the final moments of Noah Presgrove, 19, who told friends he was leaving the party to go for a walk. His body was found about a mile away on the side of US 81 in Jefferson County, Oklahoma on Labor Day, 2023.\nOklahoma Highway Patrol described Presgrove’s death as “suspicious” in mid-September but now, seven months later, with the investigation into his death seemingly gone quiet, his family are speaking out and revealing the harrowing nature of his injuries.\nPresgrove, described as goofy, fearless and hilarious by family, had recently graduated from Comanche High School and was enjoying a summer off before he planned to join the military.\nHe’d been at a four-day 22nd birthday party when, friends say, he decided to go for a walk but couldn’t find one of his shoes so he took another instead.\nWhat happened after remains a mystery.\nPresgrove’s family say they have not been allowed to see the Medical Examiner’s report outlining his cause fo death.\nWhen he was found, he was naked except for a pair of mismatched shoes.\nHis aunt Robyn Smith told NewsNation: “There was a wound to the back of his head, different skull fractures. He had ribs broken, and it was all on the left side,” earlier this week.\nNoah’s teeth were found scattered on the ground, she said, while he had rashes from road gravel on his shoulder and hip.\nMs Smith said her nephew’s body was severely bruised and swollen when the family saw it at the funeral home, with his fingertips appearing to be “shredded”.\n“They said that they didn’t think that this was from a vehicle,” Ms Smith told the outlet. “There was no indication of any kind of injuries to the lower half of his body.”\nCousins who spoke to KFOR described Noah as “fearless”, “goofy”, and “hilarious”.\n“At the end of the day, what we know is that he lost his life,” cousin Lindsay Fowler told KFOR .\n“He was found on the side of the highway. And it appears that he was dumped there and someone knows what happened. And we want to know what happened.”\nRelatives feel that instead of answers, the OHP has left them in the dark.\nMany of Noah’s cousins, aunts and grandparents have been active on a Facebook page called “Justice for Noah Presgrave”, seeking to raise awareness of his case and pressure authorities for answers.\nA spokesperson for the OHP would only tell The Independent that “the investigation is still ongoing”, while the OSBI deferred to the OHP.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
