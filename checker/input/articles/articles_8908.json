    "title": "Recommended for your garden in the south of Spain: Astelia chathamica",
    "text": "Sections Highlight Denise Bush Malaga Friday, 5 July 2024, 15:08 Opciones para compartir Native to New Zealand, Astelia chathamica is an epiphyte which can be found growing in the apex of tree branches and on cliff faces in its native environment. Commonly called silver spear and Maori flax, the genus has many species and hybrids, varying only in height and width of leaf. A. chathamica is one of the largest species, growing up to 1.5 metres high. The dramatic foliage, pale green on the top and silvery white underneath, makes it an ideal specimen plant, suitable for a large container, for growing on walls and in rockeries or in mass plantings. They are dioecious plants and the males can be distinguished from the females by their flowers which form on long, slender stems. Male plants have tiny dark-green, scented flowers and the female plants have tiny, pale-green, unscented flowers. The female plants will produce orange or red berries although they are often not conspicuous as they form low down inside the foliage. Astelia chathamica is not completely drought resistant and needs a rich, well-drained soil. It will not withstand cold and wet so may need protection in the winter. It will however tolerate winds and coastal locations. An ideal spot would be where it will receive dappled shade; in full sun it may suffer scorching of the leaves. It will also not survive hard frosts. Maintenance is low: apart from regular watering the dead and dying leaves should be removed to keep it tidy and it should be given a slow release feed in the spring. The genus name Astelia comes from the Greek 'a' meaning 'without' and 'stele' meaning 'trunk' or 'pillar'. Astelia was previously in the Liliaceae plant family but now has its own, Asteliaceae.

Ieri e l’altro ieri è stato in città un gruppo di ingegneri ambientali della Sogesid Spa, società di ingegneria “in house providing” del Ministero dell’Ambiente e della Sicurezza Energetica e del Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti. I tecnici di Sogesid coordinati dal direttore generale dell’Area Tecnica, Carlo Messina, sono stati accompagnati dal Commissario straordinario delegato al Sin di Crotone Emilio Errigo, alla Cittadella regionale di Catanzaro dove hanno incontrato il direttore del Dipartimento ambiente e territorio Salvatore Siviglia. Alla riunione erano presenti anche il dirigente di settore Giovanni Aramini e il Commissario straordinario Arpacal, Michelangelo Iannone. Durante l’incontro, gli ingegneri ambientali di Sogesid si sono soffermati con particolare attenzione, sulle tre aree del Sin allo stato contaminate. La prima, necessita della caratterizzazione dei sedimenti, risorse biologiche, ittiche, acque marine, fluviali, fondali e sottofondi marittimi antistanti ed adiacenti le ex aree industriali, Pertusola, Agricoltura, Sasol e Fosfotec (oggi Eni Rewind S.p.A., Kroton Gress e Edison S.p.A.).

    "title": "'Growing, diversifying and modernizing': 80 year after Trinity blast, nuclear weapons remain a threat | Local News | santafenewmexican.com",
    "text": "It's a peaceful time of day at 5:29 a.m. Quiet.\nIn that predawn moment 80 years ago, Allen Sánchez said, his grandfather was milking cows in Tomé. A light appeared as the first test of a nuclear weapon occurred to the south, at what is now White Sands Missile Range.\nThe development of the atomic bomb — and its detonation at Trinity Site on July 16, 1945 — forever changed the landscapes of New Mexico, the country and the world.\nEighty years later, the powerful weapons that killed over 200,000 people in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945 — and later left countless people in communities near testing sites like Trinity with decades of health effects — remain an ever-present threat, even after a dramatic decrease in the number of nuclear warheads worldwide since a height in the mid-1980s.\n\"My grandfather said it was like a sun that rose and set,\" said Sánchez, president and mission leader of the Albuquerque nonprofit CommonSpirit St. Joseph’s Children, during a vigil Sunday for the 80th anniversary of the Trinity test. \"Except it hasn't set.\"\nWhere in the world are nuclear weapons?\nCurrently, nine countries — Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — possess nuclear weapons.\nAt the beginning of 2025, there were roughly 12,200 nuclear warheads worldwide, according to estimates from the Federation of American Scientists. The United States and Russia hold the lion's share.\nIn September 2023, the U.S. had about 3,750 nuclear weapons, plus 2,000 that had been retired and were awaiting disarmament. More than 12,000 weapons in the country have been disarmed since 1994. The Federation of American Scientists estimates Russia has around 4,300.\nIn the decades after the Trinity Test, the U.S. and what was then the Soviet Union scrambled to increase their stockpiles. In 1986, there were more than 60,000 nuclear warheads worldwide; like today, the majority were held by the two dueling nations.\nIt was a turning point. That same year, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev met in Reykjavík, Iceland. The following year, the Soviet Union and the U.S. signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\nOver the next four decades, the number of nuclear warheads worldwide fell by more than 80%.\nBut even one could wreak havoc.\nThe power of a nuclear weapon, or \"yield,\" is measured in the amount of energy produced in kilotons — equal to the explosive output of 1,000 tons of TNT.\nThe bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 16 kilotons and 21 kilotons, respectively. Together, they killed more than 200,000 people, according to estimates.\nToday, large military nuclear weapons are often measured in megatons, not kilotons — a unit of measurement 1,000 times more potent.\nFor high-yield nuclear weapons, heat is the biggest initial concern, according to a fact sheet from the Department of Homeland Security. A fireball produced by the initial explosion can reach tens of millions of degrees and light additional fires throughout the blast zone.\nShockwaves from nuclear weapons would also ripple through a city, causing damage to people and structures.\nAtmospheric ionization after the blast likely would send out an electromagnetic pulse that could knock out electronic equipment.\nOnce the mushroom cloud blooms, radioactive fallout drops to the earth, bringing the threat of radiation sickness and long-term health effects for anyone in its shadow.\nGeopolitical tensions: More perilous than ever?\nThe United States' nuclear posture has historically been one of deterrence. The theory goes that if two countries both have a good hand of cards, neither will make a move due to fear of retaliation. In that vein, the nation's nuclear triad — nuclear weapons deployed by land, sea and air — is maintained so the deterrent is more than a bluff.\nLast year, officials said that strategy may have to shift to accommodate increasingly adversarial relationships with nuclear countries.\n\"We are now in a world where we're facing multiple nuclear competitors, multiple states that are growing, diversifying and modernizing their nuclear arsenals and also, unfortunately, prioritizing the role that nuclear weapons play in their national security strategies,\" said Richard C. Johnson, who served as the nation's deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and countering weapons of mass destruction policy. Johnson was speaking in November in Washington at a panel on nuclear issues.\nRussia, China and North Korea are all risks, stated a 2024 report on the nation's nuclear employment strategy.\n\"Any one of these nuclear challenges would be formidable itself, but the evidence of growing collaboration and collusion between Russia, the [People's Republic of China], the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea], and Iran makes the situation even more challenging,\" the report stated.\nDylan Spaulding, a senior scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists' global security program, said although the number of nuclear warheads has decreased, in some ways, the situation is more perilous than ever.\nThe nation is moving away from stockpile stewardship and further toward modernization programs, including the production of new plutonium pits at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, Spaulding said.\nSince the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no other country has deployed a nuclear weapon. But that doesn't mean countries that own them have been peaceful.\nRussia is locked in war with neighboring Ukraine. Israel and Iran warred briefly earlier this year. The U.S. military attacked three military sites in Iran in an effort to destroy the nation's nuclear program. In May, India and Pakistan had a military skirmish after a terrorist attack killed approximately two dozen people in Kashmir.\n\"All nine of the nuclear nations either have been directly involved or providing support for military conflict in the last 12 months, which is sort of staggering to think about,\" Spaulding said.\nSpeaking at Sunday's vigil at St. Pius X High School in Albuquerque, Santa Fe Archbishop John C. Wester said the nuclear weapons feared in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis were \"pop guns\" compared to today's weapons.\nPope Francis, who died earlier this year, was a champion for disarmament. Built on his memory, Wester said, the archdioceses of Santa Fe, Seattle and Nagasaki and the Diocese of Hiroshima have joined together to \"remember the destruction caused by nuclear weapons, to journey together to prevent nuclear harm and to prevent against future nuclear harm.\"\nThat doesn't mean the immediate tossing of nuclear weapons, Wester said, but a gradual, verified move away from the weapons by all countries.\n\"We're not advocating for unilateral disarmament,\" Wester said. \"That would be suicide.\"\nWester told The New Mexican that while he can't speak for the new leader of the Vatican, he believes Pope Leo XIV, an Augustinian, would be \"in line\" with the late Pope Francis' views on nuclear weapons and disarmament.\n\"He's definitely his own man,\" Wester said. \"… But I think very much he's already indicated clearly, when the United States bombed Iran, their facilities and nuclear facilities, he indicated clearly [that] was not the answer.\"\nBig dollars for weapons in New Mexico\nIn a February news conference, President Donald Trump said he would like to meet with China and Russia to discuss slowing down nuclear development.\nThe world has enough nuclear weapons as it is, Trump said — \"we could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over\" — and the three nations are spending massive amounts to maintain and expand their stockpiles.\n\"Denuclearize,\" Trump said. \"What a beautiful term that is.\"\nBut documents on the Department of Energy and Department of Defense budgets show major increases for nuclear weapons.\nIn New Mexico — which has, since the time of the Manhattan Project, played a key role in national defense — that means big increases for Los Alamos National Laboratory.\nAfter manufacturing a diamond-stamped plutonium pit — the hollow, spherical trigger device for nuclear weapons — last year, Los Alamos National Laboratory is looking at a $5.7 billion budget for fiscal year 2026, up 17% from its previous budget.\nSandia National Laboratories is also looking at an increased budget in the upcoming fiscal year, although a much smaller one.\nThe increases come as other Department of Energy programs — namely spending on renewable energy and national laboratories managed by the Office of Science — are facing major cuts.\nBut one program was a winner in the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" The budget reinstated and expanded a program known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which was allowed to expire last year.\nThe expansion will include more opportunities for New Mexicans to receive compensation. Previously, only people who participated on-site in weapons testing, those who mined uranium before 1971 and \"downwinders\" affected by nuclear weapons testing in Nevada were eligible for the one-time compensation, not those affected by the 1945 Trinity test.\nNow, New Mexico downwinders who lived in the state at least a year between 1944 and 1962 and developed eligible radiogenic cancers, as well as all uranium mine and mill employees employed between 1942 and 1990, can receive up to $100,000 in compensation.\nLoretta Anderson, co-founder of the Southwest Uranium Miners Coalition Post 71, said she felt \"shock\" and \"disbelief\" over the passage.\nAnderson first became involved in the fight to bring compensation to uranium miners in 2014. She was working in a home health care office and saw that many miners who had worked after 1971 were getting conflicting advice about filing for benefits.\nShe also is the daughter of uranium mine employees. Her mother and father worked at the Jackpile-Paguate Mine at Laguna Pueblo, once the largest open-pit uranium mine in the world. Both of her parents were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\"The big boom in the '70s … that was our main source of of work, was working at the uranium mines,\" Anderson said.\nBut the fight isn't over, Anderson said, not until the RECA program is extended past 2028 and abandoned uranium mining sites are cleaned up.\n\"They haven't cleaned up the mess they left us,\" Anderson said.",

    "text": "A 310th Space Wing Airman received the 2024 Citizen Honors Service Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society for leading his non-profit organization, TACT (Teaching the Autism Community Trades), for being the most successful training-to-employment program in Colorado, March 25.\nSenior Airman Danny Combs, a space systems operator assigned to the 310th Space Wing’s 4th Space Warning Squadron, at Buckley Space Force Base, Colorado, gave up his musical career as a guitarist working with famous musicians like Taylor Swift and Faith Hill to found TACT in 2016 and carve out a program designed to teach people with autism a skilled trade and find employment.\nCombs started TACT for his son, Dylan, now 15, who was diagnosed with autism at age 2 because he refused to accept the limitations placed on him by therapists.\n“It was always your son needs to ‘work on this or that,’ but never on his successes,” said Combs. “I could have continued my career (as a musician) and given my son a great future, but what about everyone else’s kids?”\nWith concern for his son and the well-being of others, Combs sought his grandfather’s advice, “You have debated this for a while. Go further. Space is the way to go.” This led him to enlisting into the Air Force Reserve in 2020 at 39 years old.\nRecognizing the work of his non-profit, the Secretary of the Air Force office of diversity and inclusion asked him to give a presentation on autism to the Air Force Neurodiversity Board last year.\nAccording to the U.S. Air Force Medical Standards Directory ADS (autism spectrum disorder), is not disqualifying factor for continued military service unless it is currently compromising military duty or training. After meeting members who have been delayed in their initial entry and others who have avoided treatment because of neurodivergent stigmas Combs said, “That’s wild in 2024, that those [stigmas] still exists. So [we are] trying to create a society that recognizes the value that they bring to the table that make everybody’s lives better.”\nCombs, who is also co-chair of Neurodiverse Air Force, has petitioned the Pentagon to initiate a study on service by neurodivergent individuals in the Department of Defense. He hopes the DoD will adapt UDL (Universal Design for Learning) which institutes flexible teaching to create equal opportunities of success. The federally funded study aims to improve recruitment, management and retention of neurodivergent servicemembers and civilian employees. Combs said, “When we make things inclusive, everybody wins.”\nThe Congressional Medal of Honor Society – Citizen Honors states, “Ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Whether they happen in a single instance of bravery or through continued service to others, acts of courage and self-sacrifice symbolize the American spirit.”\n|Date Taken:||03.12.2024|\n|Date Posted:||04.18.2024 18:05|\n|Story ID:||468896|\n|Location:||COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, US|\n|Web Views:||0|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, Colorado reservist awarded Citizen Honors Service Award, by\n[TSgt Devon Cole](/portfolio/1801282/devon-cole), identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.\nNo keywords found.",

    "text": "Vulnerability revealed by Ivanti has been exploited by the same group that targeted Connect Secure from January 2024.\nCredit: janews / Shutterstock Researchers from Google’s Mandiant division believe the critical remote code execution vulnerability patched on Wednesday by software vendor Ivanti has been exploited since mid-December by a Chinese cyberespionage group. This is the same group that has exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances back in January 2024 and throughout the year.\nThe latest attacks, exploiting the new CVE-2025-0282 flaw , involved the deployment of multiple malware components from a toolkit dubbed SPAWN that Mandiant attributes to a cluster of activity tracked as UNC5337, which the company suspects is related to another group tracked as UNC5221.\n“​​UNC5221 is a suspected China-nexus espionage actor that exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, which impacted Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Ivanti Policy Security appliances as early as December 2023,” the Mandiant researchers said in a report . “Additionally, Mandiant previously observed UNC5221 leveraging a likely ORB network of compromised Cyberoam appliances to enable intrusion operations.”\nThe SPAWN family of custom malware tools, some of which are specifically designed to interact with Connect Secure features and code, include the SPAWNANT installer, SPAWNMOLE tunneler, the SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor and the SPAWNSLOTH log tampering utility. In addition to these known tools that have been used in past Ivanti compromises, the latest attacks also involved never before seen components such as a credential harvester dubbed DRYHOOK and a malware dropper called PHASEJAM.\nMalware prevents legitimate upgrades In its security advisory, Ivanti directed customers to perform a factory reset on appliances before deploying the patched 22.7R2.5 version. The company did not go into details as to why but based on Mandiant’s analysis it’s because of the PHASEJAM dropper which modifies multiple legitimate Connect Secure components, including the one responsible for system upgrades. It does this in order to block and then simulate upgrades in a visually convincing way, even displaying the new version number at the end of the process.\n“The first technique, utilized by PHASEJAM, prevents legitimate ICS [Ivanti Connect Secure] system upgrade attempts by administrators via rendering a fake HTML upgrade progress bar while silently blocking the legitimate upgrade process,” the Mandiant researchers explain. “Due to the blocked upgrade attempt, the technique would allow any installed backdoors or tools left by the threat actor to persist on the current running version of the VPN while giving the appearance of a successful upgrade.”\nPHASEJAM also modifies legitimate files from the ICS web interface in order to inject a web shell that gives attackers remote access to the device, the ability to execute additional malicious code and to exfiltrate data from the device.\nPHASEJAM comes in the form of a bash script and is deployed as a payload following the initial exploit for CVE-2025-0282 after some preparation steps that involve disabling the SELinux protections of the OS, blocking system log collection and remounting the root partition as writable so its files can be modified.\nFollowing the exploitation, the attackers perform several steps to remove evidence of the attack including clearing kernel messages and removing entries from debug logs, deleting troubleshoot information packages and any memory core dumps generated by crashes that could be used in forensics analysis, removing application event log entries related to various failures, crashes and certificate handling errors, and clearing the SELinux audit log of executed commands.\nPersistence across upgrades In addition to blocking and simulating upgrades, the attackers deploy a mechanism to survive legitimate upgrades if they do happen. Normally the root partition is wiped during an upgrade as it’s supposed to be read-only, so the attackers hijack the execution flow of dspkginstall, a legitimate utility used during the upgrade process, in order to copy several malicious components to the temporary upgrade partition that’s mounted on /tmp/data/.\n“SPAWNANT establishes an additional method of backdoor access by writing a web shell into compcheckresult.cgi on the upgrade partition,” the researchers explained. “The web shell uses system() to execute the value passed to a hard-coded query parameter.”\nSPAWNANT has three components: the SPAWNMOLE tunneler (libsocks5.so), the SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor (libsshd.so) and the SPAWNSLOTH log tampering utility (.liblogblock.so). It also tricks the Ivanti Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) by recalculating the SHA256 hash for any files it has modified and generates a new RSA key pair to sign the modified manifest that the ICT uses for integrity checking.\nMandiant notes that there is still a way to tell successful and correct ICT reports from tampered ones due to the number of steps listed. Screenshots with the differences are provided in their analysis.\nLateral movement and credential theft The APT group uses built-in command line tools such as nmap and dig to perform network reconnaissance and tries to perform LDAP queries using the LDAP service account or to access Active Directory servers, through SMB and RDP.\nA Python script dubbed DRYHOOK modifies a system component called DSAuth.pm to intercept legitimate authentications on the appliance and log credentials. Separately, the attackers attempt to exfiltrate the appliance database which contains VPN session cookies, API keys, certificates and credential material.\n“Mandiant assesses that defenders should be prepared for widespread, opportunistic exploitation, likely targeting credentials and the deployment of web shells to provide future access,” the researchers said. “Additionally, if proof-of-concept exploits for CVE-2025-0282 are created and released, Mandiant assesses it is likely additional threat actors may attempt targeting Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.”",
