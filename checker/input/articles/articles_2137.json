The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii.\nA video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance.\nSuddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves.\nAnother angle captured by Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him down the street.\nOfficials urged people to avoid the ocean.

    "text": "The Ada News, Okla. Conduit Coders make history Mike Arie, The Ada News, Okla. Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:55 PM UTC 5 min read\nDec. 26—In a season full of accomplishments, the Conduit Coders saved its biggest for last as they claimed not one but two national championships.\nThe youth coding league team, sponsored by the Ada Jobs Foundation through a grant from Build to Scale, won both the fifth-sixth grade and seventh-eighth grade divisions. No team in the Youth Coding League had ever accomplished this feat.\n\"The Conduit Coders continue to grow and shine even brighter than before, outdoing their previous accomplishments and soaring to new heights,\" coach Sunnie Dawn Baker said. \"In our first season, we finished seventh, and last year we were second.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Fall 2024 season has been a time of exciting growth and new achievements. The Conduit Coders expanded its reach with coders from five different school districts: Ada, Byng, Latta, Roff, and Vanoss. This season, the team also added a seventh-eighth grade team.\nWhile adding teams had always been a possibility, it became a priority when several coders from the previous years were about to age out of the program.\n\"The Ada Jobs Foundation envisions a seamless pipeline of technological knowledge and training that guides students from fifth grade through higher education or into the workforce,\" Carol Ervin, President of the Ada Jobs Foundation.\n\"While the current program focuses on grades 5-8, students face a two-year gap before they can begin studying at Pontotoc Technology Center as high school juniors. Baker and her colleagues are working to bridge this gap, aiming to provide students with a continuous pathway into the digital economy—whether as skilled workers or entrepreneurs.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement This year, the Youth Coding League debuted its curriculum. In the past, they had been using pre-made courses that Google CS First designed. However, they wanted to make sure the program accurately reflected their goals and values, in particular the encouragement of the entrepreneurial spirit being a priority.\nThe theme for the 5th and 6th grade divisions was food. The students were encouraged to explore agriculture technology while also considering how to transform their food innovations into businesses. They worked on designing websites for both information and online ordering, as well as coding projects that could calculate costs and profit margins.\nOnce the regular season was completed, they were challenged with a postseason prompt that asked them to \"design a solution to a problem you see that involves food.\" While there were many great ideas, two projects advanced to the finals.\nThe \"Baby Albino Monkeys,\" a team comprised of Bradalyn Pinley (Roff 5th) and Kayne Scott (Roff 6th) developed a project around the dangers of expired foods, including several games for the users to play. Their project earned fifth place nationally in the Community Favorite category.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Sports Bowl game schedule today: Breaking down the three college football bowl games on Dec. 26 USA TODAY Sports United in ‘survival’ mode as Amorim responds to threat of INCREDIBLE relegation Hayters TV Mike Tomlin sums up loss to Steelers perfectly with 2 words Steelers Wire Alabama transfer running back announces commitment to Big Ten program Roll Tide Wire \"Fin Fury,\" a brother-sister duo made up of Valor Wilkerson (Ada 5th) and Dalton Wilkerson (Ada 6th), was in the Technical Merit selection from the Conduit Coders. They developed a project where they tackled the challenges of overfishing with an engaging story and several games. Their project earned third place.\nIn the 7/8 grade division, the theme this season was \"The Greater Good.\" The program challenged coders to examine people and organizations in their communities who were making a positive impact and solving problems. The program emphasized the importance of collecting and sharing data, developing a website or app, planning events, and creating commercials to advocate for a cause. In the postseason, they were asked to \"build a solution using technology that makes the world a better place.\"\nThe project that earned the Technical Merit award for this division also became the Community Favorite, advancing to the final round of community voting. Eli Priddle (Ada 7th), William Walters (Ada 7th), and Caisen Herrera (Latta 7th), working as \"The Three Coderteers,\" designed a complex project to help the homeless by providing warm and secure sleep pods that could be delivered directly to those in need.\nWhile the Youth Coding League teaches these coders the basic principles of coding logic, such as utilizing if/then statements, loops, variables, and object-oriented programming, it also teaches them many soft skills.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement They learn how to take constructive criticism and apply it to their projects, revising and improving their work right up to the due date. Along the way, they develop critical thinking skills and perseverance-when their code encounters issues, they keep trying until they find a solution.\nThey also learn the importance of missing deadlines, as missing one impacts the entire team. Most importantly, they understand the value of fulfilling their obligations and commitments, lessons that will serve them well in the future and make them valuable members of their communities.\nTheir commitment and perseverance certainly paid off. Not only did the team achieve first place status, as well as having projects place in the postseason finals, but a total of ten coders were ranked in the top ten in between the two divisions. For the 7th and 8th grade division, Caisen Herrera (Latta 7th) came in tenth, Jake Blanck (Ada 7th) came in ninth, Logan Parnell (Vanoss 8th) came in eighth, and Eli Priddle (Ada 7th) took first place.\nFor the 5th and 6th grade division, six students tied for 1st place in individual standings: Sophia Baker (Ada 6th), Jameson Thompson (Byng 6th), Bradalyn Pinley (Roff 5th), Valor Wilkerson (Ada 5th), Josephine Berman (Ada 5th), and Hadley Howry (Ada 5th). In total, these coders earned $1,950 in prize money, along with kindles and wireless speakers awarded to teams for postseason success.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"Coach Baker and the whole team at the Ada Jobs Foundation continue to be proud of the coders and cannot wait to see what they create in the 2024 Spring season,\" Ervin said. \"This coming year the team will continue to grow and the students are excited about the new themes. The 5th and 6th graders will be exploring ideas around space, while the 7th and 8th graders will be delving into the world of game development.\n\"While the Youth Coding League shapes the lives of its participants, it also influences the broader community. I am incredibly excited and proud of our nationally ranked coding team right here in Ada. Emerging industries often look into programs like these when researching communities to invest in, both now and in the future.\"\nThrough Conduit Coders, we are investing in these individuals, but we are also investing in the future of our community as a whole.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "Una familia mendocina se hizo viral en TikTok luego de publicar un video en el que se los veía disfrutando la Navidad hasta que la apertura de los regalos cambió el humor en el ambiente. En las imágenes se veía como uno de los yernos de la familia recibió una camiseta de la Lepra por parte de su suegro, pero él es hincha del Tomba, el clásico rival mendocino del equipo. Toda la escena, y su llamativo desenlace, fue compartida en la red social TikTok donde video cuenta con más de 1 millón de visualizaciones y 83 mil ‘Me gusta’.\nLos familiares se dieron cuenta que la camiseta era de Independiente Rivadavia, también conocido como “La Lepra”, y no tardaron en reírse de la situación. Se nota en la cara del tombino que el regalo no le hacía gracia y no se la quiso ni probar.\nSe ve además como el hombre le recrimina a su hija diciendo “me dijiste que era de la Lepra” e inmediatamente ella le responde “era del Tomba, papá” completamente incrédula de la situación. La coincidencia no podía ser peor ya que el chico nunca iba a usar su regalo.\nAlgunos familiares quisieron poner paños fríos a la situación y le dijeron que use la camiseta de todas formas, ya que la de Independiente Rivadavia y la de Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba tienen en común el color azul.\n“Igual, es azul” o “Ponetela igual” fueron los comentarios que recibió el chico mientras guardaba su regalo. En el tiktok se puede ver la incomodidad que ocultaba el mismo y la incredibilidad del resto de las personas presentes.\nCasi al final del video se ve cómo el suegro trae otra bolsa en la mano y dice “siempre compro algo más por las dudas” y fue allí cuando le entregó una camiseta del Tomba a su yerno. En ese momento, todos entendieron que todo era una broma planeado por el hombre y estallaron las carcajadas.\nPara la suerte de todos, el hincha de Godoy Cruz se mostró muy simpático ante la situación. Es más, ahí si quiso probarse la camiseta. Para cerrar la broma, yerno y suegro se abrazaron amistosamente y disfrutaron del momento que alegró la noche.\nEn los más de 500 comentarios que recibió el video viral, algunos usuarios se compadecieron del chico. Uno señaló: “Pobre se puso todo tímido, siento que no quería ser mal agradecido, era un regalo...”. Otro celebró la broma y dijo: “El mejor suegro tenés capo. Le metió toda la onda”.\nEl gestor de la broma se llevó los aplausos en los comentarios y muchos usuarios pidieron darle más crédito: “Nadie va a hablar de toda la onda que le puso el suegro, el sueño de cualquier persona que le guste el futbol es tener un suegro como él”.\nEl video cuenta con más de un millón de reproducciones y casi 85 mil me gusta en menos de 24 horas en TikTok.",

    "text": "[Capital Humano](/capital-humano)\nLectura 4:00 min\nCurrículum pinocho: 23% de los aplicantes a una vacante no son confiables\nDesde el reclutamiento, hay personas que muestran conductas poco éticas como mentir, manipular pruebas o exagerar conocimientos, lo cual lleva a que su nivel de integridad no sea el que se requiere.\nLa\nética e integridad de los empleados impacta en los resultados de las empresas y su reputación corporativa, señala el Reporte de Integridad Laboral 2024 de Midot. En ese sentido, la confiabilidad de las personas que se postulan a un empleo es importante.\nSegún los resultados del reporte, el 23% de los candidatos en México se clasifican como no confiables en sus evaluaciones de integridad por incumplir estándares establecidos por las empresas, ya sea\nmentir en su currículum o manipular la información solicitada.\nAdemás, el 1% de los evaluados intentaron manipular la prueba apoyándose de ayuda externa, tratando de modificar los tiempos de respuesta o brindando respuestas inconclusas.\nEn Latinoamérica, el 69% de las personas que aplica una vacante y se catalogaron como no recomendable son hombres, mientras que 31% son mujeres.\nEl reporte indica que las cifras concuerdan con los porcentajes de fraude cometido en las organizaciones de la región, los cuales son ejecutas por los hombres en 86% de los casos y sólo 14% son atribuibles a mujeres.\nMentir en el reclutamiento está normalizado\n¿Hasta dónde llegar para conseguir una posición laboral? El estudio señala que recurrir a la mentira es un tema al que le restan importancia los candidatos, además de ser\nun fenómeno normal en la industria del capital humano y la contratación de nuevos perfiles.\n“Pero es un padecimiento que, aunque pareciera inofensivo, se ha convertido en una tendencia peligrosa para las organizaciones”, se lee en el reporte.\nDe hecho, el estudio refiere que en México uno de cada 5 candidatos miente en el CV; mientras que a nivel Latinoamérica son siete de cada 10 los que alteran su información en la hoja de vida, por lo que esta herramienta de contratación resulta cada día más inexacta e ineficaz.\nSin embargo, esto parece ser normal para los candidatos, el 16% de los postulantes a vacantes en México considera que está bien mentir sobre su pasado en términos de trabajo, aunque consideran que no tienen la intención de hacer nada deshonesto en el nuevo espacio laboral.\nPor género, son los hombres (65.6%) los\nmás propensos a mentir en su currículum que las mujeres (63.3%) de acuerdo con la medición 2024 de la Strategic Human Resourcing Management (SHRM).\nDe esta manera entre las 4 mentiras más recurrentes que encontró el estudio están:\n- Mentir en la formación académica o laboral\n- Inventar o exagerar conocimientos o experiencias en posiciones previas\n- Exagerar o mentir en la duración, cargo o actividades de empleo anterior\n- Grados o niveles de especialización.\nLa integridad dentro de la organización\nEl informe también aborda la ética e integridad desde el corazón de las organizaciones, ya que quienes ya están colaborando en las empresas también pueden presentar estas conductas inadecuadas.\nEl estudio de Midot señala que es importante considerar la evaluación periódica de los elementos actuales del equipo de trabajo.\nY es que los costos son bastante altos, Latinoamérica es la tercera región del mundo con los índices de corrupción y delitos corporativos más altos, sólo por debajo del este de Europa y el sur de Asia.\nAdemás, las empresas pierden hasta 40% de su productividad debido a los actos deshonestos de sus trabajadores. En América Latina sólo 30% de las empresas ha logrado recuperar todo lo perdido en un fraude.\nDirectivos de alto nivel, bajo la lupa\nEl estudio también indica que por rango jerárquico, son los propietarios, ejecutivos y managers los mayores responsables de cometer\nfraude en las empresas, las estadísticas muestran que dos de cada 10 directivos participan en actos poco éticos.\n“La integridad, o la falta de ella, puede influir directamente en la conducta y las decisiones de un empleado en todos los niveles jerárquicos, y los actos deshonestos representan un alto costo para la rentabilidad y el ambiente de las organizaciones”, señala el documento.\nEn México se tolera el comportamiento inadecuado, o poco ético, cuando está involucrado un director o cualquier otra persona con alta jerarquía, considera el 33% de los encuestados por Midot.\nLas industrias en donde se analizaron pruebas y se detectó malos comportamientos en México son: banca y finanzas, construcción, logística y transportes, comunicación y tecnologías de la información, y consultoría.\nLa evaluación periódica, así como la retroalimentación son dos elementos clave para que las organizaciones puedan prevenir acciones sin integridad que afecten su reputación y el negocio, finaliza el estudio.",

    "text": "For decades, David Goda felt an overwhelming sense of shame when he thought back on his wartime service in Vietnam. Not because of what he did \"over there,\" but because of what he didn't do.\nWhile serving two tours in a deeply unpopular war that claimed more than 58,000 American lives, Goda received a meritorious promotion to staff sergeant and several commendations and awards, including a Bronze Star.\nBut he keeps those decorations “in a box upstairs somewhere,” out of sight and mostly out of mind, because until recently he didn’t feel he’d earned them.\n\"I didn't fight. I didn't carry a weapon,\" said Goda, now 81. \"And they gave me some of the same awards they gave guys who got killed over there. It didn't feel right. Sometimes it still doesn't.\"\nBorn in Japan in 1942 — during World War II — to a Japanese father and American mother, Goda spent times in an orphanage while his parents shuttled between the U.S. and Japan to retain their American citizenship.\n“There was a law, in those days, that said if you were born abroad to an American parent, and you didn’t go back to the States by a certain age, you lost your citizenship,\" Goda said. \"So my older brother and sister had to go back to the States with my parents.\"\nGoda joined the Air Force in August 1962, at age 19. When he arrived at a base just outside Saigon in 1964, he was considering making the Air Force a career. His day-to-day duties mostly involved administrative support — or, as he put it, “sitting in an office most of the day.” But he’d always enjoyed photography, and when his unit needed an interim photographer, he volunteered for the job.\n“They knew I liked taking pictures,” he said. “So they gave me a camera and put me to work.”\nMuch of Goda’s photographic work was in support of battle assessments: pictures of damaged structures, confiscated weapons, prisoners and Vietnamese civilians. The job was seemingly benign enough — or it would have been, if he could have walked a different route to work.\nIn order to get from his barracks to his office, he had to walk past a building that had a peculiar, pungent odor. It didn’t take long for Goda to learn what the smell was, and what the building was being used for.\n“The smell was formaldehyde — the stuff they put into dead bodies to keep them preserved,” Goda said. “The building was a morgue.”\nMore than 50 years later, Goda can still remember the smell of the embalming chemicals, the blue body bags, and the trucks delivering wartime dead to a building he could not avoid.\n“We had to walk past it,” he said. “There was no other way.”\nGoda said he tried not to think about the building and the mortally wounded soldiers it housed. But at the end of his second tour, when he was awarded with the Bronze Star for meritorious service in a combat zone, he couldn’t help but think about the makeshift mortuary.\n“I really felt ashamed for the awards I got over there,\" Goda said, struggling to hold back tears. “I mostly just did office work and shooting pictures. And I would think about all those body bags I saw every day. All those people who died actually doing something.\n“What did they get? What did their families get? All those people who were killed, and I’m still walking around. Why did I deserve an award?”\nAccording to the Department of Defense, the Bronze Star medal is awarded to service members who “distinguished himself or herself by heroic of meritorious achievement or service” in a combat area. With two tours and several other decorations to his credit, Goda’s Vietnam service easily meets the criteria of meritorious service. But more than five decades after receiving the Bronze Star, the word \"heroic\" still chafes at his conscience.\n“I’m not a hero,” Goda said. “I’m not. I just did my job. Why should I get an award for that?”\nAfter Goda’s Vietnam experience, he had a “change of heart” about making the Air Force a career. He separated after eight years of service and took a job at Lockheed Martin, where he worked until 2006. During that time, he rarely looked at the awards he received for his service in southeast Asia.\n“I didn’t want to think about (the awards),” he said. “Too many bad memories.”\nAbout eight years ago, when Goda was working as a contractor in Afghanistan, he met a couple of senior active-duty soldiers. They began to form a bond, two modern-day troops and a veteran from a war that ended more than 40 years prior.\n“We would eat together and talk, about what troops are like today, and what it was like in my time,” he said.\nOne day, the conversation turned to awards and decorations. He told them about the Bronze Star and commendation medals in his box back home, and why he kept them there.\n“They told me, ‘You absolutely deserve them,’” Goda said. “’The soldiers who died over there were doing their jobs, and you were doing yours,’ they told me.”\n“They told me I should be proud of those medals. That I earned them.”\nThe conversation was a turning point for Goda. He’s willing to acknowledge that his contribution to the Vietnam war effort was valuable, even if he didn’t engage in combat.\n“When modern-day troops come home from overseas, it doesn’t matter (to civilians) if they fought in the field or sat in an office,” he said. “People thank them for their service. Well, I know I served my country, too.”\nGoda hasn’t progressed to the point of displaying his decorations at home, and he admits he may never get there. He doesn’t see himself as a war hero. His Bronze Star remains in a box.\nBut he now understands that his work in southeast Asia has earned him a place alongside the many U.S. soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who served before him, as well as those troops who serve today.\n“We’re all part of the (Armed Forces), whether we were in combat or not,” Goda said.",

    "title": "NEMO Aurora 2 Review: Affordable Tent Straddles Car Camping and Backpacking",
    "text": "Backpacking tents tend to be tighter on space to save on weight. But sometimes, some extra headspace makes it a lot easier to change clothes, play games, or generally live more comfortably. I am only 5’3″, so I find most tents spacious enough. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is 6’2″ and always appreciates a little extra space. Sometimes, it’s worth the extra weight. The NEMO Aurora 2 tent is listed on NEMO’s website as a backpacking tent, though it verges on a car camping tent. In terms of weight and bulk, it’s right on the line.\nMy boyfriend and I spent last fall using it in Hawaii and Indiana together. We have used it for the whole summer, road-tripping throughout Michigan. This fall, we’ll continue to use it in Indiana in various state parks. We’ve slept in wind, rain, and under oak trees, dropping acorns like hail.\nIf you prioritize spaciousness, it’s worth the weight penalty on the backpacking trail — especially if you can split it up between two people. As someone who often backpacks and camps by car, having a tent that can double for both is ideal.\nIn short: The NEMO Aurora 2 tent ($300) is a great tent for one or two people who love to camp and backpack and want plenty of room for extra comfort. It has massive doors, vestibules, and vertical walls that make it very spacious. It uses a PFAS-free and FR-chemical-free waterproof rainfly. A nearly all-mesh body provides excellent air circulation and ventilation. There are plenty of pockets for organization and storage, and the footprint is even included. If you’re looking for comfort, durability, and versatility within a budget, the NEMO Aurora 2 tent is a fantastic choice.\nIf you’re shopping for backpacking tents, compare the NEMO Aurora 2 to the others in our guide to the Best Backpacking Tents .\nNEMO Aurora 2 Tent check price at rei check price at nemo equipment Specs 2-Person: 3-Season: Minimum weight: 4 lbs., 11 oz. Packed weight: 5 lbs., 10 oz. Peak height: 44\" / 111.76 cm Floor area: 32.4 sq. ft./ 3.0 sq. m Floor dimensions: 88\" x 53\" / 223.52 x 135.62 cm Vestibule: 9.2 sq. ft .+ 9.2 sq. ft. / 0.9 sq. m + 0.9 sq. m Door and vestibule quantity: 2 Canopy fabric: 68 D polyester / no-see-um mesh Rainfly fabric: PU polyester (2,000 mm) Floor fabric: 75 PU recycled polyester (2,000 mm) Pros Very spacious Durable (a great long-term option) Footprint included Easy set-up Cons Heavier than most backpacking tents Xiaoling Keller NEMO Aurora 2 Tent Review This tent has been used for one full fall season and one full summer season. This fall, we’re entering its third season of use. We also purchased the NEMO Roamer 2 sleeping pad , the NEMO Jazz double sleeping bag , and the NEMO Fillo King pillows to build out a full camping/sleeping kit for two.\nThis intent has seen a lot of camping over the last year, and it’s lived up to NEMO’s reputation for high-quality camping gear. We’ve been very pleased with it and the rest of our NEMO setup. However, even among the tents NEMO sells for backpacking, this one is on the bulkier and heavier side. We also have a NEMO Dagger tent that’s lighter and, in my opinion, better for backpacking.\nWhere the Aurora 2 has an edge over some of NEMO’s lighter backpacking tents is in its price. This tent is only $300, making it an affordable choice for a two-person backpacking tent. The NEMO Aurora 2 backpacking tent also comes in a three-person size, and there are two color options: Frost/Silt and Mango/Fog.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) Aurora 2 Set-Up Assembling this tent is straightforward and intuitive. It gets even faster when you do it often and become efficient.\nThe main pole is symmetrical, so you can easily attach it to whatever side you’re on. It is made of lightweight aluminum poles with a custom-forged hub. The grommets where it attaches are also metal and so far seem very durable.\nA smaller pole curves across the top holding out the mesh with tension and extending the sidewalls out. That’s where all the extra headroom comes from.\nAdditionally, once the rainfly is on, the tent stakes out wide offering large vestibules with lots of storage space. NEMO includes guy-out lines with the stakes for the rainfly.\nEasy setup and wide curved zipper; (photo/Xiaoling Keller)\nZippers & Pockets One of the standout features of this tent is the long, curved, continuous zipper of the door. I’ve used a continuous zipper before. But the curve wasn’t quite large enough, so it would get stuck, and it eventually broke.\nThis tent doesn’t seem to have that problem. The curve is long enough that the zipper smoothly glides in the grooves for easy in-and-out access.\nOnce you’re inside the tent, you’ll notice and appreciate the number of pockets. There are two long pockets on the ends, two deep pockets on the sides, and one “Nitelight” pocket for a headlamp up above that diffuses light. It makes it easy to organize your accessories and light the tent up when its dark out. It also has loops for a mini lantern or a string of lights.\nThe Aurora 2 is at home car camping and just light enough for backpacking; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) Materials & Colors The fabric is made of 68D polyester, which is ideal for keeping bugs out while allowing for plenty of airflow. Most of the tent body is mesh, so if both doors are looped back or the rainfly is off altogether, condensation is minimal and almost nonexistent. NEMO includes toggles so you can roll the rainfly or doors back and secure them in place.\nThe rainfly is made of PU polyester. Whether its waterproofing fails with age remains to be seen. We’ve only used this tent for 1 year. But from all of our use, it has maintained its waterproofing and kept us dry. When it gets water on it, the sun dries it out fairly quickly.\nSpacious interior and ample pockets make the NEMO Aurora 2 perfect for comfortable, organized camping; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) Weather Resistance We recently weathered a storm in this tent, and we’ll weather more as we get deeper into fall. It was pouring and extremely windy. Eventually, it stopped, and the wind blew all the water off our rainfly. But it wasn’t long before it started pouring again.\nThe inside of the tent stayed completely dry without any signs of leaking or letting moisture bleed through. The 2,000mm waterproof rating of the rainfly did its job.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) When we left, I had to pack the tent away wet. But the following morning, I just tied it to a pole and let it blow in the wind for about 20 minutes to dry it out sufficiently.\nSome online reviews have commented that the Aurora 2 doesn’t perform very well in high wind conditions. But in my experience, I found it to be sturdy and stable.\nRoom for Improvement My only gripe with this tent is its weight and bulk. It is marketed as a backpacking tent, but even on NEMO’s webpage for the Aurora 2, it recommends removing the poles “to share the weight with a friend.” This isn’t to say that this is a monstrously heavy tent. At 4 pounds, 11 ounces, there is one tent on our Guide to the Best Backpacking Tents that outweighs the Aurora 2. And among the Best Camping Tents , this would be the lightest by far.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) It’s also fairly bulky for a backpacking tent, which many people mention in their reviews and which I experienced as well. It isn’t the slimmest backpacking tent out there. But again, the tradeoff is the level of comfort and room it offers inside.\nFor those who want something lighter, we love our NEMO OSMO Dagger 2 — but it comes at a much steeper price ($529).\nConclusion: Who Is It For? Tested across multiple seasons, the NEMO Aurora 2 has proven spacious, durable, and well-suited for regular camping trips; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) The NEMO Aurora 2 is an ideal tent for two people who love to camp often and want plenty of room for extra comfort. I’ve used other tents and I camp very frequently, and I’d highly recommend the NEMO Aurora 2 tent for its design and affordability. At $300, it would be the fourth cheapest option on both our guides to the Best Backpacking Tents and the Best Camping Tents .\nWhile I prefer the NEMO OSMO Dagger for backpacking, I find this tent perfect for car camping and as a backup for backpacking if needed. For people who want one tent that will work well for both, the Aurora 2 lands squarely in the crossover space.\nYou’ll be happy using it in either setting — especially if you have an extra person to split its weight and bulk with when you’re backpacking trail.\nThe NEMO Aurora 2 also comes with its own footprint. Tent footprints are usually sold separately, so that’s a nice extra touch that extends the life of the tent. For its price, this is a solid investment that doesn’t break the bank and will last for years.\nAn Ultralight Tent Without the Ultralight Tradeoffs: NEMO Hornet OSMO 3P Tent Review The semi-freestanding NEMO Hornet OSMO is very light, but it doesn’t sacrifice livability, storm protection, or the little details.
