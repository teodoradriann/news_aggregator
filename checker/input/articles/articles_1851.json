    "text": "Today, we stand together, hearts heavy yet hopeful, to pay tribute to an extraordinary man—former President Muhammadu Buhari—who left us on July 13, 2025, at 82. His passing marks the end of a life that was anything but ordinary. A life that began in the quiet village of Daura and rose to shape the soul of our nation. Today, we don’t just mourn a leader; we honour a beacon of resilience, integrity, and unwavering love for Nigeria.\n And as we pay tribute to Muhammadu Buhari, let his story inspire us to rise above our challenges and build the Nigeria he dreamed of. This is our tribute to you, Baba Buhari showed us that greatness isn’t about where you start—it’s about where you’re determined to go. When you stepped into Aso Rock in 2015, Nigeria was on its knees—Boko Haram’s terror, corruption’s grip, and an economy teetering on the edge. You didn’t shy away. You promised “Change,” and you fought for it with every ounce of your being.\nFurthermore, you recovered millions in stolen funds, launched N-Power to empower our youth, and gave millions of families hope through the Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Were there setbacks? Yes. Did every plan work perfectly? No. But your heart was always with Nigeria, and for that, we salute you. Your life wasn’t just about policy, it was about principle. You lived modestly, even as president. You faced illness with courage, laughing off wild rumours of a body double with that quiet humour we came to love, saying, “It’s the real me, I assure you.” You showed us that vulnerability and strength could coexist. And when you left office, you returned to Daura, not to a mansion but to a life of simplicity, claiming you struggled financially like so many Nigerians. That honesty, that humanity, is why we honour you today. Ba ba Buhari, we say: Thank you for being uncommon. Thank you for showing us that integrity matters, that discipline can rebuild, and that a single heart can carry a nation’s hopes.\nSPONSOR AD Now, my fellow Nigerian and well-wishers, this tribute isn’t just words—it’s a call to action. Buhari’s life challenges us to rise above our struggles. Maybe you’re facing hardship today, money’s tight, dreams feel distant, or the weight of life feels too heavy. Let Buhari’s story remind you: you are stronger than your challenges. He didn’t let the loss stop him.\nAs we say farewell, we pray for you, Baba. May your soul rest in Aljannatul Firdaus. May your vision for a united, disciplined Nigeria live on in us.\nSaidu Bn Malik wrote via [email protected] .\nSponsored News Update: Nigerians have now been approved to get paid in US Dollars, acquire Ultra-premium domains for as low as $1700 and profit $15,000 (₦24Million naira).

    "title": "Nirmal Srinivasan, MPS ‘23, on the advice that helped him land a job in data science",
    "text": "December 5, 2024\nBy Louis DiPietro\nResilience is a requirement in the job market. Nirmal Srinivasan, MPS ’23, would add adaptability, too.\n“I would keep applying for a lot of jobs and get all these rejections. I’m thinking, ‘What am I doing wrong?’” Srinivasan said of his time as a Cornell graduate student in the Master of Professional Studies in data science and applied statistics. “This classmate used to joke with us, saying, ‘You guys actually don't need to apply for jobs; you just need to keep talking to people.’ That thought stayed in my head. At the start of my second semester, I reframed my objectives.”\nGranted, Srinivasan still applied for jobs, but he made networking a priority in the latter half of his MPS experience. He had the skills. Afterall, the education he received in Cornell’s one-year MPS program in data science and applied statistics was, and continues to be, highly coveted across industries. He just needed to find the right job, and networking provided a roadmap, he said.\n“If you’re looking for jobs, that’s the roadmap: talk to as many people as you can,” he said.\nToday, Srinivasan is a senior data professional at Lumen Technologies, a telecommunications company. At Lumen, where he has worked since July 2023, he describes his role as a mix of both data analyst and data scientist – someone who generates meaningful insights from data and comes up with recommendations for company leadership.\n“A lot of my MPS classes helped me in my current job, especially starting right out,” he said.\nFor example, he spent his early days at Lumen working on prediction models – the foundations of which he learned in two courses from his MPS experience, Data Mining and Machine Learning (STSCI 5740) and Applied Time Series Analysis (STSCI 5550).\nHis path to Cornell and the MPS program came after dabbling in machine learning and computer vision research as an undergraduate engineering major in India.\n“When you look beneath the machine learning and deep learning, it’s all math and statistics,” he said. “That was my starting point in switching from engineering to data science.”\nSrinivasan cites three factors that lured him from across the planet to Ithaca, and to Cornell’s MPS in data science and applied statistics program: the Big Red’s Ivy League renown and brand value on a résumé, a strong alumni network, and a rigorous, relevant curriculum with direct application to jobs in industry. All three factors proved valid, particularly the rigor of the MPS curriculum. It wasn’t easy, he said.\n“I didn’t realize that statistics could get this deep.”\nBut he sought out professors during office hours and stayed on top of his coursework, all while juggling part-time statistics jobs within Cornell Athletics and the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science’s Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging, to name a couple.\nOnce he changed up his priorities in the job hunt, Srinivasan got on LinkedIn and began reaching out to Cornell alumni. The goal wasn’t to get referrals, he said. It was to learn about industries, what companies need, and to discover where his MPS skills could be used.\nThrough CUeLINKS, he met a Cornell alumnus who was a recently retired hiring manager willing to review his résumé.\n“After two days he gave me a call that went for two hours. He said, ‘Look, I’m going to go through your résumé section by section, and I’m going to tell you exactly where you’re going wrong,’” Srinivasan said. “People like him are the reason I chose Cornell. You just can’t imagine how willing some alumni are to help you.”\nSrinivasan emphasizes that the Cornell alumni network has helped him at each step of his professional career, even before he arrived on campus in the Fall of 2022 for his first semester in the MPS program. He leaned on the Big Red alumni network when deciding to apply to the MPS program. As a graduate student, he connected with alumni to inform decisions around course selection and to network during the job hunt. Even today, he turns to them if he hits a technical snag in his current job.\n“It made sense to me, as a student, to learn from these alumni,” Srinivasan said. “And even today, I can always reach back out to them.”\nTo new and prospective students, Srinivasan urges them to lean on critical program support staff within the Department of Statistics and Data Science, like Anita Scheible, career services advisor, and Allen Ward, graduate field coordinator, who helped him find part-time jobs on campus and prepare for job interviews.\nAs to his other piece of advice, there is no surprise.\n“I would say talking to people has an even greater value in finding a job than sending off résumés for a job post,” he said. “Through networking and meeting people, you also begin to better understand industries and businesses, which will give you a head start over the rest of the crowd. That knowledge is very underrated.”\nNew and current MPS students with questions about networking or other aspects of the MPS program are encouraged to get in touch with Nirmal via LinkedIn.\nLouis DiPietro is a writer for the Cornell Ann S.

    "text": "BREWSTER, N.Y. -- The Enoch Crosby Chapter of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution celebrated the holiday season with a luncheon, complete with a gift drive and a Yankee Swap at the Brewster VFW, along with its regular meeting. More than two dozen gifts were wrapped and donated to two Carmel families in need. Members were enthusiastic about supporting the community in this way and brightening the holidays for children who otherwise would not receive gifts due to difficult circumstances. In addition, chapter members participated in an annual gift card collection to support the Putnam/Northern Westchester Women’s Resource Center. Three new members were inducted: Meghan Reilly, Betty Spano, and Donna O’Creene Kern. Meghan Reilly and her sister Morgan are descendants of Solomon Hopkins, who served in the 7th Regiment of the Dutchess County Militia. A historic marker on Route 301 states that he would leave an upstairs window unlocked for his brother-in-law, Patriot Spy Enoch Crosby to come and go as needed. Betty Spano has found many familiar local names in her family tree including Adams, Tompkins, Smalley, Barrett, and Bennett through research over the last few years. Dawn O’Creene Kern, a newlywed, and new to genealogy research as well, appreciated the assistance of Libby Baker, Chapter Registrar. Holly O’Connor, membership chair and corresponding secretary, and Adrienne Davies, chapter chaplain, conducted the induction ceremony, introduced the new members and presented them with gifts and information to encourage their future participation. The chapter also honored Alexandra Johnson for her 60 years of membership. Her friendship is cherished and her service is greatly appreciated. Mrs. Johnson was inducted at the age of 18 in Brewster, with her mother, Mabel Holmes Addis and her aunt Marjorie Lobdell Addis, in attendance. Her grandmother, Esther Lobdell Addis was a founding member of the Enoch Crosby Chapter. Mrs. Johnson states that she enjoys the congenial camaraderie of the chapter and is continuing to research supplemental ancestors who participated in the American Revolution. Meetings in 2024 will be held on the second Saturday of each month at various locations around Putnam County, starting in February. Any woman 18 years or older, regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background, who can prove lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution is eligible to join. For more information or assistance with membership, please contact Regent Joan Hay at jehjbh@hotmail.com or Registrar Libby Baker at libbybaker@aol.com .

    "text": "En Cisjordanie, l'isolement numérique pèse sur la population\nLe réseau satellitaire Starlink, propriété d’Elon Musk, a commencé à opérer en Israël. Il permet un accès toujours plus rapide à internet et aux télécommunications. Mais le milliardaire américain a décidé que son service n’assurerait pas la couverture réseau pour les territoires palestiniens. Une façon d’isoler un peu plus la population qui vit sous occupation israélienne, alors qu’en Cisjordanie par exemple, les Palestiniens n’ont accès qu’à une réseau 3G bien plus faible et capricieux qu’en Israël.\nPublié le :\nAvec notre correspondante à Ramallah, Alice Moreno\nSi le centre-ville de Ramallah dispose d’une bonne couverture réseau, c’est beaucoup moins le cas dans les quartiers périphériques. Tarek agite son téléphone, visiblement agacé : « Le service, les communications en général, sont très faibles. Soit l’électricité est coupée à cause de l’occupation, soit les opérateurs ne diffusent pas, ce qui rend la connexion internet et les communications très lentes et pénibles. Autrement dit, si nous sortons de Ramallah, internet et les appels sont parfois inexistants. »\n« Nous n’avons que la 3G »\nDepuis les accords d’Oslo, conclus dans les années 90, c’est Israël qui a la main sur les ondes et fréquences en Cisjordanie, rappelle un jeune étudiant en ingénierie informatique : « Nous n’avons aucun contrôle sur le réseau ici. La décision ne nous revient pas, nous n’avons que la 3G, alors que partout dans le monde, actuellement il y a la 4G. Mais ici elle est interdite jusqu’à présent, parce que les autorités israéliennes ne veulent pas en entendre parler. Tandis qu’eux ont la 5G ! »\nDécision injuste\nIl n’est pas étonné une seule seconde par la décision d’Elon Musk de priver les Palestiniens du service satellitaire Starlink : « Sa décision est attendue, car il considère que n’importe quel bénéfice, n’importe quel progrès pour le peuple palestinien peut représenter un danger pour les Israéliens. »\nS’il n’est pas surpris, il dénonce toutefois une décision injuste qui isole toujours un peu plus les Palestiniens du reste du monde.\nÀ lire aussiCisjordanie occupée: à Itamar, des colons favorables au plan israélien pour Gaza\nNewsletterRecevez toute l'actualité internationale directement dans votre boite mail\nJe m'abonne",
