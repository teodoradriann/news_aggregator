    "title": "’Escote de la muerte’: el complejo fenómeno meteorológico que estaría afectando Chile",
    "text": "Escote de la Muerte La lluvia regresó con gran intensidad a las zonas sur y centro sur de Chile, luego de un mes de julio más bien seco. El sistema frontal ha dejado graves consecuencias en las regiones de Araucanía y Biobío, mientras se desplaza hasta la Metropolitana. Lo cierto es que algunos meteorólogos, desde antes, pronosticaron el paso de un fenómeno meteorológico conocido como ‘Escote del diablo’, o ‘Escote de la muerte’, el cual básicamente se daría en Santiago. La situación fue explicada por el meteorólogo Eduardo Sáez a La Tercera, quien sostuvo que básicamente se trata de lluvias más débiles para la capital, en comparación a lo que puede pasar en Valparaíso y la precordillera. “Se forma una configuración donde baja la concentración de precipitaciones en valles respecto a la cordillera y costa”, indicó. “El ‘escote de la muerte’ se percibe como una letra V en el mapa, porque, a raíz de los vientos, hace que el sistema frontal tome esta forma y haya una zona ‘libre’ (en este caso, la región Metropolitana) que tenga una lluvia más débil, en comparación al resto”, agregó. Por lo pronto, el profesional asegura que no se trata de un término que avizore una catástrofe, sino que más bien es parte de la jerga en aquel rubro. Expresión similar tuvo Gianfranco Marcone en Canal 13, al explicar lo que podría venir para el Gran Santiago en cuanto a lluvias. “Cuando teníamos un sistema frontal, la última parte llegaba a la zona central, esta última parte generalmente es la más débil”. “Entonces uno decía, está lloviendo en Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, en San José de Maipo, Buin, ¿Por qué no llueve en Santiago?”, concluyó. No obstante, Sáez adelanta que sí o sí existirán lluvias en el centro del país: #si uno lo mira desde la cantidad de lluvia, en Santiago no lloverá lo mismo que se espera en Valparaíso. Pero de que va a llover, va a llover igual”.",

    "text": "After an Oztag touch footy player tearfully apologised for his\n“stupid” assault on a referee that caused a brain bleed, the one-punch attack victim stepped forward to shake hands.\nBenson Leipau Pauga had approached Jason Fernie in the July 2022 game’s second half after his team accused the referee of favouring the opposition, a\nBrisbane court was told on Thursday.\nAfter a verbal exchange, Pauga punched the 49-year-old Fernie on the jaw.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app:\nDownload today\nFernie fell backwards, hitting his head on the ground and convulsed, with blood on his mouth.\nPauga, now 34, left the sports ground while Fernie, a referee for 22 years, was taken to hospital with a brain bleed and concussion.\nOn the judge’s instructions, Pauga turned in the Brisbane District Court dock to face Fernie, before tearfully reading a letter of apology.\n“What I did was wrong. I really made a stupid mistake,” he said.\n“I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me.”\nAs Pauga finished, Fernie stood up and shook his hand.\nIt was clear from Fernie’s victim impact statement the assault had a significant emotional and physical impact on the referee and his family, Judge Paul Smith said.\nThe court was told Pauga described his conduct as a “blind explosion” during a week in which he separated from his wife and his scaffolding business partner had left.\n“Referees need to feel safe from players but there was only one punch,” Smith said.\nTaking into account Pauga’s guilty plea to one count of assault occasioning bodily harm, Smith sentenced him to a 12-month intensive corrections order and recorded a conviction.\nPauga, who was raised in West Auckland and moved to Australia in 2009, risked being deported if he was sentenced to actual time in custody.\nHe was ordered to pay $5000 compensation to Fernie within six months.\nThe court heard he has a lifetime ban from playing Oztag.\nOutside court, Fernie said it was good that Pauga apologised but his actions were totally unacceptable.\nDescribing the legal system as pretty soft and the compensation amount “a joke”, Fernie said the outcome was disappointing and he still suffered after the assault.\n“I can’t ref anymore, that’s what hurts the most. I miss my Oztag family,” he said.\nAustralian Oztag general manager Luke Manahan said the organisation takes a strong stance towards abuse against referees and officials.\n“We know how important referees are for our game,” he told AAP.\nOztag is a non-tackling version of rugby league.\nStream free on",

(WWSB) - Mostly cloudy skies turn into partly cloudy skies by the morning. The overnight low temperature will hit 51 degrees. As the day progresses more sunshine appears, leading to an overall sunnier weekend. It will feel drier and less humid as dewpoints dip to the 40s. For beachgoers and boaters, a rip current statement remains in effect for the entire coast of Manatee and Sarasota county through 9 p.m., Saturday evening. Winds will come from the northwest Saturday, with gusts near 20 mph. Seas improve slightly from Friday, reaching two to four feet, and possibly five feet. Bay and inland waters will have a moderate chop to choppy conditions. Winds die down Saturday evening and conditions significantly improve for boaters Sunday and New Year’s Day. A jacket may be required to stay warm New Year’s Eve. When the pineapple drops in downtown Sarasota at midnight, the temperature will be in the low 50s.

    "text": "Victor Wembanyama’s Season Cut Short by Injury: What It Means\nVictor Wembanyama's promising season has come to an abrupt end due to a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. This condition, which echoes the struggles faced by former player Chris Bosh, raises concerns for Wembanyama's future. Despite uncertainty, sources report that the Spurs are optimistic about his recovery, hoping to see him return at full strength by the next season. Wembanyama's impressive stats highlight his impact, averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and leading the league with 3.8 blocks per game.\n- 24.3 points per game, 11 rebounds, 3.8 blocks (leading the league)\n- Only five players in NBA history averaged 20-10-3-3-1 for a full season; Wembanyama has done this in each of his first two seasons.\n- Rejects 10.1% of opponents' 2-point shots, the fifth-highest block rate in NBA history.\nWhile Wembanyama's current diagnosis is concerning, comparisons to Chris Bosh's career-threatening issues highlight the potential severity of the situation. However, initial reports suggest this may be an isolated incident rather than the beginning of a recurring health issue.\nState of Play- Wembanyama played only 46 games this season, falling short of the 65-game eligibility for year-end awards.\n- The Spurs' playoff hopes diminish significantly without their star player, as they face a tough road ahead.\nThe Spurs expect Wembanyama to make a full recovery by September, allowing them to focus on building around his talent alongside newly acquired De’Aaron Fox. This situation may also push the team to secure a higher draft pick for future improvements.\nBottom LineWembanyama's season-ending diagnosis is a significant blow for the Spurs, but there is cautious optimism about his recovery. The team's focus should be on his health, as safeguarding their generational talent is crucial for long-term success.\nRead more at Yahoo Sports\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
