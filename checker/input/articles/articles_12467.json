    "title": "Hungarian PM Viktor Orban Says Trump’s Return Would Be Better For The World",
    "text": "Donald Trump will stop the conflict between Russia and Ukraine if he wins the election and returns to the White House, according to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Orban made the comment on Saturday in a video message on his Facebook page dedicated to his meeting with the 45th US president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida the previous day.

Stressing that there was no conflict in Ukraine or the Middle East at that time, Orban added: Today, there would’ve been no war if he was (still) the US president“ [RT ](https://www.rt.com/news/593997-trump-orban-biden-us/)reports: According to Orban, Trump and him agreed that “there will be peace if there will be world leaders who want peace.” The Hungarian PM added that he was “proud” that his country was one of those that are striving for peace. Since the start of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022, Hungary has been consistently calling for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Unlike its EU neighbors, Budapest has refused to provide weapons to Kiev, maintained economic ties with Moscow and criticized the bloc’s sanctions against Russia as “counterproductive.” Russia has repeatedly said that it is ready for dialogue, but stressed that it hasn’t been getting any reasonable proposals that would account for the actual situation on the ground from Kiev or its backers in the US and the EU. According to Moscow, in such conditions it has no other choice but to keep pursuing its goals in Ukraine via military means. Orban explained that the aim of his visit to Florida was “to say frankly” that Trump’s second presidency “will be better for the whole world,” not just for ties between Budapest and Washington. The Hungarian PM added that it would, of course, be up to the American people to decide who will be their next head of state. Earlier this week, Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in the election as his last renaming rival, Nikki Haley, suspended her campaign after losing primaries in 14 out of 15 states. US President Joe Biden lashed out at both Trump and Orban during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday. “You know who he [Trump] is meeting with today down in Mar-a-Lago? Orban of Hungary, who’s stated flatly that he doesn’t think democracy works, he’s looking for dictatorship.” Biden claimed that he himself was looking for a future “where we defend democracy, not diminish it.” During his campaign, Trump has repeatedly vowed to settle the Ukraine conflict “within 24 hours” if he returns to the Oval Office, claiming he would sit down with both Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

    "text": "DPD K-9 officer Dawn retires after 7 years of service Leaving a pawprint of achievements and community impact DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - After seven and a half years of service, a standout member of the Davenport Police force is retiring. The Davenport Police Department announced that one of their K-9 officers is retiring. K-9 Dawn joined the Davenport police force in August 2016 to work alongside her handler Sergeant Brandon Koepke. Dawn wasn’t always a police dog; she was a family pet in West Virginia, but her high energy led her to the pound where she faced an uncertain fate. “She was three days away from getting put to sleep when a worker at the Humane Society there contacted local canine trainers and said we got this dog here that has a very high drive,” said Sergeant Koepke. She was then sent to North Iowa K-9 where she trained to become a police dog. “It’s a kind of strenuous process to make a dog into a police dog. But basically, if a dog has a ball drive, then you can teach them how to do whatever you want. So, she has an insane ball drive; she’ll go after a ball, and she won’t ever stop,” said Sergeant Koepke. K-9 Dawn is a single-purpose Black Labrador trained in narcotics detection and tracking, and article recovery. “She spent four and a half years in the narcotics unit, then also three years on patrol. She’s done a lot of work for us here at Davenport PD; she’s been solely responsible for a lot of state and federal arrests, a lot of gun seizures, millions of dollars in narcotic seizures, and numerous search warrants, and money seizures,” said Sergeant Koepke. Sgt. Koepke says Dawn was always a very social dog. “She shows up to all the parties at the parks and cops and Coco and everything else where we get to meet a lot of kids. They love on her. She’s a perfect dog for that; she’s got a great demeanor for helping out with the community. I would say community engagement is probably the best part of having her, my best memories.” The Police department celebrated Dawn’s retirement with a farewell party and a cake. “She will be literally sitting at home and giving the mailman a piece of her mind once a day, but hopefully, just relaxing and enjoying retirement just like anybody else would,” said Sgt. Koepke. The Davenport Police Department is waiting for the arrival of a new K-9 from Slovakia. The new K-9 is a German Shepherd mix and will be assigned to the patrol division.” Copyright 2023 KWQC.

    "text": "Criticising Himanta Sarma-led Assam government's action to repeal the Muslim marriages Act, Samajwadi Party MP asserted, ‘Muslims will follow only Shariat and Quran.’Speaking to news agency ANI, ST Hassan said, \\\"There is no need to highlight this so much. Muslims will follow Shariat and Quran. They (the government) may draft as many Acts as they want...Every religion has its own rituals. They are being followed for thousands of years now. They will continue to be followed.\\\"Assam's move to repeal Muslim Marriage Act and how it was criticised:After a late-night meeting on Friday, Assam Cabinet decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1935. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the action was taken to to end child marriage in the state.\\\"This Act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21 respectively, as required by law. This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam,\\\" the Chief Minister posted on X.As per the order, the district commissioners and district registrars will be authorised to take \\\"custody of registration records\\\" currently with 94 Muslim Marriage Registrars on repeal of the legislation under overall supervision and control of the Assam Inspector General of Registration.“A one-time compensation of ₹two lakh will be provided to Muslim Marriage Registrars for their rehabilitation after the Act is repealed.”Meanwhile, the move received backlash from Congress, Samajwadi Party, All India United Democratic Front and othersCalling it a ‘discriminatory decision’, Congress leader Abdur Rashid Mandal said since Assam government failed to ban polygamy for unknown reasons, they brought this rule.\\\"Just before the election, they're trying to polarise the Hindu voters in favour of BJP by depriving and discriminating Muslims in some fields like repealing this act saying that this is a pre-independence act and citing child marriage which is not a fact. This is the only mechanism to register the marriages of Muslims and there is no other scope or institution and it is also as per the constitution of India. It is the personal law of the Muslim that can't be repealed... I'll discuss it with the leaders of my party and my party will speak about it,\\\" he said.Meanwhile, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) leader Rafiqul Islam called it a \\\"tactic to target Muslims.\\\"Rafiqul, while speaking to ANI, \\\"This Government doesn't have the courage to bring UCC. They can't do it. What they brought in Uttarakhand, is not UCC either...They were trying to bring UCC to Assam too. But I think they can't bring it to Assam because there are people from several castes and communities here...BJP followers themselves follow those practices here...Elections are approaching, this is just their tactics to target Muslims,\\\" he said.\\\"They couldn't bring any Bill on polygamy or UCC in Assam...So, they are repealing the Assam Muslim Marriages & Divorces Registration Act. Assam cabinet doesn't have the right to repeal or amend a constitutional right...\\\" the AIUDF MLA further said.(With agency inputs)",
