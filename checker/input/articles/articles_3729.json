    "text": "Detroit Mountain overcomes challenges to stay open during unseasonably warm weather DETROIT LAKES, MINN. (Valley News Live) - Businesses that specialize in winter recreation are facing challenges because of the lack of snow and unseasonably warm temperatures. However, Detroit Mountain in Detroit Lakes, Minn., is still offering what they can to those who are looking for ways to enjoy the great outdoors this season. “I like to ski on the little hill,” says 7-year-old, Claire Leonard of Fergus Falls. 10-year-old, Whitten Sturdevant from Minnetonka says, “I love most about skiing is when you get to feel the cold air when you’re going down the hill.” These two skiers say they love to spend time with their family on the slopes, but neither have had much of a chance to enjoy their favorite winter activity because of the warm weather. “I have to admit an extra month of what seems like fall hasn’t been the worst thing in the world, but I know for skiers and snowmobilers and for snowboarders they’re really looking for some of that white stuff,” says Claire’s dad, Nick Leonard. In fact, this year is on pace to be one of the warmest [Decembers](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/balmy-and-snowless-december-2023.html) in Minnesota’s history. “The biggest challenge without question has just been the warm temps, I mean warm weather and rain it just makes for a tough combination for making snow,” explains Tom Thiel. He’s in his first year in the role of general manager at Detroit Mountain Recreation Area. He says they’ve only been open for nine days out of the month of December when typically, they’d be open for 20. He says, “Normally, by this time of year, this side of tubing would be completely covered with snow and as you can see we’re a cover is a bit thin, we do have our snow gun set up and we’ll be making more snow over here in the next few days as temps drop.” According to the National Weather Service, Detroit Lakes has only had 4.5 inches of snow total, much of which has melted due to warm temps and rain. However, people are still coming out to Detroit Mountain. Thiel adds, “Having people here smiling enjoying these winter conditions is great.” Detroit Mountain is relying on their 22 snow machines to stay open for business, but there’s another snag- temperatures have to below mid-20s for the snow machines to be effective! However, there’s still plenty of winter left and they’re hoping for more of the real stuff. You can find ticket prices and hours for Detroit Mountain [here](https://detroitmountain.com/).

    "text": "TEHRAN — Thousands massed on Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike.\nThe crowd in Tehran's central Imam Hossein square chanted \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America\".\nIsrael has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi's killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Hamas-Israel conflict since early October.\nIranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday killed Moussavi, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arms, the Quds Force, near the Syrian capital Damascus.\nThe Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier on Thursday met with Moussavi's family and led a prayer over the slain general's body before it was taken to the square.\nMany of the mourners were waving yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent”, a reference to Israel.\nThe head of the Guards, Hossein Salami, hailed Moussavi as “one of the most experienced and effective IRGC commanders in the Axis of Resistance”, Tehran-aligned armed groups in the Middle East.\nSalami praised Moussavi for his key role after a former Quds Force commander, the revered Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Soleimani had run the Guards’ foreign operations for more than a decade.\nIRGC spokesman Ramezan Sharif warned on Wednesday that “our response to Moussavi’s assassination will be a combination of direct action as well as [from]others led by the Axis of Resistance”.\nSharif charged that Israel’s killing of the general “was likely due to its failures” when Palestinian Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on October 7.",

    "text": "With a leap day happening just once every four years, there’s must less of a chance for a historic event to take place on February 29. However, February 29, 1968, turned out to be an important date in the annals in [Beatles](https://americansongwriter.com/tag/the-beatles/) history. That’s the day that the Fab Four’s landmark album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, took home four fab awards at the [10th annual Grammys ceremony](https://www.grammy.com/awards/10th-annual-grammy-awards). Videos by American Songwriter No other Beatles album has ever been honored with four Grammy Awards in one year. [[RELATED: How Dolly Parton reunited The Beatles’ Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for Rockstar]](https://americansongwriter.com/how-dolly-parton-reunited-the-beatles-paul-mccartney-and-ringo-starr-for-rockstar/) Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band won in the Album of the Year and Best Contemporary Album categories, and also nabbed trophies in the Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical and Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts categories. Longtime Beatles engineer received the Best Engineered Recording Grammy, while cover-art designers Peter Blake and Jann Haworth took home the Best Album Cover prize. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band winning the Album of the Year Grammy was particularly significant, because no rock album had ever received the honor before. The Beatles Also Received Other Nominations in 1968 Meanwhile, The Beatles also were nominated for Best Performance by a Vocal Group and Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental) honors for the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album. However, they lost in both categories to The Fifth Dimension’s hit song “Up, Up and Away.” In addition, the Sgt. Pepper’s track “A Day in the Life” was up for the wordily named Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)/Best Background Arrangement honor, but that Grammy went to Bobbie Gentry’s “Ode to Billie Joe” and that tunes arranger, Jimmie Haskell. The Beatles Didn’t Attend the 1968 Grammys The 1968 Grammy Awards were presented in four different cities—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Nashville. The Beatles were not in attendance at any of the locations, since the band members were all on their spiritual retreat with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India. The Band’s Other Grammy Wins The Beatles won their first two Grammys in 1965, taking home the Best New Artist award and the Best Performance by a Vocal Group honor for “A Hard Day’s Night.” Then, in 1967, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were honored as composers in the Song of the Year category for the band’s “Michelle.” In 1971, The Beatles four members—Lennon, McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—were presented with Grammy for the Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special for Let It Be. The band wouldn’t win another Grammy until 1997, when it took home three trophies. The Beatles Anthology won the Best Music Video, Long Form honor, while the single “Free as a Bird” was honored with the Best Music Video, Short Form and the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. The Fab Four scored two more Grammy wins in 2008, when the Love remix album nabbed the Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Surround Sound Album prizes. 2011 saw the band’s The Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings) box set win Best Historical Album. The Fab Four’s most recent Grammy success came earlier this year, when a new animated video for the group’s 1966 song “I’m Only Sleeping” collected the Best Music Video honor.",

    "text": "- Leighton Bester from Salford says spooky encounters happen daily in his home - The incidents began after he found a coin in his neighbours thudding cupboard A man claims objects in his flat have started moving around the house of their own accord after he brought home an historic coin. Leighton Bester, from Salford, shared a clip on TikTok of one of his chairs dramatically skidding across his room, seemingly without any human help, in what he claims is a sign of ‘paranormal activity’. The 34-year-old claims this is one of many spooky activities to have taken place in his flat since he found a 1965 Winston Churchill coin in his neighbour’s cupboard and brought it home with him. As the clip continues, Leighton’s blinds appear to rotate sharply, again with no apparent human interference, and he says he’s bringing in a priest to solve the problem. He says in the clip: ‘I’m leaving…that’s the last straw now guys. I’m going to have to f g move out tonight.’ Leighton Bester (pictured) regularly captures bone-chilling ‘paranormal’ happenings in his home and he claims it all began because of coin Leighton claims the ‘entity’ has been causing havoc multiple times a day – at every hour – for the last week. The 34-year-old added the unusual incidents started when he found a 1965 Winston Churchill coin in his neighbours’ locked kitchen cupboard. ‘I noticed strange things happening a week ago. The first incident was loud banging coming from a kitchen cupboard,’ he said. The strange encounters began instantaneously after he returned to his flat with the coin. Admitting he felt ‘more vulnerable’ when the light were off in the beginning, Leighton has grown accustomed to the spooky incidents. ‘I’m not sure how and why this started. I think it has something to do with the coin I found and that it must be cursed or something,’ he said ‘When it first started it was scary but now it’s more annoying than anything else. It’s like having a mischievous flatmate.’ He added: ‘I’m not part of the paranormal community and don’t really believe in ghosts but I can’t explain what’s going on. ‘Things can’t just move by themselves. I think it’s some sort of ‘energy’ that’s attached itself to me.’ But the mysterious ‘entity’ isn’t your typical Casper the ghost, as the 34-year-old claims chairs slamming against the floor, blinds sharply moving and the television switching on-and-off occurs at every hour of the day He believes the spooky encounters were sparked by a 1965 Winston Churchill coin he found in his neighbours thudding kitchen cupboard After leaving TikTok users completely shocked by ‘authentic’ and ‘raw’ footage, Leighton revealed many had urged him to contact a priest or a medium. He said: ‘I’ve not physically seen anything.. People are saying it’s a ghost or poltergeist and even maybe a demon. ‘Thousands of people from the paranormal community have commented on my videos saying that a priest or a medium could help but it could also make things much worse.’ Hitting back at doubters, Leighton alleged that the even experts, who attempted to debunk his videos, have failed. ‘Doubters are becoming believers. Paranormal experts and digital editing experts around the world have tried debunking my videos, ‘But they can’t be debunked as its raw footage recorded from my phone while it’s in my hands, and the activity is right in front of peoples eyes to see.’ The online paranormal community have urged him to seek help from a medium or priest, however Leighton shared that he is more annoyed than scared by his unwelcomed flatmate Even though his family and friends are worried, Leighton is more irritated by constantly having to close his blinds. ‘I’m sick of getting up to close my blinds after they open, and having the lights and the TV turn off,’ he said ‘I’m starting to get used to it now but some things still spook me out sometimes. I don’t know what potential new things could start happening so I’m always on guard. ‘There is nothing I can really do except put up with it until I’ve figured out how to stop it all.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13117303/Flickering-lights-slamming-chairs-daily-cursed-coin.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",
