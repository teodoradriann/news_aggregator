    "text": "Russia prepares to test Burevestnik with a nuclear charge: what satellites show.\nJournalist\nShostal Oleksandr\nRussia seems to be preparing for a new test of the cruise missile with a nuclear charge 'Burevestnik', even in connection with the upcoming negotiations between Presidents Putin and Trump regarding the situation in Ukraine. Satellite images show an increase in military activity at the Pankovo training ground in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.\nSatellite evidence of preparation\nJeffrey Lewis and Decker Eveland analyzed images from Planet Labs and found a significant increase in the number of personnel, equipment, and aircraft related to the tests of 'Burevestnik'. A Western source confirmed readiness for the missile test, possibly even this week.\nWe see all this activity at the test site, especially the large number of supplies and movement in the areas where missiles are actually launched — emphasized Lewis.\nFormer U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tom Countryman believes that the missile launch could be expedited for political reasons.\nCharacteristics and experts' doubts\nPutin claims that 'Burevestnik' has no analogues among missile defense systems and has an unpredictable flight trajectory. Experts doubt the missile's ability to bypass defense systems and emphasize the risk of radiation contamination. The supply of weapons to Ukraine will continue despite negotiations with Putin.\nUkrainian intelligence is undertaking a comprehensive strategy to limit Russia's military potential, including remote strikes and acts of sabotage.\nUkraine continues to support its army and collaborates with allies to reduce the impact of Russian military actions in the region. By preparing for the test of the 'Burevestnik' missile, Russia is pushing the situation to a dangerous point at its own peril, which could have unpredictable consequences for the entire world.\nRead also",

    "title": "Massachusetts on verge of becoming second-to-last state to outlaw 'revenge porn'",
    "text": "A bill aimed at outlawing “revenge porn” has been approved by lawmakers in the Massachusetts House and Senate and shipped to Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, a move advocates say was long overdue. If signed by Healey, the bill — which bars the sharing of explicit images or videos without the consent of those depicted in the videos — would leave South Carolina as the only state not to have a law specifically banning revenge porn. Recommended Videos Supports say the bill, which landed on Healey's desk Thursday, would align Massachusetts with the other 48 states that have clear prohibitions on disseminating sexually explicit images and videos without the subject’s consent. It is a form of abuse that advocates say has grown increasingly common in the digital age, subjecting people to social and emotional harm often inflicted by former romantic partners. The bill would make disseminating nude or partially nude photos of another person without their permission criminal harassment. Offenders would face up to two and a half years in prison and a fine of $10,000. On subsequent offenses, the punishment would increase to up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $15,000. “No person’s life should devolve into chaos because a private photo was shared without their permission, and no person should fear coercion or be threatened with the sharing of such a photo,\" Senate President Karen Spilka said. The bill explicitly states that even though a person might consent to the initial creation of an explicit image or video that doesn't mean they are also agreeing that it can be distributed without their additional consent in the future. The advent of artificial intelligence and deepfake technology in the creation of revenge porn has added to the concerns of lawmakers. Supporters said the bill opens the door to legislation further addressing the implications of the emerging technology. Karissa Hand, an aide to Healey, said the governor, who was previously the state’s attorney general, “has long supported legislation to ban revenge porn and hold accountable those who would engage in abusive, coercive and deeply harmful behavior” and looks forward to reviewing any legislation that reaches her desk. The legislation establishes a definition for coercive control to account for non-physical forms of abuse such as isolation, threatening harm toward a family member or pet, controlling or monitoring activities, damaging property, publishing sensitive information, and repeated legal action. Advocates describe coercive control as a pattern of deliberate behavior by an abuser that substantially restricts another person’s safety and autonomy. By expanding the statute of limitation for domestic violence charges to 15 years, the bill would also give survivors a longer time to seek justice. Under current law, minors who possess, purchaseor share explicit photos of themselves or other minors are charged with violating child pornography laws and are required to register as sex offenders. The bill would instead require the state attorney general to develop an educational diversion program to provide adolescents who engage in revenge porn with information about the consequences and life-altering effects caused by engaging in the behavior. District attorneys would still have the authority to petition the court to bring criminal charges in extreme cases. Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, called passage of the bill in the Legislature “a milestone for survivors in Massachusetts.” “Non-consensual sharing of intimate images impacts thousands of people in Massachusetts every year, and increases an individual’s likelihood of further sexual harm,” the group said in a written statement. “This bill takes a thoughtful approach to addressing the problem - one that balances strong protections for survivors with a recognition that younger people who cause this harm often can and should benefit from educational diversion over prosecution,” the group added.",

    "text": "At this year’s Easter Vigil on March 30, the evening of Holy Saturday, Peterson’s conversion story reached a new height. Peterson joined eight fellow parishioners for Confirmation, with an additional three receiving the Sacrament of Baptism, at Holy Rosary Church in midtown Toronto. Peterson’s miraculous healing and conversion story is one that has gained traction. The story went viral after it was published in The Catholic Register at the end of October. Sachin Jose, a Catholic journalist and social media consultant, said Peterson’s conversion is “inspiring” and impactful. Jose notes that “social media has become the primary media avenue for evangelization” and it showed when Peterson’s story was told. “With a simple post, we can reach millions of people,” said Sachin, who has nearly 150,000 followers on X, formerly Twitter. “When we post about (Peterson’s husband) Jordan’s comments on Catholicism or related topics, the impressions skyrocket within hours,” he said. “People often share their conversion experiences below his YouTube videos.” Peterson said she was “quite astounded” at the response to her story, including meeting people on the street who congratulate and welcome her to the Catholic faith. “I kind of feel like we are in the time of Noah and it’s time to batten down the hatches, and I think that (choosing) the Catholic Church and all its doctrines is like battening down the hatches, not leaving anything to chance,” was her response to the question: “Why did you choose the Catholic Church?” “You just have to make sure that everything is where it needs to be because a storm is coming.” she said in an exclusive interview last September. Peterson is just one of the 1,467 catechumens received into full communion with the Catholic Church during the Easter Vigil Masses in the Archdiocese of Toronto this year, with thousands more entering the Church across the nation. It is fitting that Holy Rosary pastor Fr. Peter Turrone, himself a convert from atheism, is the catechist for the catechumens and converts at his parish. Turrone knows the inner workings of a scientist’s mind: He is a PhD graduate of the collaborative program in neuroscience from the University of Toronto. Turrone’s scientific and empirical background helped Reese Harris, 30, one of the catechumens, to appreciate the deep mystery of the Trinity. Harris said Turrone explained it to him this way: “The best way to look at it is like water, (the Holy Trinity) can be gas, ice and steam but it’s all the same thing, but it can show in different forms.” Over time, Turrone said his cynicism and unbelief were radically transformed after understanding the compatibility of faith and reason. While pursuing an academic career in science at the University of Toronto, Turrone said he experienced an “existential crisis” after reading St. Augustine’s Confessions. “I know what it’s like to live without faith,” he said. “Now, as a Catholic priest, as a man of faith, I know what it’s like to live with faith,” he continued. “I know science can’t prove the existence of God. But the whole universe and everything screams His presence, and so (atheism) is no longer intellectually defensible.” Queenie Yu is another Catholic convert, after being introduced to Mother Mary and the Rosary in university. “Our Lady had such a profound impact on my life that I introduced Our Lady to (Peterson),” said Yu, who is Peterson’s Confirmation sponsor. Yu is a numerary member of Opus Dei and character development director at Hawthorn School for Girls. She had been an acquaintance of Peterson’s back then. Now, she is a trusted friend. After bringing Peterson a Rosary blessed by Pope Francis, Yu invited her to pray while she underwent cancer treatments. And so they did, every morning at 10 o’clock in the atrium of Toronto General Hospital for five straight weeks. It was at that time, while she was hospitalized and endured painful medical scans, that Peterson learned and adopted the practice of prayer without ceasing. Several doctors were valiantly trying to find and fix the source of lymphatic leakage in her body, unfortunately without success. The illness wreaked havoc on her body: that summer, her hair fell out, she felt cold all the time and her weight plummeted to 90 pounds. Before that latest health crisis, Peterson had been told she only had 10 months to live. The link between the Catholic Mass and the Rosary is the connection between Jesus and His Blessed Mother, and the Cross and the Resurrection intertwined. Turrone, Yu and Peterson all said they share an affinity to Mother Mary and the Rosary. “(The Rosary) is recognizing the role of the Virgin Mary in salvation history and seeing redemption through Mary’s eyes and accompanying Mary,” Turrone said. Peterson revealed that she had been drawn to Catholicism because of Our Lady. “I think probably deep down I was Catholic all along because when I was a kid in school in the Protestant church, I used to yearn for stories and prayers that were based around Mary,” she said. Turrone said that each of the joyful, sorrowful, glorious and luminous mysteries reflect “how our own lives are intricately tied in a mysterious way to the Rosary.” The Rosary has been called “the poor man’s Bible” which illustrates “the joys, the suffering, the sorrows, the Passion, and then confronting the reality of death and the certainty of the Resurrection,” he said. The Peterson family has walked through its own valleys and experienced dark nights of the soul: Their daughter, Mikhaila, battled chronic illness during childhood. “She was diagnosed with many, many joint replacements when she was seven years old,” Peterson said. “She was very sick … I didn’t know any formal prayer. I just prayed to my Mom.” In recent years, Peterson and her husband, best-selling author and Canadian psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, spent some time apart after Jordan’s own brush with death, with his health having deteriorated rapidly after his wife’s cancer diagnosis. “My husband was so sad. He was so worried about me,” she said. Yet Peterson said she was inspired by her newfound faith when she confidently informed her husband she would recover by their 30th wedding anniversary on Aug. 19, 2019. It was on the fifth day of her praying the Novena for the Sick to St. Josemaria Escriva, the founder of Opus Dei, that she was gifted the miraculous recovery. During the last three months of Peterson’s preparation for Easter, she confronted the reality of life and death once again, grieving the loss of her beloved father before Christmas. William Waddell Roberts, affectionately known as “Dell,” was 92. A former town councillor and hospital board member in Fairview, Alta., Roberts worked as a telegrapher for the Northern Alberta Railway until it closed and became an entrepreneur afterwards. Peterson spoke with Turrone about her grief during their online Catechism class. Turrone invited her to seek consolation directly from God. “If you take your suffering to God and then it fills you up, you can give to those people that you love and then they will give back to you, and that’s the way the Church fathers tell us to deal with our suffering,” she said. Peterson’s fifth grandchild, George, was born just hours after her father’s death on Dec. 11. The newborn was given the middle name Waddell by Mikhaila, in honour of Peterson’s father. “It wasn’t actually really apparent to me until that moment and so I’m grateful to my Dad for dying on that day that baby was born because I guess he knew that I would be alone and that I would have to understand my grief more thoroughly, and so I felt much relief since then,” she said. At Easter, the Rosary’s mysteries will come to life and come full circle: Peterson and her fellow converts will witness Jesus’ sacrifice on the Cross in the broken body of the Eucharist as they receive their first Holy Communion. The spiritual threads of conversion, Our Lady and the Rosary will be tied together in the dramatic Biblical symbolism of leaving the darkness to come into the light at the Easter Vigil. Turrone explained that the Vigil always begins in darkness which dissipates after a fire is lit outside the church. Next, the Easter candle is lit, and the Biblical passage “Let there be light” is read. Recalling the Old Testament and “the sacred fire that spoke to Moses,” to the New Testament and the light of the candle representing Jesus, “we recognize that Jesus Christ Himself is God and that He is the only light of the world,” Turrone said. One person receives and passes the light of the candle to another, Turrone said, “so we also see the communal nature of our faith is through it spreading (by) the word of mouth that we come to know our faith.” “We are able to remember actively what God has done for us, so all of salvation history is presented to us in the (Easter Vigil) liturgy under the sign of symbols,” he said. With that same reception of the Holy Eucharist, the source and summit of the Christian life, as Turrone has taught the catechumens and converts from the Catechism of the Catholic Church, they will also realize the Easter mystery and the promise, hope, love and victory of the Risen Jesus. Like the Easter flames that illuminate the church at the start of the Easter Vigil Mass, progressively bringing light from one candle to the next, the Catholic Church continues to grow. The mysteries of the Holy Rosary continue its unending chain of faith in this sacred edifice bearing the same name; to Peterson and her fellow catechumens and converts, it is a welcome home.",
