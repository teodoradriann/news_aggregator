    "title": "When Jasprit Bumrah Plays, India Lose More: Former England Player",
    "text": "In the ongoing five-match Test series in England, India have lost two games that they should have won. Shubman Gill and Co. allowed England to chase down 371 in the first Test, and then failed to chase 193 in the third Test at Lord’s - handing the hosts a 2-1 lead in the series.\nJasprit Bumrah featured in both of those defeats. Interestingly, the one Test he missed - the second in Birmingham - saw India register a record 336-run victory. Prior to the series, Bumrah had informed the team management that he would play only three of the five Tests to manage his workload.\nIndia must win the fourth Test in Manchester, starting on July 23, to keep the series alive. While it seems ideal for Bumrah to play this all-important encounter, former England cricketer David Lloyd believes that playing the fourth Test could force the Indian management to also push him into the fifth if the series gets leveled in Manchester.\nSpeaking to TalkSport Cricket, Lloyd said: \"It is what they've said and what coach Gautam Gambhir said - that he will play three out of the five Tests. So, he's got a choice. There are two matches to go. He's played two. If they are true to their words, he should play this next game at Old Trafford. But then, you know, they can manoeuvre that, can't they?\n\"If he plays this next one at Old Trafford and they get a result to make it 2-2, you'd think he'd play at The Oval as well. I'm second-guessing, but I think he'll play this next game and see where they are. If England go 3-1, he won't play. But if it's 2-2, he will play at The Oval.\"\nSince his debut, Bumrah has featured in 47 Tests, with India recording 20 wins and 23 losses in those games. During the same period, he has missed 27 Tests - India have won 19, lost just five, and drawn three of those matches.\nEven in the second Test at Birmingham, India’s pace unit stepped up in his absence, with Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep taking 17 wickets between them.\n\"That's extraordinary. There was something that said when he plays they lose more than when he doesn't play, and he is like the best bowler in the world. And he is awkward and nasty with his action, but a thoroughly decent fella,\" Lloyd added.",

    "text": "[Endpoint Security](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/endpoint-security-c-506) , [Geo Focus: Asia](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/geo-focus-asia-c-521) , [Geo-Specific](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/geo-specific-c-518) Singapore to Affix Cyber Safety Labels to Medical Devices Health Services Authority Labels to Show 4 Levels of Cybersecurity AssuranceSingapore launched a voluntary plan to assign cybersecurity ratings to medical devices to help healthcare institutions make informed choices and protect their networks and patient data from cyberattacks. See Also: [An MDR Case Study: Protecting Your Valuable Health Assets with Innovative Cybersecurity](https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/whitepapers/mdr-case-study-protecting-your-valuable-health-assets-innovative-w-11158?rf=RAM_SeeAlso) The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore [said](https://www.csa.gov.sg/News-Events/Press-Releases/2024/launch-of-cybersecurity-labelling-scheme-for-medical-devices) Wednesday the new Cybersecurity Labeling Scheme for Medical Devices seeks to improve medical device security by \"incentivizing manufacturers to adopt a security-by-design approach.\" The rating system applies to medical devices and equipment that can be connected to other devices, systems and services, as well as those that handle personally identifiable information and clinical data. The agency said cybersecurity labels assigned to medical devices will expires after three years, and must be renewed by manufacturers . Medical devices must undergo testing by independent ISO 17025-accredited testing laboratories prior to receiving certification. The agency can revoke labels if the manufacturer does not comply with cybersecurity requirements associated with each label. The Cyber Security Agency began [working on](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/announcements/regulatory-updates/public-consultation-for-the-proposed-framework-and-implementation-of-the-cybersecurity-labelling-scheme-for-medical-devices-cls(md)) the rating system after seeking public comment in January 2023. CSA and Singapore's Ministry of Health held a sandbox phase between October 2023 and July 2024 and invited dozens of medical device manufacturers to undergo cybersecurity testing and provide feedback. \"The trial has provided critical insights and very useful feedback from the medical device manufacturers,\" said minister of state for Health Janil Puthucheary. \"This proactive engagement has been crucial in honing the scheme, refining how it works, setting a solid foundation for its broader implementation.\" Addressing a gathering at the International IoT Security Roundtable Event Wednesday, Puthucheary [said](https://www.mddi.gov.sg/opening-address-by-sms-janil-puthucheary-at-the-international-iot-security-roundtable-event/) cybersecurity labeling is built on a successful similar program for smart connected devices launched in 2020. According to the agency, medical devices undergoing cybersecurity testing will be assigned one of four ratings. Level 1 rating applies to devices that fulfill baseline cybersecurity requirements, level 2 applies to those that meet enhanced cybersecurity requirements, level 3 to those that pass independent third-party software binary analysis and penetration testing, and level 4 applies to devices that pass independent third-party software binary analysis and security evaluation. To be approved for public use, medical devices must to be registered with the Health Services Authority and meet basic cybersecurity requirements, similar to Level 1 requirement under the voluntary labeling scheme. Puthucheary said the World Health Organization and the Global Digital Health Partnership will soon publish their Guidance for Medical Device Cybersecurity based on Singapore's voluntary labeling scheme requirements. \"This guidance note will be used to guide medical device manufacturers and healthcare delivery organizations worldwide on cybersecurity features to consider when developing and deploying medical devices,\" he said. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has also been working to raise cybersecurity standards for medical devices. A policy that went into effect last year for the FDA to \"refuse to accept\" premarket submissions for new medical devices if they lack required cybersecurity details aims to also improve the state of legacy devices in the future as they age out (see: [How FDA's New Policy Aims to Improve Medical Device Security]( /how-fdas-new-policy-aims-to-improve-medical-device-security-a-21686)).",

    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) – France has expelled a Tunisian Muslim cleric for “radicalism” and “unacceptable remarks”, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on Twitter.\n“The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory, less than 12 hours after his arrest. We will not let people get away with anything,” Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nIn an earlier statement, Darmanin said he had given instructions to issue a ministerial deportation order against “this radical ‘imam’ with unacceptable remarks”. “Firmness is the rule,” he added.\nIn a post that went viral on social media and was widely reported in French media, the imam referred to “the three-coloured flag” as “satanic”.\nMahjoubi, who preached in the Ettaouba mosque of Bagnols-sur-Ceze, southern France, has denied any wrongdoing. He told French media that his comments had been taken out of context and that he had not meant to disrespect the French flag. The French flag has three colours: blue, white and red.\nHis lawyer told French media he will appeal the expulsion procedure.\nFrench media published excerpts of the expulsion order, which stated that Mahjoubi had “conveyed a literal, backward, intolerant, and violent conception of Islam, likely to encourage behaviors contrary to the values of the Republic, discrimination against women, identity retreat, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization’.”\nBFM reported that Mahjoubi was being held in administrative detention in the Paris region.\nDarmanin did not specify where the imam had been held nor when, how and where to he was expelled.\nFranceinfo reported that Mahjoubi was on a plane headed to Tunis on Thursday evening.\nDarmanin said that the French government’s new immigration law, voted earlier this year, had allowed for the quick expulsion of the imam.\nWith the far-right RN party leading in polls for European elections in June, President Emmanuel Macron is under pressure to be tough on immigration and identity issues.\n(Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

    "text": "A solo un mes del arranque de la temporada regular, los Saraperos de Saltillo siguen afinando su preparación en el campamento de pretemporada, con avances notables tanto en lo físico como en lo estratégico.\nEste miércoles, el lanzador sinaloense Mario Meza se integró a los entrenamientos tras una exitosa temporada invernal con los Charros de Jalisco, donde se coronó campeón y estuvo muy cerca de conquistar la Serie del Caribe.\n“Estoy muy contento de regresar a Saltillo. Gracias a Dios tuve una gran temporada con los Charros, logramos el campeonato y estuvimos muy cerca de ganar la Serie del Caribe. Ahora mi enfoque está en ayudar a Saraperos a llegar lo más lejos posible, clasificar a la postemporada y pelear por el título”, declaró Meza.\nEl experimentado lanzador tuvo un desempeño destacado en 2024 con Saraperos, registrando una efectividad de 2.90 y un WHIP de 1.38, además de conseguir la impresionante hazaña de no permitir cuadrangulares por segunda temporada consecutiva, consolidándose como una pieza clave en el bullpen del equipo.\nAdemás de Meza, otro refuerzo que se ha sumado recientemente al equipo es el infielder Alfredo Reyes, originario de Sabana Grande de Palenque, República Dominicana, quien aportará profundidad y versatilidad al cuadro de los Saraperos.\nLos entrenamientos continuarán este jueves en el Estadio Francisco I. Madero a partir de las 10:00 am, donde el equipo seguirá trabajando para llegar en óptimas condiciones al inicio de la temporada. La afición de Saltillo sigue de cerca cada movimiento del equipo, con la esperanza de verlos competir por el ansiado campeonato.\nTE PUEDE INTERESAR: Facultad de Ciencias Químicas de la UAdeC reafirma su liderazgo en ciencia y tecnología\nReportera Digital: María Saucedo\nNRT MÉXICO COBERTURA TOTAL 360",

    "text": "Students in the Bi-Cultural Hebrew Academy middle school recently had the opportunity to compete in the Math Olympiad program. This global entity is a math problem solving contest for teams of students in grades four through eight. Each month, from November through March, participants from around the world take a test and then receive immediate feedback on their work.\nThe tests at BCHA are administered by middle school mathematics teacher Darren Bahar. The purpose of the program is to stimulate enthusiasm and a love for mathematics, develop mathematical flexibility in solving problems, and foster mathematical creativity and ingenuity.\nBahar reported on the results for all grades. “Thirty-five students took the test. We had 13 students score a 3/5 on the Math Olympiad! In fourth grade, we had Evan D. score a 4/5 and Gavriel O. score a 4/5. In fifth grade, we had Lila K. score a 5/5. Eitan O. and Ron M-T, both scored a 4/5. In sixth grade, we had Shia M. score a 5/5. Eli L. and Alexander S. both scored a 4/5. That means 21/35 students scored 3/5 or above, which is not only astonishing but our best result in five years!”\nIn the seventh grade: Yuval G. and Yaakov O. both got a 3/5. In eighth grade, Layla B., Hannah H. and Aaron P. all got 3/5. Noam K. got 4/5. Noa M-T. and Miles W. got 5/5.\n“These are truly amazing results,” Bahar remarked. “This version of the test is incredibly challenging.”",
