    "text": "Revolución en el reciclaje: descomponen plástico con la humedad del aire\n\"Nuestro estudio ofrece una solución sostenible y eficiente a uno de los desafíos ambientales más acuciantes del mundo: los residuos plásticos\", explica uno de los científicos a cargo del trabajo.\nAprovechando la humedad del aire, químicos de la Universidad Northwestern han desarrollado un nuevo método sencillo para descomponer los residuos plásticos, indica un nuevo descubrimiento. Este proceso, no tóxico, ecológico y sin disolventes, utiliza primero un catalizador económico para romper los enlaces del tereftalato de polietileno (PET), el plástico más común de la familia del poliéster. Posteriormente, los investigadores simplemente exponen los fragmentos rotos al aire ambiente. Aprovechando las trazas de humedad del aire, el PET descompuesto se convierte en monómeros, los componentes esenciales de los plásticos. A partir de ahí, los investigadores prevén que los monómeros podrían reciclarse en nuevos productos de PET u otros materiales más valiosos.\nMás segura, limpia, económica y sostenible que los métodos actuales de reciclaje de plástico, la nueva técnica, publicada en la revista Green Chemistry, ofrece un camino prometedor hacia la creación de una economía circular para los plásticos, según destaca la universidad en un comunicado.\n\"Estados Unidos es el mayor contaminante de plástico per cápita, y solo reciclamos el 5% de esos plásticos\", afirmó Yosi Kratish, de Northwestern, coautor del estudio. Existe una necesidad imperiosa de mejores tecnologías que puedan procesar diferentes tipos de residuos plásticos. La mayoría de las tecnologías disponibles actualmente funden botellas de plástico y las reciclan para obtener productos de menor calidad. Lo especialmente emocionante de nuestra investigación es que aprovechamos la humedad del aire para descomponer los plásticos, logrando un proceso excepcionalmente limpio y selectivo. Al recuperar los monómeros, que son los componentes básicos del PET, podemos reciclarlos o incluso supra-reciclarlos para obtener materiales más valiosos.\n\"Nuestro estudio ofrece una solución sostenible y eficiente a uno de los desafíos ambientales más acuciantes del mundo: los residuos plásticos\", afirmó Naveen Malik, primer autor del estudio. \"A diferencia de los métodos de reciclaje tradicionales, que a menudo producen subproductos nocivos como sales residuales y requieren un consumo considerable de energía o productos químicos, nuestro enfoque utiliza un proceso sin disolventes que se basa en la humedad residual del aire ambiente. Esto lo hace no solo respetuoso con el medio ambiente, sino también muy práctico para aplicaciones prácticas\".\nEl problema del plástico\nComúnmente utilizado en envases de alimentos y botellas de bebidas, el PET representa el 12 % del total de plásticos utilizados a nivel mundial. Debido a su dificultad para descomponerse, el PET contribuye significativamente a la contaminación plástica. Tras su uso, termina en vertederos o, con el tiempo, se degrada en diminutos microplásticos o nanoplásticos, que a menudo acaban en aguas residuales y cursos de agua.\nEncontrar nuevas formas de reciclar el plástico es un tema candente en la investigación. Sin embargo, los métodos actuales para descomponer los plásticos requieren condiciones rigurosas, como temperaturas extremadamente altas, un alto consumo de energía y disolventes, que generan subproductos tóxicos. Los catalizadores utilizados en estas reacciones suelen ser caros (como el platino y el paladio) o tóxicos, lo que genera residuos aún más dañinos. Tras la reacción, los investigadores deben separar los materiales reciclados de los disolventes, un proceso que puede requerir mucho tiempo y energía.\nSin disolventes\nEn trabajos anteriores, el grupo de Marks en Northwestern fue el primero en desarrollar procesos catalíticos que no requieren disolventes. En el nuevo estudio, el equipo ideó un proceso sin disolventes.\n\"Usar disolventes tiene muchas desventajas\", afirmó Kratish. \"Pueden ser caros y hay que calentarlos a altas temperaturas. Después de la reacción, se obtiene una mezcla de materiales que hay que clasificar para recuperar los monómeros. En lugar de usar disolventes, utilizamos vapor de agua del aire. Es una forma mucho más elegante de abordar los problemas del reciclaje de plástico\".\nVideo: construyen casas con botellas de plástico\nDpa.\n¿Hacia la paz?\nEstados Unidos pide a Europa que se implique en las charlas de paz de Ucrania\nPotencias en pugna\nReino Unido confiesa sentirse decepcionado por los aranceles de Donald Trump\nDescubrimiento\nAstrónomos captan pulsos de radio desde un sistema de estrellas enanas\nPerfil\nCómo ve el mundo el vicepresidente de EE.UU. y por qué es importante entenderlo\nDeportado\nLa peligrosa ruta de 10 países latinoamericanos que siguió un inmigrante indio\nConquista del espacio\nLa NASA lanza misiones para estudiar el sol y el origen de universo\nPoder bélico\nRusia sigue ganando la guerra: toma cinco localidades en su contraofensiva\nBalance de gestión",

    "title": "Medal of Honor Monday: Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard Etchberger > U.S. Department of Defense > Story",
    "text": "Many military men and women do heroic things that they can't get credit for because they're involved in classified missions. For Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard Loy Etchberger, he finally did get credit in the form of the Medal of Honor 42 years after he lost his life saving others during the Vietnam War.\nAir Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger Medal of Honor recipient Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger poses for a photo at Udorn Air Base, Thailand. It was taken shortly before his death in March 1968 during a battle at a secret U.S. radar site on a mountain peak in Laos.

He had an older brother named Robert.\nWhen their father lost his job after the Pearl Harbor attacks, both boys started to work odd jobs to help with finances. Eventually, the family moved to nearby Minersville, Pennsylvania, so his dad could find more work. There, Etchberger became a star basketball player and excelled in academics. His brother said it helped that he had a photographic memory.\n\"When he would go upstairs to study, he would be done in 10 minutes. Then, he was back downstairs doing whatever he wanted. That used to infuriate me because I couldn't learn my lessons that quickly,\" Robert Etchberger said in an interview for an article on the Airmen Memorial Museum website.\nAfter World War II ended, the family moved back to Hamburg, where Etchberger finished high school. He was the senior class president by the time he graduated in 1951.\nA few weeks later, Etchberger enlisted in the Air Force. He initially wanted to be a pilot, his brother said, but due to an injury that lingered from his basketball days, he washed out of aviation school. Instead, he was trained as a radio operator and came to be known to be an electronics whiz.\nAir Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger A photo of Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L.

The pair married in 1956, with Etchberger taking on the role of stepfather to Catherine's son, Steve. By 1959, they had two more sons, Richard and Cory.\nIn August 1965, Etchberger and the whole family were transferred to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Aside from his standard duties there, Etchberger was also the communications and electronics noncommissioned officer in charge of a radar control post on Hon Tree Island in Vietnam, where the U.S. was now at war.\nSpotlight: Commemorating the Vietnam War\nAfter a brief stint back in the U.S., Etchberger was assigned to the 1043rd Radar Evaluation Squadron and placed on a top-secret Air Force/CIA mission code-named Project Heavy Green. It called for Etchberger and a small team to go to a small radar station on top of a remote mountain in Laos that was being used to direct U.S. air support to North Vietnam during the early years of the war.\nThe mission wasn't easy to join. Etchberger and the other airmen involved needed to be released from the Air Force and hired by Lockheed Corporation to avoid giving the perception that Laos was involved with the U.S. government in the war. When the mission was over, the airmen would be welcomed back into the Air Force.\nA view of the ridgeline of Phou Pha Thi mountain and the Combat Sky Spot radar site known as Lima Site 85.

From that mountainous jungle perch, which was only 12 miles from North Vietnam, about 40 airmen controlled hundreds of air strikes into enemy territory during the 1968 Rolling Thunder campaign.\nThe North Vietnamese knew the value of the site, so they made many attempts to take it out. None were successful until March 10, 1968, when they began to attack the site with heavy artillery. By nightfall, Etchberger and his off-duty team realized their sleeping quarters were vulnerable to the shelling, so they hid with their guns and survival radios on a ledge partially protected by a rocky overhang for the rest of the night.\nEarly the next morning, enemy commandos scaled the cliff the compound was on, killing 11 of the 19 Americans working at the site. While Etchberger's team was initially spared, it didn't take long for the enemy to find them and start attacking, killing two airmen and seriously injuring two others.\nSince Etchberger was a radar technician, he didn't have any formal combat training. But that didn't stop him from picking up arms and defending their position. For hours, Etchberger single-handedly held off the enemy with an M-16 rifle, all while calling for air rescue and directing air strikes that were practically right on top of him.\nOnce rescuers arrived, Etchberger risked his own life several times, running through heavy fire to put three of his wounded comrades into rescue slings hanging from the hovering rescue helicopter. But when he finally climbed into the sling himself and was lifted to the chopper, he was hit by a burst of gunfire. Etchberger survived the initial helicopter flight, but he died before he could be transported for further medical treatment.\nEtchberger, who had turned 35 the week prior, gave his own life to save the lives of his remaining crew. Of the 19 men on the mountain that night, only seven made it out alive — three of them thanks to Etchberger's actions.\nMedal Ceremony Chief Master Sgt. Richard Etchberger’s wife, Catherine, receives his posthumous Air Force Cross from Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John McConnell at a private Pentagon ceremony in 1969. Catherine Etchberger was sworn to secrecy about the mission that led to her husband’s death because it was classified. His Air Force Cross did not become public knowledge until 1998.

Nine months after the mission, his wife, who accepted the honor on his behalf, was told the real story of what happened to her husband; however, she was sworn to secrecy. Etchberger's sons didn't even learn the truth until the late 1980's when the details were finally declassified.\nOnce his actions were no longer a secret, they remained relatively hidden in the past until the early 2000's. That's when Air Force Master Sgt. Robert Dilley read about Etchberger's heroism and thought more should be done to honor him. Dilley wrote his local congressman, and, together, they began a years-long movement to have Etchberger recognized with the Medal of Honor.\nThat dream came to fruition on Sept. 21, 2010, when Etchberger's sons received the nation's highest medal for valor in their father's name from President Barack Obama during a White House ceremony.\nMedal Ceremony President Barack Obama presents the Medal of Honor posthumously to the sons of Air Force Chief Master Sgt.

Richard Etchberger received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in combat in Laos on March 11, 1968, after deliberately exposing himself to enemy fire in order to place three surviving wounded comrades in rescue slings, which permitted them to be airlifted to safety.

Various Air Force bases have renamed streets and buildings for him, including Barksdale Air Force Base, which also displays his name etched in a granite monument. Etchberger's family donated his chief's uniform and various other items to a display honoring him at the Air Force Senior NCO Academy at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.\nBench Monument Robert Etchberger, the brother of Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger, admires a newly unveiled bench monument in honor of his brother at the 50th anniversary memorial service of Lima Site 85 at Gunter Annex on Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., March 12. 2018. Lima Site 85 was the location of a covert operation during the Vietnam War where about a dozen Americans went missing or lost their lives fighting the enemy, including Etchberger, who was killed during extraction. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 for his heroic actions that saved three lives that day.

    "text": "Tres turistas de Yellowstone condenados a cárcel por infringir normas en áreas protegidas del parque. Tres visitantes del Parque Nacional de Yellowstone fueron condenados el mes pasado a penas breves de cárcel por delitos menores no relacionados, dijeron los fiscales federales, lo que enfatiza la necesidad de seguridad en las zonas protegidas del parque. Dos visitantes que se desviaron de senderos o caminos señalizados de manera clara en zonas termales del parque fueron condenados a siete días de cárcel cada uno, según la fiscalía del distrito de Wyoming . Un tercer visitante fue condenado a 10 días por conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol en el parque, dijeron las autoridades.\nLos tres fueron condenados por violaciones de terrenos públicos ocurridas durante el otoño pasado, y sus condenas se dictaron pocas semanas antes de que comience la temporada alta de turismo en Yellowstone, cuya mayor parte se encuentra en Wyoming .\n“La prioridad número 1 es la seguridad pública , pero los recursos naturales también son importantes en lugares como el Parque Nacional de Yellowstone ”, dijo Lori Hogan, responsable de asuntos públicos de la fiscalía de Wyoming. “Las infracciones más peligrosas, como entrar en un área térmica o trastocar la vida salvaje, podrían llevar a penas de cárcel, mientras que las infracciones menores podrían dar lugar a multas o advertencias”, explicó.\nCaminar por los terrenos termales de Yellowstone puede ser extremadamente peligroso, dijeron los responsables del parque, debido a que el suelo es frágil y delgado, y el agua hirviendo debajo de la superficie puede causar quemaduras graves o mortales. Hay más de 24 kilómetros de caminos establecidos para que los turistas puedan observar los atractivos termales de Yellowstone, como géiseres y aguas termales . Los caminos, claramente señalizados, protegen también el entorno inestable, señalaron las autoridades.\nInstrumentan dureza legal para proteger áreas frágiles y recursos naturales en Yellowstone. (Visit The USA) La zona de observación que rodea al géiser Old Faithful es una de las atracciones más populares del parque, y fue allí donde los responsables dijeron que Angela Flaherty , de 44 años, de Seattle, se desvió unos 3 metros del camino establecido y cayó sobre el cono del Old Faithful . Otro visitante del parque grabó sus acciones en video. Flaherty fue condenada el 19 de marzo a una pena de siete días el mes pasado y se le ordenó pagar 40 dólares en concepto de costos judiciales obligatorios.\nYiyang Shen , de 25 años, procedente de Doraville , Georgia, fue condenado el 12 de marzo a siete días de cárcel. Condujo fuera de un camino, aparcó su vehículo en una zona termal y caminó por el área prohibida, dijeron los fiscales. Shen dañó recursos del parque, aseguraron las autoridades. Estará en libertad condicional sin supervisión durante cinco años —y no podrá visitar Yellowstone en ese tiempo— y se le ordenó pagar 1050 dólares en multas y costos judiciales.\nDouglas Wolfley , de 49 años, de Fairview , Wyoming, fue condenado el 18 de marzo a 10 días de cárcel tras declararse culpable de conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol en Yellowstone, su tercera condena por conducir bajo los efectos de sustancias en 10 años. Se le impusieron tres años de libertad condicional sin supervisión , durante los cuales se le prohibirá la entrada al parque, y se le ordenó pagar 3050 dólares en multas y costos judiciales.\nLos turistas que reciben condenas por infracciones en el parque no están obligados a cumplirlas en Wyoming , dijeron funcionarios de la fiscalía. Normalmente, las cumplen en una cárcel cercana a su lugar de residencia.\nShen dijo que había esperado resolver el asunto con una multa , pero señaló que respetaba la sentencia porque no había seguido las normas locales. En su defensa, Shen indicó que no sabía que estaba prohibido conducir fuera de las carreteras asfaltadas .\nCasi 20 muertes por quemaduras en fuentes termales se reportan en Yellowstone desde 1872. (REUTERS/Jim Urquhart) Wolfley , al ser localizado, dijo que “las multas eran bastante excesivas y el castigo bastante extremo”. Los intentos de contactar con Flaherty por teléfono y correo electrónico no tuvieron éxito.\nLas autoridades de Wyoming citaron casos similares como advertencia a los turistas. El año pasado, un turista fue condenado a una semana de cárcel por ignorar las señalizaciones que decían que era ilegal salir de la zona del camino establecido.\nEn 2024, el actor Pierce Brosnan , quien caminó por una zona termal, fue condenado a pagar una multa de 500 dólares y a hacer un donativo de 1000 dólares a Yellowstone Forever , una organización sin fines de lucro asociada al parque.\nCasi dos decenas de personas han muerto por quemaduras sufridas tras entrar o caer en una fuente termal de Yellowstone desde que se inauguró el parque en 1872, según el Servicio Geológico de Estados Unidos .\nSusan C.

    "title": "O menino Jesus é uma criança palestina e um sinal de vitória | Revista Fórum",
    "text": "Meu menino Jesus está ferido, mas vivo. Perdeu um braço, mas faz o sinal de vitória com a mão que lhe sobrou. E ainda sorri, porque meu menino Jesus é palestino, é valente, é semente, como o primeiro menino Jesus, aquele que prenderam na cruz. Meu menino Jesus talvez seja uma menina, porque não fica claro a que sexo pertence essa criança ferida por Israel, que objetivava matá-la, como Herodes e os que condenaram Jesus à cruz, mas não conseguiram. Minha criança Jesus é isso, criança, nascida antes do evento que todos esperamos, a meia noite da virada do dia 24 para 25 de dezembro, quando os cristãos comemoram, por convenção, o nascimento de Jesus Cristo, aquele menino, aquela criança que teria vindo ao mundo para nos salvar. Quantas Marias também não tentaram chegar a um lugar seguro neste Natal para o nascimento de seus filhos? Quantas Marias assassinadas pelas bombas de Israel entre as seis mil mulheres mortas até o momento? Pelo exército de Israel, com soldados que mandam fazer camisetas com uma mulher palestina grávida, um alvo desenhado sobre sua barriga e as palavras \"1 shot, 2 kill\". Uma bala, dois palestinos mortos. Quantas crianças Jesus não foram assassinadas até o momento? São quase oito mil. E continuam morrendo de morte matada, fria e covarde. Algumas Marias conseguiram chegar à maternidade. Mas Israel destruiu a maternidade. E elas tiveram que fugir. E saíram com suas barrigas, como a Maria original, aquela do Jesus original, à procura de um lugar para deixar nascer a criança que quer vir ao mundo, mesmo que parte do mundo, através das bombas e do silêncio e/ou apoio de muitos, queira assassiná-la, ainda no ventre. Algumas crianças nasceram prematuras, estavam em incubadoras no maior hospital de Gaza, aquela coleçãozinha de crianças Jesus, com oxigênio lhes escondendo boca e nariz, mas salvando-lhes a vida. Até que as forças de Israel tomaram o hospital, mandaram evacuá-lo e não ofereceram condições, nem permitiram que condições fossem criadas, para que aquelas crianças Jesus nas incubadoras pudessem enfim respirar o ar sem ser o do hospital. Todas aquelas crianças Jesus morreram. Como foram encontradas anteontem quatro Marias grávidas, ainda com os bebês em seus ventres, que simplesmente foram mortas e terraplanadas pelos tratores de Israel, que estão \"limpando\" Gaza, transformando-a num campo nivelado, onde antes havia prédios, apartamentos, casas, quartos, móveis, brinquedos, gente, crianças. Vida. Mas minha criança Jesus, apesar de tudo, sorri para a câmera e faz o sinal da vitória, como o pioneiro menino, que morreu aos 33, mas vive até hoje e até hoje nos faz sonhar com um mundo justo, onde as crianças possam nascer e viver e sejam sempre bem-vindas, nunca bombardeadas, assassinadas. Ainda hoje, uma mãe palestina dará à luz na Palestina ocupada e bombardeada, mesma terra onde nasceu o menino Jesus, uma criança que ainda teima em sua barriga. E é pra ela que a criança da foto faz o sinal de vitória. Porque é. E será. Sempre.
