    "title": "How AI is Transforming Fleet Management: Insights from Penske - Fleet Management - Trucking Info",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing everything from search engines to robotics, and trucking is no exception. AI is helping managers at heavy-duty trucking fleets make smarter decisions, reduce downtime, and improve efficiency in areas ranging from predictive maintenance to route optimization.\nBut AI can be overwhelming, even scary. What exactly does it do? How can it help your trucking company? Is it something you should be concerned about?\nTo help answer these questions, we turned to two experts from Penske Transportation Solutions.\nTim Haynes, vice president of digital and customer data, and Sam Thompson, VP of customer success and fleet telematics, shared their insights during a recent Leadership Insights interview.\n“A lot of people talk about AI like it’s some big, new thing,” Thompson said. “But the truth is, we’ve been using AI in trucking for quite a while — it’s just been working in the background.”\nAI: A Powerful but Invisible Tool\nAI isn’t just futuristic robots or self-driving trucks, she pointed out. It’s already part of our daily lives. If you use a smartphone, streaming service, or navigation app, you’re benefiting from artificial intelligence.\n“The best AI is very subtle,” Thompson explained. “It’s behind the scenes, helping to automate tasks and sift through massive amounts of data. It’s there to help people be more efficient.”\nIn trucking, AI is being used to analyze data, predict maintenance needs, optimize routes, and improve fleet performance, among other things.\n“The key thing to remember is AI isn’t replacing people — it’s assisting them,” Haynes said.\n“It’s just another tool, like a wrench or diagnostic software, that helps fleet managers and technicians do their jobs better.”\nAI in the Shop: Smarter Maintenance, Less Downtime\nOne of the biggest ways AI is transforming trucking is in the maintenance shop. For years, fleets have relied on scheduled maintenance to keep trucks running. But what if a truck could tell you when it’s about to have a problem?\nThat’s exactly what AI-powered predictive maintenance is doing.\n“Someone in our business years ago said he imagined a time when the truck could tell you when it was sick,” Haynes recalled. “That’s kind of what’s happening now.\n“AI looks at fault codes and patterns, then tells us, ‘Hey, this truck needs attention before it breaks down.’”\nHow AI Helps Pinpoint What's Really Urgent\nPenske has been using AI for predictive maintenance for years, analyzing data from more than 400,000 pieces of equipment, so the company knows what it’s talking about.\nInstead of just sending a long list of fault codes, AI can pinpoint what’s truly urgent.\n“A lot of people talk about predictive maintenance, but some systems just overwhelm customers with data,” Thompson explained.\n“We use AI to filter through the noise and say, ‘This is the real issue, and here’s what needs to be fixed.’”\nAI is also helping technicians in the shop. Penske uses a system called guided repair, which gives technicians step-by-step recommendations.\n“Our technicians get the best training, but even they can use a little help,” Thompson said. “AI helps them hone in on the problem faster and make the right repair the first time.”\nBeyond the Shop: AI’s Role in Fleet Optimization\nAI is also helping fleets operate more efficiently in other ways.\nOne major area is route optimization. AI analyzes data such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, and delivery schedules to suggest the most efficient routes.\n“AI helps fleets plan better,” Thompson said. “It’s about keeping trucks on the road longer and using fuel more efficiently.”\nAnother application is fleet benchmarking. Penske recently launched Catalyst AI, a tool that allows fleets to compare their performance to similar operations.\nIndustry benchmarks, Haynes explained, are static and broad and may not apply to your particular type of operations. So a benchmark that says Class 8 trucks average 6.5 mpg, for instance, might not be realistic if you’re pulling heavy loads in the mountains.\nCatalyst AI analyzes a fleet’s specific operating conditions, location, trip type, terrain, vehicle load, and so on, and compares it to similar fleets.\n“This lets fleet managers see, ‘Am I running better or worse than similar fleets? And what can I do to improve?’” Haynes said.\nAI is Only as Good as the Data You Feed It\nArtificial intelligence relies on huge amounts of data to make predictions and recommendations. But if the data is inaccurate or messy, AI won’t work properly.\n“When you’re building a model using AI, you need clean, accurate data,” Haynes warned. “If your data has errors, the AI will learn the wrong things — and you won’t get reliable results.”\nPenske processes hundreds of millions of messages from trucks every day and runs more than 45,000 checks on that data to make sure it's accurate.\n“We have to make sure we’re filtering out bad data,” Haynes explained.\n“For example, if a GPS signal briefly glitches and shows a truck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, we know that’s wrong. AI has to be trained to ignore that.”\nFor fleet managers looking to get the most out of AI, the key is ensuring their data is accurate and well-organized.\n“It’s the old saying — garbage in, garbage out,” Thompson said. “If you put bad data into an AI system, you’ll get bad results. But when the data is good, AI can be incredibly powerful.”\nInstead of looking at artificial intelligence as something to fear, Thompson and Haynes suggested, look at it as another tool to help you be more successful.\n“As AI continues to improve, it’s going to help fleets run even better,” Haynes said. “But it will always work alongside people, not replace them.”\n“It’s all about making trucking operations smoother and more efficient,” Thompson said. “And at the end of the day, that’s what every fleet manager wants.”",

    "title": "‘The Accidental Influencer’ teaches us that coming-of-age doesn’t end in your 20s",
    "text": "We open in the future home of our protagonist, Red Ho (Shu-Yao Kuo, “Step Back to Glory”), as she tours the place with her boyfriend of three years, Chihming Chou (Ray Chang, “Eternal Summer”). It seems pretty obvious that she’s entering the next chapter of adulthood — home ownership and potentially marriage. It’s only logical that life follows this straightforward trajectory, right?\nAs we’ll see in the next couple of episodes, the answer is very far from a resounding yes. Welcome to the awkward, confusing world of growing up. Our protagonist has lost her way at the ripe old age of 30.\nComing-of-age is a universally\nwell-loved genre that focuses on the protagonist’s transition from childhood into adulthood. The main character is someone young, typically in their teens to their early 20s. The plot generally focuses on a captivating and transformational character arc. Its theme encapsulates a broad and often relatable issue. Rarely, however, do these stories center on anyone 30 or older. After all, it’s common knowledge that life should be worked out by then: your job, your partner, your finances. Why would anybody at that stage experience a major life overhaul?\nRed Ho’s woeful tale begs to differ. Right as she thinks her boyfriend will propose to her as she celebrates her 30th birthday, he breaks up with her in front of her friends — in the new house she is indebted to pay off for the next 20 years of her life. At first, he tells her that he cannot be with someone due to the torment of life stressors and the “demon living inside of him.” This is in addition to both of their busy work lives and Red’s incessant talk about financial calculations for her new position as a property owner in the modern-day economy. As it turns out (rather predictably, might I add), it’s because he was two-timing her. Perhaps those overtime shifts he supposedly reported having were not at the office after all.\nIf this wasn’t bad enough, Red’s job goes up in flames when she finds out that her boss, a freakish marketing director, turns out to be the girl her ex-boyfriend was seeing. In a fit of rage, Red quits. Without a Plan B. At an age where socially she should’ve had everything figured out, she finds herself both single and unemployed. So, she does what any person would’ve done when they hit rock bottom: post on social media. But not just any kind of post — hate posts. Against her ex-boyfriend. Against her ex-boss. Against life. Under the surname “ex-girlfriend from hell,” seeking vengeance on the man who cheated on her. Unexpectedly, she goes viral, rising from 136 followers on Instagram to over 5,000 immediately after a celebrity reposts her.\nSupported by an eccentric trio who serves as her home base and add bits of quirkiness to the dramedy, Red explores the stages after a horrible breakup, difficult conversations with family about still untangling the knots of life and the search to find a new, stable job while navigating internet fame as an upcoming influencer. What was supposedly deemed as a time devoid of upheaval turned out to be a button for a life restart and learning about what life truly was about. There is a stigma associated with this in Asia (where the show is set), but this second wave of adulting during a quarter-life crisis has become much more talked about in the U.S.: A slew of women in their 30s are now documenting their divorce journeys\non TikTok, garnering support and camaraderie of women in similar predicaments throughout the country, some even nicknaming the phenomenon as “The Great Millennial Reset.” Our dear Red doesn’t get the same societal approval as these women do, so the least we can do is give her a couple of silent cheers for braving and (inadvertently) breaking conventional norms in a country that has quite a bit of discreet social rules.\nYes, the distressed, conflicted protagonist feels unsurprising and cliche, and the storyline and characters are a little immature at times, but it reminds us that our inner child doesn’t have to leave forever once ‘adulthood’ is achieved. We can continue to nurture it well into adulthood, because does growth ever really end?\nDaily Arts Contributor Michelle Wu can be reached at michewu@umich.edu.",

    "text": "Prince Harry and [Meghan Markle](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family) were allegedly \"tipped over the edge\" by one incident during Christmas 2019, which helped them realise they had to make their \"own path\". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped down as [working royals](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family) in 2020 and moved to the United States, reports [the Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1849910/prince-harry-meghan-markle-christmas-moment). While there were many reasons that they stepped down, this Christmas incident was the \"final straw\", according to a royal author. In his first book, Finding Freedom, Omid Scobie, alongside Carolyn Durand, wrote about how [Harry and Meghan ](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family)were allegedly furious after they were not included in the late Queen's 2019 Christmas broadcast. During the broadcast, there was not a picture of the couple and their then-newborn son, Prince Archie, alongside the family portraits on the monarch's desk. Before they even announced their departure from the family, the couple believed that the Royal Family and their staff were \"conspiring against them\". According to the authors, the couple felt they \"had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future.\" The book read: \"One didn’t have to look further than the family photos displayed during the Queen’s Speech on Christmas Day. \"In the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen delivered her address, viewers glimpsed photos of the [Waleses] and their children, Charles and Camilla, Prince Philip, and a black-and-white image of George VI. \"Noticeably absent was a photo of Harry, Meghan, and their new baby, Archie. Palace sources insisted that the photos were chosen to represent the direct line of succession, but for Harry and Meghan, it had been yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path.\" However, Prince Harry and Meghan were included in the 2019 Christmas Day speech, when the Queen and Prince Philip met Archie for the first time, and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, was included.

    "title": "TNT Fireworks Public Safety Campaign to Reduce Illegal Fireworks and Promote Safe and Responsible Disposal After Use",
    "text": "/PRNewswire/ -- TNT® Fireworks (TNT), the nation's largest consumer fireworks distributor and best-selling brand, announced a nationwide campaign to promote the safe and responsible use of legal consumer fireworks as Americans celebrate our nation's Independence Holiday season. For many, barbeques and backyard fireworks are a tradition, and when used responsibly and legally, provide safe family fun. To help consumers stay safe and act responsibly, TNT is providing three easy tips for consumers to follow this holiday season when using consumer fireworks: - Stay Legal: Local laws vary widely, from the types of fireworks that are legally permitted - to the times in which they can be used. TNT encourages consumers to know their local laws and to only use fireworks when and where they are legally permitted. Local fire departments and municipal government websites can provide information about what types of fireworks are legal in your community. It's also very important to only purchase fireworks from a licensed retailer! Visit TNTFireworks.com for more information and locations near you. - Be Safe: Be selective when choosing a location for your fireworks show. Pick a dry, flat surface such as concrete, dirt, or pavement that is away from structures and vegetation, and is free of debris. Always read and follow the instructions and have a hose or water source nearby. Consumers should also keep spectators at a safe distance. - Act Responsibly: After the show, let your fireworks cool down for at least twenty minutes and clean up any debris that was generated. After the cooling period, soak each used firework with water before placing them in a waste receptacle, located away from structures. Also, always have a sober adult handle the fireworks. \"This year, we're placing special emphasis on keeping consumers legal and safe,\" said Carson Anderson, president of TNT Fireworks. \"We're reminding consumers to know the law and only use fireworks that are legal in their community and to properly dispose of their used product once the show is over.\" To keep everyone legal, safe and responsible, TNT recommends consumers follow these safety tips: - Never give fireworks to young children. - Have a working hose and/or bucket of water nearby in case of emergencies. - Never carry a firework in your pocket or hold a lit firework in your hand. - Never shoot fireworks from a metal or glass container. - Keep spectators at a safe distance and never aim or throw fireworks at another person. - Never place any part of your body directly over a firework – even when lighting. - Light only one firework at a time. - Stay sober. Never use fireworks with alcohol or drug consumption. - NEVER approach or try to re-ignite a firework that doesn't light the first time.

    "text": "State, city leaders weigh in on Forest Park pool vandalism SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Fallout and questions remain after vandals force Springfield’s Forest Park pool to close down and city leaders said juveniles are to blame. At a time when the city is seeing a rise in crimes committed by teenagers, there are concerns that young people aren’t being held accountable for their actions. The damages to the Forest Park pool are costly to fix, and the impact on the community is serious and Western Mass News spoke with people concerned that young people are to blame for this. Headed to the pool in Forest Park in Springfield on Thursday to cool off with her kids and their friends. Jessica Rogers found it closed and had to soak in the adjacent splashpad instead. “We were very disappointed to be honest, we came on Tuesday and were told the splashpad would be open Thursday and it was tough but the kids adapted,” said Rogers. The pool had opened early due to last week’s heat wave, but multiple acts of vandalism caused by juveniles forced city leaders to shut it down on Wednesday. “When you’re talking about throwing rocks at police officers and slashing their tires and jumping up and down int their cruisers, assaulting their staff,” explained Thomas Ashe. “The latest incident involved having glass thrown broken on the pool deck and thrown into the water.” The pool is now being drained, Springfield Parks and Rec Executive Director Thomas Ashe said it will cost over $12,000 to fix the damage and get it back open. Lifeguards will be moved to new assignments and the idea of opening another pool inside one of the city’s schools is being explored, but when the pool in Forest Park will reopen, remains an unanswered question. “Our hope is for the families and the young people who deserve an oasis like this to have it open but again its going to depend on the actions of others,” expressed Ashe. Western Mass News has learned police are heightening surveillance in the area and taller fences will be installed around the pool. Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi echoes the frustration heard in the community and told us in a statement: “...Some of the young people we’ve encountered are emboldened over a lack of consequences, for their behavior, while some of those people have broken into the park and pool area off-hours and caused damage. Our deputies will continue our patrols in the park, make arrests where appropriate, and ensure forest park remains a safe and pleasant place for families to enjoy.” Meanwhile at the Statehouse, State Representative Carlos Gonzalez said they’re figuring out how to address the spike in young crime. “We’re looking at all laws that are across the country California has a law that holds parents responsible, we also have in maple heights Ohio, its a city ordinance that requires parents to be responsible for any damage when it comes to misdemeanors that youth aren’t involved with,” noted Representative Gonzalez. State Senator Adam Gomez added that we need to make sure resources are available to keep them out of trouble. “Kids just don’t act out for no reason, I think that there’s root causes of the reason,” said Senator Gomez. “We need to figure out different ways that we can engage with out young people and I know that there’s a lot of organizations and also programs.” One resource available: the Springfield Boys and Girls Club on Care Street. We learned they have a full itinerary for all ages this summer that keeps kids coming back everyday and keeps them out of trouble. They even have these passes available to try the club out for free for seven days. Meantime, parents are being called on, to be mindful of their kids whereabouts, and have conversations about respecting property and vandalism. Copyright 2024. Western Mass News (WGGB/WSHM).
