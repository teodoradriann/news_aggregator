    "text": "KERRVILLE, Texas (WSVN) – As the search for survivors in Texas continues, rescue crews from all over the country, including firefighters from Miami-Dade County, have joined forces to do whatever they can in the aftermath of the disastrous floods.\nCrews from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue are on the ground in Texas aiding search-and-rescue efforts near Kerrville.\nThe department deployed a special unit, Task Force One, in response to the catastrophic floods that struck last week.\n“To assist them with recovery and getting back to a sense of normalcy,” said MDFR Battalion Chief Brandon Webb.\nThe team includes two K-9s, two handlers and two managers who were lending a helping hand on Thursday sifting through piles of debris alongside other first responders and humanitarian groups.\nOfficials in Texas said more than 170 people are still unaccounted for, as the death toll continues to rise, with at least 121 people confirmed dead.\nMDFR as well as other crews are beginning to shift their search-and-rescue mission into a recovery effort.\nEarlier in the week , Doral-based Global Empowerment Mission, known as GEM, deployed teams to distribute survival kits and provide assistance.\nTrucks from South Florida were also seen pulling into the area carrying supplies to be given to survivors who have lost everything.\n“Everything here was underwater,” said GEM’s founder, Michael Capponi.\nAs numerous support teams continue their recovery work, Capponi described the heartbreaking scenes along the Guadalupe River.\n“And then all of a sudden, just like that, within 15 minutes, boom, children were gone. We’ve met people that literally had four or five children that are all gone,” said Capponi.\nMDFR’s Task Force 1 is also working with a task force from Nebraska conducting K-9 searches in some of the areas that were hit the hardest by the intense flooding.",

    "title": "Israel admits fault with pair of fatal Gaza strikes",
    "text": "International The Israeli military acknowledged Thursday two deadly strikes on the Maghazi refugee camp on Christmas Eve that killed dozens of Palestinians, noting the attacks killed civilians. The admission comes as the Palestinian death toll exceeds 20,000 in the Israel-Hamas war and pressure rises on Israel to halt its all-out offensive in Gaza. The Israeli military said the Christmas Eve strikes consisted of fighter jet-launched missiles that struck buildings “adjacent” to their intended targets. The military said it “regrets the harm to uninvolved individuals, and is working to draw lessons from the incident.” “A preliminary investigation revealed that additional buildings near the targets were also hit during the strikes, which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians,” the military said. The Gaza Health Ministry said the two strikes killed at least 70 people. International pressure for a cease-fire in the war has continued to rise through the holidays, with Pope Francis re-upping his calls to stop warfare in a Christmas address. “I plead for an end to the military operations with their appalling harvest of innocent civilian victims and call for a solution to the desperate humanitarian situation by an opening to the provision of humanitarian aid. May there be an end to the fueling of violence and hatred,” he said. While the Biden administration has refused calls for a cease-fire from allies abroad and rising dissent domestically, the U.S. government has pressed the Israeli military to draw back its military operations. The Israeli government has shown few signs of heeding that advice, however. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week that the country’s war in Gaza will continue for a “long time,” despite warnings from the U.S. and others that a continued assault on Gaza could strengthen Hamas instead of defeat it.

    "title": "Piden proteger a Urbanismo ante el \"afán prinvatizador\" del Gobierno de Sanz | Andalucía Información. Todas las noticias de Sevilla",
    "text": "El sindicato CCOO ha mantenido este jueves un encuentro con los grupos municipales del PP, PSOE e IU en el Ayuntamiento para abordar la situación de la Gerencia de Urbanismo en el que ha reclamado la \"protección del servicio público\". El sindicato ha trasladado sus \"inquietudes\" sobre las decisiones que el gobierno municipal está tomando en esta área, en especial la externalización de licencias urbanísticas, algo que interpreta que tiene un \"afán privatizador\". Al encuentro han asistido el secretario de Política Institucional de CCOO de Sevilla, Jorge Carlos Lebrón; el secretario de Acción Sindical de CCOO de Sevilla, Sergio Montero, y los delegados de la Sección Sindical de CCOO en la Gerencia de Urbanismo Juan Serrano y Norberto Gómez, respectivamente. Lebrón ha llamado la atención sobre la \"deriva presupuestaria que la Gerencia está sufriendo en los últimos años y que hace que cada vez se ejecute menos presupuesto del previsto\". Igualmente, Lebrón ha asegurado en una nota de prensa que se ha detectado \"un afán privatizador, como el anuncio por parte del gobierno municipal de externalizar las licencias urbanísticas a través de los colegios profesionales, una decisión que, basada en la falsa premisa de que la gestión privada es más eficiente que la pública, llevará aparejada un aumento de los costes, una reducción de la calidad y un empeoramiento de las condiciones laborales\". A juicio de CCOO, éste es \"un hecho muy grave, ya que supone encargar a manos privadas la concesión y el estudio de licencias urbanísticas en la ciudad. Es decir, el control previo al inicio de la ejecución de obras, control de ejecución o de comprobación de las ejecutadas, que siempre han sido funciones realizadas por personal de la Gerencia y que, con este acuerdo, pasan a ser realizadas por personal externo, mientras el Ayuntamiento no cubre las plazas disponibles con personal funcionario, adelgazando así cada vez las funciones de la Gerencia\". Todas estas cuestiones, a juicio de CCOO, \"ponen en peligro el futuro del organismo\" y, al mismo tiempo, \"suponen un claro perjuicio a la ciudanía sevillana, que ve menoscabado su derecho a recibir un servicio público esencial\". En este sentido, Lebrón ha instado a que \"se realicen políticas de urbanismo que sirvan para que la ciudad sea cada vez más inclusiva y accesible en materia de vivienda, sea cual sea la capacidad económica de las personas que deseen acceder a una vivienda\". CCOO también ha puesto el foco en la \"saturación\" de pisos turísticos existente en Sevilla, donde algunas zonas llegan a tener una ocupación del 43%, mientras que otras ciudades han intervenido este mercado cuando sus índices han superado el 8%. \"Una reciente sentencia da el visto bueno a la intervención por parte del gobierno local, al que le pedimos que actúe y que no siga escudándose en esperar una regulación autonómica\", ha apuntado el secretario de Política Institucional de CCOO de Sevilla.

Ассоциация «Cockpit» подвела итоги очередной проверки систем безопасности в немецких аэропортах.\nЧитайте также: Акции немецкого автопрома растут после сделки Трампа в Японии\nА это означает смену приоритетов в авиационной безопасности Германии. И ее ждут многие.\nЛейпциг обошел Мюнхен благодаря освещению и стоп-полосам\nТриумф аэропорта Лейпциг/Галле стал результатом серьезной системной работы над безопасностью. Эксперты отметили образцовые системы освещения воздушной гавани. А еще использование красных мигающих стоп-полос на рулежных дорожках. Именно эти технологии и обеспечили победу Галле.\nVereinigung Cockpit: Leipzig/Halle sicherster deutscher Flughafen\n[https://t.co/NaEYWKUjfm]— airliners.de (@airliners_de)\n[July 23, 2025]\nМюнхен, удерживавший первое место несколько лет подряд, скатился на 2‑е место. Но самый впечатляющий рывок совершил аэропорт Эрфурта — он поднялся сразу на 4‑ю позицию рейтинга. Дрезден, второй саксонский аэропорт в списке, расположился только на 13‑м месте.\nАэропорт Лейпцига — Галле — самый безопасный\nАссоциация «Cockpit» проводит ежегодные проверки безопасности немецких коммерческих аэропортов с 1978 года. С 1996 года в исследование включены также региональные аэропорты — при условии наличия там значительного регулярного авиасообщения.\nМетодология проверки немецких воздушных гаваней постоянно совершенствуется.\nКритерии оценки непрерывно адаптируются к изменяющимся требованиям безопасности полетов. В основе рейтинга — каталог параметров. Он охватывает все системы безопасности аэропортов, которые предотвращают различные авиационные происшествия.\nПилоты требуют больще защиты\nАссоциация «Cockpit» использует результаты проверок не только и не столько для составления рейтингов. Их главная цель — помочь аэропортам улучшить стандарты безопасности на основе профессионального мнения пилотов.\nПо мнению экспертов, немецкие аэропорты могли бы стать еще безопаснее, если бы их взлетно-посадочные полосы получили более надежную защиту.\nКаталог критериев включает оборудование, которое пилоты считают целесообразным и необходимым для оптимальной безопасности. Ежегодная проверка превратилась в важный инструмент повышения авиационной безопасности в Германии.\nЧитайте также:\nПодпишитесь на наш Telegram\nПолучайте по 1 сообщению с главными новостями за день",
