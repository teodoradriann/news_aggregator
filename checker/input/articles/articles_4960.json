    "text": "El Vicario Apostólico de Alepo: «En Siria hay dolor, pero no perdemos la esperanza»\nVatican News\n«Este ataque ha creado graves problemas no sólo desde el punto de vista de la estabilidad social y económica, sino también desde el punto de vista de la fe». El Vicario Apostólico de Alepo, monseñor Hanna Jallouf, en una entrevista a los medios vaticanos, expresó su dolor y preocupación por el atentado terrorista que el domingo pasado en la capital siria, Damasco, que golpeó la iglesia greco-ortodoxa de San Elías, provocando la muerte de más de 20 fieles reunidos en el lugar sagrado para la celebración de la Divina Liturgia. \"Si antes del atentado terrorista solo el 20% de la población pensaba en abandonar el país, ahora el porcentaje ha ascendido al 90%: la gente tiene cada vez más miedo\", admitió el Obispo, quien, sin embargo, también explicó cómo el gobierno sirio le ha asegurado que la situación seguirá mejorando en el futuro. «Las autoridades –detalló– han dicho a todos los cristianos que mantengan la calma porque sus vidas y sus propiedades serán defendidas y protegidas. También garantizaron la posibilidad de poder ejercitar la propia fe con total libertad. “Realmente tenemos una gran esperanza”.\nContra el miedo\nMonseñor Jallouf lanzó entonces un llamamiento a todos los fieles de su vicariato: «No tengan miedo, ciertamente el futuro será mejor que el pasado. Pero lleva tiempo, debemos ser pacientes». Mientras tanto, el ataque del domingo pasado fue reivindicado por la organización extremista sunita «Saraya Ansar al-Sunna». El grupo, en una publicación en redes sociales, amenazó con «nuevos ataques». Según un portavoz del Ministerio del Interior, el autor fue arrestado junto con otros miembros de la organización. También se incautó una gran cantidad de armas y explosivos.\nMás explosiones\nEste miércoles se produjo una gran explosión cerca de una base militar en la costa del distrito de Jabla, provocando una enorme columna de humo. Todavía no está claro si la explosión fue causada por un ataque aéreo o por un dispositivo explosivo colocado dentro de la estructura. También se registraron explosiones violentas en la provincia de Latakia.\nGracias por haber leído este artículo. Si desea mantenerse actualizado, suscríbase al boletín pulsando aquí",

    "text": "Two young chefs from Carmel High School—Julia Hohne, a senior, and Maddie Arroyo, a junior—claimed victory at the 2024 [World Food Championships](https://worldfoodchampionships.com/) (WFC) [Junior Competition](https://worldfoodchampionships.com/news/1279/wfc-junior-competition-returns-to-kitchen-arena-at-the-world-food-championships-in-indianapolis) hosted at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.\n[Ivy Tech Indianapolis](https://www.ivytech.edu/locations/indianapolis/) proudly sponsors [Team Indiana](https://www.teamindianachefs.com/) annually which includes the competition, while [Ivy Tech Community College served as a major sponsor of the WFC as a whole](https://worldfoodchampionships.com/news/1298/ivy-tech-community-college-partners-with-world-food-championships-to-support-culinary-education-at-2024-event-in-indianapolis), solidifying the College’s commitment to culinary excellence and education.\nBoth Hohne and Arroyo are [Ivy Tech dual credit](https://www.ivytech.edu/programs/special-programs-for-students/high-school-programs/dual-credit/) culinary students, and it's a connection that has significantly shaped their culinary journeys. Their success on the stage of the world’s largest food sport competition focused on everyday cooking categories underscores the importance of Ivy Tech’s dual credit programs and just how much the College can help our young culinary talents get a head start in their careers.\nFrom Passion to Plate\nSurprisingly, Hohne and Arroyo had not extensively collaborated before the competition. However, their shared passion for culinary arts and mutual respect for each other's skills and creativity laid a strong foundation for their partnership.\n“Maddie just has such a fun personality, and she’s so artistic. I felt lucky to be working with her,\" Hohne shared. Reflecting on their dynamic, she noted, \"We started by just throwing out our ideas, and we were like, 'Oh, I like that!' We complemented each other and challenged each other in the kitchen, which is the best.”\n“Julia is amazing,” Arroyo noted. “She’s super talented and a natural leader. I learned so much from her.”\nBefore their triumphant performance at the WFC Jr. Competition, Hohne and Arroyo crafted an unforgettable dish during the preliminary round—a visually stunning and flavor-packed poke bowl. This creation showcased not only their technical skills but also their artistic vision, bold culinary instincts, and desire to challenge one another.\nThe bowl was anchored by a bed of purple rice, chosen not only for its striking color but also for its nutty flavor and nutritional value.\n“We steamed it in coconut water, which gave it this subtle, fruity essence and added a lot of health benefits,” Hohne explained.\nAtop the rice sat beet-cured salmon, its vibrant pink hue achieved through careful preparation days in advance. Thinly sliced and meticulously rolled into delicate roses, the salmon brought both elegance and balance to the dish.\nThe judges were captivated not only by the dish’s flavor but also by its intricate presentation, which Arroyo spearheaded. “I love plating. I wanted it to look like a flower bush, so I designed the salmon to look like roses,” Arroyo said.\nTo complement the fish, the duo prepared lightly pickled cucumbers and carrots marinated in agave and sesame—a combination Arroyo described as “one of the most delicious elements of the dish.” A homemade furikake seasoning added depth, while a horseradish wine sauce on the side provided a sharp, tangy contrast.\nFor Hohne and Arroyo, this poke bowl represented more than just a technical challenge—it was an opportunity to test their creativity and step outside the expected.\n“Everyone told us to play it safe and use pork to match the main competition guidelines,” Hohne recalled, “but we wanted to challenge ourselves and do something different. Otherwise, why are we even competing?”\nTheir attention to detail and commitment to pushing boundaries earned them a golden ticket to the main event, setting the stage for their eventual victory.\nTheir winning dish at the WFC Jr. Competition finals, Pork Gorditas, was deeply rooted in Arroyo's Puerto Rican heritage. The recipe, a cherished family tradition, was adapted to meet the competition's \"Healthy Fresh\" theme, which required the use of pork products provided by Indiana Pork.\nArroyo described the process: \"We made a Puerto Rican pork shoulder that captured the moisture and tenderness we wanted using techniques like a sofrito marinade and guajillo chilis.\"\nHohne, who had less experience with Latin flavors, relied on Maddie's expertise to honor the authenticity of the dish. She expressed her commitment, saying, \"It was her grandma's recipe, and it was cherished in her family. I didn't want to mess it up. I wanted to do it justice.\"\nTheir meticulous attention to detail and respect for cultural authenticity resonated with the judges, earning them top honors for Best Teamwork and First Place overall.\nMaddie Arroyo and Julia Hohne's winning pork gorditas.\nWATCH: [Ivy Tech Students Take Second Place at WFC Jr. Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFPgAkVT5hU)\nDual Credit, Big Dreams: How Ivy Tech Fuels Culinary Success\nBoth students attribute a significant part of their success to all the time they’ve spent in the kitchen growing up and the dual credit culinary program at Ivy Tech.\nArroyo’s culinary journey began in her family kitchen, where her father inspired her to experiment with food from a young age.\n“He would make us breakfast, lunch, and dinner, always something fun and creative. I remember having homemade pasta nights using a spindle attachment on our KitchenAid,” Maddie shared. It was this blend of creativity and science that first drew her to the culinary world.\nArroyo’s love for baking, plating, and the technical intricacies of cooking blossomed in high school, particularly when she joined Carmel High School’s culinary program. Her interest in food science solidified after exploring how biology and chemistry intersect with culinary arts. “I love the science behind how food works, and I’ve been drawn to the creative side, especially with plating and visuals,” she explained.\nArroyo, in her first dual credit culinary class, appreciated the comprehensive curriculum, stating, \"It's not just the basics of cooking; it's the in-depth knowledge on bacteria and safety, which I really appreciate.\" Arroyo said.\nNoting the program's efficiency, she said, \"Getting those credits in high school means I'll be able to get my degrees and start working in the industry a lot sooner.\"\nAs a junior, Arroyo plans to deepen her culinary education by continuing Ivy Tech’s dual credit program and participating in future competitions. She dreams of pursuing food science at Purdue University, combining her passion for art, science, and food to carve out a unique career path.\n“This competition gave me the confidence to see that if I want to do something, I can. I just have to push myself toward it,” she said\nFor Hohne, the kitchen has always been a place of discovery and joy. From an early age, she balanced her culinary upbringing between her parents’ vastly different approaches to food.\n“My dad thought ‘from scratch’ meant scratching the box open, while my mom made homemade meals in the crockpot,” Hohne laughed. By fifth grade, Julia had left the box mixes behind, diving into scratch baking and, eventually, culinary competitions.\nA seasoned competitor, Hohne brought valuable experience to the WFC. She previously competed in ProStart, earning third place in the state and advancing to nationals. Her work at Circle City Sweets, a local bakery owned by former Ivy Tech Indianapolis adjunct and Team Indiana baker Cindy Hawkins, has further refined her skills.\n“Working in a professional kitchen taught me time management, how to clean as I go, and how to trust others in a collaborative space,” she noted.\nLooking ahead, Hohne plans to enroll at Ivy Tech Indianapolis to pursue an associate degree in Hospitality Administration, with a focus on baking and pastry. She also aspires to complete the accelerated Business Administration program to complement her culinary pursuits.\n“Ivy Tech has an amazing program. The dual credit classes have allowed me to get ahead and focus on what I love without accumulating debt,” she explained. Julia’s ultimate dream is to immerse herself in international culinary traditions, saving up to spend a year abroad in Italy or France to broaden her expertise – which the money awarded to her from the WFC win will help her achieve!\nBoth Hohne and Arroyo embody a deep passion for food and a clear vision for their future, showcasing how Ivy Tech’s dual credit program provides a powerful springboard for young talent. Their victories at the World Food Championships reflect not only their dedication but also their boundless potential as they step into the next chapters of their culinary careers.\nNEXT: [Team Indiana Compete in the 2023 World Food Championships](https://www.ivytech.edu/about-ivy-tech/news/indianapolis/team-indiana-competes-in-world-food-championships/)\nAbout Ivy Tech Community College\nIvy Tech Community College is Indiana's largest public postsecondary institution and the nation's largest singly accredited statewide community college system, accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Three whales appeared from under the dark and rough waters to say hello. \"We couldn't get into port due to weather conditions, so we were just drifting off the coast,\" he said. \"I just looked out my port hole and there was a whale ... it would have been no more than 10 metres off the starboard side of the ship. \"My friend, who's an officer on the bridge, said 'look off the starboard side' and then I heard [the crew] get all excited. \"So I raced up there and then they gave us a show for about 15 minutes, just going back and forth.\" He said one of the three whales even rolled over. \"And looked like it was getting a nice mouth full of maybe krill,\" Mr Williams said. Mr Williams, who has been a seafarer for 14 years, said his current vessel's run can get slightly repetitive, but it's moments like these that \"keeps it fresh\". \"You see things like that and it just tops it off,\" he said. \"Everyone was chuffed to see them, we're all up on the bridge having a gander, and everyone's recording.\" The dad of two just made the sea change from Victoria to Shearwater.
