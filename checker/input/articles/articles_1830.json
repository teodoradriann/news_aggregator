    "text": "With more rain coming, searchers in race to find missing Ladysmith flood victims Search and rescue members will resume their search on Friday morning for five people who remain unaccounted for following a flash flood on Christmas Eve. JOHANNESBURG - It’s a race against the clock for rescue teams searching for missing flood victims in Ladysmith, as more rain is predicted for KwaZulu-Natal. Search and rescue members will resume their search on Friday morning for five people who remain unaccounted for following a flash flood on Christmas Eve. The death toll following the floods stands at eleven. The South African Weather Service says KwaZulu-Natal, and specifically Ladysmith, should brace itself for more rain today going into the weekend. Weather forecaster Ishmael Moyo: \"KZN at the moment has a 30% chance of showers and thundershowers and that is, of course, inclusive of the Ladysmith area. And then going into Saturday, we expect the weather system to shift eastward, pushing some thunderstorms into the KZN area.\" Moyo said there is a 60% chance of rain for on-and-off thundershowers in Ladysmith on Saturday and Sunday. \"There’s also still the possibility of severe thunderstorms with heavy downpours for Saturday and Sunday and that is the only main concern for this weather system we are experiencing.\" Search and rescue personnel have made good headway in recovering the bodies of those missing over the past two days but with more inclement weather forecast for Ladysmith, that could all change.",

    "title": "Sound On Tape Releases Existencial Debut Album, Price",
    "text": "Listen to a great contemporary album. This one’s sounding mint.\nThe world of Dance music is huge. So great, in fact, that it can harbour endless genres and subgenres, many being born from combining two pre-existing genres, were they inside or outside the Dance spectrum itself. This time, we welcome an artist who’s blending the best of the Black community genres into Dance. Meet Sound On Tape .\nHailing from Cleveland, Ohio, enigmatic producer Sound On Tape comes to the scene with the premise (and promise) of crafting emotive electronic dance music . In a world where numbers come first and feels second, he’s using his own productions as a vehicle to express stories, feelings and even essays first.\nInfluenced by genre pioneers El-B, Burial, Mr. Fingers, Kraftwerk, and Sticky, as well as Jazz greats Bill Evans and John Coltrane, his approach to music is highly melodic, and cleverly rooted in pianos, uncommon progressions, and true journeys through sound. His debut long play , Price , is more than a case in point.\nPrice Sound On Tape’s first-ever artist album Price is grounded in the analogue, the physical, and the flawed, arguably stuff we’ve dearly missed lately in the industry. Under the belief that texture is in itself an instrument, he daringly pairs classical Jazz with modern synthesisers and electronic beats. These instruments, alongside tons of pleasant piano, serve as paint to his UK Garage canvas in this release.\nTinting the music with direction and purpose, Price is a very personal way for Marcus to talk about a rarely recognised change: that Black people, once treated as goods, are now consumers. And through intricately woven titles and spoken narrative throughout the album, complex concepts such as Hush Harbors — secret places where enslaved people would meet to practice faith — and more, the piece asks the question: as faith becomes less central in Black communities, where do we find a safe place today? Can music be a modern-day Hush Harbor?\nWith Price I kept authenticity in mind in every aspect. The sound field recordings you hear are authentically Cleveland, the subject matter is authentic to my Black experience, and the narration is an authentic conversation: they’re not skits. I’d finish a song then Sted would come over and we’d crack a bottle of champagne and just discuss the Black experience in America. That’s what you’re hearing on the album in real time. Musically it goes beyond the genre confines of Garage with touches of Jazz, RnB, and House. I’m proud to present a concept album in a genre that today is dominated by singles.\n-Sound On Tape Across eleven very varied tracks, you’ll find Marcus’ message developing in every sonic corner. From the upbeat, House-influenced sounds of ‘ If You’re Free (Say So) ‘ to the detailed production on ‘ Gods Don’t Die ‘, the two-step beat of ‘ Hush Harbors ‘, and Marcus’s own take on classic tracks ‘ Gabriel ‘ and ‘ Inner City Life ‘, Price aims to evolve the sounds of yesteryear into a modern genre, renovating energies and audiences while doing something intrinsically unique.\nWriter’s Picks ‘ You And One Other ‘ really stuck with me, and it’s easily my favourite track in the album. It hugged me, and it wrapped its friendly arms around me. It’s the warmth of the trumpets, the way it’s mixed with the lovely chord accentuated with these soft, almost Lofi-borrowed pianos, the long-tailed tonal one-hits.\nI just don’t know how to explain it — as often happens with my favourite songs from albums — it just happens. This song really blew me away. It’s like the auditory analogue to watching a sunset from 60 years ago; that’s what my mind sees with it. I know I’ve got some degree of pareidolia, but until now, I didn’t know I had some sort of synaesthesia in me too!\nSound On Tape — Price Tracklist Inner City Life featuring Kyle Kidd If You’re Free (Say So) featuring Lady Bri Gods Don’t Die featuring Kyle Kidd The Buyer Is The Product Price featuring Sierra Delaine Hush Harbors You And One Other Pro Nigga Burnin’ Out featuring Sierra Delaine Gabriel featuring Debra’s Piano Final Thoughts And you’re telling me this is Marcus’ FIRST album? It only goes to show how mature his sound is, but also how grounded and determined his mind and soul are, to come up with something so powerful both to the ears and to the brain. We’re excited to see what’s up next in Sound On Tape’s history, which can only be pure bliss, quite like this album.\nListen to Sound On Tape ‘s brand-new LP, Price , by hitting the ‘ Play ‘ button on the Spotify player below.

    "text": "DOHA: Jackson Irvine scored the only goal as Australia ground out a 1-0 victory over Syria at Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Group B on Thursday to all but confirm their place in the knockout rounds of the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023.\nIrvine’s 59th-minute goal, his second of the tournament so far, saw Graham Arnold’s side back up their opening win over India with another three points to sit on top of the standings with one round remaining.\nThe top two teams in each group advancewith the four third-placed sides with the best records also progressing and, with India due to face Uzbekistan later in the day, Australia’s hopes of going through have been significantly enhanced.\nIrvine’s close-range finish tipped the scales in Australia’s favour almost an hour into a game of limited scoring opportunities, even after the Syrians had given the Socceroos an early fright.\nIbrahim Hesar received possession inside the penalty area and, as he held off the attention of Harry Souttar, rolled the ball for Pablo Sabbag to send a low left foot shot that beat Maty Ryan, only to rattle the base of the post and bounce to safety.\nJordan Bos, starting after a substitute appearance in the 2-0 win over India, then pulled his shot wide from the edge of the area as the Australians were increasingly gifted possession by the Syrians, but struggled to make the most of their opportunities.\nIrvine drove a header over the bar after a Connor Metcalfe free-kick that was floated in the direction of Souttar, only for the ball to sail over the head of the Leicester City defender and leave Irvine to miss the target.\nIrvine threatened again with 10 minutes left in the half, fractionally mistiming his run at the far post and just failing to make contact as Gethin Jones flicked Martin Boyle’s corner across the face of goal.\nSyrian attacks were rare in the first half but when Hector Cuper’s side ventured forward Australia were opened up, with Amar Ramadan pulling his shot into the side netting with six minutes left in the half. Sabbag shot over from 20 yards a minute before the interval.\nBoyle’s persistence finally delivered the opener 14 minutes into the second half as the Hibernian winger slipped past Ramadan before finding Irvine and, after turning in the box, the midfielder poked his shot under Ahmad Madanieh to score.\nRyan then survived a scare as the game entered the final quarter, almost spilling Mouaiad Al Ajaan’s looping 30-yard strike over his own line before scrambling to keep the ball out and ensure Australia completed back-to-back wins.\nAustralia close out their group campaign against Uzbekistan on Tuesday while Syria will have to defeat India to stand a chance of advancing.\n Copy 18/01/2024 15",

    "text": "Les services d’urgence ont été alertés dimanche matin, vers 2h30, lors d’un appel au 911 concernant le déclenchement d’une alarme d’incendie. Les pompiers étaient déjà sur place, à l’intersection des rues Notre−Dame et Saint−Sulpice, à l’arrivée des policiers. «Selon les premières informations, un ou des suspects auraient mis le feu à un échafaudage sur un chantier de construction de l’édifice. Les pompiers ont trouvé des traces d’accélérant», a indiqué l’agente Caroline Chèvrefils, porte−parole du Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM). «Il n’y a aucun dommage au bâtiment», a−t−elle précisé. Personne n’a été arrêté et l’enquête a été transférée à la section qui chapeaute les enquêtes sur les incendies criminels au SPVM. Lieu historique La basilique Notre−Dame de Montréal est classifiée comme étant un lieu historique national du Canada. Sa construction remonte aux années 1820. Elle fait l’objet de travaux de restauration depuis 2020. L’endroit est très prisé des touristes. L’église fut élevée au rang de basilique mineure en 1982 par le pape Jean−Paul II, qui l’a visitée en septembre 1984. «À maintes occasions, des milliers de personnes se sont rassemblées à l’intérieur ou sur son parvis pour rendre un dernier hommage à des personnalités importantes; pensons à Maurice Richard ou Pierre Trudeau en 2000. Elle connut aussi des heures plus joyeuses et somptueuses avec le mariage de Céline Dion et René Angélil ou celui, un peu plus discret, du hockeyeur Mario Lemieux», mentionne notamment sa fiche dans le répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec.",

    "title": "Winds of Change: Iran’s New Reformist President and the Path Ahead",
    "text": "The election of a new reformist president in Iran has sparked significant interest both domestically and internationally. This shift in leadership comes at a critical juncture for the Islamic Republic, presenting opportunities and challenges as the nation navigates its future. The following article critically assesses the potential impacts of this new presidency on Iran’s political, economic, and social landscape, as well as its foreign relations.\nThe Reformist Movement in Iran\nThe reformist movement in Iran has its roots in the late 1990s, marked by the presidency of Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005). Reformists advocate for greater political freedoms, economic modernization, and improved relations with the international community, contrasting with the conservative elements that dominate Iranian politics. The new reformist president, whose campaign emphasized these values, represents a renewed push toward reform in a country that has experienced significant political and economic turbulence in recent years.\nPolitical Implications\nThe election of a reformist president could lead to substantive changes in Iran’s political landscape. Reformists typically advocate for greater political openness and civil liberties. This could mean a loosening of restrictions on freedom of speech, press, and assembly, fostering a more open and participatory political environment. Such changes would be significant in a country where political dissent is often met with severe repercussions.\nHowever, the reformist president will face substantial opposition from conservative factions entrenched in powerful institutions such as the Guardian Council, the Revolutionary Guards, and the Supreme Leader’s office. These entities have historically resisted reforms that could dilute their control. The president’s ability to implement meaningful political changes will depend on navigating this complex power structure and building coalitions within a fragmented political landscape.\nMoreover, any attempt at significant reform will likely provoke a reaction from hardliners who fear losing their grip on power. This could lead to increased political tension and instability. The president will need to strike a delicate balance between pushing for reforms and maintaining enough support to govern effectively.\nEconomic Prospects\nEconomically, the new president faces a daunting challenge. Iran’s economy has been crippled by a combination of domestic mismanagement and international sanctions, particularly those re-imposed by the United States following its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018. High inflation, unemployment, and a declining standard of living have created widespread discontent among the Iranian populace.\nA reformist president is likely to prioritize economic reforms aimed at addressing these issues. This could include measures to combat corruption, increase transparency, and modernize Iran’s economic infrastructure. Additionally, the president may seek to re-engage with international economic institutions and attract foreign investment to revitalize the economy.\nCentral to this economic agenda will be the president’s approach to the JCPOA. A reformist administration is expected to pursue diplomatic efforts to revive the nuclear deal, as lifting sanctions would provide a much-needed boost to the economy. Successful negotiations could lead to the unfreezing of Iranian assets abroad, increased oil exports, and a more stable economic environment. However, achieving this will require deft diplomacy and willingness to make concessions, which could be politically contentious within Iran.\nSocial Reforms\nSocially, the new president’s reformist agenda may focus on improving human rights and expanding individual freedoms. Iran has a young and increasingly educated population that is frustrated with social restrictions and economic hardships. Addressing their concerns could involve easing restrictions on cultural and social activities, enhancing gender equality, and improving educational and employment opportunities.\nOne area of particular importance is women’s rights. Despite significant progress in education and workforce participation, Iranian women still face substantial legal and social discrimination. A reformist president might push for legal reforms to enhance women’s rights, though this will undoubtedly face resistance from conservative elements.\nAnother critical social issue is the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities. Iran’s diverse population includes numerous ethnic groups and religious minorities, many of whom feel marginalized by the state. Promoting greater inclusivity and protecting minority rights could help to alleviate some of these grievances and promote national unity.\nForeign Relations\nOn the international stage, the election of a reformist president could lead to a shift in Iran’s foreign policy. Reformists generally favor improved relations with the West and regional neighbors. The president is likely to pursue a more conciliatory and cooperative approach to diplomacy, seeking to reduce tensions and resolve conflicts through negotiation rather than confrontation.\nRe-engaging with the JCPOA and improving relations with the United States and European countries will be a priority. This could pave the way for lifting economic sanctions, normalizing trade relations, and attracting foreign investment. However, achieving these goals will require overcoming significant mistrust and skepticism, particularly in the U.S. political establishment.\nIn the Middle East, the president may seek to de-escalate conflicts and build more stable and constructive relationships with neighboring countries. Iran’s involvement in regional conflicts, such as in Syria and Yemen, has been a source of significant international criticism and economic strain. A more moderate foreign policy could help to reduce these pressures and enhance Iran’s standing in the region.\nChallenges and Limitations\nDespite the potential for positive change, the new reformist president will face numerous challenges. The entrenched power of conservative factions, economic hardships, and geopolitical tensions all pose significant obstacles to the reformist agenda. Additionally, the president must contend with a public that is both hopeful for change and skeptical of political promises, given past disappointments.\nOne major challenge will be managing the expectations of the Iranian people. The desire for rapid and substantive change is strong, but the president will need to temper these expectations with the reality of Iran’s complex political and economic landscape. Incremental progress may be more achievable than sweeping reforms, but this could lead to frustration and disillusionment among the populace.\nThe president will also need to navigate the delicate balance between pursuing reforms and maintaining stability. Pushing too hard for change could provoke a backlash from conservative forces, leading to political instability or even violence. Conversely, failing to deliver on promised reforms could erode the president’s support base and weaken the administration’s legitimacy.\nThe election of a new reformist president in Iran presents both opportunities and challenges. The potential for political, economic, and social reforms offers hope for a more open, prosperous, and inclusive Iran. However, achieving these goals will require navigating a complex and often hostile political environment, addressing deep-seated economic issues, and managing geopolitical tensions.\nThe president’s success will depend on a combination of effective leadership, strategic diplomacy, and the ability to build broad-based support for the reformist agenda. While the road ahead is fraught with difficulties, the possibility of meaningful change offers a glimmer of hope for a better future for Iran and its people.",

Point de visite du parc, il fut hors de question de soumettre les visiteurs au moindre risque sous les majestueux arbres centenaires. Toutefois l’expérience gourmande s’imposait. Les visiteurs étaient invités à se replier dans les salles de la forteresse et à déguste les vins de la propriété. Dans la cour d’honneur seuls quelques téméraires artisans passionnés (forgeron, apiculteur, pépiniériste…) affrontaient les impondérables météorologiques et illustraient leur opiniâtreté pour la transmission de leur savoir-faire. À l’heure du déjeuner \"le banquet\" concocté par l’incontournable chef cuisinier Simeon Goodman affichait complet et satisfaisait pleinement les convives. Malgré la pluie et les caprices d’Éole, il régnait parmi les visiteurs une atmosphère insouciante et décontractée ; une fois de plus les féeries de Noël semaient joie et bonne humeur.",
