    "text": "Accusa un malore sul Monte Alto, muore un uomo di 62 anni\nUn uomo di 62 anni di Sarnico è morto nel tardo pomeriggio sul Monte Alto tra Capriolo e Adro, non molto distante dalla località Stallone, a causa di un malore. L’uomo, a quanto risulta dalle prime informazioni, sarebbe stato soccorso da una persona, la stessa che ha lanciato immediatamente l’allarme. Per raggiungere il posto in cui il 62enne ha accusato il malore non è stato per nulla semplice, per questo si è reso necessario l’intervento dei Vigili del fuoco di Palazzolo e soprattutto del personale dell’elisoccorso decollato da Bergamo. Ma per l’uomo purtroppo non c’è stato nulla da fare.\nRiproduzione riservata © Giornale di Brescia\nIscriviti al canale WhatsApp del GdB e resta aggiornato\n@News in 5 minuti\nA sera il riassunto della giornata: i fatti principali, le novità per restare aggiornati.",

    "text": "These are the best winter destinations in New Jersey Now that the holiday season is winding down, it’s time to get off the BarcaLounger and get out. With that said, here are two great places to go this winter. [24/7 Tempo](https://247tempo.com/best-winter-destination-in-every-state/) recently put out a list of the best winter destinations in every state. They did some comprehensive research calling on resources like U.S. News & World Report, National Geographic, Conde Nest Traveler, USA Today and Reader's Digest to name just a few. The results of their research came up with Lambertville as the best winter destination here in New Jersey. The researchers picked Lambertville for their quaint town-like atmosphere with great restaurants and stores. I always like Lambertville in the winter as it reminds me of a scene in a Dickens novel. They do have great restaurants and it’s easy to navigate through the town to shop and be entertained. It’s definitely a great place to go, especially with the family. A nice afternoon on a weekend can be spent in Lambertville. I agree with the researcher’s findings although I have another New Jersey destination that I like to go to in the winter. That’s Cape May. You can get out and enjoy one of the best winter destinations on the East Coast, beautiful Cape May. This year Cape May and its winter activities are almost at full strength and they are definitely worth the trip as they have a full menu of things to do for the family and romantic getaways. I’ve been down to Cape May in the winter many times and I thoroughly enjoyed it. They literally turned the most iconic seashore destination in America into a Currier & Ives holiday card or lithograph. Cape May makes a great effort to promote winter activities and The Congress Hotel, one of my favorites is a great place to stay, which is nice to see from a “summer destination” If you’re not into traveling and want to stay local enjoy these winter destinations right here in New Jersey.

    "text": "Simply Wall St. Why Ever Glory United Holdings Limited (Catalist:ZKX) Looks Like A Quality Company Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) April 12, 2024 at 1:35 AM · 3 min read\nOne of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Ever Glory United Holdings Limited ( Catalist:ZKX ).\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nView our latest analysis for Ever Glory United Holdings\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ever Glory United Holdings is:\n61% = S$6.8m ÷ S$11m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each SGD1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made SGD0.61 in profit.\nDoes Ever Glory United Holdings Have A Good ROE? Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Ever Glory United Holdings has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Construction industry .\nroe That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for Ever Glory United Holdings by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity? Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nStory continues Combining Ever Glory United Holdings' Debt And Its 61% Return On Equity Although Ever Glory United Holdings does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.11 is still low. Its ROE is very impressive, and given only modest debt, this suggests the business is high quality. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.\nConclusion Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. Check the past profit growth by Ever Glory United Holdings by looking at this visualization of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .\nBut note: Ever Glory United Holdings may not be the best stock to buy . So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

    "title": "Florida Electric co-ops offer collective assurance that power will come back to Big Bend",
    "text": "The Florida Electric Cooperatives Association ( FECA ) says thousands of power workers remain at work to restore electricity in North Florida.\n“The herculean effort being made by our lineworkers to restore power to co-op consumer-members in North Florida is unprecedented,” reads a statement from the FECA. “Our teams are joined by approximately 4,900 additional lineworkers and tree and debris removal personnel working shifts around the clock to get power restored. This work began as soon as the storm passed, and will not end until every consumer-member has electric service.”\nHelene made landfall last Thursday in Perry as a Category 4 hurricane, initially knocking out power for more than a million Florida customers . A week later, most have seen power restored, but Big Bend counties that took a direct hit still have thousands without service . As of 9 a.m., nearly 9,000 Florida customers still had power out, according to the Public Service Commission .\nAs it happens, that area remains chiefly served by co-ops. Tri-County Electric Cooperative reports 2,600 without power in Taylor County and 2,400 out in Madison County, with those two counties housing more than half those still impacted by electrical outages. The utility also has 362 customers awaiting service in Jefferson County, 135 in Dixie County and 46 in Lafayette County.\nCentral Florida Electric Cooperative reports 1,400 Dixie County customers and 1,300 Levy County customers need power restored. Additionally, 654 Suwannee Valley Electric Cooperative customers in Hamilton County are still without power.\n“Restoring electricity for each and every consumer-member as safely and quickly as possible is our sole focus,” the FECO statement reads. “We understand that one day without power is an incredible burden. That is why we are grateful for the tremendous support of Governor ( Ron ) DeSantis and his Administration during every step of this restoration as we continue working to reconnect every consumer-member in our rural and suburban communities.”\nThe statement alludes to the fact the region also suffered through Hurricane Idalia last year and other storms in the recent past.\n“Helene was historically devastating for the region, leaving many suggesting the area may be Florida’s newest Hurricane Alley,” the FECO statement continues.\n“Given the historic damage, the recovery efforts have moved much more quickly than our capabilities may have allowed just a few years ago. Because co-ops have invested tremendously in storm preparation, strategic organization and technology, they are able to bring thousands of skilled workers and necessary equipment in advance of an anticipated event, cutting restoration wait times by days, and in some cases, weeks.”\nThe statement also noted other parts of the country still addressing the consequences of the storm.\n“Our hearts go out to all who have been impacted by this catastrophic storm, and applaud similar, incredible efforts being implemented across our state, and in Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and others requiring a massive draw of skilled personnel,” the statement reads.",

El Gobierno, para facilitar la actuación militar, ha designado a estas bandas como grupos terroristas.\nEstas mafias también han mostrado un especial interés en el robo de combustible, en particular el procesado en las zonas ricas en petróleo. En este sentido, el general Buba ha confirmado que las fuerzas nigerianas han recuperado 100,3 millones de litros a lo largo del año, de acuerdo con el balance recogido por el 'Premium Times'.\nA pesar de estos resultados, el general ha avisado que la situación de seguridad a lo largo de este año ha permanecido \"fluida, compleja y dinámica\" por la violencia diseminada a lo largo y ancho de Nigeria.\n\"La naturaleza impredecible de la amenaza a la que nos enfrentamos representa todavía un importante desafío para las fuerzas de seguridad. En consecuencia, hace falta que evolucionemos nuestras tácticas para responder a ella\", ha declarado.\n- item no encontrado",

    "text": "I got introduced to the concept of todo lists early in my career. The idea sounded simple and interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I started putting everything on my mind into a to-do list. It worked well initially. After all, I had only a few responsibilities. So, putting them on a piece of paper and marking each one as I progressed didn’t require much planning and effort. I would glance at the list at the beginning of each day and tackle each task one by one. Todo lists worked like a magic formula—writing tasks down ensured I didn’t miss anything, knowing I had it all in one place led to less stress and anxiety, and the best part was the feeling of satisfaction from seeing those tick marks on my todo list which I believe kept me happy and motivated. As I grew in my career, five tasks on my to-do list turned into 20, 30, 40…and so on. Different types of responsibilities with different expectations, both at work and at home, were overwhelming. So, I kept adding everything to my to-do list, and before I knew it, it was crammed with more things than I could accomplish. A long list of things to do made it harder to pick something meaningful and valuable and get started on it. I would stare at the endless list, pick tasks at random, and try to do as much as I could during the day. But in spite of working long hours, I felt defeated at the end of the day—my work was less impactful and more exhausting, and I still had a ton of things on my to-do list that kept crying for my attention. Not accomplishing as much as I expected to was demotivating at first. But I wasn’t ready to give up. I knew the problem wasn’t my to-do list but my process. So I decided to try a bunch of different strategies—some worked, others didn’t. Here are the five practices to put your to-do list to best use based on my experience. Long hours spent checking off a to-do list and ending the day with a full trash can and a clean desk are not virtuous and have nothing to do with success. Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results. To-do lists tend to be long; success lists are short. One pulls you in all directions; the other aims you in a specific direction. One is a disorganized directory and the other is an organized directive. If a list isn’t built around success, then that’s not where it takes you. If your to-do list contains everything, then it’s probably taking you everywhere but where you really want to go. — Gary Keller, The One Thing 5 steps to make the most of your todo list Keep a written todo list Big or small, it’s impossible to remember everything you need to do. When you don’t actually write things down, it’s hard to prioritize complex, long-term, forward-looking tasks over easy, short-term, time-wasting activities. Not writing things down has another problem. Keeping track of all the unfinished tasks puts an unnecessary burden on the brain. Your brain cycles that are better spent in completing a task are wasted in holding a mental list of all the things you need to do. What makes it even worse is the Zeigarnik effect—thoughts of unfinished tasks keep popping up in your head right when you get down to work or are trying hard to focus. These intrusive thoughts that take away your attention even for a split second make it hard to concentrate and get any meaningful work done. Distractions from incomplete work prevent you from entering into a state of flow—which is when you are completely immersed in a task and the time seems to stand still. Flow minimizes distractions, prevents procrastination, and leads to high performance and productivity. Letting your brain continually remind you that you haven’t done something is actually quite unpleasant, and it can even lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout. The simple act of writing things down makes your brain more effective—fewer things on the mind frees up your brain to do more productive work. But dumping everything from your mind to the list is just a start. Simply writing everything down won’t help you stay productive. To make the most of this to-do list, you need to turn it from a bunch of meaningless line items to a more meaningful action-oriented list. Creating a to-do list does not mean you have to tick every single item on it. You need to declutter and organize it in a way that makes it easy to spot and get started on more impactful work. Your task list isn’t a tool for getting everything done. Rather, it’s a tool that will ensure you get the right things done. It’s important to understand the difference. — Damon Zahariades, To-Do List Formula Organize your todo list. A big to-do list may seem scary at first. But once you organize it well, it eases the process of deciding what to do each day, which tasks to schedule into the future, and how to achieve more by getting work done through others. To do this, divide your todo list into four groups: Urgent tasks that immediately deserve your attention. These could be important tasks that you’ve put off for too long and have now turned into urgent or unplanned issues, discussions, or meetings that demand your time and effort. Group 1: Important tasks that you refuse to prioritize because they’re either complex don’t have a specific due date, or their deadline is far into the future. These are often tasks that involve long-term thinking, planning, and future-oriented work. Group 2: Tasks that you don’t need to do yourself and can be delegated to others. It’s hard to delegate when you expect 100% perfection or want others to do things just the way you do. If someone can meet 70-80% of your expectations, delegate and consider it as a task well done. Group 3: Activities that make you feel good once done but actually don’t bring any value or tasks that have been sitting on your to-do list for a long time that you’ll probably never get done. These are time-wasting, unproductive units of work that feel small at the moment but add up to a significant amount of lost time and effort. Group 4: A useful practice when doing this activity is to color code tasks—use a different color for each group. One look at the to-do list, and you’ll get a snapshot of how your tasks are spread—do you have a long list of inconsequential activities? Is a large part of your to-do list focused on important future-looking activities or reacting to the urgent? Are you saving time by delegating enough, or are you too afraid to let go? With your to-do list organized, it’s now ready for some action. Make it actionable The hard part is over. You have a well-organized to-do list, which makes it easy to plan and prioritize. A to-do list is not only meant to decide today’s tasks but also to schedule what you need to do in the future. To act on your todo list, go through each group created in the step above and do this: Strike off everything in group 4. Beam with pride, for you just saved yourself a tremendous amount of time. Let's put all that saved time to good use. Delegate everything in group 3. Allocate a small amount of time for coordination and follow-ups. Just because you’re not doing it yourself does not mean this work will take you zero time. Order tasks in group 2 by importance and interest. Take the top 5 tasks with the highest score on the importance and interest scale and mark them for you to tackle first. If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first. This is another way of saying that if you have two important tasks before you, start with the biggest, hardest, and most important task first. — Brian Tracy, Eat That Frog Order tasks in group 1 by urgency and mark the top 2-5 tasks for you to work on today based on their complexity and effort required. A clear list of action items is good to get started, but it’s not enough to ensure you make the best use of your time and get things done. Unless you create a specific plan detailing when and where you are going to initiate the desired behavior, you may miss multiple opportunities presented during the day when you could make progress on these tasks. The next step minimizes lost opportunities and enables you to get more work done. Put it on your calendar Take a look at your calendar for tomorrow, next week, and next month. Is your calendar packed with meetings? Which ones are useful, and which ones can be discarded? Do you have tasks on your calendar from group 4 that are no longer needed? Which slots on your calendar are filled with activities that can be delegated to others? Spot them on your calendar and remove, reassign or reschedule to create space for activities from group 1 and group 2. If you’re not in the habit of using a calendar to schedule and plan your tasks, don’t worry. You can get started now. Scheduling tasks in advance makes it easy to get started, as you no longer have to decide what to do next or wait for the inspiration to strike. You can initiate the intended response by simply acting on your plan. Planning ahead and time-boxing your tasks by putting them on your calendar has some major advantages: You don’t have to decide at the last moment, which often leads to indecision and waste of time. You can plan and prioritize important work over easy or urgent tasks. Gives you a sense of control over your time. Keeps you calm and focused as it prevents you from panicking on not knowing what to do next. More brain cycles are available to focus on the task at hand. You’re less likely to waste all your time in meetings by blocking important work upfront. Gives you an opportunity to do work that you have been procrastinating and putting off for a long time. You can also use a calendar to block time for repetitive tasks, checking emails, responding to messages, etc. Once your mind tunes to using specific time blocks for these activities, you’re less likely to be distracted by them during your most productive hours. You must create a foundational schedule that adds structure and intentionality to your days and weeks. A foundational schedule is a pre-determined, recurring schedule that is made up of focused time blocks dedicated to your highest priority activities. — Hal Elrod, The Miracle Morning for Entrepreneurs Check off your completed tasks. You have done the work. You have finished the task. Now to the most important part. Don’t forget to tick the item off your to-do list. There’s a certain sense of satisfaction and pleasure in marking a task done. Checking off tasks releases dopamine in our brains, which not only makes us happy but also makes the task more pleasurable next time around. You can benefit from ticking the completed items in more than one way. Spend 15 mins weekly and monthly looking at the finished tasks. Are you spending your time effectively? What do you need to start doing? What can you eliminate? What more can you delegate? How can you prioritize more forward-looking activities? How can you reduce time spent on urgent, time-sensitive tasks? Effectively managing your to-do list isn’t a one-time process. It requires the mindset to consistently learn and improve. Don’t rush through your to-do list. Invest time in making it work for you. People don’t take anything seriously until it’s written down and becomes an actual part of their daily schedule. It might take you some time to get there but once that becomes a habit, you’ll end up getting all that you planned done simply because it’s part of your to-do list for the day. — Jim Kwik Summary Writing everything you need to do in a to-do list is a good start. It ensures you don’t miss anything while freeing your brain to focus on the task at hand. A to-do list without a sense of importance and urgency is of no use. Divide your to-do list into different groups to easily separate impactful work from inconsequential activities. Declutter and eliminate delegates, then pick a few urgent and important tasks to get started. Don’t leave things you need to do to change. Schedule all activities on the calendar to ensure they get done at the right time. Tick the item on the todo list once complete. It will leave you feeling happy and satisfied. Also published . here",
