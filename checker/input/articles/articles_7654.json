    "text": "Mayara: Marrakech Forum offers an opportunity to serve security and stability across the globe Hespress EN Thursday 11 July 2024 - 18:48 The second edition of the Marrakech Parliamentary Economic Forum, to be held on July 11 and 12, 2024 under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI, bringing together parliamentarians and economic players from the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions, opened this Thursday in the Ochre city.\nThe event, organized by the Chamber of Councillors and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (APM), aims to strengthen economic and political cooperation between participating countries, with a particular focus on two key themes: the transition to green energy and support for entrepreneurship.\nWarnings from the President of the House of Councillors, Enaam Mayara\nThe opening of the Forum was marked by speeches from a number of eminent figures. These included the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (APM) and the President of the Chamber of Councillors, Enaam Mayara, as well as Rachid Talbi El Alami, President of the Chamber of Representatives. Representatives of legislative institutions and parliamentary groups from Africa, the Arab world, Central, South and Latin America also took the floor.\nEnaam Mayara, President of the House of Councillors, opened the forum by warning of the international uncertainties exacerbated by crises such as the war in Gaza. He highlighted the devastating impact of this conflict on civilians and infrastructure, criticizing the fragility of the global food security system, the volatility of financial markets, and energy and inflationary crises. Enaam Mayara deplored the bleak picture of a world marked by economic and political uncertainty.\nMorocco’s role in regional cooperation\nThe forum also reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to promoting regional cooperation and sustainable development, while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of economic integration in the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions. Enaam Mayara highlighted Morocco’s efforts, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, to invest in sustainable solutions and promote renewable energies. The country has established a legislative and institutional framework favorable to private investment in this sector, thus becoming a regional leader in energy transition.\nThe President of the House of Councillors spoke of the Sovereign’s Atlantic initiative, aimed at improving access to the Atlantic Ocean for Sahelian countries, and the Morocco-Nigeria gas pipeline project. These initiatives illustrate Morocco’s strategy to create spaces for development and regional cooperation, based on the win-win principle.\nThe forum also saw the launch of the Global South Parliamentary Observatory for Sustainable Development, in partnership with the Mediterranean Parliament. This observatory aims to strengthen South-South cooperation and propose concrete solutions to sustainable development challenges.\nEmphasis on women’s participation\nThe event also highlights the importance of women’s participation in decision-making processes, with the presentation of the activities of the Forum of Women Parliamentarians of the Mediterranean Parliament and the signing of cooperation agreements with women’s parliamentary networks in Africa and the Arab world. It also reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to promoting regional cooperation and sustainable development, while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of economic integration in the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions.\nThat said, the Forum, whose first session was held in December 2022 in Marrakech, offers an ideal platform for parliamentarians and APM’s founding partners. It provides a rich opportunity for interaction with political and economic players, from both the public and private sectors, as well as with academia and civil society.\nIntegration and Cooperation Forum\nThis forum aims to create an expanded South-South trade network and a self-sufficient green energy production and marketing zone. This initiative reflects APM’s commitment to forging political, economic and social cooperation between member states, in order to find common solutions to regional challenges.\nThe forum in this second session therefore focuses on two main themes: the transition to green energy, and support for entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Discussions focus on mechanisms to ensure a sustainable and clean energy supply, while supporting SMEs in this transition. Participants also explore the challenges of innovation, sustainable development and artificial intelligence.\nDiscussions will focus on the production of and access to affordable, sustainable and clean energy. Participants will seek to identify regional solutions to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in this energy transition, promoting economic growth and technological innovation. The aim is to create an integrated economic and financial zone, capable of withstanding external factors and fostering enhanced cooperation between the regions concerned.\nMarrakech Forum Naama Mayara Follow the latest news from Hespress on WhatsApp Newsletter Subscribe now to the newsletter, to receive the latest news daily\nSubscribe Please verify email Pour terminer le processus d'abonnement ..

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "title": "'Time To End The War': Biden Sees Progress On Gaza Deal | IBTimes",
    "text": "President Joe Biden said Thursday that US mediators were making progress in reaching a Gaza ceasefire deal as he called for an end to the Israel-Hamas war.Biden, in a high-stakes, nearly hour-long news conference aimed at repudiating doubters of his reelection bid, acknowledged concerns about Israeli actions despite his overall support for the US ally.\"There's a lot of things in retrospect I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do, but the bottom line is we have a chance now. It's time to end this war,\" he said after a NATO summit in Washington.Biden acknowledged there remained \"difficult, complex issues\" between Israel and Hamas.\"There are still gaps to close. We're making progress,\" Biden said.\"The trend is positive, and I'm determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war, which should end now,\" he said.Biden more than a month ago laid out a plan in which Israel would temporarily halt its offensive in Gaza and Palestinian militants would release hostages, setting the stage for talks for a permanent end to the devastating nine-month war.Hamas came back with counterproposals and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced pushback from some of his hard-right government allies.But diplomats have spoken of progress in the latest round of talks that closed Thursday in Qatar, the key mediator.Biden threw his support behind Israel after the October 7 attack by Hamas which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,345 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.Biden, 81, recalled his meeting a half-century ago as a young senator with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir -- and acknowledged that times have changed.\"We pushed it really hard, and Israel occasionally was less than cooperative,\" Biden said of Netanyahu's government.\"This war cabinet is one of the most conservative war cabinets in the history of Israel, and there's no ultimate answer other than a two-state solution here,\" he said.Biden also stood firm on his decision to hold up delivery of massive 2,000-pound bombs, even as his administration moves forward on other munitions.\"I'm not providing the 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage,\" Biden said.He again pressed Israel for a \"day-after\" plan for the war's end and spoke of his diplomacy to persuade Arab states to help with security.\"At the end of the day, there has to be no occupation by Israel in the Gaza Strip,\" Biden said.He also acknowledged he was \"disappointed\" by a pier to deliver aid into Gaza, which Biden announced in March and the US military built at a cost of $230 million as Israel impeded land routes for aid trucks.The United States plans soon to end the use of the pier permanently after it was plagued by problems, including the weather.\"I was hopeful that would be more successful,\" Biden said.© Copyright AFP ",

    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 29 : Over the past few days, dense fog has engulfed the city, especially in the mornings. A layer of fog blanketed the national capital and its adjoining areas even on Friday morning with moderate to dense fog in isolated pockets of Delhi. Visibility is likely to improve over the day and the minimum temperature recorded stands at 10.7 degrees Celsius -- four notches above the season's average, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. \"Dense to very dense fog conditions are very likely to continue during night/morning hours in many parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh during Thursday night till Saturday (December 30) morning and in some parts for subsequent three days,\" said the IMD. The IMD classifies fog intensity into four types -- shallow, moderate, dense and very dense fog. The visibility ranges from 999m to 500m, 499m to 200m, 199m to 50m and < 50m, respectively. Delhi's Palam station recorded 150m and Safdarjung 200m visibility, according to IMD. As the day unfolds, the fog is forecasted to gradually dissipate, revealing a clearer atmosphere by the afternoon. Flight and train schedules are also being affected, with many flights experiencing delays and some possibly facing cancellations. Over 60 international and domestic flights arrival and departure faced delays, owing to low visibility. In a fog-induced challenge for commuters, several trains arriving in the Delhi region are also dealing with delays, causing frustration among passengers. Delhi's air quality remained in the 'severe' category. The AQI scale categories levels from 0 to 500, with Anand Vihar breaching the 'severe' threshold. At the Anand Vihar area, PM2.5 levels remained into the 'severe' category standing at 473 and PM10 reached 447, and CO plummeted to 107, classified as 'moderate', according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The Air Quality Index (AQI) between zero and 50 is considered 'good'; 51 and 100 'satisfactory'; 101 and 200 'moderate'; 201 and 300 'poor'; 301 and 400 'very poor'; and 401 and 500 'severe'. The Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport T3 witnessed PM2.5 levels at 425 and PM10 at 405, both falling under the 'severe' category. The CO level was recorded at 104, maintaining a 'moderate' rating.",
