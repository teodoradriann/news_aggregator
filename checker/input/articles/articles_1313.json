    "text": "FRENCH POLYNESIA, — The island of Raiatea in French Polynesia is known as the sacred island. And if you travel off the beaten path, you'll discover how it earned that title.\nNIU Shack is a guesthouse located deep in the heart of the island up an impossibly bumpy road covered in mud. It's not an easy trek, but one well worth the effort.\n\"The way we treat you, it's like you're rewarded for stepping out from your comfort zone,\" said co-owner Teua Rangi Bourgeois.\nTeua Rangi and her mother Vicki own and operate the off-the-grid property. Their family has been in this valley for a thousand years and it's here they reconnect with their ancestors.\n\"When you arrive in this valley, you feel it in your body,\" said Teua Rangi. \"It's a different atmosphere.\"\nThey recently opened up their home sharing their lifestyle with visitors.\n\"We just want to connect people to nature so they get inspired and live a more sustainable life,\" Teau Rangi said.\nNIU Shack is powered by solar energy and the water comes from the river that runs through the valley. The food is plant-based using mostly fruit and flora foraged from the land. Vicki prepares all of the meals in a bamboo kitchen that's open to the elements which inspires her to create new recipes and flavor combinations.\n\"She's not just cooking,\" said Teau Rangi. \"She's making art.\"\nGuests can also experience Tahitian beauty rituals like a coconut salt scrub with coconut grown on the property. Teau Rangi will even get you involved by having you shred the coconut.\nOnce the ingredients are gathered, you'll make your way down to the bank of the river where the treatment begins with a meditative breathing exercise. Then the scrub is mixed and massaged into your arms and legs. It's then rinsed off in the river revealing silky smooth skin.\nIt's an experience that leaves you renewed both inside and out. It also reveals a deeper connection to this place and this planet.\n\"My intention when people come here is that they feel something new,\" said Teau Rangi. \"At the same time, other people see hope. Hope in the future, hope for a better planet and hope for themselves.\"\nSponsored by Air Tahiti Nui\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest.

AGM-114K: A variant with a millimeter-wave seeker for enhanced target discrimination. Platforms for Hellfire Missile Deployment The versatility of the Hellfire missile is further enhanced by its compatibility with various platforms, including:\nHelicopters: Hellfire missiles are commonly launched from attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache and AH-1 Cobra. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Hellfire missiles can be deployed from UAVs, such as the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper, providing extended reach and reduced risk to human pilots. Fixed-Wing Aircraft: Certain fixed-wing aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II and F-16 Fighting Falcon, are also capable of launching Hellfire missiles. The Hellfire R9X Ninja Missile: A Game-Changer Among the most remarkable variants of the Hellfire missile is the R9X Ninja missile, shrouded in secrecy and speculation. This variant is believed to employ a kinetic warhead, eliminating the need for explosives and minimizing collateral damage. The R9X Ninja missile has been reportedly used in targeted strikes against high-value targets, demonstrating its surgical precision.\nThe Future of the Hellfire Missile As technology continues to advance, the AGM-114 Hellfire missile is also undergoing modernization efforts. The United States military is exploring potential replacements for the Hellfire missile, seeking enhanced capabilities and improved performance. Some concepts include hypersonic missiles, directed energy weapons, and autonomous drone swarms.\nConclusion:\nThe AGM-114 Hellfire missile stands as a testament to the ingenuity and technological prowess of modern warfare. Its precision, versatility, and adaptability have made it a formidable weapon in the hands of the United States and its allies. As the future of warfare evolves, the Hellfire missile and its successors will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the battlefield.",

    "title": "Chiefs put Dolphins on ice to capture frigid wild-card victory - Top World News Today",
    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It was so cold that Patrick Mahomes’ helmet shattered on a hit . Andy Reid’s mustache froze on the sideline. Fans and players alike huddled for warmth, trying their best to grit their way through the fourth-coldest game in NFL history. The Kansas City Chiefs managed to handle the adversity well Saturday night. Handled the Miami Dolphins quite well, too. Mahomes threw for 262 yards, found Rashee Rice eight times for 130 yards and a touchdown, and made several daring runs for key first downs. Isiah Pacheco pounded over the frozen turf for 89 yards and another score. And the Chiefs shut down a prolific Miami offense in a 26-9 victory in the wild-card round of the playoffs. Harrison Butker added four field goals for the reigning Super Bowl champs, who appear to be warming up for another run. “Guys came with that attitude, that mentality — we knew it was going to be cold,” Mahomes said. “All week we were preaching, ‘Let’s come in there with that fire and just get after it and see what happens.’” Meanwhile, the injury-depleted Dolphins (11-7) looked nothing like the same dynamic offense that led the league in yards. Tua Tagovailoa was pressured relentlessly by the NFL’s second-ranked defense, wide receiver Tyreek Hill had a 53-yard TD catch but was otherwise shut down in his return to Kansas City, and the Dolphins finished with 264 yards in all. They have not won at Arrowhead Stadium since Nov. 6, 2011, nor won a playoff game since Dec. 30, 2000. “Losing is never fun, and when the stakes are higher — when it’s playoff time — you feel that maybe 10 times more,” said Tagovailoa, who was just 20 of 39 for 199 yards passing with an interception. “We’ve got to live with that loss.” The Chiefs get to live with another win in their 15th consecutive home playoff game, not counting a trio of Super Bowls that netted them two Lombardi Trophies. But they will head to Buffalo next week if the Bills beat the Steelers on Monday in a game pushed back a day by a blizzard. Otherwise, the Chiefs will host Houston, which beat the Browns earlier Saturday. “Everybody was out there playing for each other,” Rice said. “We just put the weather to the side and knew that our opponent didn’t want to be out there just as much as we didn’t, and we showed our love for the game.” It was minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-20 Celsius) at kickoff, easily setting a record for the coldest game at Arrowhead Stadium. But it was wind gusts, whipping through at more than 25 mph and driving the wind chill to a bone-rattling minus-27 degrees, that made the weather truly miserable for just about everyone. That included pop star Taylor Swift, who once again turned up to see her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She at least got to watch from an enclosed suite. Most fans bundled up outside in parkas, ski goggles and snow pants, and players huddled around heaters on the sidelines as if they were oases in the cold. The National Weather Service even issued a warning for what it called “dangerously cold” weather that had blanketed the Midwest. In fact, the cold may have made Mahomes’ helmet brittle enough that a hit in the third quarter knocked a chunk of the plastic shell from it. Once officials saw the fist-sized hole, they made Mahomes get a backup helmet from the bench. “We have to talk about where we store the backup,” Mahomes said with a smile. “It was like, frozen.” The weather didn’t seem to bother Hill, who was playing in Kansas City for the first time since his old team traded him to Miami two years ago. The league’s leading receiver warmed up in a short-sleeve shirt, then proceeded to scorch the stout Chiefs defense and All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie for a his long touchdown reception midway through the first half. “It’s where it all started for me,” Hill said afterward. “Just being back on the field brought back so many memories.” The Dolphins otherwise struggled on offense, though, just as they did in a 21-14 loss to the Chiefs in November in Germany. They were just 1 for 12 on third down, and they never put together a truly sustained drive until the fourth quarter. “We knew they were going to put a lot of attention toward our receivers,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. “We thought we had the right plan and obviously it wasn’t, and hats off to them for executing their plan in the most important time.” On offense, the Chiefs scored on four of their six first-half drives. Mahomes capped the first with his TD toss to Rice, and while ensuing drives continually fizzled in the red zone, Butker added a trio of field goals to help Kansas City forge a 16-3 lead. “Butker was phenomenal,” Reid said. “That was like kicking a block of ice.” The Chiefs added another field goal in the third quarter, but it was still a two-possession game in the fourth when the Dolphins appeared to force another field goal. But a late flag on Christian Wilkins for roughing the passer on third down gave Kansas City a fresh set of downs, and Pacheco plowed into the end zone moments later to give the Chiefs a 26-7 lead. The Dolphins never threatened down the stretch in their 11th straight loss when game-time temps are 40 degrees or less. Far less, in this case. Commercial content 21+.

    "text": "BNEI BRAK, Israel — Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men blocked a major highway in central Israel for two hours on Thursday to protest a recent Supreme Court decision ordering young religious men to enlist for military service.\nMilitary service is compulsory for most Jewish men and women in Israel. But politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties have won draft exemptions for their followers that allow them instead to study in religious seminaries.\nThis long-standing arrangement has bred widespread resentment among the broader public — a sentiment that has grown stronger during the eight-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Over 600 soldiers have been killed, and tens of thousands of reservists have been activated, straining careers, businesses and family lives.\nProtesters sat on the highway and lay on the ground as police lifted them up and dragged them away. Officers mounted on horseback charged into the crowd. Many demonstrators held signs and chanted ''To prison! Not to the army!''\n''We all came here for one goal, we reflect the position of all the Orthodox public,\" said a young man, identifying himself only by his first name Ozer. ''All the Orthodox public prefers to go to prison and not to the army.''\nThe ultra-Orthodox see their full-time religious study as their part in protecting the state. Many fear that greater contact with secular society through the military will distance adherents from strict observance of the faith.\nThe Supreme Court this week ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men, saying the system of exemptions is unequal.\nThe decision could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Ultra-Orthodox parties and their followers oppose any change in the system.\nThe ultra-Orthodox make up roughly 13% of Israel's population. But under the country's fragmented political system, they wield significant political power and often serve as political kingmakers.\nThe parties are key members of Netanyahu's governing coalition and could potentially force new elections if they decide to leave the government.\nUltra-Orthodox leaders have not yet said whether they will quit the government, but their followers have scheduled a large protest in Jerusalem on Sunday.",

    "text": "When it is said that women “talk to each other” We mean not only that we are a safe place for everyone, but that in those conversations you end up finding the courage and fortitude to say “it’s over” , “I do believe you.” To express with complicity that “If it happens to someone, they are not crazy” as one of the women victims of abuse by Íñigo Errejón wrote in an Instagram message – addressed to journalist Cristina Fallarás – whose complaints that are now impossible to contain have caused the resignation of the former spokesperson for the Sumar parliamentary group .\nAs has happened so many other times in cases of this type, at first it seemed to be an isolated testimony, but the others soon arrived. “It’s being tremendous, there are many, many,” explains to the phone Fallarás, who since he dynamited the #tellit dedicates her Instagram profile to giving visibility to hundreds of stories of women who They relate from their own flesh different episodes of sexual violence, machismo and misogyny. . But the conversation with Fallarás continues with a key statement: “They are terrified.” They are afraid because they know the stigma and the fear of re-victimization, the fear of being singled out, judged by a society that, on too many occasions, remains lenient towards aggressors and hostile to them, the victims.\nIt could be paradoxical that dozens of users echoed the case on social networks and pointed directly to Errejón – despite the fact that the victim only referred to “a politician who lives in Madrid”, a socially outraged” who “never takes his name”. head on the days of 8M” – but then the vast majority of them have not wanted to speak, at least not yet.\nFor now, we only have the name of the actress and presenter Elisa Mouliaá who contacted Public this Thursday afternoon via direct message, explaining that she was another of the victims of sexual harassment by Íñigo Errejón and that she wanted to report it. Although we know that there are more than a dozen who could relate similar episodes with the former deputy. It is worth remembering that a little over a year ago a thread in X from an anonymous profile already set off alarm bells with another harassment situation that directly mentioned Errejón. The woman even said that a member of the politician’s cabinet had tried to dissuade her from reporting what happened to court.\nNevertheless, general fear is not unfounded . Telling it continues to be read, above all, as a disruptive and even dangerous act, especially if instead of assuming responsibility or, at least, opening a space for self-criticism, Errejón presents his resignation, avoiding any direct allusion to the victims or the abuse. reported. Or when you see how the environment becomes silent, looks away and acts as an invisible barrier rather than questioning his own.\n“Eloquent silences from those who do not usually remain silent even under water”, as he has criticized from his X account Lorena Ruiz-Huerta former deputy of the 10th legislature of the Madrid Assembly for Podemos, who knows and has worked very closely with Errejón. The lawyer, who He has referred to Errejón’s resignation as an “episode of justice” has been very harsh with “those who already silenced, in a complicit manner, in the party and even encouraged more and more” the former spokesperson. And she wanted to insist that “it doesn’t happen to us, pressure and responsibility don’t make us bad.”\nIn his statement, Errejón alluded to neoliberal inertia something like the speed of institutional politics to justify what happened, but figures like Guillermo Zapata have shown that It’s something that comes from afar and, above all, what no one close to us has taken care of until everything has blown up. “I have shared political spaces with Íñigo Errejón at various times in my life. I didn’t realize this until very recently. There is a part of what happened that also falls on my side. Saying it now changes little, but keeping quiet is worse,” he wrote in X.\nZapata’s tweet responds to a publication of the journalist and writer Marta G. Franco where she expresses what many have been thinking and sharing all day: fed up and tired of the fact that “we feminists have to be the ones who always have to report on this shit.” Again, as experts have warned so many times, without the environment of impunity that breathe crimes against women, nothing would be possible. EITHER, in the words –again– of Fallarás: a society has the violence that it tolerates .\nHowever, the sisterhood, the efforts of the feminist movement – ​​which since 2017 has regained great momentum – and the work of initiatives such as the # tell it or the # It’s Over –which offer spaces and loudspeakers to make visible a systematic and interestingly hidden violence–, have managed to make it less and less.\n#Errejón #scandal #portrays #wall #impunity #silence #crack #sorority #among #victims",
