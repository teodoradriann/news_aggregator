    "text": "Derrick Henry rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown in what might have been his last game for the Tennessee Titans as they quashed the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars’ hopes of a second straight AFC South title with a 28-20 win Sunday in Nashville, Tenn.\nRyan Tannehill completed 17 of 26 passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns with an interception in what was probably his last game for Tennessee (6-11). Both Henry and Tannehill become free agents in March.\nTrevor Lawrence hit 29 of 43 attempts for 280 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Jacksonville (9-8). It was a disappointing end to a highly anticipated season for the Jaguars, which lost five of their last six games to miss the playoffs.\nLawrence’s fourth-and-2 throw from the Jaguars’ 33 sailed wide of Evan Ingram with 1:47 left in the game, enabling the Houston Texans to win the division title. The result also sealed playoff spots for the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers, locking down the AFC field.\nThe Jaguars had a chance to possibly tie the game with 7:13 remaining on a fourth-and-goal play from the 1, but Lawrence’s attempt to reach the ball across the goal line on a sneak was stopped about a half-yard shy.\nBrandon McManus initiated scoring for Jacksonville at the 9:45 mark of the first quarter with a 44-yard field goal, but Tennessee answered on its first drive. Tannehill ended a 75-yard march with a 28-yard touchdown pass to Tyjae Spears with 5:57 on the clock.\nLawrence gave the Jaguars a 10-7 edge with a 59-yard scoring strike to Calvin Ridley less than three minutes into the second quarter. However, Henry regained the lead for the Titans with an 18-yard touchdown run with 8:27 left.\nSpears made it 21-10 on Tennessee’s next possession, cashing in a Lawrence interception with a 3-yard scoring run 3:03 before halftime.\nJacksonville shaved three points off the lead as the half ended with McManus’ 30-yard field goal, four plays after a dropped punt snap set up the Jaguars at the Titans’ 38.\nTannehill connected with DeAndre Hopkins on a 6-yard touchdown pass for the lone score of the third quarter. The Jaguars closed to 28-20 on Lawrence’s 14-yard scoring toss to Engram with 14:55 left in regulation.\n–Field Level Media",

La activación del aviso se produjo a las 5.00 horas de la pasada madrugada debido a las abundantes precipitaciones recogidas durante la noche para esta comarca y las del Condado, el Andévalo, si bien estas dos ya no están en ese riesgo. Según la información del servicio Emergencias 112 de Andalucía, para toda la provincia permanece activo el aviso naranja por lluvias; además, hay aviso amarillo por tormentas eléctricas en Aracena, el Andévalo y el Condado. Por ello, desde este servicio también se llama a extremar la precaución y a evitar desplazamientos. Por lo que respecta a las incidencias, desde esta madrugada hasta las 12:00 horas el número se ha elevado hasta cerca del centenar, las principales por anegaciones de sótanos, calles y viviendas de planta baja, en su mayoría en las poblaciones de Cartaya, Aljaraque, la capital y Punta Umbría. Actualmente mantienen activos sus Planes de Emergencias Municipales Punta Umbría, Lepe, Cartaya, Ayamonte, Isla Cristina, Almonte, Aljaraque y Huelva.

    "title": "College Football Analyst Shares Interesting Idea for Annual Army-Navy Game",
    "text": "College Football Analyst Shares Interesting Idea for Annual Army-Navy Game\nOne of the most highly-anticipated college football matchups every year is the annual Army-Navy Game.\nThe rivalry between the service academies dates back to 1890 when the first meeting between the teams was held on Nov. 29.\nIn all but 10 years since that point in time, the Army West Point Black Knights and Navy Midshipmen have faced off with the rivalry being renewed each year since 1930.\nFor a long time, the game was played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, which is when many college football teams ended their regular season.\nHowever, more recently, the game has been played on the second Saturday in December as a standalone contest, showcasing Army and Navy in the final regular season game of the college football campaign.\nUnfortunately, it isn’t a standalone game like it used to be.\nThe football schedule, both college and NFL, stays busy throughout December, which has led to analyst Joel Klatt offering up a bold idea about the Army-Navy Game.\nInstead of it being the final regular season game, why not make it the first?\n“So what do we do with Army-Navy? It’s getting pinched by the Heisman. It’s getting pinched by the Playoff. We now play a bowl game on the same day. It’s not in the right spot. Army-Navy needs to start the football season. Week Zero of football. And mind you, I didn’t say college. I didn’t say the NFL. It’s because it’s both,” he said on his podcast, The Joel Klatt Show: A College Football Podcast.\nHe does make some valid points throughout his discussion.\nOutside of eight campaigns for Army and 10 for Navy, they have been independent schools in football. That is no longer the case as both are members of the American Athletic Conference, but this matchup doesn’t count toward their AAC records.\nThere would be a lot of intrigue out of the Army-Navy Game that ends the regular season if they were to face off in the conference championship just days before.\n“I don’t think that we should have Army-Navy right after the conference championship games,” Klatt stated. “I believe that the Army-Navy game is one of the most special events that we have in our country. It’s one of the great football games on the planet, and it’s getting pinched where it’s at. I know it’s the traditional time frame and point of season, but think about it — Army and Navy are now in a conference. Yet, their game doesn’t have any bearing on whether they’re going to the conference championship game or not, which we just saw this year with Navy. Then, they’ve got to play that game, which is, you know — it’s going to mean everything to them and should, because again, in a lot of ways, outside of the Rose Bowl, it’s the most historic college football game that we have.”\nThere are probably a lot of people who agree with Klatt, and it is something that could certainly be taken into consideration down the line.\nBut, it is hard to imagine changes being made when it remains one of the most popular games on the college football calendar for viewership.\nThe 2024 edition was the second-most watched game on CBS this year behind only the Big Ten championship that was played between the Penn State Nittany Lions and Oregon Ducks.",

    "text": "Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has the potential to spill into a wider war “that no one can control”, Sir Keir Starmer warned at the United Nations.\nIn his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Sir Keir pleaded with both sides to step back from the brink and agree a ceasefire following escalating clashes across the Lebanon border.\nStressing the need to prevent a regional conflict in the Middle East, he said “further escalation serves no one”.\n“I call on Israel and Hezbollah. Stop the violence. Step back from the brink,” he said.\n“We need to see an immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement and we are working with all partners to that end.”\nHe warned that the alternative is “more suffering for innocent people on all sides and the prospect of a wider war that no one can control and with consequences that none of us can foresee”.\nSir Keir also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\nAddressing the humanitarian crisis, he said: “It shames us all that the suffering in Gaza continues to grow.”\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with business leaders in New York (Leon Neal/PA) Sir Keir called for the UN to be reformed and strengthened, saying the war in Ukraine was a test for the organisation.\nHe said the UK would “stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”.\n“Because the alternative would be to confirm the worst claims about this place.\n“That international law is merely a paper tiger and that aggressors can do what they will.\n“We will never let that happen.”\nSir Keir’s speech was intended to show that under his premiership the UK would offer “responsible global leadership”.\nHe announced a new British International Investment initiative, working with the City of London to use billions of pounds from pension and insurance funds “to invest in boosting development and fighting climate change”.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called for reform of the UN Security Council (Leon Neal/PA) Sir Keir also called for a new international levy on global shipping to “put a price on the true cost of emissions” with the money raised going to tackle climate change.\nThe Prime Minister also demanded changes to the UN Security Council “to become a more representative body” which was “willing to act – not paralysed by politics”.\nThat would involve permanent African representation on the body,\nThe existing five permanent members – the UK, US, France, China and Russia – should be joined by Brazil, India, Japan and Germany, he said.\nAnd he promised a change in the way the UK acted too: “Moving from the paternalism of the past towards partnership for the future.\n“Listening a lot more – speaking a bit less.”",

    "text": "Heart health tips for when the mercury dips Winter is the right time of year for all kinds of cool activities – skiing, skating and ice fishing, just to name a few. Unfortunately, as the temperature falls, the risk of heart problems heats up. Even if you live far from the nearest iceberg, cold weather can pose problems. Studies have linked low temperatures to an increased risk of stroke, heart-related chest pain, heart rhythm problems and deaths from heart failure and cardiac arrest. Cardiologist Dr. Sherrie Khadanga said an increased risk of heart attack is a top concern in cold weather. \"Usually that ends up due to a patient overexerting themselves doing strenuous physical activity, such as shoveling or walking through heavy snow,\" said Khadanga, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine in Burlington. Dr. Richard Gumina, an interventional cardiologist and associate professor at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, said cardiac arrest – a sudden stoppage of the heart – is a related concern in the cold. \"Sometimes cardiac arrest can be due to a heart attack,\" said Gumina, who also is associate dean for convergent research at Ohio State's College of Medicine. \"Other times it can be due to heart rhythm problems that can be brought on by doing strenuous activity and cold weather.\" One of the main risk factors, Khadanga said, comes from your body's basic reaction to the cold. To conserve warmth, blood vessels constrict to limit blood flow to your skin, which raises your blood pressure. \"And that, in and of itself, can increase the risk of a heart attack or a stroke,\" she said. The lower the air temperature, the worse the problem, she said, and the concern is highest among people with existing heart disease, whose blood flow is already restricted. But many people are unaware they have heart disease until they start having symptoms such as chest pain, Gumina said. Even people living in warm climates can be affected. A review of research, published in March in Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine, looked at data from several studies and found that overall, cold spells increased deaths from cardiovascular disease by 32%. The effect was more pronounced in areas where the weather is typically milder than areas that see cold regularly. But, in news that should warm your heart, Gumina and Khadanga offered simple ways people can protect themselves. Wear the gear Khadanga tells her patients that when they're outside, \"not only should they be wearing layers of clothing, but also hats, gloves and heavy socks\" to stay warm. To that, Gumina adds a mask, \"so you're not taking in just cold air.\" But don't overdo it, Khadanga said. \"You want to dress warmly if you're outside, but you don't want to overheat.\" Shoveling snow? Go slow Several studies have linked snow shoveling to a higher risk of heart attacks. Part of the problem, Gumina said, is that people who aren't usually physically active will attempt it. The combination of a heart that is not conditioned for heavy lifting plus cold-constricted blood vessels that might also be partially blocked from plaque can leave a heart starving for the oxygen-rich blood it needs to function. Gumina said he advises his patients with heart disease to get help to clear the driveway. But those who insist on doing it themselves need to be careful. Just as you wouldn't jump on a treadmill set at the highest level and steepest angle and start running, he said, you shouldn't run right out to the driveway and vigorously attack the drifts. \"Ensure that you've given yourself a little warmup period,\" he said. Then, \"bite it off in small pieces,\" he said, with frequent breaks. And know the symptoms of a heart attack, which can include chest discomfort, shortness of breath and nausea. Stay active – carefully In Vermont, Khadanga is surrounded by people who ski, snowboard and do other outdoor activities in the cold. Even for healthy, active people, taking breaks is important, she said. \"You do a couple of runs down the hill, then you go back inside to warm up,\" she said. Staying physically active is a crucial component of heart health, and you shouldn't be afraid to go out in the cold, Gumina said. But you have to be aware of potential problems. Gumina said winter is the wrong time of year to plunge into an outdoor exercise routine. \"You want to have a period ahead of time where you've been exercising, and then you can transition into something that is cold.\" And if you are going out in the cold weather, \"I always tell people to go in pairs,\" because of the risk of slipping on ice. And stay hydrated, he said. \"You don't realize how much you sweat during that time when you're in cold weather.\" Stock up on meds Khadanga reminds her patients to make sure that they fill prescriptions before winter storms arrive. \"Snow and ice can make the roads extra slippery, and I wouldn't want a patient to run out of necessary medication.\" Vaccines are a heart health issue Cold weather sends people indoors, which boosts the risk of catching the flu or COVID-19. Research shows the risk of having a heart attack is six times higher within a week of having the flu, and COVID-19 has been linked to substantial risk of heart problems and stroke. \"Everyone needs a flu shot and their COVID vaccination,\" Gumina said. \"These are things that we know decrease your risk of having severe disease.\" © American Heart Association, Inc.

    "text": "Disclosure: This post is sponsored by Aon Affinity Insurance Services, Inc., and reflects their views and opinions.\nPicture this: You come home from a hard day at work. You discover dinner on the table and your son has made a hand-drawn card that reads “I love you.” Suddenly, your day isn’t so hard anymore. Who are the people you love? Your children, mother, significant other, husband, sister—the people who make you smile, the ones who support you—the ones whose futures you want to be bright. These are the people life insurance was made for.\nAIChE Member Insurance Solutions has worked with New York Life to create life insurance coverage that works hard for you and yours. Because while you can’t put a price on love, providing for the ones you care about most—when it’s needed most—makes all the difference.\nProvide income for loved ones—when they really need it\nLife insurance can’t replace you, but it can replace some or all of your income if you were to die. In the immediate term, it can cover the cost of funeral expenses, pay off debts and help defray day-to-day expenses like food, clothing, and housing. Longer term, life insurance can help finance college tuition—and even ensure your spouse or partner’s retirement dreams are realized. Life insurance is about enhancing the lives of your loved ones both now and in the future.\nMeet essential household needs\nThink of all the work parents do at home to run a household and care for the family. It’s invaluable—and insuring all they do is, too. Life insurance can pay for vital household services—like childcare, transportation and chores—to make the day-to-day lives of those you hold dear more secure in the event a provider is no longer around.\nGain benefits you can use—during your lifetime\nWhen life puts unforeseen challenges in your way, you need all the help you can get. Optional riders can help you customize the right type of coverage for you. And since AIChE Life Insurance was designed with people like you in mind, there are many features built in which may address your needs.\n- The Chronic Illness Rider provides you with access of up to 50% of your existing life insurance benefit while you are living, if you suffer a qualifying chronic illness. You get money you can use when and as you wish—to help defray costs resulting from a chronic illness or a permanent cognitive condition—while leaving the remaining benefit to your beneficiaries.\n- The Waiver of Premium rider lets you continue coverage without paying the premium, if you become seriously ill or disabled and are unable to earn an income to pay the premium.\n- The Automatic Benefit Increase feature increases your coverage each year (typically according to a fixed increment) to keep pace with your anticipated changes in income and needs. Your premium costs adjust accordingly, but you won’t need to undergo additional medical underwriting on the new coverage amount.\nLeave a lasting legacy\nLife insurance can create a financial legacy—funding the futures and fueling the dreams of the people of your choosing. From supporting a favorite nonprofit to starting a scholarship program, the legacy you leave behind is all up to you. But you need adequate funds to make a real difference. Life insurance can provide the assets you need to improve the lives of others in your name, and help make life easier for the most important people in your life.\nLearn more about features, costs, eligibility, renewability, limitations, and exclusions about group term life insurance.\nMark Thomas\nMark Thomas is Senior Vice President at Affinity Services Insurances, Inc., the administrator for the AIChE Member Insurance Solutions Program, and leads operations, strategic alignment, and growth for Aon Affinity.\nThis AIChE Insurance Program is administered by Affinity Insurance Services, Inc.; a licensed producer in all states (TX13695); (AR Ins.

    "text": "22 agosto 2024 La oposición venezolana se manifestó en contra de la decisión del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela de confirmar a Nicolás Maduro como ganador de las discutidas elecciones presidenciales del pasado 28 de julio.\nEl candidato opositor, Edmundo González Urrutia , publicó en la red social X que “la soberanía reside intransferiblemente en el pueblo” y “los órganos del Estado emanan de la soberanía popular y a ella están sometidos”, un mensaje directamente extractado del artículo 5 de la Constitución venezolana, que ha acompañado de la etiqueta #NoUsurparánLaVerdad.\nAntes de conocerse el fallo, la líder opositora María Corina Machado había publicado que \"no existe maniobra alguna que pueda otorgarle un ápice de legitimidad a Nicolás Maduro, frente al golpe de Estado a la Constitución que pretenden perpetrar\".\nMaduro recurrió al Tribunal Supremo para que iniciara un peritaje del proceso y confirmara la validez de la victoria que le otorgó el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE), lo que ha hecho este jueves .\nSu presidenta, Caryslia Rodríguez, anunció en su sede en Caracas que el tribunal ha resuelto “convalidar” los resultados oficiales anunciados en la misma noche electoral en base a unas actas del CNE que no han sido publicadas.\nSaltar Recomendamos y continuar leyendo Recomendamos La Chama y El Pana, los presentadores creados con inteligencia artificial que usan medios en Venezuela para evitar la oleada de arrestos del gobierno de Maduro Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela convalida los resultados de las elecciones que dan el triunfo a Nicolás Maduro y que la oposición cuestiona El Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela ratifica que Maduro ganó las elecciones pero aún no muestra las actas Cómo funciona el Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela y por qué se duda de su imparcialidad Final de Recomendamos\nSegún la oposición, González Urrutia fue el candidato más votado por un amplio margen y los resultados anunciados por el presidente del Consejo Nacional Electoral, Elvis Amoroso, que dio por ganador a Maduro con un 52% de los votos, un fraude que subvierte la voluntad expresada por los venezolanos en las urnas.\nLa oposición publicó el 80% de las actas a las que tuvieron acceso sus testigos en los centros electorales y que mostraron un claro triunfo de González Urrutia.\nGran parte de la comunidad internacional ha cuestionado el reparto de votos anunciado por Amoroso.\nUn panel de expertos de Naciones Unidas concluyó que las elecciones no cumplieron con los estándares “de integridad e independencia”.\nEstados Unidos concluyó que González Urrutia fue el más votado, mientras que la Unión Europea y un grupo de 22 países reclamó a las autoridades venezolanas que publiquen las actas electorales, algo que hasta ahora no ha ocurrido.\nLos presidentes de Colombia, Gustavo Petro , y Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , plantearon la posibilidad de repetir las elecciones para resolver la nueva crisis política abierta en el país.\nFuente de la imagen, Getty Images\nPie de foto, Maduro celebró una victoria discutida por la oposición y gran parte de la comunidad internacional. Poco antes de conocer la decisión del TSJ, la Misión de Determinación de los Hechos de Naciones Unidas en Venezuela, alertó sobre la “falta de independencia e imparcialidad” de esta institución y del Consejo Nacional Electoral.\nEl anuncio del triunfo de Maduro hecho por el CNE fue seguido por una ola de protestas en numerosas ciudades de Venezuela que derivó en una ola de detenciones masivas.\nDe acuerdo con la ONG Foro Penal hasta este 18 de agosto habían sido detenidas más de 1.500 personas, incluyendo 129 adolescentes y 18 personas con discapacidad.\nAl respecto, Maduro ha dicho que el gobierno estaba habilitando dos cárceles de \"máxima seguridad\" para albergar a los manifestantes, a quienes calificó como \"terroristas\" y \"delincuentes\"\nHaz clic aquí para leer más historias de BBC News Mundo.\nTambién puedes seguirnos en YouTube , Instagram , TikTok , X , Facebook y en nuestro nuevo canal de WhatsApp , donde encontrarás noticias de última hora y nuestro mejor contenido.\nY recuerda que puedes recibir notificaciones en nuestra app. Descarga la última versión y actívalas.\n\"En Venezuela hay un 'empate catastrófico' y en estos casos cada una de las partes tiene que cortarse un brazo o entregar un hijo\" 22 agosto 2024",
