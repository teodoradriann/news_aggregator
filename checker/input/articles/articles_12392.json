    "title": "These sensors promise to diagnose lung cancer from breath",
    "text": "In the future there could be important advances in the diagnosis of lung cancer. A team of researchers from Zhejiang University, in China, managed to perfect sensors capable of detecting differences in the composition of breath in particular, the decrease in the levels of the molecule called ‘isoprene’, which are the beginnings of this condition. The research was published in the pages of the magazine Ac Sensors and it arrives right in November, the month dedicated to lung cancer awareness.\nBreast cancer screening, an alternative for detection in young women According to researchers, we could optimize breast cancer prevention programs taking into account the individual risk of each woman.\nHow do the new sensors work? The air we exhale is made up of many different molecules: there is carbon dioxide and a lot of water vapor, but also other volatile molecules, including isoprene. Previous research concluded that a decrease in isoprene levels in exhaled air could be an indication of lung cancer. However, capturing these differences is not so easy because the unit of measurement is “parts per million”; Sensitive sensors that resist breath humidity are required, and so far attempts have been poor.\nAccording to the Chinese researchers, their indium oxide sensors can detect isoprene at levels found in human breath. The sensors are made of “nanoflakes” of platinum, indium and nickel, and are capable of detecting isoprene levels as low as 2 parts per billion. A sensitivity never achieved by other models.\nOnce the technical characteristics were determined, the scientists inserted the nanowire sensors into a portable detection device and performed some tests: they introduced exhaled air samples collected from 13 people; five of whom had been diagnosed with lung cancer. The device detected isoprene levels higher than 60 parts per billion in samples from healthy participants and lower than 40 parts per billion in samples from patients with the disease. The authors suggest that this technology could be a breakthrough towards non-invasive lung cancer screening and potentially save lives.\nArticle originally published in WIRED Italy .

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Allegiant Air has announced the closure of its crew and aircraft base at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), citing airport constraints following the planned closure of the South Terminal as the primary reason for adjustments in its base operations. \"Austin is an important city in our network, and we remain committed to serving our passengers with nonstop flights from AUS,\" stated Allegiant Air officials. \"However, due to constraints arising from the planned closure of the [South Terminal](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/abias-south-terminal-lawsuit-settled-city-of-austin-takes-control), Allegiant will cease base operations at AUS effective January 7, 2025.\" The airline's decision to shutter its AUS crew and aircraft base does not signify a departure from the Austin market. Instead, Allegiant remains committed to maintaining its numerous nonstop flights from AUS, which are valued by local travelers for their convenience and affordability. Allegiant's flights will continue to operate from the South Terminal of AUS until they are eventually transitioned to the Barbara Jordan Terminal as part of ongoing airport expansion plans. This transition underscores Allegiant's dedication to serving Austin passengers while adapting to infrastructure improvements at the airport. [ALSO| ATX city council passes resolution requiring safety barriers at medical facilities](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/atx-city-council-passes-resolution-requiring-safety-barriers-at-medical-facilities) \"We appreciate the important value Allegiant Air brings to Central Texas travelers with their nonstop flight offerings,\" stated airport officials. \"Our focus remains on providing a safe, comfortable, and authentically Austin experience for all AUS customers, regardless of their airline choice.\" As a consequence of the base closure, Allegiant will discontinue several routes originating from Austin.

They heard about the good news before they even got out of bed.\n\"She texted me at six in the morning,\" said Chef and Co-owner Keiji Tsukasaki. \"She's like, 'Hey, I saw your newspaper, The New York Times.' And I was like, 'That's good, good surprise.' I didn't expect something like that.\"\nThe Times said: \"The traditional preparations are superb.\" The small-space restaurant specializes in a pre-set, omakase-style menu which translates to, you're leaving the sushi choices up to the chef.\n\"Every day, we just do the two rounds. 16 people each, about 30 people every day. Just one menu. Me and Jun, our goal is to serve good fish,” Tsukasaki said.\nLtd Edition Sushi\n1641 Nagle Pl Suite 006, Seattle, WA 98122\nSEABIRD\nAnother restaurant receiving national praise is\nSeabird on Bainbridge Island. Recently Bon Appetit magazine put the place in their 24 best new restaurants of 2023 list.\n\"They started snooping around. In the springtime, after they interviewed everyone on the staff, I wasn't sure what it was going to manifest as. I thought maybe it'd be doing a piece on Bainbridge and have like a little snippet of balance. But no, it was a huge honor,” said Chef Brendan McGill.\nBon Appetit wrote: \"Chef-owner Brendan McGill's meticulously sourced menu is a heartfelt tribute to the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\"We're focused on seafood and vegetables, the most simply put. But we try to get seafood from the waters close to us. Vegetables from our farm and Bainbridge Island and Kitsap and Olympic peninsula,” said McGill. \"I think it feels quintessentially Pacific Northwest here, which is awesome. That's what we're going for.\"\nSeabird\n133 Winslow Way E, Bainbridge Island, WA 98110\n206-201-3789\nCANLIS\nFinally, awards are nothing new for Seattle fine-dining icon\nCanlis. But when Aisha Ibrahim found out she was named one of Food & Wine magazines' best new chefs, the former basketball player turned cook was caught off guard.\n\"The editor of Food & Wine reached out and like, 'Hey, I would love to do this story on you,'” said Chef Ibrahim. \"And Krusjhman's like, 'Surprise! By the way, this is not a story on Ramadan. Congratulations, you are a best new chef for Food and Wine Magazine.'\"\nFood & Wine wrote: \"She is cultivating a thoroughly modern tasting menu and a positive kitchen culture.\"\n\"We invest a lot of our energy into people.\" said Ibrahim. \"And it's nice to see that come back to see people like bring it and meet you in the middle, it's a gift. My team is a huge gift to me. You have to love your craft, you have to love the intentionality of everything. You have to love hospitality and have to care for guests and care for your team.

    "text": "A warm end to the week with rain chances Saturday ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - This afternoon will feel much more like August as highs will be in the middle 80s with a good amount of sunshine. We will have a few clouds here and there, I’ll chalk it up to partly cloudy. Winds will be on the gusty side out of the southwest near 25 mph, bringing in this warm dry air. The strong wind and dry air will make it dangerous to burn outside so please avoid if you are able. Overnight tonight, a cold front will make it’s way through, shifting our winds to be out of the northeast. Clouds will stick around through the night with lows staying in the mid-50s. Winds continue to shift Saturday to be out of the east. The winds along with some cloud cover in the afternoon will give us a much more fall like day as highs top out in the upper 60s. I can’t rule out an stray shower or storm late tomorrow afternoon/evening as there will be some instability in our atmosphere. The issue with our rain chances comes down to how much moisture is in the atmosphere. It has been exceptionally dry the past few weeks and dewpoints will still be on the lower end. With this in mind any rain will be few and far between but still the chance exists. Yet another cold front will make it’s way through Saturday night which will give us a little bit better chance for showers or a rumble or two, but again we will be dry so it will be more on the scattered side. Lows overnight will bottom out in the mid-40s. Northwesterly winds will be howling Sunday as some gusts could reach 35 mph. This will lower temperatures yet again to the mid-60s. Otherwise, Sunday looks to be pretty pleasant with a few clouds here and there. Looking ahead to the start of next week, it is going to be chilly. Highs will be in the upper to middle 50s, with overnight lows near freezing. This means our first frost chances of the season are likely. Copyright 2024 WIFR. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Jeremy Sarmiento, un futbolista que provoca que “los hinchas se levanten”, asegura Carlos Corberán, DT del West Bromwich FC | Fútbol | Deportes | El Universo",
    "text": "Jeremy Sarmiento salió del Brighton y fichó por el West Bromwich Albion en busca de sumar minutos y recuperar su estado de forma. Una lesión en el metatarsiano jugando para la selección ecuatoriana, hizo que el jugador perdiera espacio en las Gaviotas y tenga que salir a buscar un nuevo club. Sin embargo, tanto para la fanaticada de los Baggies como para su entrenador, Carlos Corberán, la llegada del tricolor ha sido una de las cosas más positivas del 2023. El mediocampista ha ido incrementando su rendimiento lo que ha provado que el técnico español lo llene de elogios. [Jeremy Sarmiento sumó minutos en la victoria del West Bromwich por la Championship](https://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/futbol/jeremy-sarmiento-sumo-minutos-en-la-victoria-del-west-bromwich-por-la-championship-nota/) “Yo lo que veo en Jeremy es algo diferente. Yo veo pasión. Y amo la pasión porque uno puede manejar la pasión. Cuando algo falta, es difícil agregarlo en un jugador. Cuando hay un exceso de algo, es más fácil de manejar”, dijo el estratega en diálogo con la prensa inglesa. Publicidad [El ‘equipazo’ que no llevará Ecuador al Preolímpico 2024](https://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/futbol/el-equipazo-que-no-llevara-ecuador-al-preolimpico-2024-nota/) Desde su llegada al club de la segunda división de Inglaterra el pasado mes de julio, el volante ofensivo ya acumula 20 partidos, en los que ha convertido dos goles. Es por eso que el DT de los Throstles destaca el desarrollo que ha tenido en estos meses. “Una cosa que era importante para él es que sumara minutos, la segunda cosa importante es que rinda en la cancha. Vino aquí para que desarrollara como jugador y para poder contar con todo su talento. Y estamos en ese proceso”, destacó Corberán. 'What I see in him is something different. I see a passion. And I love the passion'— ESAlbion_star (@ESAlbion_star) [https://t.co/EyqJv4gf7o] [#Baggies] [December 20, 2023] Y las adulaciones no pararon de llegar: “Jeremy tiene ese perfil. Es un jugador que puede superar a sus rivales en el uno contra uno. Va a darse cuenta de que no es lo único que puede hacer en un partido. Hay otras cosas que debe manejar. A veces necesitas driblar y jugar a un toque”. Publicidad Por último, el valenciano de 40 años resaltó a detalle las cualidades de Sarmiento como futbolista. “Jeremy necesita jugar a un solo toque, en otras, recibir el balón, moverse y dar el pase. Estoy 100% seguro que es un jugador que hace que los hinchas se levanten de su asiento. Una de las razones por las que está aquí es para que driblee y gambetee rivales. Si gambetea a un rival, genera una chance para el equipo”, sentenció el adiestrador. (D)",

Así lo ha anunciado la alcaldesa de Valencia, María José Catalá desde la misma playa de El Saler, que ha visitado, tras dar cuenta del resultado positivo del análisis de las aguas que reflejan que son seguras para el baño.\nEl vertido detectado este martes en el mar y que llegó a la arena de las playas obligó a cerrar estos espacios para la retirada de la sustancia hasta este jueves, que se permitió el acceso público aunque con la bandera roja, ya que el baño no estaba permitido hasta que los análisis de las aguas han concluido que su calidad es óptima.\nUn estudio preliminar apunta que el vertido contiene fuel y algunos aceites, y por esos componentes podría proceder de un buque, según avanzó la delegada del Gobierno en la Comunitat Valenciana, Pilar Bernabé, que ha pedido esperar a que el informe sea concluyente",

    "title": "Aileen Cannon Slaps Down a Donald Trump Request",
    "text": "The main image shows former President Donald Trump speaking during his campaign rally on June 09, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The smaller image shows Judge Aileen Cannon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On Thursday, Cannon rejected Trump&#039;s request for a hearing concerning omissions in the search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago estate. Judge Aileen Cannon on Thursday denied Donald Trump&#039;s motion stating that the FBI provided false or misleading information to justify the 2022 search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. Cannon rejected Trump&#039;s request for a Franks hearing, a legal proceeding to challenge the warrant based on claims of falsified information, because she determined his legal team had not provided sufficient evidence that the search warrant affidavit &quot;contains any material false statements or omissions.&quot; The move affects the former president&#039;s efforts to throw out his classified documents case. Cannon also said she will hold an evidentiary hearing on Trump&#039;s attorney-client privilege, with a notice to schedule it to be issued soon. The Context Trump was indicted last June by Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith on 40 federal charges saying that he illegally retained classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021 and obstructed the government&#039;s efforts to retrieve them. Trump&#039;s indictment came after the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach in August 2022. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has said the case is politically motivated. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, has faced criticism, largely along partisan lines, for her handling of the case, including delaying a trial and not setting a start date. What We Know In her Thursday order, Cannon wrote that Trump &quot;identifies four omissions in the warrant, but none of the omitted information—even if added to the affidavit in support of the warrant—would have defeated a finding of probable cause.&quot; Therefore, she concluded that he did not make the requisite &quot;substantial preliminary showing&quot; to warrant a Franks hearing. If a Franks hearing were to occur and Cannon ruled in favor of the defense, she could throw out the evidence collected during the execution of the search warrant, which is the primary evidence in this case. That is no longer expected, given her denial of Trump&#039;s motion. While Cannon rejected Trump&#039;s motion for a Franks hearing, the judge did not throw out the aspect of Trump&#039;s motion relating to &quot;unlawfully piercing of attorney-client privilege.&quot; She said this &quot;cannot be resolved on the current record&quot; and called for &quot;an evidentiary suppression hearing&quot; on privilege-related issues to be scheduled. Trump&#039;s legal team had requested an evidentiary hearing to challenge whether it was appropriate to break attorney-client privilege, which ensures communications between the parties remain confidential, by using the &quot;crime-fraud exception.&quot; The exemption states that attorney-privilege does not hold for statements that are meant to further or conceal a crime. Last March, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of applying the crime-fraud exemption, allowing prosecutors to bypass attorney-client privilege and access communications between Trump and his former lawyer. The prosecution seeks to use a series of audio notes from Trump&#039;s former lawyer Evan Corcoran as evidence. On Thursday, Cannon wrote in her order that she will make her own determination on the matter. &quot;It is the obligation of this Court to make factual findings afresh on the crime-fraud issue,&quot; she said. In addition, Cannon said the court &quot;agrees with Defendant Trump that ambiguities persist&quot; in the attachment to the warrant, which must comply with the Fourth Amendment. She said that those ambiguities &quot;cannot be resolved on the current record alone&quot; and that &quot;further factual development is warranted.&quot; Contacted by Newsweek, the Department of Justice declined to comment. Newsweek reached out for comment to Trump lawyer Emil Bove via email. What&#039;s Next? It&#039;s not known when the next hearing will take place. Cannon will issue an order to schedule it. A trial in this case is not expected to occur before November&#039;s election. Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee in a very close contest against President Joe Biden. On Thursday night, Trump and Biden will face off in their first debate since 2020. Updated 6/27/24, 4:10 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information and background.
