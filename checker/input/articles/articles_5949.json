    "title": "Clarence Thomas fails to disclose 3 Harlan Crow trips, Senate records show",
    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose three trips that were paid for by GOP mega-donor Harlan Crow, according to information obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee and released Thursday.\nAccording to the panel, Thomas did not disclose information on three trips he took on private jets funded by Crow: a trip from St. Louis to Montana and back to Dallas in 2017; round-trip travel from Washington to Savannah, Ga., in 2019; and round-trip travel from Washington to San Jose in 2021.\nThe information was obtained through documents and information that Crow delivered to the committee dating back seven years.\nAlso included in the trove of Crow’s documents was information about the 2019 trips to Indonesia and California, which included private jet travel for both and an eight-day yacht excursion in Bali. The committee noted that a recent report totaled the gifts Thomas has received at nearly $4.2 million, far exceeding the totals of other justices.\n“Nearly $4.2 million in gifts and even that wasn’t enough for Justice Thomas, with at least three additional trips the Committee found that he has failed to disclose to date,” Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a statement.\n“The Senate Judiciary Committee’s ongoing investigation into the Supreme Court’s ethical crisis is producing new information — like what we’ve revealed today — and makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment.”\nDurbin also noted that the information from Crow was obtained due to the subpoena the panel moved ahead with over mounting questions about the gifts received by justices.\n“As a result of our investigation and subpoena authorization, we are providing the American public greater clarity on the extent of ethical lapses by Supreme Court justices and the need for ethics reform,” Durbin said.\n“Despite an approval rating near all-time lows and never-ending, self-inflicted scandals, Chief Justice [John Roberts] still refuses to use his existing authority to implement an enforceable code of conduct,” the No. 2 Senate Democrat continued. “Until he acts, we will continue our push for the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act to become law.”\nShortly before the committee’s revelations were unveiled, Crow’s office issued a statement noting he agreed to hand over seven years worth of documents and information in exchange for the panel ending its probe into the billionaire Republican donor.\n“Mr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years,” the statement from Crow’s office read. “Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning to resolve the matter.”\n“As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow,” it continued.\nDurbin earlier in the week teased that there “may be some new evidence that comes out” in the coming days but declined to say anything further. He denied that it would have anything to do with recently released recordings of conversations between Justice Samuel Alito and an undercover left-wing filmmaker.\n“It relates to the ethical considerations from some of the justices for gifts they’ve taken and not reported,” he said Monday.\nThe latest revelation comes amid the ongoing Democratic effort to pass a Supreme Court ethics package. Democrats tried to move the bill, authored by Durbin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), on the floor via unanimous consent, but it was blocked by Republicans.\nUpdated at 4:10 p.m. ET",

    "title": "Is your private school dumbing down?",
    "text": "Bankruptcy, as Ernest Hemingway famously said, comes ‘gradually, then suddenly’. For Britain’s private schools floundering in the wake of the VAT rise on fees imposed in January this year, the gradual decline is well underway. Not only have an estimated 11,000 pupils left private schools so far in an unprecedented – and poorly forecast by Labour – mid-academic year exodus and smaller private schools have closed, but now Chinese whispers have begun about the lowering of academic standards.\nAccording to unnamed sources in the Telegraph, headteachers are quoted as saying that they have no choice but to ‘widen the net’, adding that ‘schools where it’s usually very challenging to secure a place’ are now less scrupulous about their standards; ‘you can see how nervous the sector is’. Put simply, if you can cough up, you’re in. Just don’t mention CAT scores or the ISEB. It’s not about that anymore. Instead it’s about ‘pastoral care’, ‘sporting excellence’ and all sorts of other platitudes, rather than your child’s accelerated reader performance.\nThis was always going to happen. No sooner did Labour remove the charitable status of private schools than their demeanour started to change. They are now operating far more like normal industry players than the Byzantine Enid Blyton-esque institutions of yore. Private schools, like all revenue-driven businesses, need to make money and money comes through a blunt headcount, not necessarily the brilliance of the heads in question. No longer charitable institutions that once had to demonstrate significant public benefit through bursaries and other outreach schemes, private schools can’t raise capital in ways that other businesses could. Yes, there were private schools that operated as corporate structures in the prelapsarian days before the VAT rise (Prince Williams’s prep school Wetherby’s for example), but these were in the minority at 30 per cent of the total number of independent schools. Not anymore.\nNaturally this comes as a shock to its core middle to upper-middle class customer, unaccustomed to the nuts and bolts of rude capitalism on display. Once upon a time, you admired the grounds on match day and stood in the pavilion chatting to your fellow mummies about uniform and holiday plans. Now, not a day goes by when parents do not receive some letter or other from the bursar detailing snazzy changes to the school designed to guarantee our loyalty, not just to the institution but to the brand. For it is the revenue-driving potential of the brand that school marketeers salivate over when they create Instagram reels and glossy brochures that will outdo the competition.\nIn my corner of Oxfordshire – a veritable theme-park of private schools – the competition is stiff. A quick WhatsApp straw poll of ambitious mothers reveals some of the ways in which private schools are commercialising themselves: Stowe (alma mater of Richard Branson) is now lowering the price of day places to prep-school rates; Cothill (famously the feeder school to Eton) will go co-educational from September 2025 joining Winchester and other schools that can no longer afford to be single-sex; my own daughter’s prep school will open a senior school from 2026 with discounted fees up to GCSE level.\nBut as schools are finding out, intensive and commercial net-widening inevitably comes at the attrition of standards and the ire of parents. Pleading anonymity, several mothers muttered that pupils that would ‘never normally be through the door’ were found in their children’s classes, a trend that will likely continue as the new academic year approaches in September 2025 and private schools find themselves at the sharp end of the margin. A margin that, as one bursar told me, ‘comes down to the bloody wire… it’s often just a question of a family or a single pupil that tips the balance’. Certainly, the big-name private schools – Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Westminster – will always have their pick of the best pupils and may continue to be over-subscribed, but it is beyond doubt that the pool of parents is smaller and more demanding.\nSmaller, more modest institutions such as Park Hill in Surrey (recently closed) have already lost out. In a time of unprecedented sector transition from charitable to commercial endeavour, it seems that disruption comes equally from within as without.\nMy daughter, upon hearing that she may be able to stay at her prep school until she is 16, jumps for joy. I don’t have the heart to tell her that either the school or her parents may be bankrupt before then. But not to worry, it will all be very sudden. Just ask Hemingway.",

    "text": "We’ve seen a lot of Shakespeare in our time, although this week was our first opportunity to catch The Comedy of Errors – one of the bard’s earlier plays, it’s not performed as frequently as some of his better-known shows. Having finally caught it, we can see why – it’s far from Shakespeare’s finest work. If you think you’ve already seen a stupid comedy or two, prepare for things to get a whole lot sillier – this is one of the daftest and most wildly improbable plays we’ve ever seen. The Comedy of Errors contains all the usual Shakespeare comedy tropes, but this time there’s not just one case of mistaken identity – there are two. The play follows two sets of identical twins, separated by a shipwreck, and unexpectedly reunited when the father of one pair of twins is faced with execution. We witness the moments that their lives start to cross and all the shenanigans that ensue. It’s a ridiculous and, at times, quite baffling show: a huge fight erupted right at the start of the play, and we’re still not entirely sure why that happened, or whether it brought anything to proceedings other than being yet another overblown moment. However, we should stress that it’s all actually quite good fun – it might be daft and at times it might not make much sense, but it’s perfectly enjoyable to watch. The cast do well to bring out the comedy in the show – whether it’s the high-camp delivery of a soliloquy, or some inventive physicality, or a brilliantly-executed visual gig (there are some hilarious reveals), this is a show which elicits genuine laughs from its audience throughout. The musicians really add to the evening, too – and not just through music. There are some great sound effects deployed with expert timing, and just watching them react to the action on-stage is amusing in itself. The Comedy of Errors may not be one of Shakespeare’s finest moments, and if you’ve not seen much of his work, there are plenty of better places to start. That being said, this is an enjoyable production which really brings out the comedy, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments – and, of course, The Globe is quite a charming theatre if you’ve not experienced it before. A perfectly pleasant way to spend a late summer’s evening. GAY TIMES gives The Comedy of Errors – 3/5 More information can be found [here](https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/the-comedy-of-errors/).",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Dorchester County, Maryland from 1901-2000 was 37.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Dorchester County, Maryland experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Dorchester County, Maryland history.",
