    "text": "Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n© 2025 Blaze Media LLC. All rights reserved.\nPhiladelphia Eagles sell out of pints of 'field snow' from playoff game in mere hours: 'Somebody's going to really buy snow?'\nJanuary 23, 2025\nThe 'authenticated' snow was sold in ice cream-style containers and limited to just 100 units.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles sold pints of snow from their stadium after a playoff game ... and fans actually bought them.\nAfter officially partnering with memorabilia company The Realest, the Eagles sold \"commemorative snow\" collected from inside their stadium that was likely stepped all over in the Eagles' 28-22 Divisional Round victory over the Los Angeles Rams.\nThe snow was \"carefully preserved and authenticated,\" the team told WPVI-TV on Wednesday.\nThe Realest announced the product on its social media pages, describing it as \"fresh snow from the Eagles end zone at Lincoln Financial Field.\"\nThe description went on, \"Packaged with dry ice and authenticated on site, this frozen memento captures the spirit of Saquon Barkley’s 205-yard masterpiece and the magic of this historic playoff game.\"\nThe company boasted, \"Don't miss your chance to own the first-ever authenticated snow collectible tied to one of the greatest games in Eagles history.\"\nThe post then, of course, linked to the store where, at the time of this writing, the snow was sold out. Headlines indicated the snow was actually swooped up by likely-diehard fans in fewer than three hours; The Realest was unavailable for comment on the exact timeframe.\nA post shared by The Realest on X claimed that just 100 units of the frozen tundra were made available, with the listing showing a price of $50 per unit.\n\"Packaged in insulated containers with dry ice and detailed care instructions,\" the website listing explained.\nIt added, \"To ensure the field snow arrives in pristine condition, each order is shipped in an insulated package with 2 lbs of dry ice to maintain optimal preservation. The $15 shipping fee covers all necessary materials and handling to securely deliver this unique collectible.\"\nThe website's disclaimer also noted that \"Items are sold in 'as-is' condition.\"\nAccompanying the product listing was a short video showing a series of credentialed shovelers at Lincoln Financial Field gathering up snow to be tossed into a plastic bin.\n'People bought snow?'\nEagles reporter Zach Berman seemingly caught up with one of the players to ask him about the snow.\n\"Somebody's going to really buy snow? People bought snow?\" Eagles cornerback Darius Slay asked.\n\"That's why this is the best city, man,\" Slay continued. \"They're passionate around here. They're buying snow. I love it. You know what? Let me go pack up some snow right now. They can buy mine.\"\nOther strange stories have surrounded the Eagles playoff run this year; wide receiver A.J. Brown was spotted reading a book on the sidelines, with the book immediately shooting to No. 1 on Amazon's best-sellers list.\nThe next week, before the game against the Rams, fans were shocked to see Brown arriving at the stadium driving a Honda Accord. The $24,000 car went viral given that Brown is currently on a $100 million contract.\nAnother video soon circulated online that showed Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker pumping up fans before the game. The only problem was that Parker misspelled \"Eagles\" while leading a chant.\n\"Let me hear you all say E-L-G-S-E-S, Eagles!\" the mayor yelled. Two days later, the mayor joked, \"We don't promise perfection, I'm so happy that I never have, especially after I couldn't spell Eagles right.\"\nPhiladelphia will play against the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship on Sunday.\nLike Blaze News?

The Adani Group, India’s largest infrastructure conglomerate, began its annual week where all the listed group companies have their annual general meetings (AGM) lined up back-to-back. The week commenced with the keynote address from [Gautam Adani](https://www.thehansindia.com/home/tags/Gautam Adani), speaking to his 6.7 million shareholders globally. Gautam Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur known for building India’s largest infrastructure entity, highlighted three pivotal themes in his address - the Group’s resilience in overcoming external challenges, India’s ascent on the global stage, and the future opportunities for the conglomerate and its extensive shareholder base of 6.7 million shareholders across 11 listed companies. Drawing from his upbringing in the deserts of Gujarat, the soft-spoken Gautam Adani underscored the value of perseverance instilled by his mother, stating: \"The true measure of our success is less about our achievements and more in our ability to stand firm in the face of adversity. In my case, I picked my lessons from my mother. Growing up in the harsh deserts of Banaskantha, what I learnt from her is that true strength lies in perseverance.\" \"It is this perseverance that has allowed us to become one of the most admired companies in the country. And our perseverance was never more evident than that we demonstrated this past year. In the face of unprecedented attacks on our integrity, we proved our resilience,\" he remarked, attributing the Group’s recovery to its core values of courage, trust and commitment. Highlighting India’s growing influence globally and its pivotal role in addressing climate change, Gautam Adani asserted: \"The world is witnessing the rise of India. This is India’s moment. We are now the force for stability, cooperation and progress in a complex world. And it is India’s macroeconomic stability and ambitious growth plans that inspire our confidence.\" With India targeted to become a 10 trillion-dollar economy by FY32, the spend on infrastructure is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25 per cent and reach a cumulative spend of $2.5 trillion. \"Given that, at the very core, we are an infrastructure company, we are well positioned to capitalise on the upcoming opportunities,\" said the Group Chairman. Outside the government, Adani Group remains the largest infrastructure developer with its extensive portfolio spanning power, ports, roads, airports, data centres, defence, manufacturing, logistics, and material. \"Our ability to conceptualise and then handle complexity and execute very large projects in difficult conditions is an unmatched competency that we continue to get better at,” Gautam Adani said, as he spoke about the group’s various ultra-scale projects including the world’s largest renewable park at Khavda, Gujarat and real estate project at Dharavi, Mumbai. \"And the outcomes are manifested in the financial numbers we delivered,\" he added. In FY24, the Group delivered a record performance registering a $10 billion EBITDA (Earnings before interest tax and depreciation) milestone with a 45 per cent growth year-on-year. Its net profit grew by 70 per cent. The group holds cash of more than $7 billion and the group-level debt is down to 2.2 times, much lower than infrastructure industry standards of 3.5-4.5 times.",
