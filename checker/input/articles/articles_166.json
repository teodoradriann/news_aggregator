    "text": "OpenAI launched a new feature called Study Mode on ChatGPT on Tuesday. The tool is designed to help students engage in conversations that promote learning and deeper understanding. Study Mode has begun rolling out to users on the Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, and will soon be available on ChatGPT Edu.\nIn a rush? Here are the quick facts:\nOpenAI launched Study Mode for ChatGPT Users will be able to engage in interactive conversations that promote learning and deeper understanding. Study Mode has begun rolling out to users on the Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, and will soon be available on ChatGPT Edu. According to the official announcement , ChatGPT has become one of the main tools for learning across the world. However, concerns remain about whether or not students are truly understanding and processing the information they receive. Study mode aims to provide an interactive learning experience rather than simply delivering answers.\n“Instead of doing the work for them, study mode encourages students to think critically about their learning,” said Robbie Torney, Senior Director of AI Programs at Common Sense Media. “Features like these are a positive step toward effective AI use for learning. Even in the AI era, the best learning still happens when students are excited about and actively engaging with the lesson material.”\nAs ChatGPT becomes a go-to tool for students, we’re committed to ensuring it fosters deeper understanding and learning.\nIntroducing study mode in ChatGPT — a learning experience that helps you work through problems step-by-step instead of just getting an answer. pic.twitter.com/B8VbRYJH6r\n— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 29, 2025\nOpenAI said it has been working with pedagogy experts, teachers and scientists to develop the tool, with a particular focus on college students.\nAmong its main features, OpenAI highlighted Socratic questioning—a methodology also used by Anthropic in its ‘Claude for Education’ program—which guides students toward active learning. Other features include personalized support tailored to the student’s level, knowledge quizzes, and progress tracking.\nOpenAI showed in short videos how study mode operates, like teaching a student about Game Theory and designing a learning guide, or helping another user with a homework on algorithms.\nThe company clarified that the feature has limitations and that they expect to gain more feedback to improve the learning tool.\nOpenAI is also working on an AI education project in the United States , align with Microsoft and Anthropic, to support educators across with AI training, and building a facility in New York.\nNext Story Did you enjoy this article?

    "text": "Karl Rove endorsed North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for former President Donald Trump’s running mate, making the remark on Thursday, days ahead of the Republican National Convention taking place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nTrump has yet to officially announce his choice for vice president and is expected to make that announcement any day now. However, there has been chatter with a few names continually surfacing, including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Burgum. As for Karl Rove, he believes Burgum is the correct choice.\nOf the three names mentioned, “Doug Burgum is not only the safe pick, but also gives him some advantage in that he’s got a successful governor, who’s the governor of the second-largest energy producing state in the union,” Rove explained.\n“If you want to make energy an issue in the campaign, who better than that? But I’m with Josh. I think we’re — we got to think about Donald Trump as not just simply the former president and potentially future president the United States, but the executive producer of The Apprentice ,” he said, explaining there “may be a couple of twists and turns before this thing is all done.”\nHis remarks come as all eyes largely move to Sen. Vance, particularly following the news that Donald Trump Jr. is slated to speak right before Trump’s running mate at the convention on Wednesday. It is widely known that Don Jr. is friends with Vance and has openly stated that the senator is his top choice for his father’s running mate.\n“If we’re talking the VP stakes, what are you guys thinking right now?” Don Jr. asked during a recent episode of his podcast, Triggered . “You know, everyone knows, I’ve sort of been for J.D. Vance.”\nHe also shared a clip of Vance speaking recently, encouraging people to watch it.\n“Stop what you’re doing and watch this right now if you want to know what America First is all about,” he remarked:\nStop what you're doing and watch this right now if you want to know what America First is all about🔥\n“America is not just an idea. America is a nation. America is a group of people with a common history and a common future.” – @JDVance1 pic.twitter.com/1zQEv9u1Mm\n— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2024\nNotably, last month, Burgum made it clear that he believes Trump can win “regardless of who is vice president.”\n“I think if we actually look in political history, the last time a vice-president pick actually helped swing an election was when Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson and Lyndon Johnson help Kennedy win that race,” he said.\n“And with President Trump, right now, where he is with Hispanics, with blacks, with people under age 30 and with independents. I mean, he’s very strong across the board. So he can pick someone that you can focus on like, ‘Hey, let’s, let’s get someone gets stuff done.’ Let’s get someone who helps him govern,” he added.\n2024 Election Politics Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr. Doug Burgum J.D.

    "text": "By John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas took at least three additional trips funded by billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow that the conservative justice failed to disclose, the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee said on Thursday.\nCrow, a Texas businessman and Republican donor, disclosed details about the justice's travel between 2017 and 2021 in response to a Judiciary Committee vote last November to authorize subpoenas to Crow and Leonard Leo, another influential conservative figure, according to Senator Dick Durbin.\nThomas has previously come under criticism for failing to disclose gifts from Crow. Thomas on June 7 revised his 2019 financial disclosure form to acknowledge that Crow paid for his \"food and lodging\" at a Bali hotel and at a California club.\nBut the filing by Thomas failed to disclose that Crow had paid for his travel by private jet related to the Bali and California trips, and an eight-day excursion on a yacht in Indonesia - omissions revealed on Thursday in a redacted document that Durbin's office said contained travel itineraries for which Crow had provided the justice with transportation.\nThe document shows private jet travel in May 2017 between St. Louis, Montana and Dallas; private jet travel in March 2019 between Washington and Savannah, Georgia; and private jet travel in June 2021 between Washington and San Jose, California.\nCrow reached an agreement to provide information requested by the committee dating back seven years, Crow spokesperson Michael Zona said. As a condition of this, the committee agreed to end its probe into Crow, Zona added.\n\"Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the committee from the beginning to resolve the matter,\" Zona said.\nA Supreme Court spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\"The Senate Judiciary Committee's ongoing investigation into the Supreme Court's ethical crisis is producing new information - like what we've revealed (Thursday) - and makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,\" Durbin said.\nUnder pressure from criticism over ethics, the Supreme Court last November adopted its first code of conduct.\nCritics and some congressional Democrats have said the code does not go far enough to promote transparency, continuing to leave decisions to recuse from cases to the justices themselves and providing no mechanism of enforcement.\nSupreme Court's Clarence Thomas took additional trips paid for by benefactor, senator says",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Giles County, Virginia from 1901-2000 was 33.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Giles County, Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Giles County, Virginia history.",

    "text": "No. 9 Missouri's surprising season ended with a 14-3 win over a declawed No. 7 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl Classic on Friday, setting up the program for its first top 10 finish since 2013. To say the game was a slog would be generous. Only one drive in the first half ended in something other than a punt, when Ohio State turned some generous field position into a 44-yard field goal. The two teams combined for 183 yards total, averaging 2.8 yards per play. Ohio State entered the game shorthanded on offense, missing starting quarterback Kyle McCord and Heisman Trophy finalist Marvin Harrison Jr., then lost back-up quarterback Devin Brown to an injury in the first quarter. Third-stringer Lincoln Kienholz, who had attempted five passes total this season entering bowl season, took over. It was almost jarring when Missouri broke the ice at the end of the third quarter. Quarterback Brady Cook hit a wide-open Marquis Johnson on play action for 50 yards to go from deep in the Tigers' territory to the red zone. Before that, Missouri's longest play had been for 17 yards, It was only the second time the Ohio State defense allowed a play of 40+ yards all season and set up what wound up being the decisive score. The Buckeyes responded with one of their best drives of the game, but a Kienholz fumble ended it at the Mizzou 35. The Tigers responded with a 13-play, 91-yard drive to put the game away.",

    "text": "Hugo Modarelli: “La gente de Bahía y sus trabajadores se mostraron solidarios” El secretario general de ATSA, filial Bahía Blanca, resaltó el compromiso de todos los sectores y de los profesionales de la salud. “Se fue otro año donde todos los trabajadores de la Sanidad volvieron a mostrarse solidarios ante la adversidad. Nuestra ciudad, recientemente, pasó por un momento muy duro por razones climáticas y un temporal que arrasó con todo lo que tenía enfrente. Se perdieron vidas, algo que se lamentará eternamente, y también se contabilizaron daños materiales difíciles de afrontar. Ante todo ese panorama los Hospitales y las clínicas respondieron con el ya reconocido esmero de todos sus profesionales\". El mensaje de Hugo Modarelli, secretario general de la Asociación de Trabajadores de la Sanidad Argentina, va más allá de los afiliados al gremio e involucra a todos los ciudadanos de Bahía Blanca y los distritos lindantes. \"El esfuerzo fue de todos. Gente común solidarizándose con el vecino y colaborando con lo que tenían a su alcance; como también aquellos que aportaron herramientas o trabajo, conocedores de sus oficios, para aliviar la situación de personas que se quedaron sin techo o, directamente, sin sus hogares. También resultó sumamente valiosa presencia del gobernador Axel Kicillof y el aporte del intendente Federico Susbielles al frente de Defensa Civil en un trabajo a destajo en cada rincón de la ciudad; y ni hablar de los bomberos, ambulancias y quienes contribuyeron desde otras localidades o ciudades con aportes solidarios o arribando para dar una mano, como sucedió con la reparación del tendido eléctrico\". Modarelli también se refirió a la solidaridad expuesta por los trabajadores de la salud. \"Hubo profesionales como médicos y enfermeros que arriesgaron su vida en el momento más complicado, cuando la tormenta causó estragos, por el sólo hecho de llegar cuanto antes a su lugar de trabajo y cumplir con el cometido de ayudar a quién lo necesitaba. Para todos ellos, e incluyó a todo el personal de la salud, mis más sincero agradecimiento\", dijo. \"Cabe resaltar, como lo hago cada vez que expongo como secretario general de ATSA Bahía Blanca, que el gremio está a disposición de quienes necesiten nuestra ayuda\", puntualizó Modarelli. \"Por último un mensaje de solidaridad y amor para que este 2024 que ya se inicia nos encuentre mucho más unidos y mejor en todos los aspectos, con trabajo y salud, pero por sobre todas las cosas con una ciudad de pie\", concluyó Hugo Modarelli, secretario general de la Asociación de Trabajadores de la Sanidad, Bahía Blanca.",
