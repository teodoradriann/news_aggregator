    "text": "HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (WCYB) — The Metro-Nashville community welcomed its first Safe Haven Baby Box in Hendersonville this week, the sixth one installed in Tennessee. Safe Haven has baby boxes installed at designated fire stations and hospitals in 16 states across the country. The boxes act as a resource to parents in crisis, allowing them to anonymously surrender their baby. Baby Boxes have signage posted in both English and Spanish , explaining that the resource is only accessed by those in need of service. It also informs parents that a silent alarm will activate alerting first responders or medical professionals to a surrendered baby. A 24-hour crisis line is listed on each box, which parents in crisis can call for free counseling and assistance free of charge. According to the organizations [home page](https://www.shbb.org/), the resource is designed to raise awareness of the [Safe Haven Law](Safe Haven Law), which allows parents to surrender babies without fear of prosecution. You can find a video explaining more about how the Safe Haven Baby Boxes work below. Currently there are six baby boxes in Tennessee. Virginia does not currently have any baby boxes according to Safe Haven. A list of Tennessee locations can be found below. - Clinton Fire Station #2: 246 Hiway Drive, Clinton, TN 37716 - Hendersonville Fire Station #5: 1166 Forest Retreat Road, Hendersonville, TN, 37075 - Jackson Fire Station: 550 Westwood Avenue 38301, Jackson , TN 38301 - Kingston Fire Station #1: 125 W Cumberland Street, Kingston, TN 37763 - Knoxville Fire Station #17: 4804 Western Avenue, Knoxville, TN 37921 - Rural Metro Fire Station: 7401 Lena Lane, Knoxville, TN 37918",

    "text": "“`html\nBird Flu Detected in Indoor Cats in Michigan\nBird Flu Detected in Indoor Cats in Michigan, Raising Concerns About Potential Human Transmission Two indoor cats from separate households in Michigan have tragically died after contracting the H5N1 avian influenza virus, recently reported in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These cases raise significant concerns about the potential for H5N1 to spread from birds to pets and perhaps to humans, especially given the cats’ lack of exposure to wild birds.\nthe first case involved a 5-year-old female cat from a household with three indoor cats. The cat exhibited lethargy, disorientation, and loss of appetite before being euthanized due to rapid disease progression. Testing confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus in the cat’s brain and nasal swabs. The cat’s owner, who worked on a dairy farm with known H5N1 infections in cattle, reported experiencing vomiting and diarrhea a day before the cat’s symptoms began. While the owner declined testing, the timing of the symptoms suggests a possible connection.\nIn a separate incident, a 6-month-old male cat from another Michigan household also succumbed to H5N1. This cat, also an exclusively indoor pet, developed neurological symptoms, facial swelling, and stopped eating before dying within 24 hours. Its owner, who transported unpasteurized milk from various farms, reported experiencing eye irritation two days before the cat became ill. This cat frequently rolled in the owner’s clothes, while another cat in the household did not.\n“Because neither dairy worker received testing for A(H5), weather cat 1A’s owner’s gastrointestinal symptoms or cat 2A’s owner’s ocular symptoms were because of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or a different etiology is unknown,” the MMWR notes.\nThese cases highlight the growing concern about the potential for H5N1 to spread beyond birds and into other animal species, including humans. While the risk to human health remains low at this time, the CDC recommends taking precautions, such as avoiding contact with sick birds and wearing protective gear when handling poultry or animal feed. Individuals who experience flu-like symptoms after potential exposure to H5N1 should seek medical attention immediately.\nWhat steps can pet owners take too protect their animals from contracting bird flu?\nCould Bird Flu Spread to Humans? Dive into an Expert Interview Interview with Dr. Emily Hartfield, Veterinary Epidemiologist at the CDC In a shocking revelation, two indoor cats from separate households in Michigan have died after contracting the H5N1 avian influenza, raising grave concerns about the potential spread of bird flu to pets and even humans. We sat down with Dr. Emily Hartfield, a veterinary epidemiologist at the CDC, to discuss these recent developments and their implications.\nDr. Hartfield, could you start by explaining how these indoor cats contracted bird flu without exposure to wild birds? “While it’s unusual, it’s not impossible,” Dr. Hartfield explained. “In both cases, the cats’ owners were occupationally exposed to the virus – one on a dairy farm with H5N1 infections in cattle, the other by transporting unpasteurized milk. Even though the owners didn’t test positive, it’s possible they indirectly transmitted the virus to their cats. Human-to-pet transmission is a worrying newdevelopment.”\nCould this virus spread to humans more easily in the future? “That’s one of our primary concerns,” Dr. hartfield noted. “Right now, the risk of H5N1 to humans remains low. But as we’ve seen with other viruses, they can evolve and mutate, potentially gaining the ability to spread easily among mammals, including humans. We must be vigilant and prepared.”\nwhat should pet owners and farmers do to protect their animals and themselves? “First, avoid contact with sick birds, and wear protective gear when handling poultry or animal feed. Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling animals or their environments. If you’re a farmer, implement strict biosecurity measures to protect your animals and minimize the risk of infection. And if you’re a pet owner who experiences flu-like symptoms after possible exposure,consult a healthcare provider instantly.”\nHow can we, as a society, better prepare for and mitigate emerging zoonotic diseases like H5N1? “we need to invest in enhanced surveillance, both in animals and humans, to quickly detect and respond to new threats. Collaboration between veterinary and human medical professionals is crucial. Additionally, supporting environmentally enduring agriculture practices can help reduce the risk of virus spillover from wildlife to livestock and humans. It’s a complex issue, but with collective effort, we can boost our readiness and response to emerging diseases.”\nAs these alarming cases of bird flu in indoor cats highlight, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission is a pressing concern. With experts like Dr. Hartfield guiding our response, we can heighten our vigilance and mitigate the risks that emerging pathogens pose to our pets and ourselves.",

    "text": "Fall River's Temple Beth El will be put up for sale. It's the city's last synagogue. [Dan Medeiros](/staff/5917128002/dan-medeiros/) FALL RIVER — [The city’s Jewish community](/story/news/2019/03/29/fall-river-wonders-what-is/5585559007/) is losing its last place of worship. According to a message from Stephen Silverman, president of [Congregation Beth El,](https://www.frtemplebethel.org/) the congregation has “come to a crossroads” and must sell its synagogue at 385 High St. The congregation itself will continue. The move comes after years of decline in the number of congregants and the rising expense of maintaining Temple Beth El, a large, aging building. \"It wasn’t so long ago that we would see at least 200 people at our High Holiday services,” Silverman wrote. “This year, there were 30. Even including those who watched the livestream, the total didn’t reach 50, in a sanctuary that seats 650.” Fall River Wonders: [What is the history of Fall River's Jewish community?](/story/news/2019/03/29/fall-river-wonders-what-is/5585559007/) The congregation is currently led by husband and wife [Rabbi Mark Elber](/story/lifestyle/features/2022/11/04/fall-river-rabbi-mark-elber-wins-morgenthau-prize-for-poetry-book/69600739007/) and Cantor Shoshana Brown. Elber and Brown were not immediately available for comment. Silverman said the congregation’s board decided unanimously to find a broker to sell the Temple Beth El building and possibly to find a new home for the congregants. Silverman wrote that the board is looking to move quickly so there’s no lapse in continuity. “Our primary duty is to keep Congregation Beth El viable well into the future,” Silverman wrote. “As we are the last vestige of Judaism in the greater Fall River area, keeping the congregation alive is more important than ever.” Declining Jewish congregation can't sustain building expenses The building was constructed in 1929, during what Bristol Community College professor and historian Ron Weisberger said was the start of a high point in the city’s Jewish population. “Our 95-year-old temple has numerous building maintenance problems, some of which would require a major investment to correct,” Silverman wrote. “We have already spent 55% of our annual maintenance budget in the first three months of this fiscal year. During the High Holidays, we had to put three buckets in the vestibule to catch water dripping from one of the towers.” He wrote in his email that, at the rate of spending on maintenance, the congregation’s endowment will run dry in five years. A labor of love: [Fall River rabbi wins prize for his first book of poetry](/story/lifestyle/features/2022/11/04/fall-river-rabbi-mark-elber-wins-morgenthau-prize-for-poetry-book/69600739007/) Though [People Incorporated](https://peopleincfr.org/services/preschool/) leases space from the building for its preschool program, providing nearly half of the congregation’s annual revenue, that lease is set to expire in 2025 and will not be renewed. That loss of income will, Silverman wrote, hasten the loss of the endowment. The temple building is on [Fall River's list of significant structures](https://www.fallriverma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fall-River-Register-of-Significant-Structures-JULY-2017.pdf), and is listed with the state's Historical Commission. The last of Fall River's Jewish temples Records show at one time Fall River hosted seven or possibly as many as 12 synagogues. Temple Beth El reached its peak of activity in the 1950s, with 600 families attending services and its own bowling league, Braille class, scout troops and an educational lecture series that covered topics like Thomas Aquinas, the weather, Confucius, Sigmund Freud and Thomas Jefferson. In 2012, the orthodox Congregation Adas Israel on Robeson Street sold its building to an evangelical Christian church, leaving Temple Beth El the last synagogue in the city. Weisberger said most of the Jews that came to Fall River were immigrants, whose children moved away for college and didn’t come back. “That left a much older population,” he said. Silverman wrote that the average congregant’s age is between 75 and 80 years old. Without Temple Beth El, the closest conservative synagogue is Tifareth Israel in New Bedford. United Brothers in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Temple Habonim in Barrington, Rhode Island, are reform synagogues. “There was this very rich, vibrant Jewish community in Fall River, and it declined over the years,\" Weisberger said. “It’s one of the stories of Fall River but also of the Jewish community in the country, which has demographically shifted. “This is the last of the synagogues, which is to my mind very sad.” Dan Medeiros can be reached at [dmedeiros@heraldnews.com](mailto:dmedeiros@heraldnews.com).
