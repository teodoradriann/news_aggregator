    "text": "G7 summit won't adopt joint communique due to differences over Ukraine – Bloomberg\nMariia Spaliek\nThe G7 countries will not try to reach consensus on a joint communiqué at the leaders' summit, which will be held June 15-17 in Canada. This decision was made due to significant differences with the United States on a number of issues, in particular, the Russian-Ukrainian war. Bloomberg reports this, citing unnamed interlocutors familiar with the discussions on this topic.\nAccording to the agency's interlocutors, instead of a single document, the G7 leaders will likely publish separate joint statements by leaders on various topics. The summit is scheduled to discuss global trade, artificial intelligence, energy security, forest fires and global military conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nAs Bloomberg notes, agreeing on a final communiqué is usually a ritual for leaders who gather at meetings such as the G7 summit. While the document has no legal force, it is a statement of principles and is designed to demonstrate unity among participants on issues of global importance.\nFor example, the communiqué from last year's summit was 36 pages long and contained promises to support Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, combat climate change, and promote gender equality.\nBut US President Donald Trump has reversed US policy on all these issues and many others, refusing to express support for Ukraine in favor of Russia, canceling climate change initiatives, and rejecting gender initiatives.\nIn addition to the fact that agreeing on a common position with the US on these issues will be extremely difficult, even a signed document does not guarantee a permanent position of the leaders. In 2018, after the G7 summit, which was also hosted by Canada, Trump withdrew from the joint communique a few hours after signing it, because he was irritated by comments made to reporters by then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n- President Zelensky will join the G7 summit along with the leaders of India, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries.\n- Ukraine\nexpects that at the G7 summitin Canada, the heads of state of the \"Big Seven\" will make a decision to lower the price ceiling for Russian oil, confiscate Moscow's frozen assets in favor of Kyiv, and strengthen the isolation of the aggressor country.",

Segundo alerta da Defesa Civil Nacional, a situação deve seguir crítica até domingo, 24. No litoral de São Paulo e no estado do Rio de Janeiro o acumulado de chuvas pode ultrapassar 100 milímetros por dia.\nAs localidades que mais preocupam, destacadas em coletiva de imprensa realizada na noite desta quinta-feira, 21, são a região metropolitana, o Vale do Paraíba e o litoral norte do estado de São Paulo, assim como o Sul e a Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais.\nAlém disso, a atenção também está voltada ao Rio de Janeiro, que deve ser o mais atingido pelo temporal. Há previsão de até 200 mm de chuva em 24 horas no estado -- sendo que a média de março, segundo a série história, é de 124,7 mm.\nPor conta do alerta de temporal, o prefeito do Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, decretou ponto facultativo nesta sexta-feira, 22. A recomendação é que se evitem deslocamentos desnecessários e que a população fique em casa – ou em locais considerados seguros.\n“Vamos observar as próximas 48 horas, 72 horas. Mas vamos ficar atentos. A rua a gente limpa, bem material recupera depois, mas o importante é sair desse suposto momento de crise mais aguda, que possamos sair com vidas preservadas e que serviço público trabalhe de forma adequada”, afirmou Paes na madrugada desta sexta.\nSegurança\nO Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet) reforça dicas de seguranças para a população destas regiões:\n- Desligue aparelhos elétricos e quadro geral de energia.\n- Em caso de enxurrada ou similar, coloque documentos e objetos de valor em sacos plásticos.\n- Em caso de situação de grande perigo confirmada: Procure abrigo, evite permanecer ao ar livre.\n- Obtenha mais informações junto à Defesa Civil (telefone 199) e ao Corpo de Bombeiros (telefone 193).",

    "text": "GARY — Bishop Robert J. McClory of the Catholic Diocese of Gary ordained Deacons Steven Caraher, 28, and Zach Glick, 29, to the priesthood Saturday at Holy Angels Cathedral. “I really just met Jesus in the Eucharist, and that changed my whole life,” said Glick. “I got into Eucharistic adoration and I learned more about life with God.” Caraher’s faith journey started during Bible study between his sophomore and junior years in college. “That totally changed my life, and I really felt called to be a priest,” he said, adding, “I said ‘yes’ six years ago, and here we are today.” Caraher remembers “feeling awkward and stiff” when he first approached preaching but believes his opportunities at Sunday Masses during the past year have improved his preaching, feeling amazed at “how clearly the Lord speaks.” People are also reading… Growing up, Glick considered joining the U.S. military, especially while pursuing an engineering degree at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Having discerned a vocation to the priesthood, Glick found a way to blend his aspirations. After three years with the Gary diocese, he will begin a five-year commitment to the U.S. Air Force, serving as a military chaplain, where he is eager to “bring the Mass and other sacraments to Catholics who might otherwise not have access to baptism and the anointing of the sick.” As the new priest explained. “We serve not only the enlisted, but their families, too.” Caraher attended Munster High School and Indiana University before attending St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary in Illinois. He earned a philosophy degree from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit. While at IU, Caraher earned degrees in math and computer science, with a minor in theatre. Glick graduated from Highland High School and Rose-Hulman with bachelor and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering. After attending Mundelein Seminary, he earned a philosophy degree from Sacred Heart. As a new priest, Caraher said he is looking forward to hearing confessions, especially with someone who hasn’t been to confession for 30-40 years. “It doesn’t matter how far we’ve strayed from Him; He is so ready to forgive us, and I will get to say those words,” Caraher said. The Munster native is looking forward to celebrating his first Mass at 10 a.m. Sunday at his home parish and hearing confessions. “St. Thomas More is the place that nourished me during my childhood,” Caraher said, “and it will be a really special moment for my first Mass with my family and friends there.” Caraher’s pastor, the Rev. Michael Yadron, said a special song taken from the new priest’s favorite prayer will be performed at that Mass. “Steven is multi-talented and very much a people person,” Yadron said. “He can speak the Gospel in a year people find easy to embrace.” Caraher’s first priestly assignment, effective July 1, will be as associate pastor at Holy Martyrs Parish and Our Lady of Consolation, both in Merrillville. Glick will be associate pastor at Queen of All Saints and St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception, both in Michigan City. Glick looks forward to meeting people’s spiritual needs through counseling and ministering. “Listening is important as we practice imitating Christ as deacons, facilitating personal interaction with Jesus,” Glick explained. “People need to know they are heard and understood by someone who cares.” Glick’s first Mass will be at 2 p.m. Sunday at Our Lady of Grace in Highland with his family and friends. He noted, “I think my six years of seminary has been a blessing for my family because they have grown in their faith and been very supportive and happy for me.” During their time in the seminary, both new priests served during the summer of 2021 with the homeless in Michigan City as volunteers in the Christ in the City program. Living with 8-10 people, they served the homeless at a food pantry and shelter. Caraher recalled having butterflies when he was ordained a deacon last year, “but I am looking forward to entering into the liturgy and being committed in a deeper way now.” He added, “When the bishop rubs the Holy Chrism on my hands, it means my hands are being consecrated to consecrate the Eucharist.” The ordination rite begins with the candidates being presented to the bishop, who questions them about their intentions. The candidates lie prostrate as a sign of humility, after which the bishop silently lays his hands on them, followed by other priests doing the same. The newly-ordained are vested with the stole and chasuble. The bishop then anoints the hands of each candidate, after which he and other priests share the sign of peace with the new priests. Glick admits to being somewhat anxious “about unexpected situations I’ll come across in my ministry, but you just need to think on your feet.” Glick is the younger of two sons to Marc and Joann Glick. Caraher is the oldest of four adult children to P.J. and Joann Caraher. Both sets of parents said their felt “blessed and proud” by their sons’ decision to become priests. McClory called the ordination a “joyous occasion” for the diocese. In his homily, McClory described ordination as “a configuration of Christ’s consecration that (the ordained) are set aside with that which is sacred. You’re not just given a job. You’re given an identity in Jesus Christ.” McClory, who this year marked 25 years as a priest, called the priesthood a “joyful, vibrant, life-giving way to live.” The Gary diocese will hold two ordinations this month. Next Saturday at the cathedral, McClory will ordain 14 men to the diaconate. That includes 12 permanent deacons, in addition to two transitional deacons, who are on track to be ordained to the priesthood in 2025.",
