    "title": "Unprecedented Warmth in Srinagar: January Records Highest Temperature in Two Decades | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "New Delhi: On Saturday, Srinagar in Kashmir registered a maximum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, marking the highest January temperature in the past two decades. The Kashmir Valley is witnessing a notable departure from its usual weather patterns, experiencing a significant 100% deficit in snowfall for the month of January. Prolonged dry spells, devoid of snowfall in the plains of Kashmir, have resulted in temperatures rising 6 to 8 degrees Celsius above normal at many locations in the valley. The mercury levels exceed those observed in most northern parts of the country. In response to these unusual weather patterns, the weather department noted that sudden temperature changes have become common in recent times, a phenomenon also observed during the summer season. However, there is optimism in the expectation of a fresh western disturbance that may impact Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days, potentially bringing the first snowfall of the season, according to weather experts. The delay in snowfall is posing a threat to winter sports in the region, including skiing, snowboarding, and cross-country skiing. This delay has adversely affected tourism in the valley, as winter sports activities scheduled for January have taken a backseat. Even in the renowned hill resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir, typically covered in snow at this time of year, winter sports have been impacted. The dry spell has led to the cancellation of hotel bookings, particularly in Gulmarg, which traditionally attracts a significant number of tourists during the winter season.

    "text": "MIAMI GARDENS — Tua Tagovailoa's workload dropped from a couple of handoffs on Wednesday to total spectator on Thursday. Tagovailoa, hoping to reach agreement with the Miami Dolphins on a contract extension, spent the second practice day of training camp in a No. 1 jersey but without his helmet. He did not take part in either individual or team drills. More: Miami Dolphins' Jalen Ramsey challenges Anthony Weaver to make him ‘chess piece' Tagovailoa is staging a \"hold in,\" which is similar to a holdout except he reported to camp and often works on a limited basis. Or, to be more accurate, he was working on a limited basis until Thursday. The reason he didn't practice Thursday wasn't immediately known because coach Mike McDaniel won't address the media again until Friday. Most likely, it was contract-related. Although much less likely, it's also possible he has a minor injury. At any rate, Tagovailoa joined teammates on the practice field in his traditional red, noncontact No. 1 jersey, but with a baseball cap. He chatted with QB coach Darrell Bevell. Not having Tagovailoa meant more opportunities for the other QBs in camp: Mike White, Skylar Thompson and Gavin Hardison. Dolphins reporter Hal Habib can be reached at hhabib@pbpost.com .

El comisionado para la Paz, Otty Patiño, se refirió a los diálogos que avanzan con la guerrilla del ELN y aseguro que esperan que el Congreso Nacional que adelantará este grupo armado, permita que internamente lleguen a acuerdos que faciliten el avance de las conversaciones del Gobierno Nacional con esa estructura. El comisionado dijo esperar que en esa reunión que se realizará para abordar asuntos nacionales del grupo armado, acuerden convertir los diferentes frentes de guerra que tienen presencia en varias zonas del país, en frentes de paz, que apoyen el cese del conflicto armado.

Patiño resaltó que actualmente hay algunos puntos de diálogos regionales, como es el caso del departamento de Nariño, en donde los frentes del ELN adelanta conversaciones con las comunidades para buscar el cese de los enfrentamientos en esa zona del país.

Y está muy ligado al proceso constituyente. En Nariño hay un proceso constituyente que está muy ligado a las aspiraciones de paz allá en el territorio. (…) Y de alguna manera, Nariño va, digamos, en una posición de vanguardia”, añadió el comisionado. El funcionario además explicó que esos procesos son coordinados por las comunidades de esa región, pero aclaró que no se trata de nuevas mesas, ya que solo existe una mesa nacional, pero que hay diálogos locales que están articulados con las conversaciones adelantadas en la mesa de diálogo. “La mesa, como se dice, es nacional, pero desde luego hay procesos, hay instancias, hay equipos de trabajo que seguramente se seguirán dando en un proceso que es inevitable, que siga avanzando, en el cual ellos participarán en las transformaciones de ese territorio y, desde luego, en la transformación de su propia vida”, concluyó el comisionado. El nuevo ciclo de negociación entre el Gobierno Nacional y el ELN se realizará entre el 20 y el 25 de mayo en Caracas (Venezuela).",

    "text": "Author: Chris McMillan ( MENAFN - The Conversation) The recently concluded men's Cricket World Cup in India reached record audiences . But there was one thing the organisers did not want those viewers to see (other than India's defeat by Australia in the final): cricket's own climate crisis.\nAlong with battling heat and humidity, players were forced to contend with unhealthy air created by pollutants from vehicles, factories and construction, and aggravated by increased temperatures in 20 of the 47 matches.\nAs Indian captain Rohit Sharma remarked ,“It is not ideal and everyone knows that.”\nThe United Nations describes the threat more forcefully. Secretary-General António Guterres has warned the world is on a“catastrophic path” to a“hellish future”. It is a future that threatens the very viability of cricket.\nNew Zealand versus India semi-final at the ODI World Cup: poor air quality affected 20 out 47 matches. Getty Images Cricket and the climate Crisis As an outdoor summer game in which the natural environment plays a unique role, cricket is perhaps the pitch sport most at risk from a changing climate.\nIncreased temperatures and heat waves threaten the safety of players and spectators, as well as the preparation and maintenance of playing surfaces.\nEqually, cricket is vulnerable to higher risks of drought and flooding. Air pollution, especially in the Indian subcontinent, continues to cloud the game.\nRead more: Time for a reckoning: Cricket Australia, fossil fuel sponsorship and climate change\nThe threat is compounded by the precarious regions in which cricket is played. Bangladesh and Pakistan – where New Zealand's Black Caps played their past two overseas Test series – are ranked seventh and eighth respectively for vulnerability on the Climate Risk Index .\nAt the same time, cricket is not merely a potential victim of the climate crisis, it is a contributor to it.\nWhile it lags behind other sports in calculating its environmental impact, cricket is a resource-heavy game. Preparation of a cricket field requires around 60,000 litres of water a day. An expanding international touring schedule means regular long-haul flights.\nOne of the few existing studies estimated an Indian Premier League match produced about 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Overall, cricket's carbon footprint is substantial.\nRead more: Heat risk and young athletes - rising temperatures lead to lawsuits and environmental injustice\nSport and Sustainability For a game facing a potential existential crisis, cricket's sustainability efforts have been slow by comparison with other sports.\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the International Olympic Committee has committed to a 50% reduction in direct and indirect carbon emissions by 2030, and promised the 2032 Brisbane Olympics will be“climate positive”.\nBoth FIFA and World Rugby have sustainability plans, as do Formula One and most American sports leagues, including the NBA . Sail GP even has an“Impact League” that measures environmental mitigation efforts.\nRead more: Rising costs of climate change threaten to make skiing a less diverse, even more exclusive sport\nWhile some scepticism might be warranted – FIFA held a World Cup in oil-rich Qatar, and the 2030 men's tournament will be held across two continents – at least the intent is clear.\nBy contrast, the International Cricket Council has not published a sustainability strategy. Of its full members, only the England and Wales Cricket Board has such a plan.\nOf the more than 200 sporting organisations to sign up to the UN's Sports for Climate Action Framework – which requires participants to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2040 – only six are cricketing entities, and most are in England.\nFlooding in some parts of New Zealand halved the number of scheduled cricket fixtures in early 2023. Getty Images Inaction in New Zealand New Zealand Cricket (NZC) is as silent on climate as many of its global counterparts. Environmental sustainability does not appear in NZC strategy documents.\nAt the same time, its 2022-23 annual report laments that less than half of all scheduled recreational fixtures could be played in some areas due to rain and flooding. It also notes the“cyclones, floods and related civil emergencies” that caused these cancellations were“well beyond its control”.\nNew Zealand's 2023-24 cricket season could be the hottest yet . Following the devastating floods in Auckland in early 2023, a drought is possible this summer . Heat waves are becoming more persistent and more dangerous.\nCricket is not made for such extremes. At a time when game is struggling to attract participants , climate change is making it harder for recreational cricketers to play.\nNew Zealand Cricket's mission statement states:\nIt may be time to apply those admirable sentiments to its response to the climate crisis. The first step would be to sign up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework – and get some sustainability runs on the board.\nMENAFN28122023000199003603ID1107666846\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.
