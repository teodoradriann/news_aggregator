    "text": "Israeli soldiers work to repair tanks amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, near the Israel-Gaza border, in southern Israel, December 28, 2023. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",

    "text": "HARBIN -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, renowned for its rich forest resources, has launched a forestry carbon-sink trading system, as part of the country's broader efforts to achieve its dual carbon goals.\n\"As the first provincial-level forestry carbon-sink trading system initiated by forestry and grassland authorities, it provides a good reference for forestry carbon-sink trading efforts in other provinces,\" said Guo Qingjun, an official of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, at the launch ceremony on Wednesday.\nA carbon sink is anything that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases, and forests are typically carbon sinks.\nHeilongjiang boasts a forest area of 20.12 million hectares, accounting for 8.7 percent of China's total and ranking third in the country. The province's local forest ecosystem has a carbon reserve of about 5.7 billion tonnes.\nIn addition to Heilongjiang, provinces such as Fujian, Guangdong and Shandong have also adopted forestry carbon sink practices to promote green transformation.\nChina has set ambitious goals of achieving a carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, taking a prominent role in the global fight against climate change.\n\"The development of forestry carbon-sink projects not only enhances the ecological environment but also increases the supply of ecological products and services, fostering a positive interaction between ecological protection and economic development,\" said Li Jian, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\nForestry carbon-sink trading is one of many approaches China is taking to pursue a green path, demonstrating the country's steadfast commitment to ecological priorities and low-carbon development.\nIn line with the dual carbon goals, China has made unwavering efforts to develop its carbon trading market. It has piloted carbon emission trading in multiple regions since 2011 to explore market-based mechanisms to control greenhouse gas emissions. A national carbon emission trading market was officially launched in 2021.\nAs of Wednesday, the cumulative volume of carbon emission allowances in the national carbon market stood at about 465 million tonnes, with the turnover amounting to nearly 27 billion yuan (about 3.79 billion U.S. dollars), according to data.\nIn July, China's tropical island province of Hainan saw the transaction of the country's first-ever carbon-sink trading project located in a national park's tropical rainforest.\nThree companies have signed a cooperation agreement with the Diaoluo Mountain branch of the Management Office of the National Park of Hainan Tropical Rainforest for the purchase of a total of 350,000 yuan worth of tropical rainforest carbon sinks, according to the provincial forestry department.\nThe carbon sinks traded originate from the Diaoluo Mountain area of the national park, where Merremia boisiana, a vigorous invasive vine harmful to trees, was removed from 667 hectares of forest.\nThe removal of the vines will help accelerate the growth of trees, resulting in an estimated reduction of 109,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 20 years, with the carbon-sink trading value exceeding 10 million yuan.\nThe three companies purchased carbon sinks for 150,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan, respectively, to offset their carbon emissions and contribute to carbon neutrality.\nAccording to Niu Guimin, a researcher at the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, promoting diversified carbon trading varieties and methods is considered a prevailing trend.\n\"Environmental protection and afforestation are China's contributions to the world. Initiatives like forestry carbon-sink trading reveal a promising future where the integration of ecological value and economic value becomes apparent,\" Niu said.",

    "text": "(CNN) — When news broke that a top aide to Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was joining former President Donald Trump’s campaign last month, Trump advisers were livid, believing the aide was promoting himself, without permission of the campaign’s top brass. Senior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita called the newest team member, Brian Swenson, and “ripped into him,” according to two sources familiar with the conversation. The message was clear: If you want to keep your job, stop running your mouth, the source said. Swenson did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The episode was indicative of how Trump’s 2024 team has sought to focus the messaging and the media that surrounds the chaotic world of the front-runner for the GOP nomination. His team is viewed by both outside political operatives and current and former Trump officials as his most disciplined to date. Led by seasoned Republican strategists LaCivita and Susie Wiles, the team has sought to prevent the kinds of internal leaks that were ever-present during 2016 and throughout Trump’s presidency from damaging the former president as he seeks to regain the White House. “They know they aren’t able to control him, he will always say and do what he wants,” one source familiar with the team’s dynamic told CNN, noting that Trump is known to ignore prepared remarks and solicit outside advice from a wide net of allies, often without the knowledge of his closest advisers. “But they can try to control everyone around him.” The advisers who have spent the last year working to streamline his campaign’s messaging, however, have recently found themselves fighting an uphill battle. They’re attempting to navigate the wide span of Trump allies all itching to be a part of the action and leverage their ties to the former president in hopes of bolstering their influence in the months before the 2024 election. As Trump’s primary lead has grown, so has the interest in what a second Trump administration would look like – in both policy and personnel. A slew of recent media reports have speculated on potential vice presidential picks and Cabinet members, citing anonymous sources. “Nobody came out of the woodwork to say they wanted to be a Cabinet secretary 12 months ago when things were really dire and no one wanted to be associated with us,” a senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN, adding that the recent shift in the narrative around the former president has brought with it a surge in outside parties interested in joining a potential administration. Trump’s senior advisers were recently surprised and annoyed when they learned Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official, was telling Trump allies he was part of the vetting effort for a potential vice presidential pick, according to three senior advisers who adamantly denied his involvement. Patel, a Trump loyalist who climbed the ranks while Trump was in office, continues to hold sway with the former president and is widely viewed as someone who would likely serve in a national security capacity in a second administration. “I am not nor have I ever been involved with any vetting process. President Trump and the campaign are solely in charge,” Patel said in a statement to CNN. The frustration runs deep in the campaign. “When you’re trying to be disciplined and run a sophisticated campaign, it gets annoying when people who aren’t working on the campaign are creating headaches for the team,” a person close to Trump said. “They’re pissed people are running to reporters saying they’re in line for jobs that the Trump team hasn’t even discussed.” However, some of those headaches come from Trump himself. During a recent fundraiser, Trump began tossing names around for vice president, a source familiar with the conversations said. “Who do we like for VP?” the former president asked donors and allies before batting around names with the crowd — a story that was eventually shared with reporters. Trump 2025: Credit grabbing and calling out Since Trump left office, former administration officials created several organizations in Washington to continue the work of the administration and prepare for a potential second term — including vetting future Trump administration officials, writing policy proposals and drafting executive orders with the intention of putting them in front of Trump to sign on the day he would enter office. Additionally, Trump allies have also begun preparing for a possible Republican presidential transition through a collaboration of right-wing think tanks led by the Heritage Foundation — dubbed “Project 2025.” The groups recently entered the spotlight through a series of media stories on Trump’s agenda for a second term. Internal frustration over the coverage has grown within Trump’s inner circle, which has stressed that any official policy or personnel decisions will come from the campaign directly. One group in particular — the America First Policy Institute led by Brooke Rollins, the acting director of the US Domestic Policy Council under Trump — has drawn the team’s ire. Members of Trump’s campaign were furious when they learned the group had been touting their relationship with the former president and their efforts to build out his possible future administration, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN. Not only is the work not authorized by the campaign, these campaign team members argued, but they believe it is premature and did not appreciate AFPI quietly taking credit for something that was not in their purview. One senior Trump adviser took particular issue with AFPI’s personnel efforts. “They’re vetting people for a future Trump administration? Who? We have no insight into these people,” the campaign official said. Senior members of Trump’s campaign team made it clear to Rollins they did not appreciate the group exaggerating their ties to the campaign, three sources familiar with the exchange said. Shortly afterward, Wiles and LaCivita issued a rare statement that read: “reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical.” “Any personnel lists, policy agendas, or government plans published anywhere are merely suggestions,” the statement read, arguing that no outside groups have the authority to speak on behalf of Trump or his campaign. One source disputed this statement was directed at AFPI, insisting their officials were assured by multiple campaign officials the statement was not about that group. Marc Lotter, the chief communications officer for America First Policy Institute, pushed back on the existence of any friction between the former president and AFPI, calling it “fake news.” Lotter noted that Trump has “headlined a half dozen events for AFPI including our Hispanic leadership conference in Miami, his first return trip to Washington, DC, the big tech lawsuit, and three fundraising events at Mar-a-Lago, as recently as last month.” A source close to the former president made clear that Trump is still in touch with several members of AFPI’s team and routinely seeks their counsel. This includes Larry Kudlow, who served as his director of the National Economic Council, and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who serviced as a national security adviser to Mike Pence and whom Trump has recently consulted on foreign policy. Another source said Rollins herself still routinely talks to Trump. The statement from Wiles and LaCivita did little to prevent other outside entities and allies from leaking potential administration positions. A few weeks later, the pair fired off another warning shot: “Despite our being crystal clear, some ‘allies’ haven’t gotten the hint,” they wrote in a second statement. “Let us be even more specific, and blunt: People publicly discussing potential administration jobs for themselves or their friends are, in fact, hurting President Trump … and themselves. These are an unwelcomed distraction.” A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN the second statement was in response to an Axios story published the previous day laying out the names of people who could serve in a potential Trump Cabinet. It also followed an interview that Patel gave to Steve Bannon asserting that a future Trump administration would target journalists and attempt to “prosecute them for crimes” should Trump win the 2024 election. “We’re actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes,” Patel said. “Idiotic comments like this have nothing to do with our campaign,” a Trump campaign official told CNN after the Patel interview. Campaign officials have also downplayed how many outside voices Trump listens to. Earlier this month, Ric Grenell, Trump’s former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. A senior adviser to Trump attempted to discredit Grenell’s influence on the former president. However, a source familiar with the recent visit said that afterwards, Trump praised Grenell as someone he hoped would serve again in a future administration. Campaign takes grievances to Trump Trump himself has been irked with how some of his outside allies and aligned groups have been using his name, multiple sources said. Trump has long loathed when people are perceived to be profiting off him or using their ties to bolster their own careers. Last year, he was angry after dining with a major donor at his Mar-a-Lago club, when he learned that they had given roughly $1 million to AFPI. The donor told Trump at the time that they believed they were donating directly to a super PAC associated with Trump’s reelection campaign, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Following that dinner, Trump complained to several of his closest aides that the money should’ve gone to the campaign directly, and he remained annoyed about the encounter for several days, the sources said. In an effort to keep a lid on some of the growing speculation that now surrounds a possible second administration, the campaign has taken some of their concerns directly to the former president. “The campaign, we’re briefing him on the people who are doing this stuff on the outside. So do they want to risk playing games and having their name tarnished internally? Or do they want to sort of play by the rules and not mess around and try to actually help win a election,” a campaign adviser told CNN. However, one complication the campaign is grappling with is Trump’s innate preference to seek outside counsel from his friends and allies. As president, Trump often called up Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to take their temperature on ideas he was eager to roll out. As a candidate, Trump continues to call allies and former administration officials on topics ranging from how the campaign is doing to what he wants a possible second term to look like. The former president dines frequently with such allies — including those whose names have appeared in stories about serving in a future Trump Cabinet.",

    "text": "A partir de los primero días de mayo, el país se ha enfrentado a una intensa ola de calor, incluso en algunos estados se han alcanzado temperaturas de hasta los 45 grados Celsius. A la par, el Sistema Eléctrico Nacional se ha visto en dificultades en la reserva y generación de energía, resultado de dichas temperaturas.Según un comunicado del Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, las temperaturas elevadas provocaron un incremento en la demanda de energía eléctrica en los 32 estados del país, razón por la que hubo una significativa disminución en los niveles de reserva de energía. Esta situación desencadenó que el CENACE declarara Estado Operativo de Alerta durante tres días consecutivos. A su vez se realizó un llamado a la población a reducir su consumo eléctrico en las horas picos, con el objetivo de prevenir apagones y contribuir a que el sistema de suministro eléctrico se estabilice.Según estimaciones de CENACE, el problema en el suministro se agravó por la dependencia de la población hacia equipos de aire acondicionado y sistema de enfriamiento, ante las altas temperaturas. Al 10 de mayo, CONAGUA prevé que en estados como Sinaloa, Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz y otros, se presentarán temperaturas de hasta 45 °C. Mientras en Sonora, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Morelos, Puebla (norte y suroeste), Hidalgo (norte), Nuevo León y Quintana Roo, la temperatura máxima será de entre 40 y 45 °C. Esto dado que prevalece la segunda onda de calor sobre el territorio nacional.Por si fuera poco, la NASA y NOAA pronostican una tormenta solar severa para el 10 de mayo de 2024. Misma que podría interrumpir las comunicaciones, provocar problemas en las redes de energía eléctrica, navegación y en operaciones satelitales, durante los próximos días. El Centro de Predicción de Clima Espacial describe que desde el 8 de mayo, el Sol presentó erupciones solares y eyecciones de masa coronal, las cuales provocaron una tormenta geomagnética con dirección a la tierra.Cabe mencionar, las tormentas geomagnéticas, también llamadas tormentas solares, son perturbaciones en el campo electromagnético provocadas por el aumento brusco de partículas expulsadas por el sol. Estas pueden durar varios días o algunas horas, dependiendo de la intensidad de las erupciones solares. Además, tienen impacto global, comenzando simultáneamente en todos los puntos de la tierra, sin embargo, la amplitud de las afectaciones del campo magnético suelen ser mayores en latitudes de gran altura.De esta forma, aunque las autoridades mexicanas no se han pronunciado al respecto, es probable que, a nivel global, las comunicaciones por radio, las redes de energía eléctrica y las señales de navegación sufran afectaciones. Consecuencia de las recientes erupciones solares y la tormenta geomagnética con dirección a la tierra. Por otra parte, esto también podría provocar espectaculares vistas en el sur de Alabama y Norte de California. Pues este fenómeno espacial provoca que sean visibles auroras boreales con mayor intensidad en diversas latitudes. Mantente al día con las noticias, únete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp MC",

    "text": "Return to the Complex\nJulio Rodriguez has rejoined the training complex after spending the past several days sidelined by illness. After being scratched from the lineup on Monday and absent from games on Tuesday and Wednesday, he has been observed working in the batting cage at the facility. This return marks an important step in his gradual recovery as he prepares for the upcoming season.\nMeasured Approach to Recovery\nThe decision to ease Rodriguez back into full activity reflects a thoughtful strategy. Rather than rushing his return, the coaching staff is allowing him to regain his timing and build strength at a comfortable pace. The option to gain extra at-bats during minor league games provides him with the opportunity to lead off each inning, helping him gradually recapture his form without the pressure of immediate high-stakes performance.\nSeason Outlook and Recent Performance\nRodriguez, known for his star status as a two-time All-Star and Silver Slugger, is coming off a season marked by a .273 average along with 20 home runs and 24 stolen bases. Despite battling inconsistency, a slow start, and an ankle injury, his work ethic and talent remain evident. With Opening Day just a week away, his gradual return to practice signals readiness for a promising season and the continued evolution of a key figure for his team.",
