    "text": "Deepfake technology - the use of deep-learning artificial intelligence to create fake content online - creates a troubling portrait of consent in the digital age. A 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors sexual deepfakes, found that 95% of all online deepfake videos are nonconsensual porn and 90% of those featured women. The Milstein Program in the College of Arts and Sciences, partnering with Cornell Cinema, will present [a free screening of the documentary \"Another Body,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Wlf9BcEI) which focuses on the gendered implications of deepfake technology. The screening will be on Wednesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at Cornell Cinema. This event is part of the [Science on Screens](https://scienceonscreen.org/) initiative, and will feature an introduction by Gili Vidan, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, as well as a post-show Q&A with one of the film's directors. \"Another Body\" follows a college student's search for answers and justice after she discovers that the image of her face has been used without her consent in deepfake pornography. \"As deepfakes become increasingly commonplace, the film provides a look at the culture of the people behind them and asks why they do it. The answer is disturbing,\" says Milstein Program director [Austin Bunn](https://pma.cornell.edu/austin-bunn), associate professor of performing & media arts.

    "title": "Vermont GOP rules bar it from promoting any candidate who is a ‘convicted felon'",
    "text": "The Vermont Republican Party is prohibited from backing a candidate with a felony conviction, according to the party’s publicly posted rules .\nThat is now a bit of a problem, since the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was recently convicted on 34 felony counts .\n“The state committee will not support or promote any candidate for elective office who … is a convicted felon,” read the rules, which govern everything from party meetings to how delegates must vote at national conventions.\nOn social media, the party does technically appear to be following the rule — there are no mentions of Donald Trump on the Vermont GOP’s Twitter or Facebook pages in the days since the former president’s historic guilty verdict in his hush money case — but the party’s social media typically talks only about local candidates and presidential candidates who visit the state.\nThe rule has been on the books since at least 2013, according to an archived version of the rules, but by early 2022, the party appears to have amended their rules.\nDonald Trump Jun 5 Trump's gun license expected to be revoked after conviction in hush money trial Donald Trump Jun 5 Trump Georgia election case halted pending outcome of challenge to D.A. According to the Internet Archive, the posted rules were changed by March 2022 to allow the state committee to exempt a candidate from the rule by majority vote.\nIt’s unclear if such a rule will affect how Vermont’s GOP delegates vote at the Republican National Convention in July.\nFormer U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley won all of Vermont’s delegates but suspended her campaign in March; she has since endorsed Trump. The party rules dictate that delegates to the RNC are not bound if a candidate withdraws or suspends their campaign.\nThe Republican National Committee and Paul Dame, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn 2022, when Trump announced his bid for the presidency, Dame said in a statement that he did not believe Trump was the right choice for the party.\n“I believe that the best thing for the future of the party is for other qualified and accomplished Republicans to join the primary to give Republican voters a better choice in the 2024 election,” he said.\nIn a statement, the Democratic National Committee suggested Vermont Republicans instead support President Joe Biden in November.\n“We already knew Donald Trump was a threat to the American people and our democracy, but according to the Vermont GOP’s own rules, Donald Trump isn’t even eligible to receive their support,” Deputy Communications Director Abhi Rahman said. “We look forward to the Vermont Republican Party supporting Joe Biden this November — the only candidate with a path to 270 that has not been convicted of a felony.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "title": "Associação de Moradores arranca da prefeitura de Hortolândia (SP) 35 dias para evitar despejo de sede histórica",
    "text": "A prefeitura de [Hortolândia](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2019/04/17/reintegracao-em-hortolandia-sp-e-mantida-e-150-familias-podem-ficar-desalojadas/) (SP), sob a gestão de Zezé Gomes (Republicanos), amanheceu com sua entrada travada por um corredor humano de manifestantes, nesta quinta-feira (8). Com o ato, membros da associação de moradores dos bairros Parque Santo André, Jd. Santa Amélia e Jd. Everest conseguiram mais 35 dias para evitar a remoção forçada da sede onde estão há 40 anos. A reintegração de posse - inicialmente marcada para a próxima segunda-feira (12) e agora suspensa temporariamente - faz parte da intenção da administração de Gomes de instalar, no lugar, uma creche a ser gerida por uma Organização de Sociedade Civil (OSC). Instalada no espaço antes da criação do próprio município de Hortolândia, que tem 33 anos, a Sociedade dos Amigos destes três bairros (Samest) tinha a concessão pública do uso do imóvel até 2050. No último 12 de julho, a direção da associação foi surpreendida com a notificação de que a concessão tinha sido revogada e que em um mês seriam despejados caso não saíssem do imóvel por conta própria. \"Esta concessão foi revogada do dia para a noite pelo prefeito Zezé Gomes sem nenhum diálogo com os moradores, a associação, a Câmara dos Vereadores. Foi um 'decretasso'. Simplesmente achou que, na canetada, pode acabar com a Samest\", afirma Lucas Bueno, membro do coletivo de educação popular Flor de Maio, um dos que compõem a gestão da associação. Entre as atividades realizadas pela entidade comunitária estão um cursinho pré-vestibular, formação para educadores, aulas de libras, ballet e capoeira, encontro de narcóticos anônimos, biblioteca, horta comunitárias, cine-debates e um grupo de astronomia popular. \"Conseguimos a suspensão da revogação do termo de concessão do uso do espaço público que a gente tinha em mãos\", explica Carolina Catini, coordenadora do programa de extensão do coletivo Flor de Maio. \"Suspenderam por 35 dias, colocando a possibilidade de a gente encontrar um lugar para a creche que querem implementar, que não é demanda do bairro\", conta. A poucos quarteirões da sede, há uma creche municipal que leva, inclusive, o nome de um dos ex-diretores da Samest. \"Por que precisam que seja especificamente o prédio da associação, que não é adaptado para crianças, aquele destinado à creche?\", questiona um documento da entidade. \"Por que, em vez disso, não alugar outro espaço para alocar a creche? Qual a necessidade de tirar de sua sede uma das poucas associações de moradores que continuam promovendo tantas atividades para a comunidade?\", segue o manifesto. Ao Brasil de Fato, a gestão municipal de Hortolândia informou que estabeleceu o prazo de cinco dias úteis para a associação visitar um espaço localizado em outro bairro, o Jd. Santa Clara do Lago I. \"A prefeitura propôs a Samest mudar-se para esse local\", afirmou. Nova reunião entre a prefeitura e associação está agendada para daqui a 15 dias.
