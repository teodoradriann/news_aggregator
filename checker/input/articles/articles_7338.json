    "text": "Kate Middleton shares that life wasn't the same for her after cancer fight: ‘The phase afterwards is really difficult’\nKate Middleton shares her experiences with cancer recovery, revealing the emotional challenges faced after treatment.\nKate Middleton, months after announcing she was in remission, following abdominal surgery and a subsequent cancer diagnosis in early 2024, has revealed\nThe Daily Beast reported that in her first public remarks since abruptly pulling out of the Royal Ascot in June, which caused “a real sense of panic” within the palace, Kate's team explained at the time that she skipped Ascot in the interest of “balance.”\nDuring a hospital garden visit on Wednesday, the Princess of Wales didn’t directly address her absence, but expressed, “You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment’s done, then it’s like, ‘I can crack on, get back to normal,’ but actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult,” per People Magazine.\nALSO READ| Meghan Markle could face Diana-like end, Royal insider's grim warning here\n“You’re not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you’re not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to. And actually, someone to help talk you through that, show you and guide you through that sort of phase that comes after treatment, I think is really valuable.”\n“You have to find your new normal and that takes time... and it’s a rollercoaster, it’s not smooth, like you expect it to be. The reality is you go through hard times,” she added.\nKate Middleton reassesses life after cancer\nKate finished chemotherapy in September 2024 and confirmed remission in January 2025. Her office said her latest garden visit was meant to “celebrate the incredible healing power of nature and raise awareness of the important role that spending time in nature plays in bringing us joy and supporting our mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing.”\n“Kate is recalibrating her entire life, her entire work-life balance,” one insider told The Daily Beast. “Ascot was a wakeup call, not a one-off.”\n“The last few years have been horrific; the disgusting things that Harry said about her and William and her family, the relentless speculation about her and William, the queen’s death, the king’s diagnosis which had them both thinking they were going to have to take over and then her own cancer diagnosis and treatment,” the source claimed.\nALSO READ| Kate Middleton emotionally reflects on hardships after cancer treatment, admits she's ‘not able to…'\n“It’s all taken its toll, and if she needs more time to recover, William will fight tooth and nail to see she is given it.”\nUS newsand global updates from Pakistan, UK, Bangladesh, and Russia get all the latest headlines in one place with including\nVance Luther Boelteron Hindustan Times.\nUS newsand global updates from Pakistan, UK, Bangladesh, and Russia get all the latest headlines in one place with including\nVance Luther Boelteron Hindustan Times.\nNews/\nWorld News/ Kate Middleton shares that life wasn't the same for her after cancer fight: ‘The phase afterwards is really difficult’",

    "text": "Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Secretary Conrado M. Estrella III Edjen Oliquino Published on: Aug 15, 2024, 16:20\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) said Thursday it has granted thousands of land titles to qualified farmer-beneficiaries, dispelling claims the issuance of titles has been plummeting over the years.\nDAR Secretary Conrado Estrella III told the House Committee on Appropriations that he was “willing to sit down” with Gabriela Partylist Rep. Arlene Brosas to reconcile the purported disparities in the figures she cited.\n“Maybe you need to talk to the Department of Agrarian Reform because the data you are citing does not match the multitude of titles we are giving out,” Estrella said in Filipino during the House deliberation on the DAR’s budget for 2025.\nHe added, “The titles are increasing every year, but you are saying that the lands being distributed are dwindling.”\nBrosas cited a document stipulating that the number of certificates of land ownership awards (CLOA) issued to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) had significantly abated.\n“In 2020, there were 22,969 ARBS. In 2021, there were 50,170. Then in 2022, there were 26,138,” she said.\nThe CLOA is a government-issued title to an individual who must be a bona fide tenant or landless resident of the barangay where the land is located.\nAny Filipino citizen who can cultivate and make the land productive is entitled to receive a CLOA.\nEstrella warned that if the agency caught any recipients selling their land after less than 10 years, “we would take it back and give it to another owner.”\n“Many OFWs (overseas Filipino workers are) waiting to receive titles,” he added.\nDepartment of Agrarian Reform",

    "text": "Extreme heat takes toll on South and Southeast Asia\nUpdated: 2025-05-08 11:05\nIncreasing number of heatstroke deaths are reported in South and Southeast Asia, according to Asia News Network members.\nPakistan-based newspaper The Dawn, said on April 29 that Pakistan is in the midst of an intense heat wave, with temperatures soaring 4 C to 7 C above normal across much of the country, with some regions already experiencing highs of 49 C.\nThe memory of the 2015 Karachi heat wave, which claimed over 1,200 lives, looms large and must not be ignored. Meanwhile, power outages in various areas highlight the fragility of the energy grid at a time when uninterrupted supply is a matter of life and death, The Dawn said.\nThe Nation, a newspaper in Thailand, said on April 29 that there have already been 32 reported cases of heat-related illnesses this year, equivalent to 0.07 per 100,000 population.\nThailand's Public Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin disclosed forecasts for Thailand's heat from the end of April to early May. Some regions are expected to experience dangerous conditions of 52 C or higher.\nData from the past six years (2019-24) recorded a cumulative total of 212 fatalities in Thailand, averaging 27 deaths per year.\nMost of the victims were men (197 cases) aged between 41 and 60, often with underlying health conditions, outdoor activity exposure, or alcohol consumption as contributing factors, The Nation reported.\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer also said on April 30 that two traffic enforcers died this year from causes related to extreme heat conditions.\nUldarico Garbanzos, head of the Iloilo City Traffic and Transportation Management Office, said the extreme weather had exacerbated their underlying medical conditions.\nGarbanzos said they have requested personnel to notify them of any comorbidities or if they are consuming maintenance medicine. These personnel will be transferred to afternoon schedules to avoid prolonged heat exposure.\nThe heatstroke situation aligns with predictions from the World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which state that by 2050, over 50 percent of the global population could experience dangerously high temperatures for at least 20 days a year. The risk of heat-related deaths in tropical countries could triple, especially among vulnerable groups.\nPublic health infrastructure is also under immense pressure. Hospitals are seeing an increase in heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable groups such as outdoor laborers, the elderly and children, The Dawn said.\nAgriculture under stress\nThe effects of the heat wave are rippling through every sector. Agriculture is under severe stress as excess heat kills crops and worsens water scarcity. Reports of early wheat crop failures are already emerging in Pakistan, threatening both food security and rural livelihoods.\nAt the same time, water resources are being strained to the limit. Faster-than-normal snowmelt in Himalayan mountains, spurred by high temperatures, raises the specter of flash floods while jeopardizing water availability during the critical summer months.\nThe Dawn calls on relief measures without delay. Cooling centers should be established in urban and rural hot spots. Water resources must be managed and prioritized for essential needs and work hours for outdoor labor should be adjusted to minimize exposure.\nPublic health services need to be fully equipped to manage heatstroke and related conditions, and power must be prioritized for hospitals and essential water infrastructure.\nBeyond these short-term interventions, there is a pressing need for a long-term strategy to adapt to the warming climate.\nThis includes investing in water storage and management, promoting climate-resilient crops and efficient irrigation techniques, and expanding urban greenery to reduce heat absorption. Early warning systems must be enhanced, and local disaster response mechanisms strengthened to ensure timely action, The Dawn said.\nThis story is a compilation of recent reports on heatstroke deaths by ANN members, including The Dawn, Pakistan, The Nation, Thailand, and The Philippine Daily Inquirer.",
