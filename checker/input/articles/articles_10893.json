Tuipulotu, 25, was a sixth-round pick by the Eagles out of USC back in the 2021 NFL Draft. He made it onto the active roster as a rookie and appeared in five games. The following season he appeared in nine games before winding up on injured reserve in November 2022 due to a torn meniscus. Tuipulotu was among the Eagles final roster cuts this offseason and he signed with the Chiefs practice squad just two days after being released.

    "text": "On New Year’s Eve, Lightning Struck The U.S. Capitol, The Washington Monument, The Empire State Building And One World Trade Center\nOn New Year’s Eve lightning struck four of the most iconic buildings in the United States. If lightning had hit just one of those buildings, it could have easily been dismissed as a coincidence, but that isn’t what we witnessed. I don’t know why more people aren’t talking about this, because what just occurred in Washington D.C. and New York City is very strange indeed.\nPsychological terror: Islamic Jihad claims Israeli hostage tried to commit suicide\nA spokesman for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group in Gaza claimed that an unnamed Israeli hostage being held by the group attempted to take his own life. This marks the latest instance of psychological warfare against Israel, leveraging the 100 remaining hostages in Gaza.\nIDF soldiers say AI system known as ‘the Gospel’ has led to increase in civilian casualties in Gaza\nThe IDF has publicly acknowledged its use of an AI system it calls “Habsora” (“the Gospel”) for generating targets in Gaza, saying the AI system is a valuable asset in helping Israel achieve its goal of eradicating the Hamas terrorist organization. Responding to accusations that its AI systems have led to an increase in civilian casualties, the IDF told the Post that such criticisms are “off the mark.”\nIsrael kills Hamas police chief; DM Katz threatens more strikes if Hamas won’t release hostages\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later confirmed the killing of Shahwan, who served as head of Hamas’ internal security in the southern part of the strip. “The internal security mechanism of the terrorist organization Hamas has carried out violent investigations against the residents of the Gaza Strip, while seriously infringing on human rights and oppressing the organization’s opponents,”\nUS troops begin base construction in Kurdish city in response to Turkish aggression\nSyrian media states that the United States is constructing a military base in Kobani (Ain al-Arab), a Kurdish city in northern Aleppo situated near the Turkey-Syria border. (watch)\nBiden presented with options for attack on Iran nuclear program\nAccording to the report, the plans were presented about a month ago by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and were developed for the event that Iran makes a push to develop a nuclear bomb before the inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump on January 20.\n‘Turkey is becoming the new Iran in Syria’\nTurkey is becoming the new Iran in Syria. Iran supported Bashar al-Assad, Turkey supports Abu Mohammad al-Julani, and as we all know, Turkey is not our best ally as it used to be before. The only difference is that Iran was not part of NATO and Turkey is part of NATO,” he said.\nReports in Syria: Israel struck defense facilities east of Aleppo\nThe Saudi television channel Al-Hadath reported that “the attacks in Syria, which appear to be Israeli, targeted defense factories in the area of the city of As-Safira, east of Aleppo,” adding that the city has “some of the largest defense factories in Syria.” Russian news agency Sputnik claimed that three Israeli fighter jets flew over the city of Aleppo and fired several missiles, which were aimed at military factories and scientific research centers.\nAntisemitic Hate Crimes in Massachusetts Reach Eight-Year High\nThe US state of Massachusetts saw more antisemitic hate crimes in 2023 than at any time since government officials began tracking such data eight years ago, according to a report issued by its Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS).\n‘Reality’s Last Stand’: In A Case On The Protection Of Children, Will The Supreme Court Uphold The Truth?\nTo be completely upfront, the reason for this article is a call to get on our knees and pray for a clear and decisive victory to protect children and youth in Tennessee and across the country from reckless, unsubstantiated, harmful and often irreversible medical experiments. This case has massive implications for at least two reasons. First, if you have ever listened to the testimony of a sterile, regretful, broken 20-year-old detransitioning woman, and tears don’t pour from your eyes, you don’t have a heart. Young lives are permanently damaged, and no one warned them.\n“Trump Is Not Wrong” – MSNBC Finally Admits Massive Spike In Illegal Immigration Under Biden\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-not-wrong-msnbc-finally-admits-massive-spike-illegal-immigration-under-biden\nUnless you have lived under a rock or never dared to venture beyond MSNBC or CNN or the front page of the New York Times as your source of ‘news’, none of this will come as a surprise at all… But, for those that have lived blinkered from the truth about the border for the past four years, MSNBC just sent your minds to ’11’ on the ‘cognitive dissonance’ scale as they dared to show a chart that – hold your breath here for a moment – shows a massive surge in illegal immigration during Biden’s reign\nCorporations Clinging To DEI Will Lose Social License To Operate\nAmericans hate racial discrimination, and they hate inequality borne of government force. However, if you try to solve the problem of inequality by engaging in Orwellian and neo-racist “discrimination in the name of anti-discrimination” (often advanced under the banners of “antiracism” and “DEI” — “diversity, equity, and inclusion”), then you will sooner or later experience the wrath of the people.\nNew Florida Bill Would Prohibit Illegal Immigrants From Filing Lawsuits\nA new bill introduced to Florida’s state legislature intends to prohibit illegal immigrants from being able to utilize the civil court system to file lawsuits and other legal actions. Titled HB 71: Civil Actions Brought by Unauthorized Aliens, the single-page bill stated, “an unauthorized alien may not commence a civil action,” using the definition of “unauthorized aliens” as stated in the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. …someone who enters the country illegally has no legal standing to file lawsuits, be it for a slip and fall or malpractice.\n10 Questions We Should All Be Asking About The New Year’s Day Terror Attacks\nThere were dozens of major terror attacks in 2024, but most of the population is not going to pay attention unless something happens within our own borders. Sadly, everyone is paying attention now.\nSo was this the end, or is this just the beginning?\nMajor winter storm to impact U.S. through the first weekend of 2025\nMillions across the central and eastern U.S. are bracing for a major winter storm expected to dump heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain, with dangerous travel conditions and power outages anticipated through the first weekend of 2025\nDEVELOPING: One Dead, 15 Injured After Plane Crashes Into Warehouse Near SoCal Airport\nOne person is dead and 15 are injured are a small plane crashed into a warehouse near an airport in Fullerton, California.\nRussian launches 111 drones at Ukraine in deadly New Year’s attack, Kyiv says\nOne person was killed and least six others, including a pregnant woman, were injured in Kyiv as Russia launched more than 100 drones in an overnight strike into New Year’s Day, Ukrainian military and civilian officials said.\nUS Fighter Jet Shot Down Over Red Sea In Disastrous ‘Friendly Fire’ Incident\nIn the early morning hours of Sunday (local), two US Navy pilots were shot down over the Red Sea in an apparent friendly fire incident. This comes after more than a year of war against Yemeni Houthi rebels, who have targeted international transit in regional waters.\nHundreds chant for ‘intifada’ at New Year’s Day protest in NYC’S Times Square/\nSeveral hundred demonstrators called for an intifada on Wednesday at an anti-Israel protest in New York City’s Times Square to mark New Year’s Day.\nAttention Parents: Foreign-Made AI Toys For Kids Used As Possible Propaganda Weapons\nVideos circulating on X show a foreign-made AI robot, available on Amazon and designed for children, allegedly spreading misinformation and disinformation favoring the Democratic Party. The most alarming part is the potential for foreign propaganda operations targeting American youth through seemingly cute and lovely AI robots. This raises serious national security concerns that may warrant an investigation on Capitol Hill during Trump 2.0.\nBourbon Street Jihad Terror: Shamsud-Din Jabbar’s Attack Was Islam in Action, Not a Distortion of It\nShamsud-Din Jabbar’s actions were not a distortion of Islam but a direct manifestation of jihadist ideology, driven by his allegiance to ISIS and adherence to violent doctrines within Islamic texts.\nNew Orleans Jihad Attack: How Government Cowardice and Islamic Whitewashing Endanger America\nThe attack in New Orleans was not just an act of terror; it was a glaring reminder of a government more committed to appeasing Islam and preserving political correctness than protecting American lives.\nSwitzerland’s Burqa Ban: A Stand for Freedom or a Sign of Deeper Problems\nSwitzerland’s burqa ban boldly defends Western values, yet its necessity reveals the gravity of the threat—after all, if clothes do not make the man, the uniform does not make the soldier.\nHere are a few of the new laws taking effect in the US in 2025\nAll US adults will be required to present REAL ID-compliant identification to fly domestically and access certain federal facilities from May 2025. This is just one of the new laws taking effect in the US in 2025. As well as new identification requirements for domestic travel, state laws governing everything from the use of artificial intelligence to transgender health care will soon be enforced.\n10 stories of people who were punished for wrongthink in 2024\nWe look back on the craziest stories in 2024 of people being punished for their wrong think.\nUK is on the brink of economic collapse, market analyst warns\nThe UK is on the brink of economic collapse, with catastrophic fiscal conditions, a large budget deficit and high interest rates, Alex Krainer has warned.\nThe curiously evolving relationship between Russia and the terrorist group that took control of Syria\nThe following is a compilation of reports made by the Russian news agency TASS relating to Russia’s view of the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (“HTS”) which assumed governance of Syria last month.",

    "text": "Considerado como un “trato no justo” para Harvey Weinstein , fue que el Tribunal de Apelaciones anuló la sentencia del exmagnate, al considerar que el juez del histórico movimiento #MeToo prejuzgó a Weinstein con fallos “atroces” inapropiados.\nLas calles del terror | Episodio 03 | Lo Que La Gente Cuenta: El Podcast\n[VIDEO] La mejor manera de conocer la historia de una ciudad es recorrer sus calles. Pero hay algunas que esconden un oscuro y misterioso pasado. Estas son las experiencias de 3 personas que sintieron terror absoluto mientras transitaban por las calles de su ciudad. Esto es “Las calles del terror”. Escúchanos también en Spotify: https://bit.ly/LQLGCpodcast Se argumentó esta decisión con base en que se llamó a la corte indebidamente a mujeres como testigos , quienes aseguraron haber sido víctimas del productor , donde se dice que las acusaciones que ellas dieron, no formaban parte del caso.\n“ El remedio a estos errores enormes es un nuevo juicio ”, fueron las palabras con las que argumentaron esta decisión, sumando 3 jueces los que votaron en contra en documentos anexos, contra 4 que votaron a favor de la anulación de esta sentencia . Uno de los jueces que no estaba de acuerdo con esto, declaró: “ Este tribunal continúa frustrando los constantes avances por los que han luchado los sobrevivientes de violencia sexual en nuestro sistema de justicia penal” . Algo claramente conciso y verdadero.\nHarvey se encontraba cumpliendo dos penas de prisión en un penal de Mohawk (estado de Nueva York) ; una de 23 años y otra de 16 , en ambas por delitos relacionados con abusos sexuales . Así que la anulación de hoy no significa su liberación , sino su posible traslado a California para cumplir la segunda sentencia.\nEl diario New York Time s declaró haber contactado a los abogados de Weinstein , quienes no supieron especificar si él ya se entero del nuevo fallo. Además la Fiscalía de Manhattan expresó su disgusto y en declaró, por medio de su portavoz Emily Tuttle : “Haremos lo que esté en nuestro poder para volver a juzgar el caso, y nos mantenemos firmes en nuestro compromiso con los supervivientes de las agresiones sexuales” .\nLas acusaciones contra Harvey Weinstein comenzaron en el año 2017, desencadenando más tarde el movimiento famoso #MeToo , el cual expuso abusos sexuales en los más altos niveles de la industria cinematográfica de Hollywood y otros ámbitos del medio del espectáculo.\nTambién te puede interesar: Estos son los actores que apoyaron a Brian Peck, supuesto violador de Nickelodeon\nCerca de Hollywood 7 en Google News!",
