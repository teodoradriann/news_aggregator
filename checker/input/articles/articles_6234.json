    "title": "Real estate billionaire Barry Sternlicht says rents will rise in two years—and it’s Jerome Powell’s fault",
    "text": "Barry Sternlicht, chief executive officer of Starwood Capital Group. Starwood Capital Group’s chief executive and chairman doesn’t seem to be a fan of the Federal Reserve. The billionaire behind the real estate investment firm, Barry Sternlicht, has mocked and blamed the institution and its chair, Jerome Powell, on several occasions. Sternlicht once called the Fed, “Jay Powell and his merry band of lunatics,” in an interview with Fortune, claiming there’d be “social unrest” because of its monetary tightening. On another occasion, he called the Fed’s interest rate hikes “self-inflicted suicide.” And of course, some of his angst could have to do with the impact rate increases may have had on his own business, which has invested in and managed billions in real estate assets during the past three decades In an interview with CNBC yesterday, Sternlicht didn’t change his tune, although he was less colorful. “This is my problem with Powell,” he said. “His policy has now crushed multifamily starts; we need houses.” Sternlicht continued: “So with only 220,000 houses coming in [2026], I will guarantee you rents will go up in ’26, unless there’s a massive recession.” Essentially, he’s suggesting that fewer apartments will be built in the coming years because of increased cost and risk, which then means rents will go up because it’ll only worsen an already existing housing shortage. The country is missing millions of homes, and it’s partly why home prices haven’t fallen, despite skyrocketing mortgage rates and depressed sales activity. When it comes to rents, which along with home prices rose throughout the pandemic-fueled housing boom, they’ve sort of flatlined. But, in some places, they’ve dropped because of a recent boom in multifamily construction: According to Redfin, “the Sunbelt is seeing some of the biggest rent declines in America.” “The Sun Belt has built a ton of new apartments in recent years, partly to meet the surge in demand brought on by the flood of people who moved in during the pandemic housing boom. But the boom is over, and now property owners are struggling to fill vacancies, which is causing rents to fall,” Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari said last month. “The good news is that the uptick in housing supply in the Sun Belt has improved affordability for renters, which can be a lesson for other American cities grappling with housing affordability challenges.” Still, some suggest this is a temporary phenomenon, similar to what Sternlicht is arguing. And again, this weakness in multifamily homes isn’t great for investors, who are often blamed online for the housing crisis. But it is good for typical Americans. When the Fed began raising interest rates to tame inflation, it sent a shock to commercial real estate, and multifamily. Values that rode the money waves of the pandemic plummeted, and loans are maturing in an environment where rents have cooled off and interest rates are much higher. There could be more pain ahead for all commercial real estate, and it still feels as though the entire sector is at a standstill. “Transaction volumes across the world are still down 70%,” Sternlicht said. “There are no trades. So the only one who’s trading is a mortgage coming due, and if they can’t find somebody to rescue them, they’ll sell it.” And banks don’t want a non-performing mortgage, so they sell, too, he said, referring to short sales. Every time there’s a crisis, said Sternlicht, there’s a disconnect in what buyers are asking for and what sellers want. Sellers want to bargain and buyers want yesterday’s prices, Sternlicht explained. But that gap has shrunk. “The spreads are coming in, which means the markets are healing—the future is getting clearer, particularly for apartments,” he said.

    "title": "Vietnam veteran’s Medal of Honor to be permanently displayed at Veterans Memorial Museum in Chehalis | The Daily Chronicle",
    "text": "Franklin D. Miller, or “Dean,” as he was known to his unit during the Vietnam War, was a U.S. Army command sergeant major who was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 5, 1971, by former President Richard Nixon. He was given the Medal of Honor for his actions during a battle on Jan. 5, 1970, while deployed in Vietnam, Veterans Memorial Museum Executive Director Chip Duncan said. Now, 54 years to the day after the battle, Miller’s Medal of Honor will be delivered by his daughter, Danielle Keller, of Portland, during a ceremony to the Veterans Memorial Museum in Chehalis, where it will be permanently displayed. The ceremony will begin at 1 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2024, at the museum, located at 100 SW Veterans Way in Chehalis. Along with Keller, the ceremony will also feature Skip Ettinger, a lifelong friend of Miller’s; retired U.S. Army Colonel Rick Thomas, former commander of the 1st Special Forces Group at Fort Lewis; and U.S. Army Master Sergeant Earl Plumlee, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions while deployed in Afghanistan in 2013. “Skip is here in Washington state, and he learned that Danielle was, instead of leaving it in a closet or a box, looking for a place to display the Medal of Honor,“ Duncan told The Chronicle on Dec. 28. Duncan has been working with Keller and Ettinger for three years in an effort to get a display set up for Miller’s Medal of Honor. Miller, a staff sergeant and a member of the U.S. Army’s 5th Special Forces Group at the time, specialized in reconnaissance patrols. On Jan. 5, 1970, he was a team leader for a joint American-Vietnamese unit on a long-range reconnaissance patrol deep within enemy territory. After leaving a helicopter intersection point on the patrol, one of Miller’s unit members tripped an explosive enemy booby trap, wounding four members of his patrol. Miller quickly administered first aid and moved his unit into a defensible position, as he knew the explosion alerted nearby Vietcong fighters. Once his unit was secure in a defensible position, Miller went out alone to face what he estimated to be a platoon-sized enemy force — between 20 and 50 soldiers — approaching his unit’s position. He single-handedly repulsed two initial enemy attacks before rejoining his unit and calling for a helicopter extraction for his men. However, the only suitable extraction point was a bomb crater some 150 meters from his unit’s position. Miller scouted a route to the crater and led his men through the jungle to it, but as the helicopter hovered over the crater to extract them, the Vietcong launched another attack against Miller’s unit, causing the helicopter to leave. The enemy’s attack continued, leaving Miller heavily wounded. Only two other men in his patrol survived. Despite the Vietcong’s persistence, Miller continued to repel enemy advances until a friendly relief force reached their position to provide assistance. “Miller's gallantry, intrepidity in action, and selfless devotion to the welfare of his comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army,” reads Miller’s Medal of Honor citation. Miller died June 30, 2000, in Florida. Those looking to learn more about Miller can read his book, “Reflections of a Warrior: Six Years as a Green Beret in Vietnam,” available from Amazon and other online retailers.

    "text": "\\nNo fewer than 44% of reef-building coral species are at risk of global extinction, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which has announced the results of its global assessment at the COP29 UN climate conference in Azerbaijan.\n\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature & Natural Resources has assessed the conservation status of 892 warmwater reef-building coral species for its Red List , which is currently marking its 60th anniversary. The last such assessment was carried out 16 years ago, when around 33% of corals were considered under threat.\n\\n\\u201cAs world leaders gather at the UN climate conference in Baku, this global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\\u201d said IUCN director-general Dr Grethel Aguilar.\\xa0\n\\n\\u201cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \\u2013 providing food, stabilising coastlines and storing carbon. The protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our well-being but crucial for our survival.\\xa0\n\\n\\u201cClimate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\\u201d\n\\n Reef in Raja Ampat (IUCN Picture Library / Jason Suwandy) \\nThe findings were based on the most recent status update from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network ( GCRMN ) alongside current and future threats such as the projected increase in warming and major bleaching events, using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data.\n\\nIn addition to climate change and related severe bleaching events, other threats to coral health include pollution, agricultural run-off, disease and unsustainable fishing.\n\\n Staghorn and elkhorn \\nThe IUCN offered as examples staghorn ( Acropora cervicornis ) and elkhorn coral ( A palmata ), Critically Endangered species in the Caribbean that had experienced significant declines because of increased warming, water pollution, hurricanes and the severe impacts of coral diseases.\n\\n Elkhorn coral \\u2013 Critically Endangered in the Caribbean (MSC) \\nThe main solutions for saving corals from extinction are cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and actions to strengthen species\\u2019 resilience. The assessors also recommend more research into whether and how corals can adapt to warmer waters, with evidence of adaptation limited so far.\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve known for decades that coral reefs are on the frontline of the global climate and biodiversity crises, and this new result only reconfirms this,\\u201d said Dr David Obura, co-chair of the IUCN SSC Coral Specialist Group.\n\\n\\u201cWithout relevant decisions from those with the power to change this trajectory, we will see the further loss of reefs and progressive disappearance of coral species at larger and larger scales.\\u201d\\xa0\n\\n Coldwater corals \\nThe majority of corals are found across the Indo-Pacific but the global assessment of reef-building corals also includes 85 Atlantic species highlighted recently in a PLOS One journal article, these being particularly highly threatened by severe annual bleaching events, pollution and disease.\n\\n \\n \\n \\nRed List assessments of coldwater corals are ongoing, with only 22 species of a total of 4,000+ having been assessed so far. The main threats to these species include bottom trawling, deep-sea mining, oil and gas drilling\\xa0 and deep-sea cable-laying, with white coral ( Desmophyllum pertusum ) one example of a species assessed as Vulnerable.\\xa0\n\\n\\u201cThe latest global assessment brings troubling news for corals, with more than 340 species now being considered at risk of extinction,\\u201d said MSC Foundation chief science advisor Prof David Smith.\n\\n\\u201cAn ocean without functioning coral reefs would be a bleak reality, highlighting the urgent need to find solutions to the climate crisis while simultaneously addressing today\\u2019s coral crisis.\\u201d\n\\n\\n\n\\n",

    "text": "近日，徐州司仪、主持人马建喜创作的“苏超”励志歌曲《继续战斗》引发关注。这首凝聚着徐州球迷热情与奋斗精神的作品，源于比赛现场的见闻，以滚烫的歌词和激昂的旋律，传递出永不言弃的战斗信念。\n　　马建喜深耕本土文化传播多年，他热心公益，曾多次组织、参与各类公益演出活动，在一次公益演出期间，因为布置舞台身体意外受伤。“我体会到了健全人和残疾人的不同，以及在工作和生活上的诸多不便，当然，还有许多心理上挥之不去的情结。”马建喜并没有因为身体的不便，放弃自己的文艺梦想。他又回到了舞台，回到了剪辑室，回到了录音棚，带着自信的笑容，带着对生活的希望。\n　　7月5日，徐州队1球之差惜败南通队，但徐州球迷没有责备，没有抱怨，只有对徐州球员热情的鼓励，当现场一位大哥与球迷们齐声喊出“继续战斗”口号时，马建喜被深深震撼了。“那一刻，眼泪夺眶而出，热血沸腾，立刻萌生了为家乡徐州创作一首励志歌曲的想法。”他回忆道。\n　　灵感涌流之下，马建喜红着眼，仅用两小时便完成了《继续战斗》的作词，随后构思了4版旋律，借助音乐软件辅助定调后，连夜联系贵州的好友共同完成编曲。在录制过程中，为精准传达歌曲的热血内核，马建喜一遍遍将嗓子吼至嘶哑临界点，再用一台电脑、一个话筒匆匆录音。“设备和技术条件有限，作品不算完美，这是我的遗憾。”马建喜坦言，目前最大的愿望是能与专业团队合作，为家乡重制这首歌曲。\n《继续战斗》曲谱\n　　在音乐创作领域，马建喜虽然并非科班出身，却有着不懈的追求——自2006年首次接触音乐创作以来，他陆续创作了23首随感作品，《继续战斗》正是其音乐热情与家乡情怀的集中体现。\n　　歌曲中，“继续战斗，绝不低头”“大风歌回荡战场尽头”等歌词，既呼应着苏超赛场上的拼搏精神，也传递出团结奋进、无惧风浪的信念，旋律与歌词交织，尽显热血与力量。（文/图 李鹏）",

    "text": "El Movimiento Cívico Nacional (MCN) expresó su rechazo ante la suspensión de actividades educativas en Guatemala, como consecuencia de medidas impulsadas por el Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Educación de Guatemala (STEG). La organización señaló que estas acciones afectan de manera directa a miles de estudiantes y comprometen la calidad del sistema educativo nacional.\nEn un comunicado difundido este miércoles 25 de junio, el MCN sostuvo que la educación ha sido “tomada como rehén” para asegurar privilegios sindicales, dejando de lado el derecho al aprendizaje de los niños y jóvenes guatemaltecos.\nCUESTIONAN FALTA DE TRANSPARENCIA El MCN también reiteró sus críticas al pacto colectivo negociado entre el STEG y el Ministerio de Educación (Mineduc), al cual calificó como un acuerdo “opaco” que favorece intereses particulares por encima del bien común. Según el movimiento, este pacto incluye privilegios que impactan negativamente la calidad educativa y ha sido negociado bajo condiciones de confidencialidad, impidiendo la supervisión ciudadana.\nA través de su iniciativa #DestapandoElPacto, el MCN aseguró haber documentado diversos abusos sindicales, los cuales, afirman, afectan a estudiantes, docentes y a la administración pública en general.\nEn medio de presión, sindicato de Joviel arremete contra trabajo de La Hora\nPIDEN QUE PACTOS SEAN PÚBLICOS Y SUJETOS A CONTROL Ante esta situación, el Movimiento Cívico Nacional exigió que todos los pactos colectivos y negociaciones que involucren recursos del Estado sean públicos, accesibles y sujetos a evaluaciones de calidad del gasto, como mecanismo para fortalecer la institucionalidad democrática y garantizar el derecho a la información.\n“Solo así podremos construir una verdadera República, en la que las instituciones respondan a los derechos ciudadanos”, señala el comunicado. Finalmente, el MCN hizo un llamado a priorizar la educación como un derecho fundamental, y no como una herramienta de presión sindical.\n📢ANTE LA OPINIÓN PÚBLICA MANIFESTAMOS: pic.twitter.com/UzWvr1cqZT\n— Movimiento Cívico Nacional (@MCNGuatemala) June 25, 2025",

    "title": "\"A Christmas Miracle,\" Universal Studios Icon Returns to Orlando - Inside the Magic",
    "text": "The Universal Studios resort in Florida has received a major upgrade just in time for Christmas. Related: [Multiple Disney Parks Hit Capacity, Guests Turned Away on Christmas](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/12/multiple-disney-parks-hit-capacity-guests-turned-away-on-christmas-ld1/) The Universal Orlando Resort is famous for a lot of things, but the most famous image fans have of this destination and company, in general, may just be the iconic globe at the front of the parks. Universal’s spinning globe is one of the most iconic logos and branding images in the entire world, making it a no-brainer to include it at the actual Universal Studios theme parks. The Universal Globe stands tall amongst other Florida landmarks like Cinderella Castle at [Magic Kingdom](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/06/a-comprehensive-guide-to-disneys-magic-kingdom-park-lh1/). Unfortunately, the globe outside of the Universal Orlando Resort was shut off for necessary maintenance. Thankfully, this globe has been restored and is spinning once again. You can take a look at the globe in action thanks to a clip from avid theme park photographer bioreconstruct: A Christmas miracle! The Universal globe is spinning again! Was in refurbishment for several weeks. [pic.twitter.com/XFjs4Ff9uU](https://t.co/XFjs4Ff9uU) — bioreconstruct (@bioreconstruct) [December 25, 2023](https://twitter.com/bioreconstruct/status/1739400615992734066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) bioreconstruct referred to this as a “Christmas miracle,” and we honestly have to agree with them. This massive globe is the first thing guests see and think of when they hear Universal Studios, so first impressions here are incredibly important. As they stated in the original tweet, the globe was in refurbishment for several weeks, and we honestly were not sure when or if it would return to its former glory. But we’re glad that it’s finally back at the resort, and on Christmas day, no less! Related: [Multiple Netflix Series Bury ‘Stranger Things’, New List Confirms Replacements](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/12/multiple-series-netflix-series-bury-stranger-things-new-list-confirms-replacements-ad1/) The Universal Orlando Resort is home to some truly remarkable and unique experiences, ranging from frightening thrill rides like VelociCoaster to iconic and historic attractions such as Jurassic Park River Adventure. The resort features two exciting theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Universal’s Islands of Adventure, both of which allow guests to immerse themselves in some of the best theme park experiences in the country, let alone the state of Florida. This resort is Walt Disney World’s biggest competition, bringing in millions of guests every year. It ranks in the same popularity as Disney’s Animal Kingdom, [EPCOT](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/05/an-epcot-park-guide-for-first-time-visitors-ktc1/), and Disney’s Hollywood Studios, only being beaten by the Magic Kingdom. But this may all soon change when Epic Universe officially opens. This massive expansion will act as the third theme park at the resort and will feature some truly incredible new rides, attractions, locations, and experiences for guests to enjoy. Among these new locations will be SUPER NINTENDO WORLD, as well as an entire land dedicated to the How To Train Your Dragon franchise. Epic Universe is set to open sometime in 2025, and we can’t wait to finally experience it.
