Simple to prepare, this comforting dish is perfect for weeknight dinners and offers a balance of savory and sweet flavors unique to Japanese curry. Serve over rice for a satisfying meal everyone will enjoy!\nTable of Contents What is Japanese Curry? Origins of Japanese Curry Differences Between Japanese Curry and Other Curries from Around the World Smooth vs. Chunky Japanese Curry Key Ingredients for Japanese Curry Japanese Curry Roux Protein Vegetables Kakushi Aji (Hidden Flavours and Secret Ingredients) How to Make Japanese Chicken Curry Top Tips for Delicious Japanese Curry How to Serve Japanese Curry How to Store and Reheat Leftover Curry Recipe FAQ More Japanese Curry Recipes to Try Japanese Chicken Curry Recipe What is Japanese Curry? Japanese curry is a popular comfort food known for its thick, mildly spiced, and slightly sweet flavor profile. Unlike other curries, Japanese curry uses a rich roux base that creates a stew-like consistency, often filled with tender pieces of meat, potatoes, carrots, and onions. This flavorful dish is typically served over steamed rice or with noodles like udon. Japanese curry is easy to customize with various spice levels and ingredients, making it a versatile dish loved by all ages. Its unique taste and simplicity have made it a staple in Japanese cuisine and a favorite around the world.\nOrigins of Japanese Curry Japanese curry, or Kare Raisu (カレーライス, Curry Rice) , arrived in Japan during the late 19th century via the British navy, who brought Indian-inspired curry during the Meiji era. Initially a foreign luxury, it quickly adapted to Japanese tastes, becoming milder, sweeter, and thicker than traditional Indian curries. The introduction of ready-made curry roux in the 20th century made it even more accessible, allowing households to prepare it quickly and easily. Over time, Japanese curry evolved into a beloved comfort food with regional varieties and endless ingredient combinations, commonly served over rice or with noodles like udon.\nDifferences Between Japanese Curry and Other Curries from Around the World Japanese curry differs from other curries around the world due to its milder, sweeter flavor profile and thicker consistency. Unlike many South Asian or Southeast Asian curries that rely heavily on a variety of spices and herbs, Japanese curry typically uses a pre-made roux (a mixture of fat, flour, and curry powder), making it easier to prepare and offering a rich, velvety texture. Additionally, Japanese curry is often served with steamed short-grain rice, which is softer and more neutral in flavor compared to the rice in other curry dishes.\nSmooth vs. Chunky Japanese Curry Chunky Japanese curry, with its hearty chunks of vegetables and meat, is more of a homestyle dish. On the other hand, smooth curry is commonly found in restaurants, where the curry is often blended to a velvety consistency. This smoother texture pairs perfectly with katsu, as it coats the crispy breaded cutlet without overpowering it.\nKey Ingredients for Japanese Curry There are many variations of Japanese curry, which can vary depending on the ingredients used, as well as the region, household, and restaurant. Here are the 4 basic components to Japanese curry:\nJapanese Curry Roux There are so many brands of curry roux on the market and vary greatly in flavour. Many also come in mild, medium or spicy. Try a few and see which brand you like the most as everyone has different preferences but here’s a general idea of some popular ones and what they taste like:\nS&B Golden Curry: Made with 35 kinds of spices and herbs, giving it a stronger curry flavor with a balance of acidity and sweetness. It has a medium spice level and a looser texture. House Kokumaru: Features caramelized onions and a creamy roux. The sweetness from the onions and added cheese and creams create a mellow, rich flavor. It has a slightly sweet, creamy taste with a smooth texture. House Vermont Curry: Contains apples and honey, making it the sweetest of the brands. It has a thick, almost milky texture, with a fruity flavor that’s popular among children. S&B Dinner Curry: Known for its umami and elegant richness. It’s light, with a medium spice level and a medium-thick texture. House Java Curry: The spiciest brand, with a deep, rich flavor profile. It has no noticeable acidity or sweetness and a medium-thick texture, making it a favorite among adults. Glico Zeppin: Uses 40 spices, resulting in a deeply rich flavor with a balanced mix of sweetness, acidity, and spice. It’s creamy with a thick consistency. S&B Torokeru: Well-balanced in spices with a slight sweetness. It has a looser texture than some other brands but still coats the back of a spoon. Torokeru line does not contain meat or dairy so a great option for vegans! I personally grew up eating Torokeru and Golden curry so it’s very comforting to me. However, I recently tried Zeppin curry and that might be my favourite! I also often combine two curries like Vermont (sweet curry) and Java (spicy) to get the best of both worlds.\nProtein Beef, pork, and chicken are all popular choices for curry. Beef brings a rich, umami flavor that enhances the overall taste of the dish. Pork is tender and juicy, complementing curry well, while chicken offers a lighter, fresher taste that balances the dish’s richness. Each meat works well in curry, so choose based on your mood and preferences. For today’s recipe, we’ll be using chicken.\nWhen using chicken, thighs and wings with the skin are the best options. These cuts offer more flavor, and the fat from the skin adds richness and aroma to the curry. However, skin on boneless chicken thighs are not as readily available here in North America so my mom always used skinless chicken thighs which is also preferred over chicken breast due to its flavour and tenderness.\nVegetables Onions, potatoes, and carrots are standard ingredients in curry. Onions provide sweetness and richness, forming the base of the dish. Potatoes add a ‘fluffy’ texture and natural sweetness, making them a popular choice. Carrots bring vibrant color and nutrition. You can also enhance your curry with other vegetables like mushrooms, eggplant, bell peppers, and broccoli for added flavor and variety.\nKakushi Aji (Hidden Flavours and Secret Ingredients) In Japanese chicken curry, adding a “ kakushi aji ” (隠し味), or “hidden flavor,” is a popular technique that elevates the dish with subtle layers of taste. These hidden ingredients, like soy sauce, coffee, honey, or chocolate, are added in small amounts to create a richer and more complex curry. For Japanese chicken curry, a spoonful of miso or splash of soy sauce enhances umami, while grated apple adds natural sweetness, balancing the curry’s savory and spicy notes. By incorporating kakushi aji, you can transform your Japanese chicken curry into a deeper, more nuanced meal that’s irresistibly flavorful and unique. I have a whole blogpost that covered kaksushi aji used in Japanese cooking for some ideas but here are some great options specifically for curry:\napples honey ketchup banana tomato yogurt garlic ginger red chili pepper black pepper chocolate cocoa powder instant coffee oyster sauce mirin sake rice vinegar red or white wine tonkatsu sauce (Worcester sauce) miso soy sauce (add after roux) dashi (stock instead of broth or water) How to Make Japanese Chicken Curry Japanese curry is one of the easiest meals to make! Here’s a quick rundown:\nPrepare Onions : Thinly slice one onion and cut the other into eighths. Microwave sliced onion for 2 minutes, stirring halfway. Set aside. Caramelize Onions : In a pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add microwaved onions, cooking until golden, about 10-15 minutes. Cook Chicken : Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a separate pan, cook chicken in oil over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes until no longer pink. Set aside. Build Curry Base : Add garlic and ginger to caramelized onions, sauté 2-3 minutes. Stir in cut onions, carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms. Add Chicken & Broth : Return chicken to pot. Pour in dashi or stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender. Flavor Curry : Grate an apple into the pot. Season with pepper and any additional flavors. Adjust to taste. Add Curry Roux : Once vegetables are soft, add broken-up curry roux. Stir until dissolved, then simmer 5-10 minutes to thicken. Serve : Serve hot over rice. Garnish with fukushinzuke and ryakyo. Enjoy! Top Tips for Delicious Japanese Curry Cut vegetables the same size: Varying ingredient sizes can cause uneven cooking—some pieces may remain firm and need extra time, while others might fall apart. To ensure even cooking, cut all ingredients to a uniform size. Quick, caramelized onions: Onions are a must in Japanese curry, but the extra step of caramelizing onions really add a lot of natural sweetness and flavour to curry. For quick caramelized onions, microwave them covered to speed up the wilting process and then finish it off in the pot until jammy. Skim the scum : This helps remove any unwanted odor and for a clean, pure and natural flavour from the chickena nd vegetables. Turn off the heat before adding roux: If the roux is heated too quickly, the starch may clump instead of dissolving smoothly into the broth. To prevent this, first turn off the heat, break up the roux, and add it to the pot, stirring until fully dissolved. Then, simmer on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the starch to cook fully, resulting in a thick, smooth curry. Simmer, don’t boil: Once the roux is added in, it is prone to burning. Always use low heat to simmer and stir every 5-10 minutes. Make extra: Curry tastes even better the next day! Make extra to have leftovers for the next day or freeze for future use. Japanese curry is great for meal prep! How to Serve Japanese Curry Japanese curry is traditionally served over a bed of Japanese short-grain rice, which complements its thick, mildly sweet, and savory sauce. For a classic presentation, pour the curry over half of the rice on a plate, leaving the other half visible. Garnish with pickled radish ( fukujinzuke ) or pickled onions ( ryakyo ). It’s also delicious with tonkatsu or chicken katsu creating a popular dish known as katsu curry .\nHow to Store and Reheat Leftover Curry To store leftover Japanese curry, allow it to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. When reheating, gently warm it on the stovetop over low heat, stirring occasionally, to prevent the sauce from sticking or separating. If the curry thickens after refrigeration, add a splash of water or broth to reach your desired consistency. For best results, store the rice separately to maintain its texture.\nYou can also use leftover curry to make kare pan (Japanese curry bread) , tamago cheese kare pan , baked kare pan, yaki curry , curry udon , curry ramen and more!\nRecipe FAQ\nMore Japanese Curry Recipes to Try Curry Udon Vegan Japanese Curry Coco Ichi Style Japanese Curry Vegan Tofu Katsu Curry Single Serving Japanese Curry Natto Curry Japanese Beef Curry (coming soon) Japanese Pork Curry (coming soon) Japanese Fish Katsu Curry (coming soon) Enjoy!!

    "text": "SEVILLA 26 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl sindicato Ustea ha comunicado este jueves que no ha firmado el 'Acuerdo sobre mejora del sistema educativo y las condiciones laborales del personal funcionario docente no universitario de Andalucía', promovido por la Consejería de Desarrollo Educativo y Formación Profesional, al considerarlo \"insuficiente, excluyente y sin garantías de estabilidad\".\nSegún ha explicado Ustea, la negativa responde tanto a razones de fondo como de forma, tal y como detallan en una nota de prensa. \"El acuerdo no da respuesta a las necesidades reales de la escuela pública andaluza ni a las reivindicaciones históricas del profesorado\", ha afirmado el sindicato.\nPara la organización, el texto es insuficiente porque según ellos, no contempla una bajada de ratios con impacto inmediato, no garantiza un aumento estructural y consolidado de las plantillas, no aborda de forma real la reducción del horario lectivo, ni mejora la atención a la diversidad, y deja fuera etapas educativas como la Formación Profesional, las enseñanzas artísticas o de régimen especial.\nAdemás, Ustea ha advertido de que muchas de las medidas incluidas dependen de financiación externa, principalmente de fondos europeos, \"sin garantías de estabilidad ni continuidad\", lo que, a juicio del sindicato, pone en riesgo la consolidación de los recursos humanos y materiales.\nEn cuanto al proceso negociador, Ustea ha criticado que ha sido \"poco transparente y desequilibrado\", señalando que se han producido negociaciones bilaterales al margen de las mesas oficiales y que el sindicato ha sido excluido por ser \"el más exigente\". Añaden que el acuerdo se hizo público antes incluso de su firma oficial, lo que, según Ustea, evidencia \"una falta total de rigor y voluntad de diálogo real\".",

    "text": "Toño Mauri tiene una bacteria en los pulmones y su situación ha generado inquietud en su entorno más cercano y sus compañeros de la industria. El artista, uno de los más representativos de\nMéxico, es un sobreviviente del COVID-19, ya que sobrevivió a la infección en 2020.\nLa\ncelebridad tuvo un trasplante doble de pulmón para resistir a las consecuencias del coronavirus, durante la primera etapa de la pandemia, una de las más trágicas y que se llevó millones de vidas en todo el mundo.\nDe esta manera, desde hace tres años,\nMauri es un agradecido por seguir respirando a pesar de su situación crítica de ese entonces. Sin embargo, en diciembre de 2023, informó que ha tenido una nueva complicación de su salud.\nLe han detectado una bacteria en los pulmones.\n¿Cuál es su estado de salud? ¿qué le dijeron los médicos sobre su diagnóstico? El mismo Toño Mauri lo contó en una entrevista al programa “Sale el Sol”.\n¿POR QUÉ TOÑO MAURI TIENE UNA BACTERIA EN LOS PULMONES?\nToño Mauri contó que los médicos hallaron una bacteria en sus pulmones y que debe hacer un tratamiento de 50 días para evitar complicaciones en su salud, sobre todo por el trasplante doble de estos órganos que tuvo en 2020, al contagiarse de coronavirus.\n“En mis últimos chequeos resultó que apareció una bacteria que es muy común en quienes tenemos un trasplante. Es una bacteria a la que hay que tenerle cuidado. El doctor prefirió que entremos en tratamiento antes de que pudiera hacer algún daño”, declaró en “Sale el Sol”.\n¿Cuáles son las complicaciones que puede traer esta bacteria? Mauri explicó que esta se puede haber alojado en sus pulmones el mismo día del trasplante y que, de no hacer el tratamiento a tiempo, podría generarle incluso una neumonía.\n“Es una bacteria agresiva y provoca abscesos en los pulmones o neumonía. El doctor prefirió que tomara el tratamiento. Me pusieron un catéter abajo de la piel que va directo al corazón, y el corazón distribuye el antibiótico a todo el cuerpo”, detalló.\n¿CUÁL ES EL ESTADO DE SALUD DE TOÑO MAURI?\nEl estado de salud de Toño Mauri es estable, porque ya tiene el tratamiento adecuado para frenar los efectos de la bacteria en sus pulmones. Lo que sí pidió es fuerzas para superar sin problemas los 50 días de lucha contra la bacteria.",

    "text": "Jason Cohen Daily Caller News Foundation The New York Times’ Mara Gay on Wednesday seemed to suggest that Judge Juan Merchan should maintain his gag order on former President Donald Trump to safeguard voters. Trump’s [gag order](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/15/frustrating-fox-news-legal-analyst-rips-judge-for-gagging-trump-but-not-known-liar-michael-cohen/), imposed by Merchan, bars the former president from making public statements regarding witnesses, prosecutors other than the district attorney, court staff and jurors, as well as family members of the staff, district attorney or judge. [Gay](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/17/msnbc-analyst-fears-trump-dangerously-trial/) on “Deadline: White House” appeared to imply during a conversation about the necessity of the gag order that it protects both the jurors who convicted Trump as well as American voters.

So, this is a moment to throw everything that democracy has at this man.” Trump is still under the gag order despite his trial being over, with the former president’s attorneys [asking](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/nyregion/trump-trial-conviction-gag-order.html) Merchan on Tuesday to lift the prohibition on his speech. However, Democratic Manhattan District Alvin Bragg’s office [defended](https://dailycaller.com/2024/06/05/alvin-braggs-trump-stay-gag-order-conviction/) on Wednesday keeping Trump under the gag order, asking that it remain in place at least through the former president’s sentencing hearing in July and any post-trial motions. “The gag order doesn’t prevent Donald Trump from making any and all political attacks against Joe Biden and his administration … There’s a carve-out for the judge himself, who has been attacked. And there’s a carve-out for Alvin Bragg,” MSNBC legal analyst Andrew Weissmann said before Gay’s comments. “What it is doing is protecting witnesses and jurors. And this is one where the district attorney has asked for both sides to brief this issue, but they’re clearly going to take the position that you can’t tell witnesses and jurors, ‘hey we’re going to protect you just during the trial, but after the trial you’re on your own.’ The judge is not an idiot.” MSNBC analyst [John Heilemann](https://dailycaller.com/2024/05/15/morning-joe-host-rages-nyt-polls-showing-biden-behind-trump/) chimed in to add it would be “absolutely bonkers” for Merchan to lift the gag order before Gay’s comments. An MSNBC panel in May burst into [laughter](https://dailycaller.com/2024/05/15/msnbc-panel-laughs-about-trump-mouth-shut-during-trial/) about Trump’s inability to conduct a typical reelection campaign because the gag order hampering his speech, connecting the order to the former president’s upcoming debate with President Joe Biden where microphones will be silenced during the other candidate’s speaking time. “Donald Trump does have some experience with having his mic cut off. Which is he’s been sitting in court and wanting very badly to respond to everything with his mic cut off,” NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen said, prompting laughter from his fellow panelists. “So it’ll be interesting to see if he’s able to do that in a debate. But he has definitely had his mouth shut over the course of the last several weeks.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
