Supporti speciali di stampa in quattro secoli di tipografia nelle collezioni della Biblioteca Palatina\nDal 17 Novembre 2024 al 26 Gennaio 2025\nParma\nLuogo: Complesso monumentale della Pilotta\nIndirizzo: Piazza della Pilotta 15\nOrari: martedì-domenica dalle 10,30 alle 19,00 (ultimo ingresso ore 18,00). Lunedì chiuso Aperture e chiusure straordinarie: lunedì 6 gennaio aperto, martedì 7 gennaio chiuso lunedì 13 gennaio aperto, martedì 14 gennaio chiuso\nCuratori: Andrea De Pasquale\nCosto del biglietto: La mostra è visitabile con il biglietto di ingresso al Complesso monumentale della Pilotta, comprensivo dell’accesso ai musei al suo interno (Teatro Farnese, Galleria Nazionale, Galleria Petitot della Biblioteca Palatina, Museo Archeologico e Museo Bodoniano)\nSito ufficiale: [http://complessopilotta.it](http://complessopilotta.it)\nLa collezione bodoniana conservata in Biblioteca Palatina vanta numerose edizioni stampate dal grande tipografo saluzzese su diverse tipologie di carta, su pergamena e su seta. Traendo spunto da questa varietà, ben rappresentata in mostra, si intende più ampiamente valorizzare quanto conservato nel Complesso monumentale della Pilotta, esponendo una selezione di volumi a stampa, dai primi prodotti tipografici (gli “incunaboli” nati tra 1450 e 1500) fino a quelli di metà ’800, realizzati su varie tipologie di carta nonché supporti diversi da essa, quali pergamena, seta, legno.\nL’interesse per la raccolta di edizioni su pergamena trova nella Biblioteca Palatina uno dei suoi più significativi esempi, come testimonia il fondo posseduto, assai cospicuo e pressoché unico per la quantità e la rarità di alcuni pezzi, nel panorama delle biblioteche italiane, frutto di origini diverse e di distinte provenienze.\nIl percorso espositivo è suddiviso in quattro sezioni, evidenziate da altrettanti pannelli esplicativi, come i supporti di stampa presi in considerazione:\nPergamena: dagli incunaboli alle edizioni ottocentesche (qui la tipografia “imita” il manoscritto anche nel supporto);\nSeta, utilizzata da Giambattista Bodoni per alcuni rarissimi esemplari;\nCarta colorata, a mano e colorata nella pasta;\nLegno, nelle sperimentazioni del conte Stefano Sanvitale del suo Album de’ tentativi sù fogli lignei (1830).\nAmpiamente testimoniata, oltre alla collezione bodoniana, l’accanita ricerca di Bartolomeo Gamba (1766-1841) e di altri bibliofili, protagonisti di un’attività volta a raccogliere esemplari di emissioni su carte di vari colori (dall’azzurro più diffuso, al verde, al giallo, al rosa), ottenute con la coloritura della pasta di stracci impiegata per la fabbricazione di tale supporto, spingendo quindi numerosi tipografi a produrle in pochissimi esemplari (se non in copia unica), specialmente per occasioni particolari quali doni di nozze.\nLa mostra è organizzata con il contributo della Fondazione Cariparma, della Fondazione Monte Parma e del Ministero della Cultura.\n[SCARICA IL COMUNICATO IN PDF](#_)\n-\n[Dal 06 dicembre 2024 al 18 maggio 2025 Biella | Palazzo Gromo Losa e Palazzo Ferrero](/calendario-arte/biella/mostra-steve-mccurry-uplands-icons-99995)Steve McCurry.

    "text": "Jammu, Oct 24: A meeting of Traffic Police officers of Traffic City Jammu and Traffic Rural Jammu to review their preparedness to meet the winter traffic Police challenges was held at RTHQ Narwal Jammu under the chair of DIG Traffic Jammu Dr. Mohd. Haseeb Mughal, IPS. Vinay Kumar, JKPS Traffic Rural Jammu, Mohd. Faisal Qureshi, JKPS Traffic City Jammu, Arvinder Singh Kotwal, JKPS Addl. SP Traffic City Jammu, Voonesh Kumar, Sr. Prosecuting Officer RTHQ Jammu, Smt.

(S) Ruby Dhar-RTHQ Jammu and Inspr. Suraj Pathania Traffic City Jammu, Since the vehicular traffic pressure increases manifold in Jammu city due to the additional Govt activities in Jammu City coupled with huge migration of population to Jammu from across the J&K in view of winter season. The traffic Police functioning remains utmost significant to ensure that no traffic jamming takes place in Jammu city and overall life activities take place with ease. The deployment of traffic Police for the VIP routes and of other traffic congestion points were discussed. While addressing the officers, DIG Traffic Jammu said that in no case the essential services including medical emergencies should be affected during peak hours. The officers were directed to identify available places for parking of the vehicles and get them earmarked/notified so that people are made aware of the same in order to avoid traffic jamming on the routes during winter months. No old/junk-accidental/un warranted vehicle should remain parked on the road side, which many a times is not only a cause of traffic congestion but also contributes to serious accidents, he added. The traffic Police officers were directed to liaise with all private school managements and convey them that no parking of school vehicles shall be allowed on the road sides/streets. These school buses on public spaces is causing a great inconvenience to the general public and oftenly contribute to avoidable traffic congestions. Officers were also directed to liaise with road construction agencies and convey them not to occupy unwanted space of the roads wherever road construction work is going on, so that hassle free movement of the traffic is not hampered. The officers were advised to exercise maximum use of PA systems for public awareness with regard to traffic violations and other road safety measures. DIG Traffic Jammu also advised all the traffic Police officers immediately rush to the accident spot in their areas of responsibilities specially in case of fatal accidents for rescue purpose and to examine the accident spot to find out the cause of the accident as well as taking remedial measures for rectification of black spot, so that further chance of such accidents are minimized. No pressure horns be allowed in the transport vehicles, as which causes great inconvenience to the general public especially during late hours in residential areas, for which traffic Police officers should liaise with transport organizations for the awareness of the drivers and also aware them with regard to the traffic Police action against such menace, he added. It was made clear to all the officers that Traffic management during winters is always challenging and everybody has to put in his/her sincere and hard efforts to make it smooth.",

    "text": "OpenAI is launching GPT-4.5 today, its newest and largest AI language model. GPT-4.5 will be available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users to start. OpenAI is calling the release its “most knowledgable model yet.” but its not a frontier model and might not perform as well as o1 or o3-mini, The Verge reported.\nGPT-4.5 will have better writing capabilities, improved world knowledge, and what OpenAI calls a “refined personality over previous models.” OpenAI says interacting with GPT 4.5 will feel more “natural,” adding that the model is better at recognizing patterns and drawing connections, making it ideal for writing, programming, and “solving practical problems.”\nHowever, OpenAI notes that it won’t introduce enough new capabilities to be considered a frontier model. “GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model, but it is OpenAI’s largest LLM, improving on GPT-4’s computational efficiency by more than 10x,” OpenAI says in a document that leaked ahead of its announcement.\n“It does not introduce 7 net-new frontier capabilities compared to previous reasoning releases and its performance is below that of o1, o3-mini, and deep research on most preparedness evaluations.”\nCNBC reported: OpenAI on Thursday announced the research preview of GPT-4.5, a general-purpose large language model. It will initially be open to software developers and people with ChatGPT Pro subscriptions.\nThe model presents inaccurate information less frequently than predecessors, OpenAI said in a blog post.\n“Early testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater ‘EQ’ make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming and solving practical problems,” OpenAI wrote. GPT-4.5 demonstrated a lower hallucination rate than OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 models in one test, the company said in a report accompanying Thursday’s release.\nThe release nevertheless represents progress for one of the most highly prized startups in the world. Last month CNBC reported that OpenAI was in discussions on a $40 billion funding round at $350 billion valuation.\nVentureBeat reported: It’s here: OpenAI has announced the release of GBT-4.5, a research preview of its latest and most powerful language model (LLM) for chat applications — yet pointedly, the company says specifically in the model’s system card (a report outlining its capabilities, which leaked early online.)\n“GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model, but it is OpenAI’s largest LLM, improving in GPT-4’s computational efficiency by more than 10x”\nIt’s also not a “reasoning model,” the new class of models offered by OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, and many others that produce “chains-of-thought,” or stream-of-consciousness like text block in which they reflect on their own assumptions and conclusions to try and catch errors before serving up responses /outputs to users. It’s still more of a classical LLM.",

    "title": "Heart Disease: 5 Easy Ways to Reduce Sodium in Your Diet",
    "text": "Share on Pinterest New research finds that a majority of people living with heart disease consume too much sodium. Getty Images Maintaining a low sodium diet is standard advice for people with heart disease and those looking to prevent it. However, new research suggests people with heart disease are more likely to consume more sodium than recommended. Cardiologists and dietitians explained why it can be challenging to minimize sodium intake and tips for doing so. Consuming a diet low in sodium is common advice for people with heart disease. It’s a differentiating factor between the Mediterranean and DASH diets — the latter focuses on reducing sodium intake.\nResearch suggests adherence to the DASH diet can lower heart disease risk factors.\nDespite the mounting data and recommendations, a new study indicates that people living with heart disease are more likely to consume double the recommended amount of sodium.\nThe new research will be presented on Sunday, April 7, at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session.\n“This study shows that more education and decision tools are needed to help people limit sodium intake,” says Dr. Robert Salazar , MD, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann in Houston, who was not involved in the study.\nThe American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to a maximum of 2,300 milligrams daily. However, the AHA adds that the ideal daily limit is 1,500 mg for adults, particularly those living with hypertension , and that reducing intake even further — to 1,000 mg daily — can boost heart health.\nWhile sodium is essential, consuming too much can affect the heart.\n“Excess sodium intake results in high blood pressure , forcing the heart to work harder than normal to maintain adequate circulation,” Salazar says.\nSalazar adds that consuming too much sodium can increase retention, prompting leg swelling and shortness of breath from lung congestion (or pulmonary edema ). A low sodium diet can combat this risk.\n“Having the knowledge of how certain food ingredients and dietary patterns affect the risk for developing heart disease can help to optimize quality of life, particularly since there are hereditary risk factors that are out of one’s control,” says Lena Bakovic , MS, RDN, CNSC, a registered dietitian with Top Nutrition Coaching, who was not involved in the study. “Diet, conversely, can be controlled and is an important risk factor to consider for cardiovascular illness.”\nExperts discussed what the study tells us and what people can do to reduce their sodium intake, which can contribute to improved heart health.\nHow the link between high sodium and heart disease was studied To perform the study, the authors pulled data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of more than 3,100 patients who had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and coronary artery disease .\nThe patients participated in the survey from 2009-18 and filled out questionnaires about everything they consumed in 24 hours. The people with cardiovascular disease had an average daily sodium intake of 3,096 mg, and 89% of participants with heart disease consumed above the 1,500 mg daily recommended amount.\nResearchers accounted for age, sex, race, and education and did not find differences between socioeconomic groups.\n“The study results were a representation of the challenges that people face in estimating the amount of sodium they consume,” Bakovic says.\nProviders feel it’s essential to change that to improve the lives of patients with heart disease. Still, the study had its limitations.\n“This study relied on a food recall questionnaire to determine sodium intake. This method can be very imprecise,” says Dr. Bradley Serwer , MD, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, who was not involved in the study. “Patients are expected to know exactly what and how much they ate. Unless they wrote it down and measured the food directly, their response is an estimation at best. The gold standard is to collect urine for 24 hours and measure the sodium levels, but this is difficult and cumbersome.”\nStill, Serwer believes the data holds weight and is a call to action for healthcare professionals.\n“We have to be persistent and repetitive to relay how important a low sodium diet truly is to your cardiac health,” Serwer says.\nWhy do people consume too much sodium? The idea that consuming too much sodium can affect the heart isn’t news. However, providers share that the new research highlights the importance of continued consumer education.\n“It sheds light on the fact that despite being aware of the risks and recommendations for sodium reduction, many individuals with heart disease still consume excessively high levels of sodium,” says Michelle Routhenstein , RD, a preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com.\nThat may sound ironic — if people are educated, why the need for continued education? However, reducing sodium intake is challenging for several reasons.\n“Many people are unaware of the sodium content in the foods they consume or underestimate how much sodium they’re consuming daily,” Routhenstein says. “Without actively checking food labels and being mindful of sodium content, individuals may unknowingly consume excessive amounts.”\nFor one, salt isn’t always palatable.\n“These foods may not taste notably salty, so individuals may not realize the high sodium content ,” Routhenstein says.\nOn the other hand?\n“Salt tastes good and makes our food taste better,” Serwer says.\nIt can be challenging to give that up.\nAnd nutrition labels aren’t available at restaurants (though some, especially chains, have nutrition facts posted online and on menus).\n“People may be taking in more sodium than they realize if they frequently eat out at restaurants versus at home, where there is a more controlled environment and ability to monitor added sodium. In a restaurant setting, this is virtually impossible to do,” Bakovic says.\nA 2020 study of more than 2,500 people ten years old and older indicated that eating one meal per week outside of the home was linked to higher sodium intake.\nSimple ways to reduce your salt intake While challenging, reducing sodium intake is possible. Experts shared the following tips that can help.\nMake a game plan for the grocery store Routhenstein suggests spending most of your time on the grocery store’s perimeter.\n“Avoid aisles if possible, and choose foods in their whole — not packaged — state,” Routhenstein says. “When choosing foods from grocery store aisles and frozen food sections, there is an increased likelihood that one would be choosing food products that are much higher in sodium content and are likely abundantly processed.”\nRead the labels When browsing packaged foods, take a peek at the nutrition labels and look for signs a food may have too much sodium.\n“Becoming sodium-savvy can help an individual to feel more confident in their food choices and to choose lower sodium food products,” Bakovic says. “Generally speaking, a low sodium food would be one with 5% or less of the daily value for sodium in the ‘percentage of daily value column’ of a nutrition facts label.”\n“Watch for different wording for sodium,” Bakovic says. “Examples of that would be monosodium glutamate, disodium guanylate, disodium inosinate, and Kosher salt.”\nUse other seasonings Cooking at home can help reduce sodium intake, but dietitians stressed avoiding excessive salt shaking is important.\nInstead, Routhenstein recommends flavoring foods with:\nCitrus juices, such as lemon or grapefruit Chili peppers Garlic powder Oregano powder Dijon, whole grain, or dry mustard Dining out strategies Eating out isn’t off the table, and people can take steps to reduce sodium intake at restaurants.\n“When eating out, ask for sauces and dressings on the side,” Routhenstein says. “Choose grilled or steamed options over fried, and request meals to be prepared without added salt.”\nSeek help managing your sodium intake As this new research suggests, reducing sodium intake can be a challenge, but it’s one you don’t have to take on alone.\n“A nutritionist or registered dietitian can help make a plan for reducing sodium intake,” Salazar says. “People can also talk to their physician about strategies to reduce sodium intake.”\nIf you’d like to speak with a registered dietitian, Routhenstein suggests using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ “find an expert” tool, which allows people to filter by location and specialty.",

    "title": "Emergenza pediatri: se in Italia ne mancano 500, solo in Piemonte ne servono 108. Gimbe: \"Bisogna garantire l'assistenza ai più piccoli\"",
    "text": "Solo la Lombardia sta peggio del Piemonte. In Italia, soprattutto in alcune regioni, esplode l'allarme pediatri e il nostro territorio si scopre fragile, nell'assistenza ai pazienti più piccoli. L'allarme arriva dalla Fondazione Gimbe, che registra come in tutto il Paese manchino 500 pediatri. Di questi, 108 solo in Piemonte. Fa peggio la Lombardia con 180, mentre il Veneto ne reclama 93.\nIn alcune aree si supera il massimale di 1.000 assistiti per pediatra mentre entro il 2028 ne andranno in pensione 2.598, si legge nell'ultimo report del Gimbe. Si tratta di quel medico preposto alla tutela della salute di bambini e ragazzi di età compresa tra 0 e 13 anni. Ad ogni bambino, sin dalla nascita, deve essere assegnato un pediatra di libera scelta per accedere a servizi e prestazioni inclusi nei Livelli essenziali di assistenza garantiti dal Servizio sanitario nazionale. \"Le segnalazioni sulla difficoltà di accesso – afferma Nino Cartabellotta, presidente della Fondazione Gimbe – arrivano oggi da tutte le Regioni, evidenziando criticità ricorrenti: complessità burocratiche, carenza di risposte da parte delle Aziende Sanitarie Locali (Asl), pediatri con un numero elevato di assistiti e impossibilità, per molte famiglie, di iscrivere i propri figli a un Pls. Una situazione che genera disagi rilevanti e richiede interventi organizzativi urgenti, per garantire la continuità dell’assistenza pediatrica, soprattutto ai più piccoli e ai più fragili\".\nSecondo i dati il 75,7% delle carenze si concentra in 3 sole grandi Regioni del Nord: Lombardia (180), Piemonte (108), Veneto (93). Al contrario, in 9 Regioni (Basilicata, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Marche, Molise, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicilia e Umbria) non si rileva alcuna carenza, poiché la media di assistiti per Pls è inferiore a 850.\n\"In realtà – precisa Cartabellotta – è necessario considerare due aspetti fondamentali. Anzitutto, l’ultimo Acn ha innalzato il rapporto ottimale da 600 a 850, 'assorbendo' di fatto una quota consistente delle carenze registrate al primo gennaio 2023. In secondo luogo, una stima su base regionale non intercetta le carenze localizzate, che si manifestano in territori a bassa densità abitativa, zone disagiate, aree montane\".\nIl progressivo calo delle nascite sta modificando in modo significativo la platea di assistiti dei Pls. I dati Istat documentano una costante riduzione dei bambini della fascia 0-5 anni, per la quale l’iscrizione al Pls è obbligatoria: tra il 1 gennaio 2019 e il 1 gennaio 2025 si contano circa 430 mila potenziali assistiti in meno per pediatri. \"Di conseguenza nello stesso periodo – osserva il presidente – il crollo delle nascite ha ridotto, su scala nazionale, il fabbisogno di Pls di oltre 500 unità in soli 6 anni\". Ma questo non ha evitato l'emergenza.\nSecondo i dati 2024 forniti dalla Federazione italiana dei medici pediatri (Fimp), tra il 2024 e il 2028 andranno in pensione 2.598 pediatri di libera scelta, avendo raggiunto il limite massimo di età previsto, pari a 70 anni (salvo deroghe): dai 333 pediatri di libera scelta del Lazio a 3 in Valle d’Aosta. Il numero di borse di studio per la scuola di specializzazione in pediatria, rimasto stabile per un decennio, ha registrato un incremento significativo negli ultimi 6 anni: da 496 borse nell’anno accademico 2017-2018 a 853 nel 2023-2024, con un picco di 973 nell’anno accademico 2020-2021.\nSecondo l’Annuario Statistico 2023, pubblicato dal ministero della Salute, nel 2023 i Pls in attività erano 6.706, ovvero 702 in meno rispetto al 2019 (-9,5%). A preoccupare è anche il progressivo invecchiamento della categoria: la quota di pediatri di libera scelta con oltre 23 anni di specializzazione è passata dal 39% nel 2009 al 77% nel 2023, segno di un ricambio generazionale sempre più rallentato.",

    "text": "Notre Dame cross welcomed by Christian world\nThe reinstallation of the cross at Notre Dame Cathedral has been welcomed by Christians across the world.\nThe iconic cross at the apse of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, which remarkably survived the devastating fire of 2019, was reinstalled late last week following meticulous restoration efforts by skilled ironworkers from Normandy.\nMeasuring 12 metres and weighing 1.5 tonnes, this cross is a symbol of resilience and faith, being the only part of the choir roof that withstood the flames.\nThe reinstallation marks a significant milestone in the extensive restoration project that has engaged around 250 companies and hundreds of craftsmen, architects, and professionals. The collective aim is to reopen the cathedral by December this year.\nThe fire that struck on 15 April, 2019, caused catastrophic damage, including the collapse of Notre Dame's spire and part of its roof. Five years later, significant repairs have been achieved, notably with the reinstallation of the spire's lead-covered needle. Yet, much of the cathedral remains enveloped in scaffolding. The spire alone is surrounded by 70,000 pieces of scaffolding, weighing a total of 600 tonnes, indicating the immense scale and complexity of the restoration efforts.\nNotre Dame Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a profound symbol of Christianity, once welcomed 12 million visitors annually. The fire was a severe blow, but the global community responded with overwhelming support, pledging over $1 billion for the rebuilding efforts. Investigations into the fire concluded that an electrical short circuit was the most likely cause.\nThe dedication and craftsmanship involved in restoring Notre Dame reflect a global commitment to preserving this historic Christian landmark for future generations.\nAs the restoration progresses, the reinstallation and raising of the cross will serve as a powerful reminder of faith, resilience and Christian renewal.",
