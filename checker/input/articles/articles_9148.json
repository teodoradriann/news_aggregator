    "text": "Michigan study links marijuana use to lower birth weights\nLANSING – A new study on pregnant women found a possible link between cannabis use and smaller newborns, but says more research is needed to see if a cause-and-effect relationship exists.\nThe study by researchers at Henry Ford Health’s Center for Health Policy & Health Services Research and Michigan State University found that around 15% of pregnant women surveyed in 23 clinics across the state acknowledged using cannabis during their pregnancies.\nAssessing “adverse outcomes” of cannabis on fetal growth has important potential long-term implications, including obesity and higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, the study said.\nResearchers noted an earlier study showing cannabis use by pregnant women in Michigan doubled from 2007 to 2017. Medical marijuana use has been legal in Michigan since 2008, and recreational use since 2018.\nThe survey took place from 2017 to 2022.\nRelated:\nTo focus on the effects of cannabis, the study excluded pregnant women who used alcohol or tobacco.\nLead author Alyssa Vanderziel, a scientist at the Henry Ford center, began work on the study while getting her Ph.D. at MSU.\n“It would be incorrect to say that using cannabis during pregnancy causes smaller size. We simply detected a significant association, which is important,” Vanderziel said.\nJames Anthony, a coauthor from MSU’s College of Human Medicine, said cannabis research is still misunderstood due to its label as a Schedule 1 drug under federal law.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration defines Schedule 1 substances as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n“We are left with a body of non-definitive evidence and a policy that blocks scientists in their attempts to address the uncertainties. We hope each study will be a step forward and not a step backward,” Anthony said.\nPaul Armentano, the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), said he wasn’t surprised by the study, which was published in the American Journal on Addictions.\n“Prior studies have linked smoke inhalation, albeit tobacco smoking or cannabis smoking, with lower birth weight so this result is not particularly surprising,” Armentano said.\n“That said, these results are often muddied by confounders, as women who smoke during pregnancy also often tend to receive poorer prenatal health care, are more likely to be socioeconomically underprivileged, and potentially engage in other behaviors that may also influence birth weight” Armentano said.\nVanderziel said, “We need more quality research to be able to make strong public health statements and clinical recommendations and guidelines for our clinicians to follow to be able to provide the best care.”\nThis story was originally published by the Capital News Service.\nSee what new members are saying about why they donated to Bridge Michigan:\n- “In order for this information to be accurate and unbiased it must be underwritten by its readers, not by special interests.” - Larry S.\n- “Not many other media sources report on the topics Bridge does.” - Susan B.\n- “Your journalism is outstanding and rare these days.” - Mark S.\nIf you want to ensure the future of nonpartisan, nonprofit Michigan journalism, please become a member today.

    "title": "Illinois star Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended following rape charge",
    "text": "Illinois basketball star Terrence Shannon Jr. has been suspended from all team activities after he was charged with rape. A warrant was issued for Shannon’s arrest on Wednesday by the Douglas County district attorney’s office in Kansas. Shannon turned himself in on Thursday on a charge of “rape; sexual intercourse without consent and use of force,” according to ESPN’s Myron Medcalf . The senior posted $50,000 bail and planned to return to Illinois. Illinois said in a statement that the alleged incident took place in September when Shannon was in Lawrence, Kansas, to attend the Illinois-Kansas State football game. Shannon was “not in Lawrence on official University business, nor was he a member of the University’s travel party,” according to the school. University officials said they were aware of the investigation involving Shannon but that they did not receive “actionable information” until the arrest warrant was issued. Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said the school has “zero tolerance for sexual misconduct” but that student-athletes are afforded “appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations.” Shannon’s attorney, Mark P. Sutter, said in a statement that Shannon has cooperated with authorities since the allegations were made in September. Sutter said Shannon is “innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.” Shannon, who transferred to Illinois from Texas Tech following the 2020-21 season, is averaging a team-high 21.7 points per game. He has been the 11th-ranked Illini’s best player. The post Illinois star Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended following rape charge appeared first on Larry Brown Sports . Want more great sports stories?

    "text": "\"2023 marcou o avanço do combate à criminalidade no Brasil\", diz Cappelli Ministro em exercício da Justiça fez balanço positivo sobre as ações de combate ao crime organizado [edit]() ✅ Receba as notícias do Brasil 247 e da TV 247 no [canal do Brasil 247](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va5CrrPD38COKOxDbM1M) e na [comunidade 247](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LnWE97DQIKF4fpwivt0f3h) no WhatsApp. 247 – No programa \"A Voz do Brasil\" do dia 29 de dezembro de 2023, o Ministro em exercício da Justiça e Segurança Pública, Ricardo Cappelli, anunciou avanços significativos nos índices de criminalidade no Brasil ao longo do ano. Em uma entrevista, ele compartilhou dados e estratégias adotadas que resultaram em quedas expressivas em diversos indicadores. \"Em 2023, tivemos redução de homicídios, latrocínio, roubo de carros e cargas, além de queda no feminicídio. Foram reduções em todos os índices como consequência do trabalho que fizemos ao longo do ano\", afirmou Cappelli. Ele destacou que essa diminuição nos índices de violência ocorreu nos 10 primeiros meses de 2023, quando comparados com o mesmo período de 2022. O ministro enfatizou que a expectativa da pasta é que a redução de mortes violentas intencionais chegue a 6%. \"Esse resultado é muito expressivo, principalmente porque estamos tratando do primeiro ano do governo. Política de segurança pública não é sair por aí atirando a esmo, acertando inocentes, mas sim agir com inteligência, com planejamento\", ressaltou. Cappelli esclareceu que o decreto sobre o controle responsável de armas, assinado pelo presidente da República, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, é uma das principais medidas que reflete nos dados apresentados pelo MJSP. \"Criar critérios rígidos para que a pessoa possa ter uma arma trouxe consequências objetivas, provando que mais armas não significa mais segurança. Muito pelo contrário, a gente reduziu as armas e isso diminuiu todos os índices de violência do Brasil\", afirmou. Os resultados do levantamento sobre a redução da criminalidade podem ser conferidos no site do MJSP, que utiliza o Sinesp Validador de Dados Estatísticos (Sinesp VDE) para coletar informações. Essa plataforma, usada por todos os 26 estados e pelo Distrito Federal, otimiza a eficiência na transmissão de dados de segurança pública. \"A gente tem insistido no SUSP, no Sistema Único de Segurança Pública, que envolve desde o guarda municipal até a Força Nacional. O nosso desafio na segurança pública é integrar todos esses agentes para que, de forma coordenada, baseada em dados, evidências e informações objetivas, a gente consiga planejar e agir com inteligência para reduzir esses índices\", finalizou Cappelli.
