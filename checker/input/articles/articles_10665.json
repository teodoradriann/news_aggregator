    "text": "By Courtney Potter It’s a sure-to-be-thrilling way to kick off the new year... The good folks at Marvel Studios will soon present Echo, spotlighting Maya Lopez as she’s pursued by Wilson Fisk’s criminal empire. When the journey brings her home, she’s forced to confront her own family and legacy. Echo stars Alaqua Cox (Hawkeye) as Maya Lopez, as well as Chaske Spencer (Wild Indian, The English), Tantoo Cardinal (Killers of the Flower Moon, Stumptown), Devery Jacobs (FX’s Reservation Dogs, American Gods), Zahn McClarnon (Dark Winds, FX’s Reservation Dogs), and Cody Lightning (Hey, Viktor!, Four Sheets to the Wind)—with Graham Greene (1883, Goliath) and Vincent D’Onofrio (Hawkeye, Daredevil, Law & Order: Criminal Intent), who returns to the villainous role of Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin. Episodes of the series are directed by Sydney Freeland (Navajo) and Catriona McKenzie (Gunaikurnai); Kevin Feige, Stephen Broussard, Louis D’Esposito, Brad Winderbaum, Victoria Alonso, Richie Palmer, Jason Gavin (Blackfeet), Marion Dayre, and Sydney Freeland are executive producers, and Jennifer L. Booth and Amy Rardin are co-executive producers. With Echo’s big premiere on Tuesday, January 9, we’re taking a closer look at who’s who in the highly anticipated series: Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) Maya is a force to be reckoned with. She’s skilled in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat—and is at home on her motorcycle. When she flees New York City after assassinating the crime boss Kingpin, she’s forced to reunite with the family she left long ago under tragic circumstances. “In Hawkeye, Maya was a villain,” says director Sydney Freeland. “And while she’s our protagonist in Echo, we wanted to embrace those darker sides and flaws within the character, who is on an extreme emotional journey trying to navigate the pent-up anger inside her. She’s a very nuanced character with culture and ancestry in the Choctaw community, which is something we hadn’t seen before.” In addition to the character’s cultural background, Maya’s physical prowess underscores her mental toughness and is indicative of her soon-to-be antihero status. Cox left her home on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, to join the Hawkeye cast just a few years ago. “When I jumped into the Marvel world, it was a big transition for me, but I was so grateful for the opportunity and journey,” says the actor, who learned about plans for Echo while filming Hawkeye. “I felt so overwhelmed and shocked because it was a lead role in my second project, which seemed kind of crazy. I remember telling my family and it just meant so much because it gives Indigenous people a leading character and real representation in an authentic way. It feels amazing to be able to have the opportunity inspire and empower a future generation of people.” The actor is intently aware of what the character’s physicality will mean to others in the amputee community. “I wanted to show people that amputees and people with disabilities can do anything,” says Cox. “Although I am deaf and an amputee, I was able to do a lot of my fighting and stunts—and it was important to me to show my prosthetic leg and not try to hide it under clothes. Maya Lopez is a badass, and I wanted people with disabilities to have someone that they could look up to and see within themselves.” Additionally, Cox’s Maya is the second deaf hero to join the MCU, after Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari in Eternals. It was important to filmmakers that the storytelling and approach to production embraced the character’s preferred way of communicating with others. In fact, many scenes feature no spoken dialogue; the production also provided weekly group learning sessions for the filmmakers and crew to help with the overall communication on set. “All the people on the crew were able to take sign language classes for a few months before we actually started filming, which was really cool,” says Cox. Says director Sydney Freeland, “After studying American Sign Language and talking with [consulting producer and ASL master] Doug Ridloff, one of the things that became apparent was that the hands are an extension of one’s emotion and expression. The hands are the text, and the face is the subtext, and you need those two things together to get an idea of what a person’s feeling. We built our entire visual language with that in mind.” Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio) Fisk was once known as “Uncle” to Maya, who looked up to him after relocating to New York City with her father as a child. Fisk was long ago crowned Kingpin by the NYC criminal underworld. He was rightly feared by all—nobody dared challenge Kingpin—at least not until Maya Lopez discovered that he gave the orders to have her father killed. Their final encounter ended in a gunshot... but Fisk has the kind of power that always seems to eclipse even the grimmest circumstances. “I love that Echo is Maya Lopez’s origin story,” says the actor. “You get introduced to this Native American world and it’s intense, spiritual, and deeply emotional—it’s all about her family and ancestors. Kingpin is both a physically and emotionally brutal character. There is a strong layer of a father-daughter thing with Kingpin and Maya. It’s a great way to bring out all kinds of intensities and emotions and their dynamic has this flavor that’s completely unique.” Henry “Black Crow” Lopez (Chaske Spencer) Henry is Maya’s well-intended uncle who owns the local roller-skating rink. But Henry has a troubled past that he can’t quite escape—including ties to Fisk’s criminal underworld. Spencer, who fills Uncle Henry’s shoes, says not only is his character the brother of Maya’s late father, William, he still has his hands in the very business that led to her father’s untimely death. “Henry feels guilty about his brother’s death, and there’s a lot that Maya brings to the situation that I don’t think Henry is ready to face yet,” he explains. Skully (Graham Greene) Wise, funny, and kind-natured, Skully owns the town pawn shop. He is a grandfather figure to Maya, offering his support, warmth, and guidance along the way. Unlike many of her estranged family members, Skully is willing to set aside any differences and move forward with love. “When Maya was a young child, [Skully] was going out with her grandmother, Chula,” says Greene. “Maya comes back into his life after she damages her prosthetic leg and wants him to repair it for her—it helps rekindle their relationship.” Chula (Tantoo Cardinal) Chula is Maya’s estranged grandmother. Her overwhelming anger following the tragic loss of her daughter, Maya’s mother, led to the hasty departure of Maya and her father. Maya, so young and impressionable, shared in Chula’s grief—but the distance between them has only grown in the years since they last saw each other. For Cardinal, her character’s maternal instincts are being tested by Maya so many years later. “In the beginning of the series, Maya and Chula’s relationship is pretty fractured and they are not in a good place,” the actress says. “Maya comes from strength, but she also comes from a place of confusion.” Bonnie (Devery Jacobs) Bonnie is Maya’s estranged cousin and childhood best friend who works as an EMT in Tamaha, Oklahoma. She and Maya were like sisters as kids, and Bonnie took it hard when Maya left. She’d love nothing more than to be close again with Maya. “Maya Lopez is so badass, and she goes through the world very guarded,” says Jacobs. “But it’s through glimpses of interacting with Bonnie that we really get to see Maya’s heart and vulnerability.” Biscuits (Cody Lightning) Biscuits is Maya’s well-meaning cousin, who helps her get settled when she returns home to Oklahoma. “Biscuits is Maya’s sidekick, who provides some comic relief for her,” says Lightning. “He’s like a big, earnest puppy dog—but he’s very resourceful and always figures out a way to get things done for Maya. He’s very loyal and will do anything for his family, even if that means getting into some trouble.”",

    "title": "Israeli artist paints the homes of evacuees forced to flee due to war - Israel Culture",
    "text": "Jordana Golding is a watercolor artist who paints “building portraits.”\nClients come to her, she says, “with photos of buildings that have great significance in their lives, such as the café where they went on their first date with their spouse, or their childhood home, or somewhere else, and I paint it in watercolor.”\nSince Oct. 7 , Golding has been reaching out to people from the South and the North who have lost their homes or been displaced.\nShe wants to get the message across to any of them who would like a painting of their homes. “For those kinds of commissions, I do it free of charge. Obviously, I couldn’t take money for such a thing, and I would just love to reach more people.”\nGolding just wants “to help everyone have that memory because it must be so terrible for them,” she says. DESTROYED HOUSE (credit: Jordana Golding)\nSHE BEGAN painting buildings at age 21, when her parents sold their family home in the UK.\n“I wanted a picture for me and my family and I love painting, so I went back to London to visit and took photos of the house – and then came home to paint it,” she explains.\n“I painted it, and then my sister-in-law, who is very artistic herself, said: ‘Great! I want you to do the house I just bought with your brother.’ So I did that. And then, through word of mouth, I got more and more commissions. I used my marketing background and started to advertise, and then I got strangers asking me to do buildings of significance to them,” she recounts.\n“And then, in the war, it occurred to me that people were losing their homes for the worst reasons possible – not for good reasons such as I am used to, like clients who say ‘We got married and had to leave our childhood homes,’ but for really sad reasons.\n“And I thought: ‘These people deserve to have that memory framed – a picture of their house as they knew it before it was destroyed.’”\nGolding has already completed half a dozen commissions but is averse to sharing pictures of those paintings out of respect for the owners’ privacy.\nThey are very personal, she says.\n“I have done half a dozen for people from the South, mostly Kibbutz Re’im, one in Be’eri, one in Kfar Aza,” she says. “It’s emotional when you are painting it, knowing that none of that is there anymore, and it’s probably an army base right now. It’s emotional sending them to the clients, as they haven’t seen their houses in a while and I wish that they could only remember the good memories from it.”\nIN TERMS of technique, Golding first makes a pencil sketch, which she sends to the client to approve. “It can always be fixed at that stage.” While she copies exactly from the photos she is given, it can happen that “the images I copy might not be exactly the same as they are in people’s memories. The building might look two-dimensional in the photo and then after I draw it – because they see it in their memory, not from the photo – they say, for instance, ‘Actually, that door looked a bit different...’”\nOnce they confirm that they like the look of it, she goes ahead.\n“Then I carry on with the rest of the painting by going over the pencil lines with a black pen and then erasing the pencil, and then going in with watercolor paints and touching up here and there with the black pen.”\nGolding then continues, using very light brush strokes of opaque color (“because you really can’t move it around too much once the pigmented paints are on the page”) and keeps adding layers – “until it’s what I want.”\n“All the little bricks that you see,” she says, “I do them by hand with a tiny brush. I draw the little square and fill it in. I don’t have like a stamp or something.”\nGolding calls International Women’s Day her favorite day of the year.\n“I am definitely the biggest feminist I know,” she says.\n“I come from a line of hard-working women who are self-made, with their own businesses – even in generations where it wasn’t so acceptable to be a woman owning her business.”\nHer grandmother, she recounts, was the first woman in England to have a credit card without the need for her husband as a signatory. In those days, if a woman wanted to spend over a certain amount on her card, her husband had to authorize it.\n“That’s the kind of stories that I grew up on, and now to be a small business owner on my own is very rewarding,” she asserts.\nGolding also hails “from a house of mainly men: brothers, uncles, and my dad, of course.”\nShe considers them all “a wonderful influence,” pointing to her relationship with them as making her more boisterous and tough.\nThe artist says that Nana, her paternal grandmother, was very artistic, “and she passed it on to my dad and on to me.\n“Nana was also a business owner in London all her life with her husband, my grandfather – and so was my mother.”\nGolding’s mother was a stay-at-home-mom, which her daughter defines as “a big job.” Later, she “decided she wanted to make some money, and so she went out and did.” Golding recently discovered that her mother also liked to paint and “was actually very talented.”\n“So maybe I got it from her, after all,” her daughter says with a laugh.\nWHILE SHE knows it’s International Women’s Month , she insists that “I don’t want to forget my dad in all this because from a very young age, I was asking him to shlep me to all parts of the country, to take me to art exhibitions, to find the best art equipment and the best place to sell things. I would drive him nuts my whole childhood, and he always encouraged me.\n“He was always there to kick me up the backside, saying ‘You can do that commission, that’s not above you – you can do that.’ He dragged me to all my universities – I got accepted to the London College of Art and to five other universities to study art.”\nGolding’s parents insisted that she was only allowed to attend a school away from home if she first spent a gap year in Israel.\n“My parents insisted on it,” she said. “They said that there was a lot of anti-Zionism on campus ; that I had to be prepared and really needed to understand and know how to defend Israel against things like apartheid week, antisemitism and anti-Zionism – which we are now unfortunately seeing a lot of.”\nShe came to Israel on a gap year program and fell in love with the country. “It backfired on them,” she says, “because I came back to England after the year and said ‘I am not staying here: I want to live in Israel – and to live in Israel, I have got to do what all the other people my age are doing, which is to join the IDF.’”\nGolding looks back on the past few years with pride. “I gave up all those places” in universities and instead “became a combat soldier at checkpoints and fought a lot of terror attacks,” she said, but “always painted during every five seconds of free time I had.”  The beating heart of Tel Aviv\nCurated by Fiammetta Martegani, “The Beating Art of Tel Aviv” exhibition comprises works by Jordana Golding, Tanya Past, and Tamir Yehuda, completed “long before the war began,” Golding explains.\nSince 2022, “The Art and Soul of Tel Aviv project” has combined various artists with differing techniques who, together, “become the storytellers of the city,” explains Martegani.\n“What brings them together in their artwork is their love for the White City, the Bauhaus movement, its light, and its vibes,” the curator says. “Like an orchestra, each uses a different instrument, and all together they play the symphony of this unique place in the world, where the conductor is the city itself.\n“After five editions of this exhibition, October 7 arrived, and we asked ourselves if we could and should put together a new edition, including all the works selected just a few months before the Black Shabbat.”\nAs curator, Martegani held many discussions with Hagit Shahar, director of the Drahi Center, “about our next move.”\n“I felt so heartbroken, that I suggested changing the title and – at least for this edition – calling it “The Broken Art of Tel Aviv” instead of “The Art and Soul of Tel Aviv project.”\nBut Shahar responded: “We are not broken, we are beating!”\n“This is how we conceived this new exhibition, “The Beating Art of Tel Aviv” explains Martegani, “asking each artist to add to their works the feeling of ‘beating,’ to show the resilience of Israel in a time of war. For me, as curator, this is a crucial message to spread during such a difficult time in our lives.\n“Because, despite everything, we are still in the middle of a very long journey; we are still beating,” she says: “Like the heart – and the art – of Tel Aviv.”\nThe exhibition is scheduled to run until April 1 at the Sport and Culture Community Center, Kalisher 5, Tel Aviv. For more information, 073-3844151 or kalisher@tel-aviv.gov.il Continuity and hope despite destruction\n“I did an Instagram post for my clients abroad,” Golding said. “I took a very beautiful commission of a random picture and I destroyed it, I burnt it and punched a hole in it – and it looked horrifying and it was like: ‘If this horrifies you, imagine people losing their homes and their life.’”\nShe posted:\nTo all my clients outside of Israel, A home is where one is supposed to feel safe. You’re greeted by familiar voices and the smell of home-cooked meals. You fall asleep with the comfort of knowing that your loved ones are just in the room next door.\nThis is no longer the case in Israel. Our homes are being bombed. They’re being burnt to the ground with families inside. Terrorists broke doors down to have their way with whoever was inside. They graffitied the walls, ripped down curtains, smashed windows, and left bloody footprints. Everywhere.\nThousands of Israelis right now are living out of frantically packed suitcases in unfamiliar environments. They’ve had to leave behind family heirlooms, photos, toys, and bodies of relatives because a terrorist organization within our midst saw it fit to destroy everything and everyone in their wake, the elderly and babies included.\nA home is so much more than walls and windows, it’s where memories are built and preserved. Nobody should have it taken away from them.\n“If you or someone you know has lost a home or a business in this dreadful war and you wish to remember it for how it was before, please be in touch. I’d like to help you preserve that memory, free of charge. We’ll get through this. We don’t have a choice. Jordana.\n“It was like a ‘shock-factor’ kind of post for people not living in Israel,” Golding said, “and the curator, Fiammetta Martegani saw the post and said that the painting of the destroyed house should be in the exhibition – and the exhibition should be about continuity and hope.”\nFor more information, see Jordana Golding’s website: artbyjorderz.weebly.-com",

(Images: X - ProteasMenCSA, @backup6543, Instagram - worldofcricketmemes_) The two-match Test series between South Africa and Pakistan commenced on Thursday (December 26) at the SuperSport Park in Centurion. The hosts started well on Boxing Day by bundling out Pakistan for 211 and then scored 82 for the loss of three wickets before stumps.\nFans enjoyed the intriguing action that unfolded on the opening day of the first Test between the two teams. They expressed their reactions by sharing memes on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). One of the fans trolled star Pakistan batter Babar Azam, who failed in the first innings, falling for 4 (11) early in the day. The post was captioned:\n\"Hey Babar Azam, this isn’t Zimbabwe.\" Expand Tweet Trending Here are a few more memes:\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet South Africa pacers Dane Paterson and Corbin Bosch star with nine wickets to restrict Pakistan to 211 in the 1st Test 2024 South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to bowl first in the contest. Shan Masood (17) promoted himself to the opening position in the match to accommodate Babar Azam (4) at number three. It did not work out, as both batters departed inside the first session without scoring much. The Proteas pacers gave their side a brilliant start by reducing visitors to 56/4 in 18.3 overs.\nKamran Ghulam (54) hit a counter-attacking half-century and tried to rescue his side. However, Dane Paterson dismissed him at the end of the 38th over to give the hosts a crucial breakthrough. Mohammad Rizwan (27), Agha Salman (18), Aamer Jamal (28), and the lower order batters added some runs in the end to take Pakistan to 211. Dane Paterson picked up a five-wicket haul, while Corbin Bosch scalped four wickets for South Africa in the bowling department.\nKhurram Shahzad (2/28) and Mohammad Abbas (1/36) then bowled decently to pick up three wickets with the new ball before the conclusion of the play. Aiden Markram (47*) remained unbeaten at the crease along with Temba Bavuma (4*), with South Africa on 82/3 after 22 overs.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Yamoussoukro | Updated: 20-01-2024 00:34 IST | Created: 20-01-2024 00:34 IST - Country: - Cote d'Ivoire Ismaila Sarr scored one goal and laid on another as defending champions Senegal beat Cameroon 3-1 on Friday and booked their place in the round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaving their opponents in some peril. Sarr opened the scoring in the first half of the Group C clash in Yamoussoukro after a mistake by Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, who was playing his first game of the tournament after a late arrival in the Ivory Coast. Habib Diallo added the second goal from Sarr's cross before Jean-Charles Castelletto scored a late consolation for Cameroon. Sadio Mane completed the scoring for Senegal in injury time. The Lions of Teranga advance to the knockout rounds with a final group game against Guinea to spare. Cameroon must play Gambia in their last match. Both of those are on Tuesday. Senegal head the pool with six points from their two games, while Cameroon and Guinea have a point each and Gambia are yet to break their duck. The latter two sides meet at the same venue later on Friday.

    "text": "Enrique Gómez, excandidato presidencial y director del partido Salvación Nacional, ha figurado en redes sociales por ser uno de los principales opositores de Gustavo Petro.\n[Te puede interesar: Antonio García, comandante del ELN, dijo que no se ha evaluado prolongar cese al fuego: ”Son puros cuentos de Otty”](/colombia/2024/01/26/antonio-garcia-comandante-del-eln-dijo-que-no-se-ha-evaluado-prolongar-cese-al-fuego-son-puros-cuentos-de-otty/)\nCon sus posturas políticas sobre asuntos de trascendencia en el país, volvió a referirse a la gestión del Gobierno actual y a la polémica nominación de Gustavo Petro como Nobel de Paz.\nAhora puede seguirnos en\n WhatsApp Channel y en Google News. [Te puede interesar: Gobierno y ELN: cese al fuego bilateral será sometido a evaluación para definir nueva prórroga](/colombia/2024/01/29/gobierno-y-eln-cese-al-fuego-bilateral-sera-sometido-a-evaluacion-para-definir-nueva-prorroga/)\nA través de un video publicado en su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), Gómez aseguró que dicha nominación es solo un intento para desviar la atención ante las polémicas que han rodeado la Casa de Nariño.\n“¿Nobel para Petro? ¡No jodás! Osea, encima de eso, nos vamos a dejar engañar por esa cortina de humo frente a la incompetencia, la corrupción, los nuevos pliegos de la desastrosa licitación de los pasaportes para robarsela con el canciller Leyva”.\n[Te puede interesar: Colombia está mejor que antes del Acuerdo de Paz con las Farc, según representante de la ONU](/colombia/2024/02/01/colombia-esta-mejor-que-antes-del-acuerdo-de-paz-con-las-farc-segun-representante-de-la-onu/)\nDe acuerdo con Enrique Gómez, Petro ha mostrado ser incompetente frente a la ola de violencia que atraviesa el país y ser aliado de algunos dictadores:\n“Condena Petro la violencia aterrorizante e injustificable contra el pueblo palestino, pero ¿no contra la gente del Huila, de Arauca, o la gente de Nariño o del Cauca?, ¿Condena Petro las arbitrariedades de Israel, pero no condena las de Maduro?”\nAgregó que Gustavo Petro está entregando el país a la guerrilla y que nunca ha habido voluntad real de paz por parte de ninguno de los actores del proceso que se adelanta en Colombia con algunos grupos armados:\n“¡No jodás! ¿Ahora nos vamos a dejar distraer en ese debate? No colombianos, él mientras tanto, le está entregando el país al ELN y a las Farc, dos grupos guerrilleros que no tienen ninguna intención de desmovilizarse, ni en lo moral ni en lo material, y que están en plenas operaciones ofensivas. Están copando el territorio con la convivencia de unos comisionados de paz y de una mesa negociadora que sabe a ciencia y paciencia, que el ELN claramente ha dicho que nunca va a cesar su violencia contra el pueblo colombiano. Mientras tanto, Colombia de rodillas, la economía de rodillas.\nFinalmente, Enrique Gómez invitó a los ciudadanos que se han visto afectados por la violencia y abandono del Estado en los territorios, a interponer recursos legales para que haya mayor justicia.\n“¿Nobel para Petro? ¡No jodás! Hagamos las acciones de tutela si usted es afectado por el hecho de que han guardado las guarniciones militares y han abandonado el territorio y la defensa de la vida y de la honra de los ciudadanos, hable con el juez de su municipio y pida que esos miembros de la fuerza pública que hoy se arrodillan y violan la Constitución, tengan que actuar en su defensa”.\nAcompañando el video, el excandidato presidencial aseguró que: “Petro está entregando el país a los violentos y a los corruptos, formando y definiendo una alianza con los peores dictadores de la tierra como Maduro, Putin y los Castro”.\nEl inicio de una dictadura por parte de Gustavo Petro, señala Gómez, “es negarse a acatar la suspensión del Canciller Leyva e impedir que la fuerza pública proteja la vida, honra y bienes de los colombianos”.\nEn la misma línea que Enrique Gómez, el representante Miguel Polo Polo también cuestionó la nominación al Nobel de Paz de Gustavo Petro:\n“¿En serio un nominado al Nobel de Paz que se alzó en armas y perteneció a un grupo terrorista que mató, secuestro y torturo miles de colombianos en los 80′s? ¿En serio un nominado al Nobel de Paz que recibió financiación del narcotráfico para su campaña presidencial?”, escribió Polo Polo en su cuenta de X.\nMás Noticias\n[Rubén Torrado, del Partido de la U, puso en evidencia los trabajos mal hechos en un proyecto que tuvo una millonaria inversión](/colombia/2024/02/01/dia-sin-carro-y-sin-moto-concejal-denuncio-estado-de-ciclorrutas-y-cuestiono-contrato/)\nDía sin carro y sin moto: concejal denunció estado de ciclorrutas y cuestionó contrato\n[Autoridades buscan esclarecer las causas detrás del siniestro que cobró la vida de José Mauricio Rueda.

Os detalhes específicos do plano eram desconhecidos.\nDel Castillo afirmou que 17 pessoas foram presas por participação na tentativa de golpe, incluindo o ex-comandante Juan José Zúñiga e o ex-comandante da Marinha, Juan Arnez Salvador.

Durante uma entrevista, afirmou que Morales não poderia mais ocupar o cargo, declarando que não permitiria que “a Constituição fosse pisoteada, que desobedecesse ao mandato do povo” .\nApesar da ameaça culminar na destituição do ex-comandante, o governo não esperava que Zúñiga fosse mobilizar o exército contra Arce. “ Ninguém poderia imaginar que no dia seguinte, antes da transferência oficial dos cargos, haveria um golpe fracassado em nosso país “, declarou del Castillo.\nENTENDA O CASO Às 15h57 (horário de Brasília) de 4ª feira (26.jun), o presidente da Bolívia, Luis Arce, anunciou a tentativa de golpe depois que veículos blindados e militares estacionaram nas esquinas da Plaza Murillo, onde fica o Palácio Quemado, sede da Presidência boliviana, e a Assembleia Legislativa Plurinacional, na cidade de La Paz.\nAssista (1min39s):\nO movimento foi comandado pelo general Juan José Zúñiga , ex-comandante do Exército da Bolívia destituído na 3ª feira (25.jun) depois de criticar o ex-presidente boliviano Evo Morales.
