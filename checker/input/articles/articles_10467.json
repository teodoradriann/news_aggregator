    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Jake Smith Daily Caller News Foundation Advertisement - story continues below A second American hostage in the Gaza Strip was confirmed dead on Thursday, according to multiple reports. Judy Weinstein Haggai, a 70-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen, was confirmed dead on Thursday, roughly a week after her husband, Gadi, was also [declared](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/22/american-hostage-hamas-dead-gaza/) to have died, Israel National News [reported](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/382714). There are approximately six American hostages remaining in Gaza, [according](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-41432124?mod=world_lead_story) to The Wall Street Journal.

Their bodies remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Advertisement - story continues below The two leave behind four children and seven grandchildren, [according](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-american-judith-weinstein-was-murdered-on-oct-7-her-body-being-held-in-gaza-kibbutz/) to The Times of Israel. Judy was an English teacher who worked with special needs children, [and](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kibbutz-says-gadi-haggai-abducted-oct-7-died-in-hamas-captivity-body-held-in-gaza/) Gadi was a musician and retired chef. “[Judy was] a poet and an entrepreneur who loved to create and was dedicated to working for peace and friendship,” Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement on Thursday, according to The Times of Israel. “[Gadi was] a musician at heart, a gifted flautist, he played in the IDF Orchestra and was involved with music his whole life,” The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said in a statement reported on Friday. Hamas is currently holding about 129 hostages in Gaza, 118 of whom are Israeli citizens or dual citizens, and 23 of whom are believed to be dead in captivity, according to The Wall Street Journal. A previous short-term truce deal between Hamas and Israel allowed for the release of over 100 hostages, but it [ended](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/01/israel-hamas-war-reignites-truce-extension/) after Hamas broke the terms of the deal. Getting the remaining hostages out is “going to be a long process,” President Joe Biden said on Dec. 5, according to the WSJ. The U.S. has been [working](https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/28/cia-director-lands-qatar-secret-talks-israeli-intelligence-over-additional-hostage-releases/) with Israel and Qatar to try and strike another temporary truce agreement with Hamas to allow for the release of the remaining hostages.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere. Advertisement - story continues below Democrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border. Their standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life. None of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.

    "text": "La Montagna Pistoiese si prepara ad un fine settimana col suo vestito più bello: quello bianco di neve, caduta nei giorni scorsi su tutto l’Appennino sopra i 1100 metri. Il successivo abbassamento delle temperature, rimaste sottozero anche di giorno sopra i 1300 metri, ha permesso ai cannoni sparaneve di andare ad aggiungere centimetri di manto bianco a quelli già fatti scendere da Madre Natura.\nRisultato: la stragrande maggioranza degli impianti di risalita è aperta nel bel mezzo ad un paesaggio da fiaba, completamente ammantato di neve. A rendere il fine settimana praticamente perfetto per gli appassionati di sci ci penserà anche il meteo: oggi e domani saranno due giornate ricche di sole e pochissime nuvole, con aria frizzantina ma senza temperature gelide.\nDomenica, invece, qualche nuvola arriverà a coprire il cielo, ma senza precipitazioni di sorta. Uno scenario ideale per sciare e godersi la montagna, nel primo “vero” fine settimana invernale dell’anno dopo una lunga serie di giornate di caldo fuori stagione (e senza neve naturale).\nAd Abetone gli operatori turistici e gli impiantisti sono pronti ad accogliere “l’onda bianca” dei turisti: del resto, è ormai da settimane che tutti gli addetti ai lavori attendendevano questo momento.\n“Per questo fine settimana – commenta Rolando Galli, presidente Società Abetone Funivie – avremo aperte l’ovovia, il Pulicchio e i campi scuola di Abetone. Tutto aperto anche in Val di Luce, Selletta e Passo Annibile. Solo per trasferimenti, infine, avremo aperti anche i collegamenti seggiovia Val di Luce – Gomito e Chierroni”.\nTutti pronti per il fine settimana anche alla Doganaccia. Il comprensorio è aperto con le piste del campo scuola, la Uno, la Due, la Tre e la Quattro, con orari di funzione degli impianti di risalita dalle 8.30 alle 16.15.\nInoltre, per favorire l’accesso agli sciatori, da questo fine settimana sarà possibile utilizzare il gratuitamente il servizio navetta bus tra Piazza Sant’Antonio a Cutigliano con la stazione della funivia. Il servizio sarà attivo dalle 10 di mattina ogni quarto d’ora, e rimarrà attivo per il resto della stagione invernale nelle giornate di sabato e domenica.\nLa funivia, invece, sarà attiva tutti i giorni dalle 8.15 alle 12.50 e dalle 14 alle 17.\nNon solo sci alla Doganaccia: per tutti, infatti, c’è la possibilità di partecipare ad escursioni con le ciaspole nei boschi dell’Appennino, con guida e senza. Inoltre sarà possibile partecipare (con un gruppo di 15 persone) ad un elettrizzante uscita con il gatto delle nevi per raggiungere il passo della Croce Arcana, a 1669 metri di altitudine. Per informazioni e prenotazioni di queste due attività è possibile contattare il Rifugio Bicocca al numero 0573 629391 o al mobile 333 5392487. Buon divertimento a tutti!\nFrancesco Storai",
