    "text": "EAST ST LOUIS, Ill. (WAND) - When you visit a state park in the future, you can charge your electric vehicle while you camp or stop for an afternoon hike. Governor Pritzker joined the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and local leadership to announce a donation of multiple electronic vehicle chargers from the electric mobility company EVBox to the state. The company’s 40 Level 2 electric vehicle (EV) chargers will allow visitors to Illinois state parks to conveniently charge their electric vehicles. The chargers will be available at Illinois state parks, historic sites, museums, beaches, and other widely used public areas. “I am proud to announce that the Illinois Department of Natural Resources has installed the first set of electric vehicle charging stations at four Illinois state parks with the help of our partners at EVBox,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “This is a milestone that brings us closer to reaching our ambitious goals of encouraging a reduction in fossil fuel emissions, advancing further electric vehicle adoption by making charging more convenient, and making it easier for people to explore all that our incredible state parks have to offer.” Three of the chargers have been installed in state parks that are within 60 miles driving distance of St. Louis: Frank Holten State Park in East St. Louis, Eldon Hazlet State Recreation Area near Carlyle, and Washington County State Recreation Area near Nashville. A fourth charger was installed at Jim Edgar Panther Creek State Fish and Wildlife Area in Cass County in central Illinois. \"We know the future is electric and we're committed to making sustainable transportation more accessible, not just for Illinois residents, but visitors too,\" said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. \"By bringing EV chargers to these sites, we are supporting our clean energy goals so more and more people can enjoy Illinois!\" These are the first EV chargers made available for public use by the State of Illinois. The state will not charge a fee for drivers to use the chargers. Additional EVBox chargers will be installed at IDNR sites around Illinois, including Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County, Giant City State Park in Jackson County, Shabbona Lake State Recreation Area in Dekalb County, William Powers State Recreation Area in Cook County, and more. To help advance electric mobility in their home state, EVBox, based in Libertyville, teamed up with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Together, they worked on a plan designed to significantly boost the availability of charging stations statewide. “It’s an honor to be part of the effort to electrify Illinois’ beautiful state parks and support Governor Pritzker’s ambitious vision for a greener, more sustainable future. On behalf of EVBox, we’re thrilled to mark the first of several donations of EV chargers to be installed across the state parks” said Dan Fedor, EVBox’s North American Senior Business Development Manager. “Together, we’re making EV charging more accessible and helping to preserve the environment for generations to come.” Copyright 2024.

    "text": "DECATUR, Ala. (WHNT) — A Decatur historical marker commemorating African American Heritage has been replaced after it was damaged last month.\nThe African American Heritage marker in Old Town Decatur has been replaced after it was damaged on March 24.\nThe marker chronicles the forgotten contributions of African Americans to the City of Decatur, going back to before the city was incorporated.\nEstablished in 1821, Old Town was the home of many prominent African Americans and black-owned businesses before Urban Renewal took over in the 1970s. Decatur was incorporated in 1826.\nA spokesperson for the Decatur Preservation originally said it would take a year to get a new marker and the replacement would likely cost thousands.\nHistorian Peggy Towns, who helped get the original marker placed, thanked Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling for helping get the marker quickly replaced.\nThe mayor told News 19’s Archie Snowden that he simply knew the right person to call for help.\n“Nothing beats having reliable friends,” Bowling said. “When I learned about this unfortunate incident, I knew which friend to call.”\nDecatur Police said last month they were investigating what caused the damage to the marker but had not determined if it had been damaged intentionally or accidentally.\nAuthorities said on Tuesday that there were no updates in that investigation.\nThe post Deactur historical marker replaced after damage appeared first on WHNT .",

    "text": "12/5/2024\nWith a background rooted in Illinois, where she completed her BS [BSME 2020], MS [MSME 2022], and PhD [PhD 2024], in mechanical engineering, Teaching Assistant Professor\n[Kellie Halloran](/people/profile/kellie2) brings a deep institutional understanding and an innovative perspective to the MechSE curriculum.\nHer path began as an Illinois undergraduate, and although she didn’t plan on staying for graduate studies her trajectory changed after she joined Associate Professor\n[Mariana Kersh’s](/people/profile/mkersh) research lab, immersing in health and bio-related research in her junior year. “Mariana was very patient with me as I learned about research and how to conduct it well, and I hope to treat my students with the same patience and encouragement,” she said. The experience inspired Halloran to continue into graduate school and eventually become a MechSE faculty member, committed to providing students with the same supportive environment.\nHalloran’s graduate research in bioengineering shaped her teaching philosophy, emphasizing critical thinking and problem-solving. Her research background allows her to connect theoretical content to real-world applications in the classroom, especially in courses like ME 170 (Computer-Aided Design), TAM 210/211 (Statics), and ENG 177 (Engineering First-Year Experience Seminar: Leadership). Teaching these courses holds meaning for Halloran—having taken ME 170 and TAM 210/211 herself, she has first-hand insight into their challenges.\nIn ME 170, she helps students navigate their first design project, guiding them step-by-step through the design process to build confidence. In TAM 210/211, she connects physics, math, and engineering principles to real-world applications, making abstract concepts more accessible and reinforcing students’ confidence in applying theory to practice. Her approach in ENG 177, which she taught as a graduate student, emphasized that while technical skills are essential, leadership and communication are equally critical in engineering. In this course, Halloran guided students in developing their unique leadership strengths, team-building skills, and collaborative approaches.\nChoosing a teaching-focused path instead of a traditional tenure-track role was a pivotal decision for Halloran, enabling her to prioritize hands-on, student-centered learning. She reflected that this choice allowed her to fully focus on helping students develop their understanding without the demands of research commitments. Her teaching philosophy centers on fostering creativity and problem-solving, recognizing that today’s complex challenges require innovative thinking.\n“As problems become more complex, more creative solutions are needed,” she explained, emphasizing that cultivating creativity in engineering students is just as essential as building technical skills.\nOne of Halloran’s goals is to incorporate more creativity-driven and design-based activities into MechSE courses. By working on real-world problems, she believes that students learn to address issues holistically, combining technical knowledge with creative thinking. To support this, she encourages students to explore, hypothesize, and iterate as they work through projects. Halloran continually refines her teaching approach, exploring methods to bridge theory and application, and is committed to keeping MechSE courses engaging and curiosity driven.\nLooking to the future, Halloran is excited about innovating within the MechSE curriculum. “I’m always looking for ways to make learning more interactive and engaging,” Halloran said. “Bringing in new technologies and active learning techniques allows students to connect with the material in meaningful ways, which is key to developing curiosity and critical thinking.” She aims to further integrate interactive, active learning techniques that make education more collaborative and engaging. Long-term, she hopes to contribute to course development and curriculum improvements, particularly by introducing interdisciplinary projects that blend engineering with design. Through these initiatives, Halloran supports MechSE’s mission to prepare students as adaptable, forward-thinking problem-solvers.\nShe understands that engineering can be challenging, especially for students new to the field, and encourages those struggling to reach out. “It’s okay to ask for help!” she advised. Reflecting on her own experience, Halloran recalled that attending office hours and asking questions helped her as a student.\nHer career thus far offers valuable insights to aspiring educators, showing that a teaching-focused role can be deeply fulfilling. Her journey underscores how teaching-centered faculty play a critical role in shaping students’ technical skills, confidence, and personal growth, leaving a lasting impact on future engineers.",

    "text": "At least 5 cases of Whooping Cough in Ector County\nODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - Ector County is seeing a rise in Pertussis cases, or Whooping Cough.\nFirst Alert 7 reached out to the City of Midland, a spokesperson told First Alert 7 that there has not yet been any reports of the cough this year.\nSince the month of November, the Ector County Health Department reports there has been five confirmed Pertussis cases. Odessa High School reported two of those confirmed cases.\nAccording to the Texas Department of State Health Services, there has been triple the number of Pertussis cases in 2024 compared to 2023.\nInfected people are most contagious up to 21 days after the cough begins.\nNazareth Castro, an epidemiologist with the Ector County Health Department said it, “Easily spread through coughing sneezing, especially during the time of the running nose that is where you see the most contagious part of the disease.”\nSymptoms include low fever, runny nose, mild cough and apnea that can last for one to two weeks. As the disease progresses more sever symptoms can develop including paroxysms, vomiting and exhaustion.\nDirector of the Ector County Health Department, Brandy Garcia, said, “It will start developing a pretty significant cough and that cough will have a whooping cough sound and that’s where the whooping sound and that is where the whooping cough comes from.”\nA concern for the health department is the holiday season. With five confirmed cases already, the disease could spread. Garcia said, “When people congregate together and do more gatherings of course all illnesses are easy to spread during those times so we see a lot more during the holiday season because that is when people come together.”\nThere is a vaccine for Pertussis. The D-TAP vaccination can be administered to infants, young children, teens, pregnant women and adults.\n“The D-TAP is the vaccine that is recommended for that and you start that off at two months old so you get 2, 4, 6, and 12 months and 4 to 6 years. Throughout your life, you can still get vaccinated for pertussis so that will be T-DAP is what you get when your teenagers and adolescents,” Garcia said. “We do recommend throughout your life you do get vaccinated for this illness.”\nIf you do test positive for Pertussis you can visit your physician for treatment. You can schedule an appointment for a vaccine with the[ Ector County Health Department](https://www.co.ector.tx.us/page/ector.healthimmunizations).\nCopyright 2024 KOSA. All rights reserved.",
