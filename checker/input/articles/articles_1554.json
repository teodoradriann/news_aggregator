    "text": "Brandon Weatherz: Easing nicely into 2024\nThe weather is taking it easy on us as we turn the corner into a new year. Our Monday starts off with mostly cloudy skies and temps in teens to low 20s. Early clouds give way to sunshine today and a breezy southwest wind sends milder air our way with highs topping off in upper 20s and low 30s. Temperatures remain above average tonight with lows mostly in the 20s. Clouds gradually increase overnight with grayer conditions settling in on Tuesday. Highs manage upper 20s to low 30s once more, then a passing cold front brings a breezy northwest wind and introduces cooler air that hangs around the rest of the week. Even so, temps will consistently be near to a touch above average.\nOur Monday stays dry. We look along the international border for light snow late Monday night into Tuesday morning with little to no accumulation expected. Tuesday evening and overnight brings another round of scattered light snow showers moving in from Canada staying mostly north of Duluth. Accumulation in these northern areas remains minimal, under an inch. We look to the South Shore Tuesday night and Wednesday for lake effect snow. Widespread accumulation here is also under an inch, with a localized 1-3″ found in northern Iron County and Gogebic County. This minimal round of snow is all we have until a stretch of low snow chances arrive Friday night and continue each day through the weekend.\nToday: Mostly cloudy in the morning, then becoming mostly sunny in the afternoon. Breezy. High 31. SW wind 10-15 mph.\nTonight: Mostly clear to start with increasing clouds late. Breezy. Low 23. WSW wind 10-15 mph.\nTomorrow: Cloudy and breezy. High 31. WNW wind 10-15 mph.\nTomorrow night: Cloudy with a slight chance for snow. Low 18. WNW wind 5-15 mph.\nWednesday: Mostly sunny and breezy. High 24. NNW wind 10-15 mph.\nThursday: Partly cloudy.

    "title": "Amina Stevens Talks OWNership Tips She’s Sharing On ‘First-Time Buyer’s Club’ [Exclusive]",
    "text": "On Saturday, [OWN](https://bossip.com/2571408/own-spotlight-the-color-purple-oprah-taraji-p-henson-fantasia-barrino-danielle-brooks/) will premiere a new series spotlighting peoples’ journeys to first-time homeownership and the show’s star gave BOSSIP all the deets. Amina Stevens is showcasing her real estate expertise on First-Time Buyers Club, an unscripted series that offers an in-depth look at the exciting but complex journey of becoming a homeowner for the very first time, no matter the stage in life. The Tampa-based realtor believes that everyone deserves a place to call their very own and her ultimate mission and passion with her work is the building of wealth and the reduction of housing disparity in the Black community. In an exclusive clip from Saturday’s premiere, we see Amina working toward that while helping her client Loretta find a home. Loretta is a grandmother of four looking to finally buy her first home as she approaches retirement. Amina helps to increase Loretta’s purchasing power and expand the scope of her hunt in order to find her the perfect home where she can finally enjoy the much-deserved retirement she has worked decades toward. Loretta has been pre-approved for $265,000 and she’s interested in purchasing a brand-new ranch home. The gracious grandma just doesn’t want the home to be for herself, she wants space for her family including bedrooms for her daughter and her grandkids. “They don’t have their room, they were all sleeping in the room with their mom, five of ’em in one room,” says Loretta. “They’re gonna be excited to know that this is their room.” Amina Stevens Details First Time Buyer’s Club To BOSSIP According to Amina, Loretta’s story is just one of many inspiring moments on the show. “I grew up in apartments and I never really thought that I could buy a home, I want people to have that realization [that they can],” she told BOSSIP’s Managing Editor [Dani Canada.]“I grew up watching home shows all day long and I never thought that would be me.” “Not only will people see that this could be them, but they can actually learn how to do it. They’ll be like, ‘On Loretta’s episode, she used this type of loan, so I need to find this thing, I need to find this program.'” She continued, “It’s no longer just about the home, it’s about the journey. Everybody can find a way to identify with a person, a place, a home, or something in the show. You’re gonna learn, you’re gonna be entertained and you’re gonna be inspired. Elsewhere in the interview, Amina also shut down the notion that people should wait until they’re married to purchase their first home, something some people continue to aspire to. Instead, she believes that someone entering a lifelong partnership with a home is actually a good thing. “I definitely don’t agree with that notion that you should wait to buy until you’re married,” said Amina. “The reality of the situation is that you can buy and buy again with your spouse and you can take your first property into a rental property or you can take the equity out and build your dream home with your spouse. “I think the motto for 2023, 2024, and beyond, is to think bigger and realize when you come to the table with a home, it’s an asset, not a liability.” Watch Amina talk First-Time Buyer’s Club with BOSSIP above. First-Time Buyer’s Club makes its two-episode premiere on the network on Dec. 30 at 9/8c and 9:30/8:30c, right after the season finale of Love and Marriage: Huntsville. - Bad & Boujee: Our Hollywood Faves Dripped Decadently For The Academy Museum Gala - Balenci Bardi: Cardi B Makes Her Debut On The Catwalk For Balenciaga Fall '24 Show - Destiny's Child Reunites & Celebs 'Alien Superstar' Slay At Beyoncé's 'Renaissance' Film World Premiere - So Stunning: Keke Palmer, Janelle Monáe, Tamar Braxton, Coco Jones, & More Attend 2023 BET Soul Train Awards - Fashion Icon Honoree Serena Williams Takes Center Stage At The 2023 CFDA Awards - 'Fashion Killa' Writer Sowmya Krishnamurthy Talks Lil Kim's Style Influence And The KanYe Interview That Did Not Happen - Who Wins The Jollof Wars? #SavorTheCulture Gets A Taste Of Senegal's OG Recipe From Brooklyn's Café Rue Dix - Front Row It Girls Teyana Taylor, Karrueche And Coco Jones Support Phillip Lim's Return To The Runway Comments Bossip Comment Policy Please read our [Comment Policy](https://ionedigital.com/privacy/) before commenting.",

    "text": "Motor FÓRMULA 1 Hamilton quiere \"empezar un nuevo capítulo\" con Ferrari en 2025 Con Mercedes, el piloto que cuenta con 103 victorias en Grandes Premios (un récord) llevó a un nuevo nivel los límites de la Fórmula 1. El siete veces campeón del mundo de Fórmula 1 Lewis Hamilton mostró este viernes en Baréin su deseo de \"empezar un nuevo capítulo\" en su carrera al unirse a la escudería Ferrari en 2025, tras 12 temporadas en Mercedes. El británico de 39 años, que habló ante la prensa por primera vez desde el anuncio a principios de febrero de su salida de Mercedes rumbo a Ferrari, se refirió a los entresijos de su sorprendente decisión. Una sorpresa, pues el británico había renovado el verano boreal su contrato con Mercedes hasta el final de la temporada 2025, pero disponía de una cláusula de libertad que activará al final de la temporada 2024. \"Cuando firmamos en verano (la renovación), estaba claro que veía mi futuro en Mercedes, pero se presentó una oportunidad a principios de año que decidí aprovechar\", explicó durante la última jornada de entrenamientos libres de pretemporada en Baréin. \"Tengo la impresión de que es la decisión más difícil que he tenido que tomar, hace 26 años que estoy vinculado a Mercedes. Me han apoyado y hemos vivido juntos una aventura increíble, que ha marcado la historia del deporte y de la cual me siento muy orgulloso\", añadió. \"Pero al fin y al cabo soy yo quien escribe mi historia y sentí que era el momento de empezar un nuevo capítulo\", reconoció Hamilton. Con Mercedes, el piloto que cuenta con 103 victorias en Grandes Premios (un récord) llevó a un nuevo nivel los límites de la Fórmula 1, ganando seis títulos mundiales de 2014 a 2020. Pero los aficionados de 'Sir Lewis' pueden estar tranquilos, pues el episodio con Mercedes \"todavía no ha terminado\". \"Sigo concentrado al 100% para dar resultados a este equipo este año y terminar bien\", concluyó. El Mundial de Fórmula 1, que contará este año con un récord de hasta 24 Grandes Premios, arranca el 2 de marzo en Baréin.",
