People take a rest at a monastery-turned-temporary shelter for internally displaced people (IDP) in Lashio, Shan state on November 15, 2023. – Fighting has raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state for more than two weeks after an alliance of ethnic minority groups launched a surprise offensive against the military. (Photo by STRINGER / AFP)\nChina’s embassy in Myanmar on Thursday asked its citizens to leave a northern district along the countries’ shared border, citing heightened security risks as ethnic minority armed groups battle the junta.\nFighting has raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state since October, when the so-called “Three Brotherhood Alliance” of ethnic minority groups launched an offensive against the military.\nThe alliance has seized several towns and border hubs vital for trade with China in what analysts say is the biggest military challenge to the junta since it seized power in 2021.\nThe Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), one member of the brotherhood alliance, has vowed to recapture Laukkai town, located in a district bordering China that is run by a military-aligned militia and notorious for gambling, prostitution and online scams.\n“The conflicts in Laukkai district of Kokang, northern Myanmar continue, and safety risks have escalated for people stranded there,” the embassy said on WeChat.\nRead more Chinese chess rocked by cheating rumours, bad behaviour scandal ALSO READ: Trafficking victims in Myanmar forced to sell organs: charity\n“The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar once again reminds Chinese citizens in Laukkai district to evacuate as soon as possible.”\nMedia affiliated with the MNDAA said this week that Myanmar’s junta had carried out airstrikes in the self-administered Kokang region that surrounds Laukkai and shelled parts of the town.\nAFP has contacted an MNDAA spokesperson for comment.\nEarlier this month, Beijing said it had mediated talks between the military and the allied ethnic armed groups and reached an agreement for a “temporary ceasefire”.\nBut clashes have continued in parts of Shan state, with another member of the alliance, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, claiming to have captured two more towns in recent days.\nALSO READ: More than 500 Rohingya refugees land in Indonesia\nChina’s foreign ministry on Thursday described the situation in Kokang as “grim and complicated”.\n“China has always believed that maintaining momentum for a ceasefire and peace talks is in the interests of all relevant parties in Myanmar,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\nAnalysts say Beijing maintains ties with ethnic armed groups in northern Myanmar, some of whom share close ethnic and cultural links with China and use Chinese currency and phone networks in the territory they control.\nBeijing is also a major arms supplier and ally of the junta, but relations have been strained in recent months over the junta’s failure to crack down on online scam compounds in Myanmar that Beijing says target Chinese citizens.\nProtesters gathered for a rare demonstration in Yangon last month to accuse China of backing the ethnic minority alliance, in what analysts say was a move sanctioned by junta authorities.\nALSO READ: UN says more than 200,000 people displaced in recent Myanmar fighting\n– By: © Agence France-Presse\nRead more on these topics China myanmar Catch up with the latest news from The Citizen on WhatsApp by following our channel.

    "title": "Ben Jealous: When demagogues blame the vulnerable, we all lose | New Pittsburgh Courier",
    "text": "In hard times, people look for answers. The decimation of American manufacturing starting in the 1990s with trade agreements like NAFTA led to decades of downward economic mobility for working families. That creates ripe conditions for demagogues to come out of the woodwork offering an easy answer for people’s pain. And if history teaches us anything, that answer is usually someone else to blame.\nToday’s anti-immigrant movement follows the same dangerous pattern: stoke fear, tell lies, and divide working people against each other. We should recognize the humanity of people fleeing poverty, violence, or climate chaos, who come here with little more than the hope they will find opportunity and be treated with dignity. Instead we get bombarded with claims that immigrants are taking jobs, draining welfare programs, and driving up crime.\nLet’s be clear—the data says otherwise.\nImmigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens, according to studies from the Cato Institute and the American Immigration Council. They contribute more in taxes than they receive in public benefits. And far from taking jobs, immigrant labor fills critical shortages in healthcare, construction, farming, and more—keeping our economy going while supporting their families and ours.\nThe myths persist because the truth is harder to confront. Our economy has failed too many people for too long. Factory towns across the Midwest and elsewhere are hollowed out. Wages have stagnated. Housing costs have skyrocketed. College debt weighs down the next generation before they can even begin. When real solutions feel out of reach, fear finds a foothold.\nBut the solution is not scapegoating. The solution is building.\nRight now, the green economy is our best shot at economic revival. Spurred on by legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are opening new factories for wind turbines, electric school buses, and solar panels. We are building a power grid for the next century. We are creating careers—not just jobs—that pay well, reduce pollution, and lower energy bills.\nThis transition is already underway. But the budget reconciliation bill just passed by the US House and heading to the Senate attempts to bring it to a grinding halt. Instead of investing in the jobs that will power the global economy, the bill guts clean energy funding. It slashes Medicaid and food assistance for working families to pay for billions in tax cuts for the top 1 percent.\nThe bill does not solve a single problem. It makes every one of them worse.\nWhat is in that disaster of a bill has been well reported: Attacks on Americans who get their health care through Affordable Care Act exchanges … deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance … all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and Trump’s immigrant deportation (and detention) agenda.\nThe House-passed bill would also repeal most IRA clean energy tax credits and investments and undermine public health by inviting a flood of air and water pollution. The repeal of the clean energy tax credits alone would reportedly increase US household energy costs by $16 billion by 2030, and cost more than 830,000 jobs and $1 trillion in GDP over the next eight years.\nThe cruelty of it is the point. The pain inflicted on everyday Americans is across the board. It tells struggling Americans: You will not get affordable healthcare. You will not get relief from rising rent or energy prices. But we will show you someone to blame – and punish them in public.\nScapegoating is about power. It’s about exploiting people’s anxieties and frustrations to gain that power. And it’s about making an example of a group to chill dissent and create a climate of fear. We’re already seeing how this administration is trying to retaliate against those who are calling out and standing up to its dehumanizing immigration sweeps. That is also part of the playbook.\nMeanwhile, the real drivers of hardship go unaddressed.\nClimate change, for example, is already uprooting communities around the world. In El Salvador, climate-fueled droughts forced rural families into overcrowded cities where gangs preyed on their desperation. Many fled north to escape the violence. Some walked thousands of miles. Along the way, they risked kidnapping, assault, rape, and death. Many did not survive the journey.\nImagine how bad things must be to make that trip with your children in tow.\nIt is also worth remembering that some of the people we just honored on Memorial Day were immigrants. Foreign-born Americans have always served and sacrificed for this country —from the Civil War to Afghanistan. It is but one example that shows creating paths to citizenship and legal status is not giving people a handout. It is giving them a chance to fully belong to the nation—a nation many of them have already helped defend.\nWe can choose to turn away from politics that prey on fear. And turn toward a future built on shared prosperity, shared responsibility, and shared humanity. That’s an America worth fighting for.\n(Ben Jealous is the Executive Director of the Sierra Club and a Professor of Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.)",

    "text": "Cette experte locale recommande de visiter cette \"petite ville charmante\" - une pépite méconnue d'Italie Envie d'un peu de soleil cet automne ? Pour les vacances de la Toussaint, on vous conseille de prendre la direction de l'Italie. Mais oubliez Rome, Venise ou Naples... Cette locale vous conseille LA ville à voir sans trop de touristes. On le sait, l'Italie regorge de trésors : que ce soit le Colisée à Rome, le Ponte Vecchio à Florence ou encore la Place Saint-Marc à Venise... On y vit la dolce vita au rythme des Spritz bus en terrasse et des pizzas dévorées au dîner. Notre voisin de l'autre côté des Alpes a ainsi accueilli l'an dernier pas moins de 57 millions de touristes étrangers selon les données de ONU Tourisme. Alors dur dur d'y trouver un coin où s'y poser en vacances sans trop de monde. Sauf si... Sauf si vous sortez des sentiers battus et que vous faites confiance à Laura Itzkowitz, une journaliste basée à Rome qui travaille depuis une dizaine d'années pour le site spécialisé dans les voyages, [Travel and Leisure](https://www.travelandleisure.com/) ! Elle a partagé aux lecteurs son top 11 des villes à voir absolument en Italie et, surprise, au milieu de celles très attendues comme par exemple Milan ou Turin, elle y a aussi glissé quelques pépites encore méconnues et donc garanties sans surtourisme ! C'est ainsi que cette experte locale de la culture italienne recommande notamment un passage par la ville de Pérouse (Perugia en italie), capitale de seulement 161 000 habitants de la région Ombrie. Pour elle, c'est un véritable joyau caché aux yeux des touristes. Elle en parle comme d'une \"petite ville charmante qui ressemble aujourd'hui à ce qu'elle était au Moyen Âge, ce qui en fait un lieu idéal pour s'immerger dans l'histoire.\" Pour ceux qui veulent découvrir l'Italie authentique, c'est donc ici qu'il faut se rendre pour les vacances ou un petit city trip de quelques jours. A noter que Pérouse est notamment accessible facilement en car ou voiture, en 1h20 de route, depuis sa grande voisine, Sienne. Et on y voit quoi à Pérouse ? On y visite notamment le Palazzo dei Priori pour admirer les fresques du peintre Le Pérugin - l'un des maîtres de Raphaël - ou la Cathédrale San Lorenzo, on s'y promène avec une gelato à la main le long des remparts étrusques et on fait une halte à la Torre degli Sciri, une tour qui domine la ville avec ses 42 mètres de haut. Laura recommande aussi d'y déguster du chocolat, une spécialité de la ville, en faisant un passage par la boutique artisanale Augusta Perusia.",

    "text": "The National Model Animal Science Center was unveiled on Wednesday in Zhuozhou City, north China's Hebei Province, focusing on technologies and advancements in future agriculture, biotechnology, food, and health. The center has a particular focus on animal models, or non-human species used in biomedical research, which play a significant role in disease simulation, drug screening, and genetic research. Pigs, due to their similarities to humans in genetic, metabolic, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, are major subjects for studying human diseases and xenotransplantation. Primarily organized by China Agricultural University, the science center features cutting-edge equipment and technologies designed to modify genes precisely and create pig models that simulate complex human diseases, advancing the development of new drugs. \"We can utilize all the large-scale equipment to examine pigs comprehensively. For instance, we can create models simulating diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular conditions, which aid in texture analysis and drug research and development,\" said Zhao Yaofeng, a professor at the College of Biological Sciences at China Agricultural University.",
