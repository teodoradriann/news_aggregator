    "text": "THE BRONX (WABC) -- A Bronx-based rabba for nearly 15 years has helped open new doors for women who want to pursue a career in rabbinic leadership. Rabba Sara Hurwitz is believed to be the first orthodox woman rabbi publicly ordained in the United States, and her journey led her to co-founding Yeshivat Maharat -- the first institution in the United States to ordain orthodox women as clergy. \"Orthodox women have spent too many years sort of sitting in the background,\" said Hurwitz, who also serves as the president at Maharat. The school, which Hurwitz helped opened in 2009, is about to graduate its largest class yet next month -- an accomplishment she is very proud of. \"I have noticed that there is an uptick in general of women wanting to pursue a career in rabbinic leadership,\" she said. Hurwitz didn't always dream of being a rabbi but was drawn to the leadership after college. She knew she wanted to make a difference in her community. \"My parents took us out of apartheid South Africa in 1989, and by doing so sent my sister and I a really strong, profound message of equality,\" Hurwitz acknowledged. With no precedent for an orthodox female rabbi in the synagogue, Hurwitz mastered Jewish texts and took exams all under the private tutelage of Rabbi Avi Weiss who ordained her. \"In those early years, I received a lot of pushback,\" said Hurwitz. \"That felt very painful.\" But Hurwitz turned that pain into a movement, opening doors for dozens of orthodox Jewish women, including Yeshivat Maharat graduate Rabbi Erin Smokler. \"I come from, I suppose a line of rabbis, both my grandfathers were pulpit rabbis,\" Smokler said. \"And so it was something that was in my blood, but not something that was on my horizon.\" Hurwitz says next year she expects to have 100 ordained women in the world since opening the school.",

    "text": "Bridgerton season 4 is truly a lesson in good things come to those who wait. Following the end of season 3 (AKA after waiting for months), we were over the moon to find out Luke Thompson's Benedict would lead the senior season, even if we originally thought Luke Newton spoiled it would actually be about Eloise . And after literal years of waiting to see who would play Ben's love interest Sophie, including a major theory Cressida had actually been Sophie the whole time , we were introduced to Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek .\nThe Halo actress told Tudum how much she's enjoyed joining the Bridgerton cast family, and how much she's enjoyed her dance lessons so far . It looks like the dance lessons are paying off because we just got the first leak from the Bridgerton season 4 set and it's proof that Yerin and Luke are the perfect match.\nCheck Out The First 'Bridgerton' Season 4 Leak!\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Bridgerton (@thebridgertonfamily)\nThe first thing I thought of when I saw these Bridgerton season 4 leaks was just how perfect the height difference between Luke Thompson and Yerin Ha is. I can't wait to see them dance!!!\nPlus, I just cannot get over Sophie's dress. We know from the books that her masquerade ball persona becomes The Lady In Silver, and the bows and beaded detail are a gorgeous addition to an outfit book fans have been waiting so long for. While less feminine or over-the-top, I'm also digging Ben's vest and trousers. Last year we got pirate Colin, maybe now we get pirate Benedict?\nWe knew that Bridgerton season 4 would capture the magic of Cinderella , but these leaks prove the Netflix series is dedicated to shaking things up. Instead of Sophie running away and making her way down the stairs solo, she's actually joined by Benedict for an outdoor dance, which is totally giving A Cinderella Story . Private moments are few and far between in the Ton, so here's hoping Benedict and Sophie get to steal quite a few.\nRead up on This Bridgerton Season 4 Detail Is The Perfect Catalyst For Eloise's Love Story for more!\nFrom Your Site Articles Attention, Anthony Lovers!

Среди них – 74-летняя Светлана, которая в отчаянии оформила российский паспорт и решила ездить в Россию за пенсией лично. Помогло ли это? Пока нет. Поскольку Светлана (имя изменено по просьбе героини – прим. RusDelfi ) родилась и некоторое время работала в Ленинградской области, ей по закону положена российская пенсия. Деньги на счет в эстонском банке должны поступать ей раз в квартал – сразу в евро, по текущему курсу. Обычно это около 300 евро. Очередной перевод Светлана ждала в декабре, но выплаты так и не пришли.",
