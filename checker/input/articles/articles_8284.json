    "title": "Tennessee senator London Lamar makes case for new parents in politics",
    "text": "In the Tennessee General Assembly, lawmakers will often gather papers, perhaps a briefcase and a coffee, before ambling up to the Senate or House chamber ahead of a floor session. In the Senate Minority Caucus chair’s office, Sen. London Lamar gathers bags. Multiple bags. Bags stuffed to the gills with the accouterments of infancy and motherhood — a pacifier, gripe water, a change of clothes, extra wipes and diapers. A gray backpack to sling over her shoulder. A bag or two stuffed into the undercarriage of a stroller. She juggles the bags like she juggles the roles in her life as a state senator, Democratic caucus chair, regional director at a national education nonprofit and now mother to Nylinn, her 7-month-old son. Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide Lamar, D-Memphis, is the first lawmaker to give birth while actively serving in the Tennessee Senate, and the first state lawmaker in decades to give birth while in office. At 33, she is the youngest lawmaker in the upper chamber and, even as cultural and political norms shift, a rarity in American politics where women overall are underrepresented in elected office, with mothers of young children even further marginalized. “I love it, but it’s really, really hard,” Lamar said. “People get to see me go through this process and struggle in real time, and a lot of women have gone through these struggles behind closed doors at home.” “I’m in the public eye, doing this work and showing up here four days a week with my son,” she said. A single mother, Lamar has balanced her first full legislative session since giving birth with family help, but Nylinn also makes frequent trips to the Capitol often with his mother, earning the affectionate nickname of “Baby Senator” from fellow lawmakers and staff. Lamar has cradled Nylinn in her arms while passing bills out of committee, and he frequently naps in his stroller behind her desk on the Senate floor. Though record numbers of American women have been elected to office in recent political cycles, female representation in Tennessee remains among the lowest in the nation and has actually decreased from record highs in the early aughts. Women now make up just over 15% of the General Assembly , less than half the national average and 49th in the country, ranked ahead of only West Virginia. In the Senate, there are eight women — five Democrats and three Republicans. It’s an underrepresentation that stands in stark contrast to Tennessee political participation, as Tennessee women consistently register to vote and cast ballots at higher rates than men . Meanwhile, Tennessee mothers have spearheaded and reshaped legislative advocacy in the state in recent years. Yet, female lawmakers raising young children remain an anomaly in the General Assembly. The representation is vital, lawmakers and political experts say, to both increase the pipeline of women in politics and bring topics to the fore that have more traditionally been relegated as “women’s issues.” “As women are in these spaces that they have not been in before, as women with younger kids are in these spaces, they’re raising questions just by being there that point to the challenges of serving with young children,” said Jean Sinzdak, associate director for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Lamar has frequently championed child care issues alongside colleague Sen. Charlane Oliver, D-Nashville, who has three children aged 4, 12 and 13. As Oliver notes, the two are in a “triple minority” — young, Black, and women in elected office — within a system that historically has not supported a framework to help women succeed. “I’m using those as superpowers because that’s what makes me unique in this building,” Oliver said. While motherhood has not changed Lamar’s policy priorities, it has sharpened them, bringing a new urgency and fierceness to her support for long-championed causes such as maternal health issues, pre-K expansion and lowering prescription drug costs. “I hope when people see me, it encourages more women like me to run for office because it is possible,” Lamar said. “I’m doing it, right? It isn’t easy, but I’m doing it, and I think that we need more young women with children in office to bring these issues to light.” How does she do it all? The question is, in and of itself, a double standard. Male candidates and legislators are far less likely to be asked how they juggle their legislative position outside career and family life , but things are changing slowly. In the U.S. Congress, a new group emerged last year: the Congressional Dads Caucus, created by Rep. Jimmy Gonzalez of California, seen in the House gallery—and on C-SPAN—with his then 4-month-old son, Hodge, strapped to his chest while waiting to vote for a new House Speaker back in January 2023. The caucus is a group of more than a dozen Democrats, men and women, working to promote paid medical and family leave and expanded child tax credits . While at least ten women have given birth while serving in Congress, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois made history as the first senator to give birth while in office to her second daughter, Maile Pearl Bowlsbey, in 2018. (The senator gave birth to her first daughter, Abigail, in 2014 as a member of the House of Representatives.) Though legislator ages have historically skewed older, often when both men and women have established careers that allow flexibility for part-time legislative work, men have long held public office with young children at home. In fact, a wife and kids at home were the markers of stability and trustworthiness, a campaign asset, said Sinzdak. But, even as the daily tasks of child care and family life have inched toward equity, women are still far and away the primary caregivers in American families, particularly during children’s earliest year s, and the responsibility that conveyed stability for a male politician was regularly interpreted as a weakness for women. “The traditional advice campaign operatives gave to women would be, ‘Don’t highlight your children,’ in case voters wonder why you aren’t home to take care of them,” Sinzdak said. “It was common for male candidates to have campaign flyers with the whole family on it, but women with younger kids might not emphasize that part of their background.” It is a question Lamar wrestles with. On a recent Monday ahead of a Senate floor session, she squeezed in an interview in her office with Nylinn, sporting a black-and-white buffalo check button-down, resting in her lap as he was beset by hiccups. He later curled a fist into her hair, which Lamar gently detangled while speaking about the shift motherhood has taken on her political career. Nylinn is already well-accustomed to legislative meetings, with Lamar joking he was taking political meetings in the womb, but even he has his limit with a reporter’s questions. As he began to get fussy, Lamar began pacing her office to soothe him without missing a beat. “Now, this is what taking a meeting with Senator Lamar looks like,” she said wryly. Like many part-time state lawmakers, Lamar drives to Nashville during the legislative session. During this time, lawmakers often stay in local apartments to attend Capitol meetings between Monday and Thursday. Her mom helps out, but Lamar is loath to leave the baby three hours away in Memphis. Child care prices in Nashville were an ugly shock. Lamar acknowledged the “privilege” of being a state lawmaker with the flexibility to bring him to her office, committee meetings and floor sessions. Everybody “loves a baby,” which is evidenced by the smiles Nylinn elicits from passers-by when his mom walks him through the legislative tunnel connecting the Cordell Hull office building to the Capitol. “As privileged as I am, he’s with me also because I can’t afford day care,” Lamar said, though she’s already doing the numbers crunch for when Nylinn is a mobile toddler and not as easily corralled in meetings. Child care costs remain a large impediment for women running for office, experts say. Vote Mama, a left-leaning foundation studying gender equity and the political participation of mothers in the U.S., has tracked a rise in legislation allowing the use of campaign funds for child care. Thirty states now have similar laws. “This is the first time that anyone has looked at caregiving as a point of identity in terms of legislatures,” said Liuba Grechen Shirley, Vote Mama CEO. Shirley was the first candidate to receive federal approval to spend campaign funds on child care during a 2018 New York congressional campaign. Vote Mama tracked a more than 2,000% increase in state and local usage of campaign funds for child care between 2018 and 2022. “It’s a small structural change, but it completely transforms the landscape,” she said. “Seventy percent of the funds used at state legislatures were used by women of color.” Running for office in 2022 wasn’t on Oliver’s bingo card, but the progressive advocate in Nashville joined a crowded Democratic primary after the longtime incumbent stepped down and she was encouraged to run. She was the only woman in the primary, an “isolating” time for Oliver as she juggled the schedules of her three children and a first-time political campaign, but she felt she needed to step up to provide the best representation for her Nashville district. Now, by the time she arrives at the Capitol every day for an 8:30 a.m. floor session or committee meeting, she’s shuttled the kids to three different schools after her husband, a first responder, leaves for his early morning shift. Child care issues were at the top of Oliver’s priority list for her first session in 2023, when she attempted to pass legislation to codify campaign funds for child care expenses. The bill led to the ethics ruling clarifying Tennessee law, which already allows for it, a major win for Oliver. “We were able to get clarity that that is an allowable expense, being able to raise those funds not only for yourself as the candidate but for your campaign team,” Oliver said. “That’s gonna be a game changer.” At a weekly Democratic news conference in February, Nylinn cooed inside his stroller as his mom decried the recent shooting at a Kansas City Super Bowl celebration parade. As he began to cough, Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, snuck away from the line of Democratic lawmakers to pull him out of his stroller. Lamar soon pivoted to discuss her plan to expand Medicaid to fund gun violence prevention strategies as Nylinn looked on, perched on the knee of a caucus staffer. “I will say, since having him, my work is more meaningful,” Lamar said. “I had issues I knew were important, and I fought hard for those issues. But now I’m fighting because everything I vote on literally impacts him.” Nylinn has reiterated for Lamar the personal is political, though her journey to motherhood has been at the forefront of her policy for years. Lamar has publicly shared details of a previous, near-fatal pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. While pregnant with Nylinn last spring, Lamar pushed for broader exceptions to Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban, concerned expectant mothers would be forced to reach the brink of death before accessing medical care. This year, Lamar is carrying a bill that would create a board to review maternal health data and make state health policy recommendations. The legislation is expected to get a full Senate vote this month. Oliver this year backed a comprehensive child care policy slate, in part driven by concerns raised last fall over an impending funding “cliff” for day cares. “I just personally believe people who are directly impacted by problem are best at addressing the solution. As a working mother who actively is paying for daycare, I feel the sting of that every single week. I understand how it works,” Oliver said. More: Tennessee child care providers brace for funding 'cliff' that could leave parents with even fewer options Oliver has framed child care concerns as a “workforce development” issue, not just a mother’s or family issue. “Every time I’d talk about paid leave or child care, someone would say, ‘Ignore the women’s issues and stick to the bread and butter issues,’” Grechen Shirley said. “It’s the most basic bread and butter issue. It’s an absolute economic issue that people don’t focus on. The more moms who talk about, and the more we talk about the economic implications, the more people start to listen.” With a Republican supermajority in Tennessee, though, Democrats are fighting an uphill battle to often get their legislation heard in committee, let alone make it to a full chamber vote. Oliver’s bill to expand pre-K availability in the state, co-sponsored by Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-Nashville, failed to advance through the Senate Education Committee on March 13. “We miss out on the ability to connect the intersection between giving birth, having the choice, and then having the supports such as child care, paid family leave, living wages, and health care,” when mothers of young children are underrepresented in elected office, Oliver said. “All of those intersect and are issues that don’t get addressed up here. It’s economic justice, it puts people on a path to start their life in a way that’s thriving. We’re not having those conversations up here.” Change is slow in American politics, Sinzdak said, but the U.S. is seeing things shift “generationally” as more mothers with young children run for office. In Middle Tennessee, a handful of first-time political candidates and mothers are currently vying for legislative seats. Most are Democrats, which Sinzdak notes is common, a combination of party platform affiliation and preexisting national efforts on the left to better recruit and fund female candidates. And, Sinzdak notes, “the role model effect is a real thing, and it does have an impact.” “When we see more and more diverse groups of elected officials serving, it changes voter perception of what an elected official looks like,” Sinzdak said. “If she can do it, I can do it, too.”",

    "text": "Rick Warren apologises for suggesting Jesus was a centrist\nPastor Rick Warren has been criticised after apparently suggesting that Jesus Christ was a political centrist.\nOn 11 February, and writing on X, cited John 19:18, which describes the crucifixion of Jesus between two thieves.\n\"If you're looking for the #realJesus, not a caricature disfigured by partisan motivations, you'll find him in the middle, not on either side,\" he said.\nVarious conservative pundits took issue with the post, which was later deleted. Michael Knowles, of the Daily Wire, said, \"The thief to our Lord's right is in heaven, and the thief to his left is in hell. Not the best analogy for the point you wish to make.\"\nOther critics, such as Babylon Bee's Joel Berry and Seth Dillon, noted that the story of the two thieves was focused on the repentance of one of the thieves and was not an analogy for political centrism.\nWarren apologised for his post, writing on 16 February, \"I apologise. I wrote poorly. I don't believe Jesus was a centrist. He stands far above it all ... Jesus demands our total allegiance as the center of our lives.\"\nWarren, 71, has long been a prominent figure in American, and arguably world Christianity. His book, The Purpose Driven Life, released in 2002, has sold well over 50 million copies in over 80 countries, making it one of the most influential Christian books of the 21st century.\nHe founded the California based Saddleback Church in 1980, which boasts weekly attendance of 30,000 people. In 2008 Warren was chosen to give the invocation at President Barack Obama's first inauguration ceremony.\nMarried for nearly 50 years, Warren and his family were hit by tragedy in 2013 when his youngest son Matthew committed suicide following years of difficulty with mental illness. Following his son's death, Warren established a church ministry devoted to helping those within the church struggling with mental illness.",

    "title": "8 Reasons Why I Still Use DALL-E for AI Image Generation",
    "text": "Key Takeaways - DALL-E is very easy to use. - It has better functionality compared to before. - Editing tools are provided in the software. Midjourney. Stable Diffusion. Adobe Firefly. The list goes on. And yet, despite all the options out there, I still use DALL-E to generate AI images. Why? Keep reading to find out why I prefer this AI image generator. 1 DALL-E Is Easy to Use If I’m going to adopt any new technology, it has to be easy to use or learn. One of the biggest reasons why I continue to use DALL-E for AI image generation is because creating images is incredibly straightforward. Once you’ve logged into ChatGPT, all you have to do is enter a prompt for the type of image you want. DALL-E will then get to work and generate an image within a few minutes at most. After receiving your image, you can then decide if you want to make further adjustments. The biggest challenge when you’re generating AI images in DALL-E will be getting your prompts right. Being vague will give you suboptimal results, so for that reason, I recommend checking out [the best DALL-E editing prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/dall-e-3-editing-prompts/). 2 DALL-E Has Improved Significantly Since the Early Days DALL-E is not perfect, and I still encounter problems like illegible text in my images. However, having used the tool since it was initially released, I can say with confidence that it’s much better now than it previously was. When I enter prompts in DALL-E now, it normally gets them right within a few attempts at most. I’ve also noticed fewer defects than what used to appear, and significantly fewer than many other AI image generators. As the software becomes more proficient at analyzing text and can feed off more data, I’m confident that DALL-E will continue improving in the long run. I doubt I’ll ever use it for real-life pictures, though, and I also make it clear that [my mobile photos weren’t made with AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/make-mobile-photos-look-real-not-ai/). 3 Access to ChatGPT at the Same Time I know that this only counts if you also use ChatGPT, but I like using as few apps as possible. If more than one solution is available within the same software, it makes my life much easier because it prevents me from switching back and forth between apps. As a result, I can concentrate better throughout the day. When using DALL-E, I don’t even need to go to a new part of the app to then access ChatGPT. At the very most, I just have to create a new chat and enter my new prompt there. While [I wish that ChatGPT would include several UI improvements](https://www.makeuseof.com/improvements-chatgpt-ui-needs/), it’s also nice that I can access both my DALL-E prompts and ChatGPT conversations in the same sidebar. 4 DALL-E Has Editing Tools When I first started using DALL-E, one of my biggest complaints was that it didn’t have native editing tools. Having to edit the whole image when I just wanted to change one thing was frustrating, and to be honest, I used the app much less as a result. Now, however, DALL-E has this feature. Although [the app’s integrated editing tools still need work](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-dalle-3-editing-tools-work/), they are a good starting point. You can choose a specific area within the image that you want to edit, adjusting the brush size based on the size of the sections you wish to adjust. Since [ChatGPT also has a canvas feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-use-chatgpt-canvas-mode/), I would probably use DALL-E even more if it introduced a similar tool for image editing. 5 You Can Access DALL-E From Everywhere One of my biggest frustrations with some AI image generators is that you can only access them from a browser. However, this is not the case with DALL-E. Granted, I mainly generate AI image on my browser, but I will sometimes use the ChatGPT smartphone app instead. You can also use DALL-E to generate AI images if you have a tablet. With this level of flexibility, you have the option to make faster adjustments on the go. On top of that, you can quickly make something if a new idea comes to mind. 6 DALL-E Is Good at Creating a Variety of Images I’ve used DALL-E for photorealistic images and illustrations, and I have also tried it for portraits, landscapes, and much more. While it’s certainly weak in some areas, I think that DALL-E does a good job of making decent images across the board. If I need something different and have tried multiple prompts, only then will I consider turning to an alternative AI image generator. But most of the time, I haven’t felt the need to do that. You can always try different AI image generators if you're still on the fence. [Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion](https://www.makeuseof.com/midjourney-vs-dalle-vs-stable-diffusion/) are considered the top contenders. 7 You Can Vote Whether You Like a DALL-E Image or Not Many other generative AI tools have this feature as well, but I like how you can quickly give DALL-E feedback. If you like an image, you can leave a thumbs up. And if you’re not happy with the result, marking it with a thumbs down will tell the GPT that it needs to improve for future prompts. I also like that it takes very little time to leave feedback in DALL-E. Once you’ve done this, you can then generate more prompts that will be in line with what you want. You may also want to check this guide on [using DALL-E in ChatGPT 4](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-chatgpt-4-ai-images/) to create better images. 8 I Know How to Use DALL-E to Its Maximum Capabilities While I absolutely agree that some AI image generators are better than others, your knowledge will limit how well you use them. If you’re unsure which prompts work, how the tool responds to different feedback, and what its strengths and weaknesses are, you’ll struggle to get the most optimal results. Having used DALL-E for a long time now, I know how to get the most out of it. I understand which prompts work, and where its weak spots are. Because of this, I can also decide if I need to use another generator for my specific task. Another advantage of knowing how to use DALL-E is that I can incorporate extra tools later if needed. For example, I might need to resize something in Canva because DALL-E struggles in this respect. DALL-E is one of many AI image generators, but despite the competition out there, I still prefer it. It’s easy to use, but more importantly, I know how to get the most out of the software. And with editing tools now in the picture, I’m confident that DALL-E will only continue improving.",

    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards\nBy Ramishah Maruf, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission\n issued several warnings for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death.\nWalmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy.\nEarlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s\nsmall parts cylinder (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”\nThe agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States.\nThe recall affects about 4,240 units.\nThe CPSC said customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
