    "text": "A new travel trend is becoming a concern in the travel space.\nKnown as “burglary tourists,” travelers who specifically visit a destination to break into or steal from their accommodations or local attractions, has come to the attention of authorities.\nNBC News reported that a ring of burglary tourists who had entered the United States with plans to break into homes has recently come to the attention of police\nin Los Angeles, California.\nUnderstanding The Trend\nBurglary tourists are individuals who travel to different cities or countries with the intent of committing theft there.\nThey often target tourist hotspots or wealthy neighborhoods where they believe there will be valuable items to steal. Burglary tourists may use various tactics to gain access to homes or businesses, such as posing as tourists or using distraction techniques.\nAlan Hamilton, the deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, told The L.A. that burglary tourists are not new Los Angeles, but that the groups have become increasingly active in recent months.\n“The number of crimes tied to these kind of crews are way, way up,” Hamilton told the L.A. Times.\nHe noted that the groups often target homes “connected to open spaces” like canyons or hiking trails that provide easier access to the property.\nMany of these tourists are unarmed and are solely seeking items to sell, according to the LAPD, but there is still a threat.\nBurglary tourism can have a significant negative impact on the local community, as it can lead to a a greater interest in property crimes and loss of valuables.\nIt can also be harmful to local tourism by making\na certain area feel unsafe.\nLessening the Risk\nLaw enforcement agencies, like the LAPD, have been working to identify and apprehend burglary tourist groups.\nThe hope is that the arrests will help prevent further crimes and protect security of residents and visitors alike.\nTravelers are advised to take precautions to\nprotect their belongings and property while visiting unfamiliar locations to reduce the risk of incident.\nResidents, on the hand, are advised to utilize security measures, like alarm systems and monitoring equipment, when they are out of town.",

    "title": "Letter: Belittling of opponents",
    "text": "Why do people like Donald Trump and JD Vance always belittle or denigrate their opponents? Most of you probably already realize the signs of such behavior but here is what I found, and I am not even a psychologist. 1. They are trying to make themselves feel more powerful or important. 2 They have low self-esteem and need to build themselves up by making others feel inferior. 3. They are insecure in relationships. 4. It is a form of narcissism in that they need to belittle, degrade, and insult in order to chip away at your self-confidence. I think you get the picture. I also wonder if this if part of Trump's strategy or just his natural personality. I remember Trump always calling Biden a \"loser\", when in fact Trump lost 62 out of 63 court cases where he challenged the results of the 2020 election. He also has 34 felony convictions. Do we really want someone like this in the White House? God help us. Joseph Malberg People are also reading… Marana Disclaimer: As submitted to the Arizona Daily Star.",
