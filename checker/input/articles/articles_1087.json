    "text": "KARACHI: After staging a day-long sit-in outside the KMC headquarters on Friday, hundreds of retired employees and pensioners of different town municipal committees (TMCs) announced that they would expand their protest against non-payment of dues.\nThey said the next demonstration would be held on Tuesday on main M.A. Jinnah Road with a warning that it could last for an ‘indefinite’ period.\nIn a statement, the alliance of different unions of the KMC and bodies of its retired employees said that the mayor of Karachi and the KMC authorities had brought their lives on the verge of collapse which required decisive action.\n“During our sit-in earlier this week, the Karachi mayor, accompanied by officers, left the office without negotiating with the protesters,” said Zulfiqar Shah, senior leader of the alliance.\nLabour unions to stage sit-in, observe hunger strike in front of KMC head office next week\n“So the participants have decided to continue their protest and announced further actions.\nWe will observe a symbolic two-hour strike on Monday, Thursday and Friday and then we will stage a sit-in and observe hunger strike in front of the KMC head office on Tuesday.”\nSince 2017, he said, the KMC and TMC retirees and widows had been facing problems of non-payment of their dues.\nSince October 2023, pension cases of TMC retirees had not been processed by the KMC, leading to severe financial hardship for many, he added.\n“In response, employee unions have formed a joint alliance. Leaders from multiple groups, such as Sajjan Union, United Workers Front, United Workers Union (Kaneez Fatima Group), and others, along with hundreds of retired employees and pensioners are united for this protest. The unions will also approach the courts for legal action.”\nPublished in Dawn, November 30th, 2024",

    "text": "VICTORIA — British Columbia's Opposition leader says community safety should come before protection of privacy rights for dangerous people. The public should know who is living in their community, BC United Leader Kevin Falcon said on Thursday after introducing proposed private-member's legislation to automatically stop people convicted of dangerous offences from legally changing their names. He said he introduced the proposed bill to amend the Name Act after learning child-killer Allan Schoenborn was recently permitted to legally change his name. Schoenborn was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of his children, aged five, eight and 10, whose bodies were found in the family's Merritt, B.C., home in 2008. A judge ruled he was not criminally responsible because of a mental disorder after the verdict. His new identity has not been made public. His name change came to light when he asked the BC Review Board — the body that determines his custody status every year — to restrict publication of his new legal name. The board denied the application, saying it would give Schoenborn until April 30 to seek a legal review of its decision. If no legal action is taken, the board said it will use Schoenborn's current legal and former names in its reasons for disposition. Falcon said the NDP government has the power under the current Name Act to prevent name changes, but it did not do that with Schoenborn, who has been held at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Coquitlam, B.C., since 2010. \"This is a huge problem for the safety of communities,\" he said at a news conference. \"And as I often say around these issues, when government balances competing interests, I put the interests of community safety well above the interest of Allan Schoenborn to have his name changed so that he can move around the community unnoticed.\" Falcon said recently permitting Schoenborn to change his name is \"not acceptable.\" He said he fears a dangerous person could \"show up in your community, perhaps even in a neighbourhood living in a basement suite across the street, without you even being aware because the NDP allowed his last name to be changed without anyone knowing what the new name is.\" The Opposition's Name Amendment Act, if passed, would automatically prevent people designated as a dangerous or long-term offender under the Criminal Code from filing applications to change their name, said Falcon. \"Currently, Vital Statistics, under the Ministry of Health, has complete authority to deny any change of name application that is 'sought for an improper purpose or is on any other ground objectionable,'\" Falcon said in the legislature. \"This government failed to use that to prevent Schoenborn's name change.\" Falcon called on the legislature to pass his private member's bill as soon as possible. Premier David Eby said earlier he would look at the current name-change legislation because people should not be able to evade responsibility for criminal offences by changing their names.

    "text": "TACOMA, Wash. — Ever since an art teacher handed her a glue stick in elementary school,\n Sarah Jane Hoppe has loved cutting up paper and making colorful collages.\n\"You can be quirky and wacky and kooky and colorful or you can be dramatic and serious,\" she said.\nSix months into the pandemic and frustrated by the isolation we were all feeling, Hoppe (her name is pronounced \"hope\") decided to share her art with neighbors. And that's why a small red box showed up in her front yard on the corner of North 22nd and Cedar.\n\"At first it was just a reason for me to have a goal every month to produce something interesting and fresh,\" Hoppe said.\nThrough winter, spring, and summer Hoppe always had something new to exhibit in the Tiny Art Gallery on Cedar.\n\"I like so much about it,\" said Tim Miller. \"It's there in a space where it's approachable literally to anyone.\"\nMiller didn't just like the concept. He wanted to contribute. During the summer of 2021, when temperatures hit 108 here, he created a show called Beach Or Tundra, with tiny images painted on plastic fingernails.\n\"It was kind of a comment on how the climate is changing,\" Miller said.\nSteve LaBerge, the artist most responsible for UFO sightings in Tacoma, contributed a show featuring felted space orbs.\n\"You would be amazed at the amount of aliens and observers you can fit in this tiny gallery,\" Hoppe smiled. \"It's pretty impressive.\"\nKim Fits offered bite sized works of art while Vanessa Mercedes celebrated the migratory birds of Mexico and Latin America, a statement about the natural inclination to move from one place to another.\n\"So it's kind of been a fun way to meet folks and help folks get their artwork out,\" Hoppe said.\nOn one of those dreary autumn afternoons when Mother Nature can't make up her mind, Hoppe took down her own Halloween themed show so Tawni Bell could quickly install a 3-D collage in the rain.\n\"Come on magic of math let's do this,\" Bell said. \"Oh my god! It fits perfect! I can't believe it!\"\nBell calls her flowery collage a smile piece. She just wants to brighten someone's day the way Sarah Jane has brightened hers.\n\"It's just amazing,\" she said. \"Because not very many people get asked to put their work into galleries and there are a lot of people who make things.\"\nWhat's inside that little box is a gift for the entire neighborhood.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest.

    "text": "AR3664 is no ordinary sunspot. The behemoth dark patch on the sun’s surface has ballooned in recent days, becoming one of the largest and most active sunspots seen this solar cycle. AR3664 garnered the attention of scientists earlier this week as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center issued a warning of increased solar flare risk from the solar giant on Tuesday (May 7). “Region 3664 has grown considerably and has become much more magnetically complex,” NOAA’s SWPC reports. “This has led to increased solar flare probabilities over the next several days.” The giant sunspot has more than lived up to expectations. Firing out countless powerful solar flares in recent days, including a colossal X-class solar flare this morning (May 9), peaking at 5:13 a.m. EDT (0913 GMT). Solar flares are eruptions from the sun’s surface that emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. They are categorized by size into lettered groups, with X-class being the most powerful. Then there are M-class flares that are 10 times less powerful than X-class flares, followed by C-class flares which are 10 times weaker than M-class flares, B-class are 10 times weaker than C-class flares and finally, A-class flares, which are 10 times weaker than B-class flares and have no noticeable consequences on Earth. Within each class, numbers from 1-10 (and beyond for X-class flares) describe a flare’s relative strength. The X-flare this morning clocked in at X 2.25 according to spaceweatherlive.com, measured by NASA’s GOES-16 satellite. Radio blackouts Shortwave radio blackouts observed over the sunlit portion of Earth at the time of the X-flare eruption. (Image credit: NOAA SWPC) Powerful solar flares like the one observed this morning can cause shortwave radio blackouts on the sunlit side of Earth at the time of the eruption. As such, the X-flare this morning caused shortwave radio blackouts across Europe and Africa as seen in the image above. The radio blackouts are due to the strong pulse of X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation emitted during the eruption. The radiation travels toward Earth at the speed of light and ionizes (gives electrical charge to) the top of Earth’s atmosphere.

Firing out countless powerful solar flares in recent days, including a colossal X-class solar flare this morning (May 9), peaking at 5:13 a.m. EDT (0913 GMT).\nSolar flares are eruptions from the sun’s surface that emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. They are categorized by size into lettered groups, with X-class being the most powerful. Then there are M-class flares that are 10 times less powerful than X-class flares, followed by C-class flares which are 10 times weaker than M-class flares, B-class are 10 times weaker than C-class flares and finally, A-class flares, which are 10 times weaker than B-class flares and have no noticeable consequences on Earth. Within each class, numbers from 1-10 (and beyond for X-class flares) describe a flare’s relative strength.\nThe X-flare this morning clocked in at X 2.25 according to spaceweatherlive.com, measured by NASA’s GOES-16 satellite.\nRadio blackouts\nShortwave radio blackouts observed over the sunlit portion of Earth at the time of the X-flare eruption. (Image credit: NOAA SWPC)\nPowerful solar flares like the one observed this morning can cause shortwave radio blackouts on the sunlit side of Earth at the time of the eruption. As such, the X-flare this morning caused shortwave radio blackouts across Europe and Africa as seen in the image above.\nThe radio blackouts are due to the strong pulse of X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation emitted during the eruption.\nThe radiation travels toward Earth at the speed of light and ionizes (gives electrical charge to) the top of Earth’s atmosphere. (Note: these ionizing X-rays are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by which plasma and magnetic fields erupt from the sun, traveling at slower speeds, often taking several days to reach Earth).\nThis ionization causes a higher-density environment for the high-frequency shortwave radio signals to navigate through in order to support communication over long distances.

Investie dans le Parti démocrate aux États-Unis ce jeudi 22 août, Kamala Harris a affirmé qu&#039;&quot;il est temps de conclure un accord pour un cessez-le-feu&quot;. Lors de son discours en clôture de la convention démocrate qui a acté son investiture pour la présidentielle aux États-Unis, Kamala Harris a promis ce jeudi 22 août de &quot;conclure&quot; un accord pour une trêve dans la bande de Gaza, pilonnée par l&#039;armée israélienne depuis plus de dix mois. La vice-présidente Kamala Harris rencontre le président israélien Isaac Herzog à Washington, aux États-Unis, le 19 juillet 2023. &quot;Le président Biden et moi travaillons vingt-quatre heures sur vingt-quatre car il est temps de conclure un accord pour (libérer) les otages et instaurer un cessez-le-feu&quot;, a déclaré l&#039;actuelle vice-présidente, plaidant également pour &quot;l&#039;auto-détermination&quot; des Palestiniens. &quot;Ce qui s&#039;est passé à Gaza est catastrophique&quot; &quot;Permettez-moi d’être clair et de le dire clairement: je défendrai toujours le droit d&#039;Israël à se défendre, et je veillerai toujours à ce qu&#039;Israël ait la capacité de se défendre, car le peuple israélien ne doit plus jamais faire face à l’horreur qu’une organisation terroriste appelée Hamas a causée le 7 octobre&quot;, a-t-elle d&#039;abord affirmé. &quot;En même temps, ce qui s&#039;est passé à Gaza au cours des dix derniers mois est catastrophique. Tant de vies innocentes ont été perdues, des personnes désespérées et affamées fuient sans cesse pour se mettre en sécurité. L&#039;ampleur de la souffrance est déchirante&quot;, a également ajouté Kamala Harris. Elle a assuré, qu&#039;aux côtés de Joe Biden, elle travaille &quot;pour mettre fin à cette guerre&quot;. &quot;Les otages seront libérés, les souffrances à Gaza cesseront et le peuple palestinien pourra exercer son droit à la dignité, à la sécurité, à la liberté et à l&#039;autodétermination&quot;, a-t-elle conclu sur le sujet. Israël a juré de détruire le Hamas, qui a pris le pouvoir à Gaza en 2007 et qu&#039;il considère comme terroriste, de même que les États-Unis et l&#039;Union européenne. Son armée a lancé en riposte à l&#039;attaque du 7 octobre une offensive d&#039;envergure qui a fait au moins 40.265 morts, selon le ministère de la Santé du gouvernement du Hamas. D&#039;après l&#039;ONU, la plupart des morts sont des femmes et des mineurs.",

    "title": "China reveals first-of-its-kind passenger train with game-changing features: 'Towards a greener, low-carbon future'",
    "text": "The new train could significantly cut down on pollution. China is the world&#039;s leader in high-speed rail, boasting a robust network that has sprung up practically all within the last two decades. Now, the country has revealed the world&#039;s first passenger train made completely from carbon fiber, Interesting Engineering reported. The new train could significantly cut down on pollution, largely thanks to its hugely reduced weight. &quot;In the field of rail transit, a key technology is to reduce the vehicle&#039;s body weight and its energy consumption while ensuring vehicle performance towards a greener, low-carbon future,&quot; Qingdao Sifang, the company behind the train, wrote on Chinese social media app WeChat, as reported by the South China Morning Post. Qingdao Sifang reported that the train has already completed factory testing and will begin operations in a coastal city later this year. The train has achieved a top speed of 87 mph, and Qingdao Sifang estimated that it will use 7% less energy than a standard steel train. Even before this innovation, studies have shown that high-speed rail is the most planet-friendly form of long-distance travel, creating less air pollution per passenger than cars or planes while also minimizing noise pollution and taking up much less space than roadways. China&#039;s high-speed rail system, with its nearly 28,000 miles of track (and counting), is the envy of the rest of the world, with trains that can travel at speeds of up to 125 mph and transport people all over the vast country quickly, cheaply, and efficiently. Recently, the country reported that network operations and maintenance have been fully passed on to artificial intelligence. Watch now: Solar-powered boats from the Honnold Foundation are making a difference in the Amazon Other countries are attempting to catch up. The car-centric United States lags far behind but does have a few projects underway, including the long-awaited California High-Speed Rail network and a burgeoning privately owned high-speed rail network in Florida.

    "title": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force | News and Star",
    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.
