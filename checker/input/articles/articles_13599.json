    "text": "FULLERTON, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 19, 2024 / Amidst continual tensions in the Israel-Palestine conflict, Congressional candidate Cheyenne Hunt becomes the only candidate in her race to call for an immediate ceasefire and a renewed commitment to peace and diplomacy. Recognizing the deep-rooted complexities of this long-standing dispute, Hunt underscores the need for a resolution that respects the dignity and rights of all parties involved.\nCheyenne Hunt for Congress\n\"The situation in Israel and Palestine demands not just our attention but our empathy and understanding,\" stated Hunt. \"While we advocate for a ceasefire, it's crucial to acknowledge both the rights of Israel to engage in a targeted campaign against Hamas after the brutality of Oct. 7 and the rights of the Palestinian people to be free from violence, have their human rights upheld, and to have a path toward statehood. This conflict, with its tragic cycle of violence and suffering, calls for a solution that upholds international law and human rights.\"\nHunt stresses the importance of protecting civilian lives and addressing the humanitarian crisis that affects countless individuals in the region. \"In our pursuit of peace, we must ensure that the fundamental rights and welfare of the civilian population are at the forefront. The international community must come together to provide aid and support to those who are suffering.\"\nReflecting on the broader implications of the conflict, Hunt highlights the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach. \"Peace in the region is not just about negotiating a ceasefire. We must actively oppose extremism in all its forms, whether it's anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim sentiment or the dehumanization of any group.\"\nHunt's stance is rooted in a vision of a future where mutual respect and understanding pave the way for lasting peace. \"While the path to peace may seem daunting, it is our responsibility to strive for a world where future generations of Israelis and Palestinians can live in security and dignity. Let us commit to a discourse that prioritizes our shared humanity and the universal desire for peace.\"\nHunt remains committed to supporting diplomatic efforts and advocating for peace in the region.\nContact Information\nAnnika Albrecht\nannika@ripple-fx.com\n503-935-4504\nSOURCE: Cheyenne Hunt for Congress\nView the original press release on newswire.com.\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "El presidente Vladimir Putin no negó el jueves las afirmaciones de Estados Unidos de que Corea del Norte había enviado soldados a Rusia, pero dijo que dependía de Moscú cómo gestionar su cláusula de defensa mutua con Pyongyang y acusó a Occidente de escalar la guerra en Ucrania. Estados Unidos dijo que había visto pruebas de que Corea del Norte ha enviado 3.000 soldados a Rusia para su posible despliegue en Ucrania, un movimiento que podría marcar una escalada significativa de la guerra en Ucrania. Al ser consultado por un periodista sobre las imágenes de satélite que mostraban movimientos de tropas norcoreanas, Putin dijo: \"Las imágenes son algo serio. Si hay imágenes, entonces reflejan algo\". Este contenido se hizo gracias al apoyo de la comunidad de El Destape. Sumate. Sigamos haciendo historia. Pero afirmó que fue Occidente quien había escalado la crisis ucraniana y dijo que oficiales e instructores de la OTAN estaban directamente implicados en la guerra en Ucrania. \"Sabemos quién está presente allí, de qué países europeos de la OTAN, y cómo llevan a cabo este trabajo\", dijo Putin. El jefe del Kremlin mencionó específicamente el artículo 4 del acuerdo de asociación entre Rusia y Corea del Norte, que trata de la defensa mutua. \"Existe el artículo 4. Nunca hemos dudado lo más mínimo de que los líderes norcoreanos se toman en serio nuestros acuerdos. Pero lo que hagamos en el marco de este artículo es asunto nuestro\", declaró Putin. Dijo que el ejército ruso estaba avanzando a lo largo de todas las secciones del frente en Ucrania, y que había atrapado a un gran número de tropas ucranianas en la región de Kursk.

    "title": "UK's Most Haunted & World's Oldest Prison Miraculously Survives Closure - Focus on Travel News - ftnnews.com",
    "text": "The UK’s most haunted prison, Shepton Mallet Prison, has narrowly escaped closure, much to the relief of history enthusiasts and ghost hunters alike. The world’s oldest prison with a heritage of over 400 years, renowned for its eerie atmosphere and chilling tales, has been a cornerstone of the UK’s dark tourism, attracting visitors from all over the world. Shepton Mallet Prison, with its daunting walls and haunting history, has stood the test of time. Having housed notorious criminals like the Kray Twins and serving as a witness to centuries of turbulent history, the prison has become a symbol of endurance. Its recent brush with closure was met with widespread dismay, as the prospect of losing such a significant piece of history loomed large. However, in a last-minute reprieve, the prison’s fate took a positive turn. Thanks to the efforts of the local community and the site operator Cove Group, a new deal was struck with the prison owners, City & Country. This agreement not only saved the prison from closure but also ensured the preservation of its rich heritage for future generations. Joel Campbell CEO Cove Group said, “We are optimistic about our forthcoming discussions with City & Country and relieved on behalf of our hard-working staff who now know that their jobs are secure into the new year. We would like to thank the local community for their support in recent weeks and hope that this continues as we remain open for business.” The story of [Shepton Mallet Prison](https://www.sheptonmalletprison.com/) is not just about survival; it’s a testament to the growing interest in unique historical sites that offer more than just a glimpse into the past. This interest is mirrored in the rising trend of converting [old prisons into luxury hotels](https://ftnnews.com/2023/12/11/best-luxury-prison-hotels-worldwide/). These establishments, once formidable jailhouses, have been transformed into lavish accommodations, blending historical architecture with modern luxury. One such example is [Het Arresthuis](https://www.booking.com/hotel/nl/het-arresthuis.en.html?aid=811165&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2&label=prison24) in the Netherlands, a former state prison turned into a hotel, where guests can stay in converted cells now equipped with contemporary amenities. Similarly, the [Malmaison Oxford](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/malmaison-oxford.en.html?aid=811165&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2&label=prison24) in England offers a unique experience, where guests can enjoy the luxury of a modern hotel while staying in a building with a rich penal history. The survival of Shepton Mallet Prison adds to this narrative of transformation and preservation. While it has not been converted into a hotel, its continued operation as a historical attraction allows visitors to explore its corridors and cells, experiencing the tangible history that these walls have witnessed. But who knows, maybe the owners may consider turning it into a hotel. What do you think? Would you like to stay in a haunted prison for a night or two? The prison’s survival is not just a victory for heritage preservation; it’s a celebration of the stories and memories embedded within its structure. It’s a place where the past is not forgotten but is instead embraced and shared with those who walk through its gates. The prison offers various tours, including ghost tours and historical walks, allowing visitors to delve into its past, from its earliest days in the 1600s to its closure as a working prison in 2013. Moreover, Shepton Mallet Prison’s story of survival is a beacon of hope for other historical sites facing similar threats. It demonstrates the power of community support and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. As we move forward, it’s crucial to remember the lessons of the past and the stories of places like Shepton Mallet Prison, which continue to fascinate and educate. The miraculous survival of the UK’s most haunted prison is not just a local victory; it’s a global testament to the value of preserving our historical landmarks.
