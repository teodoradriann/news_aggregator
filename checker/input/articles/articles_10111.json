    "text": "Victorian trainers have labelled the move by senior jockeys to refuse to ride in jumpouts from Sunday over a pay dispute as 'disappointing and disrespectful'.\nIn a letter to members, Australian Trainers' Association chief executive Stephen Bell said trainers oppose the jockeys' demand for a jumpout riding fee.\n\"Jumpouts have been seen as part of trackwork and part of the work a jockey does to support trainers and win rides,\" Bell said in his letter.\n\"As a matter of fairness, it was also considered that the riding fees for races and trials have been made high enough to make up for the fact that jumpouts were unpaid for jockeys.\"\nBell said the Victorian Jockeys' Association's decision that their members refuse to ride at the major Victorian jumpouts until a riding fee is negotiated was a 'heavy-handed' tactic to have a fee introduced.\n\"Obviously, it was always a matter of individual negotiation between trainers and jockeys to determine if jockeys got paid additionally for jumpouts and, for example, some retained track riders do get paid,\" Bell said.\n\"Jockeys and riders are contractors and it is up to them to decide which race meetings, jumpouts and trials they ride at.\n\"Usually, if a jockey does not help at jumpouts, they would be less likely to be given race rides.\n\"This time the VJA and a few jockeys are trying to get RV to somehow set fees for jumpouts as a dictate from above, which is a heavy-handed attempt to pressure trainers and owners into paying them to ride in jumpouts.\n\"However, as stated above, we believe this is already effectively compensated in the blend of other fees and amounts they are paid.\n\"Generally, Victorian jockeys are seen as very well treated. In contrast, trainers are currently under more pressure, with major cost-of-living increases and higher bad debts.\"\nBell said it was estimated that the cost of paying jockeys to ride in jumouts would be about $2.21 million and if rolled out to all courses across the state, rise to $3.25m.\n\"Obviously, all that gets passed on to and paid by trainers and owners,\" he said.\n\"In summary, the ATA does not support the current jockeys' jumpout proposal. It is not a sensible or reasonable solution.\n\"The ATA has requested to meet with the VJA and other stakeholders to ascertain a fair and reasonable solution.\"",
