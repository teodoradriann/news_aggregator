    "title": "Joe Jonas ‘Enjoying Spending Time' With Model Stormi Bree Amid Their Romantic Aspen Vacation!",
    "text": "Joe Jonas hit the slopes with his new rumored girlfriend!\nIn case you missed it, the singer sparked rumors he moved on from estranged wife Sophie Turner with 33-year-old model Stormi Bree . Days after performing a New Year’s Eve concert with his brothers, the rumored couple were seen at a private airport leaving Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. We assume she had been there with Joe to ring in 2024. And the couple’s fun times together did not end in Cabo San Lucas!\nRelated: Sophie Turner Calls 2023 ‘Year Of The Girlies’ Amid Joe Jonas Split!\nJoe and Bree seem to have traveled to Aspen, Colorado together, and they even gave fans a look into their romantic ski trip. On Thursday, the 34-year-old took to Instagram Stories to show off footage of his ride on a ski lift making its way up to the top of the mountain. It is unknown if Bree had been sitting next to him on the chair. However, the former Miss Teen USA posted videos on Friday of her following someone down the snowy mountain. See some of the shots from the trip (below):\n(c) Stormi Bree/Instagram (c) Stormi Bree/Instagram, Joe Jonas/Instagram They appear to be having a good time together in Aspen! Neither Joe nor Stormi have addressed their rumored relationship. However, a source for Us Weekly gave some insight into the romance! And it sounds like things are going well between Stormi and Joe so far! The insider said:\n“Joe is enjoying spending time with Stormi. His main priority and focus will always be his children, but at the same time, he’s putting himself out there and is open to what’s to come. Things are still very new, but he’s happy and he’s open to seeing where things go.”\nWe’ll have to see where this romance goes!

    "title": "Seatrium and Solvang ASA Pioneer Carbon Capture Retrofit for LPG Carrier",
    "text": "In an ambitious leap towards maritime decarbonization, Seatrium has clinched a pioneering project that promises to retrofit a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carrier with a full-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Awarded by Solvang ASA, this collaboration marks a significant milestone in the shipping industry's quest to reduce emissions. The project, aiming to capture 70% of carbon dioxide emissions from the vessel's main engine using amine cleaning technology, stands as the first of its kind for an LPG carrier. This endeavor not only highlights the shipping industry's commitment to environmental sustainability but also showcases the increasing momentum of onboard carbon capture technology as a viable solution to lower emissions.\nCharting New Waters in Maritime Emission Reduction\nThe maritime world is sailing towards a cleaner future, with Seatrium and Solvang ASA at the helm. The retrofit project involves a comprehensive approach to carbon management, encompassing the entire value chain from carbon dioxide capture to liquefaction and onboard storage. This groundbreaking initiative is poised to set a precedent for the shipping industry, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of CCS technology in reducing the environmental impact of maritime operations. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) has been instrumental in navigating the complex waters of emerging CCS technology, providing crucial guidelines to integrate this innovative solution into the maritime sector.\nOvercoming the Tides of Challenge\nThe journey towards adopting onboard carbon capture technology is fraught with challenges, including high costs, the complexity of the value chain, and the need for more robust regulation. ABS is actively collaborating with vendors and shipowners to address these hurdles, facilitating the absorption of CCS technology into the maritime industry. The establishment of comprehensive guidelines by ABS plays a pivotal role in this process, offering a beacon of guidance for the industry to align with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) ambitious goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nA Vision for a Greener Maritime Future\nThe successful pilot of the CCS retrofit on the LPG carrier could herald a new era of maritime decarbonization. Solvang ASA has expressed intentions to equip additional vessels with this technology if the project yields positive outcomes. Seatrium anticipates a surge in maritime decarbonization upgrading and retrofitting projects in the coming years, underscoring the industry's dedication to environmental stewardship. With the potential for widespread adoption by 2030, carbon capture technology stands as a beacon of hope in the shipping industry's journey towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.\nAs the maritime industry sets its sights on a greener horizon, the collaboration between Seatrium and Solvang ASA exemplifies the innovative spirit and proactive approach needed to navigate the challenges of decarbonization. This pioneering project not only underscores the feasibility of onboard carbon capture technology but also highlights the shipping industry's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. As the world watches, the success of this venture could pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable maritime sector, aligned with global efforts to combat climate change and protect our planet for future generations.",

    "title": "Pakistan launches location-based SMS alerts to warn millions amid deadly monsoon floods",
    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has launched a location-based SMS alert system to warn citizens in flood-prone areas of imminent weather threats, state media reported on Thursday, as the country grapples with deadly monsoon rains.\nThe system, developed under the Disaster Early Warning System (DEW-3 – Monsoon), is a collaboration between the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Jazz, Pakistan’s largest digital telecom operator. It uses geo-fencing technology to deliver real-time alerts to millions of mobile users living in high-risk zones, enabling timely evacuations or precautionary action.\nThe move comes as torrential rains continue to batter parts of Pakistan, with over 80 killed since the start of the monsoon season in June.\nOver 23 million Jazz subscribers live in areas identified by the NDMA as vulnerable to flooding and other climate-related disasters.\n“This is a powerful demonstration of how public-private collaboration can leverage technology to protect lives and strengthen communities,” Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz, was quoted as saying in the APP statement.\n“Our [Jazz] nationwide reach and location-based capabilities make us uniquely positioned to support NDMA in its mission to minimize disaster-related risks. As the monsoon season continues, this remains an ongoing effort aimed at reaching and protecting even more people in harm’s way.”\nAccording to APP, the system sends out targeted SMS alerts using advanced geo-fencing techniques to people located directly within affected areas. These messages include clear, actionable instructions to help the public respond effectively to natural disasters.\nNDMA acknowledged the partnership with Jazz, “which has enabled them to reach vulnerable populations quickly and effectively, using geo-fenced alerts to ensure no one is left uninformed in times of crisis,” APP reported.\nThe partnership was formalized in March 2025 to enhance Pakistan’s disaster preparedness using digital infrastructure. The system is designed to be scalable and responsive as weather patterns shift or new emergency zones emerge.\nNDMA officials say the alerts are part of a wider effort to modernize disaster response by integrating digital tools and expanding risk communication channels. The authority also disseminates information through the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile app, social media, and mainstream news outlets.\nPakistan has faced increasingly severe climate-related disasters in recent years, from catastrophic floods in 2022 to recurring heatwaves and droughts. The country ranks among the top ten nations most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, underscoring the urgent need for improved early warning and resilience systems.",
