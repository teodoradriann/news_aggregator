    "text": "Case Closed: DNA testing agency changes how investigators solve cold cases LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - A specialized DNA testing agency is helping Kentucky law enforcement agencies close cold cases. This week, Kentucky State Police announced they closed a forty-year-old cold case with the assistance of Othram. Othram uses a process called forensic-grade genome sequencing, where they extract DNA from evidence left at crime scenes and find relatives of the victim or suspect(s). This is different from DNA testing law enforcement agencies perform. They use CODIS, a database with people who’ve been convicted of crimes. When there are no matches in CODIS, investigators look for other ways to generate leads. There are three DNA databases Othram uses to find potential matches: DNA solves, family tree DNA, and GenMatch. All three are authorized by law enforcement to use. “We help law enforcement agencies infer identities and continue their investigations,” Dr. Kristen Mittelman, Othram’s Chief Development officer said. [This year, Othram](https://othram.com/recent_casework.html) helped close 144 cold cases across the country. Shively Police partnered with Othram this year in hopes of finding [the identity of a woman’s remains found in 2005](https://www.wave3.com/2023/12/07/shively-police-search-leads-18-year-cold-case/). “Recently, we have started working very closely with Kentucky law enforcement over the last couple of years,” Dr. Mittelman explained. “I am thrilled that agencies there want to use this technology consistently in their investigations when there’s a DNA dead end.” Last year, a bill called the Carla Walker Act was introduced in the Senate. It’s named after a case that went unsolved for more than four decades. It was solved a few years ago because of advanced DNA testing. If passed, the bill would provide grants for state and local law enforcement agencies to use companies like Othram. “It’s really sad to see that there are cases and requests that have already passed feasibility analysis, so we know they will work,” Dr. Mittelman said. “Unfortunately, they are sitting there because there’s no funding.” Othram’s methods also help police find people who are actively committing crimes but haven’t been caught. A lack of federal funding for Othram and companies like it leaves, even more, unidentified victims and families waiting for justice. Copyright 2023 WAVE. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Crosses carried on the shoulder, sad faces and painful expressions, centuries-old religious traditions. The culmination of the rites of Holy Week you reach the Good Friday when along the streets and alleys of the provincial villages groups of men and women, depicting the Passion and Death of Christ , they parade between prayer and recitation. Processions that have deep cultural and religious roots.\nCoastal Come a Ravello in Amalfi Coast with the Procession of the Dead Christ and the streets surrounded by the singing of the “battenti”, a testimony of ancient practices, first popular and then confraternal, which for centuries have been carried out annually during Holy Week. Hooded men dressed in white, a reminder of the penitents, sing ancient melodies that constitute the cultural heritage of each municipality on the coast, leading a route that winds along the churches. In Ravello, as in Minors where thousands of lights placed on the windowsills create an ethereal scenography, and for example Amalfi . The Good Friday procession in Amalfi is one of the most touching moments of religiosity on the Coast. The town goes out at sunset, illuminated only by the lights of torches and braziers, which accompany the procession and the voices of the choir. After crossing the entire city, the Statue of Christ is placed in the church in Town Hall Square : the Our Lady of Sorrows she then returns, alone, to the cathedral of Sant’Andrea. The organization of this event is entrusted to Archconfraternity of Addolorata of Amalfi .\nCilento Suggestion in Cilento ancient, particularly in the countries around Mount Stella , for the pilgrimages of the brotherhoods to the altars of reposition set up in the churches. From Smoke leaker a Montecorice passing from Rocca Cilento a Sessa Cilento yes Pollica a Stella Cilento there are numerous “congregations” on pilgrimage to the altars of the Reposition . Every town, in some cases even every “farmhouse”, has one. An archaic collective ritual with intense charm. The roles in the congregations, the mozzette of different colors for each one, the birth of the songs: an incredible story. In many villages of Cilento e Vallo di Diano will be staged (in some municipalities it has been brought forward, a Saint Nicholas of Centola was held yesterday) the performance of Living Way of the Cross . It is the day of great devotional depth and popular tradition for Cilento.\nAgro Also suggestive are the processions of the “ Crosses ” o “ whiteners ”, which from the first light of dawn on Good Friday until late morning, travel the streets of Sarno . An ancient rite that has its roots in 1200, when the brotherhoods were established in Sarno.\nIn the capital Tradition also in the city a Salerno with the Way of the Cross through the streets of the Risen Jesus parish. The theme for reflections is: “ The truth of love will set you free ”. The religious procession will make several stops. The last station will be exciting with the deposition of the shroud in the tomb, until the deafening silence in total darkness. Only the voice of the parish priest, Don Giuseppe Landi will echo for the ritual blessing inviting everyone to “ rise again in the Lord with a new heart ”. Also tonight at the Judicial Citadel of Salerno the Parish of San Demetrio and the Prison Pastoral of Salerno organized the Via Crucis for Peace, with the participation of the Archbishop of Salerno-Campagna-Acerno Monsignor Andrea Bellandi next to the parish priest of Saint Demetrius and chaplain of the Salerno prison , Don Rosario Petrone and the president of Court of Salerno but also magistrates, responsible for Penitentiary Police and lawyers. While at the parish Saint Eustace martyr, a suggestive Via Crucis will take place at 7 pm, which will begin in the church and then move to the garden and then reach the fourteenth station: Jesus placed in the tomb. A funerary monument with a large stone that opens to welcome the body of Christ and will then be closed again to be slid away on the night of Easter .\n#Good #Friday #ancient #charm #brotherhoods #stage\n– 2024-03-29 12:51:28",

    "title": "Una gran oportunidad para España: liderar la producción de combustible sostenible de aviación (SAF), según ALA",
    "text": "En el marco de la jornada « Sostenibilidad en la aviación. Visión 2050 «, organizada por la Dirección General de Aviación Civil en las instalaciones de Airbus, la Asociación de Líneas Aéreas (ALA) ha pedido a la Administración que concrete cuanto antes los incentivos fiscales e inversiones directas para favorecer el desarrollo de un mercado de combustible sostenible de aviación (SAF , por sus siglas en inglés) en España, tras su aprobación por el Congreso de los Diputados.\nTal y como ha afirmado Javier Gándara , presidente de ALA, en el transcurso de esa jornada, “ se nos presenta una oportunidad de país que debemos aprovechar tomando la iniciativa con medidas que contribuyan a escalar la producción de SAF en España ”. Así, según esta asociación, una de las claves para avanzar en la implementación del combustible sostenible de aviación (SAF) es la unidad entre el ministerio de Transportes y la industria aeronáutica. El SAF es la solución que el sector identifica como más eficaz a corto plazo y medio plazo, ya que puede reducir entre un 80% y un 100% las emisiones de CO2 a lo largo de su ciclo de vida, sin necesidad de adaptaciones.\nEste tipo de combustible está reconocido como una herramienta clave para el proceso de descarbonización de la industria aérea , promoviendo, además, la economía circular y estimulando el desarrollo económico de las zonas rurales en España, puesto que se produce a partir de residuos agrícolas, urbanos y forestales.\nLos desafíos de este nuevo combustible Respecto a las posibilidades de la citada alianza estratégica, Gándara ha destacado que se trataría del primer paso y esencial para superar los dos principales desafíos que presenta hoy el SAF: la producción a gran escala y la reducción de la brecha de precio respecto al combustible convencional . Los incentivos pueden impulsar este mercado en España y facilitar su adopción, avanzando en la hoja de ruta que se ha marcado el sector aéreo hacia la descarbonización.\n“ Estamos convencidos de que con unidad y diálogo para entender los retos y oportunidades del SAF para la industria y para España, esta solución puede ayudarnos a pisar el acelerador hacia la descarbonización ” , ha recalcado Gándara, quien ha pedido que se acelere la aprobación de estos incentivos que cuentan con el aval del Congreso de los Diputados después de que haya aprobado una Proposición no de Ley que insta al Gobierno a establecerlos, además de inversiones directas para el desarrollo del SAF.",

    "text": "Washington, 13 sep (EFE).- Los trabajadores de Boeing han decidido, después de semanas de negociaciones, ir a una huelga tras rechazar el acuerdo entre los sindicatos y el fabricante estadounidense de aviones, que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25 % en cuatros años y que consideran insuficiente.\nSería la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años. La anterior fue en 2008 y tuvo un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción y le costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como WSJ y FT.\nEn concreto, cerca del 95 % de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) ha votado en contra del acuerdo que incluía el citado incremento salarial hasta 2027.\nEn este sentido, señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento salarial y a tenor del aumento del coste de la vida.\nEsta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines en pleno vuelo, y acentuará la falta de aviones en el sector aéreo.\nEn el marco de las negociaciones, el reciente director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido a los trabajadores que no hicieran huelga y realizó algunas visitas a las fábricas.\nLos miembros del Distrito 751 de la IAM representa a unos 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing.

    "text": "ATE suspendió a “Shakira”, la delegada municipal imputada por narcotráfico en Roca\nSe trata de Claudia Padilla que lideraba una banda narco en el norte de la ciudad.\nDesde el gremio ATE confirmaron que fue suspendida la\n delegada municipal imputada por liderar una banda narco. Se trata de Claudia Padilla, conocida como Shakira.\nFederico Gabarra, secretario de la seccional de Roca informó que la mujer no es parte de la comisión directiva. “Fue elegida por los compañeros del sector como delegada. Era delegada sectorial, no miembro de la conducción del sindicato”, indicó.\nEn el comunicado que difundieron señalan que “ATE resolvió suspender la afiliación y separar preventivamente de su cargo a la delegada sindical en la Municipalidad de General Roca (Río Negro) Claudia Padilla a partir de los hechos de público conocimiento y la presunción de que podría encontrase involucrada en un delito. La decisión se ampara en los artículos 11 (incisos a y c), 13 (inciso e) y 31 del Estatuto Social de la entidad, luego de tomar conocimiento de la presunta participación en hechos delictivos”.\n“El sindicato tomó la decisión hasta tanto la Justicia determine si existió grado de responsabilidad y participación en los hechos que se le acusan fundamentando que podrían acarrear graves perjuicios a la asociación sindical”, detallaron.\n“Cabe destacar que los investigadores del Poder Judicial ya indicaron que dicha actividad no está relacionada ni con su trabajo municipal o con el sindicato, sino que fue realizada en el ámbito privado”, concluyeron.\nMujer de Roca lideraba una banda narco: quiénes la integraban y dónde operaban\nLa banda narco conformada por una familia que residía en la zona norte de la ciudad estaba integrada por la empleada municipal, su pareja y sus dos hijos, estos eran los encargados del «aprovisionamiento del búnker y la recaudación del dinero». También formaban parte la madre de la mujer y su hermano, quiénes cumplían el rol de «centinelas» y alertaban la presencia de policías. En el último eslabón de la banda se encontraba los «dilers», estos realizaban turnos por días.\nA raíz de la investigación quedó imputada la empleada municipal de 43 años que lideraba la banda, su madre de 64 años, sus hermanos de 23 y 27 años, su esposo de 32, sus hijos de 20 y 25 años y su nuera de 20.\nFuentes cercanas al caso indicaron que fueron demorados y no quedaron detenidos. Los 8 fueron imputados por la Justicia Federal por violar la ley de estupefacientes.",
