    "text": "An apparent drive-by shooting in South Toledo left a man dead Thursday, authorities said. The shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. in the 2400 block of Broadway, Toledo police said at the scene. Mark Overton, 35, who police said suffered at least one gunshot wound, was pronounced dead at the University of Toledo Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio Hospital, according to a police report. No suspect had been identified. Circumstances leading to the shooting remained under investigation. Overton appeared to have been driving south on Broadway when the shooting occurred, Sgt. Roy Kennedy said. After he was shot, the SUV continued about 200 yards before the driver lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a parked car on the northbound side of Broadway. Police believe Overton was alone in the vehicle and no one else appears to have been injured, Sergeant Kennedy said. Bullet holes were visible in the hood and passenger side front window of the SUV. The death was being investigated as a homicide, which would be the 43rd of 2023 in Toledo . An official cause of death is pending an autopsy by the Lucas County Coroner’s Office. “This is outrageous, this is unacceptable,” Toledo city councilman Cerssandra McPherson said about gun violence continuing in the city in broad daylight. “...There’s no quick fix, but we gotta get these guns off the streets.” Traffic was blocked off along Broadway near Lorain Street on Thursday afternoon as authorities continued their work.

    "text": "Otro drama en la defensa del Betis: Chadi Riad va a la CAN Walid Regragui, seleccionador de Marruecos, convoca al central verdiblanco para la Copa de África que se disputará en Costa de Marfil. Problema gordo para el Betis y su defensa. Uno más esta temporada. Los peores presagios se han confirmado y tras aparecer en la prelista de Marruecos para la Copa de África, Chadi Riad ha sido citado oficialmente para formar parte del equipo que estará en Costa de Marfil a comienzos de este 2024. El notable rendimiento de central verdiblanco no ha pasado desapercibido para Walid Regragui, seleccionador del combinado marroquí. De este modo, Chadi Riad podrá debutar oficialmente con el combinado absoluto de su país después de haber sido un habitual en las convocatorias de la selección sub 23. Luicirá el dorsal número 18. De este modo, Manuel Pellegrini sólo podrá contar con Pezzella y Sokratis como centrales puros mientras Marruecos siga vivo en el torneo. La opción de Marc Roca como defensor dejará de ser una solución de emergencia en Europa y también tendrá que estar presente en el campeonato liguero y en la Copa del Rey. Ahora, el Betis trabajará para que Chadi Riad, al menos, pueda estar contra el Celta el próximo 3 de enero. Tal y como se esperaba, Abde también forma parte de la convocatoria de Marruecos, así como el delantero del Sevilla En Nesyri.
