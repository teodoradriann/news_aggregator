    "text": "News Shooting for the Moon: Christina Koch’s Historic Journey From Johns Hopkins APL to Space Astronaut and former APL electrical engineer Christina Koch delivers a colloquium on human spaceflight Dec. 1 at the Kossiakoff Center. Credit: Johns Hopkins APL/Craig Weiman Fri, 01/05/2024 - 16:15 Brett Molina As Christina Koch watched NASA’s Juno mission launch in 2011 from the Cape Canaveral grandstands in Florida, she thought that moment was the closest she’d get to fulfilling her dream of going to space. The former electrical engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) worked on Juno’s [Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument](https://space.jhuapl.edu/destinations/instruments/jedi) (JEDI) during her two-year stint, leaving her feeling satisfied knowing the detectors would contribute to space exploration. In December, Koch returned to the APL campus in Laurel, Maryland, to deliver a colloquium on human spaceflight. Not only had she fully realized her dream of traveling to space, but she now owns the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman in human history at 328 days. She is one of four NASA astronauts chosen for the agency’s Artemis II flight test to the Moon. “I have a lot of fond memories working at APL,” Koch said after her talk, in which she described her career path from the Antarctic to the International Space Station (ISS). “I had a lot of great mentors and great friends here. The culture here is very positive, encouraging and super intellectual, which I love.” From APL to ISS Koch started her career with roles at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the United States Antarctic Program, which included a yearlong stay at the South Pole. In 2007, she joined APL as an electrical engineer and worked on JEDI, used on NASA’s Juno mission to explore our solar system’s largest planet. Koch also assisted with the development of the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment, used on the [Van Allen Probes](https://space.jhuapl.edu/destinations/missions/van-allen-probes), which provided crucial insight into Earth’s radiation belts. Former APL colleagues recall Koch’s deep knowledge of electrical engineering and physics and her positive, can-do attitude. “It was a pleasure to work with her,” said Chuck Schlemm, a space systems engineer who teamed with Koch when she worked at APL. “Her mindset was that everything had a solution and she was working on it.” [Barry Mauk](https://space.jhuapl.edu/people/barry-mauk), who served as lead co-investigator on JEDI, said Koch played a big role in designing and implementing calibration systems and managing a particle accelerator capable of testing the instrument’s sensors in four dimensions. “It turned out to be absolutely critical for calibrating,” recalled Mauk. “Her staging device made that so much easier.” Koch resumed remote scientific field work with stops in Antarctica and Greenland before NASA accepted her into the astronaut training program in 2013. Koch said she had to learn “five new careers in two years” when training to become an astronaut. Credit: Johns Hopkins APL/Craig Weiman The APL Influence Koch had always shied away from talking about records. In her mind, she wanted to stay humble and focus on the mission. That’s until she received an email from a former APL colleague. After her mission on the ISS was extended to a record-breaking duration, Schlemm congratulated his former co-worker in an email. After Koch downplayed the accolade, Schlemm reminded her how much milestones mean to other people. “I realized that I was taking that away from people in not recognizing it myself,” she said. “That was really a pivotal moment for me because it gave me the impression that what I had the honor of doing was for so many more people than just me or the immediate space program.” “I hadn’t really intended it but it sounded like it sort of changed her perspective from there forward, so it put me over the moon,” Schlemm said after hearing Koch tell the story of that email. APL has helped shape Koch’s career in other ways, too. She said the Lab helped her learn about patience when working with complex systems, as well as about teamwork and leadership since she served as both a team lead and hardware lead during her tenure. “I remember just being surprised that people believed in me so much, and it caused me to really look for what they saw and start to believe in myself more,” she said. To commemorate her time at APL, Koch brought a Juno patch and lapel pin to the ISS, which she then returned to the Lab as a memento to honor her former colleagues. Through Adversity to the Stars Koch said she had to “learn five new careers in two years.” Training required learning how to fly a jet, operate a robotic arm, navigate the ISS’s systems and speak Russian. Koch also trained at NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab, a 200-foot-long indoor pool that astronaut prospects use to practice spacewalks. “My job was to show up and be bad at something to try to figure it out, because basically that’s how it felt,” Koch joked about her experience in astronaut training. Koch’s first voyage as an astronaut was an 11-month visit to the ISS. She said that first view of Earth from the station left her in awe. “It just completely surprised me how moving it was to see the perspective of your home in its actual place in a bigger universe,” Koch said. “It was incredible.” During three ISS expeditions, she [helped test free-flying robotic assistants](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-59/), [tested a three-dimensional bioprinter](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-60/), and [helped extend the life span of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-61/), which collects and analyzes information from stars and galaxies millions of light years from the Milky Way. Koch participated in 14 spacewalks during her time on the ISS, either in support of others outside the station or as an active member of the spacewalk itself. She also made history in 2019 as part of the [first all-woman spacewalk](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2019/10/18/nasa-astronauts-wrap-up-historic-all-woman-spacewalk/). Koch said what made that spacewalk so special was that its goal was mapped out in roughly a week, whereas a typical spacewalk is planned years in advance. “We worked with ground teams for a week, figuring out how we could do this spacewalk to fix something that broke unexpectedly, and we made it happen,” said Koch. “It was an absolutely awesome experience.” Astronaut and former APL electrical engineer Christina Koch poses with members of the Space Exploration Sector’s Space Science Instrumentation Group and Space Science Electronics Group. Credit: Johns Hopkins APL/Craig Weiman Living the Space Life What exactly do you do in space when you’re not working? Astronauts receive supplies through cargo vehicles that fly in formation with the ISS before they’re snatched up by the robotic arm and docked at the station. Once astronauts unpack all the new food, science instruments and supplies, they load up the cargo vehicle with trash and set it free, where it eventually burns up in the atmosphere. The ISS is equipped with resistance machines so astronauts can minimize loss of muscle or bone density. Astronauts sleep in rooms the size of a phone booth while inside a sleeping bag so they don’t float away while snoozing. And there’s room for some fun, too, as demonstrated by a clip Koch showed of her and another astronaut playing pickleball with a blob of water. “I’m not great at sports on Earth, but I can catch a football in space,” Koch said to laughter from the APL colloquium crowd. In 2020, after a record-setting 328 days, Koch returned to Earth. “I loved it on the ISS,” she said. “When it was time to come home realizing that this mission had actually happened and I — no kidding — was going to see my family again, it was absolutely overwhelmingly joyful.” The Applied Physics Laboratory, a not-for-profit division of The Johns Hopkins University, meets critical national challenges through the innovative application of science and technology.

    "text": "Un estudio reciente realizado por la plataforma\nPreply ha arrojado luz sobre las ciudades de España percibidas como las más maleducadas, según sus propios habitantes. En este análisis, que involucró a más de 1.500 residentes de 19 áreas diferentes del país, se evaluó la frecuencia con la que las personas se encuentran con comportamientos considerados groseros, así como la percepción sobre quiénes son más maleducados, si los locales o los visitantes.\nDe acuerdo con los resultados del estudio, Santa Cruz de Tenerife encabeza la lista de las ciudades con mayores índices de mala educación, con una puntuación media de 6,06 sobre 10. Este dato sitúa a la capital tinerfeña como la ciudad percibida por sus propios residentes como la más maleducada de España.\nEn el contexto general del estudio, otras ciudades que también figuran en la parte alta de este ranking son Granada, con una puntuación de 5,95, y Alicante-Elche, con 5,81. Estos datos reflejan que la percepción sobre la falta de cortesía no se limita a una región específica, sino que se distribuye a lo largo de diferentes áreas del país.\nLa ciudad canaria que figura entre las más educadas\nPor otro lado, en el extremo opuesto, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria destaca como una de las ciudades más educadas de España, ocupando la sexta posición con una puntuación de 5,39, en una lista liderada por Vigo. Esto la sitúa entre las áreas donde los residentes consideran que la buena educación predomina en mayor medida.\nEl estudio también exploró las causas más comunes que llevan a las personas a ser percibidas como maleducadas. Entre los comportamientos señalados, “estar constantemente al teléfono en público” es el más citado, seguido por “no acoger a los forasteros”, “ver vídeos en público”, “montar bullicio” y “dar propina”.\nEn cuanto a la percepción sobre si los comportamientos maleducados provienen más de los locales o de los visitantes, los resultados fueron variados. Un 26,04 % de los encuestados señaló que los residentes son más maleducados, mientras que un 21,25 % opinó que los no residentes tienen peor comportamiento. Además, un 40,97 % de los participantes consideró que no hay una gran diferencia entre ambos grupos, mientras que un 11,74 % no supo qué respuesta dar.\nEste análisis proporciona una visión interesante sobre cómo los propios residentes perciben el comportamiento social en diferentes ciudades españolas, destacando tanto las áreas con mayor percepción de mala educación como aquellas donde se valora más la cortesía.",

    "text": "BALTIMORE - The main weather story this week will be the colder temperatures arriving, making it feel much more like fall.\nAfter a beautiful Sunday afternoon, clouds will increase across the area tonight. A cold front is expected to move through the region by early Monday morning. There is a slight chance for a stray shower with the front as it passes late tonight, particularly in Western Maryland. A few showers could reach as far east as areas west of I-95 through the morning hours. Any showers that do occur should end by sunrise on Monday.\nOvernight temperatures will only dip into the upper 50s to around 60 degrees, but high temperatures on Monday will struggle to get out of the 60s. Another noticeable factor on Monday will be the stronger winds. Gusty northwest winds, in the wake of the cold front, will reach over 30 mph at times, with the strongest winds expected from mid-morning through mid-afternoon. Monday's high temperatures will reach the mid-60s.\nMonday night will mark the beginning of several chilly nights, potentially the coldest of the season so far. Low temperatures will dip into the lower 40s for most areas. However, cloud cover and gusty northwest winds should keep temperatures from falling into the 30s.\nExpect mostly cloudy skies on Tuesday, with a stray sprinkle possible during the afternoon. High temperatures will remain in the low to mid-50s. Tuesday night will be quite chilly, with lows dropping into the upper 30s to around 40 degrees. Highs on Wednesday will reach the mid-50s again.\nThe coldest nights of the week will be Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures dipping well into the 30s across parts of the region. There will be a moderate risk of the season's first frost on both nights, so it's important to take precautions to protect cold-sensitive plants.\nHigh temperatures on Thursday afternoon will rebound into the 60s, with highs reaching the mid-60s on Friday. The warm-up will continue through the weekend, with sunny skies and highs near 70 degrees for both Saturday and Sunday. Low temperatures at night will dip into the lower 40s.\nNext week will start on a mild and sunny note, with sunny skies and highs around 70 degrees. Low temperatures at night will drop into the upper 40s and lower 50s.\nMore from CBS News Baltimore man found shot dead in vehicle overnight in Columbia, Howard County Police investigating Jackson outduels Daniels and Henry runs for two TDs as Ravens beat Commanders 30-23 Baltimore's first refillery offers eco-friendly household essentials, wellness products Howard County Police investigate shooting, injuring two teens in Columbia Two-alarm Essex fire leaves several displaced, one firefighter injured Derek Beasley Derek Beasley joined the WJZ First Alert Weather Team in March 2022.
