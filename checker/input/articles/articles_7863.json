    "title": "AG: Rule hits gun show attendance",
    "text": "By By Jim Saunders News Service of Florida ,\n20 minutes ago\nTALLAHASSEE — Florida this week revamped a lawsuit that challenges a new federal rule requiring more gun sellers to be licensed and run background checks on buyers, in part pointing to lower attendance at gun shows.\nLawyers for the state raised the gun-show issue because they said the rule is reducing tax revenue from purchases of admission tickets.\nBiden administration attorneys last month argued that an initial version of the lawsuit should be dismissed because the state had not shown legal standing — an issue that lost tax revenue could address.\nThe revised lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tampa, said the state’s “asserted injury — lost tax revenue — is clear and ongoing.”\n“Ordinarily, gun shows in Florida during the summer months of June, July and August enjoy high attendance rates — often hosting thousands of people at a single show,” lawyers in Attorney General Ashley Moody’s office wrote. “But since the challenged rule went into effect on May 20, attendance at these summer gun shows across the state has decreased precipitously. In some parts of Florida, total attendance at such shows have dropped by as much as 50%, costing the state revenue from the 6% sales tax it would have earned on each admission ticket.”\nMoody filed the initial version of the lawsuit May 1, shortly after the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives finalized the rule.\nThe rule is an outgrowth of a 2022 federal law, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, that made changes to the longstanding background-check system.\nWhen the rule was finalized, the Biden administration said it was designed to close “loopholes” in the system that requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks. An overview posted on the White House website said “a growing number of unlicensed sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they meet at gun shows and online marketplaces, which has been a critical gap in the background check laws.”\nIn part, the rule changed a definition of being “engaged in the business” as a firearms dealer who needs to be licensed, according to a motion filed last month by U.S. Department of Justice attorneys seeking to dismiss the initial version of the lawsuit. The revised definition applies to a “person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to predominantly earn a profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. The term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of the person’s personal collection of firearms.”\nJustice Department attorneys argued in the motion that the definition closely tracks the 2022 law. But Florida contends the rule violates what is known as the federal Administrative Procedure Act, saying in the revised lawsuit that the “Biden Administration now seeks to exploit the minor changes to federal law enacted in the BSCA (Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) to implement President Biden’s preferred policies by executive fiat.”\nWhile most states rely on the FBI to conduct background checks, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement handles checks in Florida.\nIn both the initial and revised versions of its lawsuit, the state’s attorneys argued that the rule would force the FDLE to conduct more background checks, requiring more resources.\nBut in trying to show Florida has legal standing, the revised lawsuit added the gun-show tax issue issue and said the rule could pressure the state to change background-check laws.\nThe revised lawsuit said Florida has “enacted a statute in reliance on the status quo, and defendants have disrupted that status quo through implementation of an unlawful regulation.”\nBut in the motion to dismiss the initial version of the lawsuit, Justice Department attorneys said Florida “has made the voluntary decision to add a layer of bureaucracy” and, as a result, does not have standing to challenge the rule.\n“The Federal Bureau of Investigation operates the federal firearms background check system and offers full background check services to states for free,” the motion said. “The majority of states rely on the FBI to conduct background checks, and those states incur no costs or burdens relating to background checks. The federal government has not forced Florida to conduct background checks; Florida has voluntarily taken on that burden.”\nAfter the revised lawsuit was filed, U.S. District Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell on Tuesday issued an order that said the motion to dismiss the initial version was moot.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak\nComments / 0 Add a Comment YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Most Popular Law Signed By DeSantis Makes It Illegal To Release Balloons In Florida Florida State 17 days ago Man Driving Vehicle Registered to Tyreek Hill Arrested on Drug Trafficking Charges in Douglas Douglas, GA 21 days ago Three Starkville city employees arrested for stealing rolls of trash bags Starkville, MS 14 days ago Rare Atlantic sturgeon washes ashore on South Carolina beach Colleton County, SC 20 days ago Colorado legalizes needles, pipes for meth and crack if obtained by harm reduction group Colorado State 15 days ago The Largest Cruise Ship in the World is Sailing at 132% Capacity: How This is Even Possible J.

    "text": "Oregon man reported missing on Christmas Day found alive in a dry well after 2 days [Saman Shafiq](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12168535002/saman-shafiq/) A man, who was reported missing on Christmas Day in Oregon, was found alive Wednesday afternoon in a dry well several blocks from his home, the [Bend Police Department](https://www.bendoregon.gov/government/departments/police/) said. John Michael McLerran, 34, was reported to be missing on Monday, Dec. 25, after authorities responded to a welfare check around 5:30 p.m. McLerran had left his home in midtown Bend to get coffee but never returned. Police said that McLerran did not take his wallet or identification with him. Two days later, on Wednesday around 3 p.m., a community member called 911 to report that they had found McLerran stuck about six feet below street level in a dry well inside the parking lot of a gated storage unit site. Bend Police and the city's Fire & Rescue Department responded to the scene and were able to retrieve McLerran from the drain. He was later taken to a local hospital for evaluation, said the police, and is in good condition. No foul play Police said that it appeared that McLerran got into the dry well on his own and that there was no foul play. \"Our officers reviewed surveillance footage from the storage unit site and determined no criminal wrongdoing took place,\" said the police.

    "text": "Ocio Posidonia: El único festival con garantía de residuo cero El SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia de Formentera acaba de ser reconocido como el único festival del mundo que alcanza la certificación TRUE Platinum por sus esfuerzos para ser Zero Waste o Residuo Cero. El afán de la cita por seguir mejorando año a año da un paso más tras lograr ser cero emisiones desde su edición de 2021. La certificación TRUE® (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) como Zero Waste pertenece y está administrada por Green Business Certification Inc (GBCI®), el organismo de certificación y acreditación de sostenibilidad y salud líder en el mundo. Los proyectos TRUE deben desviar el 90% o más de sus residuos del vertedero, la incineración (conversión de residuos en energía) y el medio ambiente. SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia alcanzó una impresionante tasa de desviación de residuos del 99,3%. «SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia apuesta de forma definitiva por la economía circular optimizando la reducción y la reutilización en todo lo relativo a consumo durante el evento: envases, platos, vasos y demás enseres, sin descartar al mismo tiempo el reciclaje, aunque siempre como última opción. En el festival no existen contenedores sino estaciones de reciclaje que aseguran que la escasa producción de residuos se analiza y separa correctamente: en 2023 solo se generaron 25 kg de residuos cuya tasa de reciclaje fue del mencionado 99,3 %», destacan los organizadores en una nota, en la que agradecen la colaboración del público. «La concienciación del público asistente se impulsa a través de canales de comunicación con whatsapp o acciones y activaciones que forman parte del programa del festival, como son los paseos guiados por Formentera de la mano de expertos en medio ambiente o la limpieza de playas, que el año pasado propició la transformación de 26 kg de plástico en objetos como vinilos o maceteros para que tuvieran una nueva vida», destacan. Este año, SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia se celebrará del 4 al 6 de octubre bajo el nombre de ‘Capítulo Ocho Cero: Raíces’. Así, la isla de Formentera, territorio con un valor ecológico incalculable, será testigo de una vuelta a sus orígenes con formatos más disruptivos para esta octava edición, manteniendo su objetivo de (re)descubrir los paisajes de Formentera a través de los conciertos de su característico cartel secreto, de la gastronomía local impulsada por chefs con Estrella Michelín y, por supuesto, de la cerveza. «Carácter inconformista» «Para quienes creamos SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia es un verdadero orgullo que sea el único festival del mundo que alcanza esta certificación hasta la fecha, reflejo de nuestro carácter inconformista. Sabemos que no somos perfectos, pero año a año trabajamos para seguir mejorando, ofreciendo un modelo diferenciador en el que todo parta del impacto positivo. Es realmente reconfortante ver cómo nuestro mensaje cala en el público del festival, los aliados locales y el equipo, sin quienes sería imposible conseguirlo», declara Víctor Mantiñán, director del festival y responsable global de Patrocinios Musicales y de Comunicación de Impacto Positivo de Hijos de Rivera. «Zero Waste es una parte poderosa de la estrategia de sostenibilidad de cualquier empresa», afirma Peter Templeton, presidente y CEO de U.S. Green Building Council & GBCI. «A través de su certificación TRUE, SON Estrella Galicia Posidonia mejora sus operaciones de una manera que maximiza el ciclo de vida de cada producto para promover un modelo circular dentro del recinto del festival».

    "text": "The CWC&apos;s analysis also indicated a week-on-week decrease in storage levels, affecting not only the southern region but also the nation as a whole.\nAs of last Thursday, the southern region&apos;s reservoir capacity stood at 16 per cent, dropping from 17 per cent the previous week.\nThe bulletin from the CWC said the southern region has been severely impacted, with reservoirs operating at only 15 per cent of their total live storage capacity.\nThe data from the CWC shows that storage levels this year are lower than both the corresponding period last year and the ten-year average for the same period.\nNationally, out of 150 monitored reservoirs, the total live storage capacity is 178.784 billion cubic metres (BCM), approximately 69.35 per cent of the estimated 257.812 BCM created across the country.\nHowever, the live storage available in these reservoirs currently sits at 27 per cent, down from 36 per cent recorded last year and 32 per cent on average over the past decade.\nCompared with historical data, the bulletin highlights that the current live storage is only 79 per cent of last year&apos;s levels and 92 per cent of the 10-year average for the corresponding period.\nThe storage during the current year is lower than that of the corresponding period last year in all of the country while it is below the average storage of the last 10 years during the corresponding period in northern, eastern southern and western.\nThe southern region, encompassing Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, has a total live storage capacity of 53.334 BCM. According to the reservoir storage bulletin dated May 9, the available live storage in these reservoirs is 7.921 BCM, constituting only 15 per cent of their total capacity.\nIn comparison, last year&apos;s storage during the corresponding period was 27 per cent, and the 10-year average was 21 per cent of the live storage capacity.\nThe northern region, which comprises Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Rajasthan, has 10 reservoirs under CWC monitoring with a total live storage capacity of 19.663 BCM. The bulletin reports the current live storage available in these reservoirs at 5.759 BCM, representing 29 per cent of the total live storage capacity.\nDuring the corresponding period last year, the storage was 37 per cent, and the 10-year average was 33 per cent of the live storage capacity.\nSimilarly, the eastern region, including Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura, Nagaland, and Bihar, has 23 reservoirs with a total live storage capacity of 20.430 BCM. The live storage available in these reservoirs currently stands at 6.952 BCM, which is 34 per cent of the total live storage capacity.\nIn contrast, last year&apos;s storage during the corresponding period was 31 per cent, while the 10-year average was 34.2 per cent of the live storage capacity.\nThe western region, covering Gujarat and Maharashtra, has a total live storage capacity of 37.130 BCM. As per the reservoir storage bulletin, the available live storage in these reservoirs is 10.339 BCM, which is 28 per cent of the total live storage capacity.\nCompared with last year&apos;s storage during the corresponding period (34 per cent) and the 10-year average (29 per cent), the current year&apos;s storage is notably lower.\nLastly, the central region, comprising Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh, has 26 reservoirs under CWC monitoring with a total live storage capacity of 48.227 BCM. The live storage available in these reservoirs is reported at 16.687 BCM, representing 35 per cent of the total live storage capacity.\nWhile this is a decline from last year&apos;s 41 per cent, it is an improvement compared to the ten-year average of 33 per cent during the corresponding period.",

    "title": "75 años del paso El Señor Atado a la Columna",
    "text": "Hace 75 años salió por primera vez a las calles de Zaragoza Señor Atado a la Columna, el paso titular de la Columna. La cofradía ha celebrado este aniversario durante todo un año, según explica Jesús Cortés, el Hermano Mayor de la misma. Pero \\\"el broche final\\\", comenta Cortés, fue la procesión adelantada que realizaron el 24 de febrero, una conmemoración a esta figura tan importante en la capital aragonesa. Jesús cuenta cómo la vivieron: \\\"Fue extraordinario en todos los sentidos: por el tiempo, por la participación, por el público, por la emotividad... No pudo salir mejor\\\". Este adelanto de los días de la pasión contó con varios detalles que hicieron de este acto una procesión diferente a las que vamos a poder ver durante la Semana Santa. Por ejemplo, en lugar de salir con los cinco pasos habituales, lo hicieron solo con el del Señor Atado a la Columna. Cortés comenta que otra de las diferencias fue que \\\"los tambores tocaron en una sola sección en lugar de en tres distintas\\\". La figura del Señor atado a la Columna es, desde 1949, un símbolo de la Semana Santa zaragozana. Fue en esa fecha cuando esta obra, creación del escultor aragonés José Bueno, se expuso en La Lonja. \\\"Ya entonces fue muy relevante porque fue la única imagen que se expuso sola. A la mañana siguiente hubo muchas críticas de arte sobre ella\\\", explica Jesús Cortés. Aunque en este edificio se han hecho otras exhibiciones relacionadas con la Semana Santa, según comenta Cortés, esta tuvo un rasgo diferencial: \\\"Todas tenían varias imágenes, pero la del Señor atado a la Columna se expuso sola, sin otras imágenes\\\". Debido a su importancia, la Columna decidió rendir un homenaje a José Bueno en la procesión adelantada realizada en febrero. El acto tuvo lugar en la Magdalena, iglesia que, junto a la de San Cayetano, San Juan de los Panetes y Santiago el Mayor ha sido sede de esta cofradía a lo largo de la historia. La ceremonia, como explica Cortés, consistió en lo siguiente: \\\"Emitimos un audio que es un diálogo entre el escultor y la figura de Jesús. El acto emocionó mucho a los cofrades\\\". Su intención fue clara: \\\"Quisimos enseñar artística y religiosamente la imagen de la Columna, pero también la del escultor\\\", dijo el Hermano Mayor. Y añade: \\\"Ensalzamos su figura porque fue una persona aragonesa importante. Realizó obras muy famosas como la de Alfonso I el Batallador en el parque José Antonio Labordeta\\\". La Columna también aportó otra novedad en su adelanto de los días de la pasión: el estreno de 'Origen', su nueva marcha. “Salió muy bien, y eso que íbamos un poco justos porque habíamos tenido pocos días para ensayarla”, afirma Cortés. Esta ya forma parte del patrimonio musical de las cofradías de la ciudad, y la vamos a poder escuchar a lo largo de Semana Santa. Según explica el Hermano Mayor, la ciudad acogió la procesión con \\\"mucha emotividad\\\" porque \\\"el talle de la figura impresiona. Si estuviera de pie, mediría 36 centímetros\\\". La cofradía hizo una previa movilización por redes sociales que generó mucha expectación porque, además de la celebración, su procesión adelantada iba a suponer la exposición de la renovación del Señor Atado a la Columna. Cortés comunica cuáles han sido las reformas que han hecho en su paso titular: \\\"Hemos recuperado las cuatro águilas de San Juan Bautista que se perdieron hace muchos años y que franquean las cuatro esquinas de la Columna. También tiene una greca nueva, y el suelo ahora tiene electricidad\\\". Cortés ha comentado que a la cofradía todavía le queda mucho tiempo por delante, y que \\\"esto no para\\\". “Este año hemos notado un crecimiento muy fuerte. Solo en la sección de instrumentos ya tenemos 580 personas apuntadas”, remarca. El objetivo de la Columna para los días de Semana Santa es claro: \\\"Salimos a la calle para hacer una manifestación pública de nuestra fe\\\".",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

The duration of its presence in your system depends on several factors, including the amount and type of the drug consumed, the individual’s metabolism, and the method of testing used to detect it.\nHalf-Life of MDMA\nMDMA has a half-life of around 8-12 hours, which means that the amount of the drug in your system is reduced by half every 8-12 hours. However, this does not mean that the drug is completely eliminated from your system after this period. The full effects of MDMA can last for up to 6-8 hours, and the drug can still be detectable in your system for several days after consumption.\nExcretion of MDMA\nThe majority of MDMA is excreted in the urine, with smaller amounts excreted in the feces and sweat. The excretion rate of MDMA is influenced by factors such as urine pH, flow rate, and concentration of the drug.\nExcretion Rate (h)\nUrine pH\nFlow Rate (mL/min)\nConcentration (μg/mL)\n2-4 hours\n5.5-6.5\n1-2\n10-20\n4-8 hours\n6.5-7.5\n2-4\n5-10\n8-12 hours\n7.5-8.5\n4-6\n1-5\nDetection of MDMA\nMDMA can be detected in your system using various testing methods, including:\nUrine tests: These tests detect the presence of MDMA metabolites, such as MDA and MDEA, in your urine. MDMA can be detected in urine for up to 72 hours after consumption.\nBlood tests: Blood tests detect the presence of MDMA and its metabolites in your bloodstream. MDMA can be detected in blood for up to 24 hours after consumption.\nHair tests: Hair tests detect the presence of MDMA metabolites in your hair. MDMA can be detected in hair for up to 90 days after consumption.\nSaliva tests: Saliva tests detect the presence of MDMA and its metabolites in your saliva. MDMA can be detected in saliva for up to 12 hours after consumption.\nFactors that Affect MDMA Detection\nSeveral factors can affect the detection of MDMA, including:\nDosage : Larger doses of MDMA can increase the detection time of the drug in your system.\nFrequency of use : Regular use of MDMA can increase the detection time of the drug in your system.\nBody composition : Individuals with a higher body fat percentage may have a slower excretion rate of MDMA, making it detectable for a longer period.\nAge and gender : MDMA detection times may vary depending on age and gender.\nConsequences of MDMA Use\nMDMA can have serious consequences, including:\nOverdose : Taking too much MDMA can lead to life-threatening complications, including hyperthermia, dehydration, and cardiac arrest.\nAddiction : MDMA can be addictive, and regular use can lead to withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped.\nLong-term effects : Repeated use of MDMA has been linked to long-term effects, including memory impairment, anxiety, and depression.\nConclusion\nMDMA can stay in your system for a prolonged period of time, making it important to understand the factors that affect its detection and excretion. Regular use of MDMA can increase the detection time of the drug, and individuals who use the drug regularly may experience serious consequences. It is important to exercise caution when using MDMA and to be aware of the potential risks and consequences associated with its use.\nAdditional Tips\nUse in moderation : Use MDMA in moderation to reduce the risk of overdose and addiction.\nStay hydrated : Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and reduce the risk of dehydration and overheating.\nMonitor your health : Monitor your health and seek medical attention if you experience any adverse effects.\nGet help : If you are struggling with MDMA use or addiction, seek help from a healthcare professional or a drug rehabilitation center.",
