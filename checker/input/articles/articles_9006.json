    "text": "A Dutch startup that goes by the name of 'Human Material Loop' is looking to revolutionize the textile world by going about utilizing human hair that would otherwise be discarded from barbershops and salons and re-using it for a variety of applications that range from clothing and carpets to curtains. Founded by none other than the noted designer, researcher and art lecturer Zsofia Kollar, Human Material Loop is essentially a startup that operates in the materials science space with the aim of crafting together high-performance textile and adjacent products that make use of waste human hair. Although companies operating within the wig industry have used longer strands of hair, the fact of the matter is that most hair still gets discarded despite having an array of properties that make it more than useful for upcycled applications, which is precisely what this Dutch startup is pioneering.",

    "text": "Cool roofs are best at beating cities’ heat 4 July 2024 Painting roofs white or covering them with a reflective coating would be more effective at cooling cities like London than vegetation-covered “green roofs,” street-level vegetation or solar panels, finds a new study led by UCL researchers. Conversely, extensive use of air conditioning would warm the outside environment by as much as 1 degree C in London’s dense city centre, the researchers found. The research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, used a three-dimensional urban climate model of Greater London to test the thermal effects of different passive and active urban heat management systems, including painted “cool roofs,” rooftop solar panels, green roofs, ground level tree vegetation and air conditioning during the two hottest days of the summer of 2018, the warmest on record. It found that if adopted widely throughout London, cool roofs could reduce outdoor temperatures across the city on average about 1.2 degrees C, and up to 2 degrees C in some locations. Other systems, such as extensive street-level vegetation or solar panels would provide a smaller net cooling effect, only about 0.3 degrees C on average across London, though they offer other environmental benefits. Similarly, while green roofs offer benefits like water drainage and wildlife habitats, their net cooling effect on the city was found to be negligible on average. Air conditioning, which transfers heat from within buildings to the outside, would warm the outdoor urban environment by about 0.15 degrees C for the city overall, but by as much as 1 degree C in dense central London. The researchers also found that the increase in the distribution of air con units in their model could be entirely powered by photovoltaic solar panels if they were similarly installed to their fullest extent. To gauge the potential full effect of each method, the team modelled each one as though they had been as widely adopted as theoretically feasible across housing, commercial and industrial buildings throughout Greater London. Lead author Dr Oscar Brousse (UCL Bartlett School Environment, Energy & Resources) said: “We comprehensively tested multiple methods that cities like London could use to adapt to and mitigate warming temperatures, and found that cool roofs were the best way to keep temperatures down during extremely hot summer days. Other methods had various important side benefits, but none were able to reduce outdoor urban heat to nearly the same level.” As the climate changes, residents within cities are particularly vulnerable to warming temperatures. Cities generally trap heat, inducing the Urban Heat Island effect that can lead to greater discomfort and mortality for residents during hot spells. Finding ways to adapt or mitigate these warming temperatures has become a high priority for city planners and designers, who have been exploring passive cooling methods like cool roofs, green roofs and expanded urban vegetation as well as active methods for building interiors like air con. The study offered additional insights into urban heat management by comprehensively comparing several common passive and active heat mitigation actions. By reflecting rather than absorbing heat, cool roofs have the dual benefit of not only cooling the outside urban environment but the inside of buildings as well. Though on average the effect of green roofs was negligible, the researchers found that their effect on temperature varied significantly throughout the day. During the warmest times of day, the wide adoption of green roofs could lower urban temperatures by an average of 0.5 degrees C. However, this would be offset overnight as the thermal mass from the roofs would retain daytime heat, releasing when the sun was down and increasing night-time temperatures by about the same amount. Converting city greenspaces from grass to deciduous tree cover would cool temperatures overnight but at best would have mixed net effects during the day. In addition, it would likely increase the amount of water vapour in the air, which would effectively increase the air humidity and could affect residents’ thermal comfort. The research was supported by Wellcome and NERC.

Highland did it from 1997 to 2022.\nSo understandably, Rigby dominated the annual 6A All-Southeastern Conference team with 30 selections alone. This included sweeping all four of the major categories.\nSenior offensive line Feki Pouha was named the Player of the Year. The running back tandem of senior Jerzey Duenes and junior Amani Morel were the Co-Offensive Players of the Year. Senior defensive back Parker Graham, who just signed with Idaho State, was the Defensive Player of the Year. And last, but certainly not least was Armando Gonzalez, who was the Coach of the Year. The Trojans hadn’t won a single state championship prior to his arrival in 2017.\nJunior Owen Golding was a multiple-time first-team selection for them at wide receiver and kick return. Joining him on the first team were junior Jake Flowers (QB), senior Kasyn Thomas (WR), senior Bryson Youngstrom (TE), senior Braiden Byrd (OL), senior Kannon Oswald (OL), senior Dayton Boone (OL), senior Casen Sylvester (DL), senior Gauge Larsen (DL), junior Ethan Hickman (LB), senior Gaige Jones (LB), junior Cannon Korth (DB) and junior Kobe Walker (DB).\nMadison boasted 26 selections, including senior Barkley Beck being both a first-team running back and defensive back.\nAnd Thunder Ridge rounded it all out with 18 picks.

El PSOE y el Gobierno se han sumido este jueves en el más escrupuloso silencio tras el regreso del líder de Junts, limitando las consideraciones a la investidura de Illa y obviando la polémica con el líder independentista, que ha [vuelto a huir](/es/politica/20240808/abogado-puigdemont-asegura-ido-casa-106779702) para evitar ser detenido. En su cuenta de la red social X, García-Page ha comenzado felicitando en primer lugar a Salvador Illa por su [investidura](/es/politica/20240808/salvador-illa-investido-president-generalitat-cataluna-106768531), y ha celebrado que Cataluña pase a tener a \"alguien que se ocupe de los problemas de los catalanes\", a lo que ha añadido que su responsabilidad es \"defender los intereses de Castilla-La Mancha como región de España\". \"Espero que podamos llegar a entendernos\", ha añadido el dirigente castellanomanchego, que en los últimos días se ha mostrado muy crítico con el acuerdo alcanzado por PSC y ERC por el que Cataluña tendrá soberanía fiscal y una agenda tributaria propia. Media docena de barones socialistas han clamado contra la cesión a los independentistas por romper la solidaridad interterritorial, pero hasta el momento sólo García Page se ha referido a Puigdemont después del episodio de este jueves. En un segundo mensaje, el presidente castellanomanchego se ha referido también al ex president, que lleva siete años huido, y después de repudiar que el Gobierno dependa de los siete votos de Junts y calificarlo como \"una profunda vergüenza\", ha enviado un mensaje indirecto al Ejecutivo, que desde el comienzo de la legislatura viene destacando que está apoyado en una \"mayoría progresista\", en la que también incluya al partido posconvegente. \"Espero que ya nadie le incluya cuando se hable de mayoría progresista\", ha reclamado el socialista.

    "text": "The Brief New high-tech buoys in the Hillsborough River are creating tastier and better drinking water for Tampa. The solar-powered buoys kill harmful algae and can stop toxic blooms that can kill fish and wildlife. Deployment of the buoys follows a two-year test run in the river, the main source of Tampa's drinking water. TAMPA, Fla. - When you turn on your spigot in Tampa , water managers said you&apos;ll get tastier, better water thanks to new hi-tech buoys in the Hillsborough River. The solar-powered buoys kill harmful algae and can stop a toxic bloom that can kill fish and wildlife. \"It&apos;s been tested in 50 countries, and it has been so effective that we are going to put it into everyday use,\" said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor at a Wednesday morning press conference. READ: &apos;Kiss of death&apos;: 84% of world&apos;s coral reefs hit by worst bleaching event on record Local perspective: The buoys are deployed in the river beside Tampa&apos;s water treatment plant. They generate ultrasonic waves that travel through the water, out 500 meters. Each buoy is an algae detector. \"It picks up and monitors growth of algae,\" said John Ring of Tampa&apos;s Water Department. Then, using no chemicals, the ultrasonic waves kill the algae. Follow FOX 13 on YouTube \"They sink down, die off, and inhibit a bloom from occurring,\" said Ring. Dig deeper: Deployment of the buoys follows a two-year test run in the river, the main source of Tampa&apos;s drinking water. Officials said the buoys kill algae in a harmless and fast way. \"The longer it&apos;s there, the more opportunity it has to grow toxins,\" said Ed Smith of Florida&apos;s Department of Environmental Protection. Tampa got a state grant to test and implement the buoy system. Each buoy costs around $60,000. The company that manufactures them, LG Sonic, expects to ship two more buoys to Tampa, adding to the two currently in use. MORE: Sen.

Officials said ultrasonic buoys could help prevent it from happening again. \"My hope is we could do just that, prevent blooms from happening in the State of Florida,\" said Smith. What you can do: He cautioned the buoys are part of a multipronged attack on harmful algae. Smith said curbing fertilizer use and changing out septic tanks are also critical for preventing toxic algae blooms. As for the buoys, humans can&apos;t hear the frequencies they emit, and officials said they don&apos;t scare away fish and wildlife. The buoys cost around $60,000 each, but some said they are priceless if Florida&apos;s harmful and smelly algae blooms can be tamed by a buoy.
