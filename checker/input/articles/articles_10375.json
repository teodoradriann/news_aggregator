Só que com uma diferença: todos os gols que marquei tem vídeo. Então, eu posso provar que é (verdade). Todos têm vídeo. Eu respeito todos eles (Pelé, Eusébio e Di Stefano). Todos meus gols tem vídeo”, disse CR7. Cristiano Ronaldo marcou mais um na vitória do Al-Nassr-SAU sobre o Al-Feiha-SAU, na estreia do Campeonato Saudita.

    "title": "Top Stories of 2023: No. 2, Multiple investigations into the District Attorney’s Office",
    "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: The No. 2 story is Multiple investigations into the District Attorney’s Office The 11th Judicial District Attorney’s Office has come under fire this year. There have been multiple requests for an investigation into the DA’s Office submitted to the Office of Attorney Regulation Counsel, a federal lawsuit was filed against the office, several judges recused themselves from a hearing and an allegation was made by a former sitting judge that the DA had an investigator interview his ex-wife about their marriage. Two requests for investigations were submitted to the Colorado Supreme Court’s OARC in late 2022, citing violations of Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct by the DA’s Office. The requests were filed by Douglas County resident Tom Chelston, who was one of the hundreds of citizens who assisted in the search for Suzanne Morphew, who went missing in May 2020 in Chaffee County. He alleges that District Attorney Linda Stanley’s actions during the open case violated the CRPC. “My concerns were further realized when DA Stanley failed to provide formal interviews with actual news organizations while holding online interviews about this murder case with amateur YouTube crime channels,” Chelston’s letter states. While still waiting for a decision by the OARC on the first request for investigation, Chelston wrote to the OARC, expressing concern that other victims may be harmed or their rights compromised as they continued to investigate. He sent information to the OARC regarding an alleged sex assault on a child case that was first reported to law enforcement in 2020 but was not charged until 2022 after it had been reported for a second time by a separate party. Timothy Shane Neely was charged with sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust. Defense Attorney Tyler Jolly in a motion related to a separate case said the Neely case “was dismissed by the District Attorney, at least in part, due to the rampant discovery violations that occurred.” In April, Iris Eytan, the defense attorney for Suzanne Morphew’s husband, Barry Morphew called for Stanley’s disbarment or “the severest sanction possible” against Stanley and six other prosecutors who worked on the Morphew case. Eytan submitted a complaint to the OARC requesting them to fully Investigate and discipline the prosecutors for alleged misconduct and violations of the CRPC. Morphew initially was arrested in connection with his wife’s disappearance. On April 19, 2022, just days before the homicide case was to go to trial in Fremont County, the DA’s Office dismissed all murder and related charges against Morphew, claiming they believed her body was buried under deep snow and they could not access the location before trial. Morphew filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit in May alleging the now-dropped criminal prosecution violated his constitutional rights. He alleges malicious criminal prosecution in his wife’s disappearance. He is suing Chaffee County, the sheriff’s office and board of commissioners, Stanley and members of her staff, as well as Colorado Bureau of Investigation and FBI agents. In April, Thom LeDoux, the attorney representing the woman previously charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury of her child, filed a motion to dismiss her case based on “outrageous government conduct” by Stanley. The motion, filed by LeDoux on behalf of his client, Brook Crawford, 20, claims Stanley’s comments made in an Aug. 1 television interview with KRDO Channel 13 regarding the case were highly prejudicial. Crawford’s son, 10-month-old Edward Hayes, died May 23 after he allegedly was abused by his caregiver, William Jacobs, 21, Crawford’s live-in boyfriend. He has formally been charged with first-degree murder. Crawford’s felony charge of child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury was dismissed in August for lack of probable cause. Her other charges stemming from this case were moved to county court. Fremont County Court Judge Alexandra Robak in October, along with other judges in the 11th JD, however, recused themselves from presiding over a motions hearing for Crawford in November. Patrick Murphy, the Chief Judge of the 11th JD, issued an order Nov. 13 directing the case to the State Court Administrator’s Office to be reassigned. He provided further explanation in his order stating that he was concerned that “if, after hearing, the allegations in the motion proved to be true, the presiding judge might feel compelled to file an ethics complaint against the elected District Attorney, Linda Stanley. This could possibly lead to the recusal of that judge from all cases prosecuted by Mrs. Stanley. Removing a local judge from all criminal cases in a small district for an indefinite period of time would create a vacuum that would be impossible to fill.” In a separate case, the Colorado Supreme Court on Dec. 11 found by a 4-3 vote that the Fremont County District Court did not abuse its discretion by reducing charges from first-degree murder to second-degree murder as a sanction for the DA’s Office for discovery violations in a January 2023 homicide case involving Joseph Tippet. After examining 20 of nearly 30 cases, the Colorado Supreme Court found that there was a pattern of discovery violations on behalf of the DA’s Office, including cases dating back to July 2021. “The 20 cases illustrate, among other things, multiple significant discovery violations by the District Attorney’s Office; explicit warnings from various judges that a pattern of neglect was emerging or had emerged; a lack of understanding by prosecutors regarding their Rule 16 obligations; an apparent lack of oversight by the District Attorney in the face of significant continuing discovery problems; and a pattern by the District Attorney’s Office of dismissing cases when faced with discovery sanctions,” court records state. Since July 2021, five different judicial officers sitting in the 11thJD entered orders finding that the DA’s Office had engaged in a pattern of discovery violations, and imposed deterrent sanctions including bond reductions, exclusion of late-disclosed evidence, exclusion of expert witness testimony, and ultimately, reduction in charges. Those cases include allegations of vehicular eluding, homicide, sexual exploitation of a child, sexual assault and sexual assault against a child. The Supreme Court also found that the DA’s Office had notice of their “pattern of discovery violations”; that the District Court properly sanctioned for deterrence purposes; Tippet suffered prejudice as a result of the discovery delays; and the District Court possessed the authority to reduce charges as a discovery sanction. Similar investigations are making their way through the process, including one filed in May 2022, by Ramsey Lama, a former judge in the 11th JD. While still on the bench, Lama filed a complaint against Stanley with the OARC alleging potential violations of Rules of Professional Responsibility. He alleged Stanley had sent an investigator to interview his ex-wife about their marriage in an attempt to work up a basis to file a motion to recuse. In an “answer to complaint” filed Dec. 18 by Stanley’s attorney, Steven Jensen, Stanley states that the decision to interview Lama’s ex-wife was a team decision and she was “by no means the driving force in pushing for an interview.” Stanley took office in January 2021 and has stated that she will not seek re-election in 2024.

    "text": "En un comunicado, el PJ advirtió que dicho proyecto “profundiza y amplía el inconstitucional decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) 70/2023 que establece una profunda desregulación de la economía, deroga múltiples leyes laborales y allana el camino para la privatización de empresas públicas”.\nDicha formación advierte que las medidas del Gobierno “agravan los problemas de los ciudadanos, al imponer un programa de flexibilización laboral, impositiva y ambiental que ya fue aplicado en otros momentos de la historia y provocó enormes tragedias sociales”.\n“El presidente quiere apropiarse de las facultades del Legislativo, pisoteando la Constitución Nacional y la división de poderes. Asimismo, reduce la representación de las provincias en el Congreso, echando por tierra la paridad de género y la multiplicidad de voces”, apunta el texto.\nSeñala que se pone en venta el patrimonio de todos los argentinos mediante la privatización y la habilitación del Gobierno para endeudarse sin necesidad de consultar a diputados y senadores.\nTambién justifica el despido de miles de trabajadores del sector público, que actualmente sostienen políticas esenciales para garantizar derechos y permite la entrada de tropas extranjeras al país sin la autorización del Congreso, denuncia el PJ.\nPor otra parte, critica la transferencia de los activos del Fondo de Garantía y Sustentabilidad de la Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social al Tesoro Nacional y la eliminación de la fórmula jubilatoria para establecer aumentos discrecionalmente por decreto.\nEl paquete de leyes criminaliza la protesta social, limita el derecho a huelga, agrava las penas a ciudadanos que participen de manifestaciones y establece la posibilidad de detener a quienes organicen reuniones de tres o más personas, advierte el comunicado.\nEstas medidas son un avasallamiento de derechos democráticos que se encuentran estipulados en tratados internacionales e implicaría reinstaurar el estado de sitio en nuestro país. Lejos de representar el orden, esto conllevaría al caos social, asevera.\nEl resultado de la aplicación de las mismas no será distinto al que ya vivimos con recetas que fracasan continuamente y que solo lograrán la destrucción del empleo y de las pequeñas y medianas empresas, la pérdida de la soberanía sobre nuestro territorio y los bienes naturales, concluye. npg/gas",

    "title": "Storm Gerrit: Roofs ripped off homes in tornado and thousands still without power in devastation",
    "text": "A “localised tornado” tore roofs off houses and destroyed walls as Storm Gerrit caused devastation.\nThe Met Office said a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester on Wednesday night and that it had a “strong rotating updraft”, which suggests “a tornado at the surface was likely”.\nAround 100 properties were damaged in Stalybridge, Tameside, and residents in the badly hit village of Carrbrook told of the states of “absolute disaster” houses were in.\nStalybridge resident Kerry Hogan told the BBC it was “bedlam” with trees toppling “like dominoes” while another woman said a tree fell into her bathroom.Ms Hogan told BBC Radio 5 Live the tornado “lasted a minute, 90 seconds, literally a whirlwind of madness” and it “sounded horrendous”.\n“We couldn’t open the front door as the wind was that bad,” she added.\n“Lamp-posts were swaying, we watched trees topple like dominoes.\n“All the neighbours were out, it was bedlam.\n“People have had cars crushed.\n“It was horrific and how nobody has been hurt is unbelievable.”\nEvacuated Carrbrook resident Hayley McCaffer said she was “luckily” at the pub when the tornado struck on Wednesday just before midnight.\n“Some of the neighbours’ houses are an absolute disaster – the roof missing, gable ends gone, cars squished with all the stone that’s come off the houses,” she said.\n“Luckily for us, very luckily, we were in the pub last night when it happened.\n“We weren’t here, but also we had parked our car there and looking at the state of our driveway – one of the walls has come down – we were very lucky that it wasn’t parked there because it would have not been in a good state today.”\nAround 2,900 homes in Scotland remained without electricity on Thursday evening, with around 1,500 expected to be without electricity until Friday, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\nSome ScotRail services were still being cancelled, delayed or revised on Thursday as flooding and road closures caused further travel chaos. Avanti West Coast services departing from London Euston had extended journey times as they are diverted via the Midlands.\nAll Great Western Railway and Elizabeth line services between London Paddington and Reading were blocked after a person was struck by a train. All services were also suspended for a time to and from London Euston due to another person hit by a train.\nFerry services between the Port of Dover and France were operating with delays due to strong winds in the Channel. Passengers were advised to “check-in as normal” and will be transferred “onto the first available sailing on arrival”.\nDamage pictured on the roofs of a row of terraced houses in Stalybridge (REUTERS)\nThe Met Office said the storm had now passed but further unsettled weather was likely later in the week, with strong winds, rain and some upland snow.\nIn Yorkshire three men died after a 4×4 went into a river in an area affected by flooding from the storm.\nNorth Yorkshire Police said they were called to the vehicle in the River Esk near Glaisdale in the North York Moors at 11.48am on Thursday.\nThe vehicle was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm.\nA police spokesperson advised people to travel with care after the “tragic incident”.Police warned that roads around the River Esk are “particularly badly affected”.\nCars became stuck in flood water in two other incidents, in nearby Houlsyke and Hambleton, police said. The occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\nTameside Council said around 100 properties were evacuated when the “mini tornado” hit areas of Carrbrook and Millbrook.\nA spokesperson said: “It is believed everyone affected made arrangements to stay with family and friends overnight.\n“Our officers have been out all night and continue to be out today clearing debris, fallen trees and making roads, footpaths and other areas safe.”\nGreater Manchester Police said officers were called to “numerous reports of significant damage” to homes in Stalybridge, Tameside, at around 11.45pm.\nPhotos and videos posted to social media show several roofs of homes blown off and windows smashed. No injuries were reported but many residents were forced to leave their homes.\nChief Superintendent Mark Dexter from GMP said: “This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.\n“Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers.\n“I would also like to urge members of the public to avoid the area where possible and take extra care when travelling in vehicles on the roads in Stalybridge and the surrounding areas, due to debris in the road.”\nParts of Scotland experienced significant heavy snow with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) saying workers had been dealing with wind speeds of 80mph in some coastal areas as they worked to reconnect customers.\nHigh winds and heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks across Scotland as fallen trees, branches and other debris brought down power lines.\nScottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution said that as of 11am on Thursday supplies had been restored to some 34,000 customers, with around 7,700 left without power.\nAndy Smith, SSEN distribution operations director, said: “Our teams continue to make really good progress in restoring power following the significant impact of Storm Gerrit.\n“Adverse conditions on the roads hampered our efforts last night, but thankfully conditions have improved this morning and we’re making progress with the work that needs to be done.\n“But it will take time to complete all repairs. Some customers in rural areas where there are multiple points of damage, will be without power until Friday.”\nHe said welfare vans providing hot food and drink have been sent to some areas affected, including Grantown, Fort Augustus, Fraserburgh and Banchory.\nScotland Police confirmed the A9 has fully reopened in both directions and is “passable with care” after snow blocked the road between Drumochter and Dalwhinnie.\nCars stuck in flood water in Old Kilpatrick, Scotland (Getty Images)\nInspector Michelle Burns, from Police Scotland’s Road Policing Unit, said: “Conditions for travel in the affected areas may be hazardous and extra caution should be exercised by all road users.\nThe A90 northbound has also reopened after earlier closures, but southbound lanes at Lochlands, Forfar remained off-limits with local diversions in place.\nScotland’s rail network experienced widespread cancellations and delays with a train driver’s cabin hit by a falling tree.\nAslef Scotland confirmed the driver was uninjured and Labour MSP Paul Sweeney said passengers were also unharmed.\nHigh tide in Brighton (Getty Images)\nScotRail suspended multiple train services until further notice, impacting trains travelling while other lines saw their timetables shelved until “a full inspection can be carried out” on the railway network.\nTrain operator LNER, which runs services between London and Scotland on the East Coast Main Line, also advised customers not to travel due to the weather.\nCustomers stranded by the disruption were told to book hotels which they can claim back.\nAvanti West Coast, which operates services on the West Coast Main Line, said its route to Scotland is impassable with all services to and from London terminating at Preston.\nThose with pre-booked tickets for travel between Preston and either Edinburgh or Glasgow can board trains on Thursday or Friday, the operator said.\nMillennium Bridge in London (PA)\nHeathrow Airport cancelled 18 flights on Wednesday due to air traffic control restrictions including routes from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey and Manchester as well as to Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid and Paris.\nA video posted to social media showed a bumpy landing for one American Airlines flight on Wednesday.\nStorm Gerrit also brought plenty of rain gauge at the Great Langdale Valley in the Lake District recording 80mm – nearly half the usual 178mm monthly rainfall for December, the Met Office said.\nThe fastest recorded wind gusts so far are 86mph at Inverbervie on the north-east coast of Scotland, 84mph at Fair Isle and 83mph at Capel Curig, north Wales, the forecaster said.\nRegister now for one of the Evening Standard’s newsletters.

    "text": "Ethereum News Today: Ash Crypto Warns of Ethereum Price Drop Risk Amid Short Unwinding\n- Ash Crypto warns Ethereum may face a price drop due to whale/market maker short unwinding strategies.\n- Analyst highlights risks of leveraged long positions triggering cascading liquidations during volatility.\n- Recommends avoiding leverage, using stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification to mitigate risks.\n- Emphasizes crypto's unpredictable swings and the danger of emotional trading during market uncertainty.\nA prominent crypto analyst known as Ash Crypto has issued a warning about a potential Ethereum price drop, urging traders to exercise caution and avoid the use of leverage in the current market climate [1]. With a following of over 1.8 million on X, Ash Crypto has been closely observing market behavior and identifying patterns that suggest Ethereum (ETH) may be on the verge of a correction. His analysis centers on the actions of large market participants, often referred to as \"whales\" and \"market makers,\" who are currently unwinding their short positions. While this may appear to indicate bullish momentum, Ash Crypto argues that it could be a strategic move aimed at triggering a broader sell-off by liquidating long positions held by retail traders [1].\nAccording to the warning, the unwinding of short positions can serve as a precursor to a more aggressive market move. Ash Crypto notes that when traders act out of fear of missing out (FOMO), they often open leveraged long positions, which can be vulnerable to sudden price swings. A rapid Ethereum price drop could then trigger cascading liquidations, further accelerating the downward trend [1]. This dynamic highlights the precarious nature of leveraged trading during periods of uncertainty, where small price movements can lead to large, uncontrollable losses.\nThe analyst’s message carries particular weight due to his consistent and detailed analysis of market behavior. Unlike traditional financial markets, where price changes are often driven by tangible economic indicators, the crypto market is known for its rapid and unpredictable swings. This volatility, combined with the actions of large players, makes leveraged trading especially risky in the current environment [1].\nAsh Crypto explicitly advises against the use of leverage, emphasizing that it magnifies both gains and losses. In a downturn, leveraged positions are among the first to be liquidated, compounding losses and potentially worsening market sentiment. He outlines several risks associated with leveraged trading, including the potential for total capital loss, forced liquidation by exchanges, and emotionally driven decisions that can lead to poor outcomes [1].\nTo mitigate the risks of a potential ETH correction, Ash Crypto recommends a range of responsible trading practices. These include avoiding high leverage, setting stop-loss orders to limit downside risk, diversifying portfolios across multiple assets, and maintaining a disciplined approach based on research rather than emotional responses to market movements [1]. By prioritizing risk management and staying informed, traders can better navigate the challenges posed by market volatility.\nThe warning serves as a timely reminder that while market predictions cannot be guaranteed, they should not be ignored. Ash Crypto’s analysis is not a definitive forecast but rather an alert to potential market dynamics that traders should be prepared for. The emphasis is on proactive risk management and informed decision-making, particularly as the crypto market continues to evolve and face unpredictable challenges.\n[1] Source: [1] Urgent Ethereum Price Drop Warning: Ash Crypto Advises Against Leverage (https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/689d7c73cd503f0cdaa2257c/)\nComments\nNo comments yet",
