    "text": "La Semana Santa arrancará en Castilla-La Mancha con temperaturas por encima de lo normal para esta época del año. Sin embargo, conforme avancen los días se producirá un cambio brusco, con precipitaciones y un descenso de los termómetros desde el próximo lunes.\nAsí lo ha avanzado este viernes la delegada territorial de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), Eroteida Sánchez , que ha comparecido en rueda de prensa junto a la delegada del Gobierno de España en Castilla-La Mancha, Milagros Tolón , para presentar el informe sobre el invierno meteorológico de la región, el avance para la primavera y la predicción para la Semana Santa.\nSánchez ha indicado que durante el sábado y el domingo continuará la situación de invervalos nubosos, con temperaturas que seguirán siendo agradables -de 23 o 25 grados-, pero el panorama cambiará completamente a partir del lunes . Ese día empezarán a bajar las temperaturas y habrá lluvias generalizadas con alguna tormenta.\n[Aemet confirma las peores previsiones para Semana Santa: los días y zonas en los que lloverá en España]\nSegún ha informado, la temperaturas seguirán bajando el martes, también con precipitaciones generalizadas . Además, aparecerá la nieve en los sistemas montañosos. El miércoles continuarán las lluvias y aparecerán vientos más fuertes.\nPredicción para el jueves, viernes y sábado Para el jueves, viernes y sábado , tal y como ha señalado Sánchez, la península seguirá bajo la influencia de bajas presiones, pero las temperaturas \"se templarán\". Aún así, la delegada territorial de la AEMET ha advertido de que seguirán las precipitaciones , que \"nos podrían estropear las procesiones\".\nNo obstante, ha recordado que \"siempre hay que tener en cuenta la incertidumbre\" y que cuanto más se acercan los días más puede variar la predicción meteorológica.\nLa primavera será cálida Por otro lado, respecto al avance para la primavera, Sánchez ha indicado que hay una \"alta probabilidad\" (60-70 %) de que la temperatura sea superior a la normal en el trimestre de abril, mayo y junio en toda la comunidad.\nEn cuanto al balance del invierno , tanto la delegada de la AEMET como la delegada del Gobierno han indicado que ha sido \"el segundo más cálido desde que se tienen registros\" , con una temperatura media de 7,8 grados.\nCon respecto a las precipitaciones, la media del invierno en la región ha sido de 127 litros por metro cuadrado, lo que se califica como un \"periodo húmedo\" , pero ha habido diferencias entre unas provincias y otras, ya que en Albacete ha sido mucho más seco que en el resto de la comunidad.",

    "text": "Crystal Hefner Says Hugh Hefner Wouldn’t Have Survived #MeToo Movement [Crystal Hefner](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/crystal-harris/) says late husband [Hugh Hefner](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/hugh-hefner/) would “absolutely not” have made it through the [#MeToo movement](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lucy-hale-on-metoo-movement-weve-all-had-our-experiences/). “’I’ve thought about this because #MeToo happened, literally, a month after he passed away,” she told the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13001841/crystal-hefner-hugh-died-just-time-not-survive-metoo-movement.html) on Wednesday, January 24. “He left Earth just in time.” Hugh [died in September 2017](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hugh-hefner-dead-playboy-founder-dies-at-91/) at age 91, just one month before sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein went public and kicked off a movement of women sharing their experiences with sexual violence. (Weinstein, 71, is [currently in prison](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/harvey-weinstein-receives-16-year-sentence-after-rape-conviction/) after being found guilty on charges of rape and assault.) Hugh founded Playboy magazine in 1953. The publication eventually expanded to a complete brand, including the Playboy Bunnies and their residence in the Playboy Mansion. While Hollywood may appear to be all glitz and glam on the surface, the industry has seen its fair share of scandals through the years. The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was […] “I feel that the mansion was so unique and couldn’t be replicated,” Crystal continued. “It was like this weird social experiment at its time, but I don’t know how he would have held up during the #MeToo.” While [various former Playboy Bunnies](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/every-former-playmate-whos-spoken-out-against-hugh-hefner/) — including Crystal — have spoken candidly about their experiences in the mansion, Crystal made it clear that she “never saw [Hef] as, like, a predator.” That being said, she admitted to being “afraid” of having sex with Hugh alone. “He was used to some kind of show, some kind of circus up there,” Crystal told the Daily Mail, referring to his bedroom. “So, like, just me? That’s not enough. It’s easy to feel not enough there.” Crystal met Hugh during a Halloween party hosted at the mansion in 2008 when she was 21. She moved into the Los Angeles home shortly thereafter, and on Christmas Eve in 2010, Hugh gave her a ring as a proposal. They briefly split before ultimately walking down the aisle on New Year’s Eve in 2012. The two were still married when Hugh died five years later. Crystal Hefner didn’t hold back when it came to addressing her decade-long stint as a Playboy Bunny in her new book, Only Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy and Finding Myself. “Life in the mansion wasn’t the fairy tale I had once hoped it would be,” Hefner, 37, wrote in her memoir, which was released on […] On Tuesday, January 23, [Crystal released her memoir](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/crystal-hefner-teases-memoir-about-playboy-mansion-no-one-is-safe/), Only Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy and Finding Myself, which offered a detailed look at her life as a Playboy Bunny. “Life in the mansion wasn’t the fairy tale I had once hoped it would be,” she wrote. “From the outside, sure, it had all the trappings of a fairy tale. But it wasn’t, and everyone who lived there knew it.” When detailing her and Hugh’s marriage, Crystal admitted she was “never in love” with the media mogul. “I loved this old man in the ways you are supposed to love your elders,” she continued. “In the ways you are supposed to love someone who is nearing the end of a long and complicated life.”",

    "text": "OREGON, USA — Oregon health officials are urging parents and caregivers to avoid a recalled baby food after two cases of lead poisoning were detected in the state, according to a statement from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA).\nOHA reported Wednesday that \"two cases of elevated blood lead levels in babies were detected in Oregon\" and that \"during interviews with the families, investigators determined the children consumed the flavor affected by the recall.\"\nThe cases involve Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini and Kale Thyme Vegetable Puree, which were recalled in March by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. OHA said \"the cases followed a recall alert in March of more than 25,000 packages\" of the baby food sold in 4-ounce containers.\nGood & Gather is a Target store brand, and according to the Oregon Health Authority, \"the product was sold nationwide at the company's stores.\" The FDA has classified the recall as a Class II event, which the health authority said \"means that use of or exposure to this product 'may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,' but the probability of serious health impacts is low.\"\nWhile the FDA recall is considered \"terminated,\" OHA warned that \"the product has a best use date of December 2025, so there may be families with the product still in their homes.\"\nOHA's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program Coordinator Ryan Barker, emphasized the particular danger lead poses to young children.\n\"While lead is toxic for all people regardless of age, small children are especially at risk because they're still growing and developing,\" said Barker. \"Continued exposure over time can permanently damage their central nervous system, which may result in long-term health problems, such as learning disorders, impaired speech and brain damage.\"\nOHA noted that lead is of special concern for babies, toddlers and children because even small amounts of lead may affect behavior, cognitive development and academic achievement, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nHealth officials warned that lead poisoning symptoms can be difficult to identify. OHA said \"signs of lead poisoning are not always easy to see and can be mistaken for other illnesses\" and that \"without a blood test, lead poisoning may go undiagnosed, especially since affected children often don't look or act sick.\"\nPossible symptoms according to OHA include:\n- Tiredness or loss of energy\n- Hyperactivity\n- Reduced attention span\n- Irritability or crankiness\n- Poor appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Trouble sleeping\n- Constipation\n- Stomach aches or pains\nThe health authority reported that last year Oregon had 361 lead poisoning cases in children, with 237 affecting children younger than 6. The agency said that while \"the most common cases are due to ingesting paint and paint dust containing lead,\" exposures from \"traditional cosmetics, glazed pottery, and informally imported spices have been identified.\"\nOregon health care providers and laboratories are required by law to report elevated and non-elevated lead test results to local health departments or the Oregon Health Authority.",

Nel video, pubblicato ieri, Verrett ammette che si tratta di un argomento delicato e prosegue dando i suoi consigli da sciamano su come scacciare lo spirito. Le affermazioni hanno suscitato reazioni da parte di diverse persone, tra cui Petter Eide dell'associazione 'Leve', che fornisce supporto ai chi ha tentato di togliersi la vita: \"Sostiene che il suicidio sia causato da uno spirito che si è insediato nel corpo e che possa essere scacciato usando la forza mentale.\" ha affermato Eide al quotidiano norvegese VG. \"Non riesco a esprimere quanto mi sconvolga sentire queste sciocchezze. Sta giocando con la vita delle persone\", ha aggiunto. Secondo l'Istituto di Sanità Norvegese, oltre 600 persone si tolgono la vita ogni anno in Norvegia, un dato significativo per un Paese con una popolazione di 5,5 milioni di abitanti. A confronto, il numero annuale di vittime per incidenti stradali si aggira intorno alle 100 persone. (ANSA).",
