    "title": "No regrets making Fubara governor -Wike",
    "text": "The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, has disclosed that he has no regrets making Siminalayi Fubara the governor of Rivers State.\nWike, who said he and some leaders of the state picked and worked for Fubara’s emergence as the governor noted that the decision was taken to ensure the unity of the state.\nThe minister stated this while speaking at a New Year luncheon he organised in his country home, Rumueprikom, in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the Rivers State on Sunday.\nWike explained that he had to ask those who showed interest, including an ally like the former Rivers PDP Chairman, Felix Obuah, to drop their ambition in order to pave the way for a governor from the riverine area.\nHe disclosed that he invited Obuah, who was a major contender for the governorship election then to his house and asked him to drop his ambition and become the Director-General for the campaign.\nHe revealed how his predecessor as Governor in the state seized Obuah’s property, yet Obuah stood with him.\n“Felix Obuah was in my team as chairman of the party. My predecessor seized Obua’s property, everything he owned, land, schools and hotels. The wife cried to him but he told his wife, ‘don’t worry if it is the will of God there is nothing you can do. He stood firm. They took everything he had.\n“He was one of the frontrunners in the 2023 governorship election. I told him in my house to step down so that he wouldn’t run. He looked at me but I said you won’t run. He said if that was what I am saying he won’t run. But I say you will be DG, go and campaign for that election.\n“I say you must be DG and he said if that is what you want I will go and do it. And he did it. I see all kinds of things going on. They are talking evil about him. But he is here and he will still be here,” Wike stated.\nContinuing, he said, “Those, who open their mouths to talk don’t know anything. I was the one who paid for the forms for anybody who wanted to run for elections as governor, House of Assembly and National Assembly. Let one person raise his hand and say he bought forms.\n“We say we are all family members with no need for acrimony. Don’t spend your money, we will agree on who will run. The day we made the final decision, the Chairman of the elders’ council nearly collapsed.\n“He is here. OCJ Okocha was there, Awuse was there. Omehia was there. He nearly collapsed. Why? He wanted a governor from the riverine area.\n“When I looked at him, I said, ‘Why will I allow this old man to just die.’ I say let’s not create the impression that there are people who want to monopolise power.\n“Let’s allow everybody to be part of it because we belong to one Rivers State. If I had wanted, nobody would have stopped me. Nobody had what it takes to even be near me.\n“And to God be the glory, I don’t regret what I did and I will never regret what I did because I want the unity of this state for us to forge ahead. If I wanted an Ikwerre man, nobody would have stopped me”.\nHe added that his concern is to play politics of unity of Rivers, saying when he visited the National Vice Chairman of the APC, South-South, Chief Victor Giadom, he went there with PDP leaders.\nHe said, “Today he (Giadom) is here with all APC leaders. Membership of the party is not on Radio or Television. So, all of us must make Rivers State to move forward.\n“Let’s move forward for the interest of the state. That is important. I took the decision and you listened to me. I want you to also listen to me now. Let’s accept what Mr. President has said. It is for the interest of Rivers and for Nigeria in general.\n“It may not be the best but there is no option. Mr. President took a lot of risk to give me the position of Minister of FCT. People protested but he stood firm. If he could do that, you too should accept his decision.\n“When we came back from Abuja, within the next 48 hours, the speaker and his people took the decision to obey Mr. President without attaching any condition. I thank Mr. Speaker and other members for respecting Mr. President.\n“Whether you are APC or PDP or you don’t belong to any of the parties, we owe a duty to give Mr. President support to move this country forward. Some people said I betrayed PDP, but I never betrayed PDP. We stood firm and told Nigerians we wouldn’t do this if this was not done. So the issue of betrayal doesn’t arise”.\nWike said he learnt from President Tinubu, who once taught him that betrayal and politics are mother and father, just as he recalled how the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, allegedly betrayed all the agreements they had to pave the way for his second term.\nHe added, “It is not everything you invest that you will reap. Even established companies crumble. You cannot say I did this but I am not benefitting. God knows why it happens the way it happens.\n“What is important in life is to give God the glory that you are alive to see what is happening. When a man is dead, he doesn’t know what is happening.\n“You will be able to advise your children and your friends. When the heat was on in Edo, this young man was a frontrunner in the Edo Governorship election.\n“PDP leaders came to me in Port Harcourt from 6 pm to 6 am the next day. I told the young man with Dan Orbih to withdraw and not to run for the governorship. He was crying and we agreed on what would be given to their group.”\nWike stated further, “He was to be refunded the money he spent and to get four commissioners but not one was kept. We said okay you would run for Senate in the next election. But not one was kept.\n“But the next thing was blackmail that Wike wants to control this. But you didn’t know what Wike wanted to control when you came and held a meeting with me from 6 pm to 6 am. It was all about blackmail. That is what you see in politics.\n“You must have shock absorbers. President Tinubu told me when we were meeting that politics and betrayal are the same mother and father. If you don’t want to be betrayed, don’t enter politics.\n“So prepare yourself that it will happen. I am fully prepared because I know it is one of the things President Tinubu taught me. I am laying this foundation so that some of you who are worried should not be. That is life for you. You must prepare yourself to know that these things happen. I have preached and continue to preach for unity and for peace in this state”.\nThe minister declared that he is committed to implementing the peace agreement brokered by Tinubu in the political crisis in the state.\nWike, also called on parties to endeavour to implement the same without conditions.\nWhile commending the State House of Assembly for implementing its side of the resolutions, the former governor vowed that he would never disobey President Tinubu.\nWike stated, “I want to make one confession to you. I work with Mr. President and there is no way I can disobey Mr. President. It is not possible. The mere fact that Mr. President calls you and said look allow peace here, there is no way I can disobey Mr. President.\n“I may not be happy with all resolutions but if Mr. President calls for peace, who are you to say you don’t want peace? I will not attach any condition to what Mr. The President wants from me. I will not do it.\n“So, I must obey Mr. President. I must do everything humanly possible to see that the peace arrangement is achieved in Rivers. That is what is required and I am going to do that.”\nSpeaking on the Rivers crisis he said, “Ask people why this matter came to this level. When people went and plotted the removal of the Speaker you think we would fold our hands to remove the Speaker?\n“We will start with you first. Do you want to humiliate us by removing the Speaker? They said I should go and talk to the assemblymen and I said why? They said you brought them. But I said so these ones will listen to me but you you won’t listen.\n“They said chairmen of councils don’t respect anybody. But I said why won’t they respect anybody? People are plotting evil and nobody wants to talk.\n“We must make an impact on people’s lives. Whatever position that you find yourself in, make an impact. Forget about these people who cannot face me to fight me. I consumed them before and I will continue to consume them. Show them the way. Follow a man that knows the way.”",

    "text": "Israel promete lutar “até a vitória” no Líbano Vários países fizeram um apelo conjunto por um cessar-fogo de 21 dias, rejeitado pelo primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu publicidade Israel prometeu, nesta quinta-feira (26), que continuará lutando contra o movimento islamista Hezbollah no Líbano “até a vitória” e rejeitou um pedido conjunto de um cessar-fogo de 21 dias feito por Estados Unidos, União Europeia e vários países árabes. Pelo quarto dia consecutivo, Israel efetuou uma série de bombardeios contra redutos do Hezbollah no Líbano, enquanto o grupo apoiado pelo Irã disparou mais uma vez projéteis contra complexos militares israelenses. Israel indicou que matou o chefe da unidade de drones do Hezbollah, Mohamed Srur, em \"bombardeios de precisão” no subúrbio sul de Beirute. Uma fonte da milícia pró-iraniana já havia informado anteriormente que esse comandante foi o alvo de um ataque na região, que, segundo o Ministério da Saúde libanês, deixou dois mortos e 15 feridos. O Exército israelense indicou que os seus aviões atacaram nesta quinta 75 alvos do Hezbollah no sul e leste do Líbano, e afirmou à noite que realizava novos bombardeios contra o movimento islamista. Vinte pessoas, quase todas de nacionalidade síria, morreram na localidade de Yunin, no leste do país, informou o Ministério da Saúde libanês. O Exército israelense também informou que dezenas de \"projéteis” foram lançados do Líbano. O Hezbollah disse que disparou uma centena de foguetes contra as cidades de Safed e Haifa, no norte de Israel. \"Uma chance à diplomacia” Os bombardeios israelenses mataram mais de 600 pessoas desde segunda-feira, incluindo muitos civis, e forçaram 90 mil a fugir das suas casas no Líbano, segundo a ONU. Entre elas, mais de 31 mil entraram na Síria, de acordo com as autoridades libanesas. Hasan Slim, um libanês de 24 anos, partiu com a mãe em busca de refúgio na Síria, um país destruído por anos de guerra civil. \"Evitávamos a Síria por causa da guerra, mas agora a guerra está batendo na nossa porta”, explicou. Desde que começou a guerra na Faixa de Gaza entre Israel e o movimento palestino Hamas, em 7 de outubro de 2023, pelo menos 1.540 pessoas morreram no Líbano devido aos bombardeios israelenses, no contexto dos confrontos transfronteiriços com o Hezbollah, aliado do Hamas. Os duelos de artilharia se intensificaram depois das detonações mortais dos dispositivos de comunicação de membros do movimento libanês, atribuídos a Israel, em 17 e 18 de setembro, e de um bombardeio israelense em 20 de setembro em um subúrbio do sul de Beirute, que decapitou a unidade de elite Radwan do grupo pró-iraniano. Diante da escalada que ameaça arrastar toda a região para a guerra, Estados Unidos, França e outros aliados, incluindo os países árabes, fizeram um apelo conjunto a um cessar-fogo de 21 dias, a fim de \"dar uma chance à diplomacia”, diz um comunicado divulgado pela Casa Branca. Mas o primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejeitou energicamente o apelo e ordenou às tropas que continuassem a combater o Hezbollah \"com toda a força necessária”. O gabinete do premiê israelense indicou que Netanyahu “sequer respondeu” ao pedido de um cessar-fogo, embora a Casa Branca afirme que o apelo foi “coordenado com a parte israelense”. Seus ministros da Segurança Nacional e das Finanças, Itamar Ben Gvir e Bezalel Smotrich (extrema direita), respectivamente, também rejeitaram a ideia de um cessar-fogo no Líbano, com o primeiro ameaçando boicotar as atividades do governo caso isso ocorra. Israel anunciou em meados de setembro que o \"centro de gravidade” da guerra contra o Hamas estava se deslocando para a fronteira com o Líbano. O objetivo, segundo afirmou, é garantir o retorno de dezenas de milhares de habitantes do norte, deslocados pelas hostilidades com o Hezbollah, às suas casas. Guerra total “devastadora\" O secretário de Defesa dos Estados Unidos, Lloyd Austin, advertiu que “uma guerra total seria devastadora para Israel e Líbano” e disse que um cessar-fogo no Líbano poderia contribuir para alcançar um acordo de trégua em Gaza. O Hezbollah prometeu continuar combatendo Israel “até o fim da agressão em Gaza”. O comandante do Estado-Maior do Exército israelense, Herzi Halevi, pediu na quarta-feira a seus soldados que se preparassem para uma \"possível” ofensiva terrestre no Líbano. O Ministério da Defesa israelense, Yoav Gallant, anunciou nesta quinta que recebeu um novo pacote de ajuda militar dos Estados Unidos, no valor de 8,7 bilhões de dólares (47,32 bilhões de reais), “em apoio ao esforço militar” do país. Apesar do agravamento dos confrontos com o Hezbollah, Israel continua sua ofensiva em Gaza, onde a Defesa Civil informou que 15 pessoas morreram no bombardeio de uma escola que abrigava deslocados no campo de Jabaliya, no norte. Este conflito eclodiu com o ataque do Hamas em 7 de outubro, que deixou 1.205 mortos em Israel, a maioria civis, segundo uma contagem da AFP baseada em números oficiais israelenses que inclui reféns que morreram no cativeiro em Gaza. Das 251 pessoas raptadas, 97 permanecem em Gaza, 33 das quais foram declaradas mortas pelo Exército. Em retaliação, Israel lançou uma ofensiva na Faixa de Gaza que já deixou 41.534 mortos, a maioria civis, segundo dados do Ministério da Saúde do governo do Hamas, considerados confiáveis pela ONU.",

    "text": "Over 38 million people live with diabetes, and underserved communities experience a disproportionate impact. Over half of Americans risk facing at least one social barrier that affects their health, and knowing these obstacles can help clinicians better address diabetes. Employers can use health data to offer personalized support for employees with type 2 diabetes. If you don't have diabetes, chances are you know someone who does. In the US alone, more than 38 million people have diabetes – about one in 10 – and the vast majority are cases of type 2 diabetes. Another 98 million have prediabetes. Undiagnosed cases likely push these figures even higher.\n\"It's a growing epidemic,\" said Dr. Donna O'Shea, chief medical officer of population health, UnitedHealthcare. \"We've seen higher and higher rates of diagnosis despite many calls to action and significant efforts from public health officials and doctors.\"\nDiabetes isn't just widespread. It's also expensive. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) reports that medical costs related to diabetes have risen 35% in the last decade. The medical expenses of people with diabetes are 2.6 times higher than those of people without it, with the ripple effects hitting employers hard — especially those that self-fund employee health benefits.\nBeyond treatment costs, diabetes also takes a toll on workforce productivity. Missed work days due to diabetes cost US employers over $106 billion annually, adding to the urgency for employers to more effectively manage the condition within their workforce.\nMany employers are now leveraging health data to develop a deeper understanding of how diabetes affects their employees. This data-driven approach allows employers to offer customized support for those who are at greatest risk.\nFast facts:\nMedical costs to treat diabetes have increased more than 35% in the last decade. Diabetes also takes a toll on workforce productivity, costing US employers over $106 billion annually due to missed work days. Men over 50 in lower-income groups have the highest diabetes prevalence. What the data reveals about diabetes and underserved communities The factors contributing to developing type 2 diabetes vary significantly based on geography and demographics. A 2021 white paper from UnitedHealthcare and the Health Action Council (HAC), which analyzed health care claims from 280,000 adults with employer-sponsored health insurance, found that men over 50 in lower-income groups have the highest diabetes prevalence. Meanwhile, those of Asian ethnicity have a 43% higher risk of diabetes, largely due to genetics and diet. \n\"Diabetes takes a well-documented toll on underserved communities, as well as areas of the country where access to clinical resources is limited,\" said Craig Kurtzweil, chief data and analytics officer at UnitedHealthcare's commercial business.\nDisparities across certain groups are largely due to social drivers of health (SDoH) — non-clinical factors like access to health care, nutritious food and safe living conditions. SDoH can influence about 80% of an individual's health outcomes. And they don't just affect people living in poverty; a different study from the HAC and UnitedHealth Group found that 52% of adults face at least one SDoH risk, with 16% encountering two or more.\nThe white paper represented the first time a health insurance company used its data to analyze SDoH risks among people with employer-sponsored health insurance.\nEmployers must also recognize that these factors vary across regions. Health challenges faced by workers at a financial firm in New York City may differ significantly from those at an agricultural company in rural America. Even employees working for the same employer but living in different states may experience vastly different health outcomes. The UnitedHealthcare-HAC white paper found that some employees had a 55% higher likelihood of dying before age 75, depending on their location.\nThese stark differences emphasize the crucial role of data in helping employers support the health of their workforce. National insurers, like UnitedHealthcare, serving employer customers and members across multiple states have access to massive amounts of de-identified health data that can reveal patterns and disparities in employee health. When provided to employers in actionable ways, this data becomes an extraordinarily powerful tool for designing targeted interventions.\n\"With our data sets, UnitedHealthcare is positioned to help employers understand down to a subpopulation level exactly where the pockets of SDoH barriers exist. That leads to more targeted, precise and customized interventions for diabetes care, and in turn, healthier, more productive employees and lower health care costs,\" Kurtzweil said.\nA personalized approach to diabetes management One of those interventions is Level2 ®, a value-based care solution from UnitedHealthcare to help members with type 2 diabetes work to improve control of their blood sugar.\nMembers who are eligible for Level2 receive a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as well as personalized support from a care team, both of which help to educate and influence members to make healthier lifestyle choices.\nThe powerful combination of the CGM and support from a care team can help members understand how daily choices, such as food, exercise and sleep patterns, affect their blood sugar. With this information, patients can be encouraged to make small but impactful changes.\nIn a study recently showcased at the 2024 ADA Scientific Sessions, 73% of UnitedHealthcare members enrolled in Level2 had a clinically meaningful improvement in their hemoglobin A1C measurement, demonstrating that Level2 may lead to sustained lower glucose levels.\nFor employers, the approach can help reduce overall care costs by improving employee health outcomes and avoiding costly complications, like heart disease or nerve damage, which can stem from untreated diabetes.\nAnd if the value generated from the program is less than an employer's paid program fees, the Level2 Assured Value Program gives eligible employers back the difference .\n\"Level2 combines evidence-based interventions with real-time feedback from a CGM to help employees overcome the most common barriers to managing their diabetes and overall health, especially those from traditionally underserved populations,\" O'Shea said.\n\"Employers want predictability in what it will cost to treat type 2 diabetes,\" she added. \"This is one way we are helping to support them.\"\nLearn more about Level2's role in supporting safe and effective diabetes care.\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with UnitedHealthcare.",

    "text": "[Home](https://www.greenmatters.com/)> [Big Impact](https://www.greenmatters.com/big-impact)> [News](https://www.greenmatters.com/news) Video Reveals Dressage Olympian Whipping Horse's Legs, Unveiling Cruelty in the Sport Dujardin has now been suspended by the FEI. [Lauren Wellbank](https://www.greenmatters.com/a/lauren-wellbank) Published Jul. 25 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET The [2024 Paris Olympics](https://www.greenmatters.com/big-impact/paris-olympics-medals-eiffel-tower) is making headlines for all the [wrong reasons](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/olympics-environmental-impact), after news broke that one of Great Britain's Olympic members had withdrawn from the competition. Charlotte Dujardin has dropped out of Olympics after a video of her [beating a horse](https://www.greenmatters.com/pets/ashley-holzer-dressage-controversy) was leaked to the public. The three-time gold medalist has since apologized for her actions, but it doesn't seem like the mea culpa is enough to sway public opinion or that of her peers. Here's everything you need to know about the video that has put Dujardin's highly decorated career in jeopardy, including what this means for the future of dressage — plus, a look into whether dressage is cruel to horses. A has video emerged of dressage equestrian Charlotte Dujardin beating her horse. Animal lovers and casual fans alike were horrified after a video from several years ago was [released by a whistleblower](https://www.bbc.com/sport/equestrian/articles/cw0y240r78qo), who captured Dujardin's heinous acts on her camera. In the clip, Dujardin can be seen using a long whip to beat the horse that was being ridden by one of her students in an attempt to get the animal to raise their hoofs more during a canter. The horse was hit more than 24 times in a single minute, according to the attorney representing the whistleblower, [Stephan Wensing.](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/23/profile-charlotte-dujardin-rides-into-storm-after-decorated-olympic-career) Per The Guardian, [Wensing said that](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/23/deeply-ashamed-gb-dressage-star-charlotte-dujardin-pulls-out-of-olympics-over-coaching-video) his unnamed 19-year-old client decided that it was time to release the old footage after seeing how many other trainers were being suspended over claims of abuse. For instance, there's the infamous [case of Cesar Parra,](https://www.peta.org/blog/olympic-dressage-rider-cesar-parra/) who was suspended from dressage as a result of a viral video that surfaced in February 2024. Dujardin released a statement after the video dropped, saying that the incident was completely out of character for her, adding that it “does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.\" Watch the video of Dujardin whipping the horse below — but be warned, some viewers may find it upsetting. Charlotte Dujardin will no longer compete in the 2024 Olympics. The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) was alerted to the video by Wensing, who he says took the matter \"very seriously.\" But, before the FEI could make a formal ruling in response to the clip, Dujardin decided to pull herself from the Olympics on her own. According to her statement, her decision was not an attempt to avoid the investigation, but instead to remove herself from the spotlight until the FEI has finished their inquest and come to a decision. “We are deeply disappointed with this case, especially as we approach the Olympic Games in Paris 2024,” Ingmar De Vos, FEI President, said via a statement. “However, it is our responsibility and crucial that we address any [instances of abuse](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/kentucky-derby-horse-abuse), as equine welfare cannot be compromised.” Is dressage cruel to horses? For those who never heard the term dressage before this incident, it's a type of specialized horse riding, which features horses that have learned to perform through extreme measures. In fact, according to Vice, this style of training was developed back when horses were ridden into [physical battle](https://www.vice.com/en/article/mg75jx/why-is-dressage-still-an-olympic-sport-equestrian) to teach them to go against their instincts and gallop into harm's way. In order to achieve that degree of training, horses have to be taught how to submit to their trainers. As for how they get them to submit, well, many call it abuse. Allegations of [animal cruelty](https://www.greenmatters.com/community/ian-mckeever-horse) have plagued the sport of dressage, including claims against other trainers and riders which have made headlines even outside the world of equestrian sports, raising concerns about the future of dressage. For now, it seems like the incident with Dujardin will at the very least highlight some of the changes that need to be made when it comes to using animals for sport.",

    "text": "下载新浪财经APP，了解全球实时汇率\n财联社6月12日讯（编辑 马兰） 英国海上贸易运营局（UKMTO）周三向在阿拉伯湾、阿曼湾和霍尔木兹海峡作业的海员发出警告，称地区紧张局势加剧可能会影响商业航运。\n英国海上贸易运营局隶属于英国皇家海军海上贸易信息中心，在协调高风险海域商船与军队之间的通信方面发挥着核心作用。\n而霍尔木兹海峡是波斯湾和阿拉伯海之间的战略要地，近年来一直是地缘政治摩擦的焦点。但其又是世界上许多石油和包括谷物在内的关键大宗商品都要经过的海上航线。\n海事风险管理领军企业Diaplous集团指出，人们担心美国和伊朗之间正在进行的核谈判可能在周四破裂。\n据多家媒体此前报道，出于安全考虑，美国政府已建议其驻中东大使馆的非必要工作人员和军事基地人员家属离开中东，以防可能发生敌对行动。\n担忧升级\n此前，美国曾威胁称，如果伊朗核谈判失败，其将采取军事行动。美国总统特朗普也表示，不会允许伊朗拥有核武器。\n而伊朗则在周三表示，如果发生冲突，它可能袭击该地区的美国基地。英国海上安全公司Ambrey因此警告，与美国或以色列相关的商船可能面临更高级别的反制行动的风险。\n航运业和保险业消息人士透露，若美国大力支持以色列的进攻行动，其将增加美国航运和载有美国货物的船只的风险。人们越来越担心以色列或伊朗的任何行动产生溢出效应，尤其是在海湾地区及附近海域。\n航运协会波罗的海国际航运公会（BIMCO）首席安全与安保官Jakob Larsen进一步指出，任何袭击都有可能升级局势，影响航运，并牵连到包括美国在内的在该地区活动的其他国家的军事力量。\n他补充称，如果以色列、美国和伊朗之间爆发全面武装冲突，那肯定会在短期内导致霍尔木兹海峡被封锁，并推高油价。",
