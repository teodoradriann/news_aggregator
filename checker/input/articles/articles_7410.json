    "text": "IBX light rail gets a shot in the arm, despite MTA’s about-face on tolls\nGov. Hochul’s recent desire to “pause” congestion pricing put a shadow on many planned improvements in the MTA’s subway, bus and commuter rail system that were expected to be funded by the new toll program.\nAmong these was the planned Interborough Express or IBX: a light rail line that would travel, within the Long Island Rail Road and Bay Ridge Freight Line’s right-of-way, from Bay Ridge to Borough Park to Flatbush to East Flatbush to East New York and, from there, into Queens.\nTransit advocates’ hopes were dashed Wednesday when the MTA board voted 10-1 to second Gov. Hochul’s slamming the brakes on congestion pricing. However, there was also a bright side. The federal Department of Transportation announced $44.7 billion in grants for three projects in New York — one of which was the IBX.\nSome $15 million in Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants would go toward preparing a planning assessment for the transit link, according to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The official announcement says the IBX “will shift travelers from higher-risk modes of travel and make street-level improvements that will further improve safety for everyone.”\nThe IBX, variations of which had been on the drawing board for years, was made an official state project by Hochul in 2022. Its route would connect to as many as 17 subway lines and 52 bus routes, the MTA says. IBX service would be designed to coexist with rail freight.\nAlso, part of the RAISE grants is $5,664,000 to support planning activities for the Urban Freight Mobility Collaborative. The goal of the collaborative, according to the feds, is “to encourage the replacement of freight vehicles with cargo bikes, waterborne freight and cleaner alternative fuel vehicles,” as well as to identify locations for electric vehicle charging stations, cargo bicycle parking and more.\nAlthough Brooklyn wasn’t specifically mentioned in connection with the Urban Freight Mobility Collaborative, the borough’s waterfront neighborhoods would certainly be a focus of this effort. Red Hook residents and officials, for example, have often complained about the number of warehouses in the area, the resulting traffic jams and the lack of adequate roads to handle traffic coming in or out of the Red Hook Cruise Terminal.\nThe MTA board’s vote may not come as a surprise to many people since the members are appointed by the governor, with some input from New York City and the surrounding counties.\nBefore the board voted, the line of people wishing to make comments stretched around the block outside the agency’s Lower Manhattan headquarters. Many of these people strongly defended congestion pricing — and many were from Brooklyn.\nBrooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso slammed the board members — most of whom had originally voted for congestion pricing — for caving into the governor. “Why even have an MTA board if the decisions are made only on political whims?” he asked. “The board has consistently been disrespected and thrown to the wolves anytime a governor wants to make a political decision.\n“As a result, we have one of the least-funded systems in the United States. There must be some board members who have some ego, some pride,” he said.\nIn an outdoor protest rally before the vote, Assemblymember Robert Carroll (D. Park Slope, Kensington, Windsor Terrace, Prospect Heights) urged the board members to “take their fiduciary responsibility and have the courage of their convictions.” He reminded those present that congestion pricing was passed by the Assembly and the State Senate five years ago and said one person — the governor — shouldn’t have the ability to “tear it up.”",

    "text": "¡Orgullo duranguense! Eunice Ramírez conquista oro en Cross Country y plata en Short Track\nRICARDO HERNANDEZ\nLa ciclista duranguense Eunice Idali Ramírez Gurrola vivió un fin de semana inolvidable en el Campeonato Nacional de Ciclismo de Montaña 2025. En Toluca, conquistó el primer lugar en la modalidad Cross Country (XCO) y sumó un segundo puesto en Short Track (XCC), dentro de la categoría Femenil 30’s, reafirmando su lugar entre las competidoras más fuertes del país.\nEl evento se llevó a cabo los días 19 y 20 de julio en la pista 'La Placa', ubicada en el parque ecológico Cacaloman, situado a más de 3,400 metros de altitud. El circuito fue un verdadero reto físico, no solo por la exigencia de sus subidas prolongadas, sino también por la velocidad que demandaron sus descensos, y aunque el terreno estaba limpio y sin obstáculos, la altitud castigó a muchas competidoras, que sufrieron fatiga desde las primeras vueltas.\nTambién te puede interesar: Isaac Del Toro suma un logro más en Europa\nEstrategia, dureza y talento puro\nEunice afrontó ambas pruebas con un formato de clasificación directa, lo que significa que no participó en fechas previas y todo se definió en una sola jornada. Lejos de ser un obstáculo, esta situación la impulsó a darlo todo desde el arranque, confiando en la preparación previa que había hecho para enfrentar este tipo de circuitos.\nSu estrategia fue clara, dosificando fuerzas y manteniendo un ritmo estable, sin arriesgar en exceso en los primeros tramos, lo cual, aunado al reconocimiento previo de la pista, le permitió calcular cada esfuerzo, sabiendo en qué momento atacar y en qué punto reservar energía. Esa regularidad fue clave para dominar el Cross Country, donde lideró con autoridad y dejó sin respuesta a sus rivales.\nExposición a nivel nacional\nEn el Short Track, el desgaste ya acumulado hizo la competencia más cerrada, pero la duranguense mostró carácter para mantenerse entre las primeras posiciones. Con inteligencia, gestionó los tramos más rápidos y defendió su lugar en el podio, logrando un segundo puesto que sabe a triunfo, considerando las condiciones extremas en las que se corrió.\nEstos resultados fueron registrados oficialmente por la organización del Campeonato Nacional, lo que coloca a Eunice Idali Ramírez como una de las grandes protagonistas de la categoría Femenil 30’s. Más allá de las medallas, su actuación en Toluca refuerza el prestigio que Eunice ha acumulado con el pasar del tiempo, situándose como una de las competidoras más destacadas en su categoría a nivel nacional.\nTambién te puede interesar: Celebran la Primera Copa Durango",

    "title": "MEMBERSHIP MINGLING: Chamber members say CEO inspired them to be more active | News | tahlequahdailypress.com",
    "text": "Long-standing members of the Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce say they’ve been inspired to become more active since the new CEO and president took the helm. Each month, the Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce hosts the Monthly Mingle at a different business in town, and this month’s event was held at Peak Health and Performance on Jan. 5. The purpose of the Mingles is to allow networking among area businesses and for residents to attend and meet local merchants. A buffet of juice, coffee and breakfast sandwich was served. Ward 2 City Councilor Keith Baker and William Morgan of Elephant Rock Garden Supply, emceed the event. Elephant Rock is the presenting sponsor for all of the Mingles in this fiscal year. Superintendent of Tahlequah Public Schools Tanya Jones said attends these functions because TPS has been a member of the Chamber for several decades. Lacie Wilson, principal of Tahlequah High School, also attended to show support for the Chamber. “I think TPS has been a member of the Chamber for a long time, but they were never active. We are a $46 million business in this city, that’s our budget,” Jones said. “People don’t think of school in those terms. And these people are what make our schools work so we have to make our school work for the community because if we don’t have good schools, businesses aren’t going to want to come here.” The superintendent said TPS’ relationship with the Chamber is excellent. “And since Nathan Reed has taken over as executive director, he has sought the schools out from the beginning of his work with the Chamber and has forged a connection that we’ve just run with, and it’s terrific,” Jones said. Reed, CEO and president of the Chamber, concurred with Jones’ comments and said that has been the position of the chambers of commerce with which he has been associated in the past. “In Siloam Springs, we had a very close partnership with the school district, and I was honestly shocked that they didn’t have one when I came here,” Reed said. “It was when Leon Ashlock was superintendent. One of my first meetings when I came here was with him, to find out how we can support the school district.” Reed said that since TPS has minimal bonding capacity, it is beneficial for TPS to have relationships with businesses for donations and partnerships. “But it’s also beneficial for the Chamber as well, because we want people to live here, stay here, and if we don’t have a strong educational system – that’s the No. 1 [concern] with a family. So if we can help facilitate those relationships with TPS and the business community, that’s beneficial to the Chamber when we are recruiting businesses to come to Tahlequah. A strong education is the backbone of a community,” Reed said. Chance and Jade Adams own Peak Health and Performance and have been members of the Chamber since opening in December 2023. “I think it’s important as a local business to join the Chamber because of the value you get out of it – the local Mingles, the relationships,” Chance said. Jade pointed out an attendee and bragged on the woman’s progress she has made since becoming a client for the personal training services. “She’s lost 22 pounds and 22 inches,” Jade said. Marsha Crosslin with the Cherokee County Assessor’s Office attends the Monthly Mingles to connect personally with local business owners. “We are seen as the bad guys because we raise property taxes. So we try and come out and smooth the way,” Crosslin said. Jeremy Jones, branch manager for the Tahlequah Public Library, attends the Chamber’s events to exchange ideas with other members on how the library can continue to expand efforts to help the community. “[I’m] just mingling, making connections, trying to see how we can help serve everybody,” he said. What’s next The next Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce Monthly Mingle is Feb. 2, 8 a.m., at BancFirst.",
