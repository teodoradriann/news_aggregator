    "title": "Report: Former NFL QB Byron Leftwich joining CU Buffs' coaching staff",
    "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff at Colorado.\nJordan Schultz of Fox reported Wednesday that Leftwich is the latest addition to the star-studded staff hired by Buffs’ head coach Deion Sanders. CU has not confirmed the hire, but Schultz is represented by SMAC Entertainment, which also represents Sanders.\nEarlier this week, Sanders told media: “We have a couple more huge moves we’ll probably make this week, maybe one next week that you’re going to really appreciate the understanding of how wonderful the staff is.”\nIt’s unclear what Leftwich’s role will be with the Buffs, but he has been on campus this spring.\nLeftwich, 45, played for 10 seasons in the NFL before embarking on a coaching career. He most recently was the offensive coordinator for the NFL’s Tampa Buccaneers from 2019-22, working for three years with future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady.\nAlthough he hasn’t coached since 2022, Leftwich interviewed in January for the head coaching position with the New England Patriots. He also interviewed this offseason for the offensive coordinator job with the Seattle Seahawks.\nA close friend of Sanders, Leftwich has been around the CU program a bit during Sanders’ previous two seasons. He has visited Boulder and Folsom Field to see the Buffs play.\nAs a player, Leftwich was a star at Marshall from 1998-2002, throwing for 11,903 yards, most of that in his final three years as a starter for the Thundering Herd. He was a two-time MAC offensive player of the year.\nThe seventh overall selection in the 2003 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, Leftwich played four seasons for them before moving on. He also played with the Atlanta Falcons (2007), Pittsburgh Steelers (2008, 2010-12) and Buccaneers (2009).\nLeftwich was 24-26 as a starter in the NFL, throwing for 10,532 yards in his career. He was a backup for Pittsburgh when it won Super Bowl XLIII.\nIn 2016, Leftwich began his coaching career as an intern with the Arizona Cardinals. He spent three seasons in Arizona before becoming the offensive coordinator at Tampa Bay in 2019.\nBrady signed with the Bucs in 2020, teaming with Leftwich to lead them to a victory in Super Bowl LV.\nThe NFL’s all-time leader in career touchdown passes, with 649, Brady had three 40-touchdown seasons in his 23-year career – two of those with Leftwich as his coordinator. Brady threw 40 touchdown passes in 2020 and a league-high 43 in 2021.\nLeftwich is the latest in a long line of former NFL players and coaches that are now on the staff in Boulder, headlined by Sanders, a Pro Football Hall of Famer.\nDefensive assistant Warren Sapp (hired last year) and running backs coach Marshall Faulk (hired this winter) are also Hall of Famers.\nFormer NFL players Domata Peko (defensive line coach), Andre Gurode (offensive line) and George Hegamin (offensive line) have also been hired this offseason.\nThird-year cornerbacks coach Kevin Mathis and second-year receivers coach Jason Phillips also played in the NFL, while offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur and defensive coordinator Robert Livingston are longtime NFL coaches.",

    "text": "WEST MICHIGAN — Ahead of expected lake effect snow, the National Weather Service issued a Winter Weather Advisory for Friday, Jan. 3, 2025.\nThe advisory was scheduled from 4 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday for the following counties in West Michigan: Kalamazoo, Van Buren, Allegan, Barry, Ottawa, Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo and Oceana County.\nLake effect snow was expected to pick back up overnight through the start of Friday, continuing off and on through early Saturday morning.\nGenerally 1 to 4 inches of snow was forecast in the advisory area, but the strongest bands of lake effect may produce locally higher amounts in a few locations.\nThe greatest potential for some localized higher totals was across portions of Ottawa, Allegan, Van Buren and northwest Kalamazoo counties.\nWhile true white out conditions are not anticipated, at least some reduced visibility can be expected due to wind gusts 25 to 30 mph Friday afternoon and evening.\nHigh temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-20s Friday afternoon before falling into the upper teens through Saturday morning.\nColder than average temperatures settle in this weekend and are likely to dominate the forecast through at least mid-January.\nFollow meteorologist Will Haenni on Facebook, X & Instagram.
