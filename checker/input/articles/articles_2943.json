    "text": "The first of 33,000 Boeing workers went on strike early Friday morning after rejecting a contract offer.\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted in overwhelming numbers — by 94.6% — to reject a proposed deal that would have given them raises of at least 25% over the four-year life of the deal.\nThe union, which represents aircraft assembly workers, had asked for pay raises of 40% over three years.\nThe strike is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling aircraft, the 737 Max, but it will not affect commercial flights for the public.\nRELATED STORY | Boeing factory workers are voting whether to strike and shut down aircraft production\nThe company and union leaders say they are ready to head back to the bargaining table.\n“There's a lot at stake here for our members, and so, I am proud of them. We’re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can. I'm not sure what that looks like this evening, but we’ll certainly engage so that we can try to resolve the issues,” said Aerospace Machinists District 751 president Jon Holden.\nIn addition to increased wages, union members are also seeking better job security and more time off.\n\"While there were many important things that were in this offer, it didn't make up, it didn't bridge the gap for 16 years from 2008 and going through two extensions and the threats of job loss, you know, stagnated wages cost shift on health care and many other issues and especially relocation of thousands of jobs for, you know, other programs leaving the state,” Holden said.\nMost of the striking workers were located in Washington state.\nRELATED STORY | Boeing grounds 777X test fleet after finding issue with key engine part",

    "title": "Food for thought: What wildlife need to eat – Marin Independent Journal",
    "text": "Have you ever thought about what animals in the wild need to survive? Like us, they need a balanced diet, which they get over the course of the year: lots of berries in the summer, fresh green growth in the spring, animals for meat, etc. Different animals need different foods: Carnivores eat mostly meat, herbivores eat plants and omnivores consume both. Our local backyard wildlife species, such as skunks, opossums and raccoons, are excellent rodent hunters. They spend their active hours clearing your neighborhoods of rats, mice, slugs, snails, insects and other potentially undesirable pests. Many insects are beneficial, but our local wildlife are just looking for dinner. Opossums are the only marsupial north of Mexico and are native to the eastern United States but have moved west over the centuries and now call most of California home. They’re true omnivores and consume fruits, berries, nuts, pet food, some green plants (your lettuce?), snails, slugs, snakes, frogs, birds and their eggs, along with mice, voles and rats. A large part of their diet is insects, including, apocryphally, ticks. Who doesn’t love something that eats rats and maybe even ticks? They help the gardener who strives to be organic by consuming insects and dispersing seeds. They will feast on roadkill, too. If you have a water source, raccoons will likely be in your garden, but they’re also happy to forage in your green can. My local raccoons get in there and gobble up whatever I’ve dumped in the way of food. Mostly, they’re pretty tidy about not scattering it around our side of the can. They are also fierce hunters and will eat mice, rats and baby birds right from their nests. Skunks are adorable little hunters, too, and if you’re ever lucky enough to have them in your garden in the spring, seeing their babies tussle with each other like kittens is a delightful sight. Do the deer bedevil you by eating your favorite plants? Deer are probably the most annoying animal in terms of damage to the garden, especially the vegetable garden if accessible. Because deer lack upper front teeth, they’ll rip through foliage and uproot newly planted starts. They tend to feed more heavily in the spring and summer months because mothers nursing young and bucks growing horns need more calories to support themselves. As herbivores, they’re going to eat any plants that appeal to them (including poison oak!), so you might consider mixing your desired plants with their least favorites, which include garlic, rosemary, rhubarb, asparagus, oregano and other smelly herbs, with the hope that they don’t find your favored plants. The drier it gets in the summer and fall months, the more likely they are to sample things like succulents, which slake their thirst. Repellents can help deter deer, especially those emitting sulfurous rotten-egg smells. Beware of blood meal in repellents, as your dog may think you’ve left them a nice steak. Be sure to read directions before using repellants on food crops. Your best bet with deer is to fence the areas where you need to exclude them and keep the gates closed. Deer-resistant plants aren’t always effective, so you’ll need to put out samples and see if they eat them. Coyotes are essential to the ecosystem, keeping rodent, jackrabbit and even deer populations in check. Keep pets indoors at dawn, dusk and night to protect them from this opportunistic hunter. Coyotes are generally solitary hunters, but they’ve been observed hunting with badgers, one of our most reclusive carnivores. Gophers eat bulbs, roots and entire plants, which annoys gardeners. Voles go for grass, shrubs and stems, and moles favor worms, grubs and insects. Annoying as they can be, they improve the soil, aerating and moving nutrients around. Let’s not forget birds. Owls, hawks and other raptors also eat rodents, making them important vector controllers. They also eat each other at times — ugh! Smaller birds tend to eat a lot of insects, making them a gardener’s friend, too. We can live with wildlife, and it behooves us to do so since there’s much to be gained by observing the amazing adaptations of our local animals, including insect and rodent control.

[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 24-12-2023 19:55 IST | Created: 24-12-2023 19:55 IST - Country: - India Coming down heavily on West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Sukanta Majumdar, state Minister Shashi Panja said that the former has indirectly shown disrespect to Swami Vivekananda. \"Swami Vivekananda once said you will be nearer to heaven if you play football rather than the study of Gita. Today, West Bengal BJP President Sukanta Majumdar showed disrespect to Swami Vivekananda's thoughts and his sayings,\" the Trinamool Congress (TMC) Minister said. While reacting to a statement by a TMC leader on the Lokkho Konthe Gita Path event in Kolkata, Sukanta said that those who are saying that playing football is better than reciting Gita are 'products' of the 'Left'. \"He (Sukanta) has said that those who have said about football and Gita in this way are illiterate. So indirectly commenting on a state minister who used Swami Vivekananda's quotes to speak about the association of Gita and football, by criticising the Minister, he indirectly showed disrespect to Swami Vivekananda,\" Panja explained. The TMC leader alleged that the BJP has been consistently showing disrespect to Bengali icons, whether it is Swami Vivekananda or Rabindranath Tagore. Panja alleged that the BJP also seems \"confused\" about the literary works of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar. \"Time and again, the BJP has consistently shown disrespect to the icons from Bengal, be it Swami Vivekananda, be it Kobi Guru Rabindranath Tagore, they were not even sure of his place of birth and also Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, when it comes to Barnoporichoy or Sahaj Path they are all very confused,\" Panja said. Describing the BJP as \"outsiders\", the TMC leader said that BJP should apologise for their statement. \"So time and again, these outsiders, who are outsiders to Bengal culture and harmony and what Dr Sukanta Majumdar said today is again a humiliation of Bengal and utmost disrespect to Swami Vivekananda and he must apologise for this...We are showing our protests against such statements,\" Panja said.
