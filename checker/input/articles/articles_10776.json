    "text": "“He’s very focused on situations at hand and doesn’t get distracted by emotion and chaos,” Tammy Cutchen tells PEOPLE of son Wahid Leeman\nBy Alexandra Rockey Fleming Alexandra Rockey Fleming Alexandra Rockey Fleming is a writer-reporter at PEOPLE. She has been covering breaking news, human interest, crime, entertainment and politics for three decades.\nPeople Editorial Guidelines Published on November 7, 2024 04:48PM EST Comments Wahid Leeman. Photo: Courtesy Amethyst Leeman\nWahid Leeman, 20, has more than his fair share of challenges, including bipolar disorder, sickle cell anemia and ADHD. His physical and mental health symptoms are due to drug exposure in the womb.\nLike many other young Americans, he was diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) at birth, which occurs when a developing fetus is exposed to opioids and is born dependent on substances.\nWahid’s birth mother was in and out of his life, alternating between addiction and recovery, and died from an accidental overdose when Wahid was 14. “I wish she wouldn’t have done it,” he tells PEOPLE in this week's issue of his birth mother’s drug use. “But I feel like she was doing the best she could at the time.”\nA high school-aged Wahid practicing using a stethoscope on his mother. Courtesy Tammy Cutchen\nAt age 2, Wahid was adopted by Tammy Cutchen and Steve Leeman, who live in a community off the Maine coast. Steve is a lobsterman while Tammy cares for the family’s 11 children. Both Wahid and one of his siblings share an NAS diagnosis.\nTammy says Wahid’s path to adulthood has been rocky. He has “a lot of anger around his mother’s choices,” she says. He also has reactive attachment disorder, which blunts his impulse control — a combustible combination.\n'Miracle Baby' Born Addicted to Drugs: 'I Blamed Myself Every Day for What She Was Going Through,' Says Mom Wahid was incredibly destructive as a child, she says, breaking down doors, putting fists through walls and shattering windows. Once, when Wahid was 7, he even tried to jump out of the car because Tammy refused to stop for fast food.\n“Raising Wahid was the hardest job I ever had,” she adds. “I have no idea how we got through it.”\nFor more on Wahid's story, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday, or subscribe here .\nWith hindsight, Tammy takes responsibility for elevating some of Wahid’s outbursts because, “I put him in situations and places his system could not handle and then blamed him for that.”\nThis awareness is informing how she and Steve raise 8-year-old son Cruz Leeman, who has similar behavioral symptoms as his brother. “With Cruz we make great pains to keep his world as small as possible while still allowing him to have a variety of experiences,” Tammy says.\nAs a young adult, Wahid is aware of the ways his impulse-control issues can complicate his life — with long-term friendships, for example. “Like if someone did one thing wrong, I’m cutting them off. Or it could be like wanting to tell someone about something and blowing up their phone with calls and texts even if they don’t answer,\" he says. \"This can cause relationships and friendships to end. I can feel really really really crummy about that.”\nWahid Leeman, now 20. Amethyst Leeman\nBut Wahid’s NAS manifestations don’t cloud his enthusiasm for life. He loves fishing and swimming, he's a fan of reptiles — including his day gecko Lizzy — and he’s happy with his food-service job, “because I like money as well as the next person.\"\nHowever, securing his future is his most important task at hand. Wahid is studying to be an EMT at a local community college. Next year, he plans to complete his courses “to make myself fully employable at one of the major fire departments.\"\n\"My goal is to be a firefighter-paramedic,\" he adds.\nMy Baby Was Born Addicted to Drugs: Innovative West Virginia Clinic Nurses Newborns Through Opioid Withdrawal His mom believes a career as a first responder could be very good for her son, providing him the opportunity to cast his differing abilities as a positive. “He’s very focused on situations at hand and doesn’t get distracted by emotion and chaos,” she says. “In an emergency, he would do what’s right to keep people safe.”\nTammy says she and Wahid share a remarkable bond. “Wahid is special,\" she adds. \"He has worked really hard and overcome so much.”\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, please contact the SAMHSA helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.\nClose",

    "text": "31.6 million inhabitants of various regions of Mexico, the US and Canada can enjoy a total solar eclipse this day that will last more than 4 minutes.\nThe first area of ​​continental North America where totality of the eclipse will be seen will be the Mexican Pacific coast, at around 11:07 am (PDT). The first city in which the phenomenon began to be recorded is Mazatlán, in the state of Sinaloa.\nThe phenomenon will pass through more than 15 US states (from Texas to Maine), cross the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and end on the Canadian island of Newfoundland.\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the solar disk. While the event is taking place, the solar corona is visible to the naked eye.\nOne of the big differences between the 2017 eclipse and today’s is the magnetic activity of the Sun. The star has its own cycle, called the ‘solar cycle’, which lasts about 11 years. During that time, its magnetic activity waxes and wanes. The 2017 eclipse occurred near solar minimum, a low magnetic activity.\nNASA predicts that for the next eclipse there will be solar maximum, which means that there will be a greater chance of seeing streamers in the solar corona, as well as bulges (bright pink curls coming out of the Sun). At the same time, he stressed that it is possible that a coronal mass ejection could be visualized during the eclipse.\n#Total #solar #eclipse #crosses #sky #North #America #Diario #Página",

    "title": "Este fármaco alarga la vida en ratones (y podría ser usado en humanos)",
    "text": "En el fascinante campo de la biología del envejecimiento, un nuevo estudio publicado en Nature ha revelado que los ratones pueden experimentar un extraordinario rejuvenecimiento a través de la inhibición de una proteína específica llamada IL-11 . Esta investigación , que destaca el papel crucial de IL-11 en la regulación de enfermedades asociadas a la edad y la longevidad, podría ser un paso hacia la ansiada fuente de la juventud. La IL-11, una citoquina proinflamatoria de la familia de IL-6 , se ha identificado como un factor clave en estos procesos. A medida que los ratones envejecen, la IL-11 se regula al alza en diversos tipos celulares y tejidos, afectando vías críticas como ERK, AMPK y mTORC1, las cuales son esenciales para la salud metabólica y la longevidad. Descubrimientos clave en el estudio de IL-11 Para realizar el experimento, los investigadores inyectaron un anticuerpo anti IL-11 en ratones de 75 semanas, lo que equivale a una persona de aproximadamente 55 años. Los resultados fueron sorprendentes: los ratones tratados vivieron un 22,4% más los machos y un 25% más las hembras , alcanzando una media de 155 semanas de vida frente a las 120 semanas de los no tratados. Además, el fármaco no solo prolongó su vida, sino que mejoró su salud general, reduciendo la incidencia de cáncer y otras enfermedades relacionadas con el envejecimiento, como la fibrosis, la inflamación crónica y el metabolismo deficiente. Apenas se observaron efectos secundarios . Los ratones tratados presentaron menos cánceres y no mostraron los signos habituales de envejecimiento y fragilidad. También se observó una reducción del desgaste muscular y una mejora en la fuerza muscular. Es decir, los ratones viejos que recibieron anti-IL11 estaban más sanos. Proyección en humanos Estos descubrimientos abren nuevas vías para tratamientos que no solo prolonguen la vida sino que también mejoren la calidad de vida en la vejez. Al enfocar terapias en la inhibición de IL-11, se podría mitigar la inflamación crónica y mejorar la salud metabólica, dos pilares fundamentales en la lucha contra el envejecimiento. Aunque el trabajo se realizó en ratones, se espera que estos hallazgos sean muy relevantes para la salud humana , dado que hemos observado efectos similares en estudios de células y tejidos humanos. Así, esta investigación es un paso importante hacia una mejor comprensión del envejecimiento y se ha demostrado, en ratones, una terapia que podría potencialmente prolongar el envejecimiento saludable, al reducir la fragilidad y las manifestaciones fisiológicas del envejecimiento. Por consiguiente, desde el laboratorio de Londres, sugieren la \"tentadora posibilidad\" de que esta inyección pueda tener efectos similares en personas mayores, ya que los tratamientos anti-IL-11 han comenzado sus ensayos clínicos en humanos para otras enfermedades. Esta investigación se originó en 2017, cuando la profesora adjunta Anissa Widjaja , de la Facultad de Medicina de Duke-NUS en Singapur, empezó a examinar muestras de tejido para medir los niveles de la proteína IL-11. Con todo, los científicos recalcan que es necesario seguir investigando la seguridad y eficacia de esta inyección en ensayos clínicos en humanos antes de considerar su uso para esta nueva finalidad.",
