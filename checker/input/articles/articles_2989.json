Futurism reports: The contraption, as seen in a video that's been making its rounds on social media, sparked a frenzied debate over our undying attempts to turn dystopian tech yanked straight out of the \"Terminator\" franchise into a reality. STS 3D's invention also apparently caught the attention of OpenAI, who says it swiftly shut him down for violating its policies. When Futurism reached out to the company, a spokesperson said that \"we proactively identified this violation of our policies and notified the developer to cease this activity ahead of receiving your inquiry.\" STS 3D -- who didn't respond to our request for comment -- used OpenAI's Realtime API to give his weapon a cheery voice and a way to decipher his commands. \"ChatGPT, we're under attack from the front left and front right,\" he told the system in the video. \"Respond accordingly.\" Without skipping a beat, the rifle jumped into action, shooting what appeared to be blanks while aiming at the nearby walls.Read more of this story at Slashdot.\nClick here to read full news..\nAll Channels\nNigerian Dailies:\nPunch\n|\nVanguard\n|\nThe Nation\n|\nThisday\n|\nDaily Sun\n|\nGuardian\n|\nDaily Times\n|\nDaily Trust\n|\nDaily Independent\n|\nThe Herald\n|\nTribune\n|\nLeadership\n|\nNational Mirror\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nNew Telegraph\n|\nPeoples Daily\n|\nBlueprint\n|\nNigerian Pilot\n|\nSahara Reporters\n|\nPremium Times\n|\nThe Cable\n|\nPM News\n|\nAPO Africa Newsroom\nCategories Today:\nWorld\n|\nSports\n|\nTechnology\n|\nEntertainment\n|\nBusiness\n|\nPolitics\n|\nColumns\n|\nAll Headlines Today\nEntertainment (Local):\nLinda Ikeji\n|\nBella Naija\n|\nTori\n|\nDaily News 24\n|\nPulse\n|\nThe NET\n|\nDailyPost\n|\nInformation Nigeria\n|\nGistlover\n|\nLailas Blog\n|\nMiss Petite\n|\nOlufamous\n|\nStella Dimoko Korkus Blog\n|\nYnaija\n|\nAll Entertainment News Today\nEntertainment (World):\nTMZ\n|\nDaily Mail\n|\nHuffington Post\nSports:\nGoal\n|\nAfrican Football\n|\nBleacher Report\n|\nFTBpro\n|\nKickoff\n|\nAll Sports Headlines Today\nBusiness & Finance:\nNairametrics\n|\nNigerian Tenders\n|\nBusiness Insider\n|\nForbes\n|\nEntrepreneur\n|\nThe Economist\n|\nBusinessTech\n|\nFinancial Watch\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nAll Business News Headlines Today\nTechnology (Local):\nTechpoint\n|\nTechMoran\n|\nTechCity\n|\nInnovation Village\n|\nIT News Africa\n|\nTechnology Times\n|\nTechnext\n|\nTechcabal\n|\nAll Technology News Headlines Today\nTechnology (World):\nTechcrunch\n|\nTechmeme\n|\nSlashdot\n|\nWired\n|\nHackers News\n|\nEngadget\n|\nPocket Lint\n|\nThe Verge\nInternational Networks:\n|\nCNN\n|\nBBC\n|\nAl Jazeera\n|\nYahoo\nForum:\n|\nNairaland\n|\nNaij\nOther Links:\nHome\n|\nNigerian Jobs\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDisclaimer\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nCopyright\n|\nSubscribe To News Alert\n|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners\nCopyright © 2025. latestnigeriannews.com - All rights reserved",

But what does this remarkable planetary conjunction truly mean?\ninterviewer (Senior Editor, world-today-news.com): Dr. Anya Sharma, renowned astrophysicist and planetary scientist, welcome to world-today-news.com. Josh Thura’s stunning photograph of this rare planetary alignment has captivated the world. can you explain, in simple terms, what a planetary conjunction is and why this particular event is so significant?\nDr. Sharma: thank you for having me. A planetary conjunction is simply when multiple planets appear close together in the night sky, from our Earthly viewpoint. It’s a matter of celestial geometry; the planets aren’t actually physically aligned in a straight line throughout space. The significance of this particular event lies in its rarity. While conjunctions of two or three planets are relatively common,an alignment featuring eight—as seen in Thura’s remarkable image—is an exceptionally rare celestial event. It’s a testament to the intricate dance of our solar system’s planetary orbits. The appearance of this many planets in close proximity is a captivating display of celestial mechanics, making it a noteworthy astronomical occurrence.\nInterviewer: The photograph showcases Mars,Jupiter,Mercury,Venus,Saturn,Uranus,and Neptune,alongside Earth. Is ther a particular reason why certain planets are more easily visible during these alignments than others? are there any planets especially challenging to observe even with elegant equipment?\nDr. Sharma: Absolutely. The visibility of a planet during a conjunction depends on several factors: its inherent brightness, its distance from Earth, and its position relative to the sun. Brighter planets, like Venus and Jupiter, are easier to spot with the naked eye , even in light-polluted areas. Conversely, planets like Uranus and Neptune are substantially fainter and require binoculars or a telescope for observation . Their great distance from Earth contributes to their lower apparent brightness. Even with powerful equipment, capturing all eight planets in a single shot, as Thura achieved, is a remarkable feat of astrophotography.\nInterviewer: Thura’s image showcases the beauty of the night sky but also highlights the challenge of light pollution. How significant is light pollution in impacting our ability to observe these celestial events? What are the practical consequences of light pollution for astronomical observation?\nDr. Sharma: Light pollution significantly hinders astronomical observation. Artificial light from cities and towns washes out the fainter celestial objects , making it tough to see planets, stars, and nebulae. This obscures visual delights such as the Milky Way, which was once a common sight from even moderately populated areas. The consequences are far-reaching. Beyond the loss of aesthetic thankfulness, light pollution impacts scientific research, as astronomers depend on dark skies for optimal observing conditions.It disrupts nocturnal ecosystems, from the patterns of nocturnal animals to photosynthetic reactions in plants. Mitigating light pollution requires a collective effort , including the implementation of responsible outdoor lighting practices, such as shielding and reducing light intensity.\nInterviewer: This particular planetary alignment won’t happen again until 2040. how can amateur astronomers and space enthusiasts prepare to witness such events when they do happen? What equipment or resources might they require?\ndr. Sharma: Here’s how to effectively plan for observing planetary alignments:\nFind a dark sky location: Escape light-polluted urban areas. Dark sky parks and rural regions offer dramatically superior viewing conditions. Use a stargazing app: Applications like Stellarium or SkySafari will chart the planets’ positions, enabling effective planning of viewing sessions. Choose your equipment: Binoculars are ideal for brighter planets, but telescopes are best for more distant, fainter celestial bodies. A sturdy tripod is indispensable for both to stabilize views and for astrophotography. Practice patient observation: Allow your eyes ample time to adjust to the darkness. Interviewer: Dr. Sharma, thank you for these insightful answers. This rare planetary alignment offers a unique opportunity to appreciate the cosmos’ breathtaking beauty and to inspire new generations to engage with astronomy.\nConcluding Thought: Josh Thura’s photograph is not merely a beautiful picture; it’s a powerful reminder of our place in a vast and wondrous universe. Let’s discuss on social media how this unique astronomical event inspires your desire to explore the night sky!

This breathtaking spectacle, recently captured in a stunning photograph, sparks questions about planetary conjunctions and the challenges of observing these celestial wonders. Let’s delve into this fascinating topic with Dr. Aris Thorne,a leading astrophysicist specializing in planetary dynamics.\nInterviewer (Senior Editor, world-today-news.com): Dr. Thorne, welcome to world-today-news.com. Josh Thura’s photograph of a rare planetary alignment has captivated the world. Can you explain, in simple terms, what a planetary conjunction is and why this particular event, featuring eight planets, holds significant astronomical importance?\nDr. Thorne: Thank you for having me. A planetary conjunction occurs when several planets in our solar system appear to cluster together in the sky from our perspective on Earth. It’s a purely visual affect; the planets aren’t actually physically aligned in a perfect line across space.their orbits around the Sun simply bring them into apparent proximity at certain points. The meaning of this eight-planet alignment lies in its extreme rarity. while conjunctions involving two or three planets are relatively frequent,an alignment featuring this many planets is exceptional. It’s a visual portrayal of the intricate, dynamic interplay of gravitational forces shaping our solar system’s planetary ballet. These rare events provide valuable opportunities for observation and deepen our understanding of orbital mechanics.\nInterviewer: The photograph depicts Mars, Jupiter, mercury, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, alongside Earth. Why are some planets, like Venus or Jupiter, easier to see than others, even with complex equipment like telescopes? Are there planets particularly challenging to observe even under ideal conditions?\nDr. Thorne: The visibility of a planet during a conjunction is determined by factors including its intrinsic brightness (its luminosity), its distance from Earth, and its position relative to the sun. Brighter planets, such as Venus and Jupiter, reflect more sunlight and appear significantly larger in our sky , making them relatively easy to observe, even with the naked eye under dark skies.Conversely, planets like Uranus and neptune are much fainter due to their immense distances from Earth. Even with advanced telescopes, observing them requires optimal atmospheric conditions and skilled observation techniques. This is why Thura’s achievement of capturing all eight in one image is a remarkable exhibition of astrophotographic skills and careful planning.\nInterviewer: Thura’s image also highlights the challenges posed by light pollution. What is the impact of light pollution on our ability to appreciate and study celestial events like planetary alignments?\nDr. Thorne: Light pollution drastically obscures the night sky,significantly impacting astronomical observation. Artificial light from cities and towns washes out the fainter celestial objects , making it arduous to see not just planets, but also stars, galaxies, and nebulae. This has wide-ranging consequences. Beyond the lost aesthetic experience of viewing a truly dark sky filled with stars, light pollution hinders scientific research, impacting astronomers’ ability to make crucial observations. It also harms nocturnal ecosystems, affecting the behavior of plants and animals adapted to dark environments. Reducing light pollution requires adopting responsible outdoor lighting practices ,including shielding lights,reducing intensity,and employing more efficient and environmentally friendly technologies.\nInterviewer: This specific eight-planet alignment won’t recur until 2040. How can amateur astronomers and space enthusiasts prepare to witness future planetary alignments or other celestial events? What tools and resources are recommended?\nDr. Thorne: Planning for optimal celestial viewing involves these key steps:\nLocate Dark-Sky Sites: Escape urban light pollution by finding a location far from city lights, such as a rural area or designated dark-sky park. Utilize Astronomy Apps: Applications like Stellarium or other astronomical software provide real-time sky charts, enabling precise prediction of planetary positions and optimal viewing times. Choose Appropriate Equipment: Binoculars suffice for observing brighter planets,but a telescope is crucial for fainter,more distant objects. A sturdy tripod is essential for stability, particularly for astrophotography. Embrace Patience: Allow your eyes to fully adapt to darkness for at least 20 minutes before starting your observations for enhanced visual acuity. Interviewer: Dr. Thorne, thank you for sharing your expertise. This unusual planetary alignment isn’t just a visually spectacular event; it’s a profound reminder of the intricate celestial mechanisms shaping our universe.\nConcluding Thought: josh thura’s photograph is a powerful testament to the beauty and wonder of our solar system.

    "title": "Colorado Camper Killed Mountain Lion with a Shovel as It Fought His Husky",
    "text": "A man who was camping in Colorado killed a mountain lion with a shovel on Sept. 25, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The man, whose identity has not been released, claimed self-defense, telling wildlife officials that he feared for his life when the adult female lion approached him and his dog in front of his RV. He said it was acting “unusual and extremely aggressive” and that he struck the lion with a shovel as it tussled with his dog.\nCPW spokesperson Bill Vogrin tells Outdoor Life that the agency is unable to comment or provide further details about the incident, as it remains under investigation. According to a press release issued by the agency Wednesday, that investigation began on Sept. 26, when a wildlife officer went out to the campground, which lies west of Canon City in Fremont County. The officer arrived to find the dead lion — a 95-pound female — on the hood of the man’s Jeep.\nRead Next: Shed Hunter Killed in California Mountain Lion Attack Died Protecting His Brother\n“The man told CPW that he was sitting outside his recreational vehicle with his dog the previous night when a mountain lion approached them,” CPW explains in the press release. “The man said his dog, a husky, began growling and barking as the lion approached. When the lion got within about 10 feet, the dog engaged it and the man grabbed a shovel, which he used to strike the lion in the head, killing it.”\nAfter hearing the man’s version of events and looking at the scene, the wildlife officer’s “preliminary finding” was that the man acted in self defense. The officer also noted that the mountain lion had an injured front right paw and scratches along its back, which could help explain its boldness; it’s not uncommon for sick or injured lions to be involved in human-cat conflicts. A full necropsy of the lion is being performed at a CPW animal health lab.\nOfficials say that because the animal never touched or injured the man, the incident is not considered a mountain lion attack. There have only been 25 instances of mountain lions attacking humans since 1990, according to CPW’s records. The two most recent attacks occurred in Chaffee County in 2023, according to Vogrin, and neither of those were fatal.\nRead Next: A Big Cat Hunting Ban Would Cost Colorado More Than $60 Million, Study Shows\nThe state’s ongoing investigation into the killed lion comes just five weeks before Colorodans vote on Proposition 127, which would ban all mountain lion hunting in the state. The ballot measure is extremely controversial, and has been met with plenty of resistance from Colorado hunters, who view it as a disingenuous attempt to chip away at hunting rights and turn public perception against hunters by a minority group of animal-rights activists. They say that in addition to undermining the basic principles of science-based wildlife management, a lion hunting ban would lead to lower deer and elk densities and a higher number of conflicts between humans and cougars.",
