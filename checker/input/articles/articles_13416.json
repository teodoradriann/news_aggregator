    "title": "Le prix de l'or en hausse grâce aux paris sur la réduction des taux d'intérêt américains et aux problèmes du Moyen-Orient - Zonebourse",
    "text": "Le prix de l'or a légèrement augmenté mardi, soutenu par les paris selon lesquels la Réserve fédérale américaine réduirait ses taux d'intérêt dans le courant de l'année et par la demande de lingots en tant que valeur refuge alors que le cessez-le-feu à Gaza reste incertain. L'or au comptant était en hausse de 0,1 % à 2 324,75 $ l'once, à 0148 GMT, après avoir augmenté de plus de 1 % au cours de la session précédente.\nLes contrats à terme sur l'or américain se sont raffermis de 0,1% à 2 334,30 $ l'once.\n\"L'or a lentement construit une base au cours de la semaine dernière, pour montrer que la demande se situe autour de 2 280 $. La Fed continue de faire du bruit sur le fait que le prochain mouvement sera probablement plus bas, et cela a certainement aidé à secouer quelques baissiers à ces niveaux bas\", a déclaré Matt Simpson, analyste senior chez City Index.\nLe président de la Fed Bank of New York, John Williams, a déclaré lundi que la banque centrale américaine abaisserait son taux d'intérêt cible à un moment indéterminé. Il n'a pas proposé de calendrier d'action, mais a déclaré que l'économie était globalement en train de retrouver un meilleur équilibre.\nSelon l'outil FedWatch du CME, les traders estiment à 64 % la probabilité d'une baisse des taux de la Fed en septembre. Des taux plus bas augmentent l'intérêt de détenir de l'or non productif d'intérêts.\n\"Les craintes que le cessez-le-feu à Gaza ne soit pas respecté ont également aidé le lingot, a ajouté M. Simpson.\nLes investisseurs ont également suivi de près les derniers développements du conflit au Moyen-Orient. Le groupe militant palestinien Hamas a accepté lundi une proposition de cessez-le-feu à Gaza émanant de médiateurs, mais Israël a déclaré que les conditions ne répondaient pas à ses exigences et a poursuivi ses frappes à Rafah tout en prévoyant de poursuivre les négociations en vue d'un accord.\nL'argent au comptant a baissé de 0,4 % à 27,34 dollars l'once, tandis que le platine a gagné 0,4 % à 957,90 dollars.\nLe palladium a augmenté de 0,3% à 980,75 dollars.\n\"Le programme de mise à la casse de la Chine pourrait stimuler les ventes de véhicules électriques et augmenter l'offre de palladium secondaire\", ont écrit les analystes de Heraeus dans une note datée de lundi.",

    "text": "Although smartphones have taken over computers, the truth is that they continue to be essential in our lives, especially at work, and although we can do practically the same things with the phone as with the PC, there are many tasks which are better from the computer screen.\nAlthough it is true that mobile phones are where we usually store the most sensitive and important information, which is what needs to be protected the most, our computers are also loaded with important personal and banking data, and therefore It is crucial to ensure they are properly protected.\nAs reported by Bit Life Media, according to StatCounter data, Windows 10 continues to lead the market with a 62% share globally . Although Microsoft launched Windows 11 in 2021, the data indicates that adoption has been minimal, with only 32% of computers updated with this operating system, mainly due to the strict hardware requirements, which have caused thousands of computers become outdated.\nAs we said, the vast majority of computers, specifically More than 60% of computers worldwide still use Windows 10, but in 2025 this operating system is approaching the end of its useful life. It is planned that for October of this year marks the end of official support for Windows 10 which would leave thousands of computers at risk suffer cyber attacks and compatibility problems, a situation that worries both users and technology experts.\nThe lack of system updates has serious consequences on our computers, for example, the absence of security patches opens the door to malware and cyberattacks exploiting known vulnerabilities. It must also be taken into account that Outdated systems may become incompatible with new software and hardware limiting its functionality and efficiency.\nWe also cannot forget that companies that ignore updates can breach cybersecurity regulations and face fines or sanctions aggravating the challenges of the technological transition. To deal with this problem, users have up to three options.\nThe three options for Windows 10 users 1. Migrate to Windows 11\nPossibly the most logical and direct of all, since you only have to update the equipment. The problem is that as we said not all computers are compatible so there is a possibility that you will have to change computers and the grace of Windows 11 will be more expensive.\n2. Buy an extended support\nMicrosoft understands that buying a new computer is not in everyone’s budget, and as an option it offers the possibility of purchasing extended security updates. In the case of Companies will be able to acquire these for about 60 euros the first year but in the following years the cost of this support will increase over the years, For individual users the cost will be 30 years, although they only extend it for one year.\n3. Use unofficial patches\nAlthough cybersecurity experts always recommend doing things through official means, there are legitimate companies that have committed to this cause, for example, 0patch has assured that it will offer Windows 10 support through security patches until 2030, although you will have to pay for these as well.\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#computers #risk #options #protect",

    "text": "Scientists are developing a digital space model around the Earth in order to boost solar storm forecasting and improve infrastructure effects. Space Weather Understanding After almost seventy years in the space age, the understanding of space weather remains crude. In contrast to terrestrial weather that is currently forecasted by strong supercomputers with incredible timeliness and accuracy, predictions of space weather have a more hit-or-miss nature. In most cases, inaccurate forecasts of space weather refers to when one's expectations for viewing auroras are not met. However, humanity is becoming more dependent on certain technologies that are vulnerable to space weather whims. With GPS disruptions and brief radio blackouts, among other things, space weather can affect daily living.

However, the scientists admit that it may necessarily take decades for the forecasting and predictions of space weather to catch up fully. Space physicist Slava Merkin from APL, who also serves as the director of the Center for Geospace Storms (CGS), explains that space weather cannot be predicted without first knowing the physics behind it. Merkin adds that they are constructing a model and conducting science with the model. Through this, they are discovering more about geospace storm physics. Geospace generally refers to the region surrounding the Earth which covers the upper atmosphere of the planet and the space that surrounds it. With the novel model MAGE (Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment), the scientists aim to capture the processes happening in space up to a distance from Earth that spans 2 million kilometers. This coverage is quite huge, being equivalent to four times the Earth-Moon distance. However, the influence of the Earth in the cosmos has an even greater stretch. The Earth's magnetosphere interacts with solar wind bursts, which is an interaction that leads to space weather events that can be experienced from Earth. The exact process is quite intricate, involving physical interactions in the ionosphere and thermosphere that are minimally understood. Merkin explains that their greatest challenge comes with holistically treating the system. However, the issue comes with how different physics govern the domains. In 2020, the team celebrated a success when their nascent model was able to offer unexpected insights regarding the formation of structures in the aurora that resemble beads and that occasionally appear over the polar regions of the Earth before strong geomagnetic storms happen. The [MAGE model](https://ts2.space/en/enhancing-space-weather-predictions-through-advanced-digital-modeling/) then revealed that these polar light pearls surface when the magnetic lines in the magnetotail have a far stretch from the planet prior to the geomagnetic storms. They then slingshot light plasma bubbles towards the Earth. However, the discovery showed space weather forecast difficulties. Merkin explains that the computer model they are working on must be able to capture the processes that happen on both large and small scales. It must also be able to capture the various physics issues and understand how different domains affect one another. The model has to capitalize on fewer data points compared to models for forecasting terrestrial weather. While Merkin and the team can access data that dates back to the start of the space age, there are still major gaps that exist. MAGE could help bridge some gaps by capitalizing on strong supercomputing and intricate measurements gathered by satellites situated in the atmosphere and by radars and other ground sensors. Merkin explains that as they go, the model gets more complex, with more and more physics being added to it. The ultimate end will then represent geospace and its complexity.
