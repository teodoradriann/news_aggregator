    "title": "UK faces flash flooding, lightning storms and scorching heat in turbulent weekend of weather",
    "text": "The UK will continue to enjoy the warm weather over the weekend, but in some areas it will be punctuated with wet and stormy downpours. Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge told The Independent that the storm impact in some areas could be “significant”, with “flash flooding, large hail, frequent lightning and even squally winds”. The Met Office said there could be between 50mm and 100mm of rain on Thursday during the storms, which amounts to around one month’s worth of rainfall. A yellow weather warning for today (Thursday) covers large parts of the south (Met Office) But some areas within the weather warning zone “won’t witness any impacts” and may “enjoy potentially fine conditions”, Mr Madge said. All parts of the UK can expect to see rain at some point over the weekend as thunderstorms sweep across the nation, possibly starting in northern areas later on Thursday. It will be “hot and humid” for the rest of the day for those in south England, particularly in the south east, with temperatures touching on 27C into the evening and some more “unpleasant sleeping conditions” overnight. A front of rain will enter the UK from the northwest on Friday, reaching up to 30mm (Met Office) Friday will be warm and dry for most of the south and east, while a torrent of rain sweeps across Scotland and strikes northwest England and parts of the midlands into the evening. Temperatures will peak at 28C in London and the southeast, while the southwest peaks at 20C, the northwest at 23C, and Scotland at 18C. Saturday and Sunday will see temperatures drop to highs of between 18C and 23C across the UK. “The heat and humidity of the last few days will give way to fresher conditions from tomorrow and into Saturday,” Mr Madge said. “Over the weekend there will be some fine conditions – interspersed with spells of rain for some – but temperatures will be a few degrees lower than the last few days.” A Met Office weather map suggests pockets of the southeast face more than 32mm rain on Saturday afternoon (Met Office) Those who find themselves in a thunderstorm have been advised to not use mobile phones, umbrellas, or to stand under trees if their area is struck by storm. On Thursday night the UK can expect “thundery showers” which will ease through the evening, while many across the UK remain in dry spells, the Met Office website reads. It will be a “warm, muggy” night in the south, it says. Friday will see “cloud and rain edging into the northwest” while it will be “mostly dry elsewhere with sunny spells” and a “few heavy showers in the east”. Parts of Scotland may face more than 30mm of rainfall on Friday, Met Office weather maps show, with the south and southeast facing the same fate on Saturday. Another heavy front of rain is then expected to strike from the northwest side of the UK in the early hours of Monday.

Fue un partido difícil para las dirigidas por Ángelo Marsiglia , que se vieron superadas en el primer tiempo, pero en el complemento mejoraron y por poco logran la igualdad.\nLa figura de la cancha fue Marie-Antoinette Katoto , quien inició marcando en apenas seis minutos de juego tras aprovechar un error de la defensa colombiana. Kenza Dali, sobre el 18′, marcó el segundo y e nuevamente Katoto, al 42′, puso el 0-3 con el que las galas se fueron al descanso.\nPara el complemento, el entrenador colombiano decidió hacer una variante con la inclusión de Manuela Pavi en reemplazo de Daniela Montoya. Con este movimiento pudo generar más volumen de ataque y encontró el gol del descuento. Lo marcó Catalina Usme desde el punto penal, luego de que Mayra Ramírez fuera derribada dentro del área por la arquera rival.\nFinalmente, la encargada de anotar el segundo de Colombia fue la propia Manuela Pavi, tras recibir un pase de Marcela Restrepo y definir sola ante la arquera, en una gran anotación.\nLa mala noticia la terminó dando la delantera Mayra Ramírez , quien cometió una fuerte falta contra la jugadora Selma Bacha. En principio, fue amonestada con cartulina amarilla, pero tras la revisión del VAR, la juez central la expulsó y no podrá estar ante Nueva Zelanda.\n¿Cómo quedó el Grupo A? Antes del juego entre Colombia y Francia, Canadá, vigente campeona olímpica, se impuso 2-1 contra Nueva Zelanda.

    "text": "Silicon Labs and Kudelski IoT Collaborate to Expedite Matter Device Certification\nSilicon Labs, in collaboration with Kudelski IoT, unveiled a novel way to expedite the market entry of Matter-certified IoT products. The partnership incorporates Kudelski IoT’s Matter Device Attestation Certificates (DAC) into Silicon Labs’ Custom Part Manufacturing Service (CPMS), allowing device manufacturers to establish Zero Trust security from production to delivery, hence reducing time and expenses.\nThe Zero Trust model, characterized by its “never trust, always verify” philosophy and ongoing verification, is essential to Matter, a cohesive, IP-based communication protocol. Matter requires distinct device authentication certificates through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for enhanced security. This architecture greatly improves IoT device security but also presents new challenges for manufacturers, especially in the secure acquisition and transmission of certificates from Certificate Authorities to production sites.\nBy integrating Silicon Labs’ safe, cost-effective, and reliable manufacturing capabilities with Kudelski’s certified Matter PKI service, IoT manufacturers may now securely inject Matter DACs during production, thereby facilitating the transition to Matter volume manufacturing.\nSilicon Labs asserts that the volume manufacture of Matter need not be a complicated obstacle. Their unprecedented safe provisioning solution, along with Kudelski IoT’s proficiency and PKI services, will allow manufacturers to concentrate on innovation while maintaining security integrity.\nThe combined CPMS and DAC injection service offers numerous significant advantages:\n- Secure injection of signed DACs at Silicon Labs-designated factories\n- Simplified key management and reduced manufacturing complexity\n- Accelerated time-to-market for Matter-certified products\n- Enhanced protection against counterfeiting and overproduction\nSilicon Labs’ Matter DAC injection is now accessible for the MG24 wireless SoCs and modules equipped with Secure Vault technology. Upon finalizing product development and securing Matter certification with the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), manufacturers can effortlessly place orders using the Silicon Labs CPMS web platform. Silicon Labs will dispatch sample components within 4-6 weeks for testing and validation, after which bulk orders may be placed.",

    "text": "Two macro figures that are worrying for the Israeli economy hit us recently. The first was the Consumer Price Index reading for July, which showed inflation running at an annual rate of 3.2%, which is above the Bank of Israel’s target range, and higher than market forecasts.\nThis is contrary to the trend of moderating inflation in the US and Europe. The second figure is the 1.2% annualized growth rate in the second quarter, dramatically lower than market expectations. After the growth figure was released, one after another, four major US banks issued reviews of the Israeli economy. These contained plenty of warnings, but all of them stated that, if steps were taken to stabilize the economy, it would go back to being as attractive as it was in the past.\nRELATED ARTICLES Should Budget Commissioner quit or back down? Citi sees Israel at risk of further rating downgrades JPMorgan cuts Israel's 2024 growth forecast BoI governor to PM: Get going on the budget Per capita growth negative in Q2 Such steps are not, however, forthcoming. Measures to maintain the fiscal framework, for example. We received a fresh example this week, in Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich’s campaign to finance continued evacuation of residents of Israel’s northern and southern border areas, and the budget for reserve soldiers. Since the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Finance’s forecast for the fiscal deficit in 2024 has been 6.6% of GDP. Citi finds that unconvincing; its estimate is 8.5%. It also believes that the Ministry of Finance itself is unconvinced, citing officials as saying that there is a risk of a larger fiscal deficit this year because of the escalation in the north and other factors.\nMorgan Stanley also noted the rise in the deficit, and cut its growth forecast for Israel for this year, as did JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Citi. Citi also warned about Israel’s credit rating and the quality of the institutions and governance in Israel.\nThe war and the geo-political risks are not the whole story. Even the Governor of the Bank of Israel wrote this week, black on white, that there were factors beyond those. To reassure the markets even a little while the fighting rages, the least that can be done is to adopt a responsible policy and to advance the 2025 budget, even if it contains painful measures. The alternative is liable to be far more painful and costly.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on August 22, 2024.\n© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2024.",

    "text": "Next season, the Lakers will have a Big 3 — Here’s how it will happen\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are on the verge of forming a new 'Big 3' for next season, featuring LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and the emerging star, Austin Reaves. Reaves, who is showing significant growth, is expected to make his All-Star debut, solidifying the trio's status.
