    "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThese displays are banned in US, and here's how it affects Pixel 10 and iPhone 17\n19 seconds ago\n- The International Trade Commission has decided to ban BOE’s OLED screens from the US.\n- However, a display expert says companies like Apple and Google can still sell devices with BOE screens in the US.\n- The ruling could adversely affect the repair market, though.\nThe International Trade Commission (ITC) recently ruled that it would ban display maker BOE’s OLED screens from the US market. The ban, which isn’t final, could see BOE banned from the country for almost 15 years. But what does this mean for smartphone makers like Apple, Google, and others that use BOE displays?\nDisplay analyst Ross Young noted on Twitter that the ban could have “little impact” on brands like Apple and Google as they’d still be able to sell their phones in the US. Check out the tweet below.\nUnfortunately, Young adds that this ban would hurt the repair market. That’s bad news for consumers, as it means they might not have recourse in the event of a broken phone screen. Even if you can get your display fixed in the first place, a limited supply of replacement screens could theoretically lead to much higher screen repair costs. This could be particularly problematic for upcoming phone releases, as manufacturers and repair agents might not have the chance to stockpile replacement screens.\nWe also asked OnePlus earlier this week about the ramifications of a BOE ban in the US. However, the company refused to comment on the matter. If Young’s claims hold true, though, then OnePlus doesn’t necessarily have to worry about OnePlus 15 sales.\nEither way, this preliminary display ban might not affect sales of smartphones with BOE screens. So I don’t anticipate sales issues with the Pixel 10 series or iPhone 17 range. But you should probably invest in a durable case and a screen protector.\nThank you for being part of our community.

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "Dolly Parton's theme park in Tennessee - Dollywood - closed on Wednesday (May 8) due to severe weather, amidst tornados and thunderstorm in the state. The theme park and resort's X account released a statement saying that the park was closed Wednesday and reopened on Thursday (May 9). \\\"PARK UPDATE: Due to severe thunderstorms approaching Pigeon Forge this afternoon and through the evening, Dollywood will close today (Wednesday, May 8) at 4 p.m. The park will reopen on Thursday, May 9 at 10 a.m.,\\\" the park said in the post on X. PARK UPDATE: Due to severe thunderstorms approaching Pigeon Forge this afternoon and through the evening, Dollywood will close today (Wednesday, May 8) at 4 p.m. The park will reopen on Thursday, May 9 at 10 a.m.— Dollywood Parks & Resorts (@Dollywood) May 8, 2024 ]]>A top vacation destination in the US, Dollywood is ranked six in the Top 25 Amusement Park in the United States list prepared by TripAdvisor. It is ahead of Disneyland, and two other Disney properties. Moreover, official records show that Dollywood is the biggest ticketed tourist destination in Tennessee, hosting nearly 3 million tourists in a typical season.As a result, Dollywood's closure Wednesday meant that many tourists who had pre-booked tickets to visit the park could not do so on May 8. Their frustration were compounded by the fact that Dollywood did not announce any refund for those who could not visit the park due to the unexpected closure. \\\"I can’t believe Dolly Parton would let her Park be unsafe , be closed and not refund money!!!! 💰 💰💵💰💵💰💵💰💵,\\\" one user wrote on X. \\\"Wow had such a fun time spending $100 to wait at a park for 5 hours. Called a lady and she wouldn’t even give me a refund for parking. Sky looks good as soon as we leave and I’m pissed off. I got there at 10 and was there until 4 and didn’t get to ride a single ride,\\\" another posted, along with a photo of the sky. The park’s website also did not provide any information about potential refunds for tourists who had their visit cut short or couldn’t use their tickets. Under normal circumstances, Dollywood operates until 8:00 p.m. local time, meaning that the tourists lost up to four hours of their scheduled park day due to this early closure.",

    "title": "Ukrainian Forces Capture Village in Russia’s Kursk Region Amid Escalated Conflict",
    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nUkraine has intensified its drone campaign with a night-time attack on a Kremlin military airfield near Volgograd and the capture of a village in Russia’s Kursk region. The attack on the Marinovka airbase, about 45 miles west of Volgograd, occurred around 3am and involved a series of explosions. The airbase, housing approximately 30 Su-34 and Su-35 fighter jets, has been a target due to its role in bombing Ukrainian positions. The extent of damage to the jets remains unclear.\nThis operation is part of Ukraine’s broader strategy of targeting key Russian infrastructure, with over 200 targets hit recently, including oil depots and airbases. Last week, Ukraine struck airbases Borisoglebsk and Savasleyka, and earlier this week, it attacked Moscow and the Arctic Murmansk region. Despite Russian claims of downing all hostile drones, Ukraine’s persistent attacks indicate a significant escalation in its offensive.\nIn addition to the airbase attack, Ukraine has claimed control over the village of Krasno-Oktyabrskoye in the Kursk region, with ongoing battles reported. This move aims to alleviate pressure on Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces have been advancing toward key Ukrainian military hubs like Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. Russian troops are reported to be within 7 miles of Pokrovsk and 3 miles from Myrnohrad, causing evacuations and a tense atmosphere.\nOn Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the Sumy region, highlighting the reduction in shelling and civilian casualties due to the Ukrainian-controlled buffer zone. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to strike the Kursk nuclear power station, although no evidence has been provided. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed finding drone fragments near the facility and plans a visit next week.\nThe Kremlin has also targeted journalists, issuing arrest warrants for CNN reporters, including Nick Paton-Walsh, who were in the Russian town of Sudzha. This follows recent tensions over American journalists’ presence in Russia. Putin’s administration has downplayed the invasion’s impact, with over 122,000 Russians fleeing the Kursk region. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, criticized the Kremlin for ignoring the deteriorating situation and presenting the conflict as a new normal.",

    "text": "Valparaiso is taking over management of the Memorial Opera House, the 131-year-old cultural institution downtown.\nPorter County has long run the former Grand Army of the Republic Hall, which hosts plays, music, stand-up comedians and other forms of live entertainment. It’s transferring the historic performing arts venue at 104 Indiana Ave. to Valpo Parks.\nValpo Parks has more experience booking events at the nearby Central Park Plaza, which hosts a popular series of free concerts at the Northwest Health Amphitheater. It will assume the day-to-day management and operations of the Memorial Opera House.\n“We are thrilled to welcome the Memorial Opera House into the Valpo Parks family,” said Director of Parks Kevin Nuppnau. “We recognize the importance of this venue to our community and are committed to preserving its legacy while also exploring new and exciting opportunities to engage and entertain our residents and visitors.”\nPeople are also reading…\nThe current Memorial Opera House staff will stay in place. The facilities will continue to host theater productions, musicals, improvs, concerts and other cultural programming.\nPorter County just did a $5 million renovation of both the interior and exterior using American Rescue Plan Act funds. The renovations included a new HVAC system, tuckpointing, brickwork, roof repairs, remodeling of the lobby and bar and all new seats and replacing narrow worn-down seats so weathered the springs were popping out in some instances.\nThe historic venue was designed by architect Charles Lembke and built in 1893 with funds raised from townspeople to honor the Porter County soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. It was one of 592 Grand Army of the Public Memorial Halls that was built around the country.\nIt has hosted a number of notable performers, including President Theodore Roosevelt, the March King John Philip Sousa, the Marx Brothers, William Jennings Bryan, the magician Prof. Wm. M’Cormick. Valparaiso native Beulah Bondi first appeared on stage there as an 8-year-old during a production of “Little Lord Fauntleroy.” She went on to win an Emmy Award, be twice nominated for the Academy Award and starred as the mother of Jimmy Stewart’s character in the holiday classic “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\nCounty and city officials had long been interested in a transfer, thinking it was a better fit for Valpo Parks’ portfolio.\nMayor Jon Costas has said that the city has more capacity to schedule programming, market events and handle tickets sales and that it’s a one-off anomaly for the county government.\nFor more information, visit memorialoperahouse.com or call (219) 548-9137.\nNWI Business Ins and Outs: Crown Point golf simulator, furniture store, Ed Debevic’s open; Dairy Queen closes\nOpen\nNetPar Golf has teed off in Crown Point, where visitors can play virtual versions of famous courses like Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill in California, Real Club Valderrama in Spain and St. Andrew in Scotland.\n“We are a family-friendly, indoor golf simulator venue with four bays using Trackman technology,” owner Kayla Carmichael said. “We have a full bar and serve light bites. We are kicking off fall leagues, and have leagues for ladies, couples and men.”\nThe indoor golf simulator, bar and grill at 1005 Millennium Drive emerged from the coronavirus pandemic.\n“We were hooked on golf during COVID when we were locked down in the basement,” owner Hunter Carmichael said.\nBut then winter came.\n“You can’t golf year-round,” he said. “You can’t golf at night. While obviously nothing can beat a real golf course, this provides some opportunity to golf at night or when the weather doesn’t allow. It’s got great entertainment and a great bar as well.”\nJoseph S. Pete\n‘It’s pretty cool’\nThe 40-seat eatery and bar with the slogan “the golf season just got longer” serves beer, wine and liquor. It has Goose Island 312, Stella Artois, 3 Floyds, Miller Lite, Modelo and other beers on tap, as well as a selection of scotch, whiskey and gin. The food menu consists of elevated pub fare, including pulled pork nachoes, meatballs with mozzarella and Italian beef sandwiches.\nIt has 82-inch and 65-inch televisions for watching sports.\n“It would be perfect for a fantasy football or fantasy basketball draft,” Hunter Carmichael said. “People can play the same course as a tournament while it’s on TV. We’re looking at opening overnight and at non-standard hours so people can play during international tournaments like the British Open while it’s live.”\nPeople can rent out golf simulators by the hour. They’re programmed with 125 different courses from across the world that were mapped by drones and replicated.\n“This is the latest technology that every professional is practicing on,” he said. “It’s pretty cool. You can currently play on the same courses as the PGA, LPGA and European tours.”\nJoseph S. Pete\n‘From Denmark’\nNew courses are constantly added as the software is updated.\n“There are currently no courses from Indiana but there are several from Michigan and Tennessee,” he said. “It’s a firm from Denmark so there are a lot of international courses.”\nThe simulators also can be used to play games like capture the flag. Players can drive golf balls into volcanoes, from skyscraper to skyscraper or in the Old West.\nNetPar Golf employs about 10 people, including a professional from Youche Country Club who gives lessons. Customers pay an hourly rate that varies depending on the season, time of week and time of day.\nIt offers membership that gives people discounts and priority booking.\n“The partners all live in Crown Point and are mostly from this area,” Carmichael said. “We wanted to add more entertainment and fun to do in this area. If you’ve ever been somewhere like Top Golf, you’ll see that people have a blast even if they don’t golf. The technology is pretty cool to see and people have fun whether they’re playing or not. Whether you’re a golfer or a non-golfer, you can have fun in a family-friendly atmosphere. There’s good food, good drink, and good entertainment activities. We just did a birthday party because it’s a fun thing to do.”\nNetPar Golf is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.\nFor more information, visit www.netpar.golf or call 219-323-3350.\nJoseph S. Pete\nOpen\nEd Debevic’s, the iconic Chicago restaurant that serves up snark with its diner fare, is back after a hiatus of more than six years.\nThe quirky 1950s-style diner, where the servers dish out attitude along with eggs, closed its longtime location in River North in 2015. It had been there for 30 years but was razed to make way for a residential high-rise.\nThe throwback restaurant has been hunting for a new location for years and finally found one at 159 E. Ohio St. in Chicago, where it opened earlier this month after many “bumps in the road,” “mountains to climb” and “so many other cliche phrases to excuse Ed’s extended vacation.”\n“We absolutely CAN wait to serve you,” the fun-loving restaurant posted online. “Seriously, we are not looking forward to it. But we’re open, so come give us something to do.”\nJoseph S. Pete\n‘We absolutely CAN wait to serve you’\nEd Debevic’s first opened in 1984, offering a retro dining experience with wise-cracking wait staff. They embody different period characters like greasers, jocks, cheerleaders, nerds and beauty school dropouts, sometimes breaking into choreographed dance numbers on the soda counters, including of the timeless Village People hit “YMCA.”\nThe vintage decor features neon, Route 66 road signs and other nostalgic paraphernalia.\nThe restaurant serves old school diner fare like burgers, jumbo hot dogs, meatloaf, tuna salad sandwiches, cheese fries, atomic fries, milkshakes, floats, phosphate sodas, banana splits, key lime pie and the world’s smallest ice cream sundae. It has a kid’s menu and breakfast options including skillets, avocado toast and two eggs any style.\nEd Debevic’s is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday and Wednesday, from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\nFor more information, call 312-374-88499 or visit eddebevics.com .\nJoseph S. Pete\nComing soon\nFive Star Furniture is opening in the erstwhile H.H. Gregg that was formerly a Circuit City by Southlake Mall in Hobart.\nH.H. Gregg closed the store at 2757 E. 81st Ave. in Hobart in 2017 when the Indianapolis-based electronics and appliance retailer with the slogan “price and advice guaranteed” went under.\nThe local Five Star Furniture chain has stores throughout Chicagoland, including in Arlington Heights, Bridgeview, Burbank and Oak Lawn.\nIt sells furniture for the living room, bedroom, dining room, home office and outdoor patio. It also carries mattresses, accents, TV stands and entertainment centers.\nThe furniture store is now hiring.\nFor more information, call 773-600-1146 or visit www.fivestarfurniturestore.com .\nJoseph S. Pete\nClosed\nSheffield’s in Dyer closed its diner earlier this year but the attached bar now opens early to serve breakfast.\nThe restaurant and sports bar at 1027 Sheffield Ave. in Dyer serves a traditional American diner breakfast menu that includes omelets, skillets, pancakes, waffles and French toast. Specialties include biscuits and gravy, country fried steak and a country breakfast.\nThe long-standing neighborhood eatery and watering hole also has a second location in Merrillville. It set aside a nonsmoking area in the sports bar in Dyer for breakfast patrons.\nJoseph S. Pete\nRelocated\nKennedy Avenue Chiropractic and Integrated Body and Medicine has moved from Hammond to Highland.\nThe business is now located at 8145 Kennedy Aven. in Highland. The practice offers a variety of health and wellness services, including chiropractic care, physical therapy, massage therapy, weight loss guidance, athletic wellness and personal injury. Dr. Ahmad Sprouse adjusts and aligns patients’ spines while offering a holistic approach toward pain and health issues that includes advice on diet, exercise and lifestyle.\nFor more information, call 219-803-6651 or visit www.kennedyavechiro.com .\nJoseph S. Pete\nTemporarily closed\nThe Dairy Queen in Lowell closed temporarily on Saturday for a remodeling.\nThe soft-serve ice cream restaurant was founded in Joliet in 1940 and is now owned by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, with more than 6,800 locations across the world. A staple of many Midwestern childhoods, it’s known for its Blizzards, Dilly Bars and other sweet treats.\nThe Dairy Queen at 1805 E. Commercial Ave. in Lowell will be closed for at least eight weeks during the construction.\nIf you would like your business to be included in a future column, email joseph.pete@nwi.com .\nJoseph S.
