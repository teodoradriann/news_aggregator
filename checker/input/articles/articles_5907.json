    "text": "Growing up in South Carolina my whole life, whenever there’s supposed to be a day where temperatures get below freezing, the whole town shuts down. I’m talking about school and business closures left and right, and you can’t walk into a grocery store without the bread and milk aisles being completely ransacked. However, if you live up north, I’m sure a snowy day below freezing is just like any other regular day. In fact, apparently the news stations send out the traffic team for a ride around to discuss the road situation on bad weather days. That appears to be what was going on when FOX29 Philadelphia’s traffic anchor Bob Kelly made the discovery of his life. While Kelly was discussing the road conditions while riding shotgun in the FOX29 vehicle, he noticed that there was one business open… And I’m talking about Lamb’s Beverage, a drive-thru beer and liquor store that you can just pull up to and request what you want. Judging by Kelly’s reaction, you would’ve thought he had just hit the lottery. You can hear him say: “Oh what is this here? Hold on… Is this a drive-thru beer distributor? … You know we’ve been drinking coffee for most of the morning, I’ve gotta get some supplies for later on. So some businesses are open… Lamb’s Beverage, 8 AM to 8 PM Monday through Thursday. They’re ready to go so I’ll bring back some cold ones for you guys how does that sound? … I’ve never seen one of these, you actually don’t even have to get out of your car.” You would’ve thought this guy was in hawg Heaven driving up to this place. Personally, I’ve never seen one of these places either, and I think this needs to start to become a common trend.

    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "text": "Sony Ult Field 3 wireless speaker review: let's party\nSony's portable speaker has a lot going for it\nThe Ult Field 3 is a great competitor against the JBL Charge 6 and other durable all-weather speakers. It delivers great sound, in a lovely design, although it isn't the cheapest option in the genre. All in all, Sony's portable is a great new option that'll win fans with ease.\n-\n+\nNice, simple design\n-\n+\nGreat sound\n-\n+\nIP67 rating for durability\n-\n-\nA bit heavy for its size\n-\n-\nNeed Ult mode for bass\n-\n-\nStrap is fiddly\nWhy you can trust T3\nFind out more about how we test.\nReviews\nSony's Ult lineup is maturing nicely. After launching the new sub-brand of speakers in 2024, Sony is adding more models all the time. One of the most attractive recent additions is the Ult Field 3, on review here. There are both bigger and smaller options in the Ult line, but I think this one might be the most sensible size for most people.\nIt's big enough to stand alone happily in big spaces, but small enough to remain portable – all with a classy and sleek design. How does it hold up to actual use, though, and is it one of the best Bluetooth speakers going? I carted it around for a couple of weeks to establish just that – so read on for my detailed thoughts.\nPrice & Availability\nThe Ult Field 3 is available now and can be picked up from a wide range of retailers. It comes in at £159 / $199.99 / €199, which makes it sit in roughly the mid-range where portable speakers are concerned. This isn't a super-compact speaker, so it isn't competing on getting the price down as low as possible.\nDesign & Features\nSony's Ult lineup has some chunkier, more 'shouty' speakers, but I think the Field 3 is one of, or perhaps the single nicest-looking speaker in the whole range. It's oblong in shape, with a mesh grille covering the majority of the body. There are small feet to keep it the right way up, too.\nOn each end of that oblong, you'll find large apertures for some of its drivers, while the top of the speaker holds the main controls. There's a power button, a couple of pairing buttons (one for Bluetooth, the other for connecting to other Ult speakers), play/pause, volume keys, and a large Ult button for boosted bass.\nOn either side of these controls, there's a small rubber flap you can lift to gain access to hooks that let you attach an included carrying strap. That process can be a little fiddly, but once they're on, they feel very secure.\nThe back of the speaker, meanwhile, hides another rubber flap with the USB-C charging port behind it, along with a battery button for maintenance use (I think – I couldn't find any evidence for what it does).\nThe whole thing is accented by a single, quite large Sony logo in reflective metal on he speaker's front, and makes for a really attractive picture overall. You can pick it up in black, green or off white, depending on your taste.\nThe fabric is durable enough to leave me relaxed about handling it roughly – it's very similar to the outside of something like the UE Wonderboom 4.\nThat durability isn't just an appearance, either. The speaker has a water and dust resistance rating of IP67, which means it's impervious to dust, and resistant to water up to a metre of immersion for 30 minutes. That's more than enough to ensure this is a genuinely hardy speaker you can rely on in all weather.\nBattery life is stated at up to 24 hours, and there's fast-charging to get a couple of hours from just 10 minutes plugged in. Those are impressive numbers, and should make it something you can take on camping trips or for all-day outings without any anxiety.\nThe 'Ult button' I mentioned earlier is the signature of the Ult range, and basically acts as a big boost to the bass levels in your tracks, balancing them for a punchier feeling that tends to perform better in outdoor situations. It's a handy shortcut, but Sony's app also lets you edit a seven-band equaliser (EQ) to your taste.\nIf you pick up two Ult Field 3 speakers, you can pair them for stereo sound, meanwhile, but you can also connect one to a range of other Ult speakers to more simply boost your output from more than one speaker at a time.\nPerformance & Battery Life\nSo, how does the speaker actually sound? Well, the answer is that it's perfectly impressive – boomingly loud for its size when pushed to the limits of its volume, with enough detail to ensure that you're not just listening to bass noise.\nThe speaker's Ult mode feels like a must to experiment with once you get it, especially if you're listening out of doors, where soundstages can be harder to establish even for great speakers. It adds some real oomph to the low-end, but thankfully doesn't blow things out of balance (which some other Ult speakers can suffer).\nIf you do crank the volume right to the top, though, you'll start to notice that detail deteriorate a little – which isn't anything uncommon for a portable speaker, but is worth bearing in mind.\nOne further wrinkle to all this, though, is that the Ult mode is so persuasive that it almost always needs to be on for this particular speaker. That slightly begs the question of whether it should even be a \"mode\" at all – shouldn't it just be the default tuning for the speaker? The fact that you can't tune the Ult mode at all (any EQ tweaks disable the mode) is a real shame, too.\nStill, this size and weight (1.20kg) do feel pretty perfect for a chunky portable speaker, and the sound quality is easily good enough to make it a great pick for outdoor events where you want some fun tunes but don't need to drown out everyone's ability to speak to each other.\nI found the Bluetooth connectivity to be rock-solid, while battery life lined up with Sony's claims. Those claims are impressive, though, so entire-day battery shouldn't be overlooked as an impressive boast. That said, if you use the aforementioned Ult mode, this does shrink the battery life down by around 10 hours, which is worth knowing about.\nSony Ult Field 3 review: Verdict\nThe Ult Field 3 is probably the Ult speaker I'd buy right now – chunkier and more powerful than the Ult Field 1, but not as off-puttingly large as the more expensive models in the range.\nStill, it has some drawbacks at a pretty steep price. The sound quality is heavily dependent on that Ult mode, and reliance on it makes for a lack of customisation options at the level I'd like.\nThe Sony Ult Field 3 has got a great design, though, and for those looking to keep things simple it still stands as a good option.\nAlso consider\nAt this price, there's a lot of competition for the Ult Field 3 to deal with. If rugged portability is your priority, the slightly older JBL Charge 6 matches Sony on every level, and has a deservedly impressive reputation.\nFor those who've already got some Sonos speakers in their home, though, extending that system with a Roam 2 might be the smoothest option. It, too, comes in cheaper than Sony's speaker, underlining the fierce sector of the market we're in.\nGet all the latest news, reviews, deals and buying guides on gorgeous tech, home and active products from the T3 experts\nMax is T3's Staff Writer for the Tech section – with years of experience reporting on tech and entertainment.

    "text": "Jon Stewart Helps Raise $25K for Shelter Where He Found Late Dog Dipper [Jon Stewart](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-stewart/)’s touching [Daily Show](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-stewart-is-returning-to-host-the-daily-show/) tribute to his pit bull Dipper went viral this week, leaving adults and children alike in tears as Stewart honored his best friend. Animal Haven, the no-kill animal shelter where Stewart, his family, and Dipper first united, has raised over $25,000 since that segment aired, executive director Tiffany Lacey [told TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2024/02/29/jon-stewart-animal-shelter-raise-donations-daily-show-tribute-dog-dies/) in an article published on Thursday, February 29. “In a world of good boys, he was the best,” Stewart, 61, said of the three-legged Dipper during the Monday, February 26, episode of The Daily Show. “Dipper passed away yesterday. He was ready. He was tired, but I wasn’t. And the family, we were all together.” In the tribute, Stewart did his best to hold back tears as he recounted how he first met Dipper. That moment came 12 years ago when his kids had the idea to raise money for Animal Haven. They baked cupcakes, setting up a table outside the shelter to sell them. The shelter bought into the idea and carried out the puppy, who had lost a leg after being hit by a car. They named him Dipper. [Vanessa Hudgens and More Stars Share Cute Pics With Beloved Pets](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/celebs-with-their-pets-20131211/) The Stewart family’s new pet soon became part of The Daily Show’s “OG dog crew,” even waiting for Stewart in-studio to finish taping the night’s episode. “He met actors and authors and presidents and kings,” Stewart recalled. “And he did what the Taliban could not do, which is put a scare into Malala Yousafzai.” The Daily Show then rolled a clip of Yousafzai encountering Dipper in a hallway. “Oh, dear, it’s a dog,” she could be heard saying as she stopped, turned and quickly headed in the other direction. Animal Haven says the funds it raised came from over 500 donors and will go toward “general care of their animals, plus operating support, vet care, food, staff time and dog walks.” [Whoopi! Ellen! NPH! Oscar Hosts Through the Years](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/oscar-hosts-through-the-years-whoopi-ellen-kevin-hart/) It seems the timing couldn’t be better. TMZ reports that Animal Haven is at full capacity, housing over 100 rescue animals, including 20 puppies just born to three dog moms. Lacey added that Stewart’s tribute has led to several individuals contacting the shelter to express interest in adoption and others purchasing items on Animal Haven’s Amazon wish list, including dog treats and blankets. Stewart ended his tribute with a hope for his viewers: “My wish for you is one day you find that dog, that one dog.” If Animal Haven’s report is any indication, that viral clip just made it a whole lot more likely.",

    "title": "Mental Health Days: Understanding Their Importance and Implementation",
    "text": "In today's rapidly evolving corporate landscape, the pursuit of success often leaves professionals feeling like they're constantly on the run. This relentless pace can inadvertently lead to a neglect of one's mental health, ultimately diminishing productivity, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. To address these challenges, more companies are recognizing the significance of mental health days as an essential component of their corporate wellness initiatives.\nThe Significance of Mental Health Days\nMental health days are not mere excuses for taking a day off; they are powerful tools for promoting and maintaining good mental health. Here's a more in-depth look at why mental health days matter:\n1. Stress Mitigation\nChronic workplace stress is a pervasive issue, affecting countless professionals across industries. The toll it takes on mental and physical health is undeniable, contributing to conditions like anxiety, depression, and even heart problems. Taking a mental health day allows employees to step away from their daily stressors, relax, and reset. This reset significantly reduces stress levels, helping to prevent long-term health issues.\n2. Rejuvenated Productivity\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but taking time off to focus on mental health can lead to increased productivity in the long run. When employees are well-rested and emotionally balanced, they are better equipped to handle their workloads efficiently. Reduced stress and burnout result in fewer mistakes, improved focus, and greater overall productivity.\n3. Creative Inspiration and Problem-Solving\nMental health days offer individuals the opportunity to recharge and clear their minds. This mental clarity often leads to enhanced creativity and improved problem-solving skills. The benefits extend beyond the individual, benefiting the company as a whole through innovative solutions and fresh perspectives.\n4. Enhanced Work-Life Balance\nMaintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for long-term career satisfaction. Mental health days encourage employees to prioritize self-care and well-being, making it easier for them to strike a harmonious balance between their professional and personal lives.\nStrategies for Effective Implementation\nUnderstanding the importance of mental health days is just the first step. Now, let's explore how companies can implement them effectively:\n1. Cultivate a Stigma-Free Environment\nFoster a workplace culture that promotes open and honest conversations about mental health. Employees should feel safe discussing their mental well-being without fearing judgment or potential repercussions.\n2. Define Clear Policies\nEstablish transparent policies regarding mental health days. Ensure that employees understand how to request these days, how frequently they can take them, and any required documentation or procedures.\n3. Embrace Flexible Scheduling\nEncourage employees to take mental health days without necessitating them to specify the reason. This flexibility reduces the stigma associated with mental health and fosters a culture of trust within the organization.\n4. Provide Access to Resources\nOffer employees access to resources for managing their mental health effectively. This might include Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), counseling services, wellness initiatives, or even mindfulness programs to help them navigate stressors.\n5. Champion Self-Care Practices\nPromote self-care practices as an integral part of everyday life, not just on designated mental health days. Encourage employees to prioritize activities that help them relax, recharge, and maintain good mental health.\nSeeking Expert Assistance\nImplementing an effective mental health program requires careful planning and expertise. Many organizations find it beneficial to enlist wellness consulting services to help them develop and sustain robust wellness initiatives. One such expert in the field is , a trusted provider of wellness consulting services.\n specializes in tailoring wellness programs to meet the unique needs and challenges of each organization.

    "text": "Na última segunda-feira (23), a Prefeitura de Londrina oficializou a doação de pistolas Taurus modelo 58 HC Plus, calibre 380, para a Prefeitura de Apucarana. Os armamentos serão destinados ao uso exclusivo da Guarda Municipal daquele município. A incorporação ao patrimônio da Donatária segue a legislação vigente, com o objetivo de serem utilizados em treinamento e no aperfeiçoamento das atividades operacionais da corporação.\nAdquiridos pela Prefeitura de Londrina em 2012, os armamentos doados já desempenharam papel fundamental no trabalho diário das equipes da Guarda Municipal de Londrina ao longo dos últimos anos. As pistolas estão em perfeitas condições, mas com a chegada de mais equipamentos, elas foram substituídas por modelos mais novos. E, em vez de manter as armas em estoque e sem utilidade, a prefeitura preferiu apoiar o município vizinho que começou recentemente a armar sua guarda, fortalecendo as ações de segurança pública em Apucarana.\nDurante o evento de entrega, que aconteceu na sede da Associação dos Municípios do Vale do Ivaí, no centro de Apucarana, o prefeito de Londrina, Marcelo Belinati, destacou a importância do trabalho realizado pelas forças de segurança municipais e reforçou o compromisso da administração em oferecer as melhores condições para a atuação das guardas municipais. “Cabe a nós, agentes públicos, dar as condições para que vocês possam proteger suas vidas, proteger os cidadãos e exercer melhor suas funções. Meu respeito e admiração a todas as forças de segurança. Vocês colocam suas próprias vidas em risco para cuidar da vida de outras pessoas”, afirmou.\nO secretário municipal de Defesa Social de Londrina, Coronel Pedro Ramos, enfatizou a necessidade de garantir condições adequadas para as guardas municipais desempenharem suas funções. “Para a sociedade, não interessa a cor da farda, interessa que ela está sendo atendida. E, para isso, é fundamental dar condições de trabalho aos profissionais. Essa doação de armamentos faz parte do compromisso de Londrina em apoiar guardas municipais que ainda não estavam armadas, como Apucarana. O armamento é uma ferramenta essencial para que esses profissionais possam desempenhar sua missão com segurança e eficiência. ” Ramos destacou ainda que os armamentos doados são de calibre policial, adequados para situações que exigem contenção de ameaças, e que a Guarda Municipal de Apucarana já passou pela devida qualificação e procedimentos junto à Polícia Federal para o porte e uso das armas.\nO prefeito de Apucarana, Sebastião Martins Júnior, agradeceu a doação e destacou o trabalho dedicado da Guarda Municipal de sua cidade. “Nossa guarda enfrenta situações extremamente desafiadoras e cumpre um papel essencial no apoio às forças de segurança, como a Patrulha Maria da Penha e diversas outras frentes. Tenho muito orgulho do trabalho realizado por esses homens e mulheres, que não medem esforços para proteger a população. Essa doação reforça ainda mais a capacidade de atuação da nossa guarda”, frisou.G\nA cerimônia contou com a participação de representantes da Guarda Municipal de Arapongas, da Polícia Militar, do Exército Brasileiro, do Conselho Municipal de Segurança de Apucarana e de vereadores da cidade.\nLeia também:\n[\nPolícia investiga se adolescente foi morto por engano na madrugada de Natal em Londrina\nA Polícia Civil investiga se Gabriel Fernando dos Santos de Lima, de 17 anos, foi executado por engano na madrugada de Natal, na quarta-feira (25), no distrito de Irerê, região sul de Londrina.\n](https://www.bonde.com.br/bondenews/policia/policia-investiga-se-adolescente-foi-morto-por-engano-na-madrugada-de-natal-em-londrina)",
