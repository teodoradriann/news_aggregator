    "title": "Canada Women’s Soccer Head Coach Priestman Suspended Amid Drone Scandal | The Epoch Times",
    "text": "The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) removed head coach Bev Priestman on Thursday following her suspension by Canada Soccer over a drone spying scandal that has thrust the 2020 Olympic gold medalists into an unsavory global spotlight. The Canadian women’s squad will be led by assistant coach Andy Spence for the remainder of the Paris games, the COC said. “Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said in an emailed statement. “In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women’s National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.” Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 in their Paris Olympics opening game on Thursday, a match which Priestman voluntarily sat out after the spying scandal broke this week. A drone flown by a Canada Soccer staff member disrupted a New Zealand training session on Monday just days ahead of their opening match against the Tokyo 2020 gold medalists. Priestman apologised to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her. “This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.” Global soccer’s governing body FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, and two Canada Soccer staff members that were booted from the Paris games this week over the scandal. Canada Soccer said Wednesday it would launch an independent external review about the drone incident and the historical culture of competitive ethics within all of its programs. Canada Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for additional comment. The Canadian women are scheduled to take on Group A opponent France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne.",

    "text": "I have experienced a sinus infection on several occasions. It is one of the most uncomfortable and miserable conditions to get, especially during the busy holiday season. The pressure is almost always accompanied with a bad headache and even a fever.\nWhen the inflammation of the mucous membranes become infected, the discomfort is almost unbearable at times. When you have a sinus infection, trying to sleep becomes very difficult due to blocked airways. This causes so much dull pain and tension between the eyes. No thank you!\nHaving this all-natural sinus mix at the ready gives me peace of mind. I know that when I feel the onset of a sinus infection, I can start applying this infection fighter. I quickly feel the relief and pressure start subsiding. Since it is all natural, I can use it as often as I need it. I hope you love it as much as I do.\nIngredients\n- 5 drops peppermint essential oil\n- 5 drops eucalyptus essential oil\n- 5 drops rosemary essential oil\n- 5 drops geranium essential oil\n- Almond oil or any other carrier oil of your choice\nEquipment\n- 1 10-ml glass roller bottle (Amazon.com carries them)\nInstructions\n1. Gather your ingredients and the glass roller bottle.\n2. Remove the roller from the bottle. Now add the essential oils.\n3. Fill the rest of the bottle with almond oil or the carrier oil of your choice.\n4. Replace the roller. Make sure to shake really well before each use.\nRoll the mix over your sinuses, forehead and under your eyes. Be careful not to get any in your eyes. If you do, just add a little almond oil (or any other oil) and it will dilute the essential oils. If you use water, it will make it worse because water and essential oils do not mix.\nUse this roller blend as often as you need in order to get some relief from the pressure of the sinus infection.\n— Leilani Hampton",

    "text": "Can You Glue Anemones? A Comprehensive Guide Absolutely not! You cannot, and should not, glue an anemone . Attempting to glue an anemone to a rock or any other surface is almost certain to cause severe stress and is very likely to kill it. These delicate creatures rely on their ability to move to find optimal conditions within your aquarium, and gluing them down removes this essential capability. Now that we’ve established that, let’s delve deeper into why this is the case and explore safer, more effective alternatives.\nUnderstanding Anemone Attachment Anemones are fascinating invertebrates equipped with a basal disc , a specialized adhesive foot that allows them to attach to surfaces. However, this attachment is not permanent like glue. They can detach and reattach as needed to find areas with the right flow, lighting, and food availability .\nThe Dangers of Gluing Gluing an anemone presents several critical issues:\nToxicity: Most commonly available adhesives, including super glue (cyanoacrylate), can be toxic to anemones, especially when applied directly to their tissue. Tissue Damage: The application process itself can damage the anemone’s sensitive tissues, leading to infection and necrosis. Restricted Movement: By fixing the anemone in place, you prevent it from seeking out its preferred environment, leading to stress, poor health, and eventual death. Safe Alternatives for Securing Anemones So, if gluing is a no-go, how do you ensure your anemone stays where you want it, or at least within a reasonable area of your tank? Here are a few proven methods:\nThe Tupperware Method This is a popular and effective technique:\nTake a Tupperware bowl (approximately 6 inches in height) and place a decent-sized rock at the bottom. Carefully place the anemone inside the bowl, positioning it near the rock. Place the bowl in a medium flow area of your tank. Wait a day or two. The anemone will usually attach itself to the rock. Once attached, carefully remove the rock and anemone from the bowl and place them in your desired location. Strategic Placement Consider these factors when choosing a location for your anemone:\nLighting: Bubble Tip Anemones (BTAs), for example, need moderate to higher lighting (between 220-350 PAR). Flow: Anemones generally prefer moderate water flow , which helps them filter feed. Stability: Provide a stable base, such as a rock crevice or a slightly recessed area, to encourage the anemone to stay put. Timing is Key Introduce the anemone at the beginning of your light cycle . This allows it to acclimate and find a suitable spot while the lights are on. Introducing it right before lights out often triggers it to move in search of light. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Anemones 1. Why does my anemone keep moving? Anemones are naturally mobile creatures. They move to find the perfect combination of lighting, flow, and food availability . Changes in water parameters or the introduction of new tank mates can also trigger movement.\n2. What kind of water conditions do anemones need? Anemones thrive in pristine water conditions . Aim for:\nLow to no debris High oxygen levels Stable pH of around 8.2 Steady temperature of around 77°F (25°C) 3. What is the lifespan of an anemone? Anemones are remarkably long-lived. Some species can live for 100 years or more in the wild!\n4. How do I know if my anemone is healthy? A healthy anemone will have:\nA closed mouth (an open or gaping mouth can indicate stress) Bright, vibrant color A firmly attached base 5. How do I feed my anemone? While anemones can obtain some nutrients from the water and through photosynthesis (if they host symbiotic algae), they also benefit from supplemental feeding . Offer small pieces of meaty foods like mysis shrimp, brine shrimp, or finely chopped seafood.\n6. What are the easiest anemones to keep? The Bubble Tip Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) is generally considered one of the easiest anemones for beginners, but they still require proper care and attention to water parameters and lighting.\n7. Do anemones feel pain? While anemones lack a centralized brain, the question of whether invertebrates feel pain is complex and debated. They react to stimuli, but the extent to which they experience “pain” in a way similar to mammals is unknown. Regardless, minimize any potential stress or harm to these animals.\n8. What do anemones attach to? Anemones naturally attach to rocks, crevices, shells, and other suitable surfaces in their environment.\n9. How do I stop my anemone from dying? To prevent anemone death:\nEnsure proper lighting and flow . Maintain excellent water quality through regular water changes and adequate filtration. Provide supplemental feeding . Address any underlying issues promptly. 10. Why do clownfish wiggle in anemones? Clownfish wiggle and twirl within the anemone’s tentacles to increase water flow and oxygen levels around the anemone. This behavior is also part of their symbiotic relationship, where the anemone provides protection and the clownfish helps keep it clean.\n11. What kind of anemone do clownfish like? While clownfish can host with various anemone species, Ocellaris clownfish readily accept the Bubble Tip Anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) .\n12. How do I know if my anemone is hungry? Signs of hunger in anemones can include:\nStringy tentacles A deflated appearance Lack of feeding response 13. How big will my anemone get? The size of an anemone depends on the species and environmental conditions. Some anemones can grow quite large, reaching a foot or more in diameter.\n14. Do anemones multiply? Yes, anemones can reproduce both sexually (spawning) and asexually (binary fission). Asexual division is more common in aquariums.\n15. What do I do with a dead anemone? A dead anemone can severely pollute your tank. If you suspect your anemone has died:\nVerify it’s truly dead by observing for any signs of life and checking for a foul odor. Turn off wave pumps to prevent further dispersal of toxins. Remove as much of the anemone as possible using a fish net. Siphon out all traces of anemone flesh and particles from the tank. Use mechanical filtration to trap any remaining particles, cleaning the filter regularly. Final Thoughts Keeping anemones can be a rewarding experience, but it requires dedication and a thorough understanding of their needs. By avoiding harmful practices like gluing and focusing on creating a stable and supportive environment, you can help your anemone thrive for years to come.

Por Canal26 Jueves 7 de Noviembre de 2024 - 19:00 Algunos [alimentos](https://www.canal26.com/bienestar-y-salud/un-estudio-confirmo-cual-es-la-vitamina-que-aumenta-la-esperanza-de-vida-en-que-alimentos-se-encuentra--398516), además de deleitar paladares, también aportan beneficios a la salud. Según investigaciones que realizó un neurólogo estadounidense, existen ciertos tipos de quesos que ayudan a fortalecer la mente y a mejorar la salud cognitiva en general. El Dr. Mill Etienne, profesor asociado de Neurología en el New York Medical College, recomendó comer algunos tipos de quesos para beneficiar la memoria a medida que envejecemos. En entrevista con el sitio Aol, el médico especialista remarcó que elegir quesos bajos en grasas es muy importante, ya que el exceso de grasas aumenta el riesgo de sufrir demencia. Entre los quesos recomendados se encuentran: También hay quesos que contienen ácido linoleico conjugado (CLA), como el queso azul, edam y suizo, que aportan propiedades antiinflamatorias que ayudan a proteger las funciones cognitivas. Por otra parte, para las personas que no toleran la lactosa existen opciones como el queso suizo, parmesano y feta de leche de cabra u oveja, que son más fáciles de digerir y no pierden los beneficios para el cerebro. Por otro lado, la neurocirujana Betsy Grunch, integrante del American College of Surgeons (Colegio Americano de Cirujanos), advirtió sobre los efectos negativos que presentan los quesos procesados, como el Velveeta y el Cheese-whiz. Estos alimentos podrían contener la enzima diacetilo, que puede afectar la memoria y aumentar el riesgo de enfermedades cerebrovasculares.

    "text": "Flood Watch for NJ: Heavy rain and wind to disrupt weekend plans The Bottom Line Friday will be dry. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday too. But Saturday is going to be a nasty, inclement weather day for New Jersey, as a potent coastal storm swings in. By the numbers, 2 to 3 inches of rain, 40 mph wind gusts, and localized minor coastal flooding are on the table. Raising concerns for flooding and travel difficulties. Many outdoor events are already activating their backup plans and rain dates, and with good reason. I do not see much hope for any pockets of substantially dry weather between sunrise and sunset on Saturday. Friday It is a cold and dry start to Friday, which will have you reaching for the coat and Chap Stick. Temperatures have fallen into the 20s for the vast majority of New Jersey. The only spot starting the day above freezing is the Jersey Shore. You will want the sunglasses early on Friday too, as sunshine dominates through the morning. By mid-afternoon, clouds will start to roll in. High temperatures on Friday will reach the mid 40s or so. Still on the cool side of normal. But at least the wind will be much lighter and more comfortable, compared to Thursday. As skies become cloudy Friday evening, rain should hold off until Midnight or later. That will be the start of 18 to 24 hours of wet, stormy weather. Saturday Wet, wet, wet. And windy too. Is there any hope of substantial periods of dry weather on Saturday? Not really. I am calling it a washout, with moderate to heavy rain from sunrise to sunset. Total rainfall will likely reach about 2 to 3 inches for most of New Jersey. If a corner of the state misses all heavy rain bands, it may end up close to an inch. Meanwhile, a real downpour could push totals closer to 4 inches. I do not want to get specific about the geography — who is going to see the most rainfall — since the axis of wettest weather changes with every model run. Bottom line: No matter where you are, a lot of water will be falling from the sky Saturday. Saturday could become the wettest calendar day of 2024 so far. And that is significant, since we have had some real soakers this winter. A Flood Watch has been issued for the entire state of New Jersey, in effect from early Saturday morning through early Sunday morning. Flooding and ponding — i.e. big puddles — may necessitate road closures. In addition, wind gusts may exceed 40 mph at times. Rumbles of thunder are possible too. The coastal flooding picture looks better, but I could see localized minor category flooding issues, especially late Saturday into Sunday. The chance of wintry weather is still practically zero — this is a wind and rain machine. As rain exits the Garden State early Saturday evening, around dinnertime, skies should clear quickly. While a light freeze is possible by Sunday morning, icing seems unlikely. Sunday That coastal storm system will still be spinning over the Atlantic Ocean, potentially keeping lingering clouds over the Jersey Shore. Farther inland, Sunday should turn bright and sunny. It will be breezy and dry Sunday, with high temperatures on either side of 50 degrees. Monday Monday's forecast looks quite pleasant, with sunshine, dry weather, and seasonable-to-mild high temperatures pushing into the mid 50s. The Extended Forecast Tuesday stays quiet, with increasing clouds and highs in the 50s. Our next storm system will be a cold front, forecast to deliver showers and clouds on Wednesday. Still no significant warmup in sight, through the end of March. No wintry weather either. Just status quo, near-normal weather punctuated by occasional rounds of rain.
