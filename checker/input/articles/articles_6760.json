    "text": "Lo había intentado en el primer tiempo y no tuvo éxito, pero en la segunda oportunidad que tuvo no falló:\n[Matheus Cunha](/futbol/jugador/_/id/259902/matheus-cunha) metió un golazo olímpico y fue el protagonista de la victoria de [Wolverhampton](/futbol/equipo/_/id/380/wolverhampton-wanderers) 2-0 sobre [Manchester United](/futbol/equipo/_/id/360/manchester-united) por la fecha 18 de la Premier League.\nEl mediocampista braisleño de los Wolves había sido el jugador más destacado de un primer tiempo de vuelo bajo. Cunha fue el más activo, creativo y quien generó más riesgo en esa etapa en la que la niebla sobresalió más que el juego en el estadio Molineux.\nWolverhampton, que llegaba a este duelo del Boxing Day luego de una contundente victoria 3-0 sobre Leicester tras una racha negativa de cuatro derrotas seguidas, fue el equipo que más propuso, aunque sin muchas opciones claras de gol: apenas un cabezazo de Jorgen Strand Larsen que encontró una buena reacción de André Onana y un remate de Nélson Semedo que se fue cerca del palo. Además del primer intento de Cunha de meterla directo al arco desde el córner, algo que le sirvió de ensayo para el magnífico gol que abrió el marcador.\nManchester United acumuló su tercera caída consecutiva -ante Tottenham por la Carabo Cup y frente a Bournemouth por la Premier-, luego del triunfo ante Manchester City en el derbi.\nEl equipo de Rúben Amorim tuvo muy poca claridad. En la etapa inicial solo generó peligro con un remate esquinado de Diogo Dalot, contestado por una gran atajada de José Sá en el duelo de portugueses, y un cabezazo débil de Lisandro Martínez, el mejor jugador de los Diablos Rojos.\nY esa escasez de juego se acentuó con la expulsión de Bruno Fernandes, quien había sido amonestado en la primera etapa y apenas iniciado el segundo tiempo le dio una patada a Semedo y vio la tarjeta roja. Con la salida del portugués, Manchester United resignó sus posibilidades de crear acciones de riesgo sobre el arco rival.\nA la desventaja en cantidad de jugadores le siguió la peor noticia para los Diablos Rojos a los 58 minutos: el fantástico gol de Cunha que dejó sin reacción al arquero visitante, atrapado entre el irlandés Matthew Doherty y el uruguayo Santiago Bueno.\n[Manchester United ya había sufrido un gol olímpico, cortesía de Son Heung-Min](/futbol/inglaterra/nota/_/id/14584856/el-gol-olimpico-de-son-que-le-dio-la-clasificacion-a-tottenham-ante-manchester-united-en-copa-de-la-liga), una semana antes en la eliminación de la Carabao Cup frente a Tottenham.\nY Matheus Cunha convirtió así su décimo gol del campeonato. Diez goles para un jugador que tuvo una actuación merecedora de una indiscutible calificación: 10 puntos para la gran figura del partido.\nPara sentenciar la historia, mientras Manchester United intentaba con Alejandro Garnacho, quien ingresó muy tarde en el partido, a los 99 minutos Wolverhampton concretó un contraataque sobre el final: Cunha habilitó a Hee-Chan Hwang y el surcoreano definió en soledad para el 2-0.",

    "published": "2023-12-24T00:00:00Z",
    "title": "Sowing Seeds of Good Fortune Among Thorns | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Falun Dafa practitioners are willing to face persecution from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in order to save people’s souls by telling them the truth of Falun Dafa (also called Falun Gong). I wish to share several stories of people’s lives being changed for the better because they accepted the truth when a practitioner told them about the goodness of Falun Dafa. A Peasant Woman’s Fortunate Encounter with Dafa I am 72 years old and started practicing Falun Dafa in 2004. I grew up in a rural area and my health was very poor due to the hard work I faced daily. My first husband passed away early. My eldest son served in the army for three years, and was assigned to work in a small city. Seeing that my health was rapidly declining, he helped me move into the city to receive better medical treatment. He took me to the hospital, where I was diagnosed with cholecystitis, hepatomegaly, gastroptosis, osteoporosis, and low immunity. The doctor said that these ailments were all related to my digestive system. Therefore he did not recommend hospitalization, but gave me medicine to take at home, and told me the regimen I needed to follow. From then on, I took medicine every day, and I was not allowed to eat anything solid. I mostly ate porridge. I became thinner and thinner, as my weight dropped from 132 lbs to 79 lbs. At that time, I felt that I was not only suffering badly, but I was also hurting my family. I really did not want to live any longer. My fate took a turn just as I started to despair. I was introduced to a retired official, and we got married in 2004. One day, my husband’s colleague, a Falun Dafa practitioner, came to see us. She asked me if I knew about Falun Dafa, and I told her that I didn’t. She said, “Falun Dafa is so wonderful. It teaches people to become good people, and it also cures illnesses and is great for one’s health. I had many illnesses in the past and I recovered from all of them after I practiced Falun Dafa.” My eyes lit up, and I asked, “Really? Please tell me how to do the exercises!” She said, “I will give you a book tomorrow. You can read that first.” The next day, she brought me the book Zhuan Falun, the main book of Falun Dafa. When I turned to the first page, I saw Master’s photo [Master Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Dafa]. It felt as if I was seeing a long-lost relative, and tears covered my face. The second night after I began to read Zhuan Falun, I had diarrhea and spent the whole night in the bathroom. I also had a fever of 42 degrees. My husband’s colleague explained to me, “Master is taking care of you and cleansing your body.” I indeed felt that it was different this time, because when I had diarrhea in the past, I would be so weak and would have to stay in bed. But this time, I was still very energetic. I was very happy and also surprised. I had not even officially practiced Falun Dafa yet, and had only read a few pages of Zhuan Falun. However, Master was already taking care of me and cleansing my body, just as described in the book. My husband used to practice Dafa before the CCP launched its persecution in July 1999. But after the persecution began, all his Falun Dafa books were illegally confiscated, and he stopped practicing. He got sick again, and medical treatment didn’t help. We practiced the exercises together. At that time, I didn’t know what cultivation was. I was just grateful to Master for adjusting my health and giving me a new life. I then kept hearing a voice saying, “Think about it, everyone: What kind of matter is it to teach qigong toward high levels? Isn’t this offering salvation to humankind? Offering salvation to humankind means that you will be truly cultivating, and not just healing illnesses and keeping fit.” (Lecture One, [Zhuan Falun](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/zfl2014/zfl_2014_1.html)) I looked behind me and all around, but didn’t see anyone. Later on, I read this passage in Zhuan Falun, and only then did I realize that it was Master who was enlightening me. He was telling me that cultivation is not just about getting rid of illnesses and keeping fit. My husband is a chauvinist. He controlled all of our money, and would not give me any to spend, which made me very angry. But since I practiced Dafa, I could not argue with him or fight him. I was suffocated by anger inside, and I shed tears in bed under the covers at night. When I got up in the morning, I saw a big hand holding a brown wooden plate with a bowl of rice on it, and it was offered to me. I then heard Master’s voice, “You will be okay as long as you have something to eat.” I immediately cried. I knew that I made Master worry about me. From then on, I no longer cared about money and was happy every day. I Fell Down When I Was 70 I fell when riding my bicycle in the summer of 2021. I was on the ground and it took me a while to realize what had happened. I immediately thought to myself, “I’m okay,” and quickly got up. I pushed my bicycle and walked home. I then felt bad all over again and decided to lie in bed. The next day, I couldn’t get up. My whole body was numb and I couldn’t move. My three sons were frightened, fearing that I would became paralyzed. They insisted on taking me to the hospital for an examination. I told them, “I am a Dafa practitioner, and I will be fine. The hospital can’t cure my illness and it will be a waste of your money. You all know that I have been cultivating for so many years and my health has been very good. I was not careful and I fell. It may not be a bad thing for people to suffer a little. Don’t worry, I will be fine in a few days.” They left, but they were still worried. I knew the principle that one has to go through suffering in order to pay back one’s karmic debts, and so I just tried to bear the physical pain. By studying the [Fa], I found a lot of bad attachments and human notions, and tried to let go of them one after the other. I thought, “I am a cultivator. I have to be able to endure pain and hardship. I cannot stay in bed.” On the third day, I got out of bed to do the Dafa exercises. But my legs couldn’t hold my weight, so I leaned on the bed and did the exercises. I then held on to a bench to walk little by little. Within a few days, I was able to cook and eat by myself. My children again came to see me on Sunday, and one of my in-laws also came. As soon as they entered the room and saw me standing, they were amazed. They said, “Are you okay? We were all scared because you didn’t go for any medical treatment. How did you recover so quickly? Falun Dafa is truly miraculous!” The Young Man Did Not Want Me to Hang Up Over the past few years, I began to buy phone cards and call people to [clarify the truth] about Falun Dafa. One day, the call was picked up by a young man. After I said a few words, he said, “I have finally found you. You don’t need to say any more. I have listened to four such calls already and I understand everything. I am a CCP member. Please help me withdraw from the CCP.” I gave him a pseudonym, and he was very happy. I continued to tell him how to help his family members withdraw from the CCP and its youth organizations. He said, “Don’t hang up yet. I will get our manager and you can ask him to withdraw, too.” I heard him running to knock on a door and then he said, “Manager, come and hear this phone call! She will help you withdraw from the CCP and stay safe during catastrophes!” But his manager didn’t want to and told him to leave him alone. He came back to the phone and said to me, “Don’t hang up just yet. There is someone else.” Then he said to someone, “Ling, come out quickly and listen to the phone. Someone will help you stay safe and avoid catastrophes.” A girl came to the phone and I said to her, “You are so fortunate to have such a great co-worker. He wants you to be safe, too. What I’d like to tell you today is that many Chinese people are withdrawing from the CCP now, in order to stay away from catastrophes and be safe. This is because when you joined it, you made an oath to dedicate your life to the Party and fight for it for the rest of your life. After making such an oath, it means that your life belongs to the Party. Even if you forget about this oath, heaven will not forget it. When heaven destroys the CCP, the people who made the oath will suffer. If you now withdraw from the CCP, it will abolish this poisonous oath, and you will be free of this evil organization and receive blessings from the heavens. This is why we all have to withdraw from the CCP. Does that make sense?” “Yes,” she said, “I will withdraw from it. Thank you!” The young man also thanked me. I said, “There is no need to thank me. As Falun Dafa practitioners, it’s our wish that all sentient beings be saved. You should thank our Master, who is saving you.” They both said together, “Thank you, Falun Dafa’s Master!” Prisoners Recite the “Nine-Character Mantra” I was arrested and taken to a detention center for practicing Dafa in 2011. When I was first taken to the cell, someone told me in a low voice, “This cell’s lead is very fierce. She swears at and beats up people at will, and she forces Falun Gong practitioners to do all the dirty and tiring work. If they don’t finish the work on time, she will punish them. You have to be careful.” The cell lead was in her 30s and was being detained for selling drugs. She could come in and leave the cell as she pleased and ate whatever she wanted. But she looked very sad all day, because she had heard that she would be sentenced to 12 years. A few days later, she suddenly developed a high fever. She got some medical treatment but was not getting better. She couldn’t sleep much for two days and nights. I went to talk to her. “I have a method,” I said, “but it’s up to you to believe it or not. All you need to do is to silently recite the nine-character mantra, ‘Falun Dafa is good; Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.’” She said she believed it. I then said, “You should also withdraw from the CCP organizations.” She said, “I joined the Young Pioneers and the Communist Youth League when I was young. My last name is Zhang. Help me withdraw from them.” I looked her in the eyes and said, “People who treat Dafa practitioners with kindness will be blessed; those who persecute Dafa practitioners will bring retribution to themselves.” She nodded. I said, “You can start reciting the nine-character mantra silently now.” She got up very early the next morning. She came to me and whispered, “Ma’am, I have recovered! It’s miraculous!” Then she left with a smile on her face. When she came back again, she brought two delicious dishes. Each had millet porridge, two eggs, a fried dough stick, and two stir-fried vegetables. She kept one dish and gave me one. In comparison, the food provided in the detention center was just steamed buns and frozen cabbage soup, with mud underneath the cabbage. From then on, she boiled a large pot of water every day and put it in front of me. She said to everyone, “This is boiled water for Falun Gong practitioners. No one else is allowed to drink it.” A week later, a guard came in holding a piece of paper and told her to get packed and go home, and that she was sentenced to three years of supervised release. She couldn’t believe it. She grabbed the paper and read it several times. She started crying with joy and jumped around in circles while hugging a friend of hers in the cell. She cried and said, “The day I heard that I was going to get sentenced to 12 years, I really didn’t want to live anymore. Today is such a blessing from heaven!” I told her, “My girl, do you realize what happened? It’s because you understood the truth and treated Dafa practitioners well. Therefore, you received blessings today.” She said, “Yes, yes!” She put her palms together and thanked me. I said, “No need to thank me. You should thank Dafa’s Master!” She hurriedly said, “Thank you, Falun Gong Master! Thank you, Falun Gong Master!” She went home happily. In the two days after she left, 19 out of 21 people in our cell withdrew from the CCP and its affiliated youth organizations. My Family Members Recite the “Nine-Character Mantra” to Survive the Pandemic When the pandemic was at its worst in China at the end of 2022, around 10 p.m. one night, my eldest son called me and said, “Mom, I’m feeling really terrible.” I said, “Have you forgotten that at critical times, you need to recite the nine-character mantra?” He said, “I did forget. I’ll start reciting it now.” Early the next morning, he called again, “I have recovered now, but my wife and child are sick.” I said, “Tell them the same method I told you, and everything will be fine.” One day later, both of them had recovered. I was worried about my sister’s family and I called them. My sister said she got the virus and was standing in the room, because she could not sit down; and that she had been out of breath all night last night. I quickly told her, “Reciting the nine-character mantra can save your life!” The next day, my sister called and said, “I’ve been reciting it for a whole night. Now I’m good and can lie down to sleep!” Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "L’Europa occidentale crede comprensibilmente che siano in corso due guerre: una in Ucraina e una a Gaza. E tuttavia non è così. Per vederlo basta esaminare più da vicino le caratteristiche di una guerra. Una guerra non è uno scontro di tifosi o un incidente di frontiera; almeno tra i Paesi civili, è uno scontro tra Stati. In questo tipo di guerra si affrontano due eserciti. - Leggi anche: [Israele, le guerre si combattono per vincere](https://www.italiaoggi.it/news/la-logica-e-militare-e-una-vincere-202408061253553879) Per non coinvolgere i civili, tutti i combattenti sono in divisa. Ciò è necessario per distinguere commilitoni, nemici e, appunto, civili: ovviamente in borghese e senza armi. Secondo le Convenzioni di Ginevra chi porta armi senza divisa può essere immediatamente ucciso. Tra i belligeranti ogni colpo è permesso, salvo quelli che costituiscono crimine, come il massacro di donne e bambini o il bombardamento di ospedali, cosa in cui i russi sono degli specialisti. E si potrebbe continuare. La guerra a Gaza che caratteristiche ha? Ora ci si può chiedere: quante di queste caratteristiche si riscontrano a Gaza? Se non ricordo male, i tre elementi essenziali di uno Stato sono: popolo, controllo del territorio e governo. Bisogna innanzi tutto distinguere Nazione da Stato. La Nazione è costituita, ad esempio, dagli italiani che si sentono italiani, che amano l’Italia e che sarebbero disposti a combattere per essa. Viceversa lo Stato è un ente giuridico che impone la propria volontà a tutta la popolazione che ami o che odi l’Italia. La Nazione è un dato culturale e affettivo. Per identificare il popolo, escludendo il concetto di Nazione, si possono accorpare i concetti di territorio e popolazione. Il territorio è delimitato dalle frontiere; la popolazione è costituita dalle persone che abitano e vivono stabilmente in quel territorio. Hamas non ha più il controllo del territorio, passato a Israele Hamas non ha più il controllo del territorio, passato a Israele. Dunque, se Israele trattasse con Hamas, le regalerebbe uno status internazionale che non merita. La guerra normale è tra eserciti e a Gaza invece i terroristi si vestono da civili. La conseguenza è che, legittimamente, per quanto riguarda Israele, la guerra non può non coinvolgere la popolazione. Hamas non amministra nulla, non ha né il controllo del territorio né delle persone: insomma non è un governo. E per giunta non è neanche reperibile sul suolo della Striscia. La Striscia di Gaza con Hamas oggi non è uno Stato. Nessun armistizio può essere negoziato con Hamas. I negoziati di cui tanto si parla sono un contentino per le anime belle e per coloro che credono di averne una. Sarebbe come se il Presidente degli Stati Uniti, trattasse un accordo con un Al Capone residente in Qatar. Gerusalemme vuole una vendetta esemplare per l’attacco del 7 ottobre Hamas il 7 ottobre ha commesso un orrendo crimine di guerra, la cui conseguenza, a parti invertite, avrebbe comportato la morte di tutti gli ebrei. È comprensibile che Gerusalemme voglia una vendetta esemplare. Quella di Gaza non è dunque una guerra tra Stati ma una gigantesca vendetta e una gigantesca eliminazione di tutti coloro che sono stati responsabili delle azioni delittuose del 7 ottobre. Normalmente uno Stato non ha poteri di polizia all’estero. Ma Gaza non è all’estero, fa parte dei Territori Occupati. E in secondo luogo Israele ha la forza militare di fare ciò che vuole.

    "text": "Cinéma : les genres horreur et fantastique peinent à se diffuser, l'industrie leur préférant les comédies et le cinéma social\nLe\nFestival de Gérardmer, qui se déroule cette année du 29 janvier au 2 février, est un festival international qui se consacre au cinéma fantastique et d'horreur depuis les années 90. Auparavant, c'était le célèbre Festival d'Avoriaz qui tenait ce rôle avec brio, depuis 1973. Le genre regorgeait alors de réussites et, à l'époque, on a pu y découvrir coup sur coup Duel de Steven Spielberg (Grand prix 1973), Soleil vert de Richard Fleisher (lauréat 1974) et Phantom Of The Paradise de Brian de Palma (lauréat 1975).\nEn 1994,\nla station Avoriaz passe le flambeau à la ville de Gérardmer, où ont été mis à l'honneur des pépites comme Créatures célestes de Peter Jackson (Grand prix 1995), Cube de Vincenzo Natali (lauréat 1999), Dark Water de Hideo Nakata (lauréat 2003), ou encore It Follows de David Robert Mitchell (lauréat 2015).\nMais le plus vieux festival du genre a été créé en 1968, en Espagne, dans un petit village côtier catalan. Et aujourd'hui encore, le Festival de Sitges existe et est le paradis des films fantastiques, d'horreur et de science-fiction. Ce premier festival international du genre est en effet devenu, au fil des années, le plus important festival de cinéma fantastique au monde.\n\"Une passion célébrée en communauté\"\nCe succès et sa renommée mondiale s'expliquent parce que c'est un festival \"qui prend en compte les fans\", explique son directeur Ángel Sala. \"Il s’agit d’un festival qui fait la part belle au public, où la passion pour le cinéma fantastique est célébrée en communauté. Résultat : on rassemble de plus en plus de gens et chaque année, les ventes de billets augmentent.\" Le directeur rappelle aussi que la renommée internationale s'est aussi faite en créant des phénomènes, avec \"des films qui sont devenus des incontournables du genre au cours de ces dernières décennies\". C'est à Sitges, par exemple, que David Lynch présente Blue Velvet à sa sortie en 1986, et décroche le Prix du meilleur film dans la section officielle.\nLors de la dernière édition, en octobre 2024, 234 longs-métrages et 112 courts-métrages ont été projetés. Mais le film qui a remporté le premier prix du Festival, Le Bain du diable des Autrichiens Veronika Franz et Severin Fiala, n'a rassemblé en 2024 que près de 120 000 spectateurs en Espagne. Cela montre que l'industrie du cinéma fantastique ne se porte pas bien. Pourtant en Espagne, le genre longtemps méprisé a connu ses heures de gloire dans les années 1990 et 2000, avec des réalisateurs aussi prestigieux que Álex de la Iglesia ou Amenábar, et des films aux titres évocateurs comme Le Jour de la bête, Les Autres ou encore L'Orphelinat.\nL'industrie cinématographique et la peur du box-office\nActuellement, le cinéma dit \"de genre\" a beaucoup plus de mal à se développer, si l'on en croit Ángel Sala, le directeur du Festival de Sitges. \"Aujourd’hui, les films comiques sont privilégiés, tout comme le cinéma social, plus populaire actuellement que le fantastique, décrit-il. Le fantastique n’est pas considéré par l’industrie comme un genre de production fondamental, comme il pouvait l'être dans les années 2000. Je vois l’avenir avec une certaine inquiétude. L’industrie ne soutient pas les jeunes talents qui veulent faire du cinéma fantastique parce qu'elle a peur du box-office. Et même lorsqu'il y a de bons films espagnols de genre qui sortent, il est difficile de les voir en salle. Pourtant, ce sont des films qui ont bien marché dans un festival comme Sitges, mais ils ont ensuite du mal à trouver un moyen de sortir en salles et d'être rentables.\"\nSi le cinéma fantastique espagnol doit faire face actuellement à de nombreuses difficultés, des pousses vertes sont perçues dans le cinéma d'animation, comme en témoigne le film Mariposas negras (Les Papillons noirs) de David Baute, sur le changement climatique. Présenté en octobre à Sitges, il a reçu plusieurs prix ces derniers mois.",
