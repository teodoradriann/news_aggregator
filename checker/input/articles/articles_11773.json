    "text": "It feels like we are just getting settled in with Windows 11, which just crested its two-year anniversary in October of last year. However, Windows 12 is expected to land sometime in 2024, shaking up the release cycle for Microsoft and bringing a slew of new features and a reworked design. Though we can't disclose anything official about it yet, one designer made a mockup called Windows XP 2024 Edition, which is everything Windows 12 should be.\nWindows XP came to market in 2001, garnering mass support and appeal. XP was so pervasive, it had more active users than Windows 8.X in 2015. Microsoft finally took the OS out back in 2019, ending a 17-year lifespan leading up to Windows 10 and now Windows 11. However, there is still some nostalgia for the now-relic of Windows past. As such, designer AR 4789 decided to come up with an updated version of Windows XP if it were to come out in 2024, which you can see below.\nIt is safe to say that while the design is not all that dissimilar from Windows 11 , it just brings back the look and feel of Windows XP. Moreover, it simplifies everything, which is a core problem some people face with newer operating systems. That and the fact that the Start Menu is not internet-connected are big wins in our book. Even the settings menu is improved with a look and feel like a crossover between the two operating systems.\nAt the end of the day, it would be sweet to be able to play with this and see how it feels in the real world, but sadly, it is just a UI concept. However, maybe Microsoft will take some design ideas from this and make it a reality with Windows 12, which would be cool. We will have to wait and see, but in the meantime, let us know what you think of this concept in the comments below.\nComments Tags: Microsoft , Windows XP , (nasdaq:msft) , windows 12 ",

    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "title": "Outdoor skating on Vancouver Island comes with a warning | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Cold snap brings rare opportunity for outdoor skating on Vancouver Island During this unusual cold snap on Vancouver Island, people were not going to let an opportunity slip through their hands. “It’s so special,” said Derek Wong, a Saanich resident. Dozens hit Panama Flats in Saanich, no matter the consequences. “I’m skipping a bit of school for it,” said Ayami Nishi, who was playing hooky for the day. It was the chance to lace up your skates and hit the outdoor rink. It’s something that people living in the rest of the country may take for granted. “It’s actually amazing to see everybody out here with their kids and families,” said Linda Lee. Linda Lee hit the ice with her friend Derek Wong at 9 a.m. sharp. “The ice hasn’t been this solid in probably over a decade,” said Wong. You would think all the kids on the ice were skipping school on Monday, but not the ones from Lochside Elementary School. “Four hundred-plus kids are off school today because a water main burst,” said Matt King, who was at the flats with his three children. It wasn’t just the Panama Flats seeing all the action during this unusual cold snap. On Sunday, the Polo Field in Brentwood Bay became the most popular place in town. “It’s a great view, good ice, you can’t ask for much more,” said a Nanaimo resident. On Monday, people took to Witchcraft Lake at the base of Mount Benson Trail to act out their outdoor hockey dreams, but not all bodies of water are safe for skating on. “The larger the body of water, the more unlikely it is that it’s frozen all the way through,” said Chief Chris Aubrey of Langford Fire Rescue. People visiting Thetis Lake in View Royal saw thin ice warning signs along the shore. That ice is not thick enough to support someone, meaning they would certainly break through, falling into the freezing water below. Thin ice warning signs at Thetis Lake in View Royal“It only takes a moment to incapacitate you if you happen to end up getting into trouble,” said Aubrey. That warning is meant for your pets as well. “Keep your dogs on a leash when they’re near the water because they are not going to know, and they could easily fall through the ice as well,” said the Fire Chief. Beginning Wednesday, the weather is expected to start to warm, making the ice on Thetis Lake all the more unstable. For now, people like Linda and Derek are taking advantage of a rare opportunity, knowing that this potentially could be their last outdoor skate of the season. “We might be able to skate on it tomorrow morning for a bit, but I’m guessing this will be the last of it,” said Wong. Unless of course, winter weather makes another rare appearance before spring arrives.
