    "title": "AI Takes Center Stage In Twilio’s 2024 State Of Customer Engagement Report",
    "text": "I always enjoy analyzing year-on-year trends or a good state of tech report, so I’ve been looking forward to the Twilio 2024 State of Customer Engagement Report . After we saw such a huge explosion of generative AI in 2023, it is no surprise that AI took center stage in this year’s analysis, which surveyed 4,750 business leaders and 6,300 consumers to get a pulse check on how well brands are doing in customer engagement and satisfaction.\nThe 2024 State of Customer Engagement Report includes samples from four age groups, from Gen Z (ages 18-27) to Baby Boomers (ages 60-75) across 18 countries. The response was clear: everyone—young and old, near and far—want better, more cohesive digital experiences. In fact, while 81% of brands say they understand their customers deeply, less than half – 46% – of consumers agree. Perhaps 2024 will be the year that brands figure out how to close the gap in using AI and generative AI to meet increasing consumer demands.\nThroughout the extensive report, the in-depth research and analysis focused on five key insights surrounding customer engagement. Here is a breakdown of the focus areas and my analysis of what the data means for enterprises focused on using technology to deliver next generation customer experiences.\nAI Can Improve Customer Engagement Although this trend seems obvious, Twilio has the receipts to show that leaning into AI can provide solid benefits for both brand and consumer. Case in point: while just 17% of the 4,750 businesses Twilio surveyed were deemed to be Engagement Leaders (leading the pack in terms of things like personalized customer experience, omnichannel engagement, and first-party data use), those companies were also seeing clear, real-world benefits over their lower performing competitors. According to the report. Engagement leaders saw an average revenue increase of 123% this past year specifically due to investments in customer engagement. Brands that didn’t invest as much, or who were considered “low-maturity,” saw increases of just 30%.\nOn average, 7 in 10 companies surveyed say they are already using AI to personalize content and marketing. They also say they are already experiencing solid impacts, including:\n● Higher customer satisfaction scores (45%)\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor ● Better data-driven decision-making (41%)\n● Improved market segmentation and targeting (41%)\nReinforcing an existing trend, 55% of consumers say they are willing to spend more money for a customized experience. Point being: Investing in AI-driven customer engagement strategies can absolutely help brands connect more with customers while growing their businesses.\nFor reference, the top five ways businesses are incorporating AI into their engagement strategies on average: customer analytics (59%), CRM systems (58%), communications platforms as a service/CPaaS (54%), customer surveys (54%), and marketing automation platforms (53%).\nConsumer Data and Trust Are Interlinked Consumers were clear in this year’s report. Six in 10 said protecting their data was the top way to build trust. Even among age groups, there wasn’t a stark difference on that point. Gen Z at 56% and Baby Boomers at 67% all had a majority+ showing on this point. At the same time, another perception gap surfaced: While businesses say privacy and security are big concerns for 2024, just 64% are currently using AI to manage fraud or reduce risk. That means there is a lot of room for AI to step up and help assuage some of the security issues that are inherent to a world with data at its center.\nJust as people want to know their data is safe, they also want to know how brands are using their personal information. Nearly half said they would trust brands more if they were more forthcoming with how data is being used in AI-powered interactions. I’m surprised that the number isn’t higher. Isn’t everyone curious about how algorithms use data to present product and service offerings? And on the issue of transparency, we see another gap: more than 90% of brands say they are transparent with customers about how AI uses their data, but less than half of consumers agree with that statement.\nIn essence, what we’re seeing is that brands are carrying a greater burden to use personal information to make customers feel seen and heard while customers don’t always understand why or how their information is being used to create the interactions that brands are creating. In fact, the study showed that 40% of brands said finding that balance between security and customer experience is one of the most pressing challenges in 2024. Again, I’m surprised that number isn’t far higher.\nThird-Party Cookies Are Still a Thing Apple started making it difficult to collect cookies a few years ago, and Google is phasing out cookies by Q3 this year. Still, Twilio’s report showed that more than 50% of brands still rely on third-party data. Thus, this year we should be seeing a rush toward first-party data collection so that companies can continue to refine their personalization projects.\nThe switch toward first-party data collection is in motion. Last year, those who had moved to mostly/primarily first-party data for marketing was just 19%. This year, that number was 48%. There is a lot of work to be done. Just 2 in 3 brands indicated they were “fully prepared” for a cookie-less future. And being prepared means not just being able to access the data first-hand but also to analyze it in a meaningful way. Which, again, is where AI comes in, and where many brands are falling short. One of the most shocking insights: Only 16% of brands said they “strongly agree” that they have the tools they need to understand their customers. They have their work cut out for them in 2024.\nYounger Consumers Are More Demanding When It Comes to Digital Experience According to Twilio, Gen Z and Millennial consumers want nearly 70% of their brand interactions to be digital. The fact that nearly 60% of Baby Boomers also feel this way is a sign that the shift to a preferred digital experience is fairly universal. There has been competing evidence on this point ( some sources say Gen Z is swinging back toward a brick-and-mortar shopping experience), but Twilio’s research seems to support what most of us already know: A personalized customer experience is key to brand success across age groups. Almost 70% of Gen Z and Millennials said they would stop using a specific brand without a personalized experience.\nThe Gap Is Where True Growth Lies The best way for brands to secure a win today is to lessen the gap between how they think they are doing and how their customers feel they are doing when it comes to customer engagement. More than 80% of brands said they were “good” or “excellent” at providing positive customer engagement. At the same time, just 54% of consumers agreed with that point. In fact, more than 30% of consumers said they had purchased from a different brand when a company failed to personalize their experience in real time.\nDo customers have unrealistic expectations of what brands are able to offer right now in terms of personalized experience via AI and generative AI? Or are brands failing to collect/analyze the data that customers are providing in order to create the experiences consumers want? The truth is probably a bit of both.\nWe’ve seen such a fervor over AI and generative AI this past year, that it’s likely consumers have a skewed idea of what’s possible with AI, especially for small and midsize companies that might lack the resources to invest in AI for a fully seamless customer experience. That means many customers might still be dealing with issues like disjointed omnichannel experiences or “bad AI” moments such as seeing an ad for a product they left a scathing review about. These experiences make brands seem out of touch and tone deaf because customers know better experiences are possible.\nAt the same time, especially as third-party cookies are phased out and more brands make a quick move to first-party cookies, it’s likely that consumer experience will feel a bit fractured in the coming year. Brands will need to do a better job of projecting transparency to their customers—letting them know the limits of what is possible now and what they hope to provide in the future. All the data in the world can’t produce a good customer experience if a company doesn’t have the right tech in place to analyze and act on their insights. And all the AI in the world is pointless if a company doesn’t have the parts of the foundation in place to collect the data they really need to understand their customers.\nTwilio’s 2024 State of Customer Engagement Report aligns well with both our intelligence and market perspective that AI is going to be front and center in bringing those worlds together—and given the current impact that AI is having on every industry, role, and geography, business leaders should expect this to continue to be the case for many years to come.\nDaniel Newman Following",

    "title": "China Reacts to Trump Review of Nuclear Submarine Deal - Newsweek",
    "text": "China restated its opposition to the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement after the Trump administration initiated a review of the trilateral defense pact.\nThe Pentagon review will determine whether the alliance between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia aligns with Trump's \"America First\" policy priorities.\nThe AUKUS defense pact , established in 2021, centers on providing Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines, costing $240 billion, and sharing cutting-edge military technologies among the three allied nations.\nIt is intended to lead to an expansion of patrols of the Indo-Pacific region by Western allies, and forms part of the strategic plan to counter China.\nBeijing delivered its response during a scheduled press conference, warning against increased regional military competition and nuclear proliferation.\nWhy It Matters The AUKUS review marks a critical moment for international security partnerships and power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, a region central to American strategic interests.\nThe U.S. has made clear it sees the great power competition with China as its geopolitical priority. But the review fits with a pattern of uncertainty about the strength of U.S. commitment to its alliances, echoed in the debate about its future role in NATO .\nWhat To Know The Pentagon confirmed a formal review of the AUKUS security partnership to assess whether it serves U.S. interests under Trump's \"America First\" agenda.\nA spokesperson for the Pentagon told several publications that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"made clear\" this \"means ensuring the highest readiness of our service members, that allies step up fully to do their part for collective defense, and that the defense industrial base is meeting our needs.\"\n\"Any changes to the administration's approach for AUKUS will be communicated through official channels, when appropriate,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe review is headed by Elbridge Colby, under secretary of Defense for Policy, who has previously questioned sharing advanced submarine technology amid global tensions, the British newspaper Financial Times reported.\nThe Biden-era agreement involved the U.S. selling up to five Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines to Australia from 2032, followed by a jointly developed submarine with the U.K. and Australia in the 2040s.\nFile photo: U.S. Navy personnel stand atop USS 'New Hampshire' at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 29, 2025. File photo: U.S. Navy personnel stand atop USS 'New Hampshire' at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 29, 2025. CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images China articulated its repeated objections to the AUKUS partnership, arguing the agreement threatens stability in the Indo-Pacific and would worsen the arms race.\nAUKUS has faced criticism from Beijing since its inception, with official statements warning of increased nuclear proliferation and regional instability as a result of the collaboration among Western military powers.\nAustralian officials reacted calmly to the news, describing the review as a normal process for a new U.S. administration. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said the long-term pact was central to his country's security and would still go ahead.\nAn official spokesperson for the U.K. Ministry of Defence called the arrangement \"one of the most strategically important partnerships in decades,\" reaffirming London's support for the submarine project and related defense technology sharing. The spokesperson said it was \"understandable\" for new administrations to conduct such reviews.\nThe AUKUS pact positions Australia to become only the seventh country to possess and operate nuclear submarines, boosting regional patrol capabilities. From 2027, U.S. and U.K. nuclear-powered submarines will be rotated through Perth, Australia, as part of the current AUKUS agreement.\nWhat People Are Saying Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a Thursday briefing : \"China has made clear more than once its position on the so-called trilateral security partnership between the U.S., U.K., and Australia, designed to advance cooperation on nuclear submarines and other cutting-edge military technologies … We oppose manufacturing bloc confrontations and anything that amplifies the risk of nuclear proliferation and exacerbates the arms race.\"\nRichard Marles, Australian defense minister, said to ABC Radio Melbourne on June 12 : \"I'm very confident this is going to happen … This is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think, whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken.\"\nA U.K. Ministry of Defence spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News : \"AUKUS is a landmark security and defence partnership with two of our closest allies. It is one of the most strategically important partnerships in decades, supporting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic, while also delivering jobs and economic growth in communities across all three nations.\"\nWhat Happens Next The Pentagon review, led by Elbridge Colby, is ongoing and expected to conclude ahead of the anticipated release of the Trump Administration's revised National Defense Strategy in August 2025.\nAustralian, U.K., and U.S. officials are scheduled to continue talks on defense coordination and financial commitments, with additional updates expected at the forthcoming G7 summit in Canada.",

    "text": "Kicking off the year with a beautiful lights display, stargazers will be in for a treat as the first meteor shower of 2024 is set to arrive this week. The Quadrantids, as the shower is known, have been active since December 26, 2023, and will continue to be visible in the night sky well up till January 16 but will peak Thursday, January 4, making this the best time to see the first shower of the year. The Quadrantids have the potential to be the strongest shower of the year, and it has only just begun, although the showers usually fall short due to the short length of the maximum activity, sitting around only 6 hours, and poor weather conditions. These meteors under the night sky average 25 meteors an hour and usually lack a consistent trail but instead produce large, bright fireballs. During their peak, however, NASA says the Quadrantids could be capable of up to 120 meteors an hour, though with the moon set to be at half-illumination, observers' view may be interfered with somewhat, but this can be minimized. It is still unclear if this year's weather will remain clear enough for a strong shower even during peak time or if it will fall short once again. When exactly is peak time? According to [EarthSky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide/) the shower will peak at 7:53 a.m. ET on January 4, 2024. But to get the best view, you might want to head outside around 4:50 a.m. and watch till the sun is up. However, due to the northerly declination of the shower (celestial latitude), it will not be well seen from the southern hemisphere, meaning those in Australia may not get to see the light show.",

    "title": "Superman & Lois Had Plans For A Major Justice League Villain Before Its Cancellation",
    "text": "Superman & Lois Had Plans For A Major Justice League Villain Before Its Cancellation\nThe Arrowverse is a vital part of TV history, one that helped bring the expansiveness, the interconnectedness, the weird, and the soapy parts of DC's comic book superhero stories to the small screen. It also featured DC superheroes that had never been adapted in live-action before (like Black Lightning and Batwoman), all the while giving the spotlight to lesser-known comic book villains such as Merlyn, Savitar, and the Eradicator.\nStill, when the franchise featured big, iconic villains from the pages of DC Comics, it resulted in some truly thrilling superhero stories — like Reverse-Flash going from battling Flash to founding the Legion of Doom, or how \"Superman & Lois\" brought in and then reinvented Doomsday. Much like \"The Flash\" had time to introduce lesser-known rogues while also including some of the titular character's most famous opponents, \"Superman & Lois\" managed to pack in most of the Man of Steel's greatest enemies in just four seasons — just not exactly the way you'd expect. There was General Zod, except here he was merely a computerized consciousness stored in the Eradicator before he briefly took over Superman's body. There was also Bizarro Superman, who later became Doomsday. And then in season 4, Lex Luthor was reimagined as a man who's more brawn than brains, yet just as terrifying as ever.\nAs perfect as \"Superman & Lois\" was — and it is arguably the best Superman story since the 1978 \"Superman\" — it's hard not to wonder what the series could've done had it been allowed to realize its original seven-season plan, especially when it comes to the show's villains. (We never got to see the series' take on Mister Mxyzptlk, for example.) At the same time, we did get glimpses of the villains that could've factored into future seasons, had they come to pass. In season 4, for instance, \"Superman & Lois\" introduced Milton Fine (a character who was famously possessed by the supervillain Brainiac in the comics).\nSpeaking with TV Line, showrunner Todd Helbing confirmed Milton was originally intended to be a bigger part of the show's story. \"If we went on for a couple more seasons, we would have really explored Brainiac,\" he explained. \"We would have done more cool, traditional Brainiac stuff with him.\"\nEven more exciting, Helbing revealed that the \"Superman & Lois\" writers had set their sights on eventually bringing in the greatest villain of the DC Comics universe to serve as the show's ultimate big bad: Darkseid.\nSuperman & Lois could have included Darkseid\nDarkseid is the ultimate evil of the DC Comics universe, a formidable villain who is as strong as — if not stronger than — Superman (although he could've easily become a Marvel Comics villain instead). He makes perfect sense as a sort of final boss for \"Superman & Lois,\" especially when season 4 had already given us an adaptation of the \"Death of Superman\" comic book arc.\n\"There's also a way to lead up to Darkseid that we had talked about,\" Helbing added. \"I don't know if DC would have given us permission to use Darkseid, but we would have pitched the hell out of it to try to get it. That would have been a lot of fun.\"\nFirst of all, Brainiac would have been a great idea. Milton had already proven himself a formidable opponent in season 4; he was a crafty villain who could outmaneuver Superman's allies, and whose strategy could've allowed him to match Superman's strength. The Brainiac character has proven himself well-suited for live-action, too, with appearances everywhere from \"Smallville\" to \"Krypton.\"\nDarkseid, however, is definitely an ambitious choice. After all, the character has never really been properly adapted in live-action before, save for his brief appearance in \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" (which was originally released direct-to-streaming). Even when \"Smallville\" brought in a version of the character, he was basically a cloud of smoke. It would have been fascinating to see \"Superman & Lois\" give Darkseid a try, especially given he'd definitely require a bigger team to defeat him than just Superman alone.\nNow that \"Superman & Lois\" has come to an end, we're left with \"My Adventures With Superman\" as the sole Man of Steel project on TV at the moment. Given that James Gunn is taking the character back into the big screen next year as part of his DC Universe relaunch, it's unlikely he'll be returning to television in live-action anytime soon, either.\n\"Superman & Lois\" is streaming in its entirety on the CW app.",

    "text": "Ha pasado un año desde el accidente en el que el actor Jeremy Renner casi pierde la vida, y ese lapso le sirvió no solo para recuperarse de las heridas físicas, sino también a replantearse lo que ha hecho con su vida. El año pasado no fue fácil para el histrión californiano, quien estuvo trabajando duro en su rehabilitación para recobrar la movilidad y, de hecho, se dejó ver en algunas alfombras rojas acompañado de un bastón, pero todo parece indicar que esto ha quedado atrás y anunció a través de sus redes sociales, como regalo de cumpleaños, que regresará a los sets para filmar la serie \"The Mayor of Kingstown\".\nLee también: ¿Cómo se encuentra Jeremy Renner? A un año del accidente con la máquina quitanieves\nLa noticia no solo ha alegrado a los seguidores de \"Hawkeye\", uno de los personajes del Universo Marvel, sino también al gremio porque se pensaba que el actor podría no regresar a los escenarios dado lo aparatoso del accidente que sufrió y que lo mantuvo al borde de la muerte.\nCon 53 años , que cumple este 7 de enero, el actor retomará su carrera tras la pausa obligatoria y afirma sentirse preparado para el siguiente reto en la tercera temporada de la serie de Paramount +.\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nmelc",

    "text": "É melhor começar já a procurar locais sem poluição luminosa — ou como quem diz, longe dos centros urbanos — para assistir ao fenómeno que vai iluminar os céus do País em outubro. Esta é a época do ano favorita dos amantes de astronomia, já que traz quase sempre uma série de momentos incríveis. Um deles vai ser a incrível chuva de meteoros das Dracónidas, visíveis apenas no Hemisfério Norte, segundo a “Meteored”.\nA atividade das Dracónidas pode gerar cerca de 20 meteoros por hora com uma velocidade de 20 quilómetros por segundo. De acordo com o Royal Museums Greenwich, o fenómeno estará ativo entre domingo, 6, e quinta-feira, 10 de outubro. O pico, contudo, deverá ser atingido entre os dias 8 e 9 de outubro, terça e quarta-feira.\nOs meteoros nas chuvas anuais têm o nome do ponto no céu de onde parecem irradiar. O nome Dracónidas resulta dos traços das suas estrelas cadentes parecerem sair dum ponto da constelação do Dragão, sendo que o radiante da chuva das Dracónidas se encontra na constelação do Dragão.\nEsta chuva de estrelas, também chamada Giacobínidas, está associada ao cometa Giacobini-Zinner. Geralmente, a iluminação no céu é causada quando a Terra passa por uma nuvem de detritos deste mesmo corpo celeste.\nPara conseguir assistir ao fenómeno, deve procurar locais a boa altitude com o horizonte desimpedido, adaptar a visão à escuridão e olhar na direção oposta à lua. Outra opção é ficar hospedado num alojamento afastado da poluição luminosa, como o Lugar nas Estrelas.\nCarregue na galeria para conhecer o primeiro alojamento em Portugal a figurar na rede da Fundação Starlight, que destaca os lugares com pouca poluição luminosa, onde os visitantes têm oportunidades únicas e inigualáveis para o céu noturno.",
