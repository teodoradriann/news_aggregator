    "title": "Pelicans Host Jazz Looking to Avoid Fourth Straight Loss at Home - The Bird Writes",
    "text": "NEW ORLEANS – The New Orleans Pelicans have not given their fans much reason for holiday cheer, having lost three of their last four games, with all of those defeats happening inside the walls of the Smoothie King Center. Worse than that, the losses have come in horrible fashion, with the Pelicans squandering fourth quarter leads in each game. In fact, nine of their 14 losses this season have come in games where New Orleans has held a double-digit lead. The Pels are 5-8 in clutch games this season, and 0-9 in games decided by three points or less. During these last four games, they’ve failed to find any semblance of rhythm or fight when the games have mattered most. |Category||Game (Rank)||4Q (Rank)| |ORTG||114.9 (19)||106.5 (26)| |DRTG||110.8 (4)||138.7 (30)| |NET||4.1 (11)||-32.2 (30)| |AST/TO||1.84 (18)||1.36 (27)| |REB%||49.9 (16)||40.0 (30)| |TOV%||12.9 (12)||15.2 (26)| |TS%||57.6 (21)||55.0 (22)| |Pace||96.73 (29)||92.5 (23)| |Possessions||396 (23)||92 (26)| The production of the Pels’ “Big 3” of Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, and CJ McCollum in the fourth quarter has dropped compared to last season. So far, the trio is posting averages of 15.5 points, 3.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.8 turnovers in the final frame, with an average +/- of -1.96 (51.3 FG%, 38.7 3P%, 71.0 FT%). During the 2022-23 campaign they averaged 17.7 pts, 3.5 rebs, 3.7 asts, and 1.8 turnovers, with an average +/- of 1.3 (50.7 FG%, 38.4 3P%, 72.2 FT%). That’s a swing of -3.26 in the wrong direction. Tonight’s opponent, the Utah Jazz, are already 2-0 versus the Pelicans this season. Those wins came by a total of seven points. In the first meeting, New Orleans led by nine heading into the fourth quarter before being dominated in the fourth quarter and outscored by 13 points. In the second, the Jazz made enough plays to hold off the Pelicans late and squeeze out a two-point victory. Utah was left for dead after the departures of Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, but they have continued to be a pest for the Pelicans, winning five in a row against New Orleans since the start of last season. Following the Jazz, the Pelicans face a nine-game stretch of playoff contenders that will take them right up to the halfway point of the season. With the fluid nature of the Western Conference, a poor run through those games could take New Orleans from the middle to the bottom of the pack in the race for the postseason. The New Orleans Pelicans, five years into the Zion Williamson/David Griffin era, are still in search of an identify and waiting for a leader to emerge. Until those things happen, every game will continue to be a coin toss as to knowing which Pelicans team will show up. That’s not what was expected at this stage of the process. The Pelicans should be better. The fans deserve better. Is better still a viable option? That remains to be seen.

    "text": "TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.-En el marco de la celebración de las asambleas del Foro de Sao Paulo, diversos sectores de la oposición política reiteraron su rechazo a la llegada a Honduras de líderes y exmandatarios de la izquierda de América. “Un foro ideológico que trae los países de izquierda y que hoy Honduras se encuentra sumergida en una crisis de seguridad, energía, desempleo, migración y lo que prioriza el gobierno de la refundación son foros que más allá de traer la inversión extranjera nos aleja con la mala imagen el Foro de Sao Paulo a nivel de Latinoamérica”, cuestionó la diputada nacionalista, María Antonieta Mejía. Por su parte, la parlamentaria Claudia Ramírez, del Partido Salvador de Honduras (PSH), indicó que Honduras está a las puertas de una lucha cultural a través del foro de Sao Paulo, el que calificó como un cáncer que avanza como una metástasis que se extiende en América Latina. “En parte sí estamos blindados porque hay una historia que nos avala, hay una verdad que los hondureños, los políticos y oposición abramos los ojos”, exhortó la parlamentaria. De su lado, el general en condición de retiro, Romeo Vásquez Velásquez, señaló que “lo único que puede detener el avance de esta ideología que viene a destruir el país y también atenta contra la iniciativa privada y contra la libertad, es que el pueblo diga basta”. Continúo: “Ellos (Manuel Zelaya y Xiomara Castro) están en un proyecto ambicioso y de ambición para Honduras, porque no es una ambición para Honduras, sino que es personal”. El sábado a las 9:00 de la mañana, el Ejército Ciudadano de Paz convocó a una movilización ante el rechazo de la celebración de sesiones del Foro de Sao Paulo en el país. En rechazo a su llegada, este jueves líderes del Partido Nacional de la corriente interna del precandidato y exedil capitalino Nasry Asfura anunciaron se sumarán a la movilización convocada por el bloque ciudadano en contra del Foro. “Hemos recibido la invitación y confirmamos nuestra presencia en la marcha. Convocamos a toda la coordinación y dirigencia de nuestro movimiento en la capital, a que marchemos por Honduras este próximo sábado 29 de junio, vestidos de blanco”, anunció el aspirante a la alcaldía, Juan Diego Zelaya. El precandidato a la comuna del Distrito Central, reiteró que su postura en contra del Foro es a nivel de movimiento interno y no como institución, por lo que llamo a la clase política a no permanecer tibios ante la situación. En conmemoración a los 15 años del golpe de Estado al derrocado mandatario Manuel Zelaya, el Foro de Sao Paulo realizará varios encuentros en el país a partir de este jueves, concluyendo sus reuniones el sábado 29 de junio.",

    "text": "Canisius Falls Short in Loss to St. Bonaventure\nBy the Numbers\nCanisius men's soccer faced defeat against St. Bonaventure, losing 2-1 despite a strong offensive effort in the second half. The Bonnies opened the scoring early, with goals from Andres Javitt and Luc Finelli. Although Canisius cut the deficit with a goal from Edson Flores, they were unable to capitalize on multiple late scoring opportunities. As a result, Canisius falls to 0-3-0 in non-conference play, while St. Bonaventure secures their first victory of the season.\n- Canisius outshot St. Bonaventure 17-14, including a 10-9 edge on corner kicks.\n- Edson Flores' goal marked his first of the season and first of his collegiate career.\n- St. Bonaventure leads the all-time series against Canisius with a record of 28-18-9.\nDespite Canisius dominating the shot count, their inability to convert scoring chances in the closing minutes illustrates ongoing struggles in finishing plays. Defensive efforts, notably by senior Kodie Sarkodie, bolstered their effort, yet the Griffs remain winless this season.State of Play\n- Canisius remains winless at 0-3-0 after three non-conference matches.\n- St. Bonaventure marked their first win of the season, improving to 1-2-0.\nThe Griffs will host Central Connecticut State for a Labor Day matchup at 1:00 p.m., aiming to turn their fortunes around and secure their first win of the season.Bottom Line\nCanisius must capitalize on scoring opportunities in upcoming matches to shift their current trajectory; a focus on offensive execution will be crucial as they continue their non-conference schedule.\nRead more at\n Canisius University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "On March 25, 2024, the Boca West Country Club will buzz with excitement as more than 400 golf enthusiasts gather for a noble cause at the 12th Annual Boca West Children's Foundation Golf Challenge. This esteemed event aims to raise funds for over 30 children's charities across Palm Beach County, promising a day filled with sportsmanship and philanthropy.\nCommunity and Charity Unite\nThe Golf Challenge has become a staple event in Palm Beach County, drawing participants and spectators alike to support the local community. Pamela Weinroth, the executive director of the Boca West Children's Foundation, highlights the importance of the event, \"The Golf Challenge is an annual fundraiser, and so many people from the community participate in our shared effort to support local kids.\" Non-golfers are also encouraged to join the fun by attending the cocktail reception and dinner, ensuring that everyone has a chance to contribute.\nExciting Events and Generous Donations\nThe day kicks off with registration and brunch at 11 a.m., followed by a unique duck drop event at 12:30 p.m., where participants have a shot at winning $2,500. The golf challenge itself starts at 1 p.m., with a cocktail reception, dinner, and live auction rounding off the evening. The competition is fierce as charities vie for a portion of the $100,000 awarded during the tournament, with each charity guaranteed to receive between $3,000 and $15,000 depending on their team's performance.\nImpact Beyond the Green\nSince its inception, the Boca West Children's Foundation has granted over $18 million to projects serving at-risk youth. This year's Golf Challenge is yet another opportunity to add to that impressive total, providing essential support to those in need within the Palm Beach County community. It's a testament to the power of collective effort and the difference it can make in the lives of local children.\nThe Boca West Children's Foundation's 12th Annual Golf Challenge is more than just a day of golf; it's a celebration of community spirit and the profound impact of philanthropy. As participants and spectators come together, they are reminded of the significant difference they can make, one swing at a time.",

    "text": "O presidente da Assembleia Nacional da Venezuela, Jorge Rodríguez , comparou as eleições do país com as do Brasil e ironizou Celso Amorim, assessor especial da Presidência da República. Segundo o chavista, o TSJ (Tribunal Supremo de Justiça) validou o resultado do pleito de 28 de julho assim como o TSE (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) fez em 2022.\n“É importante dizer que a sentença do TSJ não é apenas na Venezuela onde está a jurisdição superior da sala eleitoral, mas também no Brasil –ouviu, senhor Celso Amorim?–, no México, nos Estados Unidos e no mundo inteiro. Há uma jurisdição superior” , declarou nesta 5ª feira (22.ago.2024) em sessão do Parlamento.\nFormulário de cadastro alertas grátis do Poder360 concordo com os termos da LGPD . Inscreva-se Inscreva-se Amorim foi enviado pelo governo do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) à Venezuela para acompanhar a realização do pleito e manteve diálogo com o presidente Nicolás Maduro (Partido Socialista Unido da Venezuela, esquerda).\nEm entrevista à CNN , o assessor do petista sugeriu uma nova eleição. Como mostrou o Poder360 , a proposta de Lula já foi rejeitada por Maduro.\n“Se ambos os lados dizem que venceram, por que não realizar outra eleição em que se possam evitar os problemas que, dizem, contaminaram essa eleição? Se ela ganhou, provavelmente ganhará de novo, não?” , perguntou Amorim.\nNo entanto, nesta 5ª feira (22.ago), o TSJ validou a vitória do chavista nas eleições e destacou o “respaldo pelos registros emitidos pelas máquinas e total coincidência com os bancos de dados” , mas informou que não tornará as atas eleitorais públicas.\nEdmundo González, líder da oposição, rejeitou a decisão da Corte, baseando-se em uma contagem paralela que indicaria sua vitória.\nA disputa presidencial na Venezuela foi marcada por alegações de parcialidade e falta de independência do CNE (Conselho Nacional Eleitoral) e do TSJ, ambos alinhados ao governo.\nO Centro Carter criticou o pleito por não atender aos padrões internacionais de integridade eleitoral, indicando um “claro viés” em favor de Maduro.\nA OEA (Organização dos Estados Americanos) e uma missão do Conselho de Direitos Humanos da ONU demonstraram preocupação com a falta de independência das instituições venezuelanas. A OEA não reconheceu o resultado divulgado pelo CNE e solicitou a publicação das atas.\nA decisão do TSJ desta 5ª feira (22.ago) também implica em sanções contra González por suposto desacato à Justiça, aumentando as tensões políticas no país.",
