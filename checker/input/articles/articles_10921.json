    "text": "In a surprise move it has been announced that Mercedes-Benz will be joining the V8 Supercars race series as of the 2013 season. The move comes after Nissan announced earlier this year that it would provide a mix to usual Holden-Ford-only field from next year as well.\n(Image of current C-Class Coupe DTM German touring car shown)\nThe team won’t be an official Mercedes-Benz partner per se, instead, it will be an alliance between Erebus Motorsport and Stone Brothers Racing. Erebus Motorsport has been running the SLS GT in the Australia GT Championship for the past two years.\nThe Mercedes-Benz V8 Supercar will adopt the Car of the Future platform (COTF), and it will wear an E-Class-style body. Up to three vehicles wearing the three-pointed star will run in the series, with power coming from an AMG-tuned 5.0-litre V8 engine in specification to V8 Supercars regulations. Power is restricted to around 450kW.\nNew manufacturers joining the V8 Supercars series has been made possible thanks to new regulations which will come in for the 2013 season, and onwards. The most notable of changes is with the introduction of the COTF platform which has reduced the costs of running in the championship for all teams.\nNext year’s season is certainly anticipated to be an exciting one, with four different manufacturers, and four different sets of fans supporting the sport.",

According to the 7-day forecast, heavy rainfall is expected on 17 July, followed by consistent light to moderate showers until 22 July.\nWith many parts of Karnataka still struggling with deficient rain and parched fields, this shift comes as a double-edged sword — offering relief for some and potential disruption for others.\nHeavy Rainfall Forecast Today, Warnings Issued Across Karnataka\nThe IMD has predicted a generally cloudy sky with heavy rainfall on Wednesday (17 July), followed by light rain in the subsequent days. The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 30°C and 20°C respectively throughout the week.In addition to Bengaluru, several other districts have also been issued yellow alerts. These include Kodagu, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga, Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi, Vijayapura, Kolar and Chikkaballapur. Residents in these areas have been advised to stay vigilant for sudden downpours and potential localised flooding.\nOrange Alert for Coastal Karnataka, Schools Shut in Some Taluks\nWhile most of southern Karnataka will see moderate rain, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts have been issued an orange alert for 16 July due to the likelihood of very heavy rainfall. Authorities have declared a holiday for schools and anganwadis in Ullal and Bantwal taluks as a precautionary measure.\"With the volume of rainfall expected in the next few days, we are taking preventive steps to avoid any safety hazards, especially for children and commuters,\" local officials said.\nWatch Out for Landslides, Avoid Unnecessary Travel: IMD Warns\nThe IMD has also flagged risks of landslides in the hilly regions of Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru due to persistent rain. Travellers heading to these districts have been advised to avoid long journeys and exercise caution. \"Stay indoors unless absolutely necessary. Travel in these areas should be postponed until conditions improve,\" the weather office advised.What to Expect in Bengaluru This Week\nHere's a quick look at the IMD's forecast for Bengaluru:- 17 July: Heavy rain; yellow warning in place\nDespite the absence of warnings after 17 July, light showers will persist, potentially affecting daily commuters, especially during peak hours.

    "title": "Best New Meme Coins to Invest in This Month: BTFD Coin's Binance Listing Rumors Heat Up with Exclusive Presale Amid Turbo and PNUT Success",
    "text": "The world of meme coins is buzzing again! From wild surges to life-changing wealth, the crypto community has seen it all with tokens like Turbo (TURBO) and Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT) skyrocketing after their Binance debuts. But now, the rumor mill is ablaze with whispers about\nBTFD Coin (BTFD) being next in line for a Binance listing. With its booming presale, innovative features, and a passionate “Bulls Squad” community, BTFD is positioning itself as the next big thing.\nLet’s dive into what makes these meme coins the best new meme coins to invest in this month and why investors are flocking to BTFD.\nIf you’ve missed out on early-stage meme coin successes, BTFD might just be your golden ticket. Built for the daring, the “\nBuy The Dip” mantra has inspired a movement among crypto enthusiasts. And let’s not forget the Bulls Squad, the community-powered heart of BTFD, ready to seize every market dip and transform it into a moonshot opportunity.\nCurrently, in Stage 14, the BTFD presale has sold over 66 billion coins, raising a whopping $5.5 million from more than 9,200 Bulls. With its price at $0.00016 per coin, the presale is nearing its conclusion, where the listing price will jump to $0.0006.\nImagine this: If you invest $5,000 today in Stage 14, you’d secure 31,250,000 BTFD coins. Once the coin hits its listing price, your investment could grow to $18,750, a 275% return! With analysts eyeing even higher highs, BTFD is shaping up to be a portfolio essential.\nBTFD is more than just a meme coin; it’s an ecosystem. The P2E game, launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards while playing. Add the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got multiple ways to grow your BTFD holdings.\nThe crypto world is buzzing with speculation about a Binance listing for BTFD. If true, this would follow in the footsteps of Turbo and PNUT, both of which saw massive price surges post-listing. Plus, the\nBTFD Referral Program sweetens the deal, offering participants 10% rewards for successful referrals.\nThis combination of community strength, innovative features, and Binance rumors makes BTFD the hottest coin to watch this month.\nTurbo burst onto the scene with its AI-driven roots and landed a spot on Binance on September 16, 2024. The Binance listing immediately boosted its price by 12%, and investors who got in early saw life-changing gains.\nAs of January 2025, Turbo trades at $0.00623719, with a market cap of $423.31 million. Its burn mechanism, staking rewards, and partnerships with AI startups have kept the project relevant and innovative. The community is thriving, boasting over 500,000 members across social platforms.\nFor those who missed the initial rally, Turbo’s strong ecosystem and Binance backing make it a compelling investment to revisit.\nPNUT brought the meme coin craze to new heights when it was listed on Binance on November 20, 2024. Within 24 hours, PNUT soared 340%, making millionaires out of early adopters. One lucky investor turned $5,000 into $1.8 million during the frenzy.\nToday, PNUT trades at $0.002814 with a market cap of $280.6 million. Its focus on community-driven initiatives, such as the Peanut Playground metaverse, and its token burn mechanism, which removed 5 billion tokens in January 2025, have ensured ongoing interest and utility.\nWhile PNUT’s volatility is not for the faint of heart, its Binance success story proves the wealth-generating power of meme coins.\nGetting in on BTFD is simple and rewarding.
