    "title": "Las Vegas tourism dips 8% as social media claims city is 'too expensive'",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Las Vegas visitor numbers are down nearly 8% from last year, but convention traffic is up as the city faces mixed economic signals amid viral social media claims of tourism decline.\nLas Vegas has been getting significant attention on social media lately, with viral videos showing empty streets and comments about sky-high prices. But what's really happening in America's playground?\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the city welcomed 3.39 million visitors in March, down nearly 8% from the same period last year. Officials attribute this decline to a lighter event calendar and economic uncertainty.\n\"I think it's still pretty busy for what you can say is the slow time,\" said one visitor.\n\"I've spent money like a maniac,\" said another tourist.\nWhile leisure tourism shows signs of softening, business travel remains robust. More than 500,000 people attended trade shows in March, indicating strong convention traffic.\n\"I don't see a downfall at all,\" said a convention attendee.\nHotel metrics tell a more complex story. Occupancy rates have decreased slightly, especially midweek, while room rates have increased. However, revenue per available room has remained flat, suggesting a balancing act between pricing and demand.\n\"What we're looking at right now we think is just a downturn in business for a period of time. It used to be a pretty normal thing. It does not mean that the public should extrapolate that into being COVID-like or Great Recession-like, we do not see that right now. There's no evidence that it'll turn into something like that,\" said Steve Hill, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\nQuestions about potential layoffs at major resorts have also circulated online. When asked about staff reductions, only MGM Resorts responded, confirming they have closed some concierge desks while shifting to more digital and self-service options. The company stated affected employees have been reassigned to other positions.\nA spokesperson sent us an 'MGM Resorts Concierge Fact Sheet' saying: \"MGM Resorts is streamlining Concierge operations to better match evolving guest preferences. Guest demand for in-person service has declined, while self-service and digital concierge use is rapidly growing. We’re adapting to serve guests more efficiently without compromising service quality.\"\nDuring a quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Caesars Entertainment reported they don't anticipate the Las Vegas market softening and have contingency measures in place if it does.\nMGM held its own earnings call Wednesday, reporting decent first-quarter results despite some metrics dipping compared to last year. The company noted that 2023's numbers were boosted by the Super Bowl being held in Las Vegas.\nThe Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, addressed concerns about potential layoffs in a statement: \"All Culinary Union members employed on the Las Vegas Strip and in Downtown Las Vegas are protected by strong union contracts. Casino resorts are dynamic workplaces, and the companies are constantly making changes… that's why strong Culinary Union contracts are necessary and in place to protect workers. Culinary Union remains committed to ensuring that workers' rights are respected, their jobs are protected, and the union contract is fully enforced.\"",

    "text": "[Jon Stewart](https://www.nydailynews.com/2022/10/19/jon-stewart-addresses-ye-and-weird-jew-paranoia-bulls-t/)‘s emotional tribute to his late dog, Dipper, has bolstered donations to a local animal shelter. During his weekly hosting gig on [“The Daily Show,”](https://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show) the 61-year-old funnyman struck a somber yet sentimental tone, paying homage to the memory of Dipper. The Brindle pit bull, who previously lost one of his legs after being hit by a car in Brooklyn, was later adopted by Stewart and had been a part of his family for over 12 years. “Dipper passed away yesterday,” he said of his faithful furry friend on Monday’s “Moment of Zen” segment. “He was ready. He was tired, but I wasn’t.” “In a world of good boys, he was the best,” Stewart continued through tears. “He used to come to ‘The Daily Show’ every day. He was part of the OG ‘Daily Show’ dog crew. … And we’d come and tape and Dipper would wait for me to be done. He met actors and authors and presidents and kings. He did what the Taliban could not do, which is put a scare into Malala Yousafzai.” The [22-time Emmy winner](https://www.emmys.com/bios/jon-stewart)‘s tribute [led to an outpouring of financial support](https://www.tmz.com/2024/02/29/jon-stewart-animal-shelter-raise-donations-daily-show-tribute-dog-dies/) for [ Animal Haven](https://animalhaven.org/), the rescue shelter where he met his beloved pooch. [Tiffany Lacey](https://bfa.com/home/photo/5589306?person_id=76868&sort=asc&locations=SECOND%20floor%20nyc&page=1), the executive director of the Lower Manhattan-based nonprofit, said more than 500 people sent donations totaling almost $25,000 since Stewart mentioned them on “The Daily Show.” She told TMZ the funds will assist in providing essential resources for the no-kill shelter, including general care for their cats and dogs, veterinary services, and activities such as dog walks. The sudden influx of donations, she said, came at a critical time for Animal Haven — which is currently at full capacity, housing more than 100 rescue animals, including a newborn litter of 20 puppies.",

    "title": "Shawn Fain’s New Year’s Resolution Is to Lay the Ground for a National Strike - ZNetwork",
    "text": "Imagine it’s the evening of April 30, 2028. The nation is roiling as millions of workers coast to coast prepare to walk off the job in an unprecedented May Day national strike. Workers in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, grocery, high tech, hospitality, and public services have mobilized and committed to bring the economy to a halt unless their bold demands are met: Medicare for All, a $30/hour minimum wage, and a tax on billionaires to massively increase public education funding. That’s the sort of vision that United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain has challenged the rest of the labor movement to begin organizing toward. At the end of October, in announcing strike settlements at the Big Three auto companies, [Fain noted](https://twitter.com/UAW/status/1718764187755909181) that the UAW contracts all expire the day before May Day 2028. He urged other unions to align their contracts with the UAW. “If we’re truly going to take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the many and not the few, then it’s important that we not only strike, but that we strike together,” he said. Workers have organized national strikes in other countries, where labor movements are stronger and there’s a history of national bargaining around social demands. Not so in the US, where the post-WWII political establishment—too often with the complicity of union leaders—intentionally created and enforced a labor law framework that partitioned the working class by establishing bargaining at the enterprise level, rather than by sector or whole industries. In the US system, workers are left to fight separate battles, worksite by worksite, for health care, fair pay, and health and safety rights—things we’re more powerful fighting for together. Fain’s May Day throwdown takes aim at capital’s divide-and-conquer legal regime. But to be successful in 2028, the labor movement will need millions of workers to join in: those now in unions, who should begin to line up contracts for that decisive date, and many more who are not yet in unions but are beginning to organize. This vision is what makes the new surge of auto worker organizing the UAW is currently embarking on particularly momentous. In the wake of the UAW’s breakthrough strike and contract settlements at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, workers at the industry’s growing non-union plants—Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Hyundai, BMW, VW, Tesla, and more—are beginning to organize on a scale not seen in generations. Thousands of workers have signed union cards in the last few weeks. The UAW has dispatched organizers to non-union plants and launched a splashy national media campaign along with social media organizing tools. “When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won’t just be with the Big 3, but with the Big 5 or Big 6,” [Fain predicted](https://www.labornotes.org/2023/10/big-3-buckled-stand-strike-spread). That’s much easier said than done. Executives at Toyota et al. already are mounting anti-union campaigns, with carrots—raises of up to 11 percent—and sticks—anti-union meetings, videos, harassment of union leafleteers, and one-on-one lectures by supervisors about the evils of unions. These companies have control in the workplace and will stop at nothing to thwart the incipient worker rebellions. In the past, auto executives have hired the worst-of-the-worst union-busting law firms—outfits like Littler Mendelson, who are the brains and muscle behind Starbucks’ union-quashing efforts. Expect the same army of pinstriped busters this time around in auto plants. UAW members scored big when they struck and won contracts at the Big 3 that began to claw back the concessions of the last generation. It took hard work, and the divided ratification votes showed that UAW members are not done demanding their share. It will be an even bigger challenge—another order of magnitude harder—to beat Elon Musk and his fellow auto CEOs and successfully organize non-union auto workers on a mass basis. Yet we must all root for and materially support the auto workers, because their victories will lay the foundation for the vision Fain laid out, the opportunity to do battle for social and economic justice on a national, class-wide basis. Today the UAW represents only about 15 percent of the [990,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276474/automotive-industry-employees-in-the-united-states-by-sector/) US automobile and parts manufacturing workers. That’s down from a peak of 1.5 million UAW members [in 1979](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/09/15/uaw-membership-numbers-through-years/70865885007/), when 80 percent of US auto manufacturing was unionized and UAW contracts drove industry standards. The biggest automaker in the US? It’s no longer General Motors. In 2021 [Toyota beat GM](https://www.thedrive.com/news/43738/toyota-beat-gm-as-americas-1-automaker-for-the-first-time-ever-in-2021) to become number one in the US, churning out millions of cars and trucks at its [10 manufacturing plants](https://www.toyota.com/usa/operations/), all but one located in so-called “right to work” states where anti-union laws weaken worker organization and suppress wages. For years, UAW leaders gave lip service to organizing those and other plants. In the last decade, the union badly mangled efforts to organize at [Nissan](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/08/05/nissan-workers-reject-uaw-crucial-vote/542216001/) and [Volkswagen](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/uaw-works-council-tennessee-union-volkswagen/), in both cases underestimating the potency of the anti-union campaigns and underappreciating the need to build strong in-plant union committees. On Dec. 11, [Fain delivered a speech on Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/uaw.union/videos/2087492778271093) to autoworkers and supporters where he recounted the broader uprising that began during the UAW strike. At the non-union factories, “autoworkers weren’t just writing us messages, they were signing union cards,” he said. “They found old organizing websites—some made their own websites, and just started signing up. They were tuning in to our Facebook Live updates, our stories, our materials, they made their own stickers with our UAW wheel and posted them all over non-union plants.” Once the strike concluded in late October, momentum grew for signing union cards, the precondition for a union representation election. By law unions must get a minimum of 30 percent of workers to sign union authorization cards before they can request a vote conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. UAW organizers say they aim to get 70 percent sign-up at plants before filing, to ensure there’s enough support to overcome management opposition. VW workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee were the first to surpass the 30 percent threshold in their plant of 3,800. On Dec. 7, they took their campaign public, unveiling a video along with a website featuring a list of the [187 members of the in-plant Volunteer Organizing Committee](https://uaw.org/vw/) (VOC). As workers at other auto plants meet the 30 percent threshold, they too will go public. A confluence of factors is driving the momentum. To be sure, the gains UAW members made at the Big 3 are a huge inspiration for workers. But also motivating the union push are the punishing non-union working conditions. This year, VW eliminated two holidays and increased insurance costs for workers, according to Zack Curvin, a VW powertrain assembly line worker in Chattanooga. VW also instituted a line speedup, telling workers that the company wants to see “a car a minute off the line,” almost double the line speed of two years ago, Curvin told me, adding that VW has been reducing time for maintenance and workers often struggle with broken or substandard equipment. An autoworker I spoke with at Rivian’s 6,000-worker plant in Normal, Illinois said his colleagues were frustrated that the company was expecting workers to use vacation time or take unpaid “voluntary time off” when the plant shuts down for three weeks of retooling next spring. When Jeff Allen began working at Toyota’s massive Georgetown, Kentucky plant in 1994, “we had free health insurance and Toyota pretty much followed what the UAW had,” he told me. But over the years, Toyota shifted healthcare costs onto workers, trimmed retirement, and kept wages down. None of these indignities or austerity measures were because the companies were hurting financially. The “German Three”—BMW, Mercedes, and VW—made $460 billion in profits over the last decade. Toyota made $250 billion in profits in the same 10-year period, while opening a food bank for Allen and his 9,500 coworkers at the Georgetown plant, [according to the UAW](https://www.facebook.com/uaw.union/videos/2087492778271093). Workers at these and other plants have tried to organize and failed before, but this time feels different, they said. In the past, Allen said he and his coworkers “just leafleted and assumed people would come on board.” This time, “we’re going back to old school, talking to people one on one,” he told me. Yolanda Peoples, a 12-year VW assembly line worker, described to me how VOC members “are trying to hit every part of the plant, from young to old.” On national auto worker organizing calls, Peoples said, she’s gained skills and insights from other workers about how to approach workers who are on the fence or skeptical. Rather than barge ahead with a union rap, she’s practiced asking questions, drawing out worker concerns and hopes. “I’ll ask them, ‘Have you ever gone through anything that you wouldn’t want your son or daughter to go through?’ Make it more personal. Everyone has that one story,” she said. This daily organizing work is unflashy—but absolutely essential. Too many past organizing campaigns—not just the UAW’s failed attempts, but efforts by other unions in myriad industries—have faltered when organizers took organizing shortcuts, fell back on gimmicks, or underestimated the scale of employer resistance. They tried to “sell” workers on the union, rather than challenge workers to step up and make the union their own. They soft-pedaled the fight against the boss, rather than describing a power struggle between workers and management. To withstand the tornado of the full-blown anti-union campaign, organizers must place the power struggle front-and-center in conversations, and they must build a union structure inside the workplace that can withstand the hostile winds. That means recruiting respected workers on every shift, in every work area and department, to serve on the plant VOC so they can educate, unite, bolster, and move a majority of coworkers into action. It doesn’t matter how deeply felt the workplace issues are, how righteous the fight seems to be, how popular it is with the wider public, if there is not [a tight internal organizing structure that is tested through collective union actions](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/jane-mcalevey-collective-bargain-book-review/): vote yes petitions, sticker-up days, and other demonstrations of majority worker support. The harder the boss fight workers face, the more solid the structure needs to be—and the more often it needs to be tested. In Chattanooga, Curvin described how he and his fellow VOC members have talked to 85 percent of his line coworkers, and a majority have signed union cards. “I’m amazed at how quickly things have moved,” he said. “There’s a lot of strong will to help each other out.” A BMW worker in South Carolina described to me how he and his coworkers have identified every work area—bumper line, assembly, paint shop, body shop, and so on—and are methodically identifying which areas have VOC members and which don’t. That’s the sort of rigorous organizing that will be required to win. These initial organizing steps are a sign that workers and the UAW are keen to avoid repeating past mistakes. Still, there inevitably will be temptations to take organizing shortcuts, become enamored with glitzy media, or overvalue the public vibe or a politician’s endorsement. It will be important to bear in mind that the same UAW contracts that provide non-union workers the courage to stand up and fight also give the bosses of the multinational companies more incentive than ever before to fight the union. They have unlimited resources with which to wage that war, and surely will deploy them. But if the workers continue to organize in a disciplined manner, the coming months and years could see the UAW grow by the tens of thousands, or even more. That is an exciting prospect, not just for the workers in these plants, but for all of us in the labor movement who heard Fain’s call to arms and have circled May Day 2028 in our calendars.

    "text": "Firenze, calci e pugni allo stomaco e alla testa: anziano pestato a sangue in Santa Croce L'aggressione in pieno giorno scatenata da un rimprovero. Calci e pugni allo stomaco, sulla schiena e infine sulla testa. La vittima è un pensionato di 70 anni Un rimprovero ha scatenato una violenza inaudita. Un pensionato di 70 anni è stato brutalmente aggredito e picchiato da un uomo. È accaduto alle 13 di mercoledì in pieno centro storico, nella zona di Santa Croce. Le immagini di un video – diffuso da La Nazione – mostrano una violenza contro l’anziano che subito dopo è stato portato al pronto soccorso di Santa Maria Nuova: i medici gli hanno diagnosticato 21 giorni di prognosi. Le immagini mostrano l’anziano che si trova in via de’ Bentaccordi e si sta camminando in direzione Santa Croce. Ha solo il tempo di fare pochi passi perché di fronte si trova un uomo che lo aggredisce: l’anziano prova a scappare ma l’altro lo insegue fino a quando, una volta raggiunto, lo scaglia contro contro il muro. A questo punto l’anziano finisce per terra ma la furia dell’aggressione non si ferma. Calci e pugni allo stomaco, sulla schiena e infine sulla testa. La vittima si mette a urlare e a quel punto alcuni passanti vanno a vedere che cosa sia successo. Subito dopo chiamano il 118 mentre l’aggressore scappa e l’anziano rimane a terra. I medici arrivano poco dopo assieme ai carabinieri del nucleo radiomobile. L’uomo è stato aggredito perché aveva rimproverato una persona perché non teneva il suo cane al guinzaglio e poteva essere pericoloso: una volta avuta la notizia e assicuratosi che la vittima è in carico dei medici, i militari tornano in strada. La diffusione delle immagini – che non sono state riprese dalle telecamere di sorveglianza del Comune – spostano però la storia in un terreno ben diverso. Quello della violenza pura. I carabinieri devono ancora raccogliere il racconto della vittima, che è fondamentale per attivare una vera e propria inchiesta visto il nuovo codice di procedura penale modificato dall’ex ministra Cartabia. Nel frattempo i carabinieri stanno cercando nelle telecamere di sorveglianza di Palazzo Vecchio qualsiasi indizio che possa portare all’identificazione dell’aggressore che per due giorni è riuscito a sfuggire alle forze dell’ordine. L’uomo adesso rischia – sempre se ci sarà la querela della vittima – una denuncia per lesioni personali aggravate. In queste ore i militari stanno anche cercando di ricostruire l’esatta via di fuga dell’aggressore per riuscire eventualmente a risalire alla sua macchina. E soprattutto alla targa del mezzo che potrebbe «tradire» l’aggressore, dando l’identità del suo proprietario.

    "title": "Tibetan political leader ‘optimistic’ about passage of US bill on Tibet — Radio Free Asia",
    "text": "The leader of Tibet’s government-in-exile on Wednesday said he was hopeful that a U.S. bill urging China to resolve issues related to Tibet through dialogue with the Dalai Lama or Tibetan leaders would be approved by the Senate.\nThe Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act, also known as the Resolve Tibet Act, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 15.\nThe bill, which also empowers the State Department to counter disinformation on Tibet,\nwas unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, advancing the bill to the Senate floor.\n“Fortunately, His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s support has garnered bipartisan backing for the Tibetan cause,” Sikyong Penpa Tsering, the democratically elected leader of the Central Tibetan Administration, told RFA in an interview in Washington.\n“We are optimistic that this bill will soon be enacted into law,” he said. “We hope and aim for passage [of the bill in the Senate] before the U.S. elections” in November.\n“Currently, we have progressed about 75% towards the goal,” added Tsering, who earlier this week met with key lawmakers, including Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, one of those who introduced the legislation.\nSikyong Penpa Tsering meets with Sen. Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in Washington, DC, April 15, 2024. (Office of Tibet, Washington, DC)\nOthers involved in drafting the bipartisan bill include Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, and Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\nBill’s highlights\nThe Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 uprising against rule by China, which invaded the independent Himalayan country in 1950.\nSince then, Beijing has sought to legitimize Chinese rule through the suppression of dissent and policies undermining Tibetan culture and language.\nThe bill calls for a resumption in negotiations between Chinese officials and the Dalai Lama or his representatives. Since 2010, no formal dialogue has happened and Chinese officials continue to make unreasonable demands of the Dalai Lama as a condition for further dialogue.\nIt also urges China to recognize the rights of Tibetans whose status needs to be negotiated according to international law, Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Radio Free Asia.\nThe bill states that claims made by Chinese officials and by the Chinese Communist Party that Tibet has been a part of China since ancient times are historically inaccurate.\nIt also challenges China’s claim that Tibet is restricted to the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and says Tibet includes the Tibetan-populated regions of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, in addition to the TAR.\nSikyong Penpa Tsering (2nd from L), Richard Gere (R), chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet, and Tenchoe Gyatso (R), the organization's president, meet with Rep. Young Kim (2nd from R), a Republican from California, in Washington, DC, April 16, 2024. (Office of Tibet, Washington, DC)\nUnder Chinese President Xi Jinping, China has used harsh tactics to promote party ideology over local traditions , cultures and religious practices.\nIn the Tibet Autonomous Region and the southwestern Chinese provinces where many Tibetans live, that has meant prohibiting photographs of the Dalai Lama, pressuring monks to denounce the spiritual leader, restricting communications with people outside of the area, and forcing Tibetan children to attend “colonial” boarding schools.\n‘Raise pressure’\nThe bill now heads to the Senate, and can take one of two directions — a shortcut that may result in a likely Senate approval before June, or the standard route, which may extend into late July, said Tsering.\n“I think that the foundational support and the bipartisan support that we have, it will put us on an excellent path, going forward, in the passage of this bill through the Senate,” Sen. Jeff Merkley, a co-sponsor of the bill, told RFA after the Senate committee’s vote.\nTencho Gyatso, president of the International Campaign for Tibet, and American actor Richard Gere, the organization’s chair, accompanied Tsering to the meetings with key lawmakers.\nThe Senate committee’s vote shows that “Congress is making it a priority to resolve China’s brutal occupation of Tibet through dialogue,” Gyatso said.\n“China needs to get back to negotiations with Tibetan leaders, and this bill will raise the diplomatic pressure on China significantly,” she added.\nIn his interview with RFA, Tsering expressed concern about the impact of China’s assimilation policies, particularly on China’s increasing restrictions on linguistic and cultural rights in Tibet and its use of the boarding schools where rights groups have said Tibetan children are forcefully separated from their families and learn from Chinese-language curriculum.\n“If this trend persists over the next decade, it will pose a significant challenge, transforming Tibetans into Chinese,” he said.\n“Concerns about this policy are high among Tibetans from Tibet,” he added. “We are closely monitoring and analyzing its implications.”\nAdditional reporting by Nordhey Dolma and Yeshi Tashi for RFA Tibetan.
