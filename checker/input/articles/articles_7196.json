    "text": "[Business](/business) AI math doesn't always add up You might be better at solving grade-school math problems than AI is. An Apple study found that artificial intelligence models get confused by irrelevant information in math problems. For example, researchers posed this basic math problem to several AI models: “Oliver picks 44 kiwis on Friday. Then he picks 58 kiwis on Saturday. On Sunday, he picks double the number of kiwis he did on Friday. How many kiwis does Oliver have?” All AI models correctly answered “190.” But when researchers added the irrelevant phrase “five of them were a bit smaller than average,” most AI models answered “185” because they incorrectly subtracted the below-average kiwis. Researchers said there are “significant limitations” in AI’s ability to perform mathematical reasoning because models are “pattern matching” for numbers without truly understanding language. Coming attractions Movie chains will invest $2.2 billion over the next three years to upgrade their theaters, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. The industry group says theaters will add new food and beverage options, create “family entertainment options” like arcades and upgrade “core site elements” such as air-conditioning and seats. Among the chains slated for upgrades are AMC Entertainment and Regal Cinemas, which have a large presence on Long Island. Halliburton: Cyberattack cost $35M After initially saying an August cybersecurity attack would not have “a material impact” on its financials, energy industry services provider Halliburton disclosed in a government filing that the attack cost it at least $35 million in “lost or delayed revenue.” Halliburton said the attackers, linked to the ransomware gang RansomHub, stole data from its systems. Halliburton hasn’t disclosed what data was accessed or if it paid a ransom. Chipotle serves up ‘virtual recruiter’ Chipotle Mexican Grill is rolling out an artificial intelligence assistant it hopes will cut the time it takes to hire workers by as much as 75%. The virtual recruiter, known as Ava Cado, will be available at the chain’s more than 3,500 restaurants. The company said Ava will collect applicants’ information, answer their questions about the company, book meetings and send offers to candidates selected by humans. — BLOOMBERG NEWS Updated 52 minutes ago 'Disney on Ice' preview ...

Liu Zhenli, miembro de la Comisión Militar Central de China y jefe del Departamento de Estado Mayor Conjunto de la Comisión Militar Central, y Charles Brown, presidente del Estado Mayor Conjunto de Estados Unidos, sostuvieron una videollamada el 21 de diciembre, dijo el portavoz del ministerio Wu Qian durante una conferencia de prensa. Los altos funcionarios mantuvieron un cándido y profundo intercambio de opiniones sobre la implementación del consenso alcanzado entre los jefes de Estado de los dos países en San Francisco y sobre asuntos de interés común, destacó Wu. China espera que la parte estadounidense trabaje con China para impulsar el sano y constante desarrollo de las relaciones entre los ejércitos de los dos países con base en la igualdad y el respeto mutuo, dijo Wu.

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
