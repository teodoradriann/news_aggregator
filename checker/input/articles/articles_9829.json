    "text": "El Papa ha pedido a los gobernantes que \"hagan todo lo posible\" para lograr un alto el fuego en Gaza un día después de que Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar hayan apelado a Israel y al Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) a negociar el fin de la guerra sobre la 'hoja de ruta' presentada la víspera por el presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden. El documento de negociación incluye un alto el fuego en Gaza y la liberación de rehenes y detenidos. \"Apelo a la sabiduría de los gobernantes para que cese la escalada y se haga todo lo posible en el diálogo y la negociación\", ha señalado el Pontífice tras el rezo del ángelus de este domingo. Del mismo modo ha instado a los fieles a no olvidarse de rezar por la paz en \"la atormentada Ucrania, en Palestina, en Israel y en Myanmar\". Además ha pedido oraciones por la situación en Sudán, \"donde la guerra que dura ya más de un año aún no ha encontrado una solución de paz\", ha señalado. \"Que se silencien las armas -ha manifestado -, y con el compromiso de las autoridades locales y de la comunidad internacional, se lleve ayuda a la población, y los numerosos desplazados y refugiados de Sudán puedan encontrar acogida y protección en los países vecinos\". El Papa iba a trasladarse esta mañana a la basílica de San Juan de Letrán para la celebración del Corpus Christi, pero por la intensa lluvia en Roma ha permanecido en el Palacio Apostólico del Vaticano. Un gesto de cariño catedral de Roma que no hacía desde el año 2017, cuando precisamente estableció trasladar la fiesta al domingo, y no celebrarla tradicionalmente el jueves. Antes del rezo del ángelus, asomado a la ventana del Palacio Apostólico, el Pontífice ha recordado que la Eucaristía \"evoca ante todo la dimensión del don\", porque Jesús \"toma el pan no para consumirlo solo, sino para partirlo y darlo a los discípulos, revelando así su identidad y su misión\". Jesús \"entregó\" toda su vida, ha dicho el Papa Francisco. Así ha señalado: \"celebrar la Eucaristía y comer este Pan, como hacemos especialmente los domingos, no es un acto de culto desvinculado de la vida o un simple momento de consuelo personal. En cambio, con su gesto, Jesús nos hace capaces de convertirnos también en pan partido para los demás, de compartir lo que somos y lo que tenemos\". Francisco ha subrayado que estamos llamados a ser \"eucarísticos\", es decir a ser personas que \"ya no viven para sí mismas\", sino que \"saben hacer de su vida un don para los demás\". Así ha dicho que \"gracias a la Eucaristía\" los fieles se convierten \"en profetas y constructores de un mundo nuevo\". Y ha asegurado: \"cuando superamos el egoísmo y nos abrimos al amor, cuando cultivamos los lazos de fraternidad, cuando participamos en los sufrimientos de nuestros hermanos y compartimos nuestro pan y nuestros recursos con los necesitados, cuando ponemos nuestros talentos a disposición de todos, entonces partimos el pan de nuestra vida como Jesús\".

    "text": "The 800 sq. ft. condo on W. Bay Dr. is where the dreams of Basil Botetzayas&apos; family came true.\"That was a central place for the whole family,\" he said. \"A lot of history, birthdays over the years, vacations.\"Basil&apos;s parents bought the condo in 1989. His mom, Bessie, passed in 2005. His dad, George, died in 2021. It went into foreclosure and was sold at auction.The $156,000 surplus, the equity George and Bessie had built up, was sent to the Pinellas County court registry.\"I thought of all places, if it&apos;s sitting with the court, that&apos;s the safest place for it to be,\" he said.But documents show that fraudsters enlisted the help of an attorney in South Florida to acquire $148,000 of George and Bessie&apos;s surplus money. A closing statement shows signatures supposedly from George and Bessie. But they were signed in 2024, well after both died.Wire transfer orders show someone used a driver&apos;s license to identify themselves as Bessie and George to a notary in Minnesota, and requested the money be sent to LLCs.\"That&apos;s the sad reality,\" said his attorney, Shant Melkonian of Tampa. \"He was a victim without knowing it was a victim.\"A Pinellas judge has ordered the attorney in South Florida - whose name we are withholding - to return the money. Melkonian says it&apos;s likely that attorney was duped by a web of burner phones and fake IDs. Thus, that money is gone. READ: Double murder suspect arrested after woman, child found stabbed to death in Dover Melkonian says state legislators should shore up statute 45.032, which says the clerk \"may\" establish a reasonable requirement that the owner of record prove his identity before receiving the disbursement. He wants them to change the word \"may\" to \"must.\"\"Basil&apos;s story is really a story of every Floridian that owns property that has maybe gone through a foreclosure and has surplus funds in the registry of court,\" said Melkonian.Basil says he will never stop fighting for his parents&apos; dream of a better life. They came from Greece with nothing but suitcases.\"To take that away from their legacy and what they wanted to leave for their family,\" he said. \"This really is really hard.\"FOX 13 reached out to the attorney in South Florida who filed the paperwork for the fraudsters to get George and Bessie&apos;s money, and he said he was unable to comment because there is an ongoing criminal investigation.The Pinellas County sheriff&apos;s office also was unable to comment.The clerk in Pinellas County, who held those funds, says in releasing them it was just complying with a court order.

    "title": "Morgan Rogers impressed by England boss Thomas Tuchel's 'aura and demeanour' - Limerick Live",
    "text": "Aston Villa forward Morgan Rogers says Thomas Tuchel’s “aura” could help fire England to World Cup glory next year.\nTuchel, who began work as Gareth Southgate’s successor in January, met up with his players for the first time on Monday ahead of qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.\nThe German held a team meeting on Monday night where he outlined his mission for glory in North America next summer and Rogers said he has never worked with a manager with such presence.\n“When I met him his aura and demeanour, it’s hard to describe but he has that level of confidence, that level of respect already,” he said.\n“The presence is a bit different. Certain managers have different ways about them. Certainly his aura is one I’ve not experienced before. That’s different to what I’ve faced before.\n“You can see the way he is, the way he acts. He has been so chilled and calm. But when it is time to work, it is time to work.\n“(Winning the World Cup) is the only goal, he was very clear and transparent with what he wants to do, how he wants to do it, how he wants to go about it, what he sees in us, and what we need to improve.\n“It was very straight-up, no cutting round corners. It was straight and that’s how he is. The best way to get information across is to be like that.”\nRogers could well be one of the key players in the US next summer given his meteoric rise since joining Villa from Middlesbrough at the start of 2024.\nHe has helped Villa through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and Champions League, with Unai Emery’s men also in the race for the top four in the Premier League.\nRogers has come a long way since he used to play against Jude Bellingham at Under-15s level, with the pair now competing against each other for a spot in the England team.\n“I don’t really see it as a rivalry. That’s more of a fan thing where they’ll pitch us against each other to start,” he added.\n“When I’m here I don’t think about that at all. I want to play every game, of course, but you don’t really see it as competition. You’re just friends enjoying the moment and experience.\n“When we were Under-15s, I think we had Birmingham in our group so we played them home and away. I remember that one vividly, I always bring it up to him. He’s never beaten me.\n“He’s always had a mouth on him. Always a wind-up. But we’ve had a really good relationship and to be with him now is really nice.\n“Our careers and paths have been completely different but we have always been in contact along the journey which is really nice and always been not far from each other where we grew up. It makes it a bit sweeter. It’s really nice.”\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",

    "text": "Andalucía Estas son las carreteras que en este momento sufren cortes o están cerradas al tráfico por los efectos de la DANA Doce de ellas en la provincia de Cádiz, tres en Sevilla y dos en Granada. La Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT) mantiene con cortes o cerradas al tráfico a las 9,00 horas de este viernes, 1 de noviembre, un total de 17 carreteras en Andalucía por inundación de la calzada a causa de la DANA que viene afectando a la comunidad durante los últimos días, [doce de ellas en la provincia de Cádiz](https://www.eldebate.com/sociedad/20241101/dana-sigue-curso-esperan-fuertes-tormentas-andalucia_241091.html), tres en Sevilla y dos en Granada. Según detalla la web de la DGT, en Cádiz permanecen cerradas al tráfico la A-393 entre Espera y Arcos de la Frontera, la CA-3113 en la carretera al Portal, la CA-5101 entre La Garrapata y Gibalbín, la CA-5200 y la CA-6200 en Alcalá de los Gazules, la CA-6101 en Coto de Bornos, la CA-6105 en Fuensanta y la CA-9101 entre Olvera y La Muela. Otras cuatro carreteras de la provincia de Cádiz presentan cortes parciales y circulación difícil: la A-408 entre El Almendral y Torre Alta, la CA-3101 en Macharnudo Alto, la CA-3108 en Estella del Marqués y la CA-3205 en Chiclana de la Frontera. En la provincia de Sevilla son tres las carreteras afectadas por inundaciones, una de ellas –la SE-6300– permanece cortada en Lebrija, mientras que las dos restantes presentan cortes parciales y circulación difícil. Se trata, en concreto, de la SE-3201 a su paso por Sevilla y la SE-4104 en Alcolea del Río, en el kilómetro 4. El resto de carreteras cerradas al tráfico en Andalucía se localizan en Granada. Son dos, la A-4200, entre Río de Baza y Benamaurel, del kilómetro 3 a 11, y la GR-4104 entre El Bejarín y Benalúa del kilómetro 15 a 16. Desactivado el aviso rojo en Huelva La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha desactivado a las 9,00 horas de este viernes, 1 de noviembre, el aviso rojo que permanecía vigente en algunas zonas de la provincia de Huelva en el marco de la DANA que viene afectando a España esta semana, y por la que ya se han acumulado casi 1.800 incidencias en el conjunto de Andalucía. En concreto, el total acumulado de emergencias que ha dejado el temporal en la comunidad autónoma andaluza asciende ya a 1.767, de las que 523 se han atendido en la provincia de Cádiz, 478 en Málaga, 223 en Granada, 211 en Sevilla, 152 en Almería, 51 en Jaén y 33 en Córdoba, según ha detallado este viernes a primera hora de la mañana en un comunicado el Centro de Coordinación de Emergencias (Cecem 112), adscrito a la Consejería de la Presidencia, Interior, Diálogo Social y Simplificación Administrativa. Durante la pasada madrugada, la Aemet activó el aviso rojo por lluvias en el Litoral onubense y en las comarcas de Arévalo y el Condado hasta las 9,00 horas, cuando ha quedado desactivado. No obstante, la Aemet mantiene activados durante toda la jornada de este viernes avisos de nivel naranja en toda la provincia de Huelva por riesgo importante de lluvias por las que se podrían acumular entre 30 y 40 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, según informa la agencia meteorológica en su página web. Además, la provincia de Sevilla se encuentra bajo aviso de nivel amarillo, al menos hasta las 10,00 horas de este viernes por riesgo de lluvias que podrían dejar hasta 20 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora.",

    "title": "Russia retakes some land hard won by Ukraine during counteroffensive - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russia has recaptured land hard won by Ukrainian troops at the peak of their summer counteroffensive in the south, making progress around the southern village of Robotyne.\nThe situation has reinforced the war’s latest reality: With their counteroffensive stalled, Ukrainian troops are now on the back foot in many places. Besides Robotyne in the south, they are also struggling in the east, having all but retreated from the town of Marinka, officials said this week.\nDeepening their challenges, Ukraine is increasingly worried that its military will not have the resources to keep up the fight. The United States announced Wednesday that it was releasing the last remaining Congress-approved package of military aid available to Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\n“Now we are losing some fields, but if the US aid is delayed, we will begin to lose towns,” Yehor Chernev, the deputy chair of the Ukrainian parliament’s committee on national security, defense and intelligence, said in an interview last week. “Without American ammunition, we are beginning to lose territory that was hard won this summer.”\nFor weeks, reluctance by Republican lawmakers in Congress to sustain assistance for Ukraine as the war stretches into another new year has thwarted Washington’s plans to send Ukraine more military aid. Congress declined again last week to pass a $50 billion security package for Ukraine, pushing back negotiations to next year.\nAlthough some military aid could still flow from a separate program overseen by the Pentagon, the Biden administration is now tapping into the last remaining funds already approved by Congress. A $250 million package announced Wednesday — which includes air defense equipment, artillery shells, and more than 15 million rounds of small arms ammunition — is likely the final tranche of available funding, according to American officials.\n“When that one is done,” the National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters last week, “we will have no more replenishment authority available to us.”\nAdvertisement\nThe Ukrainian military says its troops are facing shortages of critical equipment and ammunition. Some soldiers and commanders have said the shortfall has led them to scale back some operations and move to a defensive strategy.\nThe situation around the village of Robotyne, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, may be a case in point.\nWestern-trained and -equipped Ukrainian brigades retook the village in August after weeks of fighting. But the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said Wednesday that Russian forces had now retaken positions captured by Ukraine during the counteroffensive, “likely after Ukrainian forces withdrew to more defensible positions near Robotyne for the winter.”\nRussian troops have recently advanced from the southwest and east, pushing from Verbove, a nearby village that Ukrainian troops tried unsuccessfully to capture this summer to extend the bulge they had created in Russia’s defenses, according to the ISW and open-source maps of the battlefield.\nRussia’s advances have been limited so far. The open-source battlefield maps show that its forces have barely recaptured a few square miles of territory on the flanks of Robotyne. But Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, the head of Ukraine’s forces in the south, acknowledged to the BBC on Wednesday that “the situation in our sector is extremely difficult.”\nEvgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed head of the part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia claimed to have annexed last year, told Russian television this week that he hoped Russian troops would soon retake Robotyne and reach the starting line of Ukraine’s counteroffensive.\nAdvertisement",
