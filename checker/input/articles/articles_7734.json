    "title": "#11 Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.\nTeniendo en cuenta el contexto, que vox es un partido de gente que ha demostrado tener poca capacidad de gestionar, que es un partido para hacer ruido en la oposición más que para gobernar (igual que podemos en este punto), y que esta crisis de los menores no es ni de lejos representativo del problema inmigratorio.\nPero hay que reconocer que esto es un gesto de honestidad que no recordamos en la política española. Renunciar a poltronas porque se han incumplido puntos que eran importantes para ellos desde el punto de vista de programa. Sobre cualquier otro partido (desde el PP a indepes o el psoe) hay cientos de ejemplos de lo contrario, de aferrarse al sillón y capear las preguntas con una desvergüenza acojonante.",

    "title": "Study: Popular artificial sweetener linked to blood clots, risk of heart disease",
    "text": "New research from the Cleveland Clinic shows that erythritol, a popular artificial sweetener, may increase the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.Researchers tested healthy participants who had fasted overnight. They were given either a drink containing 30 grams of erythritol or 30 grams of sugar. Blood tests showed that erythritol levels spiked dramatically — by a thousandfold — while blood sugar levels only increased slightly.But what was particularly concerning to me was that erythritol made platelets much more active. Platelets are blood cells that help form clots, which can break away and travel to the heart or brain, potentially causing a heart attack or stroke.The study found that drinking a beverage with erythritol more than doubled the risk of blood clotting, whereas sugar did not have the same effect. What’s alarming is that this result was observed with just a single serving of 30 grams of erythritol, an amount typically found in sugar-free sodas or muffins.Erythritol is classified as “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS, by the FDA. That’s primarily because it’s a sugar alcohol naturally found in some fruits and fermented foods. However, it's also produced commercially by fermenting corn or plant sugars. It’s about 70% as sweet as sugar but has almost no calories. You’ll find it in products like Truvia, some Splenda items and many low-calorie foods including ice cream, candy, gum, cookies, protein bars and items geared toward the keto diet.While erythritol and other low-calorie sweeteners are often recommended for people with obesity, diabetes or metabolic syndrome to reduce sugar intake, it’s important to note that these folks already are at a higher risk of cardiovascular events.Now, this latest study was small and only involved 20 participants. But it adds to similar findings from a 2023 study where erythritol levels remained high for up to three days after consumption.An analysis of over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that people with the highest erythritol levels were twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke.Given these concerns, it’s best to err on the side of caution and consider limiting or avoiding products with erythritol, especially if you have existing cardiac disease or diabetes.This Week on ‘The Dr. Nandi Show’Dr. Nandi talks with practitioners who use natural remedies to cure common ailments.

Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.
