    "title": "The Tinkerbox, handcrafted zero waste brand in Singapore",
    "text": "It all started back in 2019, when Kay’s friend asked her for a simple request—to sew.\nAt the time, the friend was assembling a group of volunteers to sew reusable cloth pads from donated fabric such as towels and shirts. The purpose was to donate to girls in Kenya who would usually miss one week of school every month due to their period.\n“Purchasing disposable feminine care [products] for them was not feasible,” Kay shared. “Not only was the recurring cost prohibitive, the village lacked the basic waste management services that we take for granted.”\nThis simple request then became a gateway for Kay to join more similar outreach programmes, where she would conduct “sew your own [pads]” workshops with the friend.\nAnd eventually, it also became the reason behind the launch of her handmade zero waste store called The Tinkerbox .\nFrom volunteer work to entrepreneurship While browsing through the brand’s website, I noticed that Kay credits much of the business’s start to this volunteer work.\nShe explained that one day, a participant of their workshops asked her and her friend if they too used cloth pads.\nBefore then, Kay had never even considered using them herself.\n“They were for [the] less privileged, not me,” she recalled thinking.\nWith the question lingering on her mind, Kay said, “I made the decision that day to try. I figured it doesn’t matter if I like them or if I decide it’s not for me. As long as I’ve tried them to decide for myself, I could speak authentically.”\nSo she gave herself a week and started off by using liners.\nAt the end of the week, she felt rejuvenated and gave all her disposable liners away and never looked back. She could only describe the experience as life changing as it was “so incredibly comfortable”.\nSewing her hope for sustainability in each product This led to her being more open to sustainable products and she happily took on requests from her friend to sew more items. This included wipes and a cup holder for her non-standard shaped reusable coffee cup.\nLoving her creations, this friend encouraged Kay to share them on social media, and the orders asking to purchase them came flooding in.\nTo accommodate the sales, she decided to launch The Tinkerbox and turn this project into a practical venture.\nBranding itself as a creative studio, Kay’s intention with it is to handcraft reusable fabric alternatives for her customers to live their “best zero waste life”.\nAs for the name, it was a homage to her father, a retired aircraft engineer who influenced her to start tinkering with things from a young age.\nThe “box” part referred to two other aspirations she had: that it would be like a jack-in-the-box (full of surprises) and as a reminder to think unconventionally (outside the box).\nAt the start, The Tinkerbox only sold cloth pads like the ones she would donate to Kenya. But its catalogue has since expanded to include other non-feminine care items.\nCurrently, you can find products such as:\nWaterproof soap keepers for bar soaps and solid shampoos (S$15 to S$20) Coffee cup straps that clip on to any reusable cups (S$10 to S$15) Cutlery pouches with a removable waterproof and greaseproof lining (S$17 to S$22) Dog treat pouches that’s greaseproof and food safe (S$15) One of her bestsellers, aside from the cloth pads, is the reusable snack baggies (S$20 to S$26). They’re made to be waterproof and greaseproof, and are meant to replace single-use food bags.\nSome other lifestyle products Kay sells are scrunchies, mobile wristlets, bookmarks, and coasters. Called “The Scrappies”, these collections are made using remnant fabrics from her other projects.\nIn other words, Kay avoids wastage and tries to practice her zero waste philosophy even on the manufacturing level. Each piece is also sewn by herself, reflecting a rather slow fashion approach to the business.\nNo plans on giving up despite the uphill battle Speaking frankly, the founder shared that Singaporeans still have a long way to go in terms of sustainability and zero waste lifestyles.\n“It’s still in its infancy. Many Singaporeans are not interested in practising a zero waste lifestyle,” Kay stated. One factor she attributes to this is that some find sustainability to be an inconvenience.\n“If you look at the amount of waste and types of waste in the rubbish bins, you’ll see a tremendous amount of single-use [products]. At the moment, it’s not so much the gaps in the market but it’s [about] expanding the market.”\nThis is a key reason that she has continued on with The Tinkerbox as well.\nHowever, she acknowledges that it can be challenging to go completely zero waste in Singapore. Many of the food resources are imported and some items just don’t have a zero waste alternative, such as milk.\nIn lieu of that, though, she reminded that there are low-hanging fruits. For example, bringing your own water bottles, lunchboxes, and cutleries when going out.\nAs for the business itself, Kay preferred to keep the financial figures confidential but she confided that it’s financially operable. And thus far, with this being her full-time career, it seems to be working out for her.\nThough, she admitted that trying to change people’s ways can sometimes feel like an uphill battle. But she’s determined to play her part in changing the local zero waste landscape.\n“My wishes for The Tinkerbox are to continue bringing awareness and education that avoiding single-use and choosing to reuse isn’t inconvenient or difficult, and it isn’t a goal that’s all or nothing,” Kay expressed.\n“I want to help people see that with small changes to the systems in our lives, aspiring towards zero waste can be fun.”\nSo you’re likely to find Kay joining more pop-up events and collaborating with other local zero waste stores in the near future. Through this, she hopes to not only get more brand awareness but also to remind Singaporeans that going zero waste can be as simple as starting with a cloth pad.\nLearn more about The Tinkerbox here .

    "title": "America's looming hospital bed crisis: How shortages could put patients at risk",
    "text": "UCLA researchers predict a severe nationwide hospital bed shortage in the next seven years. At the same time, we'll have more people over the age of 65 than people under 18. That may also drive the need for more hospital beds.\nResearchers show how this can affect all of us, and how we can prevent a critical hospital bed shortage.\nIf you go to the emergency room and doctors determine you need to be admitted, it can be a long wait.\n\"Our mean boarding time right now is somewhere between 24 and 35 hours,\" said UCLA Hospitalist Dr. Richard Leuchter.\nHe said during peak times patients can wait up to 100 hours, and that's nationwide.\n\"In the decade leading up to the COVID pandemic, the national hospital bed occupancy was at about 64%, but something changed during the pandemic. Our hospital occupancy nationwide is actually 75 percent now,\" he said.\nIn about seven years, Leuchter and his research team says we're headed for another 10-point increase.\n\"That really sets the stage for a hospital bed shortage, which we show may occur as soon as 2032 if we don't take any action,\" said Leuchter.\nSo what's driving this dangerous trend? Not the number of people getting hospitalized. That's holding steady for now. Rather, Leuchter blames the looming crisis on the closure of hospitals bought by private investors for profit and a significant reduction in healthcare workers needed to staff those beds.\n\"What we need to do from the supply side is mitigate those staffing shortages,\" he said.\nStrategies include increasing the pipeline of new healthcare professionals and addressing the needs of the ones we already have.\n\"Like provider burnout, changing reimbursement schemes, compensation,\" Leuchter said.\nOn the demand side, UCLA is offering an emerging healthcare delivery strategy to reduce patient admissions. Their model is called the Next Day Clinic.\n\"Instead of admitting them, send them to our high acuity clinic where we treat them for things like heart failure or pneumonia. Try to take what would historically be inpatient care and replace it with outpatient care,\" he said.\nThe Next Day Clinic model was pioneered at Olive View and now being used at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center avoids hundreds of hospitalizations per year. Other institutions are also adopting this new system.",

    "title": "He survives the hurricane by clinging to a cooler",
    "text": "The US Coast Guard announced the dramatic rescue of a boat captain who survived the storm by clinging to a cooler in the Gulf of Mexico after the ship sank caused by Hurricane Milton. Milton left at least 16 dead in its wake in Florida, authorities said, with about 2.5 million homes and businesses remaining without power Friday despite a less intense disaster than expected. “We did not experience the worst scenario, but we were affected,” Ron DeSantis, governor of this southeastern American state, said on Friday. The death toll stands at at least 16: six in St. Lucie County, four in Volusia County, three across Polk and [Orange](/tag/Orange) and Citrus counties, two in the city of St. Petersburg, and one in Tampa, according to local authorities. Milton reached the west coast of Florida on Wednesday evening as a Category 3 hurricane, on the Saffir-Simpson scale of 5, then made its way inland, before gaining the Atlantic the following morning. Its passage caused numerous tornadoes and devastated a region already devastated by the powerful Hurricane Helene about two weeks earlier. A landscape of desolation In Siesta Key, in Sarasota Bay where the hurricane made landfall, residents who had evacuated gathered Friday to see the damage. “We’re told it was better than we feared, but when I look closer and take a drive, I see we’ve been hit very hard,” said Mark Horner, a 67-year-old resident. , at AFP. Here, Milton left a landscape of desolation, uprooting trees, flooding streets, tearing off at least one roof, and strewing the locality with various debris. Florida, the third most populous state in the country and which attracts many tourists, is used to hurricanes. But climate change, by warming the seas, makes their rapid intensification more likely and increases the risk of more powerful phenomena, scientists warn. Warming increases its power According to an analysis released Friday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) science network, Milton’s rainfall was about 20 to 30 percent higher due to climate change and its winds were 10 percent more intense. Without global warming, the hurricane would have made landfall in Florida as a category 2 instead of 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which measures the intensity of the winds, concluded the WWA. However, for each increase in category, the risk of damage is generally multiplied by four, estimates the American Oceanic and Atmospheric Observation Agency (NOAA). If the damage is impressive in places, the worst seems to have been avoided, the hurricane having “weakened before making landfall”, noted the governor of the state on Thursday, estimating that the marine submersion “was not as significant than that observed for Hurricane Helene. Search operations continued Friday, and the Coast Guard announced the spectacular rescue of a boat captain who survived the storm by clinging to an ice chest in the Gulf of Mexico. The day before, Joe Biden had called on the population to “stay indoors” for the moment, in particular to avoid “downed power lines, debris, and washed out roads”. The two hurricanes, which occurred a few weeks before an extremely close presidential election, took on a political dimension, with Republicans and Democrats arguing over disaster aid. (afp)",

    "text": "Louisville police chief on paid leave for response to sexual harassment claims\nPublished in\n[News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/)\nLEXINGTON, Ky. — Fresh on the heels of the fiasco in which the Louisville Metro Police Department arrested the world’s top male golfer during the PGA Championship only to drop all charges when they turned out to be unjustified, the long-troubled department is embroiled in another scandal — this one involving its police chief.\nIn a hastily called news conference Wednesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg announced that Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel was placed on paid administrative leave because of how she handled a workplace sexual harassment “allegation involving LMPD officers.”\nGreenberg said the allegations didn’t involve Gwinn-Villaroel, but instead how she handled the claims once reported to her.\nLouisville’s NBC affiliate, WAVE 3, reported that the allegations surfaced at a recent meeting of the chief’s command staff.\nAccording to a recording of the meeting obtained and aired in part by the station, the chief called on each of her majors by name to see if there was anyone on the command staff that they could not work with.\nMaj. Shannon Lauder responded that she could not work with Maj. Brian Kuriger because he has “sexually harassed me and attacked me, and I cannot work with him.”\nOne minute later into the meeting, the chief announced she was promoting Kuriger to lieutenant colonel.\n“I heard your concerns, and I understand that you cannot. And so, we’ll have to revisit on the status moving forward,” the chief said to Lauder.\nLauder apologized for having to bring up the allegations in the meeting, but said she did not want to be accused later of not mentioning them.\nLauder did not elaborate on her claims against Kuriger, who has been commander of internal investigations for the department.\nGreenberg did not specify how long Gwinn-Villaroel would be on leave, or if she would be returning to run the department.\nGwinn-Villaroel was appointed interim chief of LMPD in January 2023 and was named permanent chief in July 2023.\nThe Louisville Courier Journal previously reported that Gwinn-Villaroel lied when she was a member of the Atlanta Police Department, and was suspended for 20 days — but didn’t disclose that to Louisville officials before they hired her.\nWDRB in Louisville reported that Gwinn-Villaroel falsely testified that when when she arrived on the scene of a deadly accident she was not wearing a body camera. A photograph of her at the scene showed that she was wearing a camera.\n©2024 Lexington Herald-Leader. Visit at kentucky.com.

    "text": "Actualidad\nIniciativa presidencial revive el Registro Nacional de Usuarios de Telefonía Móvil\nSurya Palacios\nLa base de datos no incluye entregar datos biométricos, aunque sí contiene riesgos para la privacidad de los ciudadanos que usan la telefonía celular.\nLa iniciativa de ley que regulará las reformas constitucionales en materia de seguridad pública, que aún debe aprobar el Congreso, prevé poner en operación un Registro Nacional de Usuarios de Telefonía Móvil que estará a cargo de la Agencia de Transformación Digital y Telecomunicaciones, aunque en esta ocasión se asegura que la base de datos será respetuosa de los derechos humanos.\nA diferencia del fracasado Padrón Nacional de Usuarios de Telefonía Móvil (PANAUT), propuesto por el hoy expresidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, y declarado inconstitucional por la Suprema Corte en 2022, el registro que plantea la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum no incluye la entrega de los datos biométricos de los titulares de líneas de telefonía celular.\n“Los prestadores de servicios móviles de telecomunicaciones, por sí o por medio de las empresas comercializadoras, estarán obligados a realizar el registro de alta de los titulares y usuarios de las líneas telefónicas móviles que operan en su red, e inhabilitar las líneas que no estén asociadas a una persona”, detalla la iniciativa de Ley General del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública.\nEl documento, enviado por Sheinbaum a la Cámara de Diputados, precisa que los operadores de telefonía móvil “únicamente podrán activar las líneas telefónicas para operar en su red cuando estén previamente registradas”.\nEs decir, cada línea deberá corresponderse con una persona física o moral (empresa), cuyos datos de identificación deberán ser registrados por las empresas telefónicas en la Agencia de Transformación Digital y Telecomunicaciones.\nEsto tiene como objetivo “robustecer las investigaciones a cargo de las Instituciones de Seguridad Pública y, de ser necesario, obtener datos de prueba para las investigaciones que lleven a cabo”.\nCon esto se trata de combatir “algunos de los delitos que más lastiman a la población, como el secuestro o la extorsión”, dice la iniciativa.\nDiferencias positivas\nHasta aquí hay dos importantes diferencias con el PANAUT, una base de datos que nunca llegó a implementarse porque trasgredía los derechos a la privacidad, intimidad y protección de datos personales de los usuarios de telefonía celular.\nEl registro que propone la iniciativa de la presidenta no impone ninguna carga a los titulares de las líneas telefónicas, sino que serán las empresas que prestan estos servicios las encargadas de dar de alta a sus usuarios ante la Agencia de Transformación Digital y Telecomunicaciones.\nAl menos así lo establecen las fracciones III y IV del artículo 12 de la iniciativa de Ley General del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública, aunque habrá que esperar que los legisladores no modifiquen la propuesta.\nIgualmente, se deberá observar que el reglamento o los lineamientos de esta norma no alteren lo dispuesto en la ley.\nDerivado de esta primera distinción, serán las empresas de telefonía móvil las que deberán cancelar todas las líneas que mantienen en funcionamiento sin contar con un titular claramente identificado.\nEn ese tenor, la fracción I del numeral 12 de la propuesta de ley es muy clara: Las empresas comercializadoras estarán obligadas a “inhabilitar las líneas que no estén asociadas a una persona, con excepción de los servicios de seguridad y emergencia”.\nEsto último es adecuado pues son las compañías de telefonía celular las que, actualmente, mantienen en funcionamiento cientos -o quizás miles- de líneas que pueden adquirirse en el comercio informal y en tiendas de conveniencia, sin necesidad de que el usuario se identifique plenamente.\nRiesgos inminentes\nNo obstante, esta base de datos también plantea un aspecto preocupante, ya que se propone que las instituciones de Seguridad Pública “contarán con los accesos necesarios al registro referido (…) con la finalidad de realizar las consultas requeridas para el ejercicio de sus atribuciones”.\nEsta facultad que se le otorga a las Policías del país, a la Guardia Nacional, y seguramente al Ejército, pues este también lleva a cabo labores de seguridad pública, estará regulada por los lineamientos que emita el Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública.\nEn este punto la iniciativa de la presidenta debió señalar que el acceso al registro se hará de conformidad con el artículo 16 de la Constitución, el numeral 177 del Código Penal Federal (CPF), el artículo 303 del Código Nacional de Procedimientos Penales (CNPP), y los lineamientos que expida el Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública.\nEsta fundamentación es necesaria porque “las comunicaciones privadas son inviolables” y, de manera exclusiva, es la autoridad judicial federal, es decir, un juez de Control, el único que puede “autorizar la intervención de cualquier comunicación privada”, estipula el artículo 16 constitucional.\nAdemás, si se está investigando un delito, el Ministerio Público también está obligado a pedir a un juez que autorice la localización geográfica en tiempo real de una línea de celular, o la entrega de datos conservados por las empresas de telefonía móvil, de acuerdo con el numeral 303 del CNPP.\nSi no se observan estas disposiciones, la intervención de comunicaciones privadas sin mandato de una autoridad judicial es un delito que se castiga con penas de prisión de entre seis a doce años.\nMÁS NOTICIAS:\nSurya PalaciosPeriodista y abogada, especialista en análisis jurídico y de derechos humanos.
