    "title": "Indian IT Companies Will Hire Fewer People In The AI Era: Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas",
    "text": "Indian IT services companies currently employ millions of Indians, but they might not need as many people with the advent of AI.\nThis stark prediction comes from Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity AI. In a recent podcast with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Srinivas discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence on Indian IT giants like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. His assessment, while potentially unsettling for many, offers a glimpse into a future where AI plays a more significant role in software development and other IT services. He suggested a fundamental shift in the industry, questioning the very premise on which these outsourcing giants were built.\n“What about the Indian outsourcing giants,” Kamath asked , “like Infosys, TCS, Wipro. What happens to them (in the AI era)?”\nSrinivas replied: “Yeah, I think they’re just going to use AIs. They’re not going to hire as many people going forward.”\nBut Kamath pushed back on the prediction. “The use case for an American company outsourcing to an Indian company was, if one were to assume, cheaper cost of labor. And now, maybe an AI agent does what people did. Then what happens to these companies in that world?\nSrinivas said that their business could be impacted. “Certainly, less..they’ll have to charge less,” he said.\nBut Srinivas added that the relationships these companies had developed with their clients would mean that they wouldn’t be replaced entirely. “Some of this is actually based on relationships. So, as a company, I know that AI can do these things, but I would still trust (IT services companies like Infosys and TCS) to do it without any bugs or errors.”\nHowever, he believes this advantage is temporary. “Until AIs are at a point of reliability where you just have no arguments not to use them,” Srinivas argued, “I feel like humans will still trust other human businesses to do stuff for them. But they’ll just push them to, ‘Hey, now that there’s AI, why do you guys need three months to get it done? Get it done faster.'”\nSrinivas’s comments paint a challenging picture for the Indian IT industry. The traditional cost arbitrage advantage is rapidly eroding as AI becomes more capable and affordable that even the cheapest programmers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that the world’s best programmer will be an AI in 2025, and in India, Inmobi CEO Naveen Tewari has said that 80 percent of their coding will be automated, and engineers will lose jobs. It’s extremely likely that these job losses will spill over to the Indian IT space.\nBut this shift isn’t unique to the Indian IT sector. Globally, industries are grappling with the implications of AI. While some fear widespread job displacement, others see an opportunity for increased productivity and innovation. The future likely lies somewhere in between, with businesses needing to strategically integrate AI while also investing in human capital to navigate this evolving landscape. The Indian IT giants, with their vast resources and talent pools, have the potential to lead this transformation — but they’d need to act decisively and quickly if they want to succeed.",

    "text": "L'enseigne de bricolage Castorama prévoit un plan de départs volontaires qui pourra concerner jusqu'à 100 salariés de son siège, près de Lille, soit un sur sept, alors que son concurrent Leroy Merlin a aussi récemment réduit ses effectifs dans ses fonctions centrales. \"La rupture conventionnelle collective s'applique uniquement aux salariés volontaires du siège de l'enseigne. Aucun collaborateur des magasins n'est concerné\", a précisé Castorama dans un communiqué reçu vendredi. Ce dispositif s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un plan stratégique de Castorama lancé en mars, qui a pour objectif de redresser sa rentabilité et l'aider à rester compétitif \"dans un contexte concurrentiel en constante évolution\", a ajouté l'entreprise. Enseigne du groupe britannique Kingfisher, Castorama compte au total plus de 11.000 collaborateurs et 95 magasins en France. Après avoir connu un boom du bricolage durant la pandémie de Covid-19, le secteur déchante en France. Au troisième trimestre, les ventes de Castorama ont reculé de 4,9% sur un an, selon les derniers résultats de Kingfisher publiés lundi. Le groupe britannique, également propriétaire de Brico Dépôt (dont les ventes ont décliné de 3,3% sur la même période), a mis ces mauvais chiffres sur le compte de \"la faiblesse du moral des consommateurs et de conditions météorologiques défavorables\". Grand rival de Castorama, Leroy Merlin a aussi procédé à une rupture conventionnelle collective ces derniers mois dans son siège de Lezennes, dans la banlieue lilloise, entraînant le départ de 130 collaborateurs, a indiqué l'enseigne à l'AFP vendredi, confirmant des informations des Echos. Le chiffre d'affaires de Leroy Merlin \"enregistre un recul à l'image du marché\", a ajouté une porte-parole, sans détailler davantage. \"En cause essentiellement, la baisse des transactions immobilières et des naissances\", qui amoindrit les travaux effectués par les Français, a-t-elle expliqué. Comptant environ 30.000 collaborateurs et 144 magasins en France selon son site, Leroy Merlin appartient à la galaxie Mulliez, également propriétaire du distributeur Auchan, lequel a annoncé début novembre un plan social massif menaçant 2.389 emplois en France. publié le 29 novembre à 20h17, AFP",
