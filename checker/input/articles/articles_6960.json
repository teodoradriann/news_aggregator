    "text": "Do you consider yourself to be an optimist? We got to thinking about this recently when we received a message from a lifelong friend. He talked about all the blessings in his life, in fact, his words were overflowing about living life abundantly. All this in spite of the fact that his wife has dementia, and he has started taking drugs for a newly discovered cancer. How is it that some people are able to maintain a positive outlook, even in the midst of serious, negative things happening in their lives? Let’s explore what optimism is and why it’s such a powerful force in life.\nStudies show that optimists typically are happier, healthier, and more successful in life. While it's easy to be brought down by negativity in today's world, maintaining an optimistic outlook has been shown to provide tremendous benefits across all areas of life. As the Dalai Lama once said, \"Choose to be optimistic, it feels better.\" With some conscious effort to cultivate positive thinking, you can tap into the incredible power of optimism.",

    "text": "By Nandita Bose and Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House Correspondents' Association said on Thursday CNN has rejected multiple requests to include White House pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump. The press pool, made up of representatives of major news organizations including Reuters, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed. It is extremely rare for them to be barred from an event in the United States. \"WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,\" Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement. \"The pool is there for the 'what ifs?' in a world where the unexpected does happen,\" she said, and to provide \"context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production,\" she said. \"These reporters are there to see what is said and done when the microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation, she wrote, with duties \"separate from the production of the debate as a news event.\" O'Donnell said both the Biden and Trump campaigns agreed to the WHCA's request. CNN has only agreed to allow one White House print pool reporter to enter the studio during a commercial break to \"briefly observe the setting.\" The network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television feed of the debate to other networks. CNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network said in a statement it is a member of the WHCA and respects the role the group plays to further press freedom and access. But the debate was being held without an audience in a CNN studio and is closed to the press, CNN said. \"Precedent matters for future debates,\" O'Donnell said, alluding to Biden and Trump's face off again in September. The National Association of Black Journalists has also asked CNN to accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none of Atlanta's Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the debate.

    "text": "Why Chris Bosh’s Career Ended at 31: The Blood Clot Battle\nChris Bosh's NBA career ended prematurely due to recurring blood clots, not injury. Retiring at 31, he left behind a Hall of Fame legacy with 11 All-Star selections and an average of 19.1 points per game. Bosh's health challenges began in February 2015 when blood clots were discovered in his lungs, leading to significant playing time lost and eventually forcing his retirement. Despite a brief comeback attempt, Bosh officially retired in March 2019, shortly after the Miami Heat honored him by retiring his jersey.\n- Bosh played 893 career games and scored a total of 17,189 points, averaging 19.2 points per game.\n- He is a two-time NBA champion and an 11-time All-Star throughout his 13-season career.\nWhile Bosh had a successful career with significant accolades, the sudden nature of his health issues raised questions about long-term wellness for athletes and the impact of serious medical conditions on professional sports careers.\nState of Play- Bosh was sidelined after doctors discovered blood clots in his leg during the 2016 NBA All-Star break, preventing him from returning to play.\n- The NBA ruled his condition a career-ending illness in June 2017, leading to his release by the Miami Heat.\nDespite his retirement, Bosh’s legacy continues to be celebrated in the NBA, and discussions around player health and safety might gain more attention, especially regarding conditions like blood clots.\nBottom LineChris Bosh’s story underscores the risks athletes face with health issues beyond their control, highlighting the need for greater awareness and preventative measures in sports regarding medical conditions.\nRead more at @sportingnews\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "Here's how Nintendo Switch 2 GameShare lets you share multiplayer games with other Switches | TheSixthAxis",
    "text": "Nintendo is revitalising one of their favourite multiplayer game concepts for the Nintendo Switch 2 with GameShare, letting you share multiplayer games with other Switch owners, using just a single copy of a game.\nThis is different to PlayStation’s SharePlay, which streams a gameplay video to invited players, but is instead beaming game code to the other systems, letting them run the game on-device and with each player having a bespoke viewpoint, depending on the game.\nGameShare will work both over local wireless and over the internet via GameChat, but it will be more limited in that second scenario.\nLocally, a Nintendo Switch 2 can share a multiplayer game with both Switch 2 and original Switch consoles (depending on the game), but GameChat is a Switch 2 exclusive feature, so online GameShare only works with Switch 2 consoles. Additionally, some games will only have local GameShare enabled and block online play.\nSix Nintendo Switch games are getting upgrades to support GameShare on the Nintendo Switch 2, most of them free.\nEach of these is a very different style of game. 51 Worldwide Games is packed full of boardgames, so each player can have different views of a chess board, for example. Treasure Tracker and 3D World are both isometric platformers from the Wii U with fully separate character control, while Super Mario Odyssey’s multiplayer is restricted to the second player being Cappy.\nWe’ve seen this concept many times in the past, whether it was the limited cable linked multiplayer of GBA games, giving small portions of games to those without a cartridge, or the same idea wirelessly with later handhelds like the 3DS – I think Tri-Force Heroes had this feature? – and it will be interesting to see just how extensively this is featured in Nintendo Switch 2 games.\nSource: Nintendo",
