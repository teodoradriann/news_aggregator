    "text": "Amherst College rejects calls for divestment from corporations supplying military equipment to Israel |Published: 06-27-2024 4:46 PM| AMHERST — Trustees for Amherst College are rejecting appeals from faculty, students and alumni to divest from corporations that could be supplying military equipment to Israel in its ongoing war in Gaza. Citing “significant disagreements” over the divestment appeals and the possibility of compromising the college’s ongoing operations, Amherst College officials posted a letter online Monday titled “Decisions Concerning Formal Divestment Resolutions,” signed by President Michael A. Elliott; Andrew J. Nussbaum, who chairs the trustees; and Chantal E. Kordula, the chair-elect for the trustees, stating that they will not heed formal calls for divestment from the Faculty Senate and the Amherst Association of Amherst Students. “Guided by the fundamental principle of respecting the diversity of opinion in our community and noting the practical challenges, the board has decided unanimously not to pursue the divestment actions requested in the faculty and AAS resolutions,” the letter reads. “To be very clear, the board’s position is neither an endorsement of Israel’s campaign in Gaza nor a statement in support of violence rather than peace,” the letter continues. “It is, instead, a carefully considered response to the demand that the institution adopt a defined position on global events that are of intense interest to many at Amherst, events subject to ongoing debate and disagreement whose outcome will be shaped not by our investment decisions but by the decisions of governments across the world.” In May, the Amherst College Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine became the third faculty organization in the country to endorse divestment through a full vote, following the faculty senates at Pomona and the University of Michigan. Leaders of the group said the decision by the trustees is troubling. “We are profoundly disappointed by the lack of moral courage on display in the trustees’ decision to reject the call of faculty, students and alumni to divest Amherst College’s endowment from companies profiting from Israel’s ongoing siege of Gaza,” wrote Christopher T. Dole, a professor of anthropology. “Their statement justifying inaction in the face of deepening atrocities committed by Israel against Palestinians repeats the same justifications offered in a statement they released in December, rejecting our earlier call for divestment.” At that time, 60 faculty members signed a letter calling for divestment from companies that could be making money off the Israel-Hamas war. The faculty group later cited statistics in its appeal, noting that nearly 35,000 Palestinians — including 14,500 children — in Gaza were killed by the Israeli military as of May 1.

(Sixty-four percent) of the faculty supported the resolution,” Dole wrote. In addition, he pointed to the student senate passing a similar resolution by a vote of 23-1. “Despite the collective voice of faculty, students and alumni calling for divestment, the trustees have once again made the choice to do nothing,” Dole wrote. “We continue to feel strongly that profiting from the death of Palestinian civilians goes against the values of our institution and, therefore, our work will continue.” The decision was announced a few weeks after pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted events at the college’s reunion weekend. Amherst Alumni for Palestine, which took credit for those interruptions, issued a statement that it was both “unsurprised and undeterred” by the statement from trustees, who it said has been “swayed by a powerful minority of students, faculty, and alumni who support that genocide,” and that apparently not enough has yet been done to disrupt Amherst College’s operations so that divestment will happen. “We take the trustees’ statement as an invitation to renew our commitment to the hard work of building the power necessary to force Amherst College to end its complicity in genocide against Palestinians and in all other forms of racism and oppression,” the organization said. The letter from Elliott and the trustees referenced the requests and resolutions from those associated with the college, including meetings with trustees, as well as a letter alumni printed in the Amherst Student newspaper. “We recognize that the request for divestment reflects a deep concern for the human suffering, death, and destruction being endured by Palestinians in Gaza, and that those who support divestment perceive it as a clear moral statement about the actions of a foreign state, Israel. The trustees also appreciate that the faculty and student resolutions were considered through respectful, deliberative processes. At the same time, there are dissenting opinions, also strongly held, among a large number of students, faculty, staff and alumni.” But the letter cites both principles and practicalities entailed in the trustees’ requirement to act as a fiduciary — a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of the college for both the short and long term. It noted that the endowment directly supports 56% of the college’s annual operating budget. While those pushing for divestment have pointed to the college doing so as related to apartheid in South Africa and genocide in Sudan, the college said at those times there was clear agreement in the community and consensus of the federal government and international organizations. However, “with regard to divestment related to Israel’s campaign in Gaza, perspectives in the Amherst community are both deeply held and extremely polarized.” The letter also notes that the decision will disappoint and anger many in the college community, but that conversation will continue. “We expect that this particular dialogue will take the form of continued activism and protest, and the college will continue to protect that criticism, so long as it does not cross the line into harassment or hate and does not directly interfere with core instructional and administrative functions of the college. While our disagreements may be intense, resolute, and personally felt, we owe it to each other as fellow members of a community to listen and respond with respect.”Scott Merzbach can be reached at smerzbach@gazettenet.com.",

    "text": "PP y Vox boicotean el Orgullo LGTBI en instituciones en las que gobiernan Los carteles que anuncian el Orgullo en Madrid, colocados por el ayuntamiento de José Luis Martínez-Almeida, del PP, no hacen alusión al colectivo ni a sus reivindicaciones. En València y Toledo –dos capitales donde los populares gobiernan con Vox– agentes de policía retiraron este jueves por la fuerza banderas arcoíris colocadas por la izquierda. Y en Extremadura, un diputado de la extrema derecha, que también gobierna la región con el PP, equiparó esta semana la lucha por la igualdad y la diversidad con asociaciones de “bigotudos que fuman”. La celebración del Orgullo LGTBI de 2024 que se conmemora este viernes evidencia, un año más, los intentos de las derechas de PP y Vox de invisibilizar las reivindicaciones del colectivo y sus símbolos en multitud de instituciones en las que gobiernan. A la negativa a colgar la bandera arcoíris que representa la lucha de lesbianas, gays, transexuales, bisexuales y queer en balcones y ventanas de ayuntamientos o parlamentos autonómicos se suma el intento de los partidos de Alberto Núñez Feijóo y Santiago Abascal de reducir el Orgullo a una fiesta al margen de la lucha por la igualdad y la diversidad. En Madrid, uno de los grandes bastiones de las políticas de las derechas –pero que suele ser el centro de la reivindicación del colectivo en la manifestación estatal del próximo 6 de julio–, las personas LGTBI han visto reducidos sus derechos desde el último Orgullo. En diciembre, la mayoría absoluta del PP en la Asamblea de Madrid [eliminó de la ley trans](https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/ayuso-consuma-primer-retroceso-derechos-colectivo-trans-lgtbi-aprobarse-reformas-legales_1_10790352.html) regional –aprobada en 2016– el concepto de 'identidad de género'. Además, de vuelta a la patologización, el Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso volvió a obligar a que los menores trans pasen por un examen médico antes de poder optar a tratamientos para el reconocimiento de su género y se explicitó que la atención psicológica o las valoraciones psiquiátricas no serían muestra de discriminación. También en educación se eliminaron los contenidos relativos a las personas trans de los currículos. En la norma que hace ocho años salió adelante con consenso, incluso con los votos del PP, se especificaba que debía respetarse “la imagen física del alumnado trans” y de la “libre elección de su indumentaria”. Pero en su modificación unilateral, sin el respaldo del resto de partidos presentes en la Asamblea, el equipo de Ayuso añadió una condición que trata de ponerle fin: “Sin menoscabo del debido respeto al resto de alumnos y las normas del centro educativo”. La ley anterior recogía el derecho de las personas trans a acceder a “las instalaciones” de los centros educativos “de acuerdo con su identidad de género, incluyendo los aseos y los vestuarios”. Con la modificación del equipo de Ayuso, el texto quedó redactado de la siguiente manera: “Si realizan actividades diferenciadas por sexo, se garantizarán las necesidades del alumno transexual, sin menoscabo de los derechos y la intimidad de los demás alumnos, especialmente de las chicas”. En el caso de la ley ante la LGTBIfobia –aprobada también por consenso en 2016– se retocaron aspectos sanitarios, organismos como el Consejo LGTBI de la Comunidad o el régimen sancionador. Una de las partes centrales de la reforma fue el ámbito educativo, que concentró cinco de los 20 artículos derogados, entre ellos el que atajaba el acoso escolar. Se eliminó, en concreto, el plan contra el acoso a los alumnos LGTBI y la realidad del colectivo se retiró de los currículos en los centros educativos. Precisamente esta semana [el Gobierno recurrió ambas modificaciones](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/gobierno-recurre-constitucional-recortes-derechos-leyes-lgtbi-comunidad-madrid_1_11476247.html) de las leyes LGTBI de la Comunidad de Madrid ante el Tribunal Constitucional, por lo que las dos reformas quedarán sin efecto hasta que los magistrados decidan sobre su constitucionalidad. La ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, consideró que “las disposiciones de la Comunidad de Madrid son una limitación de derechos en el reconocimiento trans y LGBTI”. Tacones y condones en los carteles de Madrid También ha sido polémica en los últimos días la actitud del Ayuntamiento de Madrid por los [carteles y banderolas](https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/tacones-condones-copas-criticas-carteles-orgullo-madrid-falta-reivindicacion-estereotipos-rancios_1_11471585.html) con los que anuncia los actos del Orgullo de la capital, que se prolongarán hasta el domingo, 7 de julio. El equipo de José Luis Martínez-Almeida ha decidido dejar fuera siglas del colectivo LGTBI, sus reivindicaciones y hasta la bandera multicolor. En su lugar, en los carteles han colocado un ilustración que simula una fiesta de confeti con fondo azul y salpicado de dibujos de tacones rojos, flores, copas de cocktail y preservativos. “Almeida reduce el Orgullo LGTBI a sexo, tacones y alcohol. Una descripción burda y burlona de una reivindicación histórica por el derecho a existir. La vergüenza que provoca el Ayuntamiento de Madrid se multiplica cada año”, criticó la portavoz de Más Madrid en la Asamblea, Manuela Bergerot. “El Orgullo no es una simple fiesta de confetis, tacones y preservativos. Es la reivindicación pacífica y respetuosa de los derechos de las personas LGTBI”, añadió la ministra de Igualdad, que consideró que los carteles son “un nuevo intento del PP de invisibilizar y denostar al movimiento”. El alcalde [se defendió de las críticas](https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/politica/almeida-defiende-carteles-orgullo-borran-luchas-lgtbiq-no-pasa-poner-copa-tacones_1_11473179.html): “Las fiestas del Orgullo se tienen que celebrar y no pasa nada por poner en un diseño una copa o unos tacones, por la tradicional carrera”. Él dijo el martes que la campaña había sido “acordada con los comerciantes de Chueca”. Minutos después, en cambio, AEGAL (Asociación de Empresas y Profesionales para Gays, Lesbianas, Bisexuales, Transexuales de Madrid y su Comunidad), que conforma la entidad organizadora del Orgullo de Madrid (MADO) junto a Cogam y Felgtbi+, lamentó en un comunicado que no había sido consultada “en ningún momento sobre dicho cartel ni campaña”. La organización empresarial [tildó de “inaceptable”](https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/somos/chueca/organizacion-madrid-orgullo-afea-ayuntamiento-utilice-estereotipos-estigmatizan-carteles_1_11478270.html) que “el colectivo LGTBI sea reducido a estereotipos que estigmatizan, desviando así la atención de la reivindicación y lucha por los derechos de todas, todos y todes, que son el verdadero espíritu del Orgullo”. En Madrid dejó de colocarse la bandera arcoíris en el balcón principal del ayuntamiento cuando la derecha recuperó el poder, en 2019. Y este año se han sumado al boicot instituciones municipales y autonómicas de todo el país gobernadas por PP y Vox. En València, la alcaldesa, María José Catalá –del PP, pero que gobierna con Vox–, [justificó el miércoles](https://www.eldiario.es/comunitat-valenciana/valencia/alcaldesa-valencia-justifica-no-colgar-bandera-lgtbi-dia-ela-alzheimer_1_11480767.html) no colgar la bandera LGTBI en el ayuntamiento porque tampoco se hace “en el día del ELA o del Alzheimer”. Sus palabras causaron un enorme revuelo tanto entre las fuerzas de la oposición como en organizaciones que defienden los derechos del colectivo, al considerar que estaba equiparando la homosexualidad con enfermedades. “Hago comparación de días internacionales, no hago ningún tipo de comparación que vaya más allá de días internacionales, sean los que sean. Quien haya pensado que estaba comparando ser una persona LGTBI con una enfermedad se equivoca. Estoy hablando de cómo el Ayuntamiento de València celebra días internacionales, sean los que sean, y qué pancartas se ponen, que ya no se pone ninguna. Eso sí, la pancarta más grande la pone esta noche e Ayuntamiento de València porque se va a iluminar toda su fachada con la bandera LGTBI, por lo tanto, comprometidos con la diversidad”, se defendió después la propia Catalá, que fue apoyada explícitamente por su compañero de partido, el presidente de la Comunitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón. Este jueves, la Policía Local [arrebató una bandera LGTBIQ+](https://www.eldiario.es/comunitat-valenciana/policia-local-arrebata-bandera-lgtbiq-ediles-compromis-intentaban-colgarla-balcon-ayuntamiento-valencia_1_11482741.html) a los ediles de Compromís cuando intentaban colgarla del balcón del consistorio. “Si Catalá no penja la bandera, fes-ho tu (Si Catalá no cuelga la bandera, hazlo tu)”, dijo Papi Robles, portavoz de Compromís en el ayuntamiento, en un vídeo en el que se aprecia cómo un agente arranca el emblema a los ediles de la oposición. La bandera sí colgará este viernes en la fachada de Les Corts después de que PP, PSPV y Compromís rechazaran una propuesta de Vox para no exhibirla y que defendió la presidenta de la cámara, Llanos Massó, de la extrema derecha. Sin banderas arcoíris en Huesca, Cartagena o Toledo En las capitales de Castilla-La Mancha solo los ayuntamientos de Cuenca y Albacete –en esta última ciudad el PP gobierna en solitario, aunque en minoría– lucirán este año la bandera LGTBI. Son también los únicos consistorios capitalinos en los que no gobiernan PP y Vox. En los municipios de Toledo, Guadalajara, Talavera de la Reina y Ciudad Real no habrá despliegue del símbolo arcoíris en las fachadas consistoriales, con diferentes explicaciones por parte de los gobiernos de las derechas. Y en Guadalajara se ha aludido a mantener el ayuntamiento como un “espacio de neutralidad”, solo con banderas oficiales. En Toledo, como respuesta a la negativa del Gobierno municipal de colgar, un año más, la bandera en el balcón consistorial, el PSOE local y regional, CCOO, UGT y la delegación de Gobierno de España reaccionaron colocando el símbolo en sus respectivos edificios. Durante el pleno del jueves el alcalde, del PP, [ordenó a la Policía retirar](https://www.eldiario.es/castilla-la-mancha/politica/psoe-coloca-bandera-lgtbi-durante-pleno-ayuntamiento-toledo-alcalde-suspende_1_11482621.html) el emblema LGTBI colocado en el pleno por concejales del PSOE. En Ciudad Real el ayuntamiento tampoco ha colocado la bandera arcoíris. Y en Talavera de la Reina también gobiernan PP y Vox y tampoco habrá bandera. En Aragón la principal novedad este Orgullo será que la bandera arcoíris [no colgará de la sede](https://www.eldiario.es/aragon/protesta-arcoiris-veto-ayuntamiento-huesca-simbolos-orgullo_1_11474467.html) del Ayuntamiento de Huesca, donde gobiernan PP y Vox. En la Región de Murcia, el conflicto también fue local y tuvo lugar entre los meses de marzo y abril. En Cartagena, con motivo del Día Internacional de la Visibilidad Trans y a petición del Galactyco, el PP instaló tres banderas LGTBI. Pero Vox lanzó un comunicado pidiendo explicaciones, argumentando que estas banderas “procuran la división artificial entre los cartageneros”. A pesar de que las insignias solo estaban previstas para permanecer izadas una jornada, Vox reivindicó su retirada en [redes sociales](https://twitter.com/vox_cartagena/status/1775416487148155082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1775416487148155082%7Ctwgr%5Eb2da8f75b8c406fd5f442b8750ce6967e21d50c8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laopiniondemurcia.es%2Fcartagena%2F2024%2F04%2F03%2Fcartagena-retira-banderas-colectivo-lgtbiq-100568251.html). “La única bandera que nos representa a todos, sin distinción de orientación sexual, es nuestra enseña”, dijo la extrema derecha, refiriéndose a la bandera de España. En Asturias, el Ayuntamiento de Gijón no ha lucido este año ni bandera ni pancarta arcoíris, que será sustituida por la iluminación de la fachada del consistorio ya que “el colectivo no solicitó la colocación de bandera o pancarta alguna” en la reunión mantenida con el gobierno a finales del mes de abril, según fuentes municipales. La asociación de “bigotudos que fuman” Y en Castilla y León las ciudades de Burgos y Valladolid –ambas en manos de las derechas– tampoco han colocado nada en los balcones de la casa consistorial, mientras que el resto pasarán por la colocación de una pancarta, como en León, o la propia bandera arcoíris, como en Palencia. En las Cortes autonómicas, por tercer año consecutivo tras la llegada de Vox a la Presidencia de la cámara, será el PSOE el que cuelgue en el exterior de sus despachos una pancarta multicolor, como también han hecho en la casa consistorial de Valladolid. Esta misma semana se evidenciaron las diferencias entre PP y Vox sobre el colectivo LGTBI en Extremadura, que gobiernan en coalición. El equipo de la presidenta, la popular María Guardiola, logró aprobar en el pleno de la Asamblea la puesta en marcha del número 028 de ayuda a las personas LGTBI, pero [Vox se burló de la propuestas](https://www.eldiario.es/extremadura/politica/vox-burla-linea-gratuita-lgtbifobia-asociacion-bigotudos-fuman-quiere-telefono_1_11478907.html) en los siguientes términos.“ Pertenezco a la asociación de familias numerosas y, a lo mejor, también queremos un número o la asociación de bigotudos que fuman quieren otro”, dijo el diputado de extrema derecha, Javier Bravo. En la Región de Murcia el conflicto fue local y tuvo lugar entre los meses de marzo y abril. En la ciudad de Cartagena, con motivo del Día Internacional de la Visibilidad Trans, el 31 de marzo, el PP instaló tres banderas pertenecientes al colectivo LGTBI. Vox lanzó un comunicado pidiendo explicaciones, argumentando que estas banderas “procuran la división artificial entre los cartageneros”. A pesar de que las insignias solo estaban previstas para permanecer izadas una jornada, Vox reivindicó su retirada en [redes sociales](https://twitter.com/vox_cartagena/status/1775416487148155082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1775416487148155082%7Ctwgr%5Eb2da8f75b8c406fd5f442b8750ce6967e21d50c8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laopiniondemurcia.es%2Fcartagena%2F2024%2F04%2F03%2Fcartagena-retira-banderas-colectivo-lgtbiq-100568251.html) y lo consiguió. “La única bandera que nos representa a todos, sin distinción de orientación sexual, es nuestra enseña”, dijo, refiriéndose a la bandera de España. *Con información de Carlos Navarro, Francisca Bravo Miranda, Elisa M.

    "text": "Graduating students at a university in Zhengzhou, Henan province, set up stalls on campus to sell their various secondhand items last month. CHINA DAILY From pre-loved clothing and handbags to furniture and books, the trade in secondhand merchandise is growing rapidly in China — delivering not only bargains, but also green benefits.\nThe trend represents a change in Chinese people's mindset, as more consumers are recognizing the value of extending the life span of products through reuse and recycling. By embracing the secondhand market, they are not only finding cost-effective alternatives but also contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly way of life through the recycling of goods.\nKang Lin, in her 40s, is originally from Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and now calls Hong Kong home. A seasoned traveler, she lived in Oxford, the United Kingdom, for a year and a half, Shanghai for a year, and Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, for 12 months.\nFor Kang, buying secondhand goods is more than just a cost-saving measure — it's a lifestyle choice that celebrates sustainability and uncovers hidden treasures from the past.\n\"When I lived overseas, buying secondhand was the most cost-effective option since these items were inexpensive, and I didn't mind discarding them when I left,\" she said. \"It's also environmentally friendly, as it prevents usable items from going to waste — my unwanted items may be desired by others, and vice versa.\"\nPhotography enthusiasts select camera equipment and accessories at a used camera exchange event in Beijing on April 21. SONG JIARU/FOR CHINA DAILY In Oxford, Kang immersed herself in exploring the city's many charity shops. She even volunteered at Oxfam, the nonprofit organization combating global hunger, which operates over 500 stores in the UK, generating nearly 50 million pounds ($63 million) annually from the sale of donated secondhand goods like clothing, housewares, furniture, and more.\nBut affordability isn't the sole reason Kang is drawn to secondhand shopping. She values \"the opportunity to uncover treasures — especially antique items that offer a glimpse into past production techniques.\"\nKang has discovered \"gems\" from the 1920s to 1950s with no signs of wear, such as a 1925 thermos flask and 1950s woolen military long johns.\n\"There were also high-quality brass tools from decades ago and pop-art pioneers … It felt like I'd stepped into a museum,\" she said, adding the objects served as a means to travel back in time.\n\"The years haven't dimmed their brilliance; instead, they made them shine ever brighter,\" she said.\nPhotography enthusiasts select camera equipment and accessories at a used camera exchange event in Beijing on April 21.

WANG GANG/FOR CHINA DAILY Refresh, repeat\nThe Deja Vu Recycle Store launched its app in 2017. In 2020, it started its secondhand clothing business and simultaneously opened a store on Anfu Road in Shanghai. In 2024, a new store opened in Hongqiao Tiandi in Shanghai. It has also developed its apparel and electronics resale business.\nAs of July 2024, Deja Vu recycles nearly 600,000 books and approximately 300,000 clothing items on a yearly basis. Currently, it has over 8,000 brands. Their products are sold with guarantees about their authenticity, and Deja Vu promises customers compensation equivalent to three times the purchase price if the goods are found to be counterfeit. Pirated apparel is rejected or destroyed when detected, the company said.\nYe Lu, a staff member of Deja Vu's marketing department, said the company is building a community of secondhand goods enthusiasts through numerous social media platforms.\n\"Previously, we used WeChat and Weibo, but recently we've tried new lifestyle platforms like Xiaohongshu, product reviews, and articles, to better connect with users and make them more comfortable with secondhand goods,\" Ye said.\nIn 2020, when Deja Vu was researching the feasibility of expanding into the secondhand clothing business, over 90 percent of survey respondents said they would not wear pre-worn clothes. Now, nearly half of their new customers get to know secondhand clothing through Deja Vu, and become repeat buyers.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Deja Vu established an authentication process for secondhand clothing, built a fully automated secondhand clothing sorting facility, opened a popular secondhand store on Anfu Road in Shanghai, and launched clothing sales on their app.\nIn mid-May, Deja Vu opened a store at Hongqiao Tian Di, with an area of 1,500 square meters, selling nearly 6,000 secondhand clothing items.\n\"We have been witnesses to the gradual development of the secondhand market in China over the years, and it fills us with confidence about the future,\" Ye said.\nConsumers select products at an outlet of Deja Vu Recycle Store in Beijing, in June 2023. CHINA DAILY Trading for profit\nThe transaction volume of China's used goods market surpassed 1 trillion yuan ($139.9 billion) in 2020, and is expected to reach 3 trillion yuan in 2025, according to a report issued by the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy of Tsinghua University.\nData from Xianyu, one of China's largest platforms for trading secondhand products, shows that the daily transaction volume on the platform has exceeded 1 billion yuan. Over the past year, about 4 million secondhand items were listed on Xianyu on a daily basis.\nForty-three percent of users are from the post-1995 generation, and 22 percent are from the post-2000 generation, the data showed. In 2023, the average post-1995 user on Xianyu earned 2,700 yuan, with young people discovering the \"wealth secret\" in trading secondhand goods.\nThe generational change is also reflected in a stronger awareness of how consumption impacts the environment.\nThe understanding of green consumption among those born in the 1990s and 2000s is significantly higher than other age groups in China, reaching 70 percent and 79 percent respectively, according to the Green Development Report on E-commerce in China released in 2023.\nWen Tianyi, a 21-year-old advertising major at a university in Beijing, spends around 1,000 to 2,000 yuan on secondhand goods every year and gets rid of around 10 items annually.\n\"During the first two years of university, I had little concept of spending money, so I ended up buying many useless items here and there,\" she said.\n\"I started paying attention to and getting rid of idle items during my freshman year, driven by the thought of wanting to get some cash back.\"\nThe first unused item Wen sold on Xianyu was a bottle of perfume she bought online.\nHer initial reason for purchasing secondhand items was simply to save money. Many of the items were relatively new, having been used only a few times. However, because they were secondhand the prices were greatly discounted.\n\"Key differences between buying new items and secondhand ones are lower costs but higher after-sales risks (no returns, counterfeit goods, questionable conditions), and relying on mutual trust between strangers rather than a service provider-client relationship,\" Wen said.\nShe said buying and selling secondhand merchandise had reshaped her ideas on consumption. \"Previously, items might have just been left unused, but now they can be revitalized with the incentive of earning some money, thereby supporting sustainable consumption,\" Wen said.\nShe has even adopted a \"secondhand mentality\" for making new purchases and considers how much an item will depreciate before being resold. This hit home when she sold 10 kilograms of clothing she had paid nearly 10,000 yuan for, to a clothing recycler for just 6 yuan.\nA blogger on Xiaohongshu, she advocates a minimalist approach to life and is more focused on saving money and getting rid of her unused goods.\n\"After dealing with idle items and engaging in secondhand consumption, I have embraced the concept of minimalist living. Moving from constantly buying to decluttering and letting go, I may have found a lifestyle that truly suits me,\" she said.\nConsumers select products at an outlet of Deja Vu Recycle Store in Beijing, in June 2023. CHINA DAILY Sweet charity\nThe recycling of household items, goods, clothing, and donations of food, have for a long time played a crucial role in keeping charities afloat.\nJiang Shujie is the chief executive officer of Buy42, a charitable organization founded in 2010, which operates 14 charity stores in Shanghai and sells donated goods at 30 to 70 percent below market prices.\nShe believes the secondhand goods market is an indication of a healthy developed economy.\n\"The popularity of secondhand purchases is also linked to economic development — as basic needs are met and material accumulation increases in developed countries, a prosperous secondhand market emerges from the surplus goods,\" she said.\nAfter running the charity for the past seven years, Jiang said she had seen customers go from doubting the safety and hygiene of previously owned items to viewing purchasing secondhand goods as a \"cool trend\".\nThis is driven by Generation Z's pursuit of high-end goods originally priced out of their reach, which they can now afford as secondhand purchases. It also aligns with their pursuit of unique, sustainable goods at affordable prices.\nThe prevalence of green consumption among Chinese people has helped propel the secondhand goods sector into a period of rapid development. However, due to the nature of secondhand transactions, trust issues — such as the authenticity of goods — remain core factors in determining how far the industry can go.\n\"Secondhand trading platforms play a crucial role in establishing trust — acting as a bond between buyers and strangers,\" Jiang said. \"A high level of trust is required for consumers to accept purchasing and using secondhand goods with potential flaws from unknown previous owners. The value of these platforms lies in facilitating trust for the secondhand market to operate.\"\nHowever, from a positive perspective, Jiang said such platforms satisfy diverse needs — from trading secondhand luxury items to connecting communities with shared interests.\nShe believes that platforms like Buy42 provide \"low-barrier\" public welfare opportunities by recycling secondhand and unused items.\nShoppers in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, browse at Deja Vu's pop-up bookstore in May. The event between April and May attracted over 80,000 visitors. CHINA DAILY Green vision\nAs the world's second-largest consumer market and the largest online retail market, China has introduced various policies in recent years to encourage and support green consumption and promote the recycling of unused items.\n\"In recent years, our country has been advocating the concept of sustainable living and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles. Whether from the corporate level, the government level, or the public welfare sector, there has been increasing promotion of more environmentally friendly consumption attitudes, which are becoming deeply rooted in people's mindset,\" Jiang said.\nIn July 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued the 14th Five-Year Plan for Circular Economy Development, explicitly encouraging the development of the \"internet plus secondhand\" model, strengthening the management responsibilities of internet trading platforms, and enhancing the oversight of such trading to provide standardized and regulated services for secondhand goods transactions.\n\"Establishing a sound recycling system for waste materials is of great significance for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality, and the trading of idle goods is also an important measure to help achieve these 'dual carbon' goals,\" said Du Huanzheng, director of the Institute of Ecological Civilization and Circular Economy at Tongji University in Shanghai.\nIn 2022, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce, along with other departments, issued the Implementation Plan for Promoting Green Consumption. The plan proposed the expansion of channels for the sharing and utilization of idle resources and secondhand transactions.\n\"People's mindset toward using secondhand products is gradually shifting, and the volume of secondhand transactions is increasing, corresponding to supply and demand,\" Du said.\n\"With more standardized trading platforms emerging in China, this signals that the secondhand market will definitely be a future lifestyle trend.\"\nContact the writer at sunnyu923@163.com\nPhotography enthusiasts select camera equipment and accessories at a used camera exchange event in Beijing on April 21.

    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, May 24, 2024 / 10:31 am Father Julio Fernández Techera, a Jesuit priest and rector of the Catholic University of Uruguay, has written a widely circulated, critical essay about the Society of Jesus warning that the order, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, is in “deep decline.” The essay by the 57-year-old priest is titled “Ad Usum Nostrorum III” (“For Our Use III”) addressed to his Jesuit brothers. The document, which originally circulated within the Society of Jesus, was recently published by the Spanish journalist Francisco José Fernández de la Cigoña on his blog on [Infovaticana](https://infovaticana.com/blogs/cigona/un-documento-extraordinario-de-un-jesuita-que-tambien-lo-parece/). This is the third document in a series that Fernández began in 2022 when he wrote his initial essay (“Ad Usum Nostrorum”), noting that for a long time he has felt dissatisfied with the situation in the Society of Jesus while making it clear that he is not going through a vocational crisis nor is he thinking about leaving. He published the second essay a year later, in April 2023. In that text he expressed his appreciation for the many responses he received, also from young Jesuits, and even from some who didn’t agree with him but thanked him for the opportunity to debate and propose a revision of the order.",
