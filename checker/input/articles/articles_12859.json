    "text": "Jacinta Davila's murder charge droppedCharged with lesser offence of assisting an offenderREAD MORE: Inside the life of mum and dad accused of home invasion death\nA young Adelaide mum who was behind bars over the death of a renowned doctor has been immediately released on bail.\nJacinta Davila, 27 will spend Christmas at home with her eight-month-old son under home detention after her murder charge over the death of Dr Michael Yung death was dropped by prosecutors on Friday.\nProsecutors downgraded her charge to assisting an offender, an offence that still carries a significant legal punishment.\nDavila and her partner Kerem Aydin, 22, were initially both charged with murdering Dr Yung in a violent home invasion at Gilberton in Adelaide’s inner-north earlier in this month.\nMagistrate Michael Jandy had previously heard Davila’s DNA was found on a headtorch at the suspected entry point, adjacent to a fly screen that had been sliced open, while Aydin was linked to blood stains at the scene.\nJacinta Davila (right) will be at home for her baby son’s first Christmas after her murder charge was dropped by prosecutors\nDr Michael Yung (picture) was killed in a violent home invasion in Adelaide’s inner-north\nMs Davila walked free from Adelaide’s Women’s Prison on Friday after her murder charge over the death of Dr Michael Yung death was dropped by prosecutors\nWhile there was a relatively strong case that Davila had tampered with evidence by attempting to wash blood from clothing found at the couple’s Thebarton home, Mr Jandy said there was an obvious question mark surrounding the strength of evidence attaching her to the crime scene.\nAlthough Davila’s DNA was found at the Gilberton house, it could have transferred from her to the crime scene via Aydin, he said.\n‘Absent of any other evidence putting this defendant at the scene of the crime at the time, the case will remain possibly equivocal in relation to her,’ Mr Jandy told Adelaide Magistrates Court on December 13.\nMr Jandy allowed Davila to be released from Adelaide Women’s Prison on Friday after prosecutors said they would not oppose bail.\nDavila was released from Adelaide Women’s Prison on Friday after prosecutors said they would not oppose bail\nMs Davila’s lawyer Alexander Jackson (pictured on Friday ) told the court that keeping his client in custody throughout a lengthy trial would bring undue hardship on her baby boy\nJamila Davila (right) will be fitted with an electric monitoring device, surrender her passport and have no contact with her partner Kerem Aydin (left) as part of her strict bail conditions\nDavila will remain on home detention at a house in Mile End, where she will be able to look after her eight-month-old son.\nDavila sobbed and exhaled heavily with relief after being granted bail.\n‘Thank you so much,’ she told the judge via videolink.\nHer lawyer, Alexander Jackson, had earlier told the court that her client was effectively the baby’s sole carer and that remaining in custody throughout a lengthy trial would bring undue hardship on him.\nThe couple had unsuccessfully attempted co-parenting after the child was conceived during a one-night stand, he told the court.\nAs part of her bail conditions, Davila must be fitted with an electric monitoring device, relinquish her passport, avoid all contact with Aydin and only leave the house with the express approval of a corrections supervisor.\nJacinta Davila (left) wept after finding out she would immediately be released from custody. Her partner Kerem Aydin (right) remains behind bars charged with murder\nAydin remains charged with Dr Yung’s murder and trespassing with the intention to steal more than $30,000 worth of property.\nThe pair will return to court in March.\nDetectives were no longer seeking any other suspects for the alleged crime.\n“There has been no connection identified between the arrested people and those being sought for a recent crime spree across Adelaide,” police said.",

    "text": "Propel Software, creator of a product value management (PVM) platform, makes available its Summer 2025 release.

    "text": "A Port Macquarie newsagent says he has sold out of Australia Day merchandise “three times over” ahead of the controversial national holiday.\nBlairs Newsagency owner Peter Thompsett joined Nat Barr and Matt Shirvington at Brekky Central on Friday, and told them business had been booming ahead of Australia Day on January 26.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Blairs Newsagency owner Peter Thompsett reveals he is doing a roaring trade with Australia Day products.\nStream the world's best reality, entertainment and true crime shows for free on 7Bravo on\n7plus >>\nPeter said he had “sold out,” of Australia Day products, with no slowdown in sales, despite Woolworths claiming “gradual decline in demand” for the reason behind the decision to scrap the merchandise.\n“We’ve restocked probably three times over and we’ve sold everything — we’ve had to put our Port Macquarie souvenirs out to fill the spot,” Peter said.\n“I think when people think they might lose Australia Day, they really ramp it up.”\nPeter blamed “minority corporates”, for their decision to scrap the products, especially after Woolworths and Aldi decided to dump Australia Day products this year.\n“It’s the minority corporate level who are doing this — don’t blame the people on the floor at Woolies (Woolworths).\n“I’d love to show you our stock but we have nothing (left),” he added.\nPeter said he was pleased the Port Macquarie community was celebrating.\n“We’re happy that everyone is getting a flag and getting into and celebrating what makes this nation great.\n“We’re a great melting pot — from Indigenous (cultures) to all of our cultures — it’s a fantastic country.”\nThe small business owner said Australia Day was a day for everyone to celebrate: “I think myself, it’s a mixture of our cultures coming together and I think we need to move forward now and celebrate (a national day) together.”\nOn Wednesday, Woolworths boss Brad Banducci was grilled by Nat Barr on Sunrise over the decision to scrap Australia Day products.\nBanducci denied the dumping was “political” when questioned by Nat\n“I don’t think that is true Natalie (that it was political). We are focusing on what we do best, which is food and everyday needs,” he said.\nIn the hard-hitting interview, Nat questioned how the supermarket giant knew of the declining sales, with Banducci responding that Australia Day merchandise had slowed over a few years.\n“It’s been reducing for a number of years, Natalie. So it has been going on over time — that space in our stores (for variety products) has been shrinking anyway,” he said.\n“So, we’ve got out of a whole series of categories in general merchandise and expanding our food and groceries, basically from the feedback from our customers.”\nWoolworths confirmed this month that it would no longer sell any Australia Day merchandise in stores earlier this month, in a now much-maligned decision.\nIn a statement to\n7NEWS.com.au, a spokesperson said Woolworths and BIG W would not be stocking items specific to Australia Day in 2024.\nStream Free on",

    "text": "Heavy downpours battered the UK on Thursday evening as almost a month&#039;s worth of rain fell in an hour in some places. A yellow warning for thunderstorms was issued by the Met Office that covered the majority of the UK on Thursday as temperatures soared to highs of 30C. Commuters were left trapped on flooded roads, public transport was delayed and power cuts hit large parts of the country because of the heavy downpours - which were accompanied by &#039;gusty winds, frequent lightning and large hail&#039;. By 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data. Average total rainfall for the month of August in the same area is 56mm, the forecaster said. But Brits can look forward to Friday being &#039;mostly dry&#039; and &#039;muggy&#039;, with highs of up to 29C in the south-east England. Drivers faced road closures due to flooded roads across the UK as almost a month&#039;s worth of rain fell in an hour in some places Commuters were left trapped on flooded roads, public transport was delayed and power cuts hit large parts of the country because of the heavy downpours In Guildford, Surrey, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water By 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data Following Thursday evening&#039;s heavy rain, 26 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, had been issued by the Environment Agency - 11 of which were in Greater London. One flood warning, meaning flooding is expected, was issued for Kidbrooke Stream at Forest Row in East Sussex. In Guildford, Surrey, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water. Benson Lock in Oxfordshire recorded 30mm of rainfall in an hour while Wisley, Surrey, enjoyed the highest temperature of the day of 30.2C. It comes after the country was beset by scorching weather - with the mercury soaring to highs of over 31C yesterday in Brize Norton, Oxfordshire. A &#039;danger to life&#039; warning is currently in force across much of England and Wales from the Met Office [video_shortcode_video_html_5 src=&quot;https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/01/4949007418907969547/1024x576_MP4_4949007418907969547.mp4&quot;] A person enjoys the weather in Regent&#039;s Park, London, on the hottest day of the year so far People enjoy the warm weather at Clevedon Marine Lake in Clevedon Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said: &#039;There&#039;s been very humid air which is why it&#039;s felt so close and muggy as well. &#039;The same air has been over northern France for the last day or two as well - so those heavy thundery showers that they had during the triathlon yesterday morning. &#039;So basically, we&#039;ve been getting the same sort of weather as the Olympics have.&#039; &#039;It will be another very warm, very muggy feeling day and that&#039;s what helps keep a few of those showers going - but it&#039;s not until Saturday where things will feel much fresher across the board.&#039; The Met Office has also confirmed that Britain is currently experiencing an official heatwave and that it is likely to remain very warm for the next few days. Tuesday was the UK&#039;s warmest day of 2024 so far with a temperature of 32.0C (89.6F) recorded in London at both Kew Gardens and Heathrow Airport. But the heat is not set to last into the weekend with temperatures set to return to the mid-20Cs in the South as a band of rain moves through the country on Saturday.",
