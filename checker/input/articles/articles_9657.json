    "text": "Ukrainian hackers target former Russian commander’s computer, reveal key findings Hacktivists from Cyber Resistance and KibOrg successfully deployed a spyware virus onto the personal computer of Colonel General Alexander Romanchuk, the former commander of Russian forces on the Zaporizhzhia front The National Resistance Center of Ukraine [reported](https://sprotyv.mod.gov.ua/ukrayinskym-haktyvistam-vdalosya-zlamaty-komp-yuter-komanduvacha-sylamy-rf-na-zaporizkomu-napryami/) the information. The virus spread to several devices in the main headquarters of the Russian group. The surveillance operation lasted over a year and a half, allowing access to information about Russia’s plans, troop locations, and reconnaissance resources. Some of the gathered material was passed on to analysts at the National Resistance Center. With the active phase of the operation now complete, certain details have been made public. \"Hero of the Special Military Operation\" indifferent to the frontline If you were to piece together the portrait of Romanchuk from publications by certain Russian \"war correspondents\" on Telegram, he would appear as a true Rambo, with the intellect of Clausewitz or Sun Tzu, who almost single-handedly halted the Ukrainian advance on the Zaporizhzhia front in 2023. Romanchuk is being awarded the rank of Colonel General by the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Gerasimov, in the presence of the then-commander of the Russian invasion forces in Ukraine, Surovikin, just before his deployment to the Zaporizhzhia region in February 2023. The photo is from Romanchuk's personal archive. The Rybar channel publication states that Romanchuk, during his deployment to Syria, captured a tank, \"organized a fire carousel,\" and \"rescued 40 soldiers from the encirclement.\" Screenshot translation: The Russian Defense Ministry has revealed the commander of the Zaporizhzhia direction - Colonel General Alexander Vladimirovich Romanchuk. Project manager @rybar Mikhail Zvinchuk was his personal military interpreter in 2015-2016 in Syria, when General Romanchuk served as chief of staff of the entire grouping. Together they came out of the encirclement near Khanasir on February 23, 2016 (General Romanchuk then with two security men captured an ISIL tank and then arranged a fire carousel). His personal merit then was saving the lives of 40 officers and contractors from the “cauldron”. Another popular channel, Children of Arbat (Deti Arbata), includes Romanchuk in the list of the ten most talented Russian military commanders, while the channel Neighbor states that Romanchuk was a key figure in the Russian defense in Zaporizhzhia in 2023. Screenshot translation: Rating of military leaders. Analysis by the Children of Arbat. 10th place Colonel-General Romanchuk Our rating begins with Alexander Romanchuk, head of the All-Russian Military Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and a well-known figure to a wide audience. In the summer of 2023, during the tense situation on the Zaporizhzhia front: as the Ukrainian Armed Forces prepared for a large-scale offensive, the commander of the group was assigned the task of determining the direction of the main blow by the enemy, which he successfully managed. With such a reputation, Romanchuk was granted the honor of leading the May 9, 2024, Victory Day parade in Moscow. In reality, under Romanchuk's command on the Zaporizhzhia front, Russian forces traditionally flooded the frontline with \"cannon fodder.\" This became clear in detail through the [publication](https://sprotyv.mod.gov.ua/kremlivska-m-yasorubka-buryat-okupant-za-oprylyudnennya-faktiv-pro-vtraty-na-peredovu/) of statistics by Captain Vyacheslav Dondokov from Buryatia, who led the 42nd Medical Battalion's tactical group in the area at the time. One single Russian tactical medical group (stabilization point) was receiving over 1,100 wounded per month. According to Ukrainian intelligence, there were at least 11 such groups in the Zaporizhzhia region. This means that in 2023, Russian forces were losing over 12,000 men monthly just due to injuries. Did Romanchuk attempt to improve the situation for his soldiers or take unconventional steps by continuously studying the situation on the front line? The most striking discovery made by analysts at the National Resistance Center (NRC) was that the \"heroic\" general, despite holding the position of commander of a major front, showed no interest in the frontline situation whatsoever. This claim is not an exaggeration—Romanchuk borderline neglected his responsibilities. The Ukrainian Armed Forces had full access to his personal computer and recorded all actions when he used the device. They also had complete access to his email and social media accounts. Romanchuk had a very peculiar way of spending his working hours. According to his computer activity, he spent the majority of his time browsing real estate listings for country houses and apartments for his family... or selecting women on a dating site for personal purposes. This is a complete record of the activities on the work computer of the commander of the Russian Armed Forces in the Zaporizhzhia direction for one day. The date was June 7, 2023, at the height of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Russian commander did nothing on his computer related to military command. The following day, Romanchuk would report on the battle results directly to Putin, as reported by the Russian press. Romanchuk and \"war correspondents\" Another layer of information reveals how Romanchuk gained his reputation as a “wise general.” Most likely, by simply harassing those who disagree with him. A significant part of Romanchuk's correspondence in the Telegram messenger is taken up by a conversation with a user at +7 914 596 6919. In it, Romanchuk often expresses his opinions on certain content from the war. A search by phone number revealed that it belongs to Roman Malyshev. He is a Russian military officer with at least the rank of captain, and, judging by the correspondence, an assistant to Romanchuk. The correspondence with Roman Malyshev is also found in Romanchuk’s email. One of the emails shows that Romanchuk is closely monitoring hostile \"war correspondents\" and even demands action against the \"troublemakers.\" In particular, the channels Two Majors and Thirteenth were recognized as the “troublemakers”. Both of them once wrote about the mistakes of the Russian army in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Yegor Guzenko, who wrote under the pseudonym Thirteenth, has now been arrested for allegedly attacking a police officer. Romanchuk and data on Russian troop positions Romanchuk himself had very little information about the actions of the Russian army on the Zaporizhzhia front due to his lack of interest in his own work. However, through the general, it was possible to gain access to other devices in the headquarters of the Russian grouping on the Zaporizhzhia front. Publishing the obtained information in full is still not possible. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to obtain maps showing the locations of Russian surveillance cameras near the frontline, which they used to monitor the movements of Ukrainian units. Data about the locations of Russian warehouses, observation points, ammunition stockpiles, and troop concentrations was also obtained. These points were marked on an electronic map, as shown in the example from the screenshot. In addition to electronic maps, access was obtained to photographs of detailed paper maps showing the positions of Russian units. Moreover, a substantial amount of documentation on the internal operations of the Russian grouping's headquarters was acquired. This includes combat reports, memos, and various summaries. These summaries reveal that, according to the Russian army, \"there are no losses,\" and drones are supposedly being downed almost barehanded. Here are a few examples, now outdated in terms of intelligence value, for a full assessment.

Despite the triumphant claims by the Russian authorities that mobilization issues exist only in Ukraine, this is far from the truth. The discussion regarding those mobilized specifically to repel Ukraine's offensive in 2023, and their current conditions, is a sensitive topic for the Russian state, though it rarely makes its way to the pages of leading state media. Traces of this issue frequently appear in the posts of the same \"troublesome war correspondents,\" who recount endless instances of the \"disposal\" of mobilized soldiers during assaults. The son of Colonel General Romanchuk, Vladimir Romanchuk, born in 1992, is over 30 years old and fully capable of serving in the military, having also received specialized military education. However, in the summer of 2023, instead of joining the army, the younger Romanchuk embarked on an extended vacation abroad. During the bloody battles and losses of Russian troops in Ukraine, Romanchuk Jr. visited the popular amusement park \"Window of the World\" in Shenzhen, China. He also stopped at a campsite near the beautiful Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan. Meanwhile, those mobilized to repel Ukraine's offensive in 2023 are still kept within the ranks of the Russian army without receiving any substantial contract bonuses, which were introduced later. At the same time, the \"brilliant commander\" Romanchuk continues to earn new awards and fame. - Colonel Alexei Kolomeitsev, the head of the 924th State Center for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles of the Russian Defense Ministry, was [killed](https://global.espreso.tv/russia-ukraine-war-russian-defense-ministry-uav-center-head-kolomeytsev-killed-in-moscow-region)in the Moscow region. - News [More news](https://global.espreso.tv/news?page=2)",

    "text": "O [Serviço Nacional de Meteorologia dos Estados Unidos](https://www.weather.gov/) emitiu um alerta de tempestade geomagnética severa para esta sexta-feira devido a uma série de erupções solares, uma situação que ocorre pela primeira vez em duas décadas. Em comunicado, o Centro de Previsão do Tempo Espacial (SWPC) da Administração Nacional Oceânica e Atmosférica (NOAA) alertou para esta situação particular sobre a qual serão fornecidos mais pormenores nas próximas horas. O que pode acontecer numa tempestade geomagnética? As tempestades geomagnéticas, de acordo com o comunicado, podem afetar a infraestrutura orbital da Terra e a superfície terrestre, interferir nas comunicações, na rede elétrica, na navegação e nas operações de rádio e satélite. A série de erupções começou a 8 de maio e as condições para a persistência da tempestade poderão prolongar-se até ao fim de semana. \"Uma grande mancha solar tem produzido erupções moderadas a muito fortes desde quarta-feira\", afirmou a agência, acrescentando que \"pelo menos cinco destas erupções foram associadas a ejeções de massa coronal solar que parecem estar dirigidas para a Terra\". Estas ejeções são explosões de plasma e campos magnéticos na coroa solar que causam tempestades geomagnéticas quando ocorrem na direção da Terra, explicou a NOAA. A grande mancha solar lançou uma sequência espantosa de cinco ejeções de massa solar em direção à Terra, segundo a plataforma Spacewather.com, que estima que, se fosse um furacão, seria de categoria 04, o segundo mais forte que existe.",

Alors que notre Soleil approche du maximum de l’activité de son cycle, devons-nous nous préparer à affronter une nouvelle fois une telle tempête géomagnétique ?

C'est d'abord la [tache solaire nommée AR3663](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/questions-reponses/soleil-taches-solaires-sont-elles-nommees-19045/) qui s'est montrée hyperactive. À partir du 3 mai dernier, elle a émis pas moins de quatre éruptions de classe X. De quoi propulser AR3663 au rang de tache solaire la plus active du cycle 25. Une tache solaire de « classe Carrington » Dans le même temps, une autre tache solaire, baptisée quant à elle AR3664, est devenue la tache la plus grande de ce cycle solaire. Avec des pôles magnétiques dangereusement proches les uns des autres. Et en deux jours, AR3664 a émis à elle seule pas moins de cinq éjections de masse coronale (CME) en direction de la Terre. De quoi quelque peu enflammer les esprits et imaginer que la Terre pourrait être sur le point de subir à nouveau les conséquences de l' [activité solaire](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/questions-reponses/soleil-top-6-fois-activite-solaire-affecte-terre-18679/).

Et il ne pourrait même, avec l'arrivée en suivant des deux autres CME, que la tempête devienne extrême, de niveau G4. Des [aurores boréales](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/questions-reponses/astronomie-observer-aurores-boreales-australes-5169/) deviendraient alors visibles aux moyennes, voire aux basses [latitudes](/planete/definitions/geographie-latitude-720/)latitudes. À titre de comparaison, si cette tempête solaire annoncée était un [ouragan](/planete/definitions/meteorologie-ouragan-3581/)ouragan, elle serait de catégorie 4. L'événement de Carrington, lui, avait atteint la catégorie 5. Ce jour-là, notre planète entière avait pu profiter du spectacle des [aurores boréales](/sciences/definitions/astronomie-aurore-polaire-16642/)aurores boréales !",

    "text": "La Dirección de Hidrografía y Navegación (Dihidronav) ha pronosticado la continuación de oleajes anómalos de ligera a moderada intensidad hasta el domingo 11 de mayo, lo que ha provocado el cierre de 80 puertos en todo el litoral peruano. Esta medida fue reportada por la Dirección General de Capitanías y Guardacostas (Dicapi) de la Marina de Guerra del Perú y confirmada por el Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil (Indeci), que ha emitido diversas recomendaciones para mitigar los riesgos asociados al fenómeno marítimo.\nLa situación afecta a los puertos del norte, centro y sur del país. En el litoral norte , se encuentran inoperativos puertos como Salaverry, Talara, Malabrigo y Pacasmayo, además de diversas caletas y terminales pesqueros que operan en la zona. Los puertos de Chimbote, Samanco, Huacho y Callao en la zona central también se han visto afectados por este fenómeno, lo que ha alterado el normal flujo de actividades en esos puntos estratégicos. Mientras tanto, en el sur , puertos clave como Punta Picata y Matarani también están cerrados, afectando a la navegación en la zona.\nRecomendaciones frente a oleajes anómalos\nFrente a esta situación, la institución castrense, a través de un reciente aviso especial, advirtió que el estado del mar en el litoral será de cuidado, con oleajes que podrían poner en riesgo la seguridad d e las embarcaciones y las personas. En su comunicado, la Marina exhortó a la población a acatar las disposiciones de seguridad que buscan reducir los riesgos asociados con este fenómeno, incluyendo las recomendaciones del Indeci, que instan a suspender las actividades portuarias y de pesca en las zonas afectadas.\nEl Indeci , además, ha sugerido asegurar las embarcaciones y retirar las flotas pequeñas hacia tierra firme para evitar que las embarcaciones sufran daños o sean arrastradas por el mar agitado. También se ha recomendado evitar actividades deportivas y recreativas en las zonas de playa, así como la realización de campamentos cerca de la costa, debido al peligro que representa el oleaje.\nPuertos afectados por oleajes ligeros a moderados\nLitoral norte:\nPuerto Morín Puerto Salaverry (muelles 1A-1B y 2A-2B) STI Salaverry Terminal Internacional Puerto Malabrigo Puerto Pacasmayo Puerto Talara (muelles Tortuga, Mac Donald, Yeti y San Pedro) Caleta Cherrepe Caleta Guadalupito Caleta Huanchaco Caleta La Barranca Caleta Magdalena de Cao Caleta Lobitos (Talara) Caleta San Pablo Terminal Multiboyas Salaverry Terminal Multiboyas Negritos Terminal Multiboyas Punta Arenas Muelle Artesanal del Terminal Pesquero Salaverry Muelle Carga Líquida Petroperú Muelle Híbrido MU2 Litoral centro:\nPuerto Chimbote Puerto Samanco Puerto Casma Puerto Tambo de Mora Puerto Huacho Puerto Chancay Puerto Chico Puerto Huarmey Puerto Supe Puerto Punta Lobitos (Supe) Puerto San Nicolás Puerto San Juan Puerto Zona Sur (multiboyas Conchán y muelle Unacem Lima) Puerto Bahía Chorrillos Puerto Bahía Pucusana Caleta Santa Caleta Coishco Caleta El Dorado Caleta Los Chimus Caleta Tortugas (Chimbote) Caleta La Gramita Caleta Vegueta Caleta Carquín Caleta Culebras (Supe) Caleta Vidal Caleta Nazca Caleta Lomas Caleta Sagua Caleta Tanaka Caleta Chala Caleta Puerto Viejo Bahía Callao (Rada Interior y Exterior) Muelle Grau Zona Norte A (Pampilla 1, 2 y 3) Zona Norte B (Solgas y Pure Biofuels) Zona Norte C (Tralsa 1, Tralsa 2, Surfisa, Quimpac y Zeta Gas) Terminal Multiboyas Chimbote Terminal BPO Puerto Portuario Chimbote Muelle N° 1 y N° 2 Muelles TPMC N° 1, N° 2, N° 3 y N° 4 Puerto Portuario LNG-Melchorita Terminal Multiboyas Paramonga Muelle Portuario Sider “C” (Chimbote) Litoral sur:\nPuerto Punta Picata Puerto Matarani (muelle Ocean Fish) Caleta Morro Sama Caleta Vila Vila Caleta Atico Caleta El Faro Caleta La Planchada Caleta Quilca Terminal Multiboyas Mollendo Terminal Multiboyas Monte Azul Terminal Portuario Tisur (muelle “C”) Terminal Portuario Tisur (muelle “F”) Muelle Enapu (Ilo) Muelle Engie Muelle Fiscal Ilo Muelle SPCC (Patio Puerto) Desembarcadero Pesquero Artesanal Ilo",

The event featured a panel discussion and a 30-Day Challenge to reinforce the book’s teachings. The book delves into Vedic wisdom, offering practical insights for both Indian and Western audiences. [PTI](/pti-stories)| Mumbai | Updated: 31-05-2024 12:32 IST | Created: 31-05-2024 12:32 IST - Country: - India Global spiritual leader, Vedic scholar, mind management authority and spiritual teacher of millions worldwide, Swami Mukundananda unveiled his latest book Spiritual Secrets From Hinduism. The intellectually engaging event was held at the Radha Krishna Temple of Dallas, amidst hundreds of applauding readers. The author also announced a 30-Day Challenge accompanying the book. The challenge will help solidify the learnings in the book through daily videos, interactive activities and participation points. It is available on the Radha Krishna Bhakti App. This free app offered by JKYog is the world's first AI powered app for Bhakti Yog. The highly anticipated global launch on May 29, 2024, was also broadcast live on Swami Mukundananda YouTube Channel. It featured an insightful panel discussion where Swamiji clarified many spiritual concerns in depth based on the book. These include: the various paths to God in Vedic scriptures, picking one's own spiritual path, the importance of spiritual wisdom in handling emotions, finding a Guru etc. The author particularly pointed out the importance of determining one's life purpose in accordance with one's true nature. He encouraged readers to discover their own Self and thereby start the journey to the Absolute Truth. Attendees appreciated the panel discussion and felt tremendously benefitted by the pristine clarity in Swamiji's Vedic teachings. \"The author explains concepts of the soul, rebirth, and life's higher purpose in a way that's both engaging and easy to comprehend. The book delves into the different paths to God realization: Karma, Jnana, and Bhakti—making profound spiritual concepts accessible and practical. It is an essential read for anyone looking to explore Hinduism, enrich their spiritual journey, and find meaningful ways to apply these timeless teachings in everyday life,\" said Sumitra. Spiritual Secrets From Hinduism was released on May 27 worldwide by Rupa Publications and quickly became a bestseller under the Spiritual Self Help and Hinduism categories. It reveals the deepest eternal truths in Hinduism known to the wisest seers of India across millenia. It offers a complete guide to Vedic wisdom for discovering one's true life purpose and experiencing the Absolute Truth. Preeti Malhotra, a reader, states, \"Swami Mukundananda's \"Spiritual Secrets from Hinduism\" presents a comprehensive perspective of Hinduism—with all its glory and learnings. It is brimming with wisdom and practical insights—a perfect resource for those seeking to deepen their understanding of eternal spiritual precepts and embark on their transformative journey of self-discovery and connection with the Divine.\" There exists an inherent curiosity to understand the concepts of Hinduism, read its scriptures, and visit the country that is the spiritual leader of the world. However, without proper guidance, such endeavors to fathom the wide spectrum of teachings of Hinduism do not succeed, despite the best intentions. \"The author explains that the Vedic knowledge is non-sectarian and presents answers to existential questions like 'Who am I?', 'What is the purpose of my life?', 'What should I do to be fulfilled?'etc. If we do not ponder and have meaningful answers to these questions then life becomes uninspiring and a chore to be endured.\" This book makes the perennial principles of Sanatana Dharma accessible for Indian and Western audiences to better grasp and apply its concepts in daily life to uplift the soul towards its highest purpose of God realization, and eternal bliss. You can purchase the book on Amazon USA and Amazon India. For availability in other countries, please email queries@jkyog.in.
