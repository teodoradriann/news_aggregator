    "text": "SAN DIEGO (KGTV) – Dennis Andersen’s been looking out at the waves at ocean beach through his camera lens for nearly 30 years. “There much bigger today than they have been,” Andersen said. “Compared to a normal day around here which is a two to three maybe four swells. These are three times the size. And then on Saturday, they’re supposed to be four to five times the size.” San Diego Fire-Rescue told ABC 10News on Thursday that the National Weather Service is issuing three different advisories with the high surf starting Thursday through early Monday morning. “This is would be expert only. We always ask people to do their own self inventory, what have you been doing to train to surf in these kinds of waves,” Lt. Lonnie Stephens, San Diego Fire-Rescue, said when it comes to safety regarding the waves. Lieutenant Stephens told ABC 10News their recommendation is to stay out of the water all together if you aren’t experienced. One surfer says that’s smart way to look at the swell. “I mean you wouldn’t want to learn in this weather that’s for sure. These little white water guys; you could go out in that. You just wouldn’t want to get too close to the Pier that’s where the rip is and you’ll get pulled out. So, don’t want that,” Casey Stroosma said. Stephens said if you’re hanging out on the shore, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t watch the waves. “There might not be big waves for 5 minutes. They got out of their car, or they walk down on to the tide pool and then a 10-to-20-foot wave sets come through and wash a whole family into the ocean,” Stephens said. Ocean will be bringing big waves but, Stephens said extra lifeguards and all equipment like these jet skis and boats will be at the ready to help someone in need. As we wait for the waves to weaken on Monday morning, the message is very simple. “This is life threatening conditions so, if you’re not an experienced ocean swimmer or surfer then you should stay out of the water,” Stephens said. And watch from a distance like Dennis. “I would heed the advice. It’s dangerous out there,” Andersen said. “You see me I’m totally dry. I’ve surfed for years, and I wouldn’t go out in it.” Lieutenant Stephens with fire-Rescue also said rip currents can be hazardous and deadly on a calm day; when you have big waves, everything is multiplied.",

    "text": "In the decade-plus history of the cryptocurrency industry, this year has been particularly challenging. Factors like wars and interest rate hikes put global capital markets under pressure, and the crypto industry faced its Lehman moment, along with frequent hacker attacks. Amidst this downturn, we still witnessed the smooth progress of Ethereum's merger and the return of the Layer2 wave, demonstrating the vitality and anti-fragility of the crypto industry. Persistence often leads to hope. In 2022, alongside the crypto industry, BISSNEX maintained a healthy respect for risk without losing control. This approach led to our contrarian growth this year, completing several funding rounds, and establishing an independent ecological fund and educational academy to help propel the industry forward - all valuable achievements in overcoming challenges. In April, BISSNEX successfully completed its second round of funding, garnering interest from renowned investment institutions Paradigm and NGC Ventures. This support solidified our position and foresight in the crypto industry. With more stable financial backing, BISSNEX laid a solid foundation for future innovations and expansions, significantly aiding our product development plans. June saw the establishment of the independent ecological fund, BISSNEX Labs, a milestone development. The lab operates globally, focusing on asset management product issuance, media collaboration, and crypto-economic research. It rigorously evaluates potential investment projects from multiple dimensions and focuses on linking the crypto industry supply chain, helping high-value projects in various fields gain support and contribute back to the industry's growth. Following some regrettable black swan events in the crypto industry, we aimed to make a meaningful impact, particularly for less experienced investors. In September, we began building BISSNEX College, an important initiative to help users better enter the crypto industry. On this specially designed educational platform, we offer a wealth of course resources, including basics of cryptocurrencies, trading skills, and investment strategies. BISSNEX College, as a robust learning platform, helps many users learn to cope with the crises and challenges of the crypto market. We believe that only through in-depth learning and understanding can investors succeed in a competitive and rapidly changing market. During dark times, light becomes more noticeable. Amid the turbulent crypto market, BISSNEX withstood external pressures and tests, receiving more offers of collaboration. In December, we welcomed a new wave of investment from Multicoin Capital and Pantera Capital. During the bear market, this achievement brought us exhilarating strength. The collaboration with these two VCs provides more financial and strategic support for BISSNEX. We will fully utilize this opportunity to invest more time and effort in product development, technology upgrades, and global market expansion. We particularly focus on upgrading our overall security system and more comprehensive risk monitoring to better serve our users. Time doesn't speak but gives answers, and navigating through cycles is BISSNEX's answer this year. A good crypto trading platform requires a holistic view of technology, team, product, service, and risk resistance. From this perspective, BISSNEX is already one of the leading exchanges in the crypto industry. We remain clear-headed amidst the fog, cautious and focused in a rapidly evolving field, striving to make BISSNEX a beacon of light illuminating the entire crypto industry.

It is given a severity score of 9.0 (critical) and is described as an unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow. “Successful exploitation could result in remote unauthenticated code execution, leading to potential downstream compromise of a victim network,” it said.\nThe second vulnerability, also a stack-based buffer overflow, has a severity score of 7.0 (high).\nNew malware deployed The company urged customers to apply the patch immediately and provided further details about the threat actors and their tools.\nIn collaboration with security researchers from Mandiant Ivanti determined that the first vulnerability has been exploited in the wild as a zero-day, most likely by multiple threat actors.\nIn at least one of the compromised VPNs, Mandiant found the threat actors deploying the SPAWN ecosystem of malware (including the SPAWNANT installer, the SPAWNMOLE tunneler, and the SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor).\nSign up for the Ny Breaking newsletter and get all the best news, opinions, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe group behind this attack was identified as UNC5221, which is apparently a Chinese spy group, active since December 2023.\nIn the past, UNC5221 has been associated with the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN devices, targeting telecommunications, healthcare, and public sector organizations. The group focuses on data exfiltration and espionage.\nMendiant has also seen criminals drop previously invisible malware, now tracked as DRYHOOK and PHASEJAM. They could not attribute these families to a known threat actor.\n“It is possible that multiple actors are responsible for the creation and deployment of these different code families (i.e. SPAWN, DRYHOOK, and PHASEJAM), but at the time of publishing this report we do not have sufficient data to accurately assess the number of threat actors. targeting CVE-2025-0282,” Ivanti said in the report.\nYou might also like it",
