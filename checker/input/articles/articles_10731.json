    "text": "Preparing for change in a well-established, well-capitalized industry is not easy.\nSuch is the story for ticker symbol BYND, formally known as Beyond Meat (BYND) in supermarket aisles across the US.\nWhile Beyond Meat's stock price has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown has not. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry executive is focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n“We believe the cycle of history is in our favor and we're going to turn it into long-term success,” Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above). ,\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business.\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar with a spectacular initial public offering on Nasdaq on May 5, 2019.\nInvestors gobbled up shares of a company they viewed as a leader in the emerging plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 per share, opened for trading at $46 and then rose to $65.75 by the close. Profit at the closing bell: a delicious 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite on May 2, 2019 in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, including big deals with global restaurant chains like Yum! The brand is planning expansion into the refrigerated food sections of retailers such as KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (YUM), Target (TGT) and overseas, and efforts are underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. Are.\nBy July 2019, Beyond Meat shares reached a peak of $234.90 per share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry, and its financial impact sent people turning back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat's impressive momentum has stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including rival Impossible Foods.\nAdditionally, attacks from strong parties in the meat industry and media on the healthfulness of plant-based items have damaged Beyond Meat's standing with consumers. By November 2022, as losses hit cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its employees.\nThen in November this year, Beyond Meat – which has cut prices to stimulate demand – said it would cut 19% of its non-production workforce after a lower-than-expected third quarter.\nThird-quarter sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million based on adjusted operating profit.\n“You know there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and especially after the IPO,” Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round. “It was going to happen overnight.” Retrenchment. “This has clearly not been proven to be the case.”\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: surround yourself with great people, take a long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course.\n“But the reason we started this company and the reason consumers are reaching out to a product is getting stronger day by day, whether it's the health aspect, whether it's climate, whether it's energy and Whether it's water use or animal welfare,” Brown added. , “All of those issues are becoming serious, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.”\nToday, Beyond Meat's stock is trading at $8.95 per share – well below its staggering post-IPO high. According to comparative data from Yahoo Finance, the company has a market cap of $577.6 million, while Meat King Tyson (TSN) has a market cap of $18.46 billion.\n“In terms of the reasons for the softening in the US, it's pretty much the same: consumers continue to shy away from the category for a number of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or lack thereof),” said JPMorgan packaged foods analyst Kane. Are included.” Goldman said.\nGoldman has given Beyond Meat shares an underweight rating, which is equivalent to a sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) inside their new El Segundo, California headquarters about the path forward for the plant-based meat company. (Yahoo Finance)\nBrown, meanwhile, is focused on dismissing the critics. Beyond Meat recently opened a massive 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California, just steps away from the headquarters of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The space is equipped with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a typically open floor plan that could herald the next big thing in plant-based dining.\nThe new facility also features a McDonald's (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 tall Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often walks around the building to interact with staff with his trademark calm, welcoming atmosphere.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won't be easy and he's not in the mindset to consider the business path forward yet at this point. But he will not shy away from his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and passion.\n“I want to see [my mission] Until completion,” Brown said. ''I think it would be something [that] When it's all said and done, I'll look back. But I'm in a fight right now, so it's hard to watch.”\nbrian sozzi is the executive editor of Yahoo Finance.

    "title": "13-Year-Old Girl Dead Following Severe Allergic Reaction To One Sip Of Hot Chocolate",
    "text": "Hannah Jacobs, a 13-year-old with severe allergies to dairy, fish, and eggs, died within hours of drinking a hot chocolate beverage from the Costa Coffee shop in London.\nAbimbola Duyile, the victim’s mother, told an East London Coroner’s Court that she told the staff a bout her daughter’s severe allergy to dairy products and requested that they clean the equipment to avoid cross-contamination. Duyile said she was being “extra picky” because of the severity of her daughter’s allergies.\n“I made sure the staff were aware that this was not a joke,” the mother said, according to The Telegraph .\nCosta’s policy states that when customers disclose their dietary restrictions, workers should show them a book that includes ingredients and details about how the drink is made. Urmi Akter, the worker who took the order, said she did not show the book to Duyile.\n“I did not show the mother the book as she told me washing the jug was fine. I thought she, as the mother, would know more about [it]”, Akter said, according to BBC News.\nReports show that Akter was told she did not have to answer questions if she felt they would incriminate her. As she testified, she had a Bengali interpreter with her. She declined to answer whether she was trained in her native language or if she received refresher courses. When asked if she knew what an allergen was, Akter declined to answer.\nAkter claims that the mother ordered one extra hot and one normal hot chocolate and didn’t ask for soy milk. She only asked that the milk jug be cleaned between making drinks.\nForensic analysis of the coffee cups found no traces of soy milk but “’substantial levels” of milk proteins.\nAfter purchasing the drinks, the mother and daughter visited a nearby dentist’s office. The 13-year-old took a sip of the drink and had an immediate allergic reaction.\nHannah then went to a pharmacy and received a 150mcg adrenaline Auto-Injector epi pen—a dosage recommended for children aged six and under. Hannah’s doctor said it was hard to predict if she would have survived if she had been given the recommended dosage of 300 mcg.\n“150mcg was certainly too small a dose to be given,” he told the court, according to The Herald .",

    "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Finding the Best Orthodontist Los Angeles",
    "text": "Are you on the hunt for the perfect orthodontist Los Angeles to transform your smile? Look no further! In this comprehensive guide, we’ll walk you through all the steps and considerations to ensure you find the best orthodontist for your needs. From qualifications and experience to patient reviews and treatment options, we’ve got everything you need to make an informed decision. Say goodbye to crooked teeth and hello to a flawless smile – let’s find your ideal orthodontic specialist together!\nIntroduction to Orthodontics Los Angeles\nOrthodontics is a branch of dentistry that specializes in correcting misaligned teeth and jaws. It involves using various techniques and appliances to straighten teeth, improve oral function, and enhance the overall appearance of the smile. In Los Angeles, there is a high demand for orthodontic services due to the city’s focus on beauty and aesthetics.\nWith so many options available, finding the best\northodontist Los Angeles can be overwhelming. However, it is crucial to carefully choose an orthodontist as they will be responsible for your oral health and appearance.\nThe most common type of orthodontic treatment is braces – metal or ceramic brackets attached to the teeth and connected by wires that gradually shift them into proper alignment. In recent years, clear aligners have gained popularity as a more discreet alternative to traditional braces. These are custom-made plastic trays that fit over your teeth and apply gentle pressure to move them into place.\nWhy Choosing the Right Orthodontist Matters\nChoosing the right orthodontist for your orthodontic treatment is a crucial decision. Orthodontic treatment involves making significant changes to your teeth and bite, which can have a long-lasting impact on your oral health and overall well-being. That’s why it is essential to carefully consider who you entrust with your smile.\nOne of the primary reasons why choosing the right orthodontist matters is their level of expertise and experience. Orthodontics is a specialized field in dentistry that requires additional training and education beyond dental school. A skilled and experienced orthodontist has undergone rigorous training and has extensive knowledge of correcting misaligned teeth, bite issues, and other orthodontic problems. They are also familiar with various treatment methods, techniques, and materials used in orthodontics, allowing them to determine the most suitable treatment plan for each patient.\nMoreover, when you choose an experienced\northodontist near me, you can expect high-quality care throughout your entire treatment journey. This includes accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment plans tailored to your specific needs, precise execution of procedures using advanced technology and tools, as well as regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress.\nQualities to Look for in an Orthodontist\nWhen it comes to choosing the right orthodontist for you or your family, there are certain qualities that you should look for in order to ensure a positive and successful experience. Not all orthodontists are created equal, so it is important to do some research and consider the following factors before making your decision.\n-\nEducation and Experience:\nOne of the most important qualities to look for in an orthodontist is their education and experience. A good orthodontist should have completed a specialized program in orthodontics from an accredited institution. They should also have several years of experience practicing as an orthodontist, with a track record of successful treatments.\n- Certification and Membership:\nIt is essential to choose an orthodontist who is certified by the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO). This certification ensures that the orthodontist has undergone rigorous training and testing to provide high-quality care. Additionally, look for an orthodontist who is a member of professional organizations such as the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) or the American Dental Association (ADA), as this shows their commitment to staying updated on the latest techniques and technologies in the field.\n-\nSpecialization:\nWhile all dentists can perform basic orthodontic procedures, it is best to choose an orthodontist who specializes exclusively in this area of dentistry. They will have more knowledge and expertise when it comes to correcting complex issues such as misaligned teeth or bite problems.\n-\nGood Communication Skills:\nEffective communication between patients and their orthodontists is crucial for a successful treatment journey. Look for an orthodontist who takes the time to listen to your concerns, answer any questions you may have, and explain each step of your treatment plan in detail.\n- Patience and Empathy:\nOrthodontic treatment often requires multiple visits over an extended period of time, which can be challenging for some patients – especially children. A good orthodontist should have patience and understanding towards their patients, making them feel comfortable and at ease throughout the treatment process.\nTypes of Orthodontic Treatments Available in Los Angeles\nLos Angeles is known for its glamorous lifestyle, but it’s also home to some of the best orthodontists in the country. If you’re considering getting orthodontic treatment in this city, you’ll have a variety of options to choose from. Here are some of the most common types of orthodontic treatments available in Los Angeles.\n-\nTraditional Metal Braces\nTraditional metal braces are still one of the most popular and effective ways to straighten teeth. They consist of metal brackets that are bonded to the teeth and connected by wires and elastic bands. The wires apply gentle pressure to gradually shift the teeth into their desired positions. These braces can treat a wide range of dental issues, including crooked teeth, overcrowding, and bite problems.\n- Ceramic Braces\nIf you want a more discreet option than traditional metal braces, ceramic braces may be a good choice for you. They work similarly to metal braces but use tooth-colored or clear brackets that blend in with your teeth. This makes them less noticeable and more aesthetically pleasing than traditional braces.\n- Lingual Braces\nLingual braces are another discreet option for straightening teeth. Like traditional metal braces, they use metal brackets and wires; however, they are placed on the back (lingual) surfaces of the teeth instead of the front. This makes them virtually invisible from the outside but requires specialized training and equipment from an experienced orthodontist.\n- Invisalign\nInvisalign has become increasingly popular over recent years due to its convenience and virtually invisible appearance. This treatment involves using a series of custom-made clear aligners that fit snugly over your teeth and gradually move them into place over time. The aligners can be easily removed for eating, brushing, and flossing.\n- Damon Braces\nDamon braces combine elements from traditional metal braces with advanced technology for faster treatment time and fewer adjustments needed. They use a self-ligating system, meaning the brackets have a built-in mechanism to hold the wire in place without elastic bands. This reduces friction and minimizes discomfort during treatment.\nHow to Find the Best Orthodontist in Los Angeles: Tips and Tricks\nFinding the best orthodontist in Los Angeles can seem like a daunting task, especially with so many options available. However, by following some key tips and tricks, you can easily narrow down your search and find the perfect orthodontist for your needs.\n- Ask for Recommendations: One of the best ways to find a great orthodontist is to ask for recommendations from friends, family, or even your general dentist. They can provide insight into their personal experiences and help steer you towards a reputable and reliable orthodontist.\n- Do Your Research: Once you have some potential candidates, it’s important to do your own research as well. Look up their credentials, experience, and any reviews or testimonials from previous patients. This will give you an idea of their reputation and success rate.\n- Consider Their Specialties: Orthodontists often have different areas of expertise such as Invisalign, traditional braces, or surgical procedures. Make sure to choose an orthodontist whose specialties align with your specific needs.\n- Check Their Technology: When it comes to orthodontic treatment, technology plays a crucial role in achieving optimal results. Look for an orthodontist who uses modern equipment and techniques that can make the process more comfortable and efficient.\n- Schedule Consultations: Most reputable orthodontists offer free consultations where you can discuss treatment options and get a feel for their practice. Take advantage of these consultations to ask questions about their approach to treatment and get a sense of how comfortable you feel with them.\nQuestions to Ask During a Consultation with an Orthodontist\nChoosing the right orthodontist for your oral health needs is a crucial decision. This person will be responsible for aligning and improving the appearance of your teeth, which can have a significant impact on your overall well-being. That’s why it’s essential to schedule a consultation with an orthodontist before making any decisions about treatment.\nDuring this initial meeting, you’ll have the opportunity to get to know the orthodontist, their practice, and their approach to treatment. It’s also an excellent chance for you to ask questions and gather information that will help you make an informed decision about your oral health care.\nTo ensure that you get the most out of your consultation with an orthodontist in Los Angeles, here are some essential questions to ask:\n- What are my treatment options?\nIt’s important to understand what types of treatments are available and suitable for your specific dental needs. Ask about traditional braces, clear aligners such as Invisalign, or other alternatives like lingual braces or self-ligating braces.\n- How long will my treatment take?\nOrthodontic treatments can vary in duration depending on the severity of the case and type of treatment used. It’s best to understand how long you can expect to undergo treatment so that you can plan accordingly.\n-\nCan I see before-and-after photos of previous patients?\nIt’s always helpful to see tangible results from previous patients who have undergone similar treatments. Requesting before-and-after photos can give you a better idea of what kind of results you can expect from this particular orthodontist.\n-\nWhat are the costs associated with my recommended treatment plan?\nOrthodontic treatments can be costly, so it’s essential to know what financial commitment is expected upfront and throughout the course of treatment.\n- Are there any potential risks or side effects associated with my recommended treatment plan?\nAs with any medical procedure, there may be potential risks or side effects associated with orthodontic treatments. It’s crucial to discuss these with your orthodontist and understand how they may affect you.",

La relación va viento en popa y hay rumores que indican que el cantante de cumbia 420 le habría pedido compromiso a la conductora.\nTodo comenzó a raíz de un video y una foto que publicó la empresaria en su cuenta de Instagram, que llamó la atención de sus 17 millones de seguidores por un sugestivo detalle.\nLeé también: Yanina Latorre mostró el video de Wanda Nara en la cama con Keita Baldé: “Es mucha intimidad”\nEn el clip que compartió, se puede ver la mano de la rubia, en la que luce un impresionante anillo de diamantes que se enrolla en su dedo como una serpiente.

    "text": "[Celtic](/cronologia/-/meta/celtic) Atrás está quedando la amarga eliminación de Honduras en el repechaje de cara a la Copa América en el que Costa Rica nos bailó en Frisco, Texas. Luis Palma, futbolista del Celtic de Escocia, fue una de las 11 sensibles bajas que tuvo la Selección Nacional de Honduras en ese desafortunado encuentro. \"El Bicho\" se hizo un resonancia magnética en suelo europeo y luego de esos exámenes se confirmó que estaría de baja por cuatro semanas por sufrir una lesión muscular grado I del tercio proximal del soleo derecho. Esto complicó aún más el panorama para el entrenador [Reinaldo Rueda](https://www.laprensa.hn/deportes/seleccion-honduras-nuevo-asistente-tecnico-giovanni-hernandez-reinaldo-rueda-fenafuth-FJ17871004), que aseveró que las lesiones de jugadores importantes afectaron la clasificación de Honduras al evento internacional. No obstante, tras más de un mes alejado de las canchas de juego, Diario LA PRENSA ha podido conocer que el delantero hondureño regresará a la convocatoria del [Celtic ](https://www.laprensa.hn/deportes/luis-palma-celtic-amistosos-estados-unidos-manchester-city-chelsea-dc-united-EI18238387)de Escocia en el clásico ante el Rangers. Este compromiso está programado a realizarse el domingo 7 de abril a partir de las 5 de la mañana. Brendan Rodgers ya tiene el alta médica de [Luis Palma](https://www.laprensa.hn/deportes/luis-palma-celtic-amistosos-estados-unidos-manchester-city-chelsea-dc-united-EI18238387) y el catracho estará en este partidazo por el título liguero. El 28 de febrero fue la fecha del último juego del hondureño en la vapuleada 7-1 sobre el Dundee United. El ceibeño jugó 16 minutos. Sin embargo, el ex Vida se perdió los duelos ante Livingston, St. Jhonstone, Hearts y el trascendental duelo ante Costa Rica por el último boleto al repechaje de Copa América 2024. Es de resaltar que Palma es pieza clave en el engranaje de la Selección Nacional que dirige Reinaldo Rueda. El ariete estará para los primeros dos juegos de la Eliminatoria Mundialista rumbo a United 2026.",

    "text": "México emite alerta en el sistema eléctrico por ola de calor por tercer día consecutivo\nPaulina Nares\n(CNN Español) — El Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Cenace) declaró este jueves un nuevo “estado operativo de alerta” en el Sistema Interconectado Nacional tras dos jornadas el martes y miércoles, registrados en varios estados de México, debido a la alta demanda de energía y a una caída en la capacidad de generación eléctrica.\n“A partir de las 15:02 horas del 9 de mayo de 2024 se declara estado operativo de alerta en el Sistema Interconectado Nacional, por lo que el Cenace llevará a cabo las acciones operativas conducentes”, indicó la instancia en una tarjeta informativa, sin dar mayores detalles.\nDesde el martes se han registrado cortes al suministro eléctrico en varios estados del país que, dependiendo del lugar, se mantuvieron por minutos u horas, informó el Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Cenace) en un comunicado.\nEntre los estados afectados el martes por los apagones figuran Ciudad de México, Estado de México, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Zacatecas, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Puebla, Nuevo León, Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Chihuahua, Campeche, Aguascalientes y Yucatán, según reportaron usuarios en redes sociales y medios locales.\nDesde su habitual conferencia matutina, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, dijo el miércoles que los apagones del martes se registraron por la intensa ola de calor que azota a gran parte del territorio mexicano.\n“Y el Cenace, que es el que controla la distribución de energía, tiene sistemas de alarma, y se estableció la alarma y por poco tiempo, no en todo el país tuvieron apagones. Afortunadamente se restableció de nuevo todo el sistema de energía eléctrica”, dijo el presidente, quien agregó que se trató de algo excepcional, y que fue un evento “inesperado”.\nEl martes, el Cenace informó en un comunicado que algunas plantas salieron de operación o disminuyeron la generación de electricidad, por lo que en dos ocasiones el Sistema Interconectado Nacional (SIN) entró en estado operativo de emergencia.\nLa primera alerta —precisó el organismo público en el comunicado— se inició a las 5:04 p. m. (hora local) y finalizó a las 5:52 p. m. después de que se alcanzara una demanda de 48.472 megavatios (MW). La segunda alerta del día comenzó a las 7:10 p. m. (hora local) ante el alto requerimiento de energía eléctrica y una reducción en la capacidad de generación.\nA las 8:10 p. m. se inició la reconexión del suministro eléctrico afectado, agregó el documento.\n¿Qué significan las alertas?\nEsas alertas buscan informar a los mexicanos si, por algún motivo, el Sistema Eléctrico Nacional (SEN) entra en estado operativo de emergencia, que puede resultar en cortes de energía a lo largo del país.\nTambién pueden activarse por los fenómenos naturales extremos, como huracanes, tormentas, oleadas de calor o frío extremo.\nLos apagones y el caso Jorge Glas están unidos por el crimen organizado, dice analista política\nCNN ha solicitado información a la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) y al Cenace, pero hasta el momento no hay respuesta.\nEsta jornada de cortes de energía se dio en medio de las altas temperaturas que afectan a gran parte de México por una ola de calor, que este martes registró un récord en Ciudad de México al alcanzar los 33,4 grados Celsius, según el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) en las instalaciones del Observatorio de Tacubaya. Esta cifra rebaso el récord del 7 de mayo de 2003 de 33 grados Celsius.\nLas altas temperaturas que ha registrado México este año han provocado el incremento del uso de energía en negocios y casas, donde se utilizan ventiladores eléctricos para intentar paliar el calor.\nLos apagones como efecto del cambio climático\nExpertos consultados por CNN refieren que los apagones en México, y otros países, son resultado del cambio climático, pero también del “deterioro” de un sistema eléctrico que no ha tenido la inversión gubernamental que requiere.\n“Por el lado de la generación eléctrica, México está atravesando una sequía bastante importante y exceptuando las hidroeléctricas que se localizan en el sur del país, las otras hidroeléctricas están registrando niveles extremadamente bajos, no están contribuyendo lo que en años anteriores a la generación eléctrica, dijo a CNN Gonzalo Monroy, director general de GMEC y especialista en el sector energético de México y Estados Unidos.\nMonroy dijo que además de la planta de Puerto Peñasco, en el norteño estado de Sonora, durante el sexenio del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador no se ha construido una planta de generación de electricidad nueva.\n“Ha habido esta hostilidad hacia la generación de energía privada de electricidad, principalmente en energías renovables, que ha derivado incluso en acciones de inconstitucionalidad y en tratar de detener cambios a la ley”, señaló.\nLa coordinadora del programa Competencia y Regulación de la organización México Evalúa, Ana Lilia Moreno, señala que los apagones registrados este martes en la mitad del país “son síntomas del cambio climático”.\n“Estas olas de calor son parte de este calentamiento global que los científicos suplican se detenga”, indicó Moreno. “En México tenemos territorio muy susceptible de afectaciones climáticas, tanto como el lado de la sequía y las consecuencias que esto tiene para el abasto hídrico, no solo de los seres humanos, animales y plantas, sino de la energía hidroeléctrica, que es uno de los principales motores de la generación (eléctrica) en México”.\nEn su cuenta de la red social X el senador Julen Rementeria, coordinador del grupo parlamentario del opositor Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), aseguró que desde el 19 de junio de 2019 solicitó en la Comisión de Energía la comparecencia del titular del Cenace, Ricardo Octavio Mota, por los apagones que venían, y compartió un video del 17 de junio de 2021 en el que advertía sobre el tema.\nEsta nota ha sido actualizada.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Los propietarios de los contenidos con derechos, en colaboración con la policía, están desplegando todos sus recursos para poner fin a las transmisiones ilegales de fútbol y a los miles de listas IPTV pirata que abundan en Internet. Consideran que el acceso gratuito a los canales de televisión de pago representa un riesgo significativo para la seguridad de los usuarios y una amenaza para la integridad de sus contenidos. Las autoridades advierten que las listas IPTV pueden contener malware o virus que pueden infectar los dispositivos . Sin embargo, más allá de los riesgos, el verdadero motivo detrás de estos esfuerzos es la pérdida millonaria que sufren los propietarios de los derechos . A pesar de la activación del Piracy Shield , diseñado para combatir la piratería, ha resultado ser un desastre . Es por esta razón que las autoridades están aumentando la presión hacia los proveedores de servicios de Internet (ISP) para acabar con la transmisión de fútbol a través de IPTV. La Premier League , por ejemplo, ha enviado una clara advertencia a quienes piratean su contenido, y es que recientemente logró que las autoridades condenaran a Le Hai Nam, por infracción de derechos de autor y una multa de 16,000 dólares (14,900 euros). Ahora, el siguiente paso de la liga es presionar a los ISP , y es por esta razón que está llevando a cabo un caso legal contra la empresa de alojamiento de sitios web GoDaddy. En una carta enviada por el equipo legal de la liga de fútbol de Inglaterra, Hagan Noll & Boyle LLC , afirman que existen 28 servicios y sitios web de IPTV que la Premier League considera que infringen los derechos de autor . De ganar esta nueva demanda, además de exigir que GoDaddy elimine dichas webs, la Premier League también podría solicitar específicamente que la empresa proporcione la información de los streamers ilegales, incluidos números de teléfono, direcciones de correo electrónico y detalles de pago. Esta información sería utilizada por Hagan Noll & Boyle LLC para tomar medidas legales directas contra los infractores y hacer cumplir sus derechos de autor de manera más efectiva. Los propietarios están luchando contra la transmisión ilegal de fútbol por IPTV para proteger y salvaguardar la integridad de sus contenidos. A través de acciones legales, están trabajando para acabar con esta práctica y garantizar un entorno de entretenimiento seguro y legal para todas las personas.",

    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER: MoDOT urges preparedness ahead of ice and snow\nSPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Even if you’re driving cautiously, icy roads can quickly turn into an accident, which could leave you stranded in the bitter cold for a while.\nTemperatures next week could be below zero, but you still have a few days to stock your vehicle with the essentials.\nDistrict Maintenance Engineer Jimmy Shannon with the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) said, “It’s good to make sure that you’ve got warm clothing, something to keep you warm, and an emergency roadside kit so that you can protect yourself.”\nA proper winter emergency checklist should also include nonperishable food, water, a flashlight, a full tank of gas, and kitty litter or sand to help regain traction if your vehicle becomes stuck.\nMoDOT’s fleet of 293 trucks will begin treating roads as early as Saturday. Drivers are advised to stay alert and give road crews plenty of space to operate.\n“They’re making the roadways clear, so it’s much safer to travel,” Shannon said, “just make sure you give them plenty of room. Don’t get too close or crowd them.”\nIt’s recommended to stay 200 feet behind snow plows if possible. Shannon’s number one advice? Avoid driving altogether if possible.\nEmma Sneed, who was unaware of the pending winter storm, shared her preparation plans.\n“Honestly, I just got my food, water, and snacks,” Sneed said, “I’m getting gas now, so I’ll be ready to stay safe.\nSneed’s vigilance comes after a personal experience with icy roads last year that left her truck totaled.\n“I just got into a wreck not too long ago because of the ice,” she said, discouraged, “totaled my truck. Definitely from experience, stay safe out there.”\nThis time, Sneed is planning to avoid the roads entirely, choosing a staycation with her pet cat, Two, instead.\n“Definitely staying off the roads, especially with this little one in the car,” she said, turning to Two, “I’m going to keep you safe.”\nMoDOT encourages everyone to plan ahead, stay informed about weather conditions, and prioritize safety this weekend.\nThe biggest challenge is the timing of the rain. If it washes away the pre-treatment, it will leave a clean slate for snow and ice accumulation.\nFor real-time updates on road conditions, visit\n[MoDOT’s Traveler Information Map.](https://traveler.modot.org/map/index.html)\nTo report a correction or typo, please email\n[digitalnews@ky3.com](mailto:digitalnews@ky3.com).
