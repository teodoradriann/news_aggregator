    "title": "Missouri Education Officials Lower GPA Threshold for Teacher Certification",
    "text": "Officials believe lowering a GPA requirement for teachers will improve recruitment and retention without reducing educator quality. Put Students First: Support Journalism That Exposes Truth and Inspires Action. Donate to The 74 Missouri educators will no longer need a 3.0 grade-point average in their subject area to teach in public schools beginning in July, the State Board of Education unanimously voted Tuesday. The threshold to be qualified to teach in the state is now a 2.5 grade-point average in the teacher’s content area. The only exception will be special-education teachers, who will still be required to meet the 3.0 mark. Officials with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Educations say the change is intended to increase the number of certificated teachers coming into public schools. Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said in a statement that the change would remove “unnecessary barriers to the teaching profession.” “There is no evidence tying a particular GPA in the content area to more effective teaching,” Daryl Fridley, the department’s education preparation coordinator, told the board on Tuesday. “Most of the non-teaching professional options in sciences, math and history do not require such a high GPA.” A 3.0 GPA requirement most impacts teachers in STEM subjects, he said. When the department looked at teacher candidates who met other requirements but didn’t meet the GPA standard, nearly a quarter of those disqualified were in STEM. Teacher candidates still must pass a performance assessment, with a test of subject knowledge, to be certified. Of those who didn’t meet the GPA requirements, 90% passed the performance assessment, Fridley said. The department hopes the new requirements will bring more teachers into the profession. Currently, almost 44% of first-year teachers are certified in Missouri. Over a quarter are serving as a substitute teacher, 6% have no certification and the rest have alternative certifications. “Discussions about this issue often include the question, ‘Isn’t this a case of lowering standards?’” Fridley said. “We maintain that with a third of the state’s first year teachers having no more than a substitute teacher certificate and some with even less, any action that leads to a higher proportion of first-year teachers completing the preparation program is actually a net gain for the overall quality of teachers.” In the midst of low teacher retention rates and poor recruitment, the change is welcome, the department reiterated. “Both quantity and quality of teachers are really important to the learning of students,” Paul Katnik, assistant commissioner of educator quality, said during Tuesday’s meeting. The department reiterated that it doesn’t believe the lower GPA threshold will affect teacher quality. A 2019 study out of Texas showed that there was no improvement in achievement outcomes between a 2.5 GPA and 2.75 GPA requirement. Increasing the threshold to 3.0 excluded 44% of education students and brought a small increase on teachers’ evaluations. The study concludes a “higher GPA criteria would also have minimal impact on the quality of our nation’s teachers.” Carol Hallquist, vice president of the State Board of Education, said she was initially wary of lowering the GPA standard but is now “totally supportive.” “When I reached out to principals and people who are in teacher preparation programs, they said there was no correlation and were very supportive,” she said. “They also said that you have to pass licensing tests, and that is really what we want to look at.” Doug Hayter, executive director of the Missouri Association of School Administrators, told The Independent he has been speaking to the department about the GPA requirements and is optimistic. “There is a balance where we need to have requirements that mean something, but the research that they have seems to indicate that this change would not have a substantial impact on teacher effectiveness,” he said. “As long as that’s the case, we want to give educators as many options as possible in a world where there’s still a lot of open positions in regard to public education.” Further helping open doors for new teachers is the reinstatement of a general science certification for high school educators. The department has required science teachers to specialize in an area, like chemistry or biology, but now will bring back a certification for generalists with a broader knowledge base. “The reinstatement of this general science certificate will create opportunities for more students to choose to be science teachers, not by lowering standards, but instead by creating a path in which the standards are more aligned with the needs of schools,” Fridley said. Hayter expects the change to impact districts statewide, saying that “every little bit helps” to recruit teachers. “This is one small part of a bigger picture of making sure that we have very effective educators in our classrooms moving forward,” he said. The “bigger picture,” Hayter said, includes boosting teacher pay and making schools welcoming for educators.

    "text": "A Hamas hostage shocked the UN as she recounted the torture she endured in Gaza: “I was raped and hung upside down.”\nAmit Soussana, a 40-year-old lawyer, delivered a speech at the UN Security Council, vividly describing the horrors she experienced as a hostage of Hamas.\nAmit Soussana described the agonizing 55 days she spent as a hostage of Hamas in the Gaza Strip before the UN Security Council. The 40-year-old lawyer revealed that she was sexually assaulted and tortured while fearing for her life “every moment.”\nOn October 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas invasion, Amit was at home, sick, in the Kibbutz Kfar Aza. She heard gunshots and sent a message to her family, telling them she would try to hide in a safe place.\nHowever, Soussana was captured by Hamas members. Security cameras recorded her resistance, as she kicked and stubbornly refused to follow them. In the footage of her abduction, Soussana can be seen fighting back, while one of the terrorists carried her on his back to restrain her.\nAmit was freed after 55 days, along with other hostages.\nThe 40-year-old lawyer addressed the UN Security Council, describing the treatment she endured in Gaza.\n“I was alone, chained by the ankles with a metal chain, unable to move, and forced to beg to use the bathroom,” she said.\n“A Hamas terrorist guarding me sexually assaulted me. He forced me into the shower, following me closely with his gun pointed at me. His heavy breathing and gaze were terrifying… I didn’t have the strength to stop him,” she described.\n“I had no one to comfort me, and I had to obey the man who had just raped me most horrifically,” Soussana continued.\n“A few days later, I was moved to a new location, where other Hamas terrorists were watching me. There, they tortured me… They hung me upside down, beat me, and humiliated me. Every moment I feared for my life,” she recalled.\n“I Beg You, Don’t Turn a Blind Eye”\nAmit Soussana urged the members of the UN Security Council to end the hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon and to secure the release of all hostages.\nRegarding the hostages, she said, “Every day that passes causes them further psychological trauma and endangers their lives. Act before it’s too late.”\n“I beg you, don’t turn a blind eye to the horrific suffering of innocent civilians. It is your responsibility to protect human rights, combat terrorism, and bring the perpetrators to justice. Free the hostages and ensure no one else faces such a fate,” she said.",

Vegan Cornbread Source: Vegan Cornbread\nThis is a nice Vegan Cornbread recipe by Karielyn Tillman that is quite moist and easy to make. You probably already have all the ingredients on hand, except cornmeal, unless you use it regularly. The only thing I use it for is to make cornbread so that’s the only reason I already had some. I don’t know why, but the majority of the time I make it for breakfast (is that weird?) and rarely as a side dish to a meal like a chili. This cornbread is dense in texture and not sweet cornbread, but you could easily make it as sweet as you like just by adjusting the amount of maple syrup in the recipe.\n15.

    "text": "Dans notre Trends Talk, le député européen et vice-président des Engagés lance un appel aux négociateurs du PS à Bruxelles et espère que Bart De Wever sera à la hauteur du projet fédéral. “Parfois, la fonction fait l’homme”. Yvan Verougtraete, député européen, vice-président des Engagés et ancien CEO de Medi-Market, est l’invité de notre Trends Talk, qui passe en boucle ce week-end sur Canal Z. L’occasion d’évoquer une actualité dense, du changement de groupe de son parti au parlement européen aux difficiles négociations bruxelloises en passant par l’inquiétude sur la politique française et la perspective de voir Bart De Wever devenir Premier ministre. Face à l’extrême droite, “un projet porteur pour tous” Les élections françaises inquiètent l’Europe avec l’arrivée possible du Rassemblement National au pouvoir et le front républicain qui se met en place. Son sentiment? “Le réveil sonne, mais la réalité, c’est que cette problématique est là depuis longtemps, dit-il. Dans cinq des six pays fondateurs de l’Europe, un parti d’extrême droite est arrivée en tête aux dernières élections, que ce soit en Allemagne, en Hollande, en Flandre, en Italie ou en France. C’est le symptôme de quelque chose de plus profond et nous, en tant que responsables politiques, avons une responsabilité.” L’enjeu? “Comment réussira-t-on à construire un discours qui n’est pas toujours en opposition ou en critique, mais où on essaie d’emmener tout le monde pour l’intérêt général. On doit arrêter d’opposer une partie de la population à une autre pour essayer d’amener tout le monde vers un projet où tout le monde fait sa partie d’effort. C’est la seule façon de sortir la maison Belgique et la maison Europe vers le haut.” En Belgique, Bart De Wever est préformateur d’une coalition Arizona réunissant N-VA, CD&V, Vooruit, MR et Engagés. Peut-il être l’homme de la situation? “Parfois, la fonction fait l’homme. J’espère que Bart De Wever aura cette envie d’être à la hauteur d’un projet de société qui parle à l’ensemble des Belges et qui leur donne envie de se mouiller pour cela. C’est comme Ursula Von der Leyen à la Commission européenne, il faut juger les hommes et les femmes avec les projets qu’ils portent, pas avec le passé.” Si on ne fait pas cela, les extrêmes continueront à croître, appuie-t-il. “Le clivage à Bruxelles? C’est con!” En Région bruxelloise, les négociations sont à l’arrêt entre MR et PS. Le vice-président des Engagés, troisième parti de la future coalition, lance un appel: “On sait que la situation budgétaire à Bruxelles est encore plus fragile que dans le reste du pays. Je ne peux que faire un appel aux femmes et aux hommes politiques d’Etat du PS pour porter un projet sur Bruxelles. Nous n’avons pas la volonté d’avoir un projet qui fait mal à une partie de la population, vraiment pas.” C’est urgent, clame-t-il. “Si on ne porte pas un projet avec tous les démocrates, nous serons en danger”, insiste-t-il. Le clivage entre libéraux et socialistes? “C’est con! Ce dont on parle, c’est la façon dont on vit ensemble. Que l’on soit de droite ou de gauche, on s’en fout complètement. Il est minuit moins cinq.” “Il faut plus d’Europe” Pour le reste, Yvan Verougstraete est un homme heureux après la victoire des Engagés lors des élections du 9 juin dernier. “Certains n’y croyaient pas, mais nous avons fait le double du score auquel nous étions quand je suis arrivé, dit-il. C’est gagné le droit de jouer, mais j’ai surtout un grand sentiment de responsabilité. J’ai l’espoir de faire évoluer les choses.” Son arrivée au parlement européen a déjà été marquée par le changement, puisque les Engagés sont passés du Parti populaire européen à Renew. “Nous sommes passés des très conservateurs aux centristes, résume-t-il. Le PPE est devenu de plus en plus conservateur et mes prédécesseurs s’étaient régulièrement démarqué dans leur façon de voter. Ma conviction était qu’il fallait nous réaligner au niveau programmatique.” Au sein de Renew, dit-il, il y a plus de cohérence au niveau de l’immigration, de l’environnement ou du fonds de soutien pour les entreprises. Son credo: l’ Europe doit être un bouclier qui protège les citoyens, les entreprises, les agriculteurs, la planète. “Nous avons besoin de plus d’Europe, d’une Europe plus efficace et plus autonome.” Un entrepreneur peut mesurer mieux que quiconque la façon dont on appréhende la compétition avec le Etats-Unis ou la Chine, dit-il.

    "text": "They opened a big store in Budapest Airport in front of the duty-free shop.\nAccording to\nVilággazdaság, WHSmith, a glamorous British retail chain, opened its first shop at Budapest Airport. Based on a post by Budflyer, the new shop is located on the departure side of Budapest Airport’s Terminal 2B. It is in front of the duty-free shop.\nBased on the post, the chain offers a wide range of products from newspapers to books, electronic devices, foods, and drinks.\nAccording to Világgazdaság, WHSmith tends to open shops at airports. However, its network is more extended than the ordinary duty-free shops at the airgates.\nThe chain was founded in 1792 as a family-owned newspaper seller. Later, it became a global network and the world’s first retail chain. Last year, they celebrated their 231st anniversary.\nThey have more than 600 shops in the United Kingdom, mostly in the downtowns and main shopping streets, malls. An additional 800 shops are at airports, train stations, hospitals and near motorways.\nIt is present in Australia, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East in 32 countries. Its portfolio includes 120 airports. They pay special attention to selling local products in the different countries.\nTheir first shop at the Budapest Airport opened three weeks ago.\nIn a LinkedIn post, they wrote that their newest store is 1,200 sqm. They added that they planned to open more than 100 news shops in 2024, but did not share any details about a possible expansion in Hungary.

    "title": "DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: What I do to help halt ageing and stay healthy... From flossing twice a day to keeping my home at a chilly 15c, how to reduce 'inflammaging'",
    "text": "Not yet made your New Year’s resolutions? Then you might consider doing something about your ‘inflammage’.\nThe term, a mash-up of inflammation and age, is causing growing interest among scientists as more and more research suggests that chronic inflammation is one of the main drivers of ageing and many of the diseases that come with it.\nWhile we all have some inflammation somewhere, and increasingly so as we age, keeping levels as low as possible will pay multiple dividends. Reducing it can slow your biological clock, allowing you to live a longer and healthier life, with a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and dementia.\nI’m fascinated by inflammaging, so much so that I recently interviewed Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at Birmingham University. During the interview, which airs next Friday on Radio 4, she offered me her tips for reducing inflammaging, which I share below, alongside others I practise myself.\nAs long as you’re not frail, sick or elderly, it may be worth turning that thermostat down a couple of degrees\nSET AN ALARM TO MOVE\nOne of the best ways to reduce inflammaging is to sit less (perhaps set an alarm to remind you to get up and stroll around at least once an hour) and become more active.\nA study by the University of California in 2017 found that a single session of moderately brisk walking was enough to make a difference.\nThe researchers took blood from 47 volunteers before and after walking briskly on a treadmill for 20 minutes.\nThis was enough to significantly reduce levels of a pro-inflammatory chemical called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) which plays an important role in your immune defences, but can also trigger chronic inflammation.\nFOLLOW A ‘MIND’ DIET\nThe Mediterranean diet, which is rich in oily fish, nuts, olive oil, fruits, vegetables and legumes, is famously anti-inflammatory.\nWhy? Many of the benefits seem to come from the impact it has on our gut bacteria.\nIn a study published in the journal Gut in 2020, researchers asked more than 600 people (aged 65 plus) to stick to their normal diet or try a Mediterranean-style diet.\nRegular tooth brushing and flossing reduces the chance of developing gingivitis, inflammation of the gums, caused by a build-up of plaque between your teeth\nA year later, the people who had changed their diets not only showed signs of improved brain function, such as better memory, but they had lots more ‘good’ bacteria in their guts, the sort that produce anti-inflammatory chemicals, called short-chain fatty acids, which have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease.\nAnother more recent study, published in the journal Neurology last year, found that people who follow the so-called MIND diet (which is like the Mediterranean diet, but with a greater emphasis on eating berries and leafy green veg, such as spinach and kale) had brains that were judged to be 12 years younger than those who didn’t.\nWe don’t know exactly why, but it may be that components of the MIND diet (such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) reduce inflammation in the brain. So add another portion of greens to your meals and some berries to your yoghurt.\nLOWER THERMOSTAT\nOver recent months (with my wife Clare’s reluctant co-operation), I’ve kept the thermostats in our house at a fairly chilly 15c.\nNot only does this save money, but there is evidence that keeping the room temperature down causes your body to produce more brown fat. Unlike normal fat, brown fat burns lots of calories (to keep you warm) and it produces a chemical called maresin-2 which helps reduce chronic inflammation.\nThere is evidence that keeping the room temperature down causes your body to produce more brown fat. Unlike normal fat, brown fat burns lots of calories\nAs long as you’re not frail, sick or elderly, it may be worth turning that thermostat down a couple of degrees.\nFLOSS TWICE A DAY\nRegular tooth brushing and flossing reduces the chance of developing gingivitis, inflammation of the gums, caused by a build-up of plaque between your teeth — which not only increases your chance of losing your teeth, but is linked to chronic inflammation elsewhere.\nThat’s because bacteria in the plaque can travel in the bloodstream to other parts of the body, even to the brain.\nA study by Birmingham University in 2021 found that having advanced gum disease increased the risk of developing mental ill-health by 37 per cent, heart disease by 18 per cent and type 2 diabetes by 26 per cent.\nResearchers are working on various options to combat gingivitis, and therefore chronic inflammation, including the use of oral microbial transplants.\nThe idea, which is currently being pursued by researchers in Australia, is that you load a mouthguard with healthy bugs which you put in your mouth and which then do battle with the acid-producing ones that currently colonise your teeth.\nThat’s some way off, but in the meantime, if you don’t floss, start now.\nAnd floss first, then brush — the flossing dislodges the plaque, which the brushing then sweeps away.\nLIMIT MEALTIMES\nCutting calories leads to a longer, healthier life — or so studies show — and one of the ways that it does so is by reducing chronic inflammation.\nThat was the conclusion of a U.S. study published in the journal Aging in 2016. For this study, 220 brave volunteers were randomly allocated to either continue as normal or cut their daily calorie intake by 25 per cent for two years.\nThat’s quite an undertaking and not all of those asked to cut their calories — some, but not all, of whom were overweight — managed to stick to such a draconian diet. Those that did saw a big reduction in inflammatory markers, such as TNF (mentioned earlier).\nThe good news is the researchers don’t think you need to go that far to see benefits; cutting your daily calorie intake by 10-15 per cent, which for the average person might mean cutting out 200-300 calories (i.e. a small bar of chocolate), is enough.\nOr you might prefer following an intermittent fasting diet, such as the 5:2 diet (where you cut your calories two days a week) or time-restricted eating, where you eat within a time window.\nA recent study shows intermittent fasting reduces levels of pro-inflammatory cells called monocytes in the blood.\nBREATHE AWAY STRESS\nShort bursts of stress are manageable, but chronic stress leads to high levels of inflammation.\nSome of the best ways to reduce chronic stress include being more active and eating a healthy diet, but on top of that I’d recommend practising slow, deep breathing, which slows down your heart rate and makes you feel calmer.\nThere are lots of different ways you can do this, but my go-to breathing exercise is 4:2:4. I breathe in through my nose to a count of four, hold my breath to a count of two, then breathe out of my mouth to a count of four.\nA couple of minutes are enough to reduce my stress levels and put me to sleep, if I happen to be awake in the middle of the night.\nDaydreaming? It is good for your brain\nEver since I was a child, I have been a real daydreamer. I can be on the sofa, getting ready to empty the bins, which I have promised to do, when my mind wanders off and I start thinking about something else entirely.\nAs you can imagine, this irritates my wife. Fortunately I can now point to research which shows that, far from being a waste of time, daydreaming may be good for my mental health.\nThis is based on a recent study, published in the journal Nature, by researchers at Harvard Medical School in the U.S. They showed a group of mice black and white images, while monitoring brain activity. The mice were then left alone for a bit of down-time. While that was happening, bits of their brain would occasionally light up in distinctive patterns, as if they were mentally revisiting those black and white images.\nAt the same time, there was increased activity in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is responsible for storing memories. If the same is true of humans, then this suggests that when we are apparently doing nothing and daydreaming, our brains are in fact still hard at work, making new neural connections and existing memories stronger.\nAnd that in turn suggests it’s important for our brain health to make space in our day for more daydreams. So put your feet up, phone aside and start staring into space. Who knows what great ideas your brain will come up with?\nOne of the odd things I noticed when I went to the sales recently to buy new shoes, is that my feet seem to have got half a size bigger.\nApparently, this is common.\nAs you get older your feet can get wider because, as you age, the ligaments and tendons that support your arches lose some elasticity, so your foot can spread out. This is partly a product of wear and tear (by the time you reach my age you have probably taken around 190 million steps) and partly because any increased weight in middle age adds to the downward pressure on your feet.\nIf you have foot pain, or if your shoes are more worn on one side than the other, then it could be a sign you need arch support — and it may be time to invest in some insoles.",
