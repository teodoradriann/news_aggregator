    "text": "Dhaka, Aug 15 (EFE).- Groups of students wielding sticks attacked supporters of the Awami League, the party of disgraced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday in Dhaka. The Awami League supporters had gathered to commemorate the assassination of Bangladesh's independence hero, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, also Hasina's father. According to Bangladeshi media, the clashes occurred outside Rahman's former residence in Dhaka, where hundreds of students attacked several Awami League members. “We have been here since morning so that no one can create any violence,” said Saidul Islam Saad. The student of Sir Salimullah Medical College donned the national flag as a headband and carried a stick covered in green near Mujib Museum in Dhanmondi-32, which was burned into ashes after the fall of Hasina. Bangladesh people protest to demand justice outside of the court where Bangladeshi former law minister Anisul Huq and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's adviser Salman F Rahman are standing on trial at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Court in Dhaka, Bangladesh, 14 August 2024. EFE-EPA\\/MONIRUL ALAM “We have seen that there are attempts to foil our revolution, like our judges tried to do a few days ago. We will not allow anyone to do this,” he told EFE. He patrolled an area of Dhaka where Awami League demonstrations were expected Until this year, August 15 was observed as the National Day of Mourning, commemorating Rahman's assassination, along with most of his family members, at his official residence in 1975. Hasina was not in Bangladesh at the time. Mass events and demonstrations were typically held to mark the day. However, after she was ousted unceremoniously on August 5, under pressure from student protests, the new interim government designated August 15 as a regular calendar day without explanation. Bangladeshi former law minister Anisul Huq and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's adviser Salman F Rahman (C, wearing police helmets and vests) are escorted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Court in Dhaka, Bangladesh, 14 August 2024. EFE-EPA\\/FILE\\/MONIRUL ALAM The protests, which began peacefully on July 1, were led by university students opposed to a controversial job quota system for public employment that favored descendants of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War fighters. The demonstrations rapidly escalated and were met with severe repression by the authorities. By August 5, the situation had become untenable for Hasina, the leader of the Awami League, who had ruled uninterruptedly since 2009. According to the EFE tally, more than 400 people have died in Bangladesh since student protests against Hasina’s government began on July 1. The daughter of Bangladesh’s founder was disgraced and forced to resign and flee Dhaka on an air force plane that landed in India. EFE am-hbc-ssk",

    "text": "Will County — The Illinois State Police issued a warning to Illinois residents on Thursday to be wary of phone scammers impersonating ISP officers. According to the news release, several reports have been made in the past week from individuals who received phone calls from a person claiming to be an ISP investigator and telling the residents that their identity has been stolen. These calls are fraudulent. Illinois State Police agents do not make cold calls and will never request personal or financial information over the phone, according to the release. The state police also will not ask you to verify information in this way, according to the release. The ISP advises anyone who receives a call like this to ask for the caller’s name, badge number, and phone number then hang up. Do not provide any personal information to the caller, according to the release. You should then call your region’s investigative office, which can be found on the [ISP website](https://isp.illinois.gov/CriminalInvestigations/Zones) to verify the scam, according to the release. Anyone who has provided information to a scammer in this manner or thinks their identity may have been stolen, police recommend contacting each of the three credit bureaus — [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/), [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), and [Transunion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze) — to put a security freeze on your credit and prevent anyone from opening credit cards in your name, according to the release. You can also call the Illinois Attorney General’s Identity Theft Hotline at 1-866-999-5630, where a Consumer Advocate will help guide you through the recovery process.",

    "text": "Prescription drugs can save a person’s life, but not following the instructions for their usage can be a recipe for disaster. Nonadherence to medication regimens is alarmingly common and can have dire consequences. Not taking medications as prescribed can lead to an illness actually getting worse, increased healthcare costs, and even avoidable hospitalizations and death. For chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes, where symptoms might not be immediately visible, the temptation to skip doses can be high, but the long-term effects can be devastating.\nFollowing medication schedules and instructions for their use ensures the effectiveness of the treatment. It allows the medicine to work as intended, controlling symptoms and slowing disease progression. In cases where patients need to take antibiotics or antivirals, proper adherence is crucial to completely eradicate an infection and prevent\nantibiotic resistance.\nWhy do people misuse medications?\nOne major hurdle that keeps people from adhering to these directions is the cost of medication.\nHigh prices can discourage patients from filling their prescriptions or lead them to ration their medications. The best ways to overcome this common obstacle include:\n- Using\ngeneric medications\n- Patient assistance programs\nCo-pay cards\nYour pharmacist can be a valuable resource in finding cost-effective alternatives.\nPsychological factors, such as\nfear of side-effects or skepticism about the necessity of medication, often hinder adherence as well. Open communication with healthcare providers can demystify these concerns. Understanding the purpose and benefits of your prescription and its potential side-effects can make a significant difference.\nThere are also physical barriers, like difficulty swallowing pills or\ntraveling to the pharmacy, can impede adherence. Pharmacists can offer solutions like medication delivery services, alternative formulations, or easy-to-use packaging. Don’t hesitate to discuss these challenges with your healthcare provider.\nHow can you simplify your medication usage?\nComplicated medication regimens can be overwhelming. Using pill organizers,\nsetting alarms, or coordinating with your pharmacist for medication synchronization can help — this means trying to sync up a person’s prescriptions so they can pick up all their pills at one time.\nPharmacists can also review your medications to streamline the regimen, potentially\nreducing the number of pills you need.\nEducating yourself about your medications is empowering. Understanding what each medication does, how it helps your condition, and the consequences of nonadherence can motivate you to stick to your regimen. Ask your healthcare provider questions and make use of\nreputable online resources for additional information.\nTechnology can be a great ally in improving adherence. There are numerous apps designed to remind you to take your medication, track your doses, and even provide information about your drugs. Leveraging these tools can make managing your medication regimen less daunting.\nYou might also be interested in:\n5 Concerning Food-Drug Interactions: Pharmacist Warns Not To Mix These With Your Medications Bad medical news makes patients more likely to choose pricey drugs over generics Traveling With Prescription Drugs: 5 Essential Tips From A Pharmacist",

    "text": "Israel Pounds Central Gaza, Tousands of Palestinians Try to Escape 28 December 2023 06:40 WIB TEMPO.CO, Gaza - Israeli forces pounded central [Gaza](https://www.tempo.co/search?waktu=&kanal=&subkanal=&domain=2&q=gaza) by land, sea, and air on Wednesday, Dec. 27, and Palestinian authorities reported dozens more deaths, with the U.N. health agency saying thousands of people were trying to flee the fighting. Reflecting Israeli resolve to wipe out Hamas despite international calls for a ceasefire amid a humanitarian crisis, Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday the war would last many months. There were \"no shortcuts in dismantling a terrorist organization\", he said. Israel also signaled it could step up its response to cross-border attacks from northern neighbor Lebanon, where Hamas ally Hezbollah is based. A Gaza health ministry statement said an Israeli air strike killed 20 Palestinians on Wednesday near the Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. In central Gaza's Al-Maghazi district, five Palestinians were killed in one air strike, medics said, while to the north in Gaza City health officials said the bodies of seven Palestinians killed overnight arrived at Al Shifa Hospital. Residents in the central Gaza Strip said with nightfall, Israeli tank shelling intensified east of Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi refugee camps where tanks have been trying to force their way through. Israel's military on Wednesday reported three more soldiers killed in action in Gaza, bringing total military losses in the enclave since ground operations began on Oct. 20 to 166. The war erupted after Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages in a cross-border rampage on Oct. 7, the deadliest day in Israel's history. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded with an assault that has laid much of Hamas-ruled Gaza to waste. The Gaza health ministry said Israeli forces had killed 195 Palestinians and wounded 325 in the past 24 hours, bringing the recorded toll to 21,110 killed and 55,243 wounded in Israeli attacks in the coastal Palestinian territory since Oct. 7. Nearly all the enclave's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, many several times.",
