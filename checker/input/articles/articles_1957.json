    "title": "White Christmas adds special touch to holiday deliveries",
    "text": "Christmas Day added a special touch to this year’s delivery of meals to Churchill County’s senior citizens.\nResidents woke up to snow in the Lahontan Valley that had fallen during the morning’s early hours.\nFor Paul “Pip” Valentin, a member of the Fred Anderson American Legion Post 16 and an organizer of the Thanksgiving and Christmas meals preparation and delivery, the day’s events fell into place like a Hallmark moment.\n“We’ll be delivering 124 meals and are expecting to serve about 80 in the hall,” said Valentin, who served in the Marine Corps before coming to Fallon.\n“I didn’t expect to see a white Christmas,” he added, grinning.\nWhat surprised the 41-year-old Valentin were the number of community and military volunteers who arrived shortly after 8:30 a.m. He was surprised to see more than 60 volunteers who gave up part of their Christmas morning to help package and then deliver meals over a wide swath of western Churchill County.\n“We’re seeing more locals,” Valentin said. “We’re getting out the information in the different media, and that’s bringing them out.”\nBy having more volunteers, Valentin said they can package the meals quicker and deliver the dinners before 11 a.m. Valentin shows his enthusiasm for the volunteers and always insists they pose for a group photo.\nFor almost 30 years — give or take — the American Legion has stepped in on Thanksgiving and Christmas to help the William N. Pennington Life Center deliver meals so the regular drivers and cooks with the Meals on Wheels program may stay home with their families. Post 16 also receives donations to help with the purchasing of food.\nValentin runs the program with a certain amount of precision, and timing is key for him not only with the volunteers but also from the support of the Post 16 members. He said all services except Space Command are represented among the ranks of veterans in Post 16, many who have served during wars and others who kept watch during the Cold War.\nRetired Navy Capt. Coy Byington served for 30 years and enjoys volunteering.\n“We do Thanksgiving and this … we do a lot,” said Byington, who is also secretary of the Legion Riders. “So many people want to give back and drive out to the people who need this. It’s humbling.”\nWhile Valentin ensures the overall program is set for the holidays, Alex Riddle and his assistants are up early in the morning cooking the turkeys and hams and also preparing the side dishes.\n“Actually, we started Friday by smoking the hams,” said Riddle, who has been a volunteer for 11 years. “Then I spent two-and-a-half hours making the dressing.”\nRiddle is a U.S. Air Force veteran who moved to Fallon because his parents lived here. Soon, he became involved with the Legion’s holiday meals program.\n“I was introduced to Lance (McNeill) and Linda (Rupert),” Riddle recalled, adding they were organizing the meals for both holidays.\nRiddle signed up to become a volunteer and when McNeil and Rupert stepped away after decades of organizing and planning the delivery of meals, he and Valentin took over. McNeil, also an Air Force veteran and longtime member of Post 16, organized the holiday meals for many years with fellow veterans until he retired after almost three decades.\nAlthough cooking 22 turkeys for Meals on Wheels and the dining room patrons can be an intensive task, Riddle said it’s a labor of love with his family.\n“I enjoy giving back,” Riddle said. “It’s important for myself and son (August). He enjoys what he’s doing, and I enjoy what I’m doing.”\nUse the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.",

    "text": "It seems as if the UFC just isn't even trying...\nLook at the latest UFC poster reveal to begin promotion for UFC 316, June 7, which features two title fights headlined by UFC Bantamweight Champion Merab Dvalishvil and former champion Sean O'Malley. The co-feature sees Julianna Peña take on Kayla Harrison for Peña's Women's Bantamweight Championship.\nJust over a month away\n— UFC (@ufc)\nThe official[#UFC316]poster is HERE!\n[[@Visit_NJ]][pic.twitter.com/7I6cCKdKPh][April 29, 2025]\nWhile the fights are essential for their respective weight divisions, the poster doesn't appear to be unique. For example, the fighters could face off against one another with angry poses or have a unique background of New Jersey, the Prudential Center, or another element catered to the event itself.\nIt just looks dry. It gives off a vibe that UFC 316 is just building off its pay-per-view predecessor, failing to differentiate between the two cards. UFC pay-per-views don't feel as big as they once did, or maybe the promotion is stuck in a direction where there is nowhere to turn but where the monetary value lies.\nEither way, it's a concern. Few in the MMA community are willing to address it, whatever the reasons. The promotion shouldn't just promote the three letters. The fighters also play a hand in this. The four names at the top of the bill are marketable enough and should be treated as such.\nLastly, undeserved title shot or not, O'Malley played his card well. He waited for the opportunity to present itself and got the rematch in an era where, quite frankly, those types of fights are less common nowadays.\nEventually, one month will be removed until fight night. Whether this becomes a pattern or not remains to be seen, but there's this uneasiness around cards where five years ago, it appeared to be a non-factor.\nBy the time the fight draws closer, maybe the narrative shifts. But, for now, it seems unlikely.\nFollow MMAKnockout on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

    "title": "Exclusive: Thousands Urge CO Lawmakers to Reject Radical Trans Bill",
    "text": "Thousands of Coloradans are reaching out to state lawmakers urging them to vote against a radical transgender bill that would classify “misgendering” and “deadnaming” as forms of child abuse that would be considered in child custody disputes.\nBy Tuesday, 6,161 Coloradans sent 215,475 emails to Colorado state senators through Heritage Action for America’s Colorado Action Center, Breitbart News exclusively learned. Heritage Action started the Colorado Action Center on April 8 in response to HB25-1312 , which passed the state House on April 6 and is currently waiting to be assigned to a Senate committee.\n“Heritage Action and our army of grassroots conservatives in Colorado strongly oppose this legislation, which seeks to impose radical gender ideology on families,” Heritage Action Vice President Janae Stracke told Breitbart News in a statement. “This tidal wave of opposition against this legislation in Colorado highlights how disconnected radical Democrats are from their constituents. This bill is an open assault on parents’ rights and free speech. We urge all Colorado lawmakers to reject this legislation.”\nThe bill subscribes to the false idea that one can identify as or become a different sex than they were born as, often called “gender identity.” The bill defines “deadname” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual by their birth name rather than their chosen name.” The bill defines “misgender” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual using an honorific or pronoun that conflicts with the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.”\nAccording to the bill’s summary , the legislation would direct courts making child custody decisions and determining the best interests of a child “for purposes of parenting time” to consider “deadnaming,” “misgendering,” or threatening to publish material related to an individual’s sex change services as types of “coercive control.”\nThe bill would additionally define “deadnaming” and “misgendering” as discriminatory acts in the “Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act,” which would essentially prohibit calling sex-confused individuals by their real names or biological sex in places of public accommodation.\nThe bill would further prohibit Colorado courts from complying with orders or laws from other states mandating that a child be taken from parents or caregivers who allow them access to mutilating sex change drugs and surgeries — which transgender activists euphemistically call “gender-affirming care.”\nThe legislation would direct schools that establish policies related to “chosen names” to include all reasons why a student may choose to go by a name other than their legal name. Schools would also be barred from including rules based on “gender” in dress code policies.\nThe bill also directs public entities that require individuals to disclose their names to have options for both legal and chosen names. The public entity would be required to use a chosen name on all subsequent forms if it differs from the individual’s legal name.\nThe bill is officially called the “The Kelly Loving Act,” named after a transgender-identifying man who was killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, according to Colorado Newsline.\nDemocrats hold a trifecta in Colorado: they dominate the state House 43-22, the state Senate 23-12, and they hold the governorship with Gov. Jared Polis (D).\nDemocrats in the House denied all proposed Republican amendments to the bill and were able to use procedural rules to stymie and ultimately halt debate on the bill before passing it on a Sunday.\nDemocrats behind the bill have criticized parental rights groups concerned about the transgender bills, with one even comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan. Democrat state Rep. Yara Zokaie said, “A well-stakeholded bill does not need to be discussed with hate groups, and we don’t ask someone passing civil rights legislation to go ask the KKK their opinion.”\nAccording to Heritage Action, “ radical gender ideology activists have been working to weaponize Child Protective Services (CPS) against US parents by accusing them of ‘abuse’ if they do not affirm and recognize their child’s ‘gender identity.”‘\n“Multiple states have already passed legislation to criminalize parents through this perverse redefinition of abuse, allowing for the removal of children from the loving homes of ‘non-affirming parents,'” the organization noted.\nHeritage Action says the bill would deny parental rights, violate free speech, harm vulnerable children, and “mandate schools prioritize indoctrination over education.”\n“The ONLY time a state should ever remove a child is for actual abuse, not to impose a destructive ideology. The truth is simple. It is never abuse to raise a girl as a girl or a boy as a boy,” the organization says on its Colorado Action Center page.\n“It is imperative that all Colorado senators hear from their constituents on how this radical bill will tear apart families and harm children across Colorado,” the organization added.\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.
