    "title": "Yemenis stage massive pro-Palestine rally, back stepping up anti-Israel strikes",
    "text": "Thousands of Yemenis have staged a massive rally in solidarity with Palestinians amidst relentless Israeli ground and aerial attacks on Gaza, vowing to raise the ante and launch more strikes against Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The demonstrators took to the streets in eleven different districts of the northwestern province of Sa’ada on Friday, and took part in rallies under the motto “Victory for Gaza... Our strikes are escalating.” The participants expressed their strong support for Palestinians in Gaza and denounced Israeli atrocities in the besieged territory. “The month of Ramadan is a month of jihad before it is a month of worship. We will continue to mobilize, and stay on alert,” they said in a communiqué, expressing gratitude to resistance forces in Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq for attacks against Israeli interests in support of Palestinians. The demonstrators warned that the United States and the Israeli regime are likely to target civilians as desperately needy households would scramble to collect humanitarian assistance. They praised the honorable and humanitarian stances of some world leaders in condemnation of the vicious US-Israeli campaign against Gazans. “Praise to Yemeni Armed Forces for conducting qualitative operations and targeting Israeli-affiliated ships as well as American and British military assets in support of Gaza and in response to aggression against Yemen. “With the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, we call for a total boycott of American and Israeli goods and the companies that support them,” the statement also read. US conducts strikes in Yemen Meanwhile, the United States military has launched new strikes in Yemen against anti-ship missiles and facilities. The military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) said it conducted strikes on Thursday against four mobile anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) and one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in areas controlled by the Sana’a-based National Salvation Government. It added its forces shot down three UAVs launched toward the Gulf of Aden. The US and Britain have been carrying out strikes against Yemen after Washington and its allies offered the Tel Aviv regime their unqualified support and said that Yemeni forces bear the consequences of their attacks against Israeli-linked ships sailing to and from the occupied territories. Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine’s struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after the territory’s Palestinian resistance movements carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm. The Yemeni Armed Forces have said they won’t stop retaliatory strikes. The maritime attacks have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the world’s most important maritime trade routes. Tankers are instead adding thousands of miles to international shipping routes by sailing around the continent of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal.

    "text": "General News of Thursday, 28 December 2023\nSource:\n[www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php)\nOn December 27, 2023, the fourth Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr Michael Nutmy passed away at the age of 65.\nHaving commenced his apostolic journey at a young age, Ntumy lived a dedicated life towards the propagation of Christianity and The Church of Pentecost.\nHe was born at Dadieso in the Oti Region of Ghana and begun his professional life as a teacher in Yendi in the 1980s before becoming a deacon, and an elder of the church.\nHe was called to office as an apostle at the age of 33 and begin a journey of traversing various parts of the country and the world to spread the gospel.\nAs part of his apostolic journey, Dr Ntumy faced various trials in tribulations including wars, sicknesses and accidents that bore testament to his unflinching commitment towards the work of Ghana.\nOne of such experiences the apostle had was during the Liberian Civil of 1989 to 1997.\nApostle Nutmy who was a pastor in the Buchanan District of Liberia during the time of war became a source of motivation for several Liberians and members of the Buchanan community which was predominantly a Ghanaian community.\nIn the heat of the war, Apostle Ntumy was taken captive together with his family by the National Patriotic Front Party of Charles Taylor.\nThe apostle, his wife and children were held in the heart of the Nimba Forest where he was assaulted and poisoned.\nDespite his ordeal, a resilient Apostle Ntumy continued to be a source of encouragement for other hostages including members of his church.\nTestimonies of Apostle Ntumy’s resilience during the period was shared by members of the Buchanan District Church of Pentecost in 2022.\nElder John Baidoo, presiding elder at the now Prayer Tower Assembly, the central chapel of the Buchanan district, where Apostle Ntumy used to fellowship, testified about the impact Apostle Ntumy had on the members of the church in the district.\n“According to the elders I met, Apostle Ntumy laid his life down for most of the members here. He [Apostle Ntumy] came back three years ago and encouraged us.\n“I remember the sermon he preached: ‘When I saw him I held fast to him but I now leave him.’ That sermon brought revival to the church here in Liberia. The sermon topic is now on everyone’s lips. Our father’s presence in Buchanan has really lifted the church high.”\nA community leader amongst the fisherfolks and an elder of the church, Elder Joseph Kwame Persewaa also said: “If Apostle Ntumy was with us here now, we would have carried him up high on our shoulders. This is because spiritually he really worked. It is because of Apostle Ntumy’s works that we had confidence and courage to remain in the church. His lifestyle drew many to the church.”\nHe added: “I was present at Flamingo (the camp of no return) during the war when Apostle Ntumy prophesied that no one would die, and indeed non-members of The Church of Pentecost saw the hand and power of God and got converted.”\nThe Area Head for Buchanan Area and National Secretary of the Church in Liberia, Apostle Quie G. Toe, was full of praise for Apostle Ntumy. According to him, the successes and achievements of the Area were a result of the selfless leadership of Apostle Ntumy during his days in Liberia.\n“Before every fishing season, Apostle Ntumy would gather members of the church who are fisherfolks and pray with them. This led to the introduction of a prayer and fasting programme that helped the fisherfolks to experience bumper harvests.\n“This prayer programme has come to stay. The leadership of the church supports the Ghanaian fisherfolks to organise this prayer programme at the beginning of every fishing season,” he added.\nThroughout his apostolic career, the late Apostle Ntumy served as the Missionary of The Church of Pentecost to Liberia, Ivory Coast, France/Switzerland, from 1988-1998.\nHis tenure as chairperson of the church commenced in 1998 and ended in 2008 after two terms (ten years).\nOn his 54th birthday, Apostle Ntumy wrote an article in which talked about all the trials he had been through and how and how his faith in the lord saved him\nRead the article written by Apostle Ntumy on his 54th birthday\nAs I ponder and reflect over the course of my life so far, I realize the exceptional grace God has bestowed on me. I am not going to talk about promotion, position, power, achievements and accomplishments. I am going to share with you about troubles, trials and tears, interlaced with amazing triumphs and testimonies resulting in thanksgiving to God. The enemy of our souls forgets that his orchestrations against us rather result to the praise of God in the long run.\nIn fact, Apostle Paul said that if he had to boast, he would rather boast about his sufferings for the sake of Christ. My catalogue, however, does not come anywhere near that of Apostles.\n1. Been through four wars (Two in Northern Ghana, one each in Liberia and Ivory Coast) Charles Gangay Taylor, Leader of Liberia’s NPFL\n2. Taken hostage for 163 days in the heart of the Nimba Forest in Liberia by Charles Taylor’s NPFL rebels while serving as missionary in that country\n3. Survived three accidents— two on the road, one on the Volta Lake in Ghana. A Vessel On The Volta Lake\nSurely if my life were in my own hands, I would have lost it long ago.\n4. Survived an assassination attempt on my life while serving as the youngest-ever Chairman of The Church of Pentecost.\n5. Survived two food poisoning attempts against me\n6. Tasted hospitalization for 332 days in 2009/2010\n7. Tasting the pains and agonies of paralysis for 1,211 days (to date), moving about in an electric wheelchair.\nHowever, there is an INVISIBLE HAND THAT HOLDS, SUSTAINS and NOURISHES US. THROUGH IT ALL, being kept by THE POWER OF GOD.\nCome, beloved, praise the LORD with me.\nTHANK GOD FOR THE GIFT OF MY LIFE. He has upheld me very tenaciously through it all.Crushed, but not destroyed.\nStand with me in prayer as I go through this phase of my life, doing business for the Kingdom of God even through this “out of season” period.\nBelieve with me that the expected miracle shall take place soon for His glory.\nAll these could not have happened for nought. God is definitely up to something.\nGA/SARA",

    "title": "Israel usa palestinos como escudos humanos em | Internacional",
    "text": "Quantas vezes as autoridades israelenses justificaram o massacre de civis palestinos porque o Hamas os usa como escudos humanos? A mídia israelense relatou agora o oposto: as Forças de Defesa de Israel (IDF) usando civis palestinos como escudos humanos em áreas programadas para incursão. “É melhor que eles explodam e não os soldados”, disse um soldado israelense a um comandante das IDF. De acordo com testemunhos de soldados dados ao Haaretz, a equipe sênior das IDF está ciente dessa prática. Nas narrativas israelenses sobre os escudos humanos palestinos, o contexto é completamente eliminado. Não há menção ao fato de que Gaza está bloqueada, que as pessoas não têm como sair e que uma faixa de terra densamente povoada abriga tanto civis quanto o movimento de resistência, incluindo suas armas. O fato de Israel usar o termo “escudos humanos” para descrever as limitações do Hamas em termos de resistência em Gaza não é apenas enganoso, mas também completamente errado. Foi a violência colonial israelense que criou os escudos humanos palestinos. Depois de criar os escudos humanos palestinos, Israel encontrou uma maneira de usá-los. Primeiro, para construir sua narrativa justificando cada agressão contra Gaza. No genocídio, Israel usou os escudos humanos palestinos para salvar a vida dos soldados encarregados de matar os palestinos em Gaza. Embora a narrativa colonial de Israel considere o Hamas um grupo terrorista, é interessante observar como a mídia israelense especificou que os escudos humanos usados pelas IDF “não são suspeitos de terrorismo”. A frase em si diz muito sobre a intenção e a ação genocida de Israel em Gaza – todo palestino é um alvo, não apenas o Hamas. Segundo a mídia israelense, os civis palestinos “são detidos especificamente para serem enviados a prédios e túneis que as tropas acreditam que possam conter armadilhas”. Resumindo, as IDF explorarão qualquer caminho para matar palestinos de uma forma ou de outra, e os escudos humanos são um dano colateral conveniente para Israel, que nem precisa justificar suas atrocidades, nem mesmo o genocídio, graças à impunidade que a comunidade internacional concedeu à entidade colonial. “Nesse momento, são apenas relatos”, declarou o porta-voz do Departamento de Estado dos EUA, Vedant Patel, em resposta às perguntas dos repórteres sobre o uso de civis palestinos como escudos humanos por Israel. No entanto, a reportagem do Haaretz cita soldados israelenses confirmando o conhecimento das IDF, o que aponta para uma prática legitimada por oficiais militares israelenses. Narrativa colonial genocida Patel, no entanto, achou pertinente mencionar a propaganda israelense, que afirma que o Hamas usa a infraestrutura civil para operar, além de usar civis como escudos humanos. “Isso não é uma hipérbole”, acrescentou. Nunca houve hipérbole maior do que as narrativas coloniais de Israel, a menos que estejamos falando dos EUA, que disseminam a hipérbole como verdade. Apenas um dia antes da reportagem do Haaretz, o jornalYnet News publicou um artigo justificando o assassinato por Israel de civis que se abrigavam em escolas, culpando o Hamas por usar as instalações e, portanto, os civis como escudos humanos, citando o porta-voz das IDF, Daniel Hagari. “Israel vê as mortes de civis como uma tragédia, enquanto o Hamas as vê como uma estratégia”, afirmou Hagari. O uso de escudos humanos palestinos por Israel como parte de sua estratégia militar contradiz claramente as palavras de Hagari e a narrativa de Netanyahu. A única tragédia para Israel é a exposição de seus crimes. Embora com aliados como os EUA, que constroem suas próprias definições do que constitui verdade e hipérbole, a tragédia é rapidamente explorada para obter oportunidades de relações públicas, enquanto os civis palestinos – escudos humanos criados por Israel – entram em decadência no genocídio que o mundo aprendeu a aceitar.

    "text": "Flood-hit Brazil braces for more chaos with heavy rains to come and nearly 2 million people affected\nBy Lianne Kolirin, Michael Rios, Vasco Cotovio and Abel Alvarado, CNN\n(CNN) — People in southern Brazil, already reeling from deadly\nfloods, are bracing for more disruption as meteorologists warned of 12 straight hours of heavy rain Friday and more throughout the weekend.\nThe death toll in the floods that have ravaged parts of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul has inched up to 113, the state’s civil defense agency said, as relentless downpours sweep the region and spread to parts of neighboring Uruguay.\nOfficials are urging those who have been rescued from the floods not to return to their homes.\nIntense rain is expected to hit parts of the state’s center and east on Friday to Sunday, with some areas expecting 150 mm over that time, the national meteorology institute INMET said.\n“It is important to highlight that the predicted volumes of rain may cause new disruptions in areas already affected previously,” a statement from INMET read.\nThe storms have affected more than 1.9 million people in Brazil, and displaced hundreds of thousands, many of whom are staying in temporary shelters. Over 140 people are still missing.\nScenes of the devastating weather event have been beamed all over the world, including video footage of a horse that had to be rescued after being stranded for several days on a rooftop.\nThe animal was rescued on Thursday by members of Sao Paulo’s military. According to state run Agencia Brasil, the horse – which has been baptized on social media as Caramelo – was sedated prior to being placed on a boat as part of the rescue.\nIt had been stuck on the roof for four days surrounded by flood water in the municipality of Canoas in the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul.\nBrazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\nposted a video on X of the moment he learned of the horse’s rescue. Agencia Brasil, the sate-run news agency, has reported the rescue of more than 2,000 animals since the floods impacted Rio Grande du Sol, including dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs.\nUruguay has also been flooded by the storms. More than 1,300 people there have been displaced there, while thousands more are without electricity, the national emergency system said on Wednesday night, without specifying if there were casualties.\nThere are growing concerns that gangs may take advantage of the abandoned homes and businesses. At least 47 people have been arrested for crimes related to the catastrophic floods, 41 of whom are suspected of looting establishments. Six were allged to have committed sexual abuse in shelters, Agencia Brasil reported.\nThe record rainfall has been linked to El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that warms waters in the Pacific and tends to bring heavy rainfall to southern Brazil. Long-term global warming, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, has also exacerbated extreme weather in the region.\nRio Grande do Sul — Brazil’s southernmost state, and until recently a tranquil agricultural region — has seen repeatedly extreme weather events in recent years.\nAccording to the state government, 19 billion Brazilians reals ($3.7 billion US dollars) will be needed for rebuilding. Recent satellite mages from the state show entire neighborhoods of roads turned to rivers, a football pitch in a cavernous stadium submerged and an airport runway under water.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
