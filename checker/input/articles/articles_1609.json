    "text": "Get PolitiFact in your inbox. No, viral footage doesn’t show explosives disguised as food cans in Gaza If Your Time is short - Social media posts claim footage from Gaza shows explosives disguised as food cans, but there are no visible labels or pictures on the metal cylinders to suggest they contain food. - Experts on military strategy and the Middle East said the metal cylinders seen in photos and videos online are likely containers for M603 fuzes, which are designed to detonate landmines. Footage shows one of the cans is labeled \"fuze mine.\" - The fuzes are not designed to explode if a person opens the container. It requires 140 to 750 pounds of force to ignite the fuze and trigger an explosion. - Learn more about PolitiFact’s [fact-checking process and rating system](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/). Social media users are claiming the Israeli military has booby-trapped food cans in Gaza, where, by the United Nations’ [count,](https://twitter.com/UNRWA/status/1749708634743841023) more than 570,000 Gazans face \"catastrophic hunger\" amid the Israel-Hamas war. A Jan. 24 [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2fnDvLufbn/) shared a photo of about a dozen metal cylinders and claimed the Israeli military left \"these detonators that resemble food cans\" at schools in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza. \"Thinking they were food, displaced families opened the cans. As soon as they did, they exploded and killed them instantly,\" the post said. The Instagram post’s caption claimed that Israeli forces were \"taking advantage of the desperate situation in Gaza.\" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But these social media posts are misleading. Although there has been [significant](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dozens-deaths-reported-khan-younis-israel-deepens-ground-offensive-wes-rcna135070) [news](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227074703/survivors-recount-attack-un-facility) [coverage](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68006607) of Israel’s recent attacks on Khan Younis, we found no reports about Israel using explosives disguised as food cans in Gaza. Experts on military strategy and the Middle East reviewed the footage and told PolitiFact the munition is likely the American-made [M603 fuze](https://cat-uxo.com/explosive-hazards/fuzes/m603-fuze), which is designed to detonate landmines. Some [pro-Palestinian](https://twitter.com/Timesofgaza/status/1749959211096629512) [news](https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1749715184858358160) [outlets](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240123-explosive-food-cans-left-behind-for-gazas-civilians-by-israeli-forces/) shared the video that’s been circulating social media, but they provided no additional information to substantiate the claim. The Middle East Monitor, which shared the viral video, [used](https://www.instagram.com/middleeastmonitor/p/C2c6Lb2Juan/) English subtitles to accompany the Arabic-speaking man in the video. The man claims the metal devices are \"canned meat … found to contain a hidden danger\" that \"detonate instantly\" if opened. (We were not able to independently verify the translation.) Featured Fact-check A [longer version of the video](https://twitter.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1749758873081147567) shows at least one of the cans is labeled \"fuze mine.\" There are no visible labels or pictures on the cans that suggest they contain food. At one point in the video, the man holds up a fuze that’s been removed from its container. Diagrams of the fuze and its container [show](https://operatormanuals.tpub.com/TM-9-1345-203-12/TM-9-1345-203-120088.htm) the \"keyway,\" or opening mechanism, is on the can’s bottom. In the video, most of the cans have been turned upside-down to make it look as if the keyway is on top. The fuze container is not designed to explode upon opening. Instructions under the diagrams say to open the container and remove the fuze to attach it to a landmine. This fuze is activated when a large amount of force is applied, driving the firing pin into the detonator and causing the landmine to explode, experts said. The metal cylinder acts as a container for the fuze. The M603 fuze alone requires at least 140 pounds to activate, according to [Collective Awareness to Unexploded Ordnance](https://cat-uxo.com/explosive-hazards/fuzes/m603-fuze), an explosive hazards database. When attached to a landmine, it could take as much as 750 pounds of force to trigger an explosion. Because so much weight and pressure are required to ignite the fuze and detonate an explosive, it’s \"highly unlikely anyone was harmed or killed by opening up the container that holds this fuze,\" retired U.S. Army Lt. General Mark Schwartz told PolitiFact. \"All the fuzes also have a safety clip on them. I doubt that anyone was deliberately targeted with these fuzes,\" said Schwartz, who is also a senior fellow at Rand Corp., a nonpartisan research organization. It’s possible the fuzes are being used for purposes beyond their original design, said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. One such use could be booby-trapping buildings, which is common in urban warfare, he added. But Nadimi said he is \"a little skeptical\" that opening the cans causes deadly explosions given how these fuzes are typically activated. We rate the claim that a photo shows explosives disguised as food cans False.

A defesa dele diz que vai recorrer da decisão.\n📲 Participe do canal do g1 Sul de Minas no WhatsApp\nApesar do apresentador e do ex-funcionário serem de Muzambinho (MG) , no Sul de Minas, a ação corre pelo Tribunal de Justiça do Estado de São Paulo.

Na ocasião, o apresentador disse que o valor era incalculável. Em outras entrevistas, ele chegou a mencionar que o prejuízo ultrapassava os R$ 17 milhões.\n\"Tudo que aconteceu comigo ele queria ter também. Uma obsessão. E ele controlava o dinheiro, era muito dinheiro. Ele precisa ter esse puxão de orelha, porque me roubou demais. Foi a maior burrada que eu fiz na minha vida. É incalculável [o valor perdido], porque ele roubava todo dia e ele tinha minhas senhas todas, porque ele era o 'bãozão'. Tinha muito dinheiro nesse banco, então obedeciam a ele. Mas o ladrão, desesperado, o negócio dele, ele chegava lá 'onde eu vou roubar hoje', uma coisa assim na cabeça dele, imagina. Roubou muito\", disse o apresentador ao ge.\nO g1 entrou em contato com a defesa do apresentador Milton Neves, mas até a última atualização desta reportagem, ainda não tinha recebido retorno.\nO advogado Carlos Villalobos Cruz, que defende o ex-funcionário de Milton Neves, disse que a defesa irá recorrer e que dispõe de provas robustas que vão ajudar a reverter a decisão.\n\"A defesa de Evandro César recebeu a noticia da condenação em primeiro grau com tranquilidade, ainda há um longo caminho pela frente para se ter uma definição, e temos a certeza que reverteremos esta decisão no Tribunal de São Paulo\", disse o advogado.\nVeja mais notícias da região no g1 Sul de Minas\nMuzambinho",

Javier Rodríguez top scored for the blaugranes with six, while Cikusa returned after six weeks out.\nDifficult start\nBoth sides' attack was misfiring from the off so goals were a bit hard to come by, so much so that the score was only 5 - 4 halfway through the first half.

    "title": "Stanislaus State to host Turlock High’s annual Godinez Tournament",
    "text": "For the first time in the nearly five decades of the Frank Godinez Boys Basketball Tournament, varsity games will be played off the campus of Turlock High School.\nThe 48th edition of the popular winter tournament, sponsored by the Turlock Journal, will tip off Thursday night across town, at Stanislaus State’s Fitzpatrick Arena. The university will host each varsity game of the three-day event, which features Turlock, Oakdale, Modesto, Grace Davis, Patterson, East Union, Johansen and Golden Valley.\nOpening night of the tournament gets underway at 4 p.m. when Patterson takes on Modesto. At 5:30, Johansen and East Union will clash. The Bulldogs, under new head coach Rick Fetter, will begin their quest for their third tournament title in four years, and 13th overall, when they face Oakdale at 7. The night concludes with Davis and Golden Valley tipping off at 8:30.\nThe tournament, which usually takes place the second week of December, has also been pushed up a week after timing conflicts came about when the 2024-23 schedule was being constructed last year. Despite the move in dates, there remained a scheduling conflict, as the usual venue, Bulldog Arena, had already been booked to host the annual Bulldog Classic wrestling tournament, an event that requires mats to be put in place a full day before action on Saturday. Luckily, the Stanislaus State volleyball and basketball teams are all on the road this week, and the folks there were quick to welcome Turlock High with open arms.\nEven with the varsity games moving to North Turlock, there remained a conflict with the junior varsity competitions. While those games will remain at Marchant Gymnasium for Thursday, Friday’s slate will take place at nearby Dutcher Middle School to avoid the heavy traffic and closed closures leading up to the annual Turlock Christmas Parade. Games will return to THS on Saturday.\nFetter, a longtime hoops coach for the program’s junior varsity and freshman levels, took the reins for Doug Cornfoot this offseason. Cornfoot, one of the most celebrated coaches in school history, stepped away after last season following a one-year comeback from retirement.\nThe tournament is named after another local legend, Frank Godinez, a longtime sports reporter for the Journal. He was nicknamed Mr. Bulldog, as he was known to be on the sidelines for most Turlock High’s sporting events.",

Thankfully, several parishes in the New Orleans metro area have a quick system designed to pick up the discarded trees and use them to fight coastal erosion.\nChristmas tree recycling programs have existed for decades in the area. After residents return their trees to their parish, experts determine where to place them to help protect the coast while minimizing tree-induced hazards.\nBy sifting sediment flowing in the water, the tree's roots help collect enough of it to form new land, once the sediment settles and the roots firm up.\nHow it started The initiative began in the 1980s amid a national movement to recycle Christmas trees. Local government leaders, as well as LSU scientists and environmental groups such as the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL), sought to repurpose old firs that would have otherwise gone to landfills.\nAn LSU graduate student from the Netherlands, Roelef Boumans, first introduced the idea , which had long been used in his home country.\nThe eventual success of the program led more than a dozen coastal parishes to adopt their own tree recycling efforts.\nThis will be the 35th year that Jefferson Parish will collect firs. Michelle Gonzales, Jefferson Parish's director of ecosystems and coastal management, said the project has since helped establish over 1,300 feet of fences that help absorb and soften waves, thus reducing erosion.\nNow, over 2,000 feet of shoreline is protected from daily wave action by the fences. Gonzales said the program has directly impacted more than 20 acres in the Barataria Basin.\nFor the past five years, the program has collected between 2,000 to 4,000 trees each year, according to Gonzales.\nOrleans Parish has had its own Christmas tree recycling program for the last 26 years, contributing to the restoration of 200 football fields-worth of marsh in the Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge in New Orleans East.\nCrews move bundles of Christmas trees in the Madere Marsh in the Bayou Sauvage Urban National Refuge on Wednesday, March 20, 2024. The City's Office of Resilience and Sustainability, in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, dropped about 8,000 trees which was a 100% increase from last year. Over the 26 years of this program, recycled trees have restored approximately 200 football fields worth of marsh. (Photo by Chris Granger, The Times-Picayune)\n(Photo by Chris Granger The Times-Picayune) In addition to storm and erosion protection, the trees also create habitat for crabs, crawfish, birds, shrimp and fish.\n\"I feel like so often when we talk about coastal restoration, you just hear the statistics and all you can do is be aware and be bummed out,\" Cheryn Robles, environmental administrator for the city's Office of Resilience and Sustainability, said. \"This is an opportunity to be engaged.\"\nThis year, Orleans Parish is aiming to collect 8,000 trees, the same figure as last year. Hitting the mark could be more difficult, however, because most of the Christmas trees come to the area from North Carolina, where damage from Hurricane Helene led to fewer trees and cost increases.\n\"It was just harder to get trees this year,\" Robles said.\nFor the first time this year, the parish began collecting trees on Dec. 26. Usually, recycling begins on Jan. 6, the day of Epiphany. Residents can call 311 to get curbside tree pickup for the first 400 trees. In collaborating with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Louisiana Army National Guard, Robles said the program is aiming to drop the trees sometime in March, around Earth Day.\nIn a related project not open to the public, CRCL recycled wreaths last year in partnership with the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which had placed 1,300 wreaths at Chalmette National Cemetery.\nThe coastal group then worked with students at the University of New Orleans to string the wreaths together and anchor them to the floor of Quarantine Bay in Plaquemines Parish, to encourage sediment build up. CRCL plans to continue the project this season, with over 3,000 wreaths.\nOther places around the country also use Christmas trees for various restoration initiatives. In Wisconsin, the firs are placed in lakes to improve fish habitats. Ohio also uses trees to halt erosion by dropping them in stream banks. Some areas, like Massachusetts, use the trees to build beach dunes.\nHow to recycle your tree Orleans Parish\nFrom Dec. 26 through Jan. 3, you can call 311 to request curbside pickup.\nFor scheduled pickup, place your trees on the curb by 5 a.m. Jan. 6 through Jan. 10.\nYou can also drop off your trees from Dec. 26 to Jan. 5 at 2930 Lafitte Ave. or Bodenger Park, 3400 Kansas St.\nResidents in the French Quarter and Downtown Development District should place their trees on the curb by 4 a.m. on Jan. 9.\nJefferson Parish\nYou can either place your tree on the curb outside your home on Jan. 8, or bring it to a drop-off site.\nCurb pick-up will occur Jan. 9 through Jan. 11.\nIf you want to cherish your tree for a bit longer, you can drop it off at 400 David Drive, Metairie or 6440 Lapalco Boulevard, Marrero from Jan. 4 through Jan. 14.\nThe Jefferson Parish Christmas tree recycling drop event will take place on January 25 from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. behind Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte. Volunteers under 18 can sign up here and adults can sign up here .\nSt. Tammany Parish\nSt. Tammany typically runs a tree-recycling program. Details for this year have not yet been released. Stay tuned for updates.\nSt. Charles Parish\nStarting Dec. 30, residents can drop off their trees at the Ormond Sandbag Location (next to 1901 Ormond Blvd in Destrehan), and The West Bank Bridge Park in Luling until Jan. 16.\nTrees can also be placed curbside from Jan. 13 to Jan. 17 for collection.\nTo recycle your tree, make sure it meets the following guidelines:\nNo flocked trees No artificial trees No painted trees No lights, garland, tinsel, ornaments, tree stands or plastic bags Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "text": "A dog that was found emaciated in B.C.’s North Okanagan last summer has found a forever home, the BC SPCA announced. The nine-year-old Labrador retriever mix was taken to a shelter in Shuswap by a Good Samaritan after he wandered out of the woods outside Enderby, B.C. in July. Named Fish by staff, the dog was “skin and bones and covered in sores,” when he arrived at the BC SPCA centre. He needed a supervised feeding program to help him gain weight and muscle mass, as well as dental surgery to remove infected and broken teeth. “Fortunately, the sores on his body healed once he had a soft bed to sleep on,” the charity wrote. After months of treatment, the malnourished dog fully recovered and went up for adoption. Fish’s new family took him home just before the holidays, according to the BC SPCA. His forever home is with Tony and Darlene, a retired couple who were looking for a rescue they could “shower with love” after they lost their dog Abby in July. “We read a story about Fish and we just knew he was our dog,” said Tony in a Friday media release. “We couldn’t be happier for Fish,” said Isabell Diederichs, assistant manager of the BC SPCA’s Shuswap shelter, in the release. “He is the most loving dog who deserves the best home and he has that now.” After they picked Fish up at the shelter, Tony said “we opened the door to our truck he jumped right in. He didn’t hesitate at all.” The couple has taken in a number of rescues over the years, but no dog settled in as quickly as Fish, Darlene said. “Considering everything he has been through, his trust in people is just amazing,” she said. “He is just so loving and big-hearted.” Fish has found a new friend in Ballou, the couple’s rescue cat. The pair now enjoy taking naps together on the couch. Fish and Ballou together on the couch. (BC SPCA) “They got along right from the get-go,” Darlene said. “Fish was so calm and gentle around him.” “Ballou was missing Abby terribly. He loves to spend time with Fish and is excited to see him when he gets back from his walks,” Tony added. Speaking of walks, Fish is very enthusiastic about them. “When he knows it is time for a walk Fish will pick up your boots or shoes for you to help speed up the process or he will carry his leash,” Tony said. “We have an amazing dog beach right by the lake that he loves. He has been so good with other dogs and just loves meeting new people,” he continued. After being found starving and wounded, Fish now gets all the love and attention he needs. “We just want to make Fish the happiest dog we can,” said Darlene. “We are retired, so there is always someone at home with him. Whatever he needs, he gets.” “He rescued me,” Tony added. Shopping Trends The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "text": "Previsão de chuva forte: escolas da rede pública do Rio de Janeiro fecham\nRecomendação da secretaria municipal de Educação é de que a rede privada também não funcione\nNão haverá aulas nesta sexta-feira (22) nas mais de 1,5 mil escolas públicas municipais do Rio de Janeiro. Seguindo o decreto de ponto facultativo do prefeito Eduardo Paes,\npor conta da possibilidade de chuva forte, o secretário municipal de Educação, Renan Ferreirinha, suspendeu as atividades para os 660 mil alunos da rede.\nEm vídeo postado nas redes sociais, Ferreirinha lembrou, ainda, que em caso de necessidade, as escolas vão, como de costume, servir de pontos de apoio em ações da prefeitura.\nO secretário ainda recomentou que as escolas privadas fizessem o mesmo. A ideia é evitar deslocamentos na cidade por conta da previsão do tempo.\nNa tarde desta quinta-feira (21), Paes decretou ponto facultativo nas repartições públicas municipais para esta sexta. De acordo com o Sistema Alerta Rio, entre o fim da noite desta quinta-feira e a tarde de sábado (23), a aproximação e a passagem de uma frente fria vão deixar o tempo instável na capital. A possibilidade é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte, acompanhada de raios e rajadas de vento moderado a forte (até 75,9 km/h). A chuva poderá chegar a 200mm em 24 horas. A média em março, segundo a série histórica, é de 124,7mm.\nO ponto facultativo contempla servidores de áreas administrativas não essenciais, para evitar deslocamento de pessoas na cidade. Serviços essenciais, no entanto, seguem funcionando 24h.\nO prefeito também orientou a iniciativa privada para que não haja expediente nesta sexta. “O ideal é que as empresas que não tenham serviços essenciais também parem. É ideal termos a cidade esvaziada. Vamos observar como será esta madrugada, mas é provável que a chuva deva começar ao longo da tarde. E nesse momento seria importante termos pouco movimento na cidade”, alertou Paes.\nEsquema de resposta à chuva\nMais cedo, a Prefeitura do Rio apresentou as medidas a serem adotadas e o efetivo que será utilizado pelo município em ações de resposta, em função da previsão de elevado acumulado de chuva para a cidade nos próximos dias. Ao todo, 9,3 mil servidores estarão envolvidos na operação, incluindo equipes da Comlurb, secretarias de Conservação e de Ordem Pública, Centro de Operações Rio, Rio Águas, Defesa Civil, Sistema Alerta Rio, Fundação Georio, Guarda Municipal e CET-Rio.",
