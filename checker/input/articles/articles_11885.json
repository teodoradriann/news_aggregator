    "title": "More monster waves will collide with the California coast after injuring onlookers and causing serious flooding",
    "text": "More monster waves will collide with the California coast after injuring onlookers and causing serious flooding\nCNN, KCAL, KCBS\nBy Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford, Mary Gilbert and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n(CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are\ndriving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast.\nMonstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets.\nA brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it.\n“Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned.\nSea levels have risen along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperature climbs and melts glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making coastal flooding events worse and will continue to do so in the future.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening.\nThe first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding.\nOne of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "水能够检测 X 射线？这一发现颠覆了常规 X 射线探测器主要依赖于硅、锗或碲化镉等固态半导体材料的传统认知。\n近期，浙江大学林时胜教授团队成功研制出全球首款水基 X 射线探测器，并展现出优异的 X 射线检测性能。其核心创新在于采用了创新的垂直层状结构设计——由石墨烯、极性液体（如水）和硅片组成的“三明治”结构，实现了自驱动的高灵敏度 X 射线检测。\n在性能表现方面，该探测器在自驱动模式下展现出卓越的特性：暗电流极低（不超过 1.8 纳安每平方厘米），对 X 射线剂量率具有良好的线性响应，灵敏度达到 104.5 微库仑每戈瑞每平方厘米，响应时间仅 19 毫秒。\n图丨林时胜（来源：林时胜）\n研究团队还通过引入高原子序数元素（如碘）进一步优化了探测器性能，将灵敏度提升至 224 微库仑每戈瑞每平方厘米。这一数值不仅超越了大多数自驱动 X 射线探测器的性能水平，甚至接近高性能钙钛矿自驱动探测器的标准。\n（来源：Advanced Functional Materials）\n这项技术的突破性意义体现在多个方面：\n首先，在应用领域，它在医疗成像（特别是低剂量 X 射线检测）、光刻机以及 X 射线剂量标定等方面展现出巨大潜力；其次，在产业化方面，该器件低于现有市场产品成本和制造工艺简单的特点；更重要的是，这项研究不仅突破了固态材料的物理限制，还为开发更高灵敏度、更低功耗的新一代探测器奠定了重要的科学基础。\n“现在，我们已经掌握了 X 射线设施、水基体系优化和表面处理等核心技术。这是该方向的第一篇论文，已经超越了大部分相同结构探测器的水平，证明了其良好的发展前景。”林时胜对 DeepTech 表示。\n近日，相关论文以《高性能水基 X 射线探测器》（High Performance Water Based X-Ray Detector）为题发表在 Advanced Functional Materials [1]。浙江大学博士生杨仁余是第一作者，林时胜教授是想法的提出者，并担任通讯作者。\n图丨相关论文（来源：Advanced Functional Materials）\n这项研究是林时胜带领团队长期科研探索的延续性成果。追溯其研究历程可以发现，早在 2022 年，他就创新性地提出了“水的半导体二极管”这一新型光电探测器概念。这一研究起源于林时胜对半导体间发电器件的基础研究，特别是动态二极管的原创发明 [2]。后续在液态光电探测器方向持续发展，并与包括诺贝尔物理学奖得主康斯坦丁·诺沃肖洛夫（Konstantin Novoselov）在内的教授合作了基于水凝胶的紫外光探测器 [3] 。\n此外，在研究过程中，团队将这一物理原理进一步拓展至水在半导体间流动发电的新体系。随后，推动到光子运动与液体水分子运动作用，通过光激发调控水分子（两个氢原子和一个氧原子）的定向翻转运动，成功实现了液体光电电信号的产生。\n（来源：Advanced Functional Materials）\n最初，这种脉冲电信号仅在可见光频段被观测到。考虑到光刻机在 EUV 和软 X 射线波段的应用前景广阔，研究团队决定将其拓展到紫外、X 射线和中子射线探测领域，尤其是深紫外波段，并最终成功实现了 X 射线的有效探测。\n林时胜解释说道：“从最初的可见光探测研究开始，我们就一直在探索将其拓展至 X 射线探测的可能性。这不仅是由于 X 射线在光刻机、天文学等领域的重大应用价值，更因为这是一个极具挑战性的跨学科研究领域。”\n（来源：Advanced Functional Materials）\n与传统半导体 X 射线探测器相比，水基探测器展现出显著的技术优势。传统探测器通常需要配备复杂的冷却系统（如液氮冷却装置），这不仅增加了设备的整体重量，也大幅提高了制造成本。而水基探测器完全无需冷却系统，极大简化了设备结构设计。\n在材料性能方面，传统多晶碲锌镉材料不仅合成工艺复杂，而且内部缺陷较多，容易产生极化等不稳定现象。相比之下，水基探测器采用成熟的硅材料体系，有效规避了这些材料稳定性问题。值得注意的是，当前大多数高性能探测器都依赖于昂贵的特殊材料或复杂的制备工艺，而水基探测器在保持高探测灵敏度的同时，显著降低了制造成本。\n探测器的核心工作原理基于极性液体分子在 X 射线照射下的动态极化过程。当 X 射线激发硅表面产生光生载流子时，水分子在界面处发生翻转极化，氢端朝向硅表面，氧端朝向石墨烯电极。\n这一过程破坏了原有的电荷平衡，促使外电路产生电流。关闭 X 射线后，水分子迅速恢复到无序状态，形成可重复观测的瞬态极化电流、稳态极化电流和去极化电流。这种独特的工作机制不仅实现了高效的 X 射线-电能转换，还避免了传统探测器中因载流子复合导致的性能衰减问题，展现出优异的稳定性。\n（来源：Advanced Functional Materials）\n在研究推进过程中，团队面临了诸多技术挑战。首要难题是水作为 X 射线探测介质的可行性问题——此前从未有研究尝试用水探测 X 射线，水的电子传输理论不确定性等。\n其次，合适的 X 射线测试设备的选择也耗费了大量精力。团队曾咨询多家设备厂商，并获得通策集团捐赠的 X 射线设备，后来在浙江大学极端光学仪器国家重点实验室的支持下，使用软 X 射线设备进行测试，虽然取得一定进展但仍未达到预期。经过深入讨论，团队创新性地提出向水中添加 X 射线吸收微纳粒子的解决方案。\n林时胜指出，水的独特优势之一在于其优异的溶解性，这与传统半导体材料难以兼容其他物质的特性形成鲜明对比。通过系统筛选多种材料，团队最终在化学改性方面取得突破性进展。\n基于详尽的文献调研和实验验证，研究团队确信当前水基 X 射线探测器的性能已与 Nature Science 等顶级期刊报道的钙钛矿 X 射线探测器最高水平接近。\n谈及该技术的产业化发展，林时胜表示：“任何技术的工业化进程都必然经历市场应用驱动的迭代升级过程，就像苹果手机从初代到 iPhone13 的演进历程。”\n他坚信这项技术具备产业化潜力，但也同时指出, 在技术升级过程中需要统筹考虑工程人才、资金投入、技术配套等关键要素的系统性匹配。该团队期待未来与更多的跨领域学者开展合作，突破传统的思维局限，共同推动探测器技术的创新发展。\n参考资料：\n1.R.

    "text": "Williams College Receives Anonymous $25M Gift to Support Projects Staff Reports 06:00PM / Thursday, April 18, 2024Print Story | Email Story WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. — Williams College has received a $25 million gift commitment in support of three major initiatives currently underway on campus: constructing a new museum building, developing a comprehensive plan for athletics and wellbeing facilities, and endowing the All-Grant financial aid program. The donors, who wish to remain anonymous, say the gift reflects their desire to not only support Williams but also President Maud S. Mandel's strategic vision and plan for the college. \"This remarkably generous commitment sustains our momentum for WCMA, will be a catalyst for financial aid, and is foundational for athletics and wellness. It will allow us to build upon areas of excellence that have long defined the college,\" Mandel said. \"I could not be more appreciative of this extraordinary investment in Williams.\" Of the donors' total gift, $10 million will help fund the first freestanding, purpose-built home for the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), a primary teaching resource for the college across all disciplines and home to more than 15,000 works. Each year, roughly 30 academic departments teach with WCMA's collection in as many as 130 different courses. The new building, designed by the internationally recognized firm SO-IL and slated to open in 2027, will provide dedicated areas for teaching and learning, greater access to the collection and space for everything from formal programs to impromptu gatherings. The college plans to fund at least $100 million of the total project cost with gifts. Another $10 million will support planning for and early investments in a comprehensive approach to renewing the college's athletics and wellbeing facilities. The unexpected closure of Towne Field House in the fall of 2023 accelerated the college's work to examine its aging infrastructure. Towne's programming will temporarily move to a new Multipurpose Recreation Center, slated to open in late 2025 near the site of the current outdoor tennis courts, paving the way for a new athletics and wellbeing complex in the future. The remaining $5 million of the gift commitment will help endow the college's All-Grant financial aid program, now in its second year. The program replaces traditional loans and work-study requirements with equivalent grants that don't have to be repaid. More than 50 percent of students currently receive financial aid. The $77.5 million financial aid budget already extends beyond tuition, room and board to cover expenses such as health insurance, unexpected medical bills, textbooks and art supplies, study abroad, and travel to and from campus. All-Grant adds another $6.75 million annually. Williams hopes to increase the amount of financial aid spending covered by the endowment beyond its current level of about 50 percent.

    "text": "New York (CNN) — American households want the biggest bang for their buck right now when they pull their wallets out to shop. That doesn’t mean they want something cheap all the time. They’ve been paying more for goods and services for a while because of [higher inflation](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html) that stubbornly stuck around. What’s also occurred concurrently is that higher interest rates have made it more expensive for shoppers to borrow money – on credit cards for example – for buying things or paying off necessities such as monthly bills. But even as consumers push through these pressures, they’re still shopping, and seeking deals. Bargain retailers like Walmart and Costco have benefitted, as shown by the retailing industry’s recent slew of first-quarter earnings releases. People are also reading… Discount behemoth [Walmart](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/wmt)’s business was buzzing as thrifty shoppers flocked to its big-box stores last quarter to bag deals on groceries and everyday necessities like shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels and toilet paper. Sales at its stores open at least a year increased 3.8% in the quarter from the same time last year. Other discount purveyors such as Ollie’s Bargain Outlet and Costco also enjoyed a jump in their same-store sales in their latest quarter. At the same time, there’s a different kind of deal-seeking happening, too. Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, a bunch of stores that are known for more expensive products that aren’t exactly necessities are also seeing a boom. Which means that Americans are still spending, but selectively, and that “value shopping” means different things to different people. It doesn’t necessarily mean cheap. “Value is a watchword for consumers,” said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director with GlobalData Retail, in an interview with CNN. “But value is not just about finding the lowest price. It’s about finding products that people really want and that they will get use out of,” Saunders said. “So gone are the random impulse buys of things that will be placed at the back of the closet and forgotten, and in are the more considered purchases.” To his point, shoppers are willing to dig deeper if they they feel like they’re getting quality products that are on trend, feel good, and last for a long time, even if it means spending a little bit more. [Abercrombie & Fitch](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/anf) enjoyed a stunning 21% surge in its same-store sales last quarter because it hit the fashion trends that its core younger shoppers are craving, such as low-rise baggy jeans and well-tailored wide-legged pants, and then some. The retailer, which also owns the Gen Z-favored Hollister brand, is pushing ahead for the first time into newer lucrative areas such as [wedding items like bridal dresses and even pajamas](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/business/fast-fashion-wedding-dresses/index.html) as it strives to become a one-stop destination for its clientele. [Williams-Sonoma](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/wsm), which sells pricey kitchenware such as Le Creuset dutch ovens for a few hundred dollars each and $4,000 automatic espresso machines, also reported improving sales in the first quarter. (It also owns upscale home goods and furniture brands Pottery Barn and West Elm.) “Our recent launches with partners, such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer, have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends,” Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma CEO, told analysts during the company’s most recent earnings call. [Gap Inc](https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/gps)., whose brands include Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, pulled out same-store sales increases for the first time in years in its most recent quarter across all four brands under new CEO Richard Dickson, who came on board last August. Dickson’s focus has been on getting back to the basics with quality products. This strategy included its newest summer linen clothing collection and surprise marketing moves involving celebrity collaborations. A [Gap white shirt dress](https://people.com/anne-hathaway-gap-gown-available-to-buy-8654727) for Anne Hathaway appeared to thrill shoppers. The dress became a viral moment on social media for the retailer, which Gap quickly seized upon by releasing a limited [pre-order for the dress](https://people.com/anne-hathaway-gap-gown-available-to-buy-8654727) to its shoppers priced at $158. It sold out in under three hours. Shoppers are homing in not just on prices but on the benefits that they hope to receive from products for the price that they’re paying for it, Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer told CNN. “Consumers are thinking long and hard about where and when they are spending,” Stambor said. “A sizable segment of them are focused on value, however, that doesn’t directly correlate to a low price. Shoppers are willing to spend if they see value in an on-trend, well-made dress from Abercrombie – or a healthy salad from Sweetgreen.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "U.S. woman believed to be held hostage by Hamas, Judy Weinstein Haggai, was actually killed in Oct. 7 attack, spokesperson says - CBS News",
    "text": "A 70-year-old woman with U.S. citizenship who was thought to have been taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7 was actually killed during the initial attack, according to a statement released Thursday by the kibbutz she was taken from.\nJudy Weinstein Haggai, who was an Israeli, American and Canadian national, came under fire in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her husband, Gadi Haggai, 72, a dual U.S.-Israeli national. Both were believed to have been taken hostage, but last week Israeli officials said they had confirmed Gadi Haggai's death.\nAccording to a spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz , where the couple lived, Judy Weinstein Haggai was also \"fatally wounded\" by Hamas gunmen in the Oct. 7 attack.\nBoth bodies are still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, the spokesperson said.\nThe statement said Weinstein Haggai was a mother of four and grandmother of seven who taught English to children with special needs, and described her as a poet and entrepreneur who \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nIn a statement released by the White House, President Biden said:\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week's news that Judy's beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judy and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts. I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.\"\nWeinstein Haggai had family ties to the New York area. Gov. Kathy Hochul tweeted : \"Heartbroken to learn that Judith Weinstein was killed during the October 7 attack. My heart is with her family abroad and those still here in New York. May her memory be a blessing and may the many hostages still in captivity be brought home safely.\"\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the news \"devastating.\" \"I'm grieving and praying for them. We must keep working to bring the hostages home. We cannot wait,\" he wrote .\nThe couple's daughter, Iris, told CBS News in late November that she had seen video evidence that her father was killed, and said at that time that she had had no updates about her mother.\n\"The hostages that were released didn't see her. They didn't hear about her,\" she told CBS News, as dozens of hostages were released as part of a temporary cease-fire . \"I don't have any proof of life for my mom. Nothing.\"\nIsrael has said about 250 people were taken hostage by Hamas and other militants who rampaged through communities in southern Israel, near the Gaza border, on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas and responded with a major military assault on Gaza, which remains ongoing and has killed at least 21,000 people in the territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nA temporary cease-fire in November led to the release of 105 hostages — Israelis as well as some foreigners — in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. According to Israeli authorities, about 129 people are still being held hostage in Gaza.\nIsrael & Hamas At War More Gaza family tries to protect newborn quadruplets amid destruction of war U.S. woman believed to be Hamas hostage was killed on Oct. 7, kibbutz says Israel warns about Lebanon border hostilities as war in Gaza rages on Israel pounds central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive Israel bombs central Gaza as Netanyahu maintains hard line on Hamas More In: Hamas Israel Gaza Strip Kerry Breen Kerry Breen is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.
