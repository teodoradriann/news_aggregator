    "text": "PERRY, Ga. — Hurricanes [Milton and Helene](/article/weather/hurricane/when-does-hurricane-season-end/67-1f565f73-b273-4dd5-918a-0bae66008e75) swept through the southeast over these past few weeks, destroying large parts of Central Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. Despite that, the Georgia National Fair went on as planned, and many people flocked to the fair for a distraction from the storms. Terry Mullinex lives in Augusta, Georgia and was hit by Helene. He says his home lost power and still has no internet, and he was worried that Milton would hit him, as well. “Most people have power back, [and] about 30% have internet but it's coming,\" he said. \"It's gonna take a while to get it back completely clean.\" Until then, he says he wants to enjoy the fair. He says he and his family head to Perry for the fair every year. “Well yeah we always come meet our grandkids down there,\" he said. \"We said, 'We are not gonna let the storm stop us,' so here we are.\" Another thing that's braved the weather to attend the fair - Katy Conley's cow exhibit. “I would say they've had a change in their behavior,\" Conley said. \"They tend to want to stay inside. I had to fight her into the pasture.\" Conley shows her cows at the fair and says she is glad to be able to show them this year, despite the weather difficulties. “I absolutely love showing [the cows],\" she said. \"I don’t know what I would do if I had lost my animal or didn't have a way to come show - showing is my passion.\" Conley she heard some people can't show because of the storms, and some of her friends' cows have been fighting and acting strange since the hurricanes started. Maggie Lane is the marketing director for the Georgia National Fairgrounds. She says the hurricanes impacted their operations in the leadup to the fair's opening. “We went from hunkering down during Hurricane Helene, expecting the worse, to coming out okay luckily,\" Lane said. \"But not many of our neighbors did. Just 40 miles to the east, we had really severe affects from Hurricane Helene. I think initially that has affected attendance.\" Now, she says with Hurricane Milton, people have been heading to the fair to get away and not have to think about the effects on their homes.",

    "text": "TEHRAN — Thousands massed on Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike.\nThe crowd in Tehran's central Imam Hossein square chanted \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America\".\nIsrael has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi's killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Hamas-Israel conflict since early October.\nIranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday killed Moussavi, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arms, the Quds Force, near the Syrian capital Damascus.\nThe Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier on Thursday met with Moussavi's family and led a prayer over the slain general's body before it was taken to the square.\nMany of the mourners were waving yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent”, a reference to Israel.\nThe head of the Guards, Hossein Salami, hailed Moussavi as “one of the most experienced and effective IRGC commanders in the Axis of Resistance”, Tehran-aligned armed groups in the Middle East.\nSalami praised Moussavi for his key role after a former Quds Force commander, the revered Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Soleimani had run the Guards’ foreign operations for more than a decade.\nIRGC spokesman Ramezan Sharif warned on Wednesday that “our response to Moussavi’s assassination will be a combination of direct action as well as [from]others led by the Axis of Resistance”.\nSharif charged that Israel’s killing of the general “was likely due to its failures” when Palestinian Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on October 7.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry informed the Senate Committee on Interior that foolproof arrangements had been made for the security of the Chinese engineers and other staff working in Pakistan. Senator Faisal Saleem Rehman chaired the committee meeting here. Senator Irfan Siddiqui said many things of law and order were related to the provinces and a new wave of terrorism was rising every day. “Every day we are hearing the news of martyrdom of our soldiers. Whether any operation will take place or not,” he asked. Briefing the committee, Interior Minister Moshin Naqvi said the security of the Chinese engineers and other staff was being taken care of and foolproof security arrangements had been made. He said the current wave of terrorism was due to the agreements made by the previous government with the Taliban, which led to the release of terrorists from prisons. He said after their release, the terrorists started forming groups of 15 to 20 people for terrorist activities. He said there was misconception about the Azm-e-Istehkam in the media. He said maintaining law and order was the responsibility of the provinces and other institutions will go and return after doing targeted operations, but peace was the responsibility of the provinces. “FC conducts border security and targeted operations. The targeted operations and border security fall under the Ministry of Interior,” he said. Naqvi said the interior ministry will give a follow-up on the murder cases of journalists. He mentioned the ongoing operations in Punjab and Sindh with the support of Rangers, and significant improvements in the security on the main Super Highway. He told the committee that President Zardari visited Sukkur and held a meeting in which it the local police officers would be removed from the division. The standing committee asked the FC officials for a report on a terrorist attack on Senator Hidayatullah. He told the committee that coordination among the departments concerned had been organized in a better manner. Senator Umar Farooq said protection of the life of the common citizen should be the first priority of the government. On his request, the committee sought a report on the Balochistan coal mines from the Balochistan government. The committee chairman appreciated the recent actions of anti-smuggling agencies at Torkham border to prevent smuggling. Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the Chinese were not tourists and not just part-time visitors but they were playing a very important role in Pakistan’s economy, national security, development and prosperity. “We have to fulfill our responsibilities to ensure the safety of the Chinese,” he said. Senator Naseema Ehsan informed the committee about threats to her and her family’s lives and said there was an attack on her house after which her children could not go anywhere. She further told the committee that she had contacted the IG Police but he said he was busy attending a meeting. In the committee meeting, Senator Saifullah Abro said the senators had started talking about their own security and asked what they had to do about the others’ security. Court issue a notice to the attorney general and advocate general Islamabad and indicated to hear the case on a daily... CCP team also provided an overview of the Act with a particular focus on the significance of packaging and labelling... CM Sarfraz Bugti briefs President Zardari on the overall situation of the province and the ongoing development projects Several people including women were injured in police action and several leaders of Baloch Yekjehti Committee and... Court directed IGP to ensure posting of newly recruited law graduate police officers in police stations and... They argue it would promote smoking habits among children in African countries",

Le premier cas concernait une personne étrangère ayant voyagé en République démocratique du Congo (RDC). Par la suite, quatre autres cas sont apparus parmi les contacts proches de cette personne.\nAvec notre correspondante à Pékin, Clea Broadhurst\nLes autorités sanitaires chinoises ont annoncé ce jeudi 9 janvier avoir détecté le variant clade Ib du virus mpox sur le territoire chinois, alors que l'infection virale se propage dans davantage de pays.
