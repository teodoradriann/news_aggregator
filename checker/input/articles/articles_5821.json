    "text": "Firenze, calci e pugni allo stomaco e alla testa: anziano pestato a sangue in Santa Croce L'aggressione in pieno giorno scatenata da un rimprovero. Calci e pugni allo stomaco, sulla schiena e infine sulla testa. La vittima è un pensionato di 70 anni Un rimprovero ha scatenato una violenza inaudita. Un pensionato di 70 anni è stato brutalmente aggredito e picchiato da un uomo. È accaduto alle 13 di mercoledì in pieno centro storico, nella zona di Santa Croce. Le immagini di un video – diffuso da La Nazione – mostrano una violenza contro l’anziano che subito dopo è stato portato al pronto soccorso di Santa Maria Nuova: i medici gli hanno diagnosticato 21 giorni di prognosi. Le immagini mostrano l’anziano che si trova in via de’ Bentaccordi e si sta camminando in direzione Santa Croce. Ha solo il tempo di fare pochi passi perché di fronte si trova un uomo che lo aggredisce: l’anziano prova a scappare ma l’altro lo insegue fino a quando, una volta raggiunto, lo scaglia contro contro il muro. A questo punto l’anziano finisce per terra ma la furia dell’aggressione non si ferma. Calci e pugni allo stomaco, sulla schiena e infine sulla testa. La vittima si mette a urlare e a quel punto alcuni passanti vanno a vedere che cosa sia successo. Subito dopo chiamano il 118 mentre l’aggressore scappa e l’anziano rimane a terra. I medici arrivano poco dopo assieme ai carabinieri del nucleo radiomobile. L’uomo è stato aggredito perché aveva rimproverato una persona perché non teneva il suo cane al guinzaglio e poteva essere pericoloso: una volta avuta la notizia e assicuratosi che la vittima è in carico dei medici, i militari tornano in strada. La diffusione delle immagini – che non sono state riprese dalle telecamere di sorveglianza del Comune – spostano però la storia in un terreno ben diverso. Quello della violenza pura. I carabinieri devono ancora raccogliere il racconto della vittima, che è fondamentale per attivare una vera e propria inchiesta visto il nuovo codice di procedura penale modificato dall’ex ministra Cartabia. Nel frattempo i carabinieri stanno cercando nelle telecamere di sorveglianza di Palazzo Vecchio qualsiasi indizio che possa portare all’identificazione dell’aggressore che per due giorni è riuscito a sfuggire alle forze dell’ordine. L’uomo adesso rischia – sempre se ci sarà la querela della vittima – una denuncia per lesioni personali aggravate. In queste ore i militari stanno anche cercando di ricostruire l’esatta via di fuga dell’aggressore per riuscire eventualmente a risalire alla sua macchina. E soprattutto alla targa del mezzo che potrebbe «tradire» l’aggressore, dando l’identità del suo proprietario.

    "text": "Survivor 48 recap: Star gets a bad rap Nobody in the game wants to work with the fan favorite, leading to a hype new jam. By Dalton Ross Dalton Ross California Dreams was better than Saved by the Bell. There, I said it. EW's editorial guidelines Published on April 30, 2025 09:30PM EDT Comments Jeff Probst, Eva Erickson, Mary Zheng, Star Toomey, Mitch Guerra, Kyle Fraser, Kamilla Karthigesu, Joe Hunter, and Shauhin Davari on 'Survivor 48'. Credit: CBS A history of Survivor, in rap form.Jeff Probst continues to let his freak flag fly.Unfortunately, the entire cast of Survivor 48 knows how to spell. Yo, I’m watchin’ Survivor, this show is kinda dopeThey got immunity contests where you pull a big ropeStrong four straight chillin’, no one working with MaryJeff Probst talkin’ waffles can’t help but be a bit scaryEat food on reward and you’re sure to get sickWear a blindfold in a challenge, you might hurt your… Okay, okay, that’s enough of that. Clearly, I am no Star Toomey. Star, who just became the first Survivor contestant to bust out not one but two raps in the same episode. It goes without saying that “My Enemies Are Plottin’” will go down as a modern classic of the art form. The beats were solid, the flow was exquisite, the bars were on point. She could have stopped there, content to obtain immediate one-hit wonder status. But the rhymes just kept coming! Star’s encore performance of “It’s Time to Go” during her final words may be seen by some as a mere afterthought, but to construct such a fully realized vision of post-Tribal catharsis while still in the throes of grief is a remarkable artistic achievement that should not be overlooked. Watching Star serve up this delicious hip-hop dish on a platter at Tribal Council also could not help but act as Exhibit A as to why we need more Ponderosa content back in our lives. Because Ponderosa is where all of the greatest Survivor raps in history have come to glorious life. Let’s take a look. Of course, the ultimate Survivor Ponderosa musical act of all time would be Heroes vs. Villains jury band the Dragonz, comprised of Coach, JT, and Courtney — a group so legendary that the band inspired a super exhaustive oral history. Part of their posthumously released The Ponderosa EP was a song titled simply, “Dragonz Rap.” This absolute banger can be found at the 2:35 mark of the video below. Dragonz producer and music impresario Norwood Cheek attempted to catch lightning in a bottle once again the following year when he enlisted Survivor: Nicaragua jury members Andrea Boehlke, Matt Elrod, and David Murphy to form a band titled Chucho, who recorded the unreleased hip-hop curiosity “Monkey in a Cage,” which Entertainment Weekly unearthed from the vaults as part of the Dragonz oral history. Just how curious is it? Take a listen… Of course, the true pièce de résistance when it comes to Survivor raps was delivered by none other than The Noble One (a.k.a. Chris Noble), with the bop to end all bops, simply titled “Ponderosa.” This is the dope Survivor rap by which all other Survivor raps will be judged, complete with a hilarious, pimped-out music video to boot. Crank that bass and enjoy… So where do Star’s two songs rank alongside these classics of the albeit extremely obscure and narrow genre that only I care about? That is for you to decide as we ponder yet another missed opportunity by not having a live finale this season where Star could pull a Sekou Bunch and bring us to commercial with a fresh new jam. Damn you, after-show!!!! Okay, let’s make our way through the rest of Survivor 48 episode 10 before I start dropping more bars. A reverse psych-out The editors got me. Those sneaky bastards did it again. I was flat-out convinced Joe or Eva were going home this week. Knew it in my bones. Because they made it so obvious! Just look at these quotes from the episode: • “We really hold a lot of power because I’ve built up an artillery of weapons to protect me and my allies. I have the hidden immunity idol, I have a Safety Without Power, and with all that we can get to the final four and everybody else can’t really do anything about it.” — Eva, after the Tribal Council that voted out David. • “We got eight days left in the game and I never felt so solid with my alliance.” —Joe, after bringing in Mitch and Kamilla to increase the strong four to bigger six. • “I don’t picture anyone trying to make a move on me or my core people. I feel unconcerned with the next few votes.” — Eva, during the reward chicken and waffles feast. I’m sorry, but those are the quotes of people that are ready and waiting to be blindsided to the bejeezus. How many times over 48 seasons have we heard quotes like that only to see the mouthers of such Survivor sacrilege be blindsided later that very same day? Of course, as the card-carrying president of the #Joeva fan club, this meant that I was fairly distraught throughout the entire episode, causing an immediate shortage of Milwaukee’s Best in the northern New Jersey region due to panicked overconsumption. In the past, including such quotes in the edit was a surefire tip-off, but now they’re a great reverse red hearing. It’s like a giant Survivor double negative where people saying how safe they are actually means they could, for once, be safe. Ah… but for how long? But who cares about any of that when Mailman Mitch is getting chased by a rabid pit bull?!? Not only did Mailman Mitch wipe out while getting chased by a chained-up pit bull, but he completely reenacted the wipe out while writhing around in sand for his tribe’s amusement. Perhaps they needed to be amused after being kept up all day and night by Mitch’s snoring. As the certified lightest sleeper on the planet who has seriously considered having plugs surgically and permanently inserted into my ear canals, I can sympathize with Star’s plight in being kept awake by Mitch’s snoring. I just wish she had written a dope-ass rap about it. 'Survivor 48' players share their most embarrassing stories ever (exclusive) David Kinne says girlfriend left him after he did not win 'Survivor 48' Snake in the sand Don’t look now, but we have an old-fashioned reward challenge this week! And it was a Survivor classic that I kinda feel we maybe first saw in Millennials vs. Gen X but am definitely too lazy and full of Milwaukee’s Best to go and fact-check. It was that one where players’ arms and legs are bound like they are in a BDSM dungeon as part of some late night Skinemax docu-series. They then have to slither like a snake through the sand, only this time instead of pushing a buoy with their face, they had to use their mouth to drag the buoy — which, frankly, did not seem quite as funny as the previous incarnation. Clearly recognizing that the tweaked challenge was not as humiliating or embarrassing as pushing a ball across a dune with your schnoz, Jeff Probst more than made up for it by peer-pressuring the contestants into some sort of weird fried chicken and waffles chant that gained momentum faster that Mailman Mitch being chased by a chained-up pit bull. Can I tell you how into Probst’s weird era I am? Had I not been out for last week’s recap, I would have laid down 1,000 words easy on Jeff randomly breaking into an English accent. WHY IS HE DOING THAT?!?!? I have no idea, but I absolutely love it. Remember when he momentarily turned into a gargoyle at Tribal Council? Or that time he morphed into what I guess was William Shakespeare??? The dude is like, “F--- it. I’m 48 seasons in. Where my Falstaff at?” Jeff Probst on 'Survivor 48'. CBS I’m so about all of this. The fried chicken and waffles chant was so bizarre and so wonderful that I honestly kind of wanted it turn into the Sideshow Bob rake gag and just keep going and going and going until it was time for next week’s preview… and the preview was them still doing the fried chicken and waffles chant!!! What would have been the absolute best is if they were all doing the chicken and waffles chant, and then players all slowly stopped doing it after it had gone on for a while… BUT JEFF JUST KEPT GOING! So then Kamilla and Joe and Mitch just sort of all looked awkwardly at each other and were like “I guess we should start chanting again?” And then the players once again all restarted chanting “fried chicken and waffles” because they didn’t know what else to do and could not handle how uncomfortable it was to watch their all-of-a-sudden crazy host sit there and chant about food that he wasn’t even going to eat! Anyway, they eventually (and unfortunately) stopped and Kyle won the challenge, enabling him to pick three other people to jump on what appeared to be an excessively crewed speedboat to another island where they could engage in various whipped cream shenanigans. His picks of Eva, Kamilla, and Shauhin were specifically designed to get Mitch, Star, and Mary “as pissed off as possible” so they would side with Kamilla and take out Joe. What Kyle did here is pretty fascinating in that he seemingly went against his best interests in helping Kamilla try to take out Joe, who not only acts a huge shield for Kyle, but also actively wants to bring Kyle to the final four. But Kyle recognized that Kamilla also needed some agency in this game, and he was willing to aid her in taking out his ally to prove his allegiance, while doing so from the shadows so as not to upset Eva and Shauhin. Sneaky. And also the move of a good ally. Kyle Fraser on 'Survivor 48'. Robert Voets/CBS Rack ‘em and stack ‘em Ah, yes, the classic spell-immunity-backwards-in-balancing-blocks challenge in which I always secretly hope someone misspells immunity because there would be nothing funnier in the whole world then someone stacking all eight blocks, only to for it to read immutiny. Also, if producers truly want to scratch my classic reality TV itch, they would change the word that needs to be spelled from immunity to technotronic, but that is neither here nor there. Anyway, everyone knows the only way to win this challenge is to talk incessantly to your blocks and order them to “not be a butt.” Apparently, Kyle’s blocks were being butts, and honestly, the less said about butts the better after reading this. However, after enduring drops, slow motion flies, exaggerated heartbeat sound effects, and a few make-out sessions with his pieces, Joe finally emerged victorious, beating all seven competitors. Yes, seven, because even though the Hostmaster General offered rice to last the rest of the game if three people sat out of the challenge, he could not find a single taker. Big props to the Survivor 48 cast for giving up that grub for a shot at immunity. I think the decision was probably helped by the fact that this is a challenge that everyone probably thought they had legitimate chance to win. There are some competitions where people show up and know they have no chance. Not this one. Doesn’t matter how tall or small you are. Balance is not as huge an issue on this one as it is on some others. Strength is pretty irrelevant. This contest is the great equalizer, which probably played a part in nobody sitting out. Anyway, congrats to Joe on winning his third individual immunity, no doubt sending Club Condo into an absolute frenzy. Shauhin Davari, Mary Zheng, Kamilla Karthigesu, Star Toomey, Joe Hunter, Eva Erickson, Mitch Guerra, and Kyle Fraser on 'Survivor 48'. CBS Star of the show Can we get a ruling on if the Revolution counts as an official Survivor 48 alliance name? I’m not sure if that was an actual alliance name, and I’m not even sure there was ever an actual alliance! Kamilla, Star, and Mary talked about forming a new fearsome foursome with Mitch to go to rocks at the next Tribal Council and take out Joe, but Mitch was not buying what Star was selling. And once Mitch was out — even telling Shauhin that Star was after him after Joe won immunity — then Kamilla folded faster than you can say Sega Dreamcast. Which meant the vote was between Star and Mary. That’s a tough choice. On one hand, Star is endlessly entertaining and has the rapping skills of a young Mike Boogie, while Mary, on the other hand, has no problem calling out her just-voted-out ride-or-die as paranoid at Tribal Council, even though he was not paranoid at all and was actually 100 percent correct about the forces coming after them. Decisions, decisions! In the end, Star got the boot, which is a shame. It’s really odd because Star did not get a huge edit this season at all, but every time she was shown or did get a confessional interview, it was super fun and funny. And believe it or not, this was a calm version of Star we got on TV. When we spoke the day before the game began, the woman was bouncing off the proverbial walls. Easily the most zestful player I had ever met by a long shot, Star’s vibrancy took a dip once she hit the island due to the obvious reasons (lack of food and sleep), but she still managed to be the cast’s resident Energizer Bunny.

No one in the game trusted Star, most likely because her game — like her personality — was a bit all over the place. But for viewers, she was an absolute delight… even when she wasn’t rapping. “Hit me where it hurts, uncle JP,” she said while presenting her torch for snuffing. “Hit me where it hurts.” This one hurt viewers as well. So let’s help with that hurt by offering you some much-needed medicine. We’ve got the entire Survivor 48 cast sharing their most embarrassing moments ever, and if you are not reading that immediately, then what are you even doing with your life? We’ll also have an exclusive deleted scene showing Star before the immunity challenge, and Jeff Probst will be weighing in on the episode as well. Plus, we’ll have our exit interview the rapping dynamo, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Alright, it’s your turn to weigh in on the episode in the comments below, or just opine on the majesty of the Chris Noble music video.

    "text": "(Adnkronos) -\nParlare di dimissioni del Papa? “Tormenti inutili”. Il cardinale Angelo Bagnasco, già presidente della Conferenza episcopale italiana, all’Adnkronos definisce in questi termini il dibattito che si è rinfocolato attorno alle dimissioni del Pontefice da quando Francesco è ricoverato al Gemelli.\nA rompere il tabù era stato nei giorni scorsi il cardinale Gianfranco Ravasi, ex ‘ministro’ della Cultura, che non ha escluso l’eventualità. Oggi interviene anche il cardinale Bagnasco che concorda con le parole espresse dal segretario di Stato vaticano Pietro Parolin.\n\"Ho sentito la dichiarazione del cardinale Parolin che si tiene giustamente al largo da certe questioni, proprio diciamo tormenti inutili\". Bagnasco poi con gli auguri al Pontefice unisce “anche la preghiera personale per il suo ristabilimento al più presto e il ritorno alle attività normali e consuete”.\nUn dibattito inopportuno dunque quello sulle dimissioni? \"Inopportuno sì, non c’è nessun motivo per trattare queste cose, non mi pare proprio\".",

    "text": "New Delhi: As winter climbs to its peak, keeping babies protected from the cold is of utmost importance. Here are few practical tips ensuring the well-being of newborns amidst chilled weather Winter-appropriate clothes The baby won't stay warm or safe with more layers of clothing, but they will with the appropriate winter wardrobe. The ideal baby clothing is made of natural, baby-safe fibres that breathe well and are soft. You can purchase wool clothes to cover your baby's hands, feet, and head. The most effective ways to keep the body warm are mittens, socks, and caps because bare skin causes the body to lose heat and become cold. Change the diapers quickly once you notice heaviness as if your tiny tot remains wet for longer, so chances are the baby may catch a cold. Massage the baby with essential oils Massaging the baby with warm oil containing necessary ingredients, such as almonds, coconuts, sesame, etc. will improve circulation in the baby's body and build stronger bones for growth. After the massage, wait 1-3 hours before giving your baby a good bath. Oil massage keeps your baby's body warm and allows them to sleep peacefully. Boost your baby’s immunity with a proper diet Breastfeeding provides the baby with the mother's skin-to-skin contact to keep the baby warm, and breast milk is full of all the nutrients and antibodies needed to support healthy growth and development. A nutrient-rich diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables can be given to your baby if they are older than six months. Watch symptoms of illness and take precautions Even with careful preparation and cautious care for newborns, infections such as colds, congestion, or fevers can still occur. Hence, you need to be on the lookout for symptoms of illness and get medical advice if necessary. Remain vigilant, and don't wait for severe symptoms to appear in your child. Usually, the first indications of a problem are irritability and fatigue. Give your baby timely vaccinations. Keep yourself and the environment safe and healthy If you are a breastfeeding mother, you should eat a healthy diet. During the winter, when temperatures drop to 3–4 degrees, room heaters can be used to keep the temperature stable. But since humidifiers lower air moisture levels, which can otherwise cause breathing issues, you should also use them with room heaters. Remember, as your child grows, his/her needs will also change; therefore, you should adjust your lifestyle and winter care routine accordingly. (With inputs from IANS)",

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Bucks Free Press",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.

    "text": "Expert lista os piores alimentos para comer antes de dormir\nNutricionista revela alguns alimentos que podem ser prejudiciais e devem ser evitados antes de dormir; confira\natualizado\nCompartilhar notícia\nDiversos fatores podem atrapalhar a noite de sono, principalmente com a intensa rotina de trabalho, estresse e exposição excessiva às telas. Para evitar dormir mal, as pessoas recorrem a diversas alternativas, como\nhigiene do sono e suplementos — mas raramente cogitam que a alimentação é o que pode estar prejudicando o descanso.\nAssim como existem alimentos que incentivam o sono, outros devem ser evitados para que a meta de sete a oito horas diária seja alcançada. A coluna Claudia Meireles, então, procurou a nutricionista Danielle Luz Gonçalves, que revela os itens para “passar longe” antes de correr para o edredom.\nConfira!\nAlimentos para evitar antes de dormir\nDe acordo com Danielle Gonçalves, certas refeições não devem ser consumidas no jantar porque podem impactar o sistema digestivo, os níveis de energia e também o estado de relaxamento do corpo.\nRicos em gorduras e proteínas\nA especialista recomenda que as pessoas evitem alimentos ricos em gorduras e proteínas, como carnes vermelhas, frituras e queijos gordurosos, porque eles exigem mais tempo e energia para serem digeridos.\n“Podem causar desconforto abdominal, indigestão e azia, especialmente quando o corpo está em posição horizontal, como durante o sono”, alerta.\nAçucarados\nDanielle Luz Gonçalves também indica evitar opções com muito açúcar, como sobremesas e refrigerantes, que elevam rapidamente os níveis de glicose no sangue . “Essa elevação é seguida por uma queda abrupta, que pode causar despertares noturnos e dificultar o retorno ao sono profundo”, diz.\nRefeições muito condimentadas\nAlimentos condimentados, especialmente pratos picantes, podem causar desconfortos. A especialista frisa que eles costumam induzir irritações no estômago e esôfago, que causa azia e prejudica o adormecer.\n“E podem aumentar a temperatura corporal, o que também interfere na capacidade de dormir tranquilamente”, ressalta.\nCafeína\nA\ncafeína, presente em chocolates, em chás e no café, é um dos principais motivos de tanta gente passar a noite em claro. “A cafeína bloqueia a adenosina, um neurotransmissor que promove o sono, dificultando o adormecer. Além disso, a cafeína pode permanecer no sistema por várias horas, prejudicando a profundidade do sono”, salienta Danielle.\nÁlcool\nBebidas alcoólicas podem até parecer favoráveis ao sono, mas isso não passa de uma primeira impressão. Segundo a especialista, o álcool interfere sobretudo na fase REM, o que provoca um descanso superficial e menos reparador.\nFique de olho!\nApesar desses ingredientes terem propriedades que podem diminuir a qualidade do sono, Danielle Gonçalves afirma que a resposta do corpo a certos alimentos pode variar significativamente de uma pessoa para outra devido à individualidade biológica.\n“Enquanto algumas pessoas podem consumir cafeína à noite sem problemas, outras podem sentir os efeitos mesmo com pequenas quantidades, resultando em dificuldade para dormir”, diz ela.\n“Fatores como genética, metabolismo, estado de saúde geral e até mesmo o padrão alimentar ao longo do dia influenciam como o corpo de uma pessoa específica processa alimentos e, consequentemente, como esses alimentos afetam o sono”, enfatiza.\nComo as orientações gerais podem não se aplicar a todos, a expert destaca a importância das pessoas experimentarem e observarem as reações do próprio organismo para ajustarem a dieta e não terem uma noite ruim.\nPara saber mais, siga o\n perfil de Vida&Estilo no Instagram.",

    "title": "Outrage Over Dubai's Chocolate Kunafa Pani Puri: A Fusion Dish Gone Wrong | - The Times of India",
    "text": "Dubai’s food scene is no stranger to bold experiments, but a recent fusion dish at Bhukkad Cafe, based in Al Karama has left food lovers both bewildered and outraged. The viral dish—‘Chocolate Kunafa Pani Puri’—has’ triggered a heated debate on social media, with many demanding its removal from the menu.\nA fusion no one asked for?\nBhukkad Cafe's newest fusion combines two traditional dishes from each other's cooking cultures—Kunafa, which is a Middle Eastern treat of chocolate layered with cheese and syrup-soaked crispy layers of dough, and India's popular street food popular, Pani Puri – a crispy hollow poori that is typically filled with boiled chickpeas or chana and some spicy & tangy chutneys along with spicy water.\nHowever, in this controversial reinvention, the Pani Puri shells are stuffed with Kataifi (shredded phyllo dough) and pistachio cream, then drenched in chocolate syrup—a combination that has left food purists horrified.\nThe viral moment\nA Dubai-based food vlogger named Zehra A Syed recently posted a video featuring the hollow Puris filled with Kunafa dessert served on a toy cart with glasses of chocolate syrup, which has amassed thousands of views. Her verdict? The presentation was impressive, but the taste didn't live up to expectations. She admitted she wouldn't try it again, echoing the sentiments of many netizens.\nSocial media backlash\nIt is an online storm of negativity where people are saying that the nation's favourite old dishes are “being experimented with” in the name of fusion.\nPeople took sarcastic jibes on this video and one person commented that she’ll send her ‘enemies’ there, while another commented that “we need to stop with the Kunafa pistachio trend please.”\nAnother person taking a sarcastic jibe at the video said that “I am waiting when this trend will get dip into Kunafa Nihari & muddle itself in Kunafa biryani.”\nFusion or culinary offence?\nThis creation joins a growing trend of experimental fusion foods that blur culinary boundaries. While food innovation is generally welcomed, some traditions seem best left untouched. Many critics argue that the success of a dish shouldn't be measured by its viral appeal but by its ability to honour the heritage and authenticity of the flavours it represents.\nThe debate rages on, but one thing is for sure, not all fusion dishes are crowd-pleasers, and Chocolate Kunafa Pani Puri might just be one fusion too far!\n(Thumb image courtesy: Instagram/@z.blogs & Canva)\nAbout the Author TOI Lifestyle Desk The TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
