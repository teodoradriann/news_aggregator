    "text": "Celebrities\nTom Cruise ‘Appears to Have Had Some Volume Restoration’ Amid Plastic Surgery Rumors, Expert Says\nThere's a huge buzz surrounding\nTom Cruise's dramatic Super Bowl intro - but for all the wrong reasons. Online critics say the 63-year-old Top Gun: Maverick star's face looked \"puffy\" and \"stretched,\" sparking plastic surgery rumors. (The actor has never admitted to getting work done.) \"He appears to have had some volume restoration, likely through fat grafting or possibly using expertly placed dermal fillers,\" Dr. Renata Khelemsky, a double board-certified and fellowship-trained facial cosmetic surgeon, who has not treated the actor, exclusively tells In Touch.\n\"In Tom's case, this appears to have made a\nsignificant change in the midface, cheeks and under-eye areas, restoring a fuller look. The results are striking because we're seeing the contrast between his newly volumized features and older photos where volume loss was more pronounced.\" If Tom did get some pre-Super Bowl tweaks, the work was good overall, says Dr. Khelemsky: \"He appears refreshed and more youthful, reflecting a strategic, staged approach to facial rejuvenation.\"\nCopyright 2025 Us Weekly.

    "text": "Following a three-year competition, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) announced Vancouver-based Ecoation Innovative Solutions Inc. (Ecoation) as the winner of the Deep Space Food Challenge . As the Canadian grand prize winner, Ecoation will receive $380,000 for their CANGrow Modular Indoor Food Production System, designed to operate in remote environments like outer space and northern regions. CANGrow uses an innovative approach to producing a diverse range of fresh foods, including strawberries, cherry tomatoes, mycelial meat substitute, etc. With the potential to generate more than 700 kg of nutrient-dense food annually, the system maximizes its produce and high-quality protein sources with minimal resources. The Deep Space Food Challenge, launched in 2021 in collaboration with NASA and Privy Council Office’s Impact Canada , aimed to develop innovative ways of producing food for astronauts on space missions to the Moon and Mars. Members of the jury highlighted the quality of the projects submitted. These solutions could make a real difference in our capacity to sustain long-duration missions in space, while addressing current food production issues in isolated communities on Earth. “As humanity ventures further into our solar system, new challenges, such as access to nutritious food, will arise for astronauts along their journey. With the Deep Space Food Challenge, Canadian innovators had the opportunity to develop innovative food production solutions to help space explorers that could also apply to people living in remote and harsh environments on Earth. Advances in space science and technology can unlock promising solutions to improve food security on our planet,” said The Honorable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry",

    "text": "The visit of Hena Shahab, the widow of late gangster-turned-politician and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Shahabuddin, to Lalu Prasad Yadav has stirred a political debate in Bihar.Hena called on Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday evening at the residence of an MLC in Patna.While the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan sources predicted a political rendezvous between the Lalu and Shahabuddin families, the BJP accused the RJD supremo of trying to bolster the “nexus of villains” responsible for the perils faced by people of Bihar during the 15 years of 'jungle raj'.Shahabuddin, who was known as a bahubali (strongman) and considered close to party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, died of Covid-19 in May 2021 while serving a life sentence for murder in Delhi’s Tihar Jail.However, the relationship between Shahabuddin’s family and the RJD has recently soured. Earlier, attempts by the Lalu family to persuade Hena had failed. The Wednesday meetings assume significance, as they hint at mending these relations.The BJP has criticised the RJD, citing the ‘criminal background’ of the late MP. BJP spokesperson Kuntal Krishna claimed that Lalu Yadav was busy assembling the \"villains of jungle raj\", adding said the veteran RJD leader was attempting to reunite all such “evildoers” after losing prominence in Bihar politics.The JD(U), also noting that Hena had no cases registered against her, accused the RJD of trying to bring together the components of the fifteen years of Lalu-Rabri Raj in Bihar.JD(U) national secretary Rajiv Ranjan said, “This is something not unforeseen in RJD’s politics so far. No one can deny the fact that Hena Shahab has no cases filed against her, but people know who is around her.”“The decision to mend fences with Shahabuddin’s family will bring no political gain for the Mahagathbandhan, and the RJD in particular,” Ranjan added.He also stated that voters in Siwan elected a JD(U) candidate to the Lok Sabha during the last general elections, and no one would settle for a Bihar that existed prior to 2005.However, RJD spokespersons remained tight-lipped about the meeting. Hena Shahab contested the recent Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate after the RJD chose to field Awadh Bihari Chaudhary from Siwan.Prior to the Lok Sabha polls, Tejashwi Yadav was anticipated to meet Hena during his Jan Viswas Yatra. However, the meeting could not be convened as Hena had left Siwan for her village for \"personal reasons\" when the Yatra arrived at the constituency.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Aug 9, 2024Trending Reel",
