    "title": "Delhi Health Minister assesses Covid preparedness amid rising JN.1 variant cases across country",
    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 28 : In view of rising cases of Covid, including of new variant JN.1, across the country, Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Thursday visited the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital to assess its preparedness. The hospital has reserved 20 beds for Covid patients, but there hasn't been a confirmed case there yet. \"Separate help desks have been set up for Covid patients, along with a dedicated testing centre in the hospital. Immediate treatment will be given upon confirmation of Covid. Directives have been issued to maintain readiness in all Delhi government hospitals,\" said an official. The official said that the city government has mobilised all arrangements in Delhi government hospitals to strengthen everything, ensuring readiness to handle any situation. Talking to reporters, Bharadwaj said that a separate ward has been set up for Covid patients, with approximately 20 beds and all necessary facilities. \"Currently, the entire ward is empty as there hasn't been any confirmed case of a Covid patient in the hospital yet. However, continuous screening of patients with Covid-related symptoms is ongoing. As soon as any Covid-related patient is confirmed, they will be immediately admitted and treatment will commence. Almost all preparations in the hospital have been completed, and further preparations will be made as per the evolving situation,\" he said. Bharadwaj said that as soon as any patient with symptoms like Covid or flu is confirmed, an RT-PCR test will immediately be conducted and for this, a separate testing centre has been arranged in the hospital. On patients affected by the new variant, he said that there has been confirmation of only one patient with the JN.1 so far. He mentioned that this patient was admitted to a nearby hospital after confirmation. \"The patient has now recovered and returned home. Although this variant is considered less dangerous than the previous ones, it's crucial not to be negligent,\" he said. Bharadwaj advised caution not only by the hospital administration but also to Delhi residents, urging them to stay vigilant to prevent any risk of contracting the disease. He said that directives have been issued to all hospitals under the Delhi government to maintain all preparations for dealing with Covid-19. \"Although there isn't any alarming situation in Delhi at the moment, as a precautionary measure, instructions have been given to all hospitals to ensure readiness. This is to handle any emergencies more effectively in the future. We hope that there won't be any such issues, but it's essential for us to remain vigilant and cautious. In this context, directives have been given to all hospitals to maintain their preparedness,\" the minister said. --IANS ssh/vd",

    "text": "Authors Accuse Meta of Using Unauthorized Books for AI Training\n[Riley Hayes](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79656)Updated: 01-09-2025 04:07 PM\nLegal Battles Over Copyright and AI Training\nIn recent months, a group of authors has stepped forward with serious allegations against Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). They claim that the tech company knowingly utilized pirated versions of their copyrighted books to train its artificial intelligence systems. This significant accusation has been underscored by assertions from high-profile authors, including Ta-Nehisi Coates and comedian Sarah Silverman, who are now embroiled in a court case against the tech giant.\nDetails of the Allegations Against Meta\nThe authors have filed court documents that suggest the approval for this practice came directly from Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. These allegations have come to light following a filing in federal court that revealed internal communications which suggest that Meta was aware of the pirated nature of the materials they were using.\nThe Nature of the AI Training Dataset\nThe core of the issue lies in Meta's use of a training dataset known as LibGen, which reportedly contains millions of pirated works. The authors are asserting that this dataset, distributed through peer-to-peer torrents, was essential for the training of Meta's large language model, Llama.\nFurthermore, during the discovery process, the plaintiffs were able to obtain internal communications that flag concerns among Meta's AI executive team regarding the legitimacy of the LibGen dataset. Despite these concerns, they allege Zuckerberg authorized its usage.\nThe Authors' Legal Journey\nThe legal actions against Meta have been ongoing since 2023, with the authors initially contending that their books were misappropriated for AI training without their permission. This situation encapsulates a broader trend within the tech industry, where many creators, including artists and other authors, have raised alarms about the unauthorized use of their works in AI development.\nFair Use Defense and its Implications\nIn response to these claims, defenders of AI technology have often resorted to the fair use doctrine, arguing that their methods fall under accepted practices for copyright material usage. However, this case instigates a critical dialogue on the limitations of fair use in the age of digital media and AI.\nCourt Proceedings and Future Developments\nRecently, the authors requested permission from the court to file an updated complaint based on emerging evidence. The aim is to bolster their infringement claims and consider adding a new computer fraud allegation alongside reviving their copyright management information (CMI) concerns.\nDuring a hearing, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria expressed his intention to allow the authors to revise their complaint but remained cautious about the viability of their new claims regarding fraud and CMI violations. This skepticism reflects just how nuanced and challenging legal interpretations are when it comes to the intersection of technology and copyright law.\nThe Bigger Picture: Navigating AI Ethics and Copyright\nThis ongoing saga between Meta and the authors raises essential questions about the ethical boundaries of AI training datasets and the respect for intellectual property. As technology continues to advance, the urgency for clear regulations regarding AI usage of copyrighted materials becomes more apparent. The outcomes of such legal disputes will undoubtedly shape the landscape of AI development and its relationship with creative industries.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the main allegations against Meta Platforms?\nA group of authors has accused Meta of using pirated books to train its AI systems, allegedly with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's approval.\nWhich high-profile authors are involved in the lawsuit?\nAuthors such as Ta-Nehisi Coates and Sarah Silverman have publicly come forward in this legal battle.\nWhat is the LibGen dataset mentioned in the case?\nLibGen is a database that reportedly includes millions of pirated works and was allegedly used by Meta for AI training.\nWhat is fair use in the context of copyright law?\nFair use is a legal doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission, often cited in discussions surrounding AI technologies.\nWhat might be the implications of this case for AI development?\nThe case raises critical questions about ethical practices in AI training and the necessity for clearer copyright regulations in this rapidly evolving field.\nAbout Investors Hangout\n[Investors Hangout](https://investorshangout.com/) is a leading online stock forum for financial discussion and learning, offering a wide range of free tools and resources.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Yazoo County, Mississippi from 1901-2000 was 47.4. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming.

    "text": "Down Spooner Creek Lane is a 12-acre property near Dakota Creek that is home to national champions. They’re grass-chewing, fleece first-placers.\nThe Sunny Alpacas farm, at 9200 Spooner Creek Lane, follows its tagline “In pursuit of elite alpacas” seriously as it breeds the llama relative for shows across the country. James and Ichi Kwon came to the U.S. from South Korea in 2010. In need of a job and in possession of a life-long love of animals, James discovered alpacas.\nAfter researching the animal, James visited an alpaca show in Oregon, then an alpaca auction in Hillsboro, a city outside of Portland, in May 2011. With previous business experience from South Korea, the Kwon family bought the farm in August 2011, and Sunny Alpacas was born in 2012. The farm specialized solely in alpaca sales until last spring, when it started offering tours to the public that allows them to feed and walk the alpacas.\n“I want to show my American dream,” James said. “Here I can do that.”\nThe couple chose Blaine because of its scenic nature, proximity to the border and a general love of the city. At first, James wasn’t sure if there was money in the alpaca business. Turns out, there was.\nMost of the alpacas sold at the farm come from champion bloodlines. These alpacas come with a price tag ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Females tend to be on the higher end, due to the likelihood that they are pregnant or can become pregnant later. Since beginning in 2012, the Kwons have sold about 110 alpacas.\nSunny Alpacas produces alpacas that compete at halter and fleece competitions. Halter competitions are focused solely on the quality of the alpaca, including their grooming, how well they walk and personality. Fleece competitions are all about the quality of the alpaca’s fur.\nThe Kwons are selective about which alpacas to breed in order to produce the best offspring for both competitions. That discernment placed Sunny Farms in the top 10 of national fleece producers last year from the Alpaca Owners Association, Inc., among individual accolades the alpacas have won.\n“I wanted to be one of the best alpaca breeders before I started,” James said. “When I bought an alpaca, I very carefully chose the best bloodline, best quality. I bought 20 alpacas, and improved on some of the low-quality ones. Then we only go to major shows. We don’t compromise.”\nThe alpaca farm is named after the Kwons’ daughter, Sunny. To James, the farm isn’t about him; it’s about the future generations.\n“I want to make an estate for my next generation. When my next generation comes here, this can be their hometown,” James said. “This was not a farm. This was visible ground, but I designed an alpaca park.”\nSunny Alpacas offers tours at 2 p.m. Wednesday and Friday. On weekends and holidays, tours are given at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. All tickets must be booked in advance. The tours are limited to 30 adults and 10 children.
