    "title": "Northern Lights visible in the North Bay just outside of Napa",
    "text": "It was a \"total light show\" in the North Bay on Thursday evening. A KTVU photographer captured an astronomical phenomenon known as a geomagnetic storm. The intense aurora produced by the storm is more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights. Our photographer, Jaden Schaul, was set up near St. Helena where he captured amazing hues of blue and purple in the sky. He wrote on social media that the lights were visible to the naked eye. He posted photos as early as 7:30 p.m. About a half hour later, a photo was posted by someone else of the lights as seen from the Sierra Foothills. By 10 p.m. Schaul said the aurora was on \"full display\" from his vantage point. He posted a spectacular image of a brilliant purple sky with stars speckled throughout. Northern Lights photos filled social media feeds with much of the content coming from the East Coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&apos;s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center issued an alert saying the aurora may be visible at high latitudes, including the northern tier of the U.S., such as Michigan and Maine. That forecast was expanded to include parts of Northern California. This expansion was because the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) passage intensified. This meant that conditions were favorable for the G4 level storm to continue into the night hours. NOAA&apos;s geomagnetic storm scale goes from G1, minor, to G5, which is extreme. A G4 level storm is considered severe. Events of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) send roughly a billion tons of plasma from the sun, with its embedded magnetic field, to Earth, according to NOAA.When that solar material arrives at Earth, it can result in a geomagnetic storm.NOAA says, \"Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise.\" The aurora is not visible during daylight hours. The conditions in Napa were just right to take in the spectacle of the Aurora Borealis. The aurora provides situational awareness for a number of technologies, NOAA says. That includes a direct impact on high-frequency radio communication and GPS satellite navigation because of the major disturbance in Earth&apos;s magnetic field. NOAA has the scientific explanation for what&apos;s happening before your eyes here . They say the aurora typically forms 80 to 500 km above Earth&apos;s surface. \"During major geomagnetic storms these ovals expand away from the poles such that aurora can be seen over most of the United States. Aurora comes in several different shapes.\" When they refer to ovals, the aurora forms two ovals approximately centered at the magnetic poles. NOAA says the G4 watch remains in effect for Oct. 11.

Thotakura told ET that he hoped his journey into space as a civilian would make the idea of being an astronaut more accessible for Indian children. He said he’d been fascinated by aerospace ever since visiting a KLM plane cockpit at age eight. Thotakura is also a trained pilot who ran a medical air-evacuation service in India around a decade ago. Space was an extension of that dream. He said that his family — also into the wellness business — came to know about his plans to go into space only after Blue Origin made the official announcement. They are nervous but excited, he said. Joining him on the mission will be venture capitalist Mason Angel, French entrepreneur Sylvain Chiron, US tech entrepreneur Kenneth L Hess, retired accountant and adventurer Carol Schaller, and former US Air Force captain Ed Dwight.

Until now, Blue Origin has flown six astronaut missions, taking 31 humans above the Kármán line. That’s the boundary between earth and space and is between 80 and 100 km above sea level. Blue Origin’s pitch for the flight is simple: “On your 11-minute flight, you'll travel over 3x the speed of sound to pass the Kármán Line at 100 km, float weightless for several minutes, and witness life-changing views of earth before descending gently under parachutes.” Rise of For Thotakura, this will be a sponsored launch, although details like the identity of the sponsor and the amount paid to Blue Origin to make it happen have not been revealed. Blue Origin, along with Bezos and Blue Origin have put in place an interesting pricing strategy. What you pay could be anywhere between nothing, especially if you are a celebrity and can attract eyeballs, and $28 million. The latter was the amount paid for the first ticket to space that Blue Origin sold in an auction. William Shatner, aged 90, was invited to a New Shepard mission for free back in 2021.

    "title": "Florida Building Was the Site of a “miraculous” Image of the Virgin Mary",
    "text": "Twenty-seven years ago on December 17, 1996, residents of Clearwater, FL claimed to see something incredible on the side of a Florida office building. An unusual, stained-glass image appeared on the side of the building, which many said looked like the outline of the Virgin Mary. The image was nearly 50 feet high and 20 feet wide. After local news stations picked up the story, skeptics and believers alike flocked to the building, which was referred to as “Our lady of Clearwater.” Skeptics claimed the image came from a distortion in the glass or a stain. Even the\nSt. Petersburg Diocese told The Tampa Bay Times that “People should exercise a great deal of heavy skepticism,” and the image was a “naturally explained phenomenon.” But that didn’t stop visitors from coming. Within a few months of the image’s appearance, it is estimated over 500,000 people visited the site.\nAccording to\na Tampa Bay Times article in 2019 recalling the phenomena, “The city had to install portable restrooms and sidewalks, while police cracked down on illegal vendors trying to peddle merchandise to the visitors. Later, a nearby car wash would sell T-shirts bearing a photograph of the window for $9.99.” “It became this sort of sideshow … almost like any other Florida roadside tourist attraction. But those people who were there, especially really early on that first morning, many of them were there because they really did consider this some sort of Christmas miracle,” said Wilma Norton, who covered the story for The Tampa Bay Times, which was The St. Petersburg Times back then. People prayed, cried, and worshipped at the site. “I stepped out of my car and the presence of God just almost drew me to my knees. I believe it is here to get people’s attention that we are living in the last days … to get ready to meet the soon-coming King,” said Mary Stewart, pastor of the Campaigning for Jesus Christian Center.\nThe site’s fame also brought on hardship. A few months after the image appeared, vandals flung some liquids at the image. It was later cleared up by rainstorms, only to be shattered by a rock catapulted by an 18-year-old with a slingshot. Shepherds of Christ, the ministry that purchased the building a few years after the image appeared, did not press charges, but the 18-year-old did spend 10 days in jail. Despite the damage, many still believe the site is special. “Mary is still on the building, even though her head is not there,”\nsaid Doris Jones, president of Shepherds of Christ Ministries. She said people still come to see the image and that people are “turning to Mary, asking for help.” The building has since been renamed the Mary Image Building.",

Esta reubicación permitirá que los ciudadanos realicen inscripciones de nacimientos y otros trámites de manera rápida y segura, gracias al Sistema del Registro Único de las Personas (RUP), que garantiza el derecho a la identidad desde el parto. El gobernador de Caazapá, Christian Acosta, el intendente municipal, Derlis Molinas, el director de la Sexta Región Sanitaria, Dr. Amílcar Miño, el director del Hospital Distrital de San Juan Nepomuceno, Dr. Fabián Vera, y el Director General del Registro del Estado Civil, Rigoberto Zarza, asistieron al evento. La oficina dentro del nosocomio busca simplificar el proceso de registro de nacimientos, defunciones y otros eventos importantes, asegurando que cada niño reciba su identidad al nacer. Además, ayudará a mejorar las estadísticas nacionales, fundamentales para diseñar políticas públicas que respondan a las necesidades de la población. Gracias al Sistema RUP, los registros se realizan en línea y en tiempo real, lo que ofrece un servicio eficiente y cercano a las familias.",

    "text": "Pierre Guillet préside le mouvement des EDC.\nLe congrès des EDC qui se tient à Bordeaux du 15 au 17 mars 2024 veut interroger le travail sur toutes ses facettes. De la place du don en entreprise à l’accueil des plus fragiles.\nRéenchanter le travail, c’est le fil conducteur des assises nationales des EDC (Entrepreneurs et dirigeants chrétiens). Elles se dérouleront cette année à Bordeaux et rassembleront plus de 2 500 entrepreneurs et dirigeants d’entreprises. Face aux aspirations nouvelles associées au travail : quête de sens, juste partage de la valeur, meilleure association des salariés, ces assises veulent ouvrir le débat en s’appuyant sur la doctrine sociale de l’Église (dignité, bien commun, participation, solidarité).\nL’équilibre entre travail et repos tout comme la détection de la souffrance au travail et les moyens de la détecter feront notamment partie des thèmes abordés par une centaine d’intervenants. « Le développement des outils numériques et plus particulièrement l’émergence de l’intelligence artificielle, la place des jeunes, des plus expérimentés et des plus fragiles imposent à nos entreprises une remise en question. Quel sens mes activités ont-elles ? À quoi sert mon entreprise ? Quels fruits porte-t-elle ? », s’interroge Pierre Guillet, président des EDC.\nSoutien aux écoles de production\nLe Mouvement des Entrepreneurs et dirigeants chrétiens met aussi les mains dans le cambouis pour aider de jeunes décrocheurs à prendre pied sur le marché du travail. « Nous avons une fondation qui agit dans deux directions le savoir-faire et le savoir être. Cela se traduit par un accord cadre avec la Fédération des écoles de production. Nous soutenons l’amorçage d’une trentaine. »\nLes promotions sont constituées de petits effectifs, entre quinze et vingt qui mettent l’accent sur l’apprentissage d’un métier. « On remet ces jeunes en selle. Du concret et de la transmission qui se fait devant la machine. » Les formations qualifiantes avec un CAP à la clé « débouchent dans les trois quarts des cas sur des propositions de travail. » L’objectif est de compter une centaine d’écoles de ce type en 2025. Le président de la fédération des Ecoles de production est d’ailleurs un ancien membre des EDC. « Nous incitons les entreprises à passer des commandes aux écoles, car il faut souvent acheter des machines à commande numérique qui peuvent coûter plusieurs millions d’euros », ajoute également Pierre Guillet.\nOrganisation œcuménique créée en 1926, les EDC rassemblent en France et dans plusieurs grandes villes du monde, 3 700 dirigeants d’entreprises de toutes tailles et de tous secteurs d’activités rassemblés dans une même volonté « de faire progresser le bien commun dans l’entreprise ».\nPratique. Assises nationales des EDC du 15 au 17 mars, Palais 2 l’Atlantique, Cours Charles Bricaud à Bordeaux.",

    "text": "Filled with warm lighting and classic large round tables, the downtown Italian comfort-food spot Pascucci Restaurant will be closing its doors after 31 years of business. Its 509 State Street location has a new landlord, and the Santa Barbara staple will be a memory by the end of March.\n“It is with a very heavy heart that we announce that Pascucci Restaurant will close its doors mid-March 2025,” wrote owner Laura Knight in an open letter to the Santa Barbara community.\nOwner Laura Knight leans by the bar chairs in front of the main central area of the restaurant, amid local customers during lunch hours. | Credit: Courtesy Since the early 1990s, the restaurant has served the Santa Barbara community with team dinners, family gatherings, and nighttime liveliness. Though the State Street location has been a prominent spot for the last five years, Pascucci opened with seven tables in Paseo Nuevo for about five years. They then moved a few doors down to a larger location with a full bar, where they stayed for 21 years.\n“Through all of these locations, we’ve consistently served good food, at a fair price, in a warm and friendly environment,” wrote Knight. The restaurant has supported other local companies through their food sourcing, including Shalhoob Meat Company, Kanaloa Seafoods, Santa Barbara Roasting Company, and Jordano’s. Pascucci has also been a longtime sponsor of the annual Summer Solstice Parade, hosting an annual “Dine-Out for Solstice” event for the last 23 years.\nHowever, State Street has been emptier than usual. “Around 5:30 it can start to pick up, but ever since COVID, lunches have been pretty empty,” said Knight.\nKnight and her staff, some of whom have been working with the restaurant for more than 20 years, encourage all to enjoy a meal while they can in these last coming weeks. “We’ve had customers tell us that they came to us on a first date, then they brought their kids in, who are now adults and bringing their own kids in. We will miss all of it — and YOU,” wrote Knight.\nMost Read Recent News Small Aircraft Crashes Near Highway 101 in Goleta By Ryan P.

    "title": "Los sindicatos de Masorange exigen la “voluntariedad total” del ERE | Empresas | Cinco Días",
    "text": "Los sindicatos CC OO, UGT, USO, ELA y CGT reclamaron este viernes en una carta conjunta a la dirección de Masorange que el expediente de regulación de empleo (ERE) que ha anunciado para 795 trabajadores del grupo tenga carácter de “voluntariedad completa y absoluta” para los afectados, “sin subterfugios ni sucedáneos”. Las organizaciones sindicales, que representan a más del 90% de los trabajadores de la operadora, aseguran que ésta será una “línea roja” para llegar a un acuerdo en la mesa de negociación del ERE, que previsiblemente se constituirá el próximo martes, 17 de septiembre. La dirección afirmó el pasado 3 de septiembre en un comunicado interno a los trabajadores, coincidiendo con el anuncio del ERE, que “la voluntariedad será el primer y preferente criterio de adhesión”. Sin embargo, los sindicatos rechazan tajantemente esta propuesta al entender que bajo esa fórmula el ERE se puede convertir “en un programa de destrucción de empleo donde la dirección acepte cierta voluntariedad y que incluya despidos forzosos o prejubilaciones obligatorias”. Aseguran en el escrito que para que “el escenario de voluntariedad real pueda funcionar, serán necesarias unas condiciones indemnizatorias equivalentes, e incluso superiores, a las acordadas unánimemente por todas las partes en el ERE de Orange Espagne de 2021″ Este despido colectivo afectó a 400 personas, entre prejubilacioens y salidas voluntarias, con indemnizaciones en un tope de 42 mensualidades, entre los 57 días por año para los salarios mayores de 50.000 euros y los 62 días para los inferiores a 27.000. En su carta a la dirección, los sindicatos advierten de que emprenderán “las medidas legales y sindicales que sean necesarias para defender todos los puestos de trabajo en Masorange, así como los derechos laborales de la plantilla”. Insisten en que el ERE está “injustificado”, porque “supone la destrucción de cientos de puestos de trabajo en una compañía en progresión y con buenos resultados económicos y financieros, y que contradice las promesas realizadas por la dirección sobre no ejecutar un despido colectivo en Masorange”. “Exigimos la retirada del ERE y buscar soluciones que no impliquen echar a la calle a 795 personas, ni arriesgar imprudentemente la viabilidad de la compañía, con grave afectación para las familias de las personas afectadas y también para lo que ustedes mismos han calificado como “proyecto de crecimiento”. Consideramos que, si todas las partes actuamos de buena fe haciendo un uso correcto del diálogo social, podremos encontrar soluciones no traumáticas a los presuntos problemas que dicen haber detectado en Masorange”, agrega la carta.",
