    "text": "Stamford Walk of Witness on Good Friday show real meaning of Easter A large wooden cross was carried through a town’s streets with a parade of followers and hundreds of onlookers. More than 200 people flocked to [Stamford](https://www.lincsonline.co.uk/stamford/) High Street this afternoon (March 29) to take part in the Easter [Walk of Witness](https://www.lincsonline.co.uk/stamford/news/join-good-friday-walks-of-witness-9358519/), an event which has been taking place in the town for decades to mark Good Friday. A makeshift stage displayed the cross and was used for readings and prayers by members of the Churches Together community. The crowd joined in hymns accompanied by music from the Church Together Band. Mirroring the final hours of Jesus’ life, the wooden cross was then taken by Bob Black, who has carried it for the past two years, on a route along High Street and Broad Street. Get the news delivered straight to your inbox every morning - [sign up to The Briefing here](https://www.lincsonline.co.uk/newsletter/) At the top of Ironmonger Street the cross was put down while a hymn was sung. Hearing the drums, many passers-by stopped to watch and film the procession which carried on through Red Lion Square and onto the High Street once again. The cross was installed back into place atop the van and red fabric was attached to it. As further readings were given, there was a sudden April shower but people were undeterred. Instead they put up hoods and brollies or sheltered in shop doorways. The event was brought to a close with a prayer by the Rev Anthony Laotan, vicar of Christ Church, who spoke about how every day should be a walk of witness. “Every day we carry the cross. It is no longer an emblem of death but an emblem of life,” he said. Rob Shaw of Churches Together said he was impressed with the turnout and described the success of the event as testament to the hard work of many people. The crowd joined in The Lord's Prayer before dissipating. Did you attend the event? Let us know in the comments.",

    "title": "Dnipro's Jewish community bids farewell to a special ops. soldier",
    "text": "At the Jewish cemetery in Dnipro, Ukraine, dozens of people gathered for the funeral of Shimon Kostiantynovych, a Jewish soldier and native of the city. Shimon, an only child, was sent to the front line over a year ago and took part in Ukrainian commando operations to repel the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian military has refused to disclose details about his service or duties. Furthermore, his photograph is banned from publication, and no photos were allowed at the small funeral, which was attended by senior members of the elite unit he served in. The Jewish community in Dnipro has proudly begun referring to him as the \"Emmanuel Moreno of Ukrainian Jews,\" a metaphor likening him to Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno, who was killed in the Second Lebanon War, with his image and details still classified to this day. \"He was a hero who fought for Ukraine's freedom,\" said Rabbi Yakov Sinyakov, who is responsible for working with Jewish soldiers in Ukraine on behalf of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Ukraine (FJCU). He supports Jewish fighters at the front with morale, advanced Western equipment, and religious materials. During the funeral, his unit members shared with the family that in his final battle, Kostiantynovych managed to kill several Russian soldiers and mercenaries from another country before being killed by a direct hit from a Russian drone. It is estimated that at least 100 Jewish soldiers have died on the battlefield while serving in the Ukrainian army. Kostiantynovych is not the only Jewish soldier to fall in the past month of the war. Last month, the FJCU reported that Anton Baskonscheny was buried in his hometown of Mykolaiv after being severely wounded by two missiles that exploded near him. \"In addition to the many Jewish casualties, there are still soldiers missing who have yet to be brought to a Jewish burial. In our synagogue in Dnipro, led by Rabbi Shmuel Kaminetzky, we study and pray for their souls, confident they are crying out above for the people of Israel,\" members of the Jewish community in the city said.

    "title": "Why Jesinta Franklin is teaming up with a First Nations label – and donating her modelling fee",
    "text": "The model and super-Wag Jesinta Franklin usually loans her face to multimillion dollar brands; but her latest campaign is with a small, independent designer. And she won’t make a cent from it. Liandra Gaykamangu, a north-east Arnhem Land-based designer, said working with Franklin felt like “the stars are aligning”, but it was also a very natural fit for her sustainability-focused label, Liandra. Franklin is one of Australia’s highest profile swimwear models, most recently fronting a global campaign for the beleaguered bikini giant Seafolly. But the Liandra campaign is more personal for Franklin, who describes the partnership as “an honour”. Gaykamangu struck up a relationship with the model through mutual friends and Instagram DMs. Then coincidence brought the pair closer. While Franklin was sitting front row at Gaykamangu’s runway show last year, her husband, Buddy Franklin, was spending time with Gaykamangu’s brother’s wife, Sylvia Nulpinditj, at an AFL match in Melbourne. Related: ‘Fresh and considered’: fashion label Haulier wins Australian designer award “It just felt like a funny little sort of interconnectedness between various members of my family and her family,” Gaykamangu said. So the Yolŋu designer floated the idea of shooting a campaign together, and Franklin enthusiastically agreed. When Franklin told Gaykamangu that she would like to donate her modelling fee to a charity the pair will choose together, it was further proof of alignment for Gaykamangu. “It meant that she really understood what I cared about and what the brand stood for,” the designer said. Gaykamangu said an endorsement from “such an iconic Australian face … really helps to cement that idea of who can wear First Nations fashion, and that we are for everyone”. Jasmina Ilicic, an associate professor of marketing at Monash Business School, said a campaign like this not common. “Celebrity endorsement is normally dominated by well-known, often multinational brands that can afford the high fees associated,” Ilicic said. The academic, who studies celebrity endorsements, said she believes the campaign will be well received by consumers, because it feels genuine. “Franklin is a likable, credible and authentic celebrity,” Ilicic said. “Celebrity endorsements can have a huge impact.” Ilicic said the impact may even carry beyond the Liandra brand. “Her endorsement not only supports Indigenous designers, but also encourages consumers to think more about the origins and meanings of the garments they wear. The partnership could encourage Franklin’s followers to support smaller, community-driven brands over fast fashion alternatives,” she said. The night before the campaign shoot, Franklin caught a red eye flight to Darwin. She was on the beach in full hair and makeup by 11am. Gaykamangu was nervous, not just because of Franklin’s profile but because they were shooting in crocodile country. “In the back of my mind, I was like, ‘play it safe’,” Gaykamangu said. Crocodiles became an on-set joke. “We were kind of laughing about it, but there’d been people swimming out much further. And so we were like, ‘well, they’ll get them first probably’.” Gaykamangu said there has since been a small crocodile sighting near the shoot location. “So we definitely were in the Northern Territory, and we’re very mindful of that.” Crocodiles aside, the location was very important to Gaykamangu. “I wanted to also be able to say, ‘Hey, look to the north, look what we can do from here’.” Gaykamangu hopes to use the collection Franklin modelled to draw attention to “the incredibly damaging sea plastic pollution problem in remote East Arnhem Land”. “We have our rangers who are responsible for looking after sea and land management, and they are completely inundated with plastic pollution.” Gaykamangu’s swimwear is made with Repreve, a polyester fabric made from recycled marine waste. Over the coming weeks, the designer will work with the Marine Stewardship Council “to broaden that conversation a little bit”. Environmental advocacy is not a new development for Gaykamangu, who always envisioned the business as profit-for-purpose. Franklin said Gaykamangu’s sustainability efforts are a big part of the campaign’s appeal. “Aside from respecting her immense talent, what I love about Liandra … is her commitment to giving back to people and the planet,” she said. “Having this opportunity to support a beautiful sustainable lifestyle brand and also to come together with someone I admire … is an honour.” Related: Size-inclusive, sustainable brands: Australian fashion professionals share their favourites A celebrity spokesperson is not the only major development for Gaykamangu. The brand recently expanded its size offering up to size 20, which Gaykamangu said was “definitely something that I think is important”. In May, Liandra will hold its first standalone show at Australian fashion week. Gaykamangu said the runway show will take the brand “beyond the beach”, with more ready-to-wear garments. “We’re very keen to expand our offering and our horizons,” she said.",

    "text": "Dos hombres de nacionalidad peruana fueron detenidos por ser los presuntos autores de una serie de estafas a conductores, haciéndose pasar por mecánicos. Los detenidos, que operaban a nivel nacional, ya se encuentran en prisión preventiva.\nLa operación policial llevada a cabo por Carabineros de la SIP de la 3ª Comisaría de Antofagasta, resultó en la detención de dos hombres peruanos de 31 y 38 años. Según los antecedentes recopilados, al menos tres personas fueron víctimas de estos individuos, y se está investigando si existen más afectados.\nEl modus operandi de los imputados consistía en alertar a los conductores sobre un supuesto desperfecto en sus vehículos. Aprovechando la preocupación de los conductores, los hombres se presentaban como mecánicos y se ofrecían amablemente para revisar y arreglar el vehículo en la vía pública . Una vez que la persona aceptaba la ayuda, los impostores pedían al conductor realizar acciones como cambiar de marcha o apretar el embrague mientras ellos “revisaban” y supuestamente arreglaban el desperfecto, lo cual no era cierto.

Las investigaciones permitieron concretar la detención de estos dos sujetos, quienes además tienen antecedentes por diversos delitos, incluyendo amenazas, desacato, robo con violencia, delitos contra la salud pública, estafas y otras defraudaciones. Se ha establecido también que estos individuos operaban a nivel nacional, con registros de detenciones en Santiago, Melipilla, Concepción y Antofagasta.\nEste operativo es resultado del trabajo especializado de Carabineros de la SIP en coordinación con la Fiscalía Local. Gracias a las diligencias investigativas y el trabajo de inteligencia policial, se logró vincular a los sujetos con los ilícitos mencionados. Actualmente, ambos detenidos están en prisión preventiva por los delitos de estafa y otras defraudaciones.",

    "text": "Tired of society’s unrealistic beauty and diet standards, Katie Daniel discovered strength training — and realized that lifting weights not only transformed her physique but also her confidence and relationship with food. This led to her founding Ambition in 2018. Today, Katie’s thriving business is empowering women around Louisville to reach their health and wellness goals — and it will be helping even more women around the country when Ambition expands into a franchise model later this year. Check out her tips for looking and feeling your best in 2024. I didn’t grow up an athlete, so I wasn’t super fit. I was that textbook girl who didn’t have body confidence. I didn’t know how to eat and never felt good about my body. I was part of the generation that was told to eat lettuce and do cardio, but that clearly doesn’t work for anybody. When I was in my mid-20s, I discovered weights and started doing workouts from Pinterest; I would write them down and take them to the gym. It was the first form of exercise I liked, and that made me feel good. I started doing it often because I enjoyed it, and I also started to see my body change. I’d never felt so confident or empowered as a woman, especially since society tends to focus on flaws. I was actually working in medical sales; I wasn’t in the fitness industry at all. But I kept thinking about how working out had been so impactful to my life and my confidence — and really, my entire self-worth — that I wanted all women to have the same experience. But most women don’t want to go to the weight section in a typical gym; it can be intimidating and masculine. At the time, CrossFit was the only kind of group fitness available that focused on weights. And while that works for some people, it can be intimidating for lots of women; that’s not necessarily how they want to work out. So, I contacted a friend who owns a franchise and asked for some advice. She pointed me in the direction of the Small Business Administration. I met with their director, and from there, things took off very quickly. Within about six months, Ambition was born. We’re in the boutique fitness industry, so we offer group classes and personal training . It’s not like an open-box gym; we don’t have open gym hours. It’s group- and community-focused. With traditional strength training, you want to split your workouts by different muscle groups; you have certain muscle groups working one day and then resting the next day. So, we stagger our weekly classes based on body splits. We have upper, lower, and full-body classes. We also have different versions of full-body workouts. Find something you genuinely enjoy. No matter how you move your body, you’re only going to stick with it if you enjoy it. Everybody will find a different modality they prefer, whether it’s running, weights, spinning, or yoga. Also, there’s this expectation and pressure to work out as much as possible, be intense, and get results — but that’s not at all how it is. Slow and steady wins the race, so just listen to your body and move in a way that makes you feel empowered. You’ll naturally be able to increase the challenge as you progress. I’m actually pregnant at the moment, so I’m starting to feel a little restricted with my own movements — it’s been a good reminder that it’s OK to start small! Nutrition and diet are like fitness — anything extreme will not be sustainable. If you are super restrictive and not eating foods you like, you’re going to end up falling off the bandwagon. You have to enjoy it! One of my main tips would be that you can find carbohydrates and fat in everything, so the one thing you have to look for and prioritize is protein. Protein is really great for building muscle, and lean muscle mass is beneficial for overall health. Also, out of all three macros, protein will make you feel the most full. It’s good for weight loss because eating protein helps you feel satiated. The vast majority of people don’t get enough protein, but even if you’re a vegetarian or limiting your meat intake, you can find good sources of plant-based protein and dairy products with protein in them. I like to decide on my protein first, then build my meal from there. Life is like a leaky ship; you plug one hole, and another one sprouts. So, don’t sweat the small things and focus on what needs your attention most. I love to eat locally at Joy Luck and LouVino . Best shopping easily goes to the Paddock Shoppes , and I love walking around local businesses in NuLu on a weekend afternoon. Dry shampoo, my Bose headphones, and a barbell!
