    "text": "Greece wildfires have become a significant concern in recent years, causing widespread devastation and impacting both the environment and local communities. Why are these wildfires so frequent and intense? Several factors contribute to the increasing occurrence of these fires, including climate change, human activities, and natural conditions. Rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and strong winds create the perfect conditions for fires to ignite and spread rapidly. Additionally, human actions such as arson, negligence, and land use changes exacerbate the situation. Understanding the causes and effects of these wildfires is crucial for developing effective prevention and mitigation strategies. This article delves into 35 essential facts about Greece wildfires, shedding light on their causes, impacts, and the measures being taken to combat them.",

    "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- Heavy rain across the Tri-State Area created a mess on Saturday, with flood waters making many roadways treacherous. As the worst of the rain moved out on Saturday evening, powerful winds were set to linger into Sunday. A car was stuck in flooding on the Cross Island Parkway. The flooding has largely receded, but roads in College Point were like ponds at the rainfall's peak. In the area near Bell Boulevard, some drivers were turning around instead of trying to make it through the flooding. MTA buses on their routes were taking it slow and were still making waves. In Manhattan, heavy winds toppled a massive tree onto a car on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. In New Jersey, emergency management teams had a close eye on the Saddle River. Lodi OEM tells Eyewitness News the area is struggling with urban flooding. One man who lives in an apartment near the river says he has lost two cars due to flooding, but trying to move his car now creates more issues. On Saturday afternoon, water came up from the ground, backed up in storm drains. \"It's getting worse and worse every time it rains. Four, five floods in four months - we can't take it anymore,\" said Lodi Mayor Scott Luna. \"Until we get that Federal relief to do something with this river, we're in trouble,\" Luna added. Away from the Saddle River way before it crested at 8 p.m. Saturday, the flooding overtook the Boys and Girls Club parking lot - but the people of Lodi are never far enough away from the headaches. \"This is the problem - we move the car to the street because we don't want damage, and the city give me a ticket. Fifty dollars ticket,\" said Javees Nieves.",

    "text": "पटना, 17 जुलाई : बिहार के मुख्यमंत्री नीतीश कुमार ने घोषणा करते हुए कहा है कि राज्य के सभी घरेलू बिजली उपभोक्ताओं को 1 अगस्त से हर महीने 125 यूनिट तक मुफ्त बिजली दी जाएगी. सीएम नीतीश ने कहा है कि इस फ्री बिजली योजना से बिहार के 1 करोड़ 67 लाख परिवारों को सीधा फायदा होगा.\nयह लाभ जुलाई 2025 के बिल से लागू होगा. इस योजना से बिहार के करीब 1 करोड़ 67 लाख परिवारों को सीधा फायदा होने वाला है. मुख्यमंत्री ने यह भी ऐलान किया कि अगले तीन वर्षों में सभी घरेलू उपभोक्ताओं के घरों की छतों या नजदीकी सार्वजनिक स्थानों पर सौर ऊर्जा संयंत्र लगाए जाएंगे, जिससे बिजली की खपत और पर्यावरण संरक्षण को बढ़ावा मिलेगा. नीतीश कुमार ने अपने आधिकारिक एक्स हैंडल पर इस योजना की जानकारी साझा करते हुए बताया कि 'कुटीर ज्योति योजना' के तहत अत्यंत गरीब परिवारों के लिए सौर ऊर्जा संयंत्र लगाने का पूरा खर्च राज्य सरकार वहन करेगी. वहीं, अन्य उपभोक्ताओं के लिए भी सरकार इस कार्य में उचित आर्थिक सहायता प्रदान करेगी. यह भी पढ़ें : DMK ने तेज की विधानसभा चुनाव की तैयारी, CM स्टालिन की अध्यक्षता में आज जिला सचिवों की बैठक\nसीएम नीतीश ने कहा कि इस पहल से न केवल उपभोक्ताओं को मुफ्त बिजली मिलेगी, बल्कि बिहार में अगले तीन वर्षों में लगभग 10,000 मेगावाट सौर ऊर्जा का उत्पादन भी संभव हो पाएगा. मुख्यमंत्री ने कहा कि यह योजना बिहार को ऊर्जा के क्षेत्र में आत्मनिर्भर बनाने में मदद करेगी और लोगों के जीवन स्तर को बेहतर बनाएगी. इससे पहले सीएम नीतीश ने बिहार में अगले 5 सालों में 1 करोड़ रोजगान देने रकी बात कही थी.\nबता दें कि बिहार में इस साल के अंत में विधानसभा चुनाव होने हैं. साल के अंत में होने वाले विधानसभा चुनाव को लेकर चुनाव आयोग ने अपनी तैयारियां शुरू कर दी हैं. बिहार चुनाव के मद्देनजर चुनाव आयोग मतदाता पुनरीक्षण करा रहा है, जिसे लेकर विपक्षी दल पुरजोर विरोध कर रहे हैं. बिहार मतदाता पुनरीक्षण का मामला सुप्रीम कोर्ट में भी जा चुका है. वहीं, बिजली को लेकर की गई घोषणा का बिहार के लोगों ने स्वागत किया है. कई लोगों का मानना है कि मुफ्त बिजली और सौर ऊर्जा संयंत्रों की स्थापना से उनकी आर्थिक स्थिति मजबूत होगी.",

    "text": "Please consider a gift for Aleteia! Help us spread the joy of Christ's victory. Aleteia depends on your support. Join our Lenten Campaign 2024. DONATE NOW Marriage counselors are unanimous: [communication](/cp1/2020/10/21/what-are-the-best-tools-for-communicating-well-in-marriage/) is one of the pillars of a couple’s relationship. But what exactly do we mean by communication? We’re not talking about agreeing on dinner menus or weekend plans. Rather, it’s about the sincere, true, and reciprocal expression of your emotions, desires and needs, and the other spouse giving them an attentive and benevolent reception. This in-depth dialogue can help avoid many marital misunderstandings, with their attendant arguments and frustrations. “The first thing to build within a couple is mutual understanding of emotions,” stresses psychologist and couple therapist Marc d’Anselme. Understanding your partner’s emotions requires empathy. But given the different histories and personalities of each spouse, this is far from easy. A tiring vacation Marc d’Anselme gives a good example of a misunderstanding caused by a husband’s misunderstanding of his wife’s emotions during a rather tiring [vacation](/2021/06/22/what-a-true-vacation-looks-like/). (This is just one of many examples, and “any resemblance to facts or persons that exist or have existed would be purely coincidental.”) The wife tells her husband that she’s exhausted, needs a rest, and that it’s up to him to take over, especially with the children. Generally speaking, women are more forthcoming than men about their emotions. The husband reflects and looks for a solution. Finally, he proposes that his wife leave for four days, alone, to rest at her mother’s house… The wife looks at him in dismay. His proposal, generous and effective as it is, has fallen flat on its face. Empathy, not solutions Surprising as it may seem to men, by expressing her exhaustion, the wife is not expecting her husband to find a solution to her problem. No, she simply expects him to understand her, to hear her difficulties, to empathize, and to feel gratitude for the things she does, the very things that have exhausted her. She doesn’t want to go to her mother’s, but to spend her vacation with her husband and children. Quality time with the people she loves is her deepest desire. “The woman talks to her husband to share her emotions and activate the relationship. The man, on the other hand, is looking for a problem to solve; hence the misunderstandings,” explains Marc d’Anselme. The wife expects empathy from her husband, and vice versa. Empathy doesn’t require long thought or big decisions, just the expression of emotional understanding. “Empathy is not solving a practical problem. It involves no interpretation, no explanation, no solution, no sentimentality, just the expression of understanding!” It’s important to express this understanding in words or gestures; otherwise, it’s sadly useless. Attunement: The Holy Grail of a married couple [Empathy](/2017/08/13/4-ways-to-develop-empathy-according-to-edith-stein/) is the key to understanding the other’s emotions and, if it’s reciprocal, to the couple being in tune with each other. In physics, electrical circuits are in tune when they oscillate at the same frequency, when they are tuned to the same wavelength. In marital psychology, when spouses understand each other, this is also called attunement. When a couple is attuned, then they experience moments of “perfect unity.” Although attunement is not a lasting state—which is fortunate, because it’s good for everyone to experience their own emotions first—it does have many benefits. Empathy allows a person to feel accompanied in what they are experiencing. This has the fascinating, almost magical effect of freeing them from negative emotions, linked to the burden they were carrying alone until then. This often leads to a positive change of attitude on the part of the spouse who is listened to and understood. What’s more, in the face of life’s difficulties or trials, attunement is an important support for the couple. “An event experienced by each in communion with the other is overcome much more easily,” explains Marc d’Anselme. Encouraging emotional sharing “Marital difficulties stem primarily from the fact that, instead of understanding our partner’s emotions, we interpret his or her behavior in terms of our own,” says the therapist. Hence the line that’s often heard in marital arguments: “You really don’t understand at all!” Empathy requires us to move away from an individualistic stance and take an interest in the other person, opening ourselves up to their emotions. And the other person has to do his or her bit too, and try to express the feelings he or she is experiencing. “Emotional sharing is the best remedy for marital individualism.” It’s an excellent tool for promoting harmony. What does this mean in concrete terms? It’s a good idea for each spouse in turn to express emotions with which the other can empathize. “To get beyond facts and into emotions, spouses help each other by naming emotions.” For example: “If I were you, that would have made me angry!” or “Were you surprised?” This enables the person experiencing the emotion to clarify it, refine it, and entrust it to the other. For what purpose? To love better. Because loving, Marc d’Anselme reminds us, means “opening our hearts to our partner, to allow him or her to live a little within us,” and to live a little within him or her.",
