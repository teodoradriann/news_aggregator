    "title": "Odisha’s leopard population jumps by 22% to 696 - The Hindu",
    "text": "In some good news for wildlife enthusiasts, Odisha’s leopard population has increased by 22%, rising from 568 to 696 in two years between 2022 and 2024, despite ongoing concerns about poaching and the illegal trade of leopard skins in the State.\nThe All Odisha Leopard Estimation 2024, released on Thursday (October 3, 2024), estimates the State’s leopard population to range between 668 and 724, with a median count of 696. However, the present leopard population lags behind the 2018 census carried out by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which put Odisha’s big cats number at 760. In 2022, the population dropped to 568.\nThe Forest department had conducted estimation across 47 forest divisions, aimed at much more intensive State-level leopard monitoring. A statewide field survey was also conducted to identify the presence of leopards through various signs, including pugmarks, scrapes, scats, rakes, urine spray, vocalisations, and livestock depredation.\nUnrestrained poaching plays a role in disappearance of Odisha’s leopards Camera trap “Sites with confirmed direct or indirect evidence of leopard were monitored using camera traps to estimate the minimum number of unique adult leopards based on their distinctive rosette patterns. Camera trap identification of leopard is a scientifically recognised method and is used in national-level leopard population assessments,” says the estimation report.\nSusant Nanda, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), said: “The big cat population is healthy. In 2022, the estimation was taken up in a limited area while we had taken up the estimation in much larger area capturing leopards in camera traps. We could discover many melanistic leopards in our forests.”\nAs per the latest NTCA report, the leopard population in India stands at 13,874. The leopard population has dwindled by 75-90% across the country over the last 120-200 years. According to Wildlife Protection Society of India, around 1,485 leopards were poached in the country in the last 10 years.\nPoaching menace As per the information furnished by the Forest and Environment department in the State Assembly, as many as 59 leopard skins were seized from wildlife smugglers between 2018 and 2023. Similarly, a Special Task Force (STF) of State police has recovered 57 leopard skins from poachers and wildlife article dealers from 2019 to 2024. Overall, 116 leopards were killed and skins were peeled off. Wildlife experts said in dozens of cases, leopard skins might have reached their destinations unnoticed and unintercepted.\nOdisha’s forest cover accounts for 33.50% of the State’s total geographic area. The State government said there is one national park, 19 wildlife sanctuaries and two conservation reserves in Odisha.\nThe latest population estimate report says, “Protected areas proved to be the regions with the highest leopard abundance. Similipal Tiger Reserve has the largest leopard population in Odisha. Due to its extensive size, Similipal landscape plays a crucial role as a source population for leopards in the surrounding region. It is connected to Hadagarh Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary, which is essential for leopards to disperse from Similipal to these other protected areas.”\nThe report further states that Satkosia landscape turned out to be another promising site for leopards and boasts of the second highest leopard population in the State. Similarly, Hirakud Wildlife Division, which includes Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary, is another key habitat for leopards and has a significant leopard population.\n“As high as 45% of the leopard population in Odisha is located outside the protected area network and thus the territorial forest divisions have considerable leopard presence. The rare melanistic leopard morph was recorded from three forest divisions,” it observes.\n“From the next year, this camera trap based All Odisha Leopard Estimation exercise will be synchronised with the annual All Odisha Tiger Estimation exercise. This comprehensive exercise will involve collecting data on both the big cat occupancy, prey base estimation, and assessments of vegetation structure and human disturbance in the State,” the Forest department said.\nPublished - October 04, 2024 08:45 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "title": "Zero-emissions vehicle standard lauded by Sea to Sky MP",
    "text": "Squamish and the Sea to Sky set the standard for zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) adoption in Canada, according to West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler. “While B.C is leading the country in terms of zero-emissions vehicle adoption rates, the leading metropolitan area is actually Squamish,” said Weiler immediately after the federal government released its Electric Vehicle Availability Standard earlier this month. “Right now in Canada, transportation is our second-biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions—it’s about a quarter of Canada’s emissions,” he said. The new standard, announced by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault on Tuesday, Dec. 19, is designed to phase out the sale of vehicles powered solely by gas or diesel completely by 2035, by ramping up the percentage of ZEVs required to be sold by automakers in Canada over a 12-year period. The standard, which will be rolled out Canada-wide, starts with a 20-per-cent ZEV sales requirement in 2026, and keeps going up each year until it’s 100 per cent by 2035. “Given that the average age of a vehicle is 15 years, putting in place a 100-per-cent ZEV sales target by 2035 will help end the use of polluting light-duty vehicles by 2050,” [reads the government release on the standard](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2023/12/canadas-electric-vehicle-availability-standard-regulated-targets-for-zero-emission-vehicles.html). The new federal standard is not as aggressive as the B.C. provincial standard ( [introduced in October](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023EMLI0043-001640?utm_source=pique%20newsmagazine&utm_campaign=pique%20newsmagazine:%20outbound&utm_medium=referral)), but still reaches the same 100-per-cent ZEV target by 2035. Comparing the two, the B.C. standard sets targets of 26 per cent ZEV sales by 2026 (compared to 20 federally), 90 per cent by 2030 (60 per cent federally), and 100 per cent by 2035. Governed by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, automakers will be issued credits for each ZEV they sell, with credits determined by how far a vehicle can travel while only powered by a battery. Automakers can bank credits if they sell more than the required percentage of vehicles, or sell them to other automakers. They can also make up 10 per cent of the credits they need annually by investing in public charging stations. Companies that don’t meet the target will generate a deficit they must discharge within three model years. Weiler said B.C. is already well ahead of the curve in electric vehicle sales (21 per cent in 2022), and is setting the standard for Canada. “B.C. leads the way with zero-emissions mandates, and we can see the impact of that. We want a model that is good practice, and to replicate that elsewhere. B.C. has for a long time been an innovator, and this is another good example of that,” he said. “We’re not quite where Norway is, where over 80 per cent of new vehicles sold last year were zero-emissions vehicles, but we’re certainly leading in North America, and that’s why we’re seeing it’s easier to get an electric vehicle here than it is in other provinces.” Electric vehicles are known to be more expensive than their internal-combustion counterparts—an issue acknowledged by Canadian governments, which offer incentives to early ZEV buyers to bring the price tags closer to parity. Weiler said in the long-run, ZEVs make more sense for Canadians due to lower fuel and maintenance costs, and even now are dropping in price and becoming more affordable. Another common issue raised by critics of ZEV adoption is their higher mineral requirements. Weiler said encouraging more sustainable mining practices is an important part of the equation in decarbonizing the global economy, but dismissed a common trope that electric vehicles are somehow more damaging to the environment than their gas-powered counterparts due to the resources needed to create them. “I categorically dismiss the notion that electric vehicles are somehow less environmentally sustainable than gas-powered cars,” he said. “The materials that are required to build it in the first place have slightly higher impact, but when we’re talking about Canada, already 85 per cent of our grid is non-emitting, and we’re committed to getting to 100 per cent by 2030. There is little to no environmental impact with the operation of the vehicle over time, whereas when we’re talking about gasoline-powered, that is a quarter of our emissions in Canada, so imagine if we’re able to draw that down to near zero.” The proliferation of electric vehicles globally is another opportunity for Canada, said Weiler. “We’ve brought forward our critical minerals strategy, and provinces like British Columbia are large producers of copper, so we need to expand on that and do it in a sustainable way.” Consumer purchases of ZEVs under the new Zero Emissions Vehicle Standard will be supported by the federal government investing $2 billion in its incentives program, which offers up to $5,000 in incentives to buyers across the country. Coupled with provincial incentives, buyers in B.C. can have as much as $9,000 knocked off the price of a ZEV if they qualify. There will also be efforts to vastly expand the public charger network in Canada. Currently, there are more than 25,000 across the country, and the government plans to install more than 43,000 more.",

Selon un rapport, publié en mai 2023 par un think tank britannique spécialisé dans les questions de défense, les Ukrainiens perdaient quelque 10 000 drones par mois sur le champ de bataille, soit plus de 300 par jour. A titre de comparaison, l'armée française dispose d'un peu plus de 3 000 avions sans pilote dans ses arsenaux.\nUkrainiens et Russes utilisent essentiellement de petits UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle, en anglais) d'origine civile, bon marché et disponibles en grand nombre. Ils servent à observer le champ de bataille et à guider les troupes ou les tirs d'artillerie ; certains sont aussi bricolés pour porter de petites charges explosives, larguées ensuite sur des tranchées ou des blindés.\nMoins nombreux, les drones-kamikazes jouent également un rôle important. Dotés d’une charge explosive, ces UAV sont lancés au-dessus de la ligne de front sans objectif attribué à l’avance. Moscou utilise des drones russes Lancet-3, ainsi que des Shahed-136, de fabrication iranienne. Dépourvue d’une flotte de guerre digne de ce nom, l’Ukraine nargue l’ennemi avec des engins maritimes sans pilote, des petits kayaks guidés à distance et chargés d’explosifs (450 kilos de TNT).\nSigne de l’importance des drones pour leurs opérations, les Ukrainiens comme les Russes se sont organisés pour pouvoir alimenter leurs troupes dans la durée, non seulement en achetant en masse des drones civils sur le marché, mais aussi en mettant sur pied des capacités de production endogènes. Balbutiante au début de la guerre du Donbass, déclenchée il y a dix ans, l’industrie nationale ukrainienne est depuis montée en puissance. A la fin d'août, le ministre de la transformation numérique ukrainien a annoncé qu’une copie du drone russe Lancet avait été mise au point et serait bientôt lancée sous le nom de Peroun, dieu slave de la foudre et du tonnerre.\nEntravée par les sanctions occidentales, qui limitent son approvisionnement en composants électroniques, la Russie est plus à la peine. Mais, selon les services de renseignement américains, Moscou aurait toutefois commencé la construction d’une usine dans la zone économique spéciale d’Alabouga, afin d’y fabriquer des drones-kamikazes de conception iranienne, comme les Shahed-136.\nQue sait-on des stocks de missiles russes ?\nIl est très difficile, voire impossible, de connaître l’état actuel des stocks de missiles de l’armée russe. Les services de renseignement ukrainiens communiquent régulièrement sur le sujet, mais leurs estimations sont sujettes à caution.\nSelon Andri Ioussov, porte-parole de la direction générale du renseignement du ministère de la défense (GUR), cité par\nLiga.net, l’armée russe disposait de 2 300 missiles balistiques ou de croisière avant la guerre et en avait encore plus de 900 au début de l’année. A ce total, s’ajoutent, d’après le porte-parole, une dizaine de milliers de missiles antiaériens S-300, d’une portée de l’ordre de 120 kilomètres, et un stock important de S-400, déclinaison plus récente d’une portée trois fois supérieure. En août, Vadym Skibitsky, numéro deux du GUR, avançait le chiffre de 585 missiles d’une portée supérieure à 500 kilomètres.\nEn ce qui concerne les capacités de production, elles seraient passées à une centaine de missiles balistiques ou de croisière par mois, selon\nplusieurs experts. En octobre, le GUR évaluait cette production à 115 exemplaires.\nLa Russie aurait, par ailleurs, acquis des missiles à courte portée en Iran et en Corée du Nord et continuerait à s’en procurer. Selon\nl’agence Reuters, qui cite plusieurs sources iraniennes, 400 missiles iraniens de la famille Fateh-110 (300 à 700 kilomètres) lui auraient été livrés depuis janvier, date à laquelle un accord aurait été conclu. On ignore combien de missiles nord-coréens la Russie s’est procuré, mais 24 ont été tirés en Ukraine entre le 30 décembre 2023 et le 7 février 2024, selon le procureur général, Andriy Kostin. D’après les experts qui ont analysé les débris et les trajectoires, il s’agit probablement de KN-23 et KN-24 d’une portée de l’ordre de 400 kilomètres.\nQuid des avions de combat F-16 ?\nAccédant à une demande de long-terme de la part du président ukrainien, les Etats-Unis ont, en août 2023, donné leur accord au transfert d’avions de combat F-16 à l’Ukraine. S’il existe une flotte potentielle de plus de 300 F-16 dans neuf pays d’Europe – en Belgique, au Danemark, en Grèce, aux Pays-Bas et au Portugal, entre autres –, tous les Etats qui en disposent ne sont pas en mesure d’en céder du jour au lendemain.\nVolodymyr Zelensky avait avancé le chiffre de 42 F-16 promis par les alliés occidentaux à Kiev, mais cette donnée n’a pas été confirmée. Le Danemark en a promis 19. Les 6 premiers ne devaient pas être livrés avant la fin de 2023, 8 autres suivront en 2024 et 5 en 2025, selon la première ministre danoise, Mette Frederiksen. Les Pays-Bas, qui en ont promis aussi, disposent de 42 unités, mais ils n’ont pas précisé combien ils comptaient en céder.\nPar ailleurs, les pilotes ukrainiens doivent être formés à ces avions de combat américains. Onze pays alliés de Kiev se sont engagés à prendre en charge des pilotes. L’OTAN a estimé que les soldats ukrainiens ne seraient en mesure d’utiliser les avions en situation de combat qu’au début de 2024, d’autres experts visent plutôt l’été de la même année.\nQuel soutien militaire ses alliés fournissent-ils à Kiev ?\nDeux ans après le début de la guerre à grande échelle, la dynamique du soutien occidental à Kiev est en perte de vitesse : les aides nouvellement engagées sont en baisse sur la période d’août 2023 à janvier 2024 par rapport à la même période de l’année précédente,\nselon le dernier rapport de l’Institut Kiel, publié en février 2024. Et cette tendance pourrait se poursuivre, le Sénat américain peinant à faire voter des aides, et l’Union européenne (UE) ayant eu toutes les difficultés à faire adopter une aide de 50 milliards le 1er février 2024, du fait du blocage hongrois. A noter, ces deux paquets d’aide ne sont pas encore pris en compte dans le dernier bilan fait par l’Institut Kiel, qui s’arrête en janvier 2024.\nLes données de l’institut allemand montrent que le nombre de donateurs se réduit et se concentre autour d’un noyau de pays : les Etats-Unis, l’Allemagne, les pays du nord et de l’est de l’Europe, qui promettent à la fois une aide financière élevée et de l’armement de pointe. Au total, depuis février 2022, les pays qui soutiennent Kiev se sont engagés à hauteur d’au moins 276 milliards d’euros sur le plan militaire, financier ou humanitaire.\nEn valeur absolue, les pays les plus riches se sont montrés les plus généreux. Les Etats-Unis sont de loin les premiers donateurs, avec plus de 75 milliards d’euros d’aide annoncés, dont 46,3 milliards en aide militaire. Les pays de l’Union européenne ont annoncé à la fois des aides bilatérales (64,86 milliards d’euros) et des aides communes provenant des fonds de l’Union européenne (93,25 milliards d’euros), pour un total de 158,1 milliards d’euros.\nLorsque l’on rapporte ces contributions au produit intérieur brut (PIB) de chacun des pays donateurs, le classement change. Les Etats-Unis rétrogradent au vingtième rang (0,32 % de leur PIB), bien après des pays voisins de l’Ukraine ou d’anciennes républiques soviétiques amies. L’Estonie prend la tête des aides rapportées au PIB avec 3,55 %, suivie du Danemark (2,41 %) et de la Norvège (1,72 %). Le reste du top 5 est complété par la Lituanie (1,54 %) et la Lettonie (1,15 %). Les trois Etats baltes, qui ont tous des frontières communes avec la Russie ou son alliée la Biélorussie, font partie des donateurs les plus généreux depuis le début du conflit.\nAu classement du pourcentage de PIB, la France est vingt-septième, ayant engagé avec 0,07 % de son PIB, juste derrière la Grèce (0,09 %). L’aide fournie par Paris est en recul constant depuis le début de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie – la France était vingt-quatrième en avril 2023, et treizième à l’été 2022.\nQue sait-on des tensions à la frontière entre l'Ukraine et la Pologne ?\nDepuis plusieurs mois, les relations sont difficiles entre l'Ukraine et la Pologne. Le transit des céréales en provenance d'Ukraine est au cœur des tensions. Au printemps 2022, la Commission européenne avait mis en place des « voies de solidarité » pour faciliter l'évacuation et la vente de produits agricoles ukrainiens, sans droits de douane, vers l'Afrique et le Moyen-Orient. Mais « depuis le début du conflit, ce sont près de 50 % des céréales ukrainiennes qui transitent ou achèvent leur parcours dans l'Union européenne (UE), selon la Fondation Farm, cercle de réflexion autour des questions agricoles mondiales. Or, ces céréales affichent un prix beaucoup plus bas que le blé produit en UE, notamment dans les pays d'Europe centrale ».\nArguant que ces céréales déstabilisent le marché local et donc les revenus de leurs agriculteurs, la Pologne, la Bulgarie, la Hongrie, la Roumanie et la Slovaquie avaient bloqué unilatéralement leurs importations en avril 2023. Un embargo que Bruxelles avait accepté, à condition qu'il n'empêche pas le transit vers d'autres pays et qu'il ne dure que quatre mois. Estimant que le problème de fond n'avait pas été réglé, Varsovie a décidé de ne pas rouvrir sa frontière aux céréales ukrainiennes à la fin de l'été, alors que Bruxelles estimait que l'embargo n'avait plus de raison d'être car ses analyses montraient « qu'il n'y avait plus de distorsion des marchés nationaux pour les céréales ».\nLes agriculteurs polonais bloquent depuis la frontière entre l'Ukraine et la Pologne pour empêcher les camions ukrainiens d'entrer sur le territoire national, les protestataires réclamant un « embargo complet » sur les produits agricoles et alimentaires ukrainiens. Ils dénoncent notamment l'explosion de leurs coûts de production alors que silos et entrepôts sont saturés et que les prix sont au plus bas. Le président ukrainien estimait au début de 2024 que le blocus de la frontière polonaise témoignait de « l’érosion de la solidarité » envers son pays, et a réclamé des pourparlers avec la Pologne. « Seul Moscou se réjouit » de ces tensions, a-t-il aussi affirmé, dénonçant « l’apparition de slogans ouvertement pro-Poutine ».",

    "text": "La baisse alarmante des populations d'abeilles indigènes au Cambodge met en péril la biodiversité et la sécurité alimentaire. Un appel urgent est lancé pour leur protection.\n[Écrit par Lepetitjournal Cambodge]\nUne étude récente intitulée \"Current Status, Challenges, and Perspectives in the Conservation of Native Honeybees and Beekeeping in Cambodia\" révèle que les populations d'abeilles indigènes du Cambodge sont en déclin. Selon Eric Guerin, auteur principal de l'étude, \"83 espèces d'abeilles ont été recensées dans le pays, mais cette liste est encore incomplète et de nombreuses espèces restent à découvrir.\"\nLa perte d'habitats due à la déforestation, les incendies, l'agriculture intensive et le changement climatique constituent les principales menaces. La consommation de couvain d'abeilles (larves et nymphes), une pratique locale, aggrave la situation surtout pour l'abeille géante d'Asie et l'abeille naine rouge, entraînant la destruction de milliers de nids chaque année.\nDisparitions et espèces menacées\nLe déclin de l'abeille géante d'Asie est flagrant. Eric Guerin rappelle : \"en 1948, jusqu'à 90 colonies pouvaient occuper un seul 'arbre à abeilles'. Aujourd'hui, ces rassemblements massifs ont disparu, et les colonies restantes, comme celles du Ta Prohm dans le parc archéologique d'Angkor, ne comptent plus qu'une vingtaine de nids.\"\nL'abeille naine noire (Apis andreniformis), quant à elle, se limite aux forêts humides éparses du Cambodge et semble déjà isolée dans certaines régions, ce qui accentue le risque d'extinction locale.\nPourquoi cette disparition nous concerne\nLes abeilles ne se contentent pas de produire du miel : elles jouent un rôle essentiel dans la pollinisation des plantes sauvages et cultivées. Eric Guerin précise : \"De nombreux arbres et plantes forestiers cambodgiens dépendent de cette pollinisation pour leur reproduction. Sans elles, la régénération des forêts serait gravement compromise.\"\nCertaines cultures commerciales, comme les noix de cajou, le longane, le café et le manguier, reposent aussi sur la pollinisation des abeilles. Un déficit de pollinisateurs pourrait déjà affecter les rendements agricoles, menaçant l'économie du pays et la subsistance de nombreux agriculteurs.\nLes apiculteurs et chasseurs de miel cambodgiens voient également leur source de revenus diminuer. \"La disparition des abeilles privera les consommateurs de miel sauvage et aggravera la précarité des populations rurales\", insiste Eric Guerin.\nQuelles solutions pour protéger les abeilles cambodgiennes ?\nEric Guerin souligne l'importance de la sensibilisation pour inverser cette tendance : \"Le premier pas pour résoudre un problème est de le comprendre en profondeur.\" Il préconise d'approfondir les connaissances sur la biologie des abeilles, d'évaluer leur rôle dans la pollinisation des cultures clés, et d'analyser les pratiques agricoles nuisibles avant de promouvoir des alternatives durables.\nIl appelle à une campagne immédiate pour informer le public des conséquences néfastes de la consommation de couvain. \"Consommer le couvain, c'est détruire l'avenir des colonies d'abeilles. Cette pratique doit être freinée si nous voulons préserver nos écosystèmes\", avertit-il.",

    "text": "Israeli Defense Minister Gallant, who continues military operations in the Gaza Strip, said on the 29th that \"the results are admirable, and the goal is not far off,\" and emphasized that the results are being achieved in the southern Khan-Yunis. With more than 2,1500 people killed in the Gaza Strip, more have been forced to flee as fighting intensifies in the south. The Israeli army, which is expanding its ground operations in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, announced on the 30th that it had killed dozens of fighters of the Islamic group Hamas in Gaza City, which it said it had already encircled. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said on Monday that \"the intensive operations in the Gaza Strip will continue until the goal is achieved, and it is currently concentrated in Khanheis in the south. The results have been admirable, and we are far from achieving our goals,\" he said, emphasizing that the operation in the southern city of Khaneunis, where Hamas officials are believed to be hiding, has yielded results. Health authorities in the Gaza Strip said on the 29th that the death toll so far has risen to 29,2. OCHA = UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs points out that more than 1507,10 people have fled further south to Rafah in the past few days due to the intensification of fighting in Khan Yunis, where the Israeli army is expanding its operations. While many people are displaced and the delivery of humanitarian aid has become an urgent issue, OCHA says that the number of trucks that entered the Gaza Strip on the 29th is 81, which continues to be insufficient, and it is necessary to stop the fighting for further deliveries.",
