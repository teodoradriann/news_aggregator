    "text": "[ikipol](/user/ikipol)a [elconfidencial.com](/go/link/3969494)\nDesigualdad y empobrecimiento no son lo mismo. En Cuba son todos muy iguales y muy pobres.\nPero igual la única causa de la inflación está en el estado y el banco central (la FED) ni debería existir.\n¿Cuál era la inflación acumulada en los últimos 100 años antes de la existencia de la FED? Ya os lo digo: no daba ni 0%, era negativa (-20%).\nLas clases bajas tienen pocos activos que se revaloricen, y ahorran en 'dinero' en el banco.\nMientras que las clases altas no ahorran su patrimonio en 'dinero' sino que invierten en activos no monetarios (y si pueden diversifican: acciones, inmuebles, metales preciosos, criptomonedas, etc....).\nPor tanto, resulta evidente que al aumentar la inflación (aka el precio de los productos = reducción del valor real del dinero) pues los ricos están mucho más protegidos.\nLa inflación es un impuesto para pobres, y los mantiene en la pobreza.\nY si nos vamos a casa extremos de hiperinflación como en Venezuela o Argentina pues a ver quién es el guapo que sale de pobre..\n[#2](c2#c-2) La inflación favorece a los endeudados, ricos o pobres, y el más endeudado de todos es el estado.\nHoy en día cualquier pobre puede comprar acciones, bonos, oro o los que sea.",

    "text": "Rise in culex population: Mosquito menace continues\nDespite a drop in dengue cases due to the winter chill, city dwellers continue to suffer from an alarming rise in mosquito infestations, with authorities failing to take effective measures to control the surge in Culex mosquitoes.\nExperts warn that without immediate intervention, the Culex mosquito population will keep increasing until March.\nThey also stressed the importance of targeting Aedes mosquitoes during this period by identifying dengue-positive households and launching preemptive mosquito control drives.\nResidents across the capital are struggling to cope with the mosquito menace.\nSaiful Alam, a resident of Mirpur-12, said it has become nearly impossible to sleep at night without a mosquito net or repellent. \"I often have to use mosquito repellent even during the day just to protect myself,\" he added.\nSabakat Sabris Sami, an HSC candidate from East Shewrapara, said, \"Mosquito numbers have increased dramatically recently. We have not seen any anti-mosquito drives in our area for weeks.\"\nMd Kamal, a resident of Dhalkanagar Lane in Gandaria, echoed him.\nEntomologist Kabirul Bashar said, \"Cleaning drains and waterbodies and applying larvicide simultaneously is the key to controlling mosquitoes. However, simply applying larvicide without cleaning the drains will not yield results.\"\nEntomologist GM Saifur Rahman said, \"There is no specific body to take effective measures against mosquitoes. If we can eliminate breeding sites such as canals, stagnant waterbodies, and lakes, we can solve 70 percent of the problem.\"\nHe said last year's failure to control Aedes mosquitoes resulted in a nationwide dengue outbreak.\n\"If the authorities locate and destroy Aedes mosquito breeding clusters now, it will be much easier to control their population during the peak season,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, entomologist Monzur A Chowdhury highlighted the importance of tackling Aedes mosquitoes during the winter lull.\n\"The number of Aedes mosquitoes has decreased due to the cold weather. This is the perfect time to identify dengue-affected households and conduct extensive anti-mosquito drives around them to eliminate breeding sources and adult mosquitoes,\" he said.\nDNCC Chief Health Officer Brig Gen Imru-al-Quais, speaking at a programme at Nagar Bhaban, said apart from their regular anti-mosquito drives, they have their own surveillance system to control Aedes mosquitoes.\n\"We have also formed an expert committee to oversee the situation,\" he said.\nRegarding Culex mosquitoes, Dr Md Emdadul Hoque, health officer of DNCC, said they have strengthened anti-mosquito drives in areas from where complaints were received.\n\"Since this is a transitional period, the Culex population has increased slightly but not to an alarming level,\" he claimed.\nOfficials of Dhaka city corporations said their routine anti-mosquito drives are ongoing.",

    "text": "By Solange Reyner | Thursday, 27 June 2024 04:37 PM EDT There's no question the Biden administration has been weighing in on social media platforms, Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., told Newsmax. \"My congrats to Newsmax for being objective and really calling it like you see them because there's no question that the government under the Biden administration has been weighing in on social media platforms,\" Meuser said Thursday during an appearance on \"American Agenda.\" \"In fact, I just had a hearing with the Small Business Committee, where it was largely admitted that they were picking and choosing what was misinformation, what was information, what was disinformation. \"And it really turned out that everyone on the list where there was so-called misinformation were conservative groups. And they admitted that they were engaged in such censorship. They didn't call it censorship, but that's really what it is.\" The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security. By a 6-3 vote, the justices threw out lower-court rulings that favored Louisiana, Missouri and other parties in their claims that federal officials leaned on the social media platforms to unconstitutionally squelch conservative points of view. Meuser said the court ruling \"was really a little disappointing because it based its decision on standing … and that there would be no future harm done via the government.\" \"They couldn't prove that there would be future harm,\" he added. \"And so, they stated, moving forward, If you're going to file a lawsuit, you got to put it against the social media platforms themselves,\" Meuser said. \"But it's contradictory to a next ruling they had where it was an NRA and insurance company where the government by proxy was indirectly affecting what the insurance companies could do in providing insurance to gun dealers and yet they ruled that that was not allowed. \"So, it was a real inconsistency in the court rulings, which I don't necessarily understand. And it is a little bit disappointing because, you know, the government involved is telling social media or any media outlet what's information and what isn't is against the First Amendment.\" About NEWSMAX TV: NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America! © 2024 Newsmax.

    "text": "Action adventure game Shenmue, which first launched in 1999, has been named the most influential game of all time in a public poll run by Bafta.\nThe game, which launched on the Sega Dreamcast, beat high-profile titles including Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario Bros and Minecraft to receive the most votes.\nIt tells the story of Ryo Hazuki’s quest to avenge his father’s death, and is considered a pioneer in open-world gameplay and for popularising the use of quick time events – where players have to perform specific actions on their controller within a set time limit when prompted.\nShenmue topped the poll ahead of first-person shooter Doom, Super Mario Bros, Half-Life and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\nThe top ten was completed by Minecraft, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Super Mario 64, Half-Life 2 and The Sims.\nOther hugely popular and industry-defining titles including Tetris, Tomb Raider, Pong and Grand Theft Auto were also named among the top 21 games in the poll.\nLuke Hebblethwaite, head of games at Bafta, said: “In the run-up to these results, we’ve been thrilled to see the community of both game makers and fans come together to share stories and champion the games that they see as having tremendous influence, creating a vibrant, positive celebration and conversation about some of the very best games our industry has ever produced.\n“Games are an immensely innovative force and it’s brilliant to recognise those titles which have truly shaped the course of our medium.\n“We hope that these results provide a fresh appreciation of the impact of the winning games and inspire us all to continue to celebrate the most influential titles of the medium we all love.”\nYu Suzuki, creator of the Shenmue franchise, said: “I am deeply honoured and grateful that Shenmue has been selected as the most influential video game of all time.\n“At its inception, we set out to explore the question – ‘How real can a game become?’ – aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail. This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement.\n“Above all, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the fans around the world who have continued to love and support Shenmue.\n“Your passion and encouragement have guided this journey every step of the way. And the story is not over yet, there is more to come! Thank you very much!”\nThe announcement of the poll results come ahead of the 21st Bafta Game Awards, which take place on Tuesday April 8.\nHouse Rules\nWe do not moderate comments, but we expect readers to adhere to certain rules in the interests of open and accountable debate.\nRead the rules here\nYou must verify your phone number before you can comment.\nPlease enter your phone number below, and a verification code will be sent to you by text message.\nPlease enter the six-digit verification code sent to you by SMS.\n[Didn’t receive a code?

    "title": "Miller High's Setsianna Kraynak is a girl for all seasons - Daily Bulletin",
    "text": "Back in 1966 there was a film, “A Man for All Seasons,” about Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England.\nNow Miller High School has a girl for all seasons. She is senior Setsianna “Setsi” Kraynak, who currently excels in basketball and wrestling. But that is not all.Kraynak was a back-up placekicker on the football team, making one extra point. She also runs track and previously played two seasons of softball, and one season of golf. As if all that is not enough, she also plays club soccer during the fall and spring.Oh, and she rocks a 4.0 grade point average, with a particular love of mathematics.Asked about her frenetic ways Kraynak said, “I like staying active. If I am ever just sitting around all day, I feel lazy and feel the need to do something.”The Miller girls’ basketball team leads host Pacific 40-11 with 2:30 left in the third quarter. Kraynak grabs a rebound and dribbles the length of the court, pigtails bobbing. Then she dishes to a teammate for a score. The girls rejoice as they retreat to the other end.Kraynak scores only eight points on this night, which is four points below her average. But she makes her presence felt with her defense and rebounding.“She brings a lot of athleticism and contributes to a lot of our points,” Rebels coach Veronica Anaya said.Kraynak also enjoys wrestling, which is good because her father Jim Kraynak is the coach. But she prefers basketball.“I like basketball because it’s more fun to play with a team,” she said. “We build each other up and form relationships that will last a lifetime.”The Miller girls basketball team is currently tied for first place in the Mountain Valley League standings after splitting games with Indian Springs. The Rebels travel to San Bernardino for a league game Thursday night.Kraynak is dedicated. Appearing on NBC news last year, she told Mario Solis, “I don’t go to practice to just go to practice. I go to work, and to learn and grow.”That extends to outside the athletic arena, where she shines in science, technology, engineering, and math. She says she would like to be an athletic director.“I want to major in Kinesiology or Sports Management,” Kraynak said. “I love being involved in sports and am a big supporter of both boys and girls sports competition.”Outside of sports, the 18-year-old is a prankster. Along with her twin brother Beckmond and 16-year-old brother Baird, the Kraynak kids relish practical jokes.“We can’t get through April Fools’ Day without them,” said mom Rianna Kraynak. “Last year on April Fools Day we let them stay at home and they drove to Big Bear. They sent us photos of them in the snow.”Kraynak wrestles in the Halloween Open at Cerritos College. She battles a girl from Rancho Bernardo High. Not wasting any time, she takes down her foe and rolls her over. Just like that, it’s done. The referee slaps the mat. Kraynak removes her headgear and waits to have her hand raised.Despite not practicing much because of basketball, Kraynak is 19-2 on the mat this season and 96-34 for her career.She was a two-time Mountain Valley League champion at 116 pounds and last year won the league title at 120 pounds. Now she wrestles at 125 pounds and is ranked 11th in the CIF Southern Section.“As a wrestler, her strength, speed and stamina make a difference,” Jim Kraynak said. “Since she practices basketball, she rarely comes to wrestling practice. But she’s still able to compete with or beat the best of them.”",
