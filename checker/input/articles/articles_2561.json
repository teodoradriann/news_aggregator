    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 (Bernama) -- Saudi Arabia has issued directives prohibiting the broadcasting or transmission of prayers, including the Tarawih prayer on all types of media outlets during the upcoming Ramadan.\nThe directive was announced by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance, and was posted on its X account Wednesday through its set of instructions and directives to mosques in preparation for the month of Ramadan in March.\n“The ministry also stressed the need to set controls for installing cameras in mosques and not to use them to film imam and worshipers during prayers…” the statement read.\nThe directives also included that imam be responsible for giving permission to the worshippers, verifying that there are no violations on their part, and that imam be aware of the information of the worshippers, and requesting the approval of the sponsor approved for non-Saudis.\nThe ministry also stressed on prohibition to collect financial donations for projects to provide iftar (breaking fast) for fasting and others. Iftar for the fasting – if any – should be in the places prepared for that in the courtyards of the mosque, and under the responsibility of imam and muezzin (the person who voices the azan).\nThe person in charge of providing iftar for the fasting should clean the place immediately after iftar and not to create any temporary rooms or tents or the like to hold iftar in them, the statement said.\nThe ministry also called on mosque employees, including imams, advocates and khatibs, to intensify religious awareness by explaining the virtue of the holy month of Ramadan, explaining its rulings, stocking up on good deeds, being keen on the virtues of deeds and acts of worship, and making an effort to exploit its blessed days and nights.\nThe mosque inspectors will intensify their field visits to ensure that all instructions issued to mosque employees are implemented and to take legal measures against those who violate them, the statement read.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

    "text": "Oropouche virus 101: A guide to a little-known virus that's raising concern this year The medical journal The Lancet calls it a [“mysterious” and “emerging” threat.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00516-4/fulltext) PAHO, the Pan American Health Organization, has issued an [epidemiological alert](https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-alert-oropouche-region-americas-1-august-2024) urging for increased prevention, surveillance and diagnosis. The subject of these alerts is the Oropouche virus, named after a village in Trinidad where it was first identified in 1955. Like malaria, dengue and Zika, it’s spread by insect bites – mosquitoes as well as midges, biting flies. The symptoms are typical of many viruses and usually last a week: fever, rash, muscle aches, headache. Here’s what we know about the virus (pronounced o-ro-push) – and why The Lancet uses those two concerning adjectives. How do humans catch Oropouche? Oropouche is harbored in birds, monkeys, rodents and sloths – in fact it’s sometimes called “sloth fever.” It’s an arbovirus like dengue, Zika and Chikungunya – the term refers to any disease caused by insect bites. If a mosquito or a midge – a tiny biting fly – bites an infected critter and then goes for a blood meal from a human, the virus can take root and cause illness. Where is it “emerging”? Case counts used to be fairly low and confined to the Amazon Basin – the area around the river, with reports of Oropouche in Brazil, Panama and Peru. But in 2024, case counts, while still dwarfed by viruses like dengue, are definitely up. In Brazil, the number of Oropouche cases has jumped from 832 in 2023 to 7,284 so far in 2024. And for the first time, there have been reports of Oropouche cases in Bolivia (with 356 cases) and Cuba (with 74 confirmed cases so far). In addition, travelers infected with the virus have been identified in Germany, Italy and Spain, although they are thought to have contracted the virus in Cuba. No local transmission in Europe has occurred. Why is it popping up in new places? Climate change seems to be a key culprit, as heavier rainy seasons have led to more mosquitoes and midges. In addition, record rates of felling trees in the Amazon forest have displaced the usual animal targets of mosquitoes and midges, so they’re hungry for humans. “If there are no monkeys, for example, [the midges] will find another animal to bite,” says [Dr. Felipe Gomes Naveca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ygJj40QAAAAJ&hl=fr), a public health researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) who works with emergent and re-emerging viruses. And what makes it mysterious? Simply put: There’s a lot that researchers don’t know. There had been no reports of deaths from Oropouche in the last 69 years. But in 2024, two deaths of healthy young women have been confirmed in Brazil with a third death under investigation. What’s more, there are 8 [ suspected cases of vertical (mother to fetus) transmissions. Four of the infected ](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/saude/noticia/2024-08/saude-investiga-oito-casos-de-transmissao-vertical-de-oropouche)babies were born with congenital defects; the other four died. “Although the disease has historically been described as mild, the geographic spread in transmission and the detection of more severe cases underscore the need for increased surveillance and characterization of possible more severe manifestations,” read [PAHO’s statement](https://www.paho.org/en/news/2-8-2024-paho-urges-countries-strengthen-prevention-surveillance-and-diagnosis-oropouche-virus) on August 2. More severe cases can cause encephalitis and meningitis — inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membrane that can cause it to swell. How worried should we be? NPR posed that question to [Dr. Tulio de Oliveira](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=GHYG1ZMAAAAJ&hl=en), the director for the Center of Epidemic Response and Innovation at Stellenbosch University. He was in Brazil last week talking to public health officials and epidemiologists about Oropouche. “The Brazilian public health officials and scientists are, in my humble opinion, the best ones in the world to deal with an arbovirus outbreak,” de Oliveira said. “I didn't see any panic. I saw the opposite. I saw a lot of action happen on the ground to try to understand and try to control these outbreaks so it doesn’t become widespread.” But other countries that aren’t as used to dealing with a virus like Oropouche may have more difficulty curbing infections. Tulio de Oliveria says there is a potential for this virus to spread around the world. The death of the two women in Brazil also gives pause to public health researcher Dr. Naveca. He adds that there may be other cases of more severe symptoms from Oropouche that were perhaps attributed to dengue fever. And how do you know which virus you have? PCR tests for Oropouche are now widely available throughout Brazil, although that wasn’t the case earlier in the year. Naveca's additional concern: There is no vaccine for this virus, and creating one might be challenging because — like the flu — this virus is made up of several parts that can shift. If they do shift, it’s harder to target the virus with a shot. Dr. de Oliveria, who led the team that first detected the omicron variant of COVID-19 in South Africa, said one big question is the interaction between Oropouche and other viral infections, such as dengue and Zika. “The answer is that we do not know,” he says, “but what we do know is that many of these pathogens cause the worst clinical outcomes when they come in succession.” Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "text": "Viral\nTikTok Trend Of Adult Grandkids Surprising Grandparents With Sleepovers Is A Tearjerker\nGrab the tissues.\nEveryone is guilty of it: we don’t call our grandparents as much as we should, and visiting them, well, even less so. Chances are you remember the joys of staying the night at their house when you were little — maybe staying up a little late and having a big, homemade breakfast in the morning — and you know your grandma and grandpa treasure those memories. Now, adult grandchildren are taking it upon themselves, in a new viral TikTok trend, to surprise their grandparents with a sleepover, and wow are we so happy for all of these grandparents.\nIt’s not totally clear who started the trend or why, but around Christmas time, videos began popping up all over TikTok of adult grandkids filing into their grandparents houses, pillows and air mattresses in tow, to surprise them with a holiday slumber party.\nOne video from user Tori Hahlen (@hah_tor) has 8.4 million likes and nearly 524,000 saves, and is one of the most viral examples of the idea. In it, she and her six grown-up cousins walk into their grandparents house with brownies, presents, blankets, pillows, and what looks to be a bottle of Jameson. When they inform Grandma they’re staying the night and ordering pizza, she says, “This is the best Christmas present ever,” and breaks down in tears.\nIn\nanother video by TikTok user Jess Armstrong (@jessarmstrong19), so many grandkids walk through her Mimi and Papa’s front door that it’s hard to count just how many there are at first. Alongside the eight grown-up grandkids, it looks like one great-grandchild even made an appearance.\nArmstrong\ntold Good Morning America that her Papa has had some health concerns in the last year, so her cousins traveled from states away to her grandparents’ Michigan home to surprise them on Dec. 22. Good luck not tearing up at her grandfather’s reaction.\n“All night long, if the room got silent for a minute, he would tear up and he would just say, ‘I just can’t believe you guys did this. This is so exciting. This is the best present I could have ever asked for and I want you all to know I love each and every one of you so much,’” Armstrong told GMA. She says her family plans to make the adult sleepover an annual tradition.\nIf you feel like crying more happy tears and seeing more Nonnas, Poppies, Grannies, and Opas having their entire lives totally made, just search “grandparent sleepovers” on TikTok. In a crazy world with bad news around every corner, seeing so many families take this opportunity to love on their grandparents is a balm for the soul.",

    "text": "Janet Ogundepo The President, Bola Tinubu has promised to implement a new national living wage for Nigerian workers in 2024. He made this known in his first New Year speech to Nigerians on Monday. Tinubu promised to work diligently to make sure every Nigerian feels the impact of governance. He said, “The economic aspirations and the material well-being of the poor, the most vulnerable and the working people shall not be neglected. It is in this spirit that we are going to implement a new national living wage for our industrious workers this New Year. It is not only good economics to do this, it is also a morally and politically correct thing to do.” Following the removal of the fuel subsidy on May 29, 2023, the Federal Government in September, announced a N35,000 wage award for workers, which was meant to last for six months. In December, the PUNCH reported that the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Idris Mohammed, stated that the current N30,000 minimum wage would expire in March 2024, and a new wage regime would begin in April 2024. An analysis of the 2024-2026 Fiscal Framework budgets indicated that the Federal Government would spend N2.66tn on salaries from 2024 to 2026. Further speaking on his plans for Nigerians in the New Year, Tinubu explained that the fuel subsidy removal and the decision to float the naira against other currencies was to save the country from fiscal catastrophe. He, however, reassured that he was committed to improving the living conditions of Nigerians. Speaking on his plans for food security and supply, the president said, “To ensure constant food supply, security and affordability, we will step up our plan to cultivate 500,000 hectares of farmlands across the country to grow maize, rice, wheat, millet and other staple crops. We launched dry season farming with 120,000 hectares of land in Jigawa State last November under our National Wheat Development Programme.” He further stated that the events of the past seven months had laid the groundwork of economic recovery plans which would “accelerate the pace of our service delivery across sectors.” Tinubu also stated that the 2024 Budget prioritised national defence and internal security, job creation, macro-economic stability, investment environment optimisation, human capital development, poverty reduction and social security. “We will work diligently to make sure every Nigerian feels the impact of their government. The economic aspirations and the material well-being of the poor, the most vulnerable and the working people shall not be neglected. It is in this spirit that we are going to implement a new national living wage for our industrious workers this New Year. It is not only good economics to do this, it is also a morally and politically correct thing to do,” he noted. Tinubu further stated that plans were underway to ultimately deliver a steady electricity supply and promised the full operation of the Port Harcourt and Dangote Refinery. He pledged to fight every obstacle that impedes business competitiveness in the country. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.

    "text": "Um reforço de peso está de volta para a competição mais esperada do Espírito Santo. Em 2025, o Campeonato Capixaba será novamente conhecido como “Capixabão Superbet”.\nA marca patrocinou a competição no ano passado, e firmou com a Federação de Futebol do Estado do Espírito Santo (FES) um novo contrato de patrocínio com naming rights.\n“É com grande alegria que anunciamos a renovação do contrato com a Superbet, uma parceria de sucesso, que começou em 2024. Com isso, trazemos mais recursos para a nossa competição e para nossos filiados. Nossa expectativa para o Capixabão Superbet é muito alta, temos dez grandes equipes na disputa pelo título e pelas vagas nas competições nacionais”, afirma o presidente da FES, Gustavo Vieira.\nGustavo também lembra que a parceria de integridade esportiva com a Rei do Pitaco continua. Por isso, todas as competições profissionais da FES são monitoradas pela Sportradar.\nOutra notícia importante sobre o Capixabão Superbet, que começa neste sábado (18), é a estreia da Central do VAR. O projeto inovador executado pela FES e sua Comissão Estadual de Arbitragem (CEAF-ES), em parceria com a TVE Espírito Santo. Pela primeira vez no Estado, o equipamento de árbitro de vídeo (VAR) será operado sempre do mesmo lugar, em uma sala própria na sede da TVE. O mesmo acontece em competições nacionais da Confederação Brasileira de Futebol (CBF).\nA novidade entra em campo já nesta primeira rodada, em duas partidas que acontecem em Cariacica: no clássico entre Desportiva Ferroviária e Vitória, no estádio Engenheiro Araripe, às 17h deste sábado (18), e no duelo entre Porto Vitória e Real Noroeste, no Kleber Andrade, às 19h de segunda-feira (20).\nNo sábado (18), também tem Nova Venécia SAF contra Rio Branco AC SAF, às 15h, no estádio Zenor Pedrosa, em Nova Venécia. No domingo (19), o Rio Branco FC recebe o Vilavelhense no Olímpio Perim, em Venda Nova do Imigrante. Jaguaré e Capixaba SC medem forças na segunda-feira (20), às 16h, no estádio Conilon.\nAlém de ir aos estádios, os torcedores podem acompanhar a cobertura completa da TVE, que novamente transmite todas as partidas do campeonato. Alguns jogos também serão transmitidos nacionalmente pela TV Brasil, que vai utilizar o conteúdo gerado pela tv pública dos capixabas.\nO Capixabão Superbet vale o sonhado título estadual e vagas para competições nacionais de 2026: duas para a Copa do Brasil (campeão e vice-campeão) e uma para a Série D do Campeonato Brasileiro (campeão). Além disso, quem levantar a taça também pode ir à Copa Verde do ano que vem, o que ainda depende de confirmação da CBF.\nNa primeira fase, os dez times participantes se enfrentam em turno único. Os oito melhores avançam para as quartas de final, já os dois últimos colocados serão rebaixados para a segunda divisão estadual. As três fases do mata-mata (quartas de final, semifinais e finais) serão disputadas em jogos de ida e volta. As finais estão previstas para os dias 29 de março e 05 de abril.",
