    "title": "Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists | York Press",
    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "title": "In 2023, Pittsburgh and Allegheny county news overflowed — and the shelters did, too",
    "text": "During this holiday season, around 900 people are known to be sleeping outside or in shelters in Allegheny County. Housing and homelessness were ever-present concerns in the Pittsburgh region this year. But even as tents went up and shelters swung shut, new leadership came knocking on the doors of power with pledges of responsiveness and equity. With COVID-driven funding expiring fast, though, the long-haul effects of the pandemic may be just beginning for the city, the Pittsburgh Public Schools and other local institutions. In so many areas of life in our region — education, environment, equity, public health and safety — the gears of history continued to turn, and sometimes to grind, in 2023. PublicSource highlighted emerging trends and dug deep into the data, documentation and human-level impact. Here are some of the stories we reported, many of which will echo into 2024 and beyond. The year 2022 closed with the City of Pittsburgh removing an encampment along Stockton Avenue on East Allegheny’s edge and sweeping aside with it a longstanding agreement. The tents went down just as Allegheny County’s new Second Avenue Commons shelter prepared to accept displaced people while the Smithfield United Church of Christ’s basement doors creaked open. If anybody thought those developments would noticeably blunt the effects of the housing crisis, they were quickly disabused of that notion. The early days of Second Avenue Commons were marked by staffing problems and safety questions , while this autumn saw ramped-up evictions from its single room occupancy units. The Smithfield shelter, meanwhile, became a haven for hundreds but a bugaboo for Downtown businesses, until its June closure demonstrated just how tattered America’s safety net has become. “I understand that it can’t exist indefinitely, but this haphazard closure is going to cause death and we need to hold people accountable for that.” With cold weather’s return came a slow-motion rollout of the county’s and city’s plan for emergency shelter. The persistent presence of at least 200 people on the street, though, left leaders looking for… The affordable housing shortage has been well documented for at least a decade , though never so viscerally evident as it was in 2023. Yet one of the most versatile tools for addressing housing needs — the Housing Choice (Section 8) Voucher — had become rusty and blunt by the time PublicSource documented concerns of landlords, tenants and former Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh [HACP] insiders. That reporting spurred pledges of prompt improvements in customer service in the program, but the year ended with curbs on the portability of vouchers . “This is coming at the cost of tenants losing their apartments. Landlords don’t get payments, and they don’t stick it out. They’re forced to let their tenants go.” City development officials, meanwhile, scrambled to preserve affordable units that might otherwise fall into disrepair or convert to market-rate status. A $50 million federal grant raised hopes for more and better Hill District homes. County-level interests sought to bring to the boroughs some of the models that have taken root in the city. And after nearly a decade of inactivity, the Pittsburgh Land Bank slowly began the process of reclaiming abandoned city property, sidestepping legal obstacles that held up progress. While fears of gentrification have been most pronounced in Pittsburgh, housing market forces don’t stop at the city line. That’s why Sara Innamorato was quizzed about the issue during her successful run for county executive, which has everybody asking … In what will be the last Allegheny County election season to feature direct six-figure contributions to candidates, Democrat Innamorato barely overcame Republican Joe Rockey’s large fundraising edge. (Conversely, District Attorney Stephen Zappala ran as a Republican, and bested billionaire-backed Democrat Matt Dugan.) “I don’t think it is fair for a few stakeholder groups and individuals to tip the scales for the most influential elected position in this region.” Innamorato’s pledge to focus on the “ struggle of everyday people ” has a different feel from outgoing County Executive Rich Fitzgerald ’s recent emphases, which have tended toward consensus building with business, labor and multiple levels of government, plus stable property taxes. Innamorato has said she’d like to address increasingly skewed assessments , but also wants to reduce a reassessment’s impact on those least able to afford tax hikes. “By us not taking action and coming up with some sort of regular, consistent [reassessment] system, we’re exacerbating inequality.” Innamorato also heard “alarm bells” in the county’s selection of nonprofit contractor Adelphoi to take over the Shuman Juvenile Detention Center. But she will become executive amid heightened attention to violent crime, which the county has sought to address with a $50 million effort to beef up prevention efforts. That’s a lot on the plate of the likely most prominent member of what we’ll call … Innamorato follows political ally Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey to Grant Street, but also joins dozens of new leaders who replaced longtime executives in both the public and private realms. “Either we’re exhausted, the job had gotten too hard or we were reexamining priorities for how we wanted to spend our time.” Also reaching prominence this year were Pittsburgh Police Chief Larry Scirotto (who promptly disappointed some accountability advocates ) and University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Joan Gabel (whose statements on Israel and Gaza left some dissatisfied). The three years of turnover at the top that followed the Great Resignation may be remembered as a pivot point for the Pittsburgh region, but it won’t likely herald an extended and unanimous chorus of Kumbaya. Exhibit one: Gainey and UPMC (now led by Leslie Davis) show no signs of reaching an accord on any obligations the healthcare giant may have to the city’s coffers. “I can’t understand why billions can’t pay a little bit.” And the city’s bank balance? It’s likely to get leaner , as federal American Rescue Plan Act funds run dry. Gainey won’t be the only local leader scrambling for funds because … The Pittsburgh Public Schools are expecting similar headwinds as relief funding dries up and costs mount. To get through the next budget year, PPS needs to draw nearly $30 million from its depleting rainy day fund. But even then, glaring inequalities persist, with students in some schools feeling they’re being taught in a “playground” instead of a rigorous educational setting. “We can’t expect people to have faith in the public education system when the public education system keeps failing the communities.” The district also faces challenges over disparate student outcomes, variable teaching quality and uneven costs maintaining a patchwork of buildings that far exceed the needs of a shrinking student pool. Graduates of high schools in Pittsburgh and suburban districts may be wise to review university balance sheets before filling out applications as … Higher education fairs little better in a city that’s hinged its revival on an “eds and meds” economy. Many newer workforce entrants are questioning the value of a degree altogether. The Community College of Allegheny County lost about half of its student body between 2010 and 2022 – and even a steep drop since the 2020 pandemic doesn’t account for the whole picture, one of steady decline. “The budget crisis really underscored how powerless we are, how little transparency there is in decision-making that affects our future, and how much we really desire to have some stability and a voice in the process.” Alarm bells rang out from Chatham University’s sedate Squirrel Hill campus in summer, when faculty learned the university faced a $12 million budget hole. To close the gap, President Rhonda Philips laid off department staff, trimmed administration salaries and slashed faculty pension contributions. Chatham faculty answered with an early unionizing effort they hope will strengthen their position as the administration seeks to patch its deficit. That push can be viewed as one of many efforts aimed at … Campus concerns early in the year were focused primarily on safety for LGBTQ students , and when Pitt’s response wasn’t satisfying, an effort to bring the issue before the Board of Trustees resulted in criminal charges and student conduct hearings . At Duquesne University, a bid to rename Lambda to the Queer Student Union stagnated amid ongoing tension between the school’s Catholic orientation and the growing push for LGBTQ inclusion. Nearly every university is grappling with diversity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision ending affirmative action in admissions. “If colleges lose the ability to consider race, then I think one thing that happens is we take a step backwards in terms of creating a fairer society.” That ruling was also seen as a potential warning shot for other programs meant to undo effects of discrimination, and lent some urgency to the Gainey administration’s pledge to refresh the data behind race-conscious programs. Equitable law enforcement remained a work in progress, too, as a mayor elected in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police didn’t immediately dent the racial skew of his own department’s activities , or make “ driving while Black ” a thing of the past. Equity efforts increasingly overlap with the ongoing environmental and climate catastrophe, and nowhere is that more newsworthy than in … Pollution from coal, manufacturing and other fossil fuels continues to plague a region still trying to shrug off the nickname “Smoky City.” After Shell Chemical Appalachia opened its giant new petrochemical plant in Beaver County, a PublicSource investigation revealed a litany of malfunctions where, in many cases, the Department of Environmental Protection largely relied on Shell to assess its own missteps and the validity of public complaints. In October, the Biden administration announced funding for two hydrogen hubs spanning stretches of Pennsylvania, although a proposal centered around Pittsburgh did not make the cut. Opinion is fiercely split on whether hydrogen has a role in the transition to clean energy or merely extends our fossil fuel dependence. “I have enough chemicals in me to be living right down on that pad.” To some, natural gas extracted through fracking offers another pathway to weaning off coal and its carbon-heavy cousins. But families living less than 900 feet from a well pad in Washington County say their health and quality of life has suffered accordingly, while state legislation to keep drilling away from homes fell flat this summer. Climate change and air quality are daunting big-picture problems, and if you’re yearning to feel good about humanity, it might be advisable to look at … If the arc of history bends toward justice, the end of that rainbow can seem elusive — but perhaps it will end in the Hill District. The neighborhood is still wary about developer promises after witnessing one of urban renewal’s most infamous injustices when the city razed the Lower Hill District and built the Civic Arena and parking lots. But leadership at the Bethel AME Church, victimized by the wrecking ball in 1957, believe they have a pact that will partly redress that tragedy with affordable housing . “We devote this land to end white supremacy, capitalism, racism and all other isms that bring division.” Similarly, Wilkinsburg’s population losses created both a need for redevelopment and fear of gentrification. The apparent collapse of a push to merge the borough into Pittsburgh may invite civic leaders to build on the community’s strengths . “We’ve watched things decline over the years, there’s this sense that nothing can be done and there are no future plans. I think that now that we have some new people coming in, it’s starting to build up that hope again.” Pittsburgh’s growth depends on its embrace of diversity and its willingness to welcome newcomers, and nowhere was that more evident than in Beechview . The South Pittsburgh neighborhood hosts the biggest concentration of Latino residents in the region, and its business district — once crippled by disinvestment and fraud — features what may be the region’s most bilingual main street. As PublicSource enters its 13th year of writing, photographing and otherwise pursuing stories for a better Pittsburgh, there’s plenty of room for improvement — in the region and the media. Also ample is the spirit of determination to solve problems, whether they’re as concrete as the shortage of affordable housing or as intangible as equity in education.

    "text": "Rafa Mir respondeu a adeptos nas redes sociais, que o criticavam pelas suas exibições\nDepois de uma época atribulada, mas que terminou com a conquista da Liga Europa , o Sevilha está novamente num período complicado e alguns dos seus jogadores têm sido bastante criticados.\nRafa Mir é um deles, tendo até entrado em discussões com adeptos nas redes sociais: «É um escândalo ver como jogas», dizem eles. «E eu nem se quer joguei, imagina quando me meterem um pouco em campo», respondeu o avançado. A discussão não terminou ali e o espanhol defendeu-se de forma curiosa: «Tenho mais minutos e ritmo na cozinha do que em campo.»\nEsta temporada o jogador participou em 17 partidas, embora apenas quatro delas a titular, tendo feito dois golos. O Sevilha, que recentemente contratou o ex-técnico do Benfica , Quique Flores, leva quatro derrotas nos últimos cinco jogos e está em 15.º na La Liga . O clube também já foi eliminado das competições europeias, tendo terminado em último lugar no seu grupo de Liga dos Campeões , atrás de Arsenal , PSV e Lens .\n18 dezembro 2023, 14:58\nQuique Flores é o novo treinador do Sevilha Ex-Benfica assume o comando do clube espanhol até 2025",

    "text": "Cientos de brasileños y algunas leyendas de la Canarinha despidieron a Mário Jorge Lobo Zagallo, el único con cuatro Copas del Mundo en el universo del futbol, quien falleció el viernes y fue sepultado este domingo en Río de Janeiro.\nEl “Viejo Lobo”, quien tenía la salud quebrantada desde hace una década, falleció la medianoche del pasado viernes a los 92 años en un hospital de Río de Janeiro, ciudad en la que comenzó su carrera en el futbol como punta izquierda del club América de Brasil.\nEl velatorio fue en la sede de la Confederación Brasileña de Fútbol (CBF), cuya fachada lucía un cartel en el que se leía “Zagallo Eterno”, una frase con “13 letras”, el número preferido del “Viejo Lobo”, quien admitía ser supersticioso como pocos.\nJunto al ataúd, una estatua de cera de 1,70 metros, su altura, que lo muestra con su uniforme de entrenador, y las cinco Copas del Mundo obtenidas por Brasil, de las cuales cuatro fueron ganadas por selecciones que tuvieron al “Viejo Lobo” entre sus integrantes.\nFueron en Suecia 1958 y Chile 1962 como jugador, en México 1970 como entrenador y en Estados Unidos 1994 como coordinador técnico de Alberto Parreira.\nPese a la importancia de Zagallo, pocas personalidades del futbol comparecieron. Entre ellos, Zinho, Grafite, Mazinho, Gilmar Rinaldi, Mauro Silva, Cafú y Bebeto, exjugadores de la selección brasileña y que en algún momento tuvieron a Zagallo como entrenador.\nBebeto, quien brilló en España con Deportivo La Coruña y Sevilla, recordó a Zagallo como “un tipo que nunca se desanimaba” y afirmó que su “mayor referencia y maestro” en el futbol.\n“Un tipo siempre positivo, que contagiaba en el vestuario” y “alentaba a sus jugadores como nadie”, agregó Bebeto, campeón mundial en Estados Unidos 1994.\nTambién estuvieron el exseleccionador y actual entrenador de Flamengo Adenor Leonardo Bachi “Tite”, junto a directivos de los clubes Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense y Vasco da Gama, los cuatro grandes de Río de Janeiro en los que Zagallo actuó como jugador o técnico.\nEl presidente de la CBF, Ednaldo Rodrigues, valoró el “gigantesco legado” de Zagallo para el futbol mundial y anunció que la entidad preparará “una serie de homenajes” para “honrar su memoria” durante todo este año.\nTras el velatorio, el ataúd, cubierto con banderas de la CBF, la FIFA y la Conmebol, fue transportado en un camión de Bomberos hasta el cementerio São João Batista, en el barrio de Botafogo.\nAllí, esas tres banderas fueron sustituidas por una de Brasil y el “Viejo Lobo” fue sepultado en una ceremonia reservada para sus familiares y amigos más íntimos, que lo despidieron con una larga salva de aplausos.\n(Con información de EFE)",
