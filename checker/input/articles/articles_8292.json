    "title": "Etats-Unis : les salariés de Boeing votent la grève à une écrasante majorité",
    "text": "Jon Holden, le président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751, s’adresse aux médias après le vote de la grève chez Boeing, à Seattle, le 12 septembre. JASON REDMOND / AFP Nouvelle difficulté pour l’avionneur américain dans une situation déjà difficile. Les salariés de Boeing de la région de Seattle, dans le nord-ouest des Etats-Unis, ont voté à une très large majorité en faveur d’une grève dès vendredi 13 septembre, rejetant la nouvelle convention proposée par leur entreprise, a annoncé leur syndicat. Les travailleurs ont rejeté la convention à 94,6 % et voté jeudi soir la grève à 96 %, a précisé Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751, qui représente environ 33 000 travailleurs dans le nord-est du Pacifique.\nLa grève entraînera la fermeture de deux grandes usines d’assemblage dans la région de Puget Sound. Elle va paralyser la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards. Une situation d’autant plus problématique que l’avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60 %) à la remise des avions.\nEn dépit du vote massif en faveur de la grève, le Groupe Boeing a déclaré dans un communiqué être « engagé » dans la négociation. « Nous restons déterminés à rétablir nos relations avec nos employés et le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord » , a affirmé l’avionneur.\nMultitude de problèmes de qualité Selon les travailleurs, l’accord proposé était bien moins généreux que l’affirmaient les dirigeants. Cette nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents de l’IAM du secteur de Seattle, prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25 % sur quatre ans ainsi qu’un engagement d’investissements dans la région. Et aussi la construction du prochain avion – annoncé pour 2035 – dans le berceau historique de l’avionneur qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.\nBoeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève, alors que sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019, ayant coûté la vie à 346 personnes, et une multitude de problèmes de qualité de la production. « Ce n’est un secret pour personne : notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (…) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune » , avait prévenu mercredi soir Kelly Ortberg, qui a succédé le 8 août à Dave Calhoun au poste de directeur général de l’avionneur américain. Il avait exhorté les employés à ne pas « sacrifier » les progrès futurs en raison de « frustrations liées au passé » .\nLes mécontents jugent toutefois la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+ 40 % initialement) et le volet sur les retraites, insatisfaisant. Une semaine après sa prise de fonction, M. Ortberg s’était engagé à « réinitialiser » la relation avec l’IAM. Mais à la lecture de l’accord, de nombreux syndiqués ont réagi négativement et plaidé pour un arrêt de travail.\nBoeing fait l’objet d’une supervision accrue depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d’Alaska Airlines . Survenu après une série de problèmes de conformité et de contrôle qualité, il a ravivé les questions soulevées sur ces mêmes lacunes après les deux crashes.\nLa dernière grève chez l’avionneur américain remonte à 2008 et avait duré cinquante-sept jours. Selon les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de cinquante jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d’affaires.\nLe Monde avec AFP\nRéutiliser ce contenu",

    "title": "Milestone As 98 Pc of Villages Successfully Electrified - MarketScreener",
    "text": "In a significant milestone of rural transformation, the Rural Energy Agency (REA) has successfully electrified 98 per cent of all villages across the country.\nSuch great stride in the energy sector is in line with the ruling party CCM's 2020-2025 Election Manifesto, which directs the government to supply electricity to all streets and villages by 2025.\nWith one year ahead to the deadline, the sixth phase government under President Samia Suluhu Hassan is on track to beat the envisioned goal of connecting all villages with electricity infrastructure, which is critical in elevating citizens' living standard.\nThe REA Director of Rural Electrification , Engineer Jones Olotu\ntold the 'Daily News' in an exclusive interview in Dar es Salaam recently that as of July this year the power agency connected with electricity a total of 12,031 villages, equivalent to 98 per cent of all villages. He said currently, only 287 villages are not connected with power, noting they will be connected to power in September this year.\nHe said that a total 8,247 villages had already been connected with electricity, equivalent to 66 per cent by 2020.\nAnd, REA has been implementing a five years grand plan of electrifying the remaining 4,071 villages that would see all 12,318 villages countrywide linked with power by next year.\nREA ambitious plan is aligned with the ruling party CCM's Election Manifesto 2020-2025 and the Third National Five-Year Development Plan covering 2021/2022 to 2025/2026 (Third FYDP) that aims at guiding the country's efforts towards the attainment of the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, all together intend on among others to achieve a middle-income, competitive and semi-industrialised economy with shared growth and high-quality human development.\n\"We are ahead of the manifesto as by September this year, which is before its time limit (2025), we are going to realise electrification of all villages,\" Mr Olotu\nsaid. He said availability of electricity in rural areas has been boosting citizens' income by enabling them open new economic activities such as shops and kiosks, groceries, restaurants and hair cutting and beauty salons.\nALSO READ: PURA set to announce new oil, gas exploration opportunities\nFurthermore, it improved domestic activities like lighting, charging phones and listening to radio, he said adding it also made life easier and more pleasurable by allowing businesses and kiosks to function even during the night hours.\nOn the other hand electricity supported children's education by allowing them to study at night, he said and noted it enabled villagers to receive health services closer to their homes and at a lower cost.\nThe next step ahead, he said REA's focus is to ensure electricity reaches all hamlets and households referring to the fact that presently, only 32, 827 hamlets equated at 51 per cent have power, while 31,532 others are yet to be connected.\nHe said the rural energy body has another five years electrification plan spanning from the current 2024/2025 Financial Year aiming at lighting 20,000 hamlets at a cost of about 6tri/-.\nMr Olotu\ndetailed that REA projected to connect 4,000 hamlets per year. The country has a total of 64,359 hamlets. \"Up to now, we are undertaking procurements for implementation of the first batch within the current financial year. Few days to come, we will announce tenders for contractors to be located to specific hamlets,\" he said.\nToward national wide households' electrification, according to the Third FYDP, the country targets at ensuring 60 per cent of all households are connected with power by the end of 2025/2026 FY from 40 per cent lighted in 2021/2022.\nHe lauded the government for implementation of the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Plant (JNHPP) project that after its completion is expected to add 2,115 megawatts (MW) into the national grid, critical in stabilising electricity supply in the country and beyond.\nIn February 2024 , the project injected 235MW into the national grid after a switching on of its ninth turbine that strengthened electricity availability both in urban and rural areas.\nA villager, Mr Peter Nzema (30) based in Bukumbi village, Shinyanga Region commended the government for connecting their rural community with electricity.\nHe said their village was connected in 2023 ending over five decades of living in dark without electricity.\nHe said prior to being connected with electricity their village's economic activities were paralysed with no any factory in comparison to now whereby a maize mill has been established by a local investor.\nMore significantly, he said the Bukumbi village experiences some sort of urbanisation, as a result of residents who take initiative to open up saloons and shops.\n\"It is just a beginning of transformation of the village that for so long time we used to dream one day to have electricity,\" Mr Nzema said.\nHowever, he noted that there is a slow pace in connecting the hamlets existing in their villages.\n\"It's okay that the electricity has reached our village but the number of households connected remains less than 10, the power has not been distributed to our residential area as we hoped,\" he said, adding \"We are ready to pay.\"\nMr Nzema told Daily news if REA starts to connect households in their village, it will enable small farmers including himself who choose to undertake irrigation especially in vegetable and fruit crops including tomatoes and water melon to scale up production.\n\"Small scale farmers who adopt irrigation are eager to see their households and hamlets are connected with electricity to get rid of using diesel powered generators, which make them incur high cost of production,\" he said.\nReacting on the on-going rural electrification, Economist cum Investment Banker, Dr Hildebrand Shayo\nanticipated that the transformative move will directly affect, positively though, the commercial sector through the use of specific electrical appliances encompassing refrigerators. Furthermore, he said presence of electric lights will facilitate residents to extend working hours, subsequently propelling the country's development.\n\"Electrification in rural areas may result in to increases in daytime working hours and noticeable increases in evening and night time working hour,\" Dr Shayo\nsaid. Dr Shayo\nsaid in his ongoing research on Economic Impact of Rural Electrification in Tanzania , he found that the number of shops per 1,000 people in electrified villages is 4.28, compared to 3.43 in nonelectrified villages, a roughly 25 per cent difference. Regarding institutional development, he said that electrified villages in several case study areas have much greater levels of institutional development.\n\"I can assert that it dramatically improves the general standard of living in rural areas, lowers rural-urban migration, increases industrial and agricultural production, and produces more jobs\" Dr Shayo\nremarked. Ms Betty Mbuzi, a resident at Mwatulole Street in Geita Region said she was optimistic that electrification all villages in their region will catalyse mining activities involving artisanal miners in their region which is endowed with minerals.\nShe noted that lack of electricity in some villages while others are connected with it culminate into energy divide.\nCopyright 2024 Tanzania Daily News.

According to his plea agreement, Hill frequently pocketed some or all of the business' daily cash receipts rather than putting them into a safe deposit box.\nHill tried to conceal his actions by using cash received at a later time to cover past thefts, \"thereby creating the false impression that deposits were delayed rather than stolen,\" according to the plea agreement. He also sent regular emails to Chik-fil-a's accounting personnel in Illinois representing that he was belatedly depositing cash from earlier dates.\nAccording to Hill's February indictment , he spent the money on online sports betting, jewelry and OnlyFans, a subscription-based website known for sexually explicit content that includes celebrity performers. Hill also sent tens of thousands of dollars to various people, including several female airport workers in exchange for \"personal photos and videos.\"\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson has not yet scheduled a sentencing date for Hill.",

    "text": "最新气候变化研究：2020年出生人群或将更频繁遭遇极端气候事件 分享到： → 分享到： 最新气候变化研究：2020年出生人群或将更频繁遭遇极端气候事件 2025-05-08 11:09:19 来源： 中国新闻网 作者：刘湃 责任编辑：刘湃 2025年05月08日 11:09　来源： 中国新闻网 大字体 小字体 分享到： 　　 中新网 北京5月8日电 (记者 孙自法)国际知名学术期刊《自然》最新发表一篇气候变化研究论文称，分析显示，在1.5°C升温情景下，2020年出生的人群中约52%将面临前所未有的热浪暴露风险，而1960年出生的人群中这一比例仅为16%。\n　　这项研究结果表明，气候危机的负担将主要由年轻世代而非年长世代承担，强调了减缓温室气体排放以减轻气候变化对年轻世代影响的紧迫性。\n　　该论文介绍，随着气候持续变暖，人类面临的极端气候事件(包括热浪、作物减产和干旱)将日益加剧，年轻世代将比年长世代更频繁地遭遇此类极端事件。然而，在不同气候变暖路径下，不同年份出生且具有不同社会经济脆弱性的人群面临此类极端气候事件暴露风险的具体规模仍不明确。\n本项研究成果示意图表。施普林格·自然 供图 　　在本项研究中，论文第一作者兼通讯作者、比利时布鲁塞尔自由大学Luke Grant和同事及合作者一起，在全球范围内对不同气候变暖路径下一生中遭遇前所未有的极端事件的暴露情况进行了预测。“前所未有”的暴露定义为在没有人为导致气候变化的世界中，遭遇相同极端事件的概率小于万分之一。此次研究发现，与1960年出生的人相比，2020年出生的人在当前减缓政策下(目标为到2100年全球气温较工业革命前升高2.7°C)的暴露风险将翻倍。他们指出，全球1960年出生者中约16%(1300万人)将面临前所未有的终生热浪暴露风险。与此同时，如果全球变暖到2100年比工业革命前水平升高1.5°C，2020年出生的人中约52%(6200万人)将经历前所未有的热浪暴露风险，如果升温达到3.5°C，这一比例将升至92%。\n　　进一步将分析范围扩展至五个额外气候极端事件(作物减产、野火、干旱、河流洪水和热带气旋)以及热浪后，论文作者发现，在所有极端事件中，暴露程度均会随出生年份推移而明显升高。他们补充指出，在当前政策下，每个出生队列中社会经济地位最脆弱的群体比最不脆弱的群体，更可能面临更高程度的气候极端事件暴露。\n　　《自然》同期发表同行专家的“新闻与观点”文章认为，该研究虽然存在一些局限性，例如分析未考虑人口在国家边界内的流动以及生育率和死亡率的趋势。不过，其研究结果强调，制定有效策略以减少未来温室气体排放以保护未来世代的必要性。(完)",
