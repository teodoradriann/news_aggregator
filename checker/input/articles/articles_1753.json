    "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - On one of the coldest days this winter, hundreds gathered outside City Hall in Burlington to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nProtestors chanted for a free Palestine, condemning U.S. aid to Israel and Burlington City Council’s recent standstill on a ceasefire resolution . There were old and new faces in the crowd. It was University of Vermont freshman Lilly Patton’s first Free Palestine rally.\n“I think it was time I step in and also support it,” Patton said.\nBurlington resident Emma Kouri came with her daughter and her friends. Kouri says she wanted to go beyond simply discussing the conflict.\n“There’s a lot of talk about what’s happening and awareness but I don’t feel like there’s enough of a push as there should be and really us putting our physical bodies out there on the line to support the community,” Kouri said.\nOver three months since Hamas attacked Israel, local organizers say the Free Palestine movement is growing.\nWafic Faour with Vermonters for Justice in Palestine is the backbone of the local movement. He’s noticed more people getting involved and educating themselves since the initial attack.\n“Our movement in Burlington here is in hundreds and hundreds and we’re hearing from many people and quarters and organization that for the longest time we never heard from,” Faour reflected.\nFaour hopes people think beyond the protest, writing their representatives and boycotting companies that support Israel.\nThe rally ended with a march past TD Bank, under fire for holding millions in stocks in General Dynamics, an aerospace and weapons company supplying Israel’s army. Organizers say next up is a rally on Monday ahead of Burlington City Council’s final vote on a ceasefire resolution.\n ",

    "text": "Summary:\n- CoreWeave (\nCRWV,Financial) saw a significant uptick in stock value post-IPO, despite an underwhelming initial launch. - BlackBerry (BB) stock fell as the company forecasts a drop in annual revenue.\n- Trump Media & Technology Group looks at potential stock sales, while NewsMax (NMAX) experiences a sharp decline after a strong post-IPO surge.\nCoreWeave's Post-IPO Performance\nCoreWeave (CRWV) has captured investors' attention with a remarkable climb in stock value, following its initial public offering. Despite a modest debut, the rally suggests strong investor interest and an optimistic outlook for the company's future prospects. As market dynamics shift, CoreWeave seems poised to leverage its strategic initiatives to maintain momentum.\nBlackBerry's Revenue Forecast and Stock Impact\nIn a contrasting narrative, BlackBerry (BB) shares witnessed a decline after the company revised its annual revenue projections downward. The anticipated decrease is attributed to reduced spending on cybersecurity solutions, which has impacted investor confidence. BlackBerry's pivot may indicate broader market trends affecting the cybersecurity industry.\nTrump Media & Technology Group Evaluates Stock Sale\nMeanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group faced a downturn as it filed documents potentially paving the way for the sale of President Trump's stake in the company. This move might significantly alter the ownership landscape, with potential implications for future stock performance and shareholder value.\nNewsMax's Stock Volatility Post-IPO\nNewsMax (NMAX) experienced pronounced stock volatility, characterized by a sharp decline following an impressive rise after its IPO. This pattern underscores the unpredictable nature of post-IPO trading, raising questions about the company's long-term market stability and investor sentiment.",

(WSMV) - Firefighters were able to rescue residents from an assisted living tower in Murfreesboro after a fire in the tower’s laundry room. Murfreesboro Fire Rescue said crews went floor to floor assisting residents out of the Westbrook Towers after a laundry room fire sent smoke billowing through the building on Friday morning. First responders were alerted of the fire at the seven-story building on N. Walnut Street at just before 10:30 a.m. Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire and contain it in the laundry room. No injuries were reported. “Fire crews went throughout the building several times assisting about a third of the residents, some using wheelchairs and walkers, with getting out safely. Many others left the building when the fire alarm sounded. Some residents sheltered in place in stairways where there was no smoke,” MFRD said. A nearby center, St. Clair Senior Center opened its doors for residents to escape the heat outside. After the building was cleared of smoke, all those evacuated were able to return. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Copyright 2024 WSMV. All rights reserved.",

Víctima de persecución por el franquismo, por su decidido antinazismo y su reticencia con el régimen, también lo fue por prostituir a mujeres.\nEtiquetas\nfidel garcía martínez\nmemorandum\nobispo\nfranco\npederastia\nmenéalo\n3\nDE3C548D-E347-406A-A60F-E6BBD322CAB7\n10\n0\nCopiar enlace\nCompartir en X\nCompartir en facebook\nCompartir en telegram\nEmbed\nVoto negativo\nMás información\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-ROBA1 –>\nComunidad destacada de hoy\nGastronomia\nRecetas, restaurantes, gourmet\nG\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-MEGA1 –>\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-ROBA1 –>\nLoguéate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
