    "text": "Electricity provision is poor in Rojava, due to war-damage and scarcity of fuel. Turkish bombardments have destroyed the power grid. European-style refrigerators require large solar systems that cost the equivalent of a year’s income or more. The absence of adequate cooling systems has detrimental effects on the quality of life. Meanwhile, alternatives that are associated with historical methods are unpopular: any technology that falls outside Euro-American visions of the future tends to be perceived as “primitive”.\nRevolution Refridge responds to this: Firstly, the device combines historical, vaporization-based cooling with a contemporary solar system. Secondly, its design suggests an alternative, regionalist futurity, fusing sci-fi idioms with regional heritage. The unit shape is inspired by space exploration rockets and historical regional architecture. Covered in fragments of Kurdish carpets, its golden color connects to both traditional jewelry and high-tech circuitry.\nBio\n-\nRojava Center for Democratic Technologies\nSY\nThe Rojava Center for Democratic Technologies is formed by a fluid group of artists and engineers working in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), Initiated by Dutch artist and cultural critic Dani Ploeger, it combines art and engineering to develop visions and practices for a postcolonial technological future built on the principles of the Rojava Revolution: socialist anarchism for stateless governance, gender equality, cooperative labor and ecology.\nCredits\nThe development of Revolution Refridge has been supported by the University of Rojava and The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London\nPresented in the context of the STARTS Ec(h)o project.

    "text": "\"In an early spring we see the appearing buds;Which to prove fruit, hope gives not so much warrant as despairThat frosts will bite them.\"King Henry IV, Part 2: I: 3. I'm just like Lord Bardolph, who was afraid that just as soon as the new buds start to show, a cold spell will come along and \"bite\" them. The season now is hard to figure: is it late winter or early spring? Lots of folks, especially those of us with a bad case of cabin-fever, want to lean toward the latter, and surely there are already plenty of buds — and opening flowers — visible on our landscape. It has been a relatively mild winter here in the South, at least where I live, certainly not an “old-time” winter like many people have had. And there are a lot of newly-appearing floral delights. These red flowers are produced by the millions, on trees. It is a native species that is common all over the southern states, and indeed, it gets all the way up through New England, to southern Canada. This tree (Red maple, Acer rubrum ) is as much at home on high ground as it is in our deepest swamps. It doesn't mind having its feet wet, and the base of the trunk will commonly be submerged during spring floods, with no harm done. Otherwise, it is common as well in our sandhills and mountain forests. This species is probably much more common these days than it was before Europeans showed up. In fact, ecologists wonder that maybe its success, over that 300 years or so, is a result of forest disturbance and a general lack of fire. And, it may be that the overwhelming success of this native species might not be good news for other natives, including oaks and hickories. Those of you with horses need to know that the foliage can be toxic if eaten, especially if the leaves have been damaged. It might be a good idea to make sure this tree is not overhanging your pasture fence. The bark is beautiful, gray and smooth, although on big individuals the bark becomes fissured and split. The leaves are roughly three-lobed, somewhat resembling what you'll see on the flag of Canada. As they unfold, the leaves may be bright red, eventually greening up on the top, and with a much paler lower surface. In the fall, the leaves turn red again: it's one of our nicest species for autumn color. Additionally, this species, which is related to the famous sugar maple, has itself been used as a source of syrup. Back to the flowers, though. An individual tree will generally have only male flowers, as in this photo, producing plenty of pollen, or female flowers, which eventually produce red, winged, one-seeded fruits. Whether male or female, the individual flowers tend to be fairly inconspicuous. But when massed together, the trees take on a pink or red hue, which is hard to miss. This floral display is especially prominent in swampy habitats, easy to notice if you are cruising down the road at 55 mph: that's what that reddish-pink haze is in the woods. (PS.

    "title": "Violent crime rates decrease significantly in Philadelphia for 2023, says Interim Commissioner John Stanford and DA Larry Krasner - WPVI-TV",
    "text": "Homicides are now down more than 20%, non-fatal shootings are down 28%, and violent crime is down roughly 7%. PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Violent crime is down across the board this year in Philadelphia, according to city data. But the Interim Commissioner John Stanford, as well as others in law enforcement officials, said more still needs to be done. \"I don't think anybody would have expected us to be this far down,\" said Stanford. The interim police commissioner credits the decrease in crime to several factors, including emerging out of the pandemic and a calming in civil unrest. More importantly, there has been increased policing of four districts in and around North Philadelphia which began in late 2022. That includes the 22nd, 24th, 25th, and 39th districts. \"I think being able to redeploy personnel,\" Stanford said on the increased policing. \"We pulled people out of administrative positions, put them out on the street, every class that came out of police academy in 2023 were sent out to those four core districts.\" Homicides are now down more than 20%, non-fatal shootings are down 28%, and violent crime is down roughly 7%. \"This may be the largest one-year drop in the history of this city as it relates to homicides,\" Stanford added. Despite the success, it comes on the heels of two years with over 500 homicides each. And while violent crime is down, some property crimes have exploded. Retail theft is up 28%, and reports of stolen vehicles were up 72%. District Attorney Larry Krasner blamed much of the increase in stolen vehicles on flaws in some cars that make them easier to steal. \"Thank you, Mr. Hyundai. Thank you, Mr. Kia. It would be nice if you made a car children couldn't steal, but that's what is happening there,\" said Krasner. Critics have blasted the district attorney for his handling of retail theft crimes, which his office often charged as a summary offense. He said he will focus on prosecuting retail theft rings in 2024. \"Do you think more needs to be done on your part?\" asked Action News Reporter Chad Pradelli. \"I think more needs to be done all the time,\" replied Krasner. \"And we've been working closely with the new challenges of retail theft. These are challenges that were not there before.\" Both Krasner and Stanford are hopeful of the decrease in crime, but say more work is ahead. \"The numbers are what they are, but they are just statistics,\" said Stanford. \"If people don't feel safe in this city, then those numbers mean nothing.\" Stanford also said a concern for him is while shootings are down, gun confiscations are up.
