Picture: REUTERS/SIPHIWE SIBEKO\nMaputo — Mozambique’s ruling party Frelimo has retained power in this month’s election, extending its five-decade rule as the opposition accused it of fraud.\nFrelimo’s Daniel Chapo will succeed President Filipe Nyusi to become Mozambique’s fifth president since its independence from Portugal in 1975. Nyusi is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms.\nChapo won over 70% of votes, the electoral commission said on Thursday. Venâncio Mondlane, backed by the Podemos party, came second with 20% of votes, displacing former rebel movement Renamo, which had been the official opposition party but whose candidate came third.\nIn parliament, Frelimo increased its number of seats to 195 out of 250, more than the 184 it had before.\nObservers have said the October 9 election was not free and fair. A EU mission reported irregularities during counting and alteration of results at the local and district level, problems which have marred most polls since Frelimo first allowed multiparty elections in 1994.\nDaniel Chapo in Matola, Mozambique, October 6 2024. Picture: REUTERS/SIPHIWE SIBEKO The electoral commission has declined to comment on allegations of vote-rigging. A Frelimo spokesperson did not reply to requests for comment.\nShortly after Chapo was declared winner, Mozambique’s sole dollar bond, maturing in 2031, fell for a fourth day, TradeWeb data showed as investors assessed the risk of unrest.\nMondlane, who has the support of many of the country’s young voters and claims he is the election winner, had already called for nationwide protests on Thursday and Friday. Groups of protesters started to gather in the capital Maputo after the result was announced.\nPolice on Monday used tear gas and gunfire to disperse opposition supporters protesting the murder of a Podemos lawyer and party official two days earlier, raising tensions.\nChapo, a lawyer, is seen as a business-friendly choice who analysts say is likely to maintain the status quo, including a fight against Islamist insurgents in the north and partnerships with companies such as ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies , which are trying to get major gas projects off the ground.\nThe country of nearly 35-million people is struggling with a large debt burden and worsening climate shocks, including drought and cyclones.\nReuters",

    "title": "Egypt’s ports ‘major supply outlets’ for Israel during war on Gaza",
    "text": "An open-source investigation has found that Egyptian seaports have become major stations for cargo and cement ships transporting goods to and from Israel since the war on the besieged Gaza Strip began last October. The investigation published on Thursday by Arabi Post monitored the activity of 19 ships over the past three months and tracked their sea routes, using open-source maritime data. It found that they were confined to traveling back and forth between Israeli and Egyptian ports. According to the report, dozens of other ships were also transporting goods to and from Israel but they were not limited to moving between the Israeli and Egyptian ports. During the same period, no ships from other Arab countries arrived at Israeli ports, the report said. “Egyptian ports are vital points for transporting goods to and from Israel due to their proximity to Israeli ports, especially Ashdod Port, which is about 29 kilometers away from Gaza, as well as the strategic Haifa Port,” Arabi Post said, noting that the closeness between the ports reduces shipping costs which affect the prices of shipped goods. The investigation is based on data from the activity of seven ports, including the Israeli ports of Ashdod and Haifa, and the Egyptian ports of Port Said, Abu Qir, Alexandria, Dekheila, and Damietta, which are located on the Mediterranean Sea. The 19 vessels included seven container ships, six cement carriers, five general cargo ships, and one bulk carrier which transports bulk cargo such as grains, sugar, and coal. The investigation showed that the seven container ships and the five general cargo ships primarily operated between Egypt's Alexandria, Damietta, Dekheila, Port Said, and al-Arish, and the Israeli ports of Haifa and Ashdod. These ships sailed under the flags of Panama, Liberia, Israel, Egypt, Antigua and Barbuda, Singapore, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. According to Vesselfinder ship tracking data, these 12 ships are owned by companies in Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Singapore, Germany and Cyprus. The investigation also found that the six cement carriers did not frequently visit Egyptian ports in 2022 and 2023, but their trips focused on Israel and Egypt during the war on Gaza, Arabi Post reported. The report noted that the ships primarily operated between the Egyptian ports of al-Arish, Abu Qir and Alexandria, and the Israeli ports of Haifa and Ashdod. Both al-Arish and Alexandria have cement factories. Egypt’s trade with Israel has increased since the war on Gaza began in October. Arabi Post cited data as saying that Egypt's exports to Israel between October 2023 and July 31, 2024 hit $170.1 million, while exports during the same period in 2022 and 2023 amounted to $162.8 million. Egypt’s imports from Israel after the war nearly tripled. Egypt’s imports from Israel between October 2023 and July 2024 were $331.6 million, while imports during the same months of 2022 and 2023 amounted to $106.8 million. The investigation comes while Gaza is under complete siege, with Egypt saying Israel was not cooperating with the delivery of aid into the strip.

Este incidente ocurrió poco después de que el músico sorprendiera a la artista con una propuesta de matrimonio en el escenario del Parque Metropolitano Simón Bolívar, durante el festival de verano celebrado a inicios de agosto.\nAhora puede seguirnos en Facebook y en nuestro WhatsApp Channel .\nLa cantante vallenata afirmó que fue abandonada en un concierto luego de una discusión - crédito @Dimelo.king/TikTok Inicialmente, se especuló que el desacuerdo podría haberse originado por un retraso del acordeonero para llegar al lugar debido a que algunos asistentes al evento en Bucaramanga afirmaron que Ana del Castillo no se presentó junto a ‘Chide’ García, sino que estuvo acompañada por otro acordeonero conocido como el Pollo Robles; sin embargo, el programa Lo sé todo reveló que la disputa estaría relacionada con una supuesta infidelidad por parte de García.\nEn ese momento, la intérprete de éxitos como Sabroso y Ya es mío ni ‘Chide’ García emitieron declaraciones oficiales sobre los rumores de su separación. Sin embargo, la atención mediática en torno a este tema siguió creciendo, y los fanáticos de ambos artistas en el género vallenato se cuestionaban cuál era la verdad tras su ruptura.\nLa cantante, conocida por su estilo único y su capacidad para conectar con el público, decidió no callar más y aclaró los rumores en una entrevista en el pódcast Tamo en vivo de Dímelo King y otros influenciadores.\nEn un pódcast, la artista habló sobre mantener la profesionalidad en medio de tensiones personales - crédito @chide.garcia/Instagram “Lo que pasa es que se le da importancia a lo importante. ¿Me entiendes? Lo que pasa es que cuando uno habla de temas de relaciones, uno termina siendo el malo: ‘Uy, expuso las cosas, dijo, no dijo’”, comenzó diciendo la artista.\nDel Castillo aclaró que no pensaba referirse al tema de su ruptura, pero quiso que se supiera la verdad: “Yo nunca he hablado de eso, pero voy a decir algo muy puntual. Uno en la vida siempre tiene que ser agradecido y lo laboral no se mezcla con lo personal (...) Por ejemplo, yo tengo una gira contigo y tú peleaste conmigo. Yo igual te voy a pagar. Tú tienes que tocar”.\n“¿Y él dejó metido un show?”, preguntó el creador de contenido Elkin Jesús De La Hoz, conocido como Dímelo King, y la artista respondió: “Sí, claro, me dejó tocando sola. Sí, me dejó un show tirado, eso no es una mentira. No puedes mezclar un problema personal con un problema laboral, pero no pasa nada (...) Cuando tú mismo dejas tu propia papa tirada, eso es algo que ya está mal”.\nLa propuesta de matrimonio del acordeonero ocurrió semanas antes de la ruptura - crédito @chide.garcia/Instagram Los comentarios en las redes sociales no se hicieron esperar. Algunos defendieron las declaraciones de la cantante y otros defendieron al acordeonero: “Ana del castillo se ve muy linda así”; “Me sorprende la madurez de Ana, está bastante centrada y un nivel emocional bastante desarrollado, al punto que no habla ni de lo bueno o malo. Solo es diplomática”; “siempre he visto de ella que nunca habla de lo que fue, sea bueno o malo, va pa’lante”; “Tiene toda la razón 💯👏”; “Si no hay un contrato que lo obligue tu tampoco podías obligarlo”.\nDespués de su ruptura con ‘Chide’ García, la cantante vallenata Ana del Castillo oficializó su unión musical con el reconocido acordeonero Sergio Luis Rodríguez, que trabajó con figuras destacadas del género como Peter Manjarrés, Jorge Celedón y Elder Dayán.\nLa carrera de la artista ha estado marcada por su talento y por su capacidad para conectar con el público, pero también por episodios que han generado atención mediática. Este nuevo capítulo, con la incorporación de Sergio Luis Rodríguez, podría abrir nuevas posibilidades para la artista, tanto en términos musicales como en su relación con sus seguidores. Este cambio podría ser una oportunidad para que la cantante consolide su carrera y explore nuevas facetas artísticas.",
