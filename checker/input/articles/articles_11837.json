    "text": "Saturday looks likely to bring classic conditions for flooding in Sausalito and other North Bay estuaries. There’s a rainy storm that will arrive with strong winds and a king tide that will peak at the Golden Gate at 0945. These are the conditions that put Gate 5 Road and many other areas of Richardson Bay underwater. Though now there are far fewer resident boats on Richardson Bay, those that remain will face the winter storm conditions that have damaged so many others.\nThis photo was taken on a calm king-tide day in Sausalito. Adding strong southerly winds can make these situations much worse. © 2024 Robert Sanford https://www.flickr.com/groups/cakingtides/pool/with/27715607109/ The California Coastal Commission is again asking anyone who’s out braving the elements to submit photos of king tides that will be occurring today through Sunday. You can submit king-tide photos to the Coastal Commission here . Woody Skoriak caught some great photos in Sausalito during a November king-tide weekend with much nicer weather. The rain and southerly wind could make it more dramatic this weekend.\nUnfortunately, the Saturday weather also looks like as if it will be challenging for midwinters and Saturday night lighted yacht parades. We hope everyone makes the best of it and has dock lines, fenders and chafing gear ready for the winter weather.",

Traffic flow will then be adjusted accordingly. While the grant has been awarded some questions remain regarding federal funding right now. The MPO is waiting until there are clear instructions to move forward. And there could be a bit of a delay in implementing the technology. Watch a quick explanation of how it works:\nHow new traffic control devices will work in Waco BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:\nWaco's MPO received 1.44 million dollars for the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation, or SMART grant.\nWith the federal money– it will test existing AI technology to sense traffic conditions at intersections in real-time. Traffic flow will then be adjusted accordingly.\n\"Right now, it all works on timing, but it does not take into account how the traffic changes during the daytime,\" MPO Director Mukesh Kumar said. \"So morning and the evening rush hour, traffic that does not signal, don't have to behave the same way throughout the day. This is another example where, with these AI based sensors, we can adjust it so that a maximum amount of traffic can flow through.\"\nWaco's MPO Director Mukesh Kumar tells 25 News with this, each intersection will become its own decision-making unit.\n\"So with this technology, what we can do is that we can look about 100 yards on all four sides of the intersection and measure the exact amount of volume of traffic that we are expecting at any location,\" he said. \"Then also notice what is happening here at the intersection and make the timing of the signal itself adjust according to the traffic condition.\"\nOne example of how this could be used is when there are events in our neighborhood.\n\"In the downtown area, let's say there is an event, or there are lots of festivities happening, and we want to prioritize pedestrian movement over everything else. So you want all the traffic lights throughout the downtown at that moment, for that specific period, to prioritize pedestrian movement.\"\nKumar tells 25 News —that the grant is only the first step to demonstrate and test the technology around town.\nIn the future, he says they would like to extend it throughout McLennan County.\nFollow Bella on social media!",

    "text": "Revolutionizing Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treatments Ahead\nCaleb PriceUpdated: 04-23-2025 05:39 PM\nTransformative Growth in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Care\nThe metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) market is witnessing remarkable growth, primarily because of innovative advancements in therapies that focus on targeted treatments, immunotherapies, and personalized medicine. The rising incidence of colorectal cancer, combined with an increasing emphasis on early detection and treatment, has been a driving force behind the demand for pioneering treatment options.\nUnderstanding Metastatic Colorectal Cancer\nColorectal cancer is highly prevalent, standing as the third most common form of cancer worldwide. When it progresses to the metastatic stage, it often leads to significantly higher mortality rates. The liver and peritoneum are the primary sites where this cancer spreads. Unfortunately, for many patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC, the disease remains incurable, complicating treatment beyond typical approaches. Common metastatic sites include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum, posing considerable challenges for effective intervention.\nImpact of KRAS Mutations\nKras mutations occur in about 45% of colorectal cancer patients and have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. These mutations often result in a more aggressive disease progression and present resistance to both chemotherapy and targeted therapies, which ultimately lead to lower survival rates.\nTrends in Treatment Approaches\nIn 2024, the number of metastatic colorectal cancer cases across major patient markets was estimated at around 294,000. This figure is anticipated to grow significantly by 2034. Traditional therapies such as surgical interventions play a crucial role in treating resectable cases, whereas mistreatment commonly involves chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. However, many of these established treatments often lack specificity, which can result in detrimental effects on healthy cells.\nWhen it comes to mCRC, patients typically navigate through multiple lines of therapy. First-line treatments (1L) consist of chemotherapy combinations such as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and CAPEOX, combined with anti-angiogenic agents and advanced targeted therapies like VECTIBIX and ERBITUX. New therapies, including KEYTRUDA and BRAFTOVI, have gained approval for first-line use when paired with ERBITUX and mFOLFOX6. Treatment options broaden significantly in the second-line setting (2L), offering agents like OPDIVO, JEMPERLI, and TUKYSA, among others. For third-line (3L) approaches, medications such as STIVARGA and FRUZAQLA become part of the strategy.\nNew Therapeutic Innovations\nOne promising medication, FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib), is an oral capsule developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, specifically for patients previously treated with various chemotherapy regimens. As a kinase inhibitor, it selectively targets and inhibits key receptors involved in tumor growth.\nThe introduction of OPDIVO QVANTIG—a groundbreaking subcutaneous injection therapy—offers a potent treatment for adults with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, vastly improving administration timelines from approximately 30 minutes to just a few minutes.\nEmerging Competitive Landscape\nThe landscape of the metastatic colorectal cancer market remains intensely competitive, with ongoing research into investigational therapies like amivantamab, zanzalintinib, and vactosertib, which promise more effective treatment options. These breakthroughs reflect a commitment to identifying innovative therapies that can modify resistant cancer conditions, ensuring a more favorable treatment future.\nCompanies including Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Shanghai Henlius Biotech, and Cardiff Oncology are actively participating in this dynamic market landscape, developing therapies aimed at addressing unmet patient needs.\nGrowth Projections for the Future\nDelveInsight projects the metastatic colorectal cancer market in major patient enteric areas will grow from an estimated USD 13 billion in 2024, with significant potential for compounded growth leading up to 2034. Advancements in precision medicine, particularly through targeted therapies and immunotherapies, are pivotal in enhancing patient outcomes and shaping the future of treatment pathways.\nThe latest comprehensive market report sheds light on which therapeutic options are predicted to capture the most substantial market share. This report provides thorough insights into country-specific treatment guidelines, patient pool dynamics, and epidemiological forecasts, uncovering vital opportunities and evaluating market potential.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the main cause of metastatic colorectal cancer?\nMetastatic colorectal cancer primarily occurs when cancer cells from the colon or rectum spread to other parts of the body, commonly the liver and lungs, making treatment more complex.\nHow does KRAS mutation affect treatment options?\nKRAS mutations are known to contribute to treatment resistance, making it more challenging to achieve effective outcomes with standard chemotherapy and targeted therapies.\nWhat are the newest therapies for mCRC?\nLatest therapies include FRUZAQLA and OPDIVO QVANTIG, which provide novel approaches to address treatment-resistance issues in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.\nWhat is the expected market growth for mCRC treatments?\nThe mCRC treatment market is projected to grow significantly, potentially reaching USD 13 billion by 2024, with a robust CAGR anticipated over the following decade.\nWhat role do emerging companies play in mCRC treatment development?\nEmerging companies are crucial in developing new therapies and innovative solutions, working to meet the unmet needs in metastatic colorectal cancer care and drive advancements in treatment.\nAbout The Author\nContact Caleb Price privately here.

    "text": "Carlos Guevara• Colombia.com\nRichard Ríos sigue en modo ‘animal’: marcó un golazo en el primer clásico paulista del año\nEl antioqueño sigue aumentando su valor de cara al final de la temporada.\nEl antioqueño sigue aumentando su valor de cara al final de la temporada.\nEl mediocampista oriundo de Vegachí sigue consolidándose como una pieza clave en el equipo 'Verdao', reafirmando su gran momento en el fútbol brasileño tras su más reciente actuación, el pasado 22 de enero, en la victoria 2-1 de su equipo ante Santos, en el marco de la tercera ronda del Torneo Paulista.\nEn un duelo que comenzó cuesta arriba para Palmeiras, ya que Santos tomó la ventaja en el marcador durante el primer tiempo, Ríos jugó un papel determinante al sellar la remontada del equipo en un dificil encuentro en el que Guilherme fue el encargado de romper el empate inicial con un potente disparo desde fuera del área, dejando sin respuesta al portero rival.\nComo lo indicó el portal Win Sports, la segunda mitad trajo consigo una mejora en el juego colectivo de Palmeiras, lo que se reflejó en el empate, tras una gran jugada colectiva que culminó en el 1-1, devolviendo las esperanzas al equipo visitante.\nY ya en el tiempo añadido, Richard Ríos apareció con una genialidad que cambió el destino del partido. La jugada decisiva se originó en el minuto 90+1, tras un tiro de esquina que generó un rebote dentro del área. La defensa de Santos intentó despejar el peligro, pero el balón quedó en el aire, y Ríos, mostrando su técnica y determinación, conectó un potente disparo que dejó sin opciones al arquero rival.\n?????? GOL de Richard Rios para darle la victoria a Palmeiras ???? ante Santos en el minuto 90+2’ del primer clásico paulista de la temporada.— Julián Capera (@JulianCaperaB)\n[pic.twitter.com/OXJslnr6nX] [January 23, 2025]\nEl gol de Ríos no solo le dio la victoria a Palmeiras, sino que también aseguró el liderato del grupo D del Torneo Paulista, con siete puntos en las primeras tres fechas. Este resultado refuerza la condición del equipo como uno de los favoritos en el inicio del campeonato.\n¿Cuándo será el próximo partido de Palmeiras?\nEl próximo desafío para Richard Ríos y Palmeiras será el sábado 25 de enero, cuando enfrenten a Novorizontino en la cuarta jornada del torneo. Con actuaciones como la de este encuentro, el colombiano sigue demostrando su calidad y ganándose el reconocimiento de la afición del Palmeiras y aumentando su número de pretendientes en Europa.\nTranquilo, nem tanto, mas favorável... BAILA, REELS! ????— SE Palmeiras (@Palmeiras)\n[pic.twitter.com/svdgSgN8Mg] [January 23, 2025]",
