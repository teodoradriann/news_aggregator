    "text": "Before reaching for the bleach to return your pillow cases to their original glory, we’ve got some tips for you to try. After all, bleach can be pretty harsh on your linen, or worse, it can make them more yellow (depending on the bleach). How to make your yellowed pillow cases white again Alice, a BHG reader, got in touch after trying everything to get the yellow out of her pillow cases, wanting to share how she did it. “I soaked them overnight in dishwashing liquid and bi-carb soda. Then I put them in the washing machine with two cups of vinegar and dried them in the sun,” Alice says. She added: “It was a bit of a process, but it worked.” How to get yellow stains out of white pillow cases What you’ll need: - 1/4 cup dishwashing detergent (preferably clear) - 1/2 cup [bi-carb soda](https://go.skimresources.com?id=105419X1625869&xs=1&xcust=bhg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woolworths.com.au%2Fshop%2Fproductdetails%2F428726%2Fmckenzie-s-bi-carb-soda) Method: - Fill a tub or bath with hot water. Add your bi-carb soda and dishwashing detergent. Once dissolved, add your pillow cases. - Give them a good stir and a poke. - Leave to soak overnight. - Drain the tub or bath the following day and transfer the sheets to a washing machine. - Wash on a regular cycle with 2 cups of vinegar and your normal detergent. - Dry in the sun. Why bed linen can turn yellow and how to prevent it It helps to understand why your pillow cases keep turning yellow and how to prevent it. In a nutshell, your pillow cases are turning yellow because of the sweat and body oils that build up in the material over time if not washed regularly and adequately. Here are some tips to help keep your sheets white: - Wash them regularly. - Try adding a small amount of [washing soda](https://go.skimresources.com?id=105419X1625869&xs=1&xcust=bhg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woolworths.com.au%2Fshop%2Fproductdetails%2F263093)to your washing cycle. Here's [how to use washing soda.](https://www.bhg.com.au/how-to-use-washing-soda) - Make sure you aren’t using too much detergent - here’s [how much detergent you should use](https://www.bhg.com.au/why-clothes-feel-crunchy)(it’s less than what it says on the packaging.) - Make sure you are using a filler-free washing detergent. Here’s how to tell if your [detergent contains fillers](https://www.bhg.com.au/laundry-detergent-fillers). How often should you wash your bed sheets? Washing your bedsheets regularly will reduce discolouration, and it's recommended you wash your bedsheets at least once every two weeks. Doing so will ensure that there's less chance for a deep stain, and it also prevents excessive build up of dust mites, bacteria, and even your own dead skin! If you live in a warmer climate, or if you have pets sleeping in ned with you, we'd recommend washing your sheets much more regularly to once a week.

    "title": "DOG DAYS: Unhoused people with pets struggle with heat, shelter | News | tahlequahdailypress.com",
    "text": "TAHLEQUAH – Unhoused individuals with pets deal with summer heat and finding safe places to stash their animals, but some assistance is available, and many businesses set out water bowls and allow dogs to come inside to cool off. For those who can't be without their dogs even though they're dealing with being unhoused, finding places that allow them to bring their pets inside to cool off and get water is a blessing. Connie McDonald pulls her dog, Casey, in a special wagon to keep her pet safe from traffic and paws off of the hot pavement. At the Day Center – one of the places where pets cannot come inside – Casey waited patiently Wednesday in her wagon while McDonald ate lunch. \"I pay for my dog's food, and I've had her since she was 6 weeks old,\" McDonald said. \"She can go in some places in her cart. Of course, we can't go in eating places.\" McDonald is sleeping wherever she can find a spot, and even though she has a dog, that doesn't make her feel safer. \"Sometimes it's hard with the heat, and now I was told they don't allow dogs in the cooling station at the American Legion, unless they are therapy dogs,\" McDonald said. She sometimes feels sorry for her dog because she doesn't have a place for her. \"Now me, [not having a place] doesn't matter, but she's my baby,\" McDonald said. Commander Daniel Gross at American Legion Post 50 said they were allowing dogs access and had water and snacks for the animals. Then a woman came in with a pit bull that didn't get along with the other dogs. \"We aren't a shelter, so we can't house their dogs all day long,\" Gross said. \"I didn't want to [ban them], but if it's a service animal, they can come inside. People with dogs still come to the door and we give them a chair to sit in under the shade with the animals.\" Gross said he is an animal person, but with children in the building and the possibility of a dog being aggressive, they can't be allowed in. People struggling with feeding or getting medical assistance for their pets can call the animal shelter run by the city of Tahlequah, said City Code Enforcement Officer Vicky Green. \"We can help them with spay and neuter with the Cherokee County Humane Society, and provide vaccines, get flea and tick [treatment] and dewormer,\" Green said. \"We can provide food from Chewy and Humane Society of the United States – we get donations from them – and anything that can help them keep their pet healthy.\" When a person is incarcerated and owns a dog, the animal is impounded and taken care of medically. The city requires the animal be kept up to five days, McDonald said. \"If we don't get a response from a responsible person or from the arrested person, we will adopt them out or euthanize, depending on what's going on,\" Green said. \"Ninety-nine percent of them go back with their owners.\" Green said several businesses and churches allow people with pets to come in and cool down, and they leave water out for the animal. \"Honestly, most of the pets of the homeless are pretty healthy,\" Green said. \"If we see a person walking around with their dogs in a stroller or cart, we pull over and give them food, vaccines and supplies. We've given puppy pens and soft crates to help mobilize the animal so they aren't carrying them in their arms or dragging them on a leash.\" She said they just helped one homeless person take care of 10 small dogs with food and medical care. \"The homeless really take care of their dogs,\" Green said. \"They aren't going to let anyone hurt their dog and most don't even ask for help. But we do stop and provide help, and it's case-by-case, call-by-call.\" Green said the city is lucky to have partners with the Humane Society and [Chewy.com](http://Chewy.com) that give donations. \"The city doesn't want them to spread diseases like ringworm, mange, fleas and parasites, and we treat them for anything that keeps the animal healthy, so they aren't transmitting disease through the parks or walkways,\" Green said. Cherokee County Humane Society President Shaun West said the organization doesn't have a program to help the homeless with their pets due to lack of space, other than the spay and neuter clinics. \"We have 16 pens at the shelter so we don't have a lot of opportunities to help except for emergencies, and we can't do those unless someone adopts one of animals we have now,\" West said. ,With the hot weather, adoptions are more difficult as people aren't coming out to the shelter, West said. \"I see a lot of homeless people walking around with pets and I wonder myself how they take care of them,\" West said. He said the spay-and-neuter clinics are offered once a month and sometimes twice. \"I know anybody who is homeless would qualify for the spay-and-neuter clinics, and the highest copay is $20 and some don't have to do any copay,\" West said. If an animal bites somebody, there are only two choices, West said. \"They have to be quarantined for 10 days or they have to be euthanized,\" West said. \"The choices are bad, but 10 days' quarantined is better than euthanasia.\" Billy Harrison has a pit/hound mix, Wrong Way, and said mobility with a pet is the hardest part of owning an animal and being homeless. Harrison has been homeless for about four years and admits he has been in prison, with a teardrop tattoo on his face the evidence of his time served. He said he is his own worst enemy and can't blame anyone but himself. \"It's kind of hard to get around with Wrong Way in the summer 'cause the streets are so hot,\" McDonald said. \"Sometimes the grass is hotter.\"",

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS , Dec. 28, Retail media is an undeniably hot topic within the ever-changing realm of media and marketing. But for brands, the entry point into retail media is intimidating at best, and ongoing optimization of the emerging space is a moving target.\nOvative Group's \"The Lead, Conversations That Matter,\" gives you behind-the-scenes insight into the real conversations agencies and marketing experts are having about navigating the world of retail media.\nThe series kicked off with a relatable topic for many brands, entitled \" Why It's Difficult to Start a Retail Media Network .\" Our experts get real: the biggest roadblock they witness is often internal team dynamics—activating on a cohesive strategy, navigating competing priorities, and aligning on roadmaps across teams.\nIn subsequent episodes, experts address the lack of metric standardization and how the industry is shifting in this space. Plus, they address why advertisers don't trust retail media reporting. Retail media sits so low in the purchase funnel that some advertisers wonder about the right attribution methodology to demonstrate success. However, conversations are not limited to reporting. Ovative experts also dive into hot topics like clean rooms and data privacy, AI's impact on customer experience and audience targeting, and the digitization of in-store experiences.\nOvative's \"The Lead, Conversations That Matter\" is an extension of the real, everyday conversations that occur among the firm's retail media experts. The campaign has also covered Holistic Search—the strategic integration of SEO and SEM—and in the new year, will dive into topics like unified marketing measurement, leveraging MarTech to move the needle for businesses, and the future of integrated video.\nEach conversation shares one thing in common: passionate marketers breaking down some of the most critical topics across the marketing landscape.

    "text": "本报记者  顾 春\n高从堦(后排左)在指导学生做实验。 受访者供图\n人物小传\n高从堦，1942年生，山东青岛人，中国工程院院士、浙江工业大学膜分离与水处理协同创新中心主任。长期从事海水综合利用及膜分离领域的研究与开发工作，是我国膜分离技术领域的著名专家和反渗透膜工程技术领域的开拓者之一。曾两次获得国家科技进步奖一等奖，获得何梁何利科技进步奖、浙江省科技重大贡献奖、10多项省部级科技进步奖。\n翻开中国海水淡化技术的发展史，高从堦的名字位列其中。在国内最先筹建“中空纤维反渗透膜”的研制项目整套设施，促使国外相关产品降价30%；建成国内首条反渗透复合膜生产线，实现反渗透膜国产化，打破国外垄断；成功研制海水淡化工程应用的反渗透组件，解决海岛居民饮用水难题……如今，耄耋之年的高从堦仍活跃在膜技术研发的第一线。\n迎难而上，“从0到1”攻克海水淡化难题\n高从堦与膜技术故事的开端，要追溯到上世纪60年代。那个时候，为解决沿海地区水资源短缺问题，我国开始在海水淡化领域进行探索。\n早期，海水淡化主要采用蒸馏法，但成本很高，不具备推广价值。1967年，国家海洋局受原国家科委委托，组织全国范围内的科研力量，在北京、青岛和上海三地开启海水淡化研究。刚毕业两年、就职于国家海洋局第一海洋研究所的高从堦，被抽调到青岛，参与反渗透膜的研究与开发。\n“为找到项目所需的高压泵，我们跑了全国很多工厂，最后是在上海的一家小型泵厂找到能用得上的型号。”高从堦回忆，当时物资匮乏，试验样机也是东拼西凑而来。比如，试验所用的聚氯乙烯烧结多孔板、用环氧树脂和玻璃纤维压制出的承压板等器材，都是实验室人员自己动手制作的。\n可喜的是，仅耗时一年多，科研团队便成功研制出醋酸纤维不对称反渗透膜，脱盐率可达96%以上，实现我国海水淡化反渗透膜从无到有的跨越。\n后来，我国第一个海水淡化研究室在浙江杭州组建。高从堦从青岛来到杭州，继续从事海水淡化相关研究。\n1974年，高从堦被推荐为“中空纤维反渗透膜和组器研究”课题的负责人。“当时我带领只有3个人的课题组，因陋就简地建起中空纤维抽丝实验室。”高从堦说，他们决定开展三醋酸纤维素(CTA)中空纤维形成的热致相分离研究，这在我国尚属首次。\n这一干就是9年。“我们克服资料少、原材料和设备短缺等困难，逐步筹建了从小试、中试到批量制备的整套设施。”高从堦回忆，通过一次次试验和测试，就在1983年，CTA中空纤维反渗透膜及组器研制相关成果通过了国家海洋局和浙江省科委联合组织的鉴定。该项成果具有操作压力低、透水量大等优点，可广泛地应用于纯水制备和苦咸水淡化，售价仅为国外相似产品的1/3左右，此后迫使国外企业将同类产品价格降低30%到50%。\n1990年，高从堦团队成功解决了大型中盐度苦咸水脱盐组件的制膜技术和粘结密封等重要关键技术。1997年，在浙江舟山嵊山岛建成我国第一个自主设计制造的500吨/日反渗透海水淡化项目。2000年，我国第一座1000吨/日海水淡化设备研制成功并投入使用……“向海洋要淡水”从理论变成现实。\n不断攀登，见证中国膜分离产业从无到有、从有到优的发展历程\n高从堦大学时主修的外语是俄语，仅在最后一个学年听过英语课，这样的英语基础不足以阅读英文文献。为了更好地参与科研，高从堦暗下决心要提高英语水平。\n1972年，他花了近一个月的工资，买了一台收音机用来学习英语。经过一段时间努力，他可以准确高效地阅读英文文献。然而，他并不满足，又学习了日语。经他翻译的多篇日本反渗透膜研究领域的第一手资料，为我国的膜技术研究提供了有价值的前沿信息。\n1982年2月，高从堦参与了一次为期2年的出国学习。在此期间，他与导师一起，在国际上首次采用离子交联复合法、功能团等当量反应法和孔径热保护法制备多种复合膜，最终发表两篇有关荷电膜研究的科研论文。\n高从堦回国后，他带领团队研制出国内第一张芳香族聚酰胺反渗透复合膜，填补国内空白；在国内最先建成芳香族聚酰胺反渗透复合膜生产线，初步实现反渗透复合膜的产业化；在国内首次实现活性染料脱盐纯化提级的工业应用……\n当被问及如何做科研，高从堦告诉年轻人：“做科研不能只知埋头苦干，更要学会抬头看世界前沿。”\n他讲起自己早年的经历，“1974年，我开始带团队独立做科研项目，那时候没经验，找到一个方向就闷头往前冲，但研究了近一年，便决定放弃。”原因是与国内其他研究团队“撞题”。\n“相同的科研项目，别的团队有三四十名科研人员参与，我们只是几个人的小团队，强行推动项目，是对科研资源的浪费。”高从堦转换赛道，转而开展CTA相关研究。这次的及时转型，推动我国在上世纪80年代拥有了自主研发、自主设计、自主生产的中空纤维反渗透膜。\n50余年的科研生涯，高从堦见证了中国膜分离产业从无到有、从有到优的发展历程。据统计，2023年，中国膜企业总数达2000多家，膜工业总产值约4384亿元，占全球膜工业总产值的30%左右。在大规模应用方面，我国的膜分离技术基本达到世界先进水平，是全球最大的分离膜生产国之一。\n坚守一线，不断推动膜技术应用场景拓展\n在浙江工业大学莫干山校区，高从堦团队成员、浙江工业大学化学工程学院实验师徐燕青正在开展耐溶剂纳滤膜的工业化放大实验。年逾八十的高从堦观看片刻后，指着已经颇具规模的长卷膜材料给出建议：“膜材料的工业化放大应用，除了膜材料本身的耐溶剂特性，还要考虑其他组件和粘胶的耐溶剂特性，这是一项系统性工程。”\n在高从堦等专家的指导下，浙江工业大学凭借“新型膜法水处理关键技术及应用”项目获得2023年度国家科技进步奖一等奖。该新型膜法处理技术，取得了海水淡化、超纯水制备、医药纯化、核沾染水处理等多项关键技术突破。\n令高从堦的学生周勇敬佩的是，高从堦现在仍坚持每天阅读膜技术领域最新外文文献，遇到有启发意义的，他会写上自己的思考后分享给大家，为科研工作打开新视野。\n虽然科研工作非常忙碌，每逢接到高校讲座或学术研讨的邀请，高从堦都欣然前往，“如果我们这一辈人的经验能给予青年一些启发，那再好不过了。”\n“洁净厂房用的空气净化器、医院用的血液透析仪、太阳能面板等产品都有膜技术应用。”高从堦介绍，社会的进步和产业的发展都需要膜技术，除了广泛用于海水和苦咸水淡化、饮用水净化的液体分离膜外，还有气体分离膜、特种分离膜、新能源膜和医用膜等种类，现已基本实现国产化，并应用于各行各业。\n随着膜技术在其他领域的应用不断拓展，未来科研人员大有可为。高从堦期待更多的科研人员勇于尝试、不断探索，共同推动中国膜技术继续取得新突破。\n《 人民日报 》( 2025年04月03日 06 版)",

    "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. ( WHNS /Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed. According to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed. “As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in a Facebook post . “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.” The employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works. A man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat. He described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet. Brother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued. The shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer. Lilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other. “She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.

    "title": "Investigadores del CNIC realizan un descubrimiento \"trascendental\" en la comprensión de las arritmias cardíacas",
    "text": "MADRID, 11 Abr. (EUROPA PRESS) - Un equipo del Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) ha hecho un descubrimiento \"trascendental\" en la comprensión de las arritmias cardíacas, al desvelar los misterios del síndrome de Andersen-Tawil (ATS), un trastorno cardíaco hereditario extremadamente raro. Liderado por el jefe de Grupo de Arritmias Cardíacas del CNIC, José Jalife, el estudio demuestra que la mutación genética especifica (C122Y) en un canal de potasio (Kir2.1) no solo altera la función de ese canal, sino también la del canal principal de sodio (NaV1.5) del corazón, estableciendo un vínculo directo con las arritmias potencialmente letales asociadas al síndrome de Andersen-Tawil (ATS). El estudio, publicado en la revista 'Circulation Research', revela por primera vez que la mutación C122Y en el canal Kir2.1 tiene un efecto doble sobre los canales Kir2.1 y NaV1.5: conduce a una reorganización del canal Kir2.1 que desestabiliza su unión con el fosfolípido PIP2, regulador principal en la membrana celular, y también desestabiliza la expresión de la proteína que forma el canal NaV1.5, reduciendo su función. Para los investigadores, la interacción de estos dos canales es vital para garantizar un ritmo cardíaco estable. Se calcula que una de cada 3 personas padecerá una arritmia cardiaca a lo largo de su vida, aunque el síndrome de Andersen-Tawil afecta a menos de 1 por cada millón de personas. Está caracterizado por una tríada de síntomas que incluyen parálisis periódica, arritmias cardíacas y rasgos faciales distintivos. Las mutaciones en el gen KCNJ2, responsable del canal Kir2.1, heredadas de manera autosómica dominante, son las causantes del ATS tipo 1. Los investigadores han ido más allá, creando un modelo de ratón que replica las principales irregularidades eléctricas cardíacas en pacientes con ATS1. Este modelo reveló que la mutación no solo afecta a Kir2.1, sino que también interfiere con la estabilidad y expresión del canal NaV1.5 en el corazón, reduciendo su función. En este sentido, Jalife subraya la relevancia de esta interacción para la salud cardíaca, advirtiendo que cualquier alteración que perturbe la función de uno o de ambos canales puede desatar arritmias potencialmente mortales. \"El descubrimiento de que una mutación considerada 'monogénica' no solo perturba al canal iónico afectado directamente por la mutación, sino también la función de un canal complementario, ambos fundamentales para la excitabilidad y la conducción eléctrica del corazón, supone una mayor comprensión de los mecanismos asociados a las arritmias cardíacas asociadas no solo con ATS1, sino también con patologías cardiacas más habituales\", ha señalado señala el responsable principal del estudio, Francisco Cruz. Además, Cruz ha añadido que los resultados \"respaldan la hipótesis de que los mecanismos moleculares varían según la mutación específica, abriendo la puerta a tratamientos farmacológicos y manejo clínico personalizados para cada paciente\". Este avance, concluyen los investigadores, representa un hito en la comprensión y abordaje de las arritmias cardíacas, ofreciendo un paradigma revolucionario con potencial impacto clínico. Mejorar el conocimiento sobre la función del canal Kir2.1 allana el camino para enfoques innovadores y seguros que podrían prevenir la muerte súbita en diversas enfermedades cardíacas, beneficiando a millones de personas en todo el mundo. Asimismo, para los científicos, sentará las bases para la generación de enfoques innovadores, efectivos y seguros para prevenir la muerte súbita en estas y otras enfermedades cardíacas devastadoras. En comparación con datos anteriores, todos los resultados presentados aquí respaldan la hipótesis de que los mecanismos moleculares que aumentan la susceptibilidad a las arritmias y la muerte súbita cardíaca en ATS1 son diferentes dependiendo de la mutación específica, por lo que el tratamiento farmacológico y el manejo clínico deberían ser diferentes para cada paciente.",
