    "text": "CALGARY — Calgary residents are getting a happy diversion from their water woes, as its annual Stampede summer festival begins today with a downtown parade. The parade comes a month to the day after a major water main broke in the city’s northwest, flooding streets and turning off the taps to 60 per cent of the drinking water for the city and surrounding communities. Crews scrambled to repair the line and, in the process, found five more weak spots to fix. A directive to have Calgarians cut their indoor water use by 25 per cent with fewer showers and toilet flushes was lifted earlier this week. A ban on outdoor watering remains in place as the water system runs at reduced capacity to keep enough water in reserve to fight fires and the replacement line undergoes tests. The Stampede – a combination midway fair, entertainment festival and rodeo competition — brings thousands of visitors to the city every July. Earlier this month, there were concerns the population bump from the 10-day event would push the city’s water system to a breaking point. Mayor Jyoti Gondek said while she has asked Calgarians to continue to go slow on their indoor water use, contingency plans are in place for the Stampede. “It was heartening to see that the Calgary Stampede and their CEO found a way to continue the greatest outdoor show on Earth in a responsible way, by finding ways to save water or bring in water from places outside of Calgary,” Gondek said Thursday. She said the Stampede will, for example, clean the rodeo grandstand less frequently using non-treated water. “When you head down to the Stampede grounds this year you will be able see the water storage tanks that are in place and ready to go as needed,\" she added. The parade, snaking through the downtown, is to be headed by actor and parade marshal Owen Crow Shoe. The Stampede is also the site of political pancake flipping. Premier Danielle Smith is scheduled to toss flapjacks on Monday, while the Opposition NDP, with new leader Naheed Nenshi, is to host three pancake events starting Sunday. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 5, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Columnist Russ Vernon-Jones: A win for the climate",
    "text": "Columnist Russ Vernon-Jones: A win for the climate\n|Published: 02-15-2024 7:31 PM|\nFor the last two months I’ve written to you about the U.S. becoming the world’s largest exporter of climate-destroying gas and oil; about the fossil fuel industry’s plans to vastly expand these harmful exports; and about a campaign to stop them by getting the Biden Administration to stop issuing permits for new export terminals. Today I’m writing to share the good news that the campaign was successful! Biden put a halt to all new LNG (Liquefied methane “Natural” Gas) export terminal permits on Jan. 26.\nThis is a big deal. It’s a win for the climate and for people everywhere who are impacted by climate change. It’s a win for the frontline communities along the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast who are fighting the increased air pollution, destruction of the local fishing industry, damaging health effects, and environmental destruction that more terminals would bring. It’s a win for everyone who thinks that the welfare of people and the planet is more important than further increasing the obscene profits of the gas and oil companies.\nThis is also a big deal because of how the decision came about — everything from TikTok to Jane Fonda played a role. Biden’s decision was a direct result of a grassroots campaign that put pressure on him not to approve any additional terminal permits. It was a remarkable demonstration of what people power can do.\nLed by frontline activists from the Gulf Coast, this campaign eventually included over 400,000 people signing a petition, a\nTikTok storm that probably reached over a million views, thousands of handwritten letters from senior citizens, a letter from 60 members of Congress, one from 170 scientists, and one from over 250 environmental and community groups, leaders of major climate organizations, celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and Jane Fonda, and over 600 people pledging to engage in civil disobedience at the Department of Energy in D.C. if Biden didn’t stop the permitting.\nThis is also a big deal because it is one of the first times that the government has taken action to limit the fossil fuel industry. The Inflation Reduction Act has provided powerful incentives for adopting renewable energy, but it did nothing to limit fossil fuels. We need to do both. Finally, we have begun.\nWhat Biden actually did was “pause” the issuing of permits. This was a strategic choice. A denial of permits could have been challenged in court and quickly overthrown. The pause does not have this vulnerability. The pause also will be used to revise the government’s process for considering future permits to include climate effects in determining whether a project is in the public interest.\nTo no one’s surprise, the fossil fuel industry is fighting back. They have launched a multi-million dollar public relations campaign and gotten allies in Congress to hold hostile hearings. Of course, the presidential election will be key. Trump has announced that if he is elected he will immediately increase drilling and export terminal construction and remove incentives for renewable energy.\nThere also are more struggles for climate advocates to have with the Biden Administration which is still using U.S. taxpayer money to\n[back]() fossil fuel infrastructure development in other countries, in violation of an international agreement we signed in 2021.\nNonetheless,\nBiden’s statement announcing the halt to permitting was remarkable. Even though he is president of a major gas and oil producing nation, he began his statement with, “In every corner of the country and the world, people are suffering the devastating toll of climate change.”\nHe went right at the MAGA Republicans, accusing them of “condemning the American people to a dangerous future” with their denial of the urgency of the climate crisis. He called the fossil fuel industry a “special interest” to which he will not bow.\nHe went on to call climate change “the existential threat of our time.” He acknowledged the importance of youth and frontline voices: “We will heed the calls of young people and frontline communities who are using their voices to demand action from those with the power to act.”\nAny win against the fossil fuel industry is a big win. Everyone who cares at all about the climate gets to celebrate this win and feel good about it. We also know that we still have a long struggle ahead of us — a struggle to end the harmful effects that the unscrupulous pursuit of profits by the oil and gas companies is having on our politics, our health, and the climate we share with all living creatures.\nRuss Vernon-Jones of Amherst is a member of the Steering Committee of Climate Action Now (CAN).

    "text": "A Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard and an endangered species, will be housed at a central Japan zoo, the city of Nagoya said Monday, making it the only one of its kind to be exhibited in the country. The reptile, a 13-year-old male named \"Taro,\" will arrive in Japan on July 18 and be exhibited at Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens from around late August, the city said. \"We have finally managed to bring (a Komodo dragon) here after intense negotiations. Please look forward to it,\" Nagoya Mayor Takashi Kawamura said at a press conference. During his election campaigns, Kawamura had promised to introduce attention-grabbing animals, such as a Komodo dragon, to the zoo. Singapore Zoo, which has been housing the giant lizard, decided to transfer it due to lack of space after receiving a female Komodo dragon for breeding purposes. Taro, owned by Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, will be offered on loan to the Higashiyama Zoo. Komodo dragons, a species native to Indonesia and designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, can grow to over 3 meters in length and weigh more than 160 kilograms. They have previously been exhibited in Japan at the Ueno Zoo and Sapporo Maruyama Zoo in Hokkaido, according to Nagoya city.",

    "text": "La billetera digital dale!, que ya está cerca de los 3,5 millones de clientes, amplió de forma exponencial los productos y servicios expuestos en su plataforma durante 2024.\nCon el cambio de infraestructura transaccional llevado a cabo en 2023, dale! ha reducido significativamente el time to market de nuevos desarrollos, con una plataforma más estable y disponible que la de sus competidores , garantizando los más altos estándares de seguridad.\nLa billetera digital dale! dijo que en el primer semestre de 2024 incorporó la vinculación de jóvenes a partir de los 12 años, el pago de más de 22.000 servicios públicos y privados, la posibilidad de hacer donaciones a causas sociales, pagos con código QR interoperable y sin contacto con tecnología NFC.\nDurante el segundo semestre de 2024, se habilitaron la recepción de remesas internacionales, la solicitud de créditos de libre inversión en alianza con Banco de Bogotá, la creación de bolsillos de ahorro (alcancías), así como la generación de códigos QR interoperables y un marketplace de proveedores que permite el pago directo de facturas para pequeños comercios.\nTodo ello ha hecho que la transacionalidad de dale! se incremente en 218% en 2024, con una excelente adopción de los nuevos servicios por parte de los clientes. A un mes desde su lanzamiento, ya se han recibido más de $200 millones en remesas, colocado más de $600 millones en créditos con Banco de Bogotá (próximamente también con Banco AV Villas) y creado más de 2.000 alcancías.\nPara los pequeños comercios y emprendimientos, se acaba de lanzar la generación de código QR interoperable y un marketplace para pagos a proveedores, soluciones que facilitarán el día a día a los 500.000 pequeños negocios que ya se encuentran vinculados a dale! . Adicionalmente, la transaccionalidad de dale! se ha visto impulsada con el uso de la red de más de 28.000 corresponsales bancarios para realizar recargas del depósito electrónico, que han experimentado un crecimiento de 524% en lo que va de año vs. 2023, lo que refleja como dale! está contribuyendo activamente a la digitalización del efectivo. José Manuel Ayerbe, CEO de la billetera digital dale! Cortesía “Para nosotros es fundamental tanto realizar evolutivos de las funcionalidades existentes como lanzar nuevos productos, siempre pensando en traer soluciones que mejoren la experiencia y la relación del cliente con dale!. Estamos seguros de que en nuestra billetera encontrarán una herramienta para cubrir todas las necesidades financieras de su día a día, con diferentes transacciones inmediatas, interoperables y gratuitas, que disminuyan el uso del efectivo”, afirmó José Manuel Ayerbe, CEO de dale!.\nLa billetera digital continúa trabajando en mejorar su servicio. Próximamente se anunciará la vinculación de extranjeros y otros productos como la contratación de fiducias, nuevas modalidades de ahorro remunerado y en dólares digitales, así como más opciones de crédito con otras entidades de Grupo Aval y terceros. También se encuentran desarrollando el sistema de pagos inmediatos Bre-B, respecto del cual tienen grandes expectativas, pues supondrá un avance como país en términos de interoperabilidad e inclusión.
