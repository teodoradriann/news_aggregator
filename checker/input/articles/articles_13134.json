    "text": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Thursday spilled the beans on being a philanthropist and giving away his wealth saying that he always knew that he would have to learn how to be a philanthropist and found things like vaccines for malaria or malnutrition due to the wealth generated from his company.\nIn an interview to news agency ANI, the tech boss said that he finds himself lucky that Microsoft was so successful that it generated gigantic wealth and through partnerships, governments, and money, he could help to eliminate the persisting problems.\n\"I'm very lucky that Microsoft was so successful. It generated gigantic wealth and I was able to find things like vaccines of malaria or malnutrition that would not be solved without philanthropy. That is, you know, people are malnourished. It's not a big enough market that, you know, companies were responding to that. And so, through partnerships with governments, I see a path to really eliminate a lot of these awful problems,\" he said.\n#WATCH | On being asked why he is giving away his wealth, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says, \"I'm lucky that Microsoft was so successful that it generated gigantic wealth, and I was able to find things like vaccines for malaria or malnutrition that would not be solved without… pic.twitter.com/ZBUUlDa143\n— ANI (@ANI) February 29, 2024 \\n\\n\nGates also mentioned that he lets his kids have some money to be comfortable but he doesn't need money for his own spending.\n\"Well, you know, I'll let my kids have some money so that they're comfortable. But, I don't need the money for my own spending and I think, having a limited amount be inherited means that the rest of it's available to give back to society and try to improve things as much as possible,\" he added.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation co-founder further said that he has never faced the problems of financial crisis as he belonged to an upper-middle-class family.\n\"Well, when I started, I was in an upper-middle-class family, so I've never been in what you'd call tough circumstances. My parents sent me to a great private school. When I dropped out of Harvard, I could have gone back at any time and as soon as Microsoft was successful, I wasn't going to spend that money because I was working all the time and that was my big focus. So I always knew that I would have to learn how to be a philanthropist. I didn't really figure it out until the year 2000, and that's when I created the Gates Foundation, and it became the largest in the world,\" he added.\nMicrosoft ex-CEO, who is on a tour to India, on Wednesday, paid a visit to a slum in Odisha's Bhubaneswar on Wednesday and interacted with the people living there. The philanthropist also asked the slum residents about the changes in their lifestyle as a result of the welfare schemes. \"He asked about how we were living earlier and our present status,\" a slum resident said.\nEarlier today, he along with union minister Smriti Irani attended the \"Poshan Utsav - Celebrating Nutrition\" event and addressed the students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, on Artificial intelligence. Gates also has an invitation to attend Anant Ambani's pre-wedding bash in Gujarat's Jamnagar.\n(With inputs from ANI)\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "title": "The Future of Mobile App Development: What to Expect in the Next 5 Years",
    "text": "Mobile app development has come a long way over the past decade, and as technology continues to evolve, the future of mobile apps holds even more potential. With billions of smartphones in use globally, the demand for innovative, secure, and user-friendly apps is growing at an exponential rate. As businesses, developers, and users look ahead, the next five years are set to bring transformative changes in how apps are created, deployed, and experienced.\nThis article will explore The Future of Mobile App Development, highlighting key trends, technologies, and practices that are expected to shape the industry over the coming years.\nIncreased Focus on User Experience (UX) and Design In the next five years, user experience (UX) will continue to dominate mobile app development. With so many apps available in the market, providing an intuitive and seamless user experience will be essential to stand out from the competition.\nWhat Will Change? Simplified interfaces : Developers will increasingly prioritize minimalistic and functional designs, ensuring apps are easy to navigate with a focus on accessibility for all users. Personalization : Apps will deliver highly personalized experiences based on user behavior, preferences, and feedback. This will result in better engagement and retention rates as users feel more connected to the app. For developers, understanding UX will be more than just about visuals—it will be about creating an emotional connection between the app and the user. In the future of mobile app development , apps that can anticipate user needs and provide real-time solutions will see the greatest success.\nPerformance and Speed Optimization In today’s fast-paced world, no one has the patience for slow-loading apps. Over the next five years, mobile apps will be increasingly optimized for performance, ensuring they load quickly and operate smoothly across all devices.\nKey Areas of Improvement:\nLighter Apps : App sizes will decrease without compromising functionality, making them quicker to download and easier to use on low-storage devices. Better Resource Management : Developers will create apps that consume fewer resources, such as data and battery, making them more efficient and user-friendly. Offline Capabilities : More apps will offer offline functionality, allowing users to access essential features even without an internet connection. These optimizations will not only improve the user experience but will also be critical in regions with slower internet speeds or limited access to high-end devices. In The Future of Mobile App Development, delivering apps that perform well, regardless of the device or network conditions, will be essential.\nGrowing Importance of Security and Privacy As mobile app usage increases, so do concerns about privacy and data security. In the next five years, developers will face increasing pressure to ensure that their apps are secure and compliant with global regulations. Users are becoming more aware of how their data is collected, stored, and used, and any breach of trust can lead to massive reputational damage.\nKey Security Measures: Stronger Encryption Protocols : Apps will adopt more robust encryption methods to protect user data, ensuring it remains secure during transmission and storage. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) : Apps will increasingly implement 2FA and biometric verification (such as fingerprint or facial recognition) to add an extra layer of security. Data Transparency : Developers will need to provide clear and transparent data usage policies, giving users full control over their personal information. As cybersecurity threats evolve, The Future of Mobile App Development will require continuous updates to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities. Users will choose apps that prioritize their security and offer reassurance that their personal information is protected.\nCross-Platform Development Will Become the Norm One of the most significant changes in The Future of Mobile App Development will be the rise of cross-platform development. Traditionally, developers created separate apps for iOS and Android, but as development frameworks improve, creating a single app for multiple platforms will become standard.\nWhy This is Important: Cost and Time Efficiency : Cross-platform development allows developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, saving time and reducing development costs. Uniform User Experience : With a single codebase, developers can ensure that the app offers a consistent experience, whether a user is on an iPhone, Android, or even a web app. Faster Updates : Developers will be able to roll out updates simultaneously across platforms, ensuring that all users have access to new features and security patches at the same time. Cross-platform development tools like Flutter, React Native, and others will continue to mature, making it easier for developers to adopt this approach. Over the next five years, this will likely become the preferred method for most app development projects, providing a more streamlined and efficient process.\nThe Rise of Instant Apps Instant apps—apps that don’t need to be installed on a device to function—are expected to gain more traction in the coming years. These apps allow users to access key features without downloading the full application, which can significantly enhance the user experience.\nBenefits of Instant Apps: No Installation Required : Users can quickly access app features without the need for storage space, making instant apps ideal for trial versions or specific functionalities. Faster Engagement : Instant apps can be used immediately, allowing businesses to capture users’ attention more effectively and encourage conversion. Reduced Friction : Since there’s no need for a full download, users are more likely to try out an app, leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction. In The Future of Mobile App Development, instant apps will become more prevalent as users demand faster access to services without the hassle of installation. This shift will also allow businesses to attract new users by offering a quick, seamless experience.\nIntegration with Wearables and Other Devices The integration of mobile apps with wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, will continue to grow in the next five years. As more people adopt wearable technology, apps will need to offer seamless integration to enhance the user experience.\nWhat To Expect: Health and Fitness Apps : Apps that sync with fitness trackers will become more sophisticated, offering real-time data and personalized insights directly on wearable devices. Smart Home Integration : More apps will integrate with smart home devices, allowing users to control everything from lighting to security systems via their mobile apps. Interoperability : As more devices connect to the Internet of Things (IoT), apps will need to interact with a wide range of devices, ensuring a smooth and interconnected experience. The Future of Mobile App Development will not be confined to smartphones alone. Developers will need to consider how their apps can interact with other devices in the ecosystem to provide users with a holistic experience.\nGreater Emphasis on Sustainability Sustainability is becoming a critical factor in all areas of business, and mobile app development is no exception. In the coming years, developers will be more conscious of their app’s environmental footprint and look for ways to reduce energy consumption.\nSustainable Development Practices: Energy-efficient Coding : Developers will focus on writing code that minimizes battery usage, especially for resource-heavy apps such as games or video streaming services. Eco-friendly Hosting : As more apps rely on cloud-based services, developers will seek out eco-friendly hosting providers that use renewable energy to power their data centers. User Awareness : Apps will provide users with tools to monitor and reduce their own environmental impact, such as tracking energy usage or promoting sustainable habits. Sustainability is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In The Future of Mobile App Development, developers who prioritize eco-friendly practices will not only appeal to environmentally conscious users but also contribute to a healthier planet.\nConclusion The Future of Mobile App Development is full of exciting possibilities. From improved user experiences and increased security to cross-platform solutions and wearable integration, the next five years will bring innovations that reshape how we use and interact with apps. Developers who stay ahead of these trends will be best positioned to create the apps of tomorrow, delivering functionality, speed, and convenience for users around the world.\nFor businesses and developers alike, the key to success will be staying adaptable, focusing on user needs, and embracing the new technologies that drive the future of mobile apps. As the landscape evolves, those who prioritize performance, security, and user experience will continue to thrive in this ever-changing digital world.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Rex Clementine\nat Pallekele\nSri Lanka suffered a major blow ahead of the three match T-20 series against India when fast bowler Nuwan Thushara was ruled out of the three games with a fractured finger. The hosts had already lost leader of the attack Dushmantha Chameera before coming to Kandy due to illness and will head into the series against the World Champions with a depleted attack.\nThe first T-20 International gets underway on Saturday. The second game is on Sunday followed by the third game on Tuesday. All matches will be played at Pallekele International Stadium.\nRight-arm seamer Asitha Fernando was drafted into the side in place of Chameera while left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka has been rushed to Kandy to replace Thushara.\nThushara had sustained the injury while doing fielding drills on Wednesday.\nSri Lanka had a training session at Pallekele on Thursday evening as well while India were scheduled to train later in the day with newly appointed Head Coach Gautam Gambhir set to address the media prior to training.\nIndia are a new look side without Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja, who all retired after they were crowned World Champions in Barbados having beaten South Africa in the T-20 World Cup final last month.\nThe tourists also have left out Jasprit Bumrah, but still their pace attack looks quite formidable on paper.\nIndian selectors sprung a huge surprise by naming Suryakumar Yadav as captain of the T-20 side ahead of Hardik Pandya. The all-rounder had been understudy to Rohit Sharma and had captained India in the absence of Rohit. He was also vice-captain of the side that won the T-20 World Cup in May.\nRohit and Kohli will return to the ODI side when the teams get back to Colombo for the 50 over leg of the tour.\nTickets were selling out fast at Pallekele and a full house is expected for all three games. When Sri Lanka hosted Afghanistan in a three match ODI series in March, the matches were played in front of sell out crowds.\nThe Sri Lankans are going into the series with lot of momentum behind them with several players excelling in the Lanka Premier League (LPL).\nSri Lanka’s selectors recalled Avishka Fernando and Kusal Perera after overlooking them for the recent World Cup in the Caribbean and USA. Both players were in good nick during the LPL. Veteran Dinesh Chandimal is also back in the T-20 side having last played in this format in 2022.",

    "title": "Circolarità degli imballaggi, energia da rinnovabili e cittadinanza attiva: il percorso di Coca-Cola HBC Italia verso la sostenibilità - Open",
    "text": "Vent’anni di progetti e investimenti per un obiettivo ben preciso: rendere la propria attività sempre più sostenibile e in armonia con l’ambiente, le comunità locali e i propri dipendenti. Coca-Cola Hbc Italia, principale produttore e distributore di prodotti a marchio Coca-Cola sul territorio nazionale, ha pubblicato il suo 20esimo Bilancio di Sostenibilità. Un’occasione per fare il punto sulle diverse iniziative aziendali promosse negli ultimi anni, ma anche per svelare come il gruppo intende rispettare le proprie promesse sul taglio delle emissioni. Coca-Cola Hbc si è impegnata infatti a raggiungere le zero emissioni nette lungo tutta la catena del valore entro il 2040. «La sostenibilità è la lente attraverso la quale programmiamo la nostra crescita», spiega Giangiacomo Pierini, Corporate Affairs & Sustainability Director di Coca-Cola HBC Italia. «È un impegno quotidiano e concreto che travalica i confini dei processi produttivi e – aggiunge il direttore – definisce un modello operativo, ma anche un valore che ci unisce come colleghi». Il percorso verso la sostenibilità Coca-Cola Hbc Italia conta oltre 2mila dipendenti, 1.300 fornitori e sei stabilimenti produttivi, distribuiti in cinque regioni. Il primo bilancio di sostenibilità dell’azienda risale al 2004, ben prima che il tema giungesse al centro del dibattito pubblico. Nel 2021 l’azienda ha iniziato un percorso per raggiungere la neutralità carbonica entro il 2040, con 250 milioni di euro già investiti entro il 2025 in progetti come l’utilizzo di fonti rinnovabili per la produzione di energia elettrica, la circolarità degli imballaggi, le frigovetrine eco-friendly e la decarbonizzazione della flotta auto. La strategia di Coca-Cola Hbc Italia verso la piena sostenibilità si muove lungo tre direttrici: ambiente, persone e comunità. Per ognuno di questi ambiti, il gruppo può vantare un lungo elenco di iniziative e progetti: alcuni già realizzati, altri ancora in corso d’opera. «Sentiamo la responsabilità di essere leader di settore», spiega Pierini. «Siamo consapevoli che le innovazioni e la direzione con cui conduciamo il nostro business possono avere un impatto sugli altri attori della filiera, in particolare sulle oltre 1600 imprese, prevalentemente PMI e micro-aziende, che collaborano con noi». Ambiente | Circolarità degli imballaggi e riduzione delle emissioni Quando si parla di sostenibilità, il primo pensiero va all’ambiente. Nel Bilancio recentemente pubblicato, l’azienda ha rendicontato le proprie performance ambientali per ridurre – e, in prospettiva, azzerare – il proprio impatto sull’ambiente. «Il fronte su cui probabilmente siamo più avanti è senza dubbio quello del packaging», fa notare Pierini. La conversione di tutte le bottiglie in plastica al 100% PET riciclato nel 2023 ha permesso infatti a Coca-Cola Hbc Italia di raggiungere con largo anticipo gli obiettivi europei fissati dalla Direttiva sulla plastica monouso per il 2025 e il 2030. Oltre alle innovazioni tecniche sul packaging, come la rimozione nel 2020 degli imballaggi in plastica per le confezioni multiple di lattine o la continua riduzione della quantità di materiale usato per gli imballaggi, l’azienda è impegnata in progetti di sensibilizzazione per coinvolgere i consumatori in una cultura del riciclo e rispetto delle risorse «Ogni anno rafforziamo i nostri rapporti con i consorzi di riciclo, come il Conai o il Coripet, promuovendo con loro attività di sensibilizzazione sulla circolarità e di raccolta delle confezioni», racconta il direttore. Accanto a tutte queste iniziative, ci sono poi gli investimenti sul territorio. Uno degli esempi più virtuosi è senz’altro la vicenda che ha riguardato la fabbrica di Gaglianico, in provincia di Biella. Nel 2022, Coca-Cola Hbc Italia ha riaperto lo stabilimento, in disuso da otto anni, per trasformarlo in un polo all’avanguardia mondiale per la lavorazione del PET riciclato ad uso alimentare e dare lavoro a oltre 60 persone altamente specializzate. Una «scommessa vinta», secondo Giangiacomo Pierini, che aggiunge: «Non abbiamo solo riportato posti di lavoro e flusso economico nel territorio, ma abbiamo reso la fabbrica un motivo di orgoglio per la comunità locale, in prima linea sulla sfida ambientale europea». Complessivamente, l’azienda ha registrato una diminuzione del 38% delle intensità di emissione CO2 rispetto al 2010. Questo grazie agli impianti fotovoltaici, ai sistemi per la produzione indipendente di energia presenti nelle fabbriche e alla conversione all’elettrico della flotta auto dell’azienda. Pierini aggiunge che «per costruire davvero un business sostenibile, occorre portare innovazione anche nella filiera all’esterno delle proprie fabbriche». Per questo motivo, ad esempio, lo scorso anno l’azienda ha fornito a bar, ristoranti e supermercati altre 26mila nuove frigovetrine ecofriendly. Oggi il 70,2% delle frigovetrine dell’azienda presenti sul mercato sono ad alta efficienza energetica, facendo risparmiare al settore 107.9 milioni di KWh di energia elettrica rispetto all’utilizzo di frigoriferi tradizionali. Persone | Valorizzazione dei talenti, inclusione e work-life balance La sostenibilità, però, non riguarda esclusivamente l’ambiente. Ed è per questo che il secondo capitolo del Bilancio di Coca-Cola Hbc Italia è dedicato alle «persone», vale a dire agli oltre 2mila dipendenti del gruppo in Italia. Anche in questo caso sono tante le iniziative promosse negli anni, anche anticipando tematiche e innovazioni in aree come l’inclusione e la tutela dei lavoratori. Dal 2008, per esempio, l’azienda ha inserito nell’accordo sindacale un piano sanitario ad hoc per tutti i dipendenti. Nel 2013 e 2014 sono state introdotte la monotimbratura e il remote working, ossia la timbratura del cartellino una sola volta al giorno e la possibilità di lavorare da casa, per una gestione più indipendente dell’equilibrio vita-lavoro. In un primo momento, sono stati concessi tre giorni al mese, estesi gradualmente fino agli attuali dodici. Nel 2015, un anno prima dell’approvazione della legge sulle unioni civili, Coca-Cola Hbc ha esteso il congedo matrimoniale e l’assistenza sanitaria anche alle coppie dello stesso sesso. Tutte queste iniziative hanno permesso all’azienda di ricevere nel 2016 la sua prima (ma non ultima) certificazione Top Employer Italia, che premia le aziende che si distinguono per l’approccio alle persone. Le iniziative a favore dei dipendenti sono proseguite anche negli anni successivi. Nel 2019, per esempio, è stata introdotta una piattaforma di welfare che consente ai dipendenti di convertire il premio di produzione annuale in numerosi servizi, come i rimborsi per le spese mediche o l’educazione. Due anni più tardi è stato svelato il piano Zero is possible, che punta a garantire un ambiente di lavoro sempre più sicuro, fino ad arrivare a zero infortuni. Nel 2022, Coca-Cola Hbc Italia ha ottenuto anche la certificazione per la parità di genere da parte di Idem, che premia proprio i percorsi aziendali orientati alla valorizzazione dei talenti al femminile. Comunità | Progetti benefici, inclusione, scommessa sui giovani L’ultimo capitolo del Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2024 di Coca-Cola Hbc Italia è dedicato alla «comunità», ossia alle esternalità positive prodotte dall’azienda nei territori in cui opera. Una delle prime iniziative in tal senso risale a quasi trent’anni fa. Nel 1995, infatti, l’azienda ha indetto la prima edizione delle Special Olympics, un appuntamento pensato per sostenere le persone con disabilità intellettive nello sport. Dal 2005 è attiva inoltre una collaborazione con Banco Alimentare, con l’obiettivo di contrastare lo spreco alimentare e aiutare le persone in difficoltà. Dal 2018, Coca-Cola Hbc Italia sostiene la comunità Lgbtq+ attraverso la partecipazione al Pride di Milano, Napoli, Torino e Padova. Il gruppo supporta inoltre quattro case-famiglia ed eroga corsi di formazione ai propri dipendenti per scardinare i pregiudizi inconsapevoli e rendere i luoghi di lavoro sempre più inclusivi. Nel 2020, poco dopo lo scoppio della pandemia da Covid-19, Coca-Cola Hbc Italia ha donato 1,4 milioni di euro alla Croce Rossa Italiana contribuendo all’acquisto di ambulanze e dispositivi medici. Un’azione che, tre anni più tardi, ha consentito all’azienda di ricevere la medaglia di benemerenza per il supporto fornito alla comunità abruzzese durante l’emergenza Coronavirus. C’è poi il focus dedicato ai giovani. Nel 2017 sono partiti i primi programmi di Youth Empowered, che aiuta gli studenti ad affrontare al meglio l’ingresso nel mondo del lavoro attraverso corsi di formazione e workshop accessibili online. Soltanto nel 2023, 48mila giovani sono stati coinvolti nel progetto. Un programma a cui si aggiungono anche tante altre iniziative realizzate insieme ad alcuni partner, come Junior Achievement, la più vasta organizzazione no profit al mondo dedicata all’educazione economico-imprenditoriale dei più giovani. La collaborazione esclude la sezione Fact-checking di Open, la quale opera in totale autonomia. Foto di copertina: Un pallone pubblicitario di Coca-Cola a Varsavia (Dreamstime/Grand Warszawski)",

    "text": "by Riley Fannon\nFri, January 3rd 2025 at 6:45 PM 7 VIEW ALL PHOTOS All of Mid-Missouri is under a Winter Storm Watch from 6pm Saturday to 3am Monday. (KRCG 13) TOPICS:\nWinter Storm Mid-Missouri Freezing Rain Snow Accumulation Ice Accumulations Travel Hazards Interstate 70 Weather Alerts Winter weather alerts stretch from Kansas to Pennsylvania ahead of a major winter storm this weekend and Mid-Missouri could face significant impacts. Freezing rain, sleet and snow all look possible with this storm, and they could make travel hazardous beginning Saturday night through Sunday. As of Thursday evening, the energy associated with this storm was still over the Pacific Ocean so changes to the path of the storm and ice and snow accumulations can still occur.\nThat said, all signs continue to point to this as a highly impactful storm.\nCold air ahead of the storm will mean accumulation will not be hindered for Mid-Missouri.\nThe preliminary forecasts for the region indicate areas along and north of Interstate 70 seeing lower ice totals with higher snow totals. Areas south of Interstate 70 to the Lake of the Ozarks could see more significant ice accumulations with lower snowfall totals.\nFrom the border with Iowa to the Interstate 70 corridor, up to a foot of snow looks possible with some isolated amounts over a foot not out of the question, especially as you get closer to the border with Iowa. As you get closer to the Interstate uncertainty increases as the likelihood of seeing freezing rain and then snow will be more common. South of the Interstate to the lake there is a much greater concern for an extended period of freezing rain and sleet before a change to snow. This could lead to areas south of the Interstate receiving a quarter of an inch to half of an inch or more of ice before the snow starts to fall. The timing of the storm looks to begin late Saturday afternoon/early Saturday evening from west to east. Travel late Saturday night throughout Sunday will be impacted and you'll be encouraged to avoid travel unless necessary. By Sunday evening, all areas of Mid-Missouri look to have made the transition to all snow but strong wind gusts could create blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions. Areas affected the hardest by the ice accumulation could see elevated power outage concerns as the strong winds move in. Your KRCG 13 Weather Authority team will be tracking this storm and will continue to update you on air and online throughout this event so stay tuned in for the latest information.\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.

    "text": "记者今天(3月13日)从 中国石油 （ 601857 ）获悉，我国最大超深油气生产基地——塔里木油田，已累计从6000米以下地层采出油气1.5亿吨油气当量，相当于去年全国油气产量的37%。\n　　超深层油气产量逐日增长，这就是“中国深度”！\n　　在油气开发中，国际上一般将埋深超过4500米的地层称为深层，而埋深超过6000米被称为超深层。今年前两个月，塔里木油田加速超深层油气开发，从中采出油气当量突破300万吨，超深层油气产量逐日增长，成为增储上产主力。\n　　中国石油塔里木油田勘探开发研究院高级工程师赵龙飞：今年我们继续向沙漠深层超深层拓展，目前已经完成61口超深井的部署，其中36口井已经上钻，19口井已经钻开了油层。\n　　塔里木盆地是我国面积最大的含油气盆地，超深油气资源储量丰富。我国首口超万米科探井——深地塔科1井日前在这里钻到了地下10910米，在全球范围内首次发现地下万米的油气资源，为深地资源开发利用提供了坚实支撑。\n　　中国石油塔里木油田企业首席专家王春生：在我们整个塔里木盆地，有六大区域在万米之下，有油气的可能性，这进行了进一步验证，为我们塔里木盆地再找大油气田打下了一个坚实的基础。\n　　经过几十年的开发，老油田储量递减、开采难度加大，我国新增油气的储量主要来源于深层。目前，塔里木油田在天山南麓及塔克拉玛干沙漠腹地已建成五个深层、超深层石油、天然气主力产区。\n　　 我国最大超深原油上产区加快建设步伐\n　　位于塔克拉玛干沙漠腹地的塔里木油田富满油区，是我国目前最大的超深原油上产区。近年来，随着科技进步，超深钻井技术不断取得突破，钻井纪录多次被刷新。\n　　位于新疆沙雅县的满深72-H10日前顺利完钻，完钻周期81天，刷新国内陆上8500米以深井最快完钻纪录。\n　　中国石油渤海钻探库尔勒分公司钻井队平台经理孙谦：期间，我们一只钻头向地下钻进2906米，创造了钻井新速度，钻完8500米深井，比之前的区块最快周期提前了2天完成钻井任务。\n　　塔里木油田富满油区的油气资源量超10亿吨，但这些油气大多埋藏在地下七八千米的地层深处，塔里木油田依靠科技创新，加快获取超深油气，今年计划在这里建成500万吨大油田。\n　　中国石油塔里木油田油气田产能建设事业部袁野：通过钻井提速攻关，我们相比预定钻井周期节省了52天，2025年我们通过优化各区块不同井型的提速模板，力争8000米深井全面实现百日内完井。\n　　 两条能源大动脉开建今年底贯通投运\n　　塔里木油田在加快提高产能的同时，能源通道建设也在同步加快推进。新疆重点民生工程——气化南疆天然气管道工程英买力至三岔、轮南至上库工业园区两条天然气管道日前同步开建，年底贯通投运后，将实现塔里木盆地主力气田和南疆主干供气管网的互联互通。\n　　设计全长510公里的管道工程，分东西两路，沿着天山南麓不断拓展延伸。西侧的英买力至三岔天然气管道，起于阿克苏地区新和县，途经阿克苏、柯坪等县市，直至382公里外的巴楚县三岔口镇，每日供气规模达720万立方米。东侧的轮南至上库天然气管道，起点位于轮台县轮南镇，终点位于库尔勒市上库工业园区，管道长度128公里，每日供气规模达2040万立方米。\n　　中国石油塔里木油田油气运销事业部执行董事常桂川：本次管道建成投产后，将实现新建管道与已建南疆天然气供气管网的双线供气，大幅提升南疆天然气保供能力，对助力南疆经济社会高质量发展具有重大意义。\n　　气化南疆天然气管道工程是新疆天然气利民管道扩建工程的重要组成部分，总体工程规划全长2108公里，计划分三批次实施。\n　　(总台央视记者朱江张伟)",
