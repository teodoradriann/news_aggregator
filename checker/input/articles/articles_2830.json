    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm) says infection rates of flu and COVID-19 are on the rise. Here in San Antonio, University Health says they are also seeing an increase. According to statistics shared to KENS 5 by University Health both flu and covid-19 infection rates, have been on the rise since the end of November. The New Year holiday could impact those numbers and lead to an even bigger increase in cases, especially with large gatherings. \"We've seen a significant increase, particularly influenza both flu A, and flu B.\" Dr. Bryan Alsip, Chief Medical Officer at University Health said. University Health is also seeing an increase in outpatient samples for COVID-19. According to the CDC, the new COVID-19 variants JN-1, is making up 44% of new COVID-19 cases. One silver lining when it comes to respiratory illnesses is RSV cases are down nationally and locally. Alsip said that could be a reflection of the RSV vaccine. \"We still have one for influenza. It's not too late to get your flu shot,\" Alsip added. Dr. Alsip also reminds people to get a COVID-19 vaccine. He said having good hygiene will help when it comes to viruses transmitted person to person. Alsip urges people to consider wearing a mask, especially if you're going to be in large groups where you can't control the environment. \"Maybe if your immunocompromised, or have you know serious underlying medical conditions, even think more carefully about whether you want to put yourself at risk in those settings,\" Alsip said.

    "text": "After losing to Longview the last time they met, Rockwall-Heath decided to demonstrate that turnabout is fair play. The Rockwall-Heath Hawks walked away with a 52-43 win over the Longview Lobos on Friday. Given the Hawks' advantage in MaxPreps' Texas basketball rankings (they are ranked 82nd, while the Lobos are ranked 373rd), the result wasn't entirely unexpected.\nKaleb Turner-Dicus was his usual excellent self, going 7 of 16 on his way to 17 points in addition to five rebounds and three steals. Another player making a difference was Jaden Jackson, who posted 11 points and five boards.\nHawks\nPrevious 2 Games\nRockwall-Heath smashed the offensive glass and finished the game with 12 offensive boards. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now pulled down at least nine offensive rebounds in eight consecutive matches.\nDespite the loss, Longview still got an impressive performance from Demarion Williams, who went 6 for 11 en route to 16 points and seven rebounds. The contest was Williams' third in a row with at least ten points. The team also got some help courtesy of Jeffery Smith, who put up eight points.\nRockwall-Heath is on a roll lately: they've won nine of their last 11 games, which provided a nice bump to their 18-5 record this season. As for Longview, the loss snapped their winning streak at five games and leaves them with a 12-8 record.\nRockwall-Heath wasted no time getting back out on the court and has already played their next matchup, a 56-52 victory against Rockwall on the 7th. Longview has also already played their next contest, a 52-44 win against North Forney on the 7th.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",

    "text": "The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement with the Centre and the Assam government on Friday in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The ULFA is the oldest insurgent group in Assam. After the peace accords were signed, Amit Shah said, \"It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam. For a long time, Assam and the Northeast faced violence.\"He added that ULFA signing the memorandum signals the start of a new period of peace for the entire Northeast and especially for Assam. Amit Shah said the state has been suffering for a long time due to the violence involving the insurgent group and 10,000 people have been killed in such violence since 1979. \"I want to assure ULFA representatives that the faith you have kept in the government of India, from the Ministry of Home Affairs's side, a programme will be made in a time-bound manner to fulfil everything, without you having to ask for it,\" said the Union Home Minister. He added that a committee will be formed under the Home Ministry which will work with the Assam government to fulfil the agreements under the memorandum. Himanta Biswa Sarma also called it a \"historic day\" for Assam and said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure, nearly 8,756 members of militant organisations have joined the mainstream.Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Dec 29, 2023",

    "text": "“Lo único que necesitas es a Jesús”: Jonathan Roumie habla de su interpretación de Jesús en “The Chosen” y su mayor oración por EE. UU.\nEl actor Jonathan Roumie se convirtió en una sensación mundial después de que «Los elegidos», el drama televisivo sobre Jesús y sus discípulos, se convirtiera en un éxito masivo tras su estreno en 2017.\nRoumie, que interpreta a Cristo y actualmente está filmando la quinta temporada de la serie, es un favorito de los fans que ha ayudado a llevar a la pequeña pantalla algunos de los momentos más trascendentales del Nuevo Testamento.\nEl domingo le dijo a CBN News durante una entrevista en la alfombra roja de los\nKLOVE Fan Awards en Nashville, Tennessee, que interpretar a Jesús le ha hecho «querer parecerse más a [Cristo]» todos los días.\n“Cuanto más tiempo pasas con Él, más inevitable es que Él tenga un efecto en tu corazón, sin importar quién seas ni de dónde vengas”, dijo Roumie. “Incluso si ya eres un creyente como yo al participar en estos proyectos, esto simplemente profundiza, exponencialmente, tu deseo de conocerlo en un nivel mucho más espiritualmente fundamental, emocionalmente fundamental y físicamente fundamental”.\nComo todo lo demás, Roumie dijo que el papel de Jesús también ha traído algunos desafíos, citando la fama como una de esas luchas, particularmente en cómo la gente lo procesa.\n\"La forma en que las personas reciben el papel y cómo te reciben a ti cuando te conocen, parece como si la línea fuera borrosa\", dijo Roumie. \"Es parte de lo que exploro en mi documental, 'Jonathan & Jesus', más o menos... lo que eso significa y cómo se ve en tiempo real\".\nMás allá de eso, el actor dijo que también está el reto de «tratar de estar a la altura de las expectativas de Dios» al representar a Cristo en la pantalla.\nAunque Roumie dijo que puede ser «difícil a veces», él «no lo haría de otra manera».\nEn cuanto a la mayor oración del actor para Estados Unidos en este momento, animó a la gente a volverse al Señor.\n«Lo único que necesitas es Jesús», dijo. «Jesús es el príncipe de la paz. El único camino a la verdadera paz interior es Jesús».\nLa cuarta temporada de “The Chosen” fue nominada en la categoría Film Impact en los KLOVE Fan Awards de este año, que se transmitirán el viernes 31 de mayo a las 8 y 10 pm ET por TBN y TBN+.",

    "title": "ICE Sued for Withholding Info on Hiding Identities of Criminal Illegals",
    "text": "The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) is suing President Joe Biden’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for withholding internal agency information regarding its policy to hide the identities of criminal illegal aliens that agents arrest.\nOn Thursday, IRLI’s Dale Wilcox announced that the watchdog group is suing ICE after the agency failed to reply to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\nThat request asked ICE to hand over internal information and emails on how the agency decides when to reveal a criminal illegal alien’s identity in press releases.\nIRLI conducted an investigation last year which found that under former President Donald Trump, ICE named 97 percent of criminal illegal aliens identified in press releases while under Biden, only 67 percent of criminal illegal aliens are being named in press releases.\n“ICE’s sudden decision to omit the names of alien offenders from press releases appears to be a deliberate attempt to keep the public from determining whether dangerous foreign criminals have been removed from the United States,” IRLI’s Director of Investigations Matt O’Brien said in a statement. “That’s rather hypocritical coming from an administration that claims to be the most transparent in the history of the U.S.”\nMost recently, for example, ICE issued a press release that detailed the arrest of an unidentified 27-year-old illegal alien from Ecuador who has been convicted of second-degree assault and indecent assault of a child in Danbury, Connecticut.\nIn another, ICE detailed the case of a 32-year-old Dominican illegal alien who was convicted in Waterbury, Connecticut of trafficking cocaine. Despite the conviction, the illegal alien’s identity was not revealed.\nEven in the most egregious criminal cases, ICE refuses to name illegal alien suspects. For instance, a 20-year-old Brazilian national was arrested by the agency this month after he was charged with raping a child in Milford, Massachusetts. The man’s name was not provided.\n“This is yet another shameless attempt by the current administration to hide the disastrous impact of its immigration policies,” Wilcox said:\nNot including the names of criminal immigration violators is effectively flushing their cases down the memory hole so that watchdog groups will have a more difficult time holding this White House accountable for their destructive actions. The American people deserve transparency on this matter. [Emphasis added]\nThe case is Immigration Reform Law Institute v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , No. 24-cv-1101 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
