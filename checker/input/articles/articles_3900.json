    "text": "By Nora Eckert and Kalea Hall DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor plans to announce discounts across multiple models starting on Thursday, three sources said, leaning on its healthy inventory to offer customers thousands off their vehicles as some competitors have hiked prices to absorb added costs from tariffs. The Dearborn, Michigan, car company will offer its employee pricing, a discounted rate available to Ford workers, to all customers, the sources said. The program will be called the \"From America for America\" plan, one of the sources said. Ford declined to comment. The automaker said it builds 80% of its U.S.-sold vehicles domestically, buffering itself more from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs than some competitors. However, it is still facing the prospect of steep levies on imported vehicle parts. (Reporting by Nora Eckert; editing by Diane Craft)",

    "text": "He was First Team All-NCAA Tournament, First Team All-East Region, and First Team All-Big East. On Wednesday, Cam Spencer earned first team honors for his work in the classroom as well. The UConn men’s basketball standout was named a First Team 2023-34 Academic All-American by the College Sports Communicators (CSC). The graduate guard became the fourth Husky to earn CSC Academic All-American honors in program history, joining UConn legends Wes Bialosuknia (1966-67), Emeka Okafor (2002-03 and 03-04) and Randy LaVigne (1977-78). Earlier this week, the CSC announced UConn women’s basketball star Paige Bueckers had also been named a First Team Academic All-American. [UConn’s Paige Bueckers named First Team Academic All-American] Spencer is pursuing a certificate in nonprofit management at UConn, and holds a 3.50 GPA, according to the school. He finished his undergraduate time with a 3.80 GPA. On the court this season, Spencer ranked second on the team in scoring, averaging 14.3 points per game. He was among the national leaders in 3-point percentage, draining 3s at a 44% clip, and in assist-to-turnover ratio, notching a 3.63 per game average. He also averaged 4.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and a team-high 1.4 steals per game while starting all 40 games for the Huskies. The 24-year-old will leave UConn as the program record holder in free throw percentage after draining 91.1 percent for the season. Spencer helped UConn win a second straight national title by a record +140-point scoring margin and helped the Huskies set a program record with 37 wins.",

    "text": "A minor fire broke out in the Old Security Hold area of the Jayprakash Narayan International Airport in Patna on Thursday, officials said. The fire, which broke out near the airline ticketing counters, was promptly contained using on-site extinguishers. The Fire Control Room was immediately alerted by the CISF personnel and ATC Tower. According to airport officials, the fire broke out during steel-cutting work, caused by sparks from gas cutting, reported ANI. The Airport Fire Rescue Vehicle (AFRV) responded swiftly and brought the situation under control, they said. The airport director said in a statement that the fire had caused no damage or disruptions to airport operations. Aircraft movement also remained unaffected, he said. Patna Airport is the 20th busiest airport in India. The airport has not been handling any international operations since 1999 when the Indian Airlines Flight 814 was hijacked and taken to Kandahar on December 24. In May this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a new terminal which will accommodate 3,000 passengers at peak hours.",

    "text": "Republican States Sue Biden Administration Over Health Insurance for DACA Recipients Fifteen Republican-led states, spearheaded by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Biden administration from granting health insurance access to DACA recipients. The states argue this violates federal law by offering public benefits to individuals lacking legal immigration status. The lawsuit arrives amid heated immigration debates ahead of the 2024 presidential election. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 09-08-2024 02:35 IST | Created: 09-08-2024 02:35 IST Fifteen Republican-led states, led by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to block the Biden administration's plan to provide health insurance to up to 200,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The lawsuit challenges a May rule by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that classifies Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants as \"legally present\" in the U.S., allowing them access to healthcare programs under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Kansas and the other states claim the rule incentivizes illegal immigration by encouraging DACA recipients to remain in the U.S., thereby increasing states' public service costs. The White House and HHS have yet to comment. Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has mandated state officials to track medical care costs for illegal immigrants. (With inputs from agencies.)",
