    "title": "Feds release flood of conservation funding | Canada's National Observer: Climate News",
    "text": "Nearly $90 million in federal funding for a slew of nature conservation projects intended to reverse Canada’s biodiversity loss and protect more land and waters was announced Thursday.\nThe Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society’s British Columbia Chapter (CPAWS) celebrated the federal government’s news, which advances Canada’s goal to improve biodiversity and protect thirty per cent of lands and waters by 2030.\nThree separate projects totalling $49 million will be in British Columbia, federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault announced at a press conference in Whytecliff Park Beach in West Vancouver.\nGet daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * “This funding has the potential to make a massive impact by protecting ecologically and culturally important ecosystems that hold and sequester carbon while benefitting clean water, air and wildlife,” said Tori Ball, conservation director for the land and freshwater program with CPAWS-BC, in a press release.\nThe climate crisis and biodiversity crisis are inextricably linked . Climate change is one of the factors driving biodiversity loss, and unhealthy ecosystems reabsorb and store less carbon than healthy ones. Canada’s forests used to be a carbon “sink” that absorbed and stored more CO2 than it released, but with increasing wildfires and deforestation, it has instead become a carbon source. Governments around the world recognize that halting and reversing biodiversity loss is a necessary part of climate action and vice versa.\nThe largest individual share of funding — $37 million — goes to the BC Parks Foundation to keep intact thousands of hectares of carbon-rich ecosystems, such as grasslands, wetlands and mature forests. The roughly 4,000 hectares of private land targeted for purchase and protection will span Vancouver Island, the Southern Interior and Northern B.C., according to the federal government.\nCash for all the projects announced on July 18 come from the 10-year $1.4-billion Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund , established in 2021.\nThe Nature Trust of British Columbia will get more than $8 million to create 11 new protected areas on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, in the East Kootenays and in the Cariboo Region.\nAnother nearly $4.5 million goes to the Nuxalk Nation to avoid planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by buying and protecting culturally-significant private lands, which will include forests in the Great Bear Rainforest near Bella Coola.\n“This funding has the potential to make a massive impact by protecting ecologically and culturally important ecosystems that hold and sequester carbon while benefitting clean water, air and wildlife,” said Tori Ball @CPAWSbc #cdnpoli #conservation “As the original stewards of the land, the work of Nuxalkmc is grounded in the deep relationships we have with the land and waters and our commitment to protecting Nuxalk culture and language for the Putl’lt (those who are not yet born),” Blair Mack, elected councillor for Nuxalk Nation, said in a press release. “We work to protect, restore, and enhance the integrity of Nuxalk ancestral knowledge, practices, and governance.”\nIndigenous people protect 80 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity, despite comprising only six per cent of the global population.\nAnother Indigenous-led project headed by Fisher River Cree Nation received $5 million for conservation activities in the Interlakes region of Manitoba with its carbon-rich peatland and migratory bird habitat. The Métis Nation of Alberta got just shy of $5 million to protect roughly 450 hectares of land.\nThe Manitoba Habitat Conservancy will use $6 million to protect 1,200 hectares of biodiverse lands.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada told Canada’s National Observer it cannot disclose coordinates until the projects are completed because it could affect negotiations and land price.\nMost of the projects aim to buy private lands that might otherwise be converted or disturbed, which causes greenhouse gas emissions and ruins the ecosystem’s ability to store carbon. A New Brunswick-based charity called Community Forests International got $9 million to do just that.\nIn Ontario, the Kawartha Land Trust got $7 million to wrap up ongoing conservation work and Conservation Ontario got $1.5 million.\nThese conservation efforts will help species at-risk like Grizzly Bear, Southern Mountain Caribou , Chum and Coho salmon, Marbled Murrelet and Western Toad, among others.\nNatasha Bulowski / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer",

    "text": "Why is black haram in Islam?\nBlack is considered haram in Islam due to several reasons. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) advised to avoid black, and there are reports of threats of punishment associated with dyeing hair black. This ruling applies to both men and women. Islamic scholars believe that dyeing hair with black color obstructs water from reaching the roots of the hair during ablution, making it invalid.\nWhy black color is haram in Islam?\nIn Islam, the use of pure black dye is considered haram. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) advised to avoid black, and there are reports of threats of punishment associated with dyeing hair black. This ruling applies to both men and women.\nAre Muslims allowed to have black hair?\nNo, it is not permissible for Muslims to dye their hair black. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) advised against dyeing hair black, as it imitates the practice of the Jews. Muslims are advised not to imitate the practices of non-believers.\nWhy hair color is haram in Islam?\nAccording to the majority of Islamic scholars, dyeing hair with unnatural colors like blue, pink, purple, green, silver, etc., is considered haram. It is also forbidden to dye hair in multicolored patterns like the rainbow. The reasons for this ruling are that such hair colors do not look natural, draw unnecessary attention, and imitate the practices of non-believers.\nCan you pray with dyed hair?\nIt is allowed to use colors other than black to dye hair as long as the dye does not contain impure substances and does not prevent water from reaching the roots of the hair during ablution. If the dye creates a layer on the hair that hinders the passage of water, then both wudu (ablution) and salah (prayer) would be invalid.\nKia Baalon (HAIR) ko Kala (BLACK) Rang (COLOUR) ker saktay hain ??? By Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza\nNo information available.\nWhich hair color is halal in Islam?\nIn Islam, it is permissible for a woman to dye her hair any color other than black. However, it is important to avoid imitating the hair dyeing or cutting styles of non-believers, especially if they are exclusive and specific to them.\nWhich hair color is allowed in Islam?\nAnswering the question if namaz was permissible after applying color on hair, the seminary said that it was allowed to use colors other than black provided the color does not contain impure things and does not leave such a layer on the hair that prevents water from reaching the roots.\nCan you go to heaven with dyed hair?\nThe concept of going to heaven is not related to dyeing hair. It is believed that one’s actions and faith determine their destiny in the afterlife, not the color of their hair.\nIs black henna haram?\nBlack henna is not forbidden in Islam. It is a part of Sunnah (Prophet’s saying/doing) and is recommended to apply henna dye to cover grey hair. It is also a cultural practice to apply henna to hands and feet for special occasions like weddings.\nIs it haram to celebrate birthdays?\nAccording to Islamic scholars, birthdays are not directly prohibited, but they are not considered significant or religiously important in Islam. Muslims are discouraged from celebrating birthdays as they are considered secular holidays and do not have any religious significance.\nIs it haram to not wear Hijab?\nIn Islam, wearing hijab is strongly encouraged and recommended for women. It is considered an act of obedience to Allah and is associated with modesty and piety. However, whether it is considered haram or sinful to not wear the hijab is a matter of interpretation and personal conviction among Islamic scholars.\nIs black an Islamic colour?\nBlack is not specifically associated with Islam as an Islamic color. However, black is often preferred for clothing in Islamic culture due to its association with modesty and simplicity. Black is not prohibited in Islam but dyeing hair black is discouraged.\nWhat do Muslims wear black?\nMuslims may choose to wear black clothing due to its association with modesty, simplicity, and its practicality in hiding dirt and stains. It is not specific to Muslims, but black is a commonly chosen color by Muslims for clothing.\nCan you go to heaven with dyed hair?\nThe color of hair does not determine one’s eligibility to enter heaven in Islamic belief. The afterlife is determined by one’s faith, actions, and adherence to the teachings of Islam, not by the color of their hair. Hair dyeing, including dyed hair, is not a factor in Allah’s judgment and has no impact on one’s salvation.\nWhat is halal color?\nHalal hair dye refers to hair dye that does not contain any ingredients derived from animals. It is permissible for Muslims to use hair dye, as long as it does not contain any impure substances and does not hinder the passage of water during ablution.\nDoes black hair exist?\nYes, black hair exists. It is found in various ethnicities and races, including Oriental, African, Native American, and European. Black hair is a natural hair color that is genetically determined.\nCan I dye my hair blonde in Islam?\nIn Islam, it is permissible for Muslims to dye their hair blonde or any color other than black. The only restriction is to avoid imitating the hair dyeing styles of non-believers. Muslims are encouraged not to imitate the practices of non-believers in matters of personal appearance.\nAre songs haram in Islam?\nIslam has different perspectives on music, and there is no unanimous consensus on whether all songs are considered haram. While some Islamic scholars prohibit certain types of music, others allow music that adheres to specific guidelines. It is encouraged to seek guidance from knowledgeable Islamic scholars on this matter.\nIs it haram to have a dog?\nIn Islam, the ownership of dogs is allowed for specific purposes such as herding, farming, hunting, or protection. However, keeping dogs solely as pets or for trivial reasons is generally discouraged, although not necessarily considered haram.\nIs it halal to wish happy birthday?\nIn Islam, celebrating birthdays is not considered a religious obligation, and there is no specific ruling on wishing someone a happy birthday. It is generally permissible to greet someone on their birthday, as long as the intention and manner of celebration do not involve any prohibited or inappropriate activities according to Islamic teachings.",

(WDBJ) - The U.S. Department of Interior’s National Park Service (NPS) has designated Bedford County as a World War II Heritage City. U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) [wrote a letter to the National Park Service in September](https://www.wdbj7.com/2023/09/06/kaine-asks-national-park-service-give-wwii-heritage-city-status-bedford-county/) requesting that the county be given the designation. “World War II was a defining period in American history, and Bedford County has been a vocal advocate for memorializing and preserving this history. As the site of the National D-Day Memorial and the homeplace of the Bedford Boys, this decision by NPS introduces the rest of the country to a foundational piece of World War II preservation efforts. I am proud to represent Virginia’s only World War II Heritage City and I applaud the years of hard work by Bedford County and others to make this designation possible,” said Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA).

La contribution sociale généralisée (CSG) est prélevée sur les salaires, les allocations chômage ou les pensions de retraites pour financer une partie de la protection sociale. Sur les retraites, quatre taux sont actuellement appliqués pour l&#039;année 2024: un taux zéro, un taux réduit (3,8 %), un taux médian (6,6 %) ainsi qu&#039;un taux normal (8,3 %) – le taux zéro concerne un revenu fiscal de référence inférieur à 12.230 euros pour une seule part fiscale. Dans son programme, le Nouveau Front populaire propose de la rendre &quot;progressive&quot;. &quot;Vous avez déposé un amendement pour mettre en place cette CSG progressive&quot; qui &quot;a été rejeté par l&#039;Assemblée nationale&quot;, a déclaré Gabriel Attal, s&#039;adressant au premier secrétaire du Parti socialiste, représentant du NFP pour le débat, et évoquant un amendement déposé par des députés socialistes et signé par Olivier Faure. Cet amendement, &quot;on l&#039;a mis à disposition des Français, il est en ligne, avec un simulateur&quot; pour que les retraités puissent &quot;voir l&#039;impact de la CSG progressive&quot; sur le montant des pensions, a affirmé Gabriel Attal. &quot;Une mesure de justice&quot; Cet amendement déposé en janvier 2023 propose d&#039;instaurer &quot;une CSG progressive avec 7 taux différents&quot;, allant de 0% en-dessous de 4.907 euros de revenus bruts annuels à 13,2% au-dessus de 79.800 euros, et de &quot;fondre les taux réduits différenciés pour les revenus issus des allocations chômage, des pensions de retraite dans ces tranches&quot;. Selon le simulateur créé par le camp macroniste, mis en ligne ce jeudi soir, un retraité perdrait, par exemple, 792 euros chaque année pour une pension mensuelle nette de 1.200 euros, si cet amendement était mis en œuvre. Le Premier secrétaire du PS a déploré un &quot;simulateur truqué&quot;, déclarant que &quot;nous ferons nous-mêmes nos propres simulations&quot;. &quot;La progressivité de l&#039;impôt est une mesure de justice. C&#039;est normal que les gens qui ont moins payent moins que ceux qui ont plus&quot; et qui &quot;payent plus&quot;, s&#039;est défendu Olivier Faure, pour qui &quot;ça ne coûtera rien du tout&quot; pour &quot;un petit retraité&quot;. Dans son programme, le Nouveau Front populaire propose bien d&#039;instaurer une CSG progressive, mais sans donner de détails à son sujet. Par ailleurs, en parallèle, l&#039;alliance de gauche propose également d&#039;indexer le montant des retraites sur les salaires, et de les indexer eux-mêmes sur l’inflation.",
