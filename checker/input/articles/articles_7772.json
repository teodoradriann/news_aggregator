The forecast predicts that bus and train services could be affected, while &apos;short term loss of power&apos; isn&apos;t unthinkable.\nNew Year&apos;s Eve won&apos;t be much better If you&apos;re travelling back from coastal areas after Christmas, spray and large waves are likely as well as the wind.\nThankfully, there are no weather warnings over London for New Year&apos;s Day, just a lot of rain.\nIn fact, BBC Weather forecasts a straight week of rain, with every day between January 1 and January 8 being wet and grey.

    "text": "Ravens RB Derrick Henry is embracing his new nickname Lightening McQueen from 'Cars'\nDerrick Henry is the king of rushing in the NFL, but Lamar Jackson blessed his teammate with a new name following the wild-card win over the Steelers.\nJackson indeed compared the speed of his backfield mate to an animated automobile.\n\"It looks like a movie clip,\" Lamar Jackson responded when asked what it feels like to be on the field with Henry.\n\"The movie 'Cars' … you know when Lightning McQueen is just flying and flashing past, and it's like [whooshing sound]. That's how Derrick looks when he was running past all those guys. … I'd rather be watching it than be on the other side of the ball, I know that.\"\nMcQueen, the protagonist of Disney/Pixar's Cars, is an anthropomorphic red stock car with yellow and orange lightning bolts painted on his body, and Derrick Henry embraces the name.\nHenry had 186 yards rushing on 26 carries last night (7.2 yards per carry average) and two touchdowns.",

    "text": "WOODSTOCK, CT ( WFSB /Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department shared photos on Facebook of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said. Some puppies will be taken to a veterinary office for further care. Drivers were warned to expect a “long duration road closure.” Copyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Israele sta valutando la possibilità di intraprendere un’azione militare contro l’Iran nei prossimi giorni, molto probabilmente senza il sostegno degli Stati Uniti. Lo riporta Nbc News, citando cinque persone informate sulla situazione. La notizia, che fa il giro del mondo, giunge mentre i negoziati fra Stati Uniti e Iran sul programma nucleare di Teheran sembrano avvicinarsi a un accordo preliminare o a un quadro che include disposizioni sull’arricchimento dell’uranio che Israele considera inaccettabili. Lo scrive Nbc, secondo cui i funzionari degli Usa e degli altri Paesi sono in allerta in attesa della possibilità dell’attacco israeliano.\nGli Usa prevedono che Teheran potrebbe reagire all’attacco di Israele prendendo di mira alcuni siti americani nel vicino Iraq, dunque questo – sottolinea Cbs – è uno dei motivi per cui il dipartimento di Stato Usa ha ordinato il ritiro dall’Iraq di tutto il personale non essenziale dell’ambasciata Usa a Baghdad. Un attacco o un’azione unilaterale di Israele contro l’Iran costituirebbe una rottura drammatica con l’amministrazione Trump, che si è opposta a tale mossa, evidenzia Nbc. L’amministrazione Trump è in attesa di una risposta dall’Iran in merito a una proposta di accordo sul nucleare e il presidente Usa repubblicano ha dichiarato pubblicamente che Teheran ha assunto una posizione più intransigente nei negoziati.\nQualche ora fa il presidente Usa Donald Trump, parlando al Kennedy Center, ha dichiarato che la mossa sul trasferimento del personale americano non essenziale è stata decisa perché la regione “potrebbe essere un luogo pericoloso, e vedremo cosa succederà”. “L’Iran non può avere un’arma nucleare”, ha ribadito ancora Trump. Ieri, ricorda Cbs News, il ministro della Difesa dell’Iran, Aziz Nasirzadeh, ha dichiarato ai giornalisti che se i colloqui sul nucleare falliranno e “ci verrà imposto un conflitto”, il Corpo delle Guardie Rivoluzionarie Islamiche “prenderà di mira tutte le basi statunitensi nei Paesi ospitanti”.",

    "text": "Hyderabad: The city continues to be drenched under heavy rains, leading to waterlogging in several parts. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for thunderstorms and lightning. Residents can expect a continuous spell of rain as IMD predicts week-long rainfall in the capital of Telangana.\nHyderabad Weather Forecast\nThe weather forecast for the upcoming week indicates a mix of conditions in the region. On May 9 and 10, a partly cloudy sky prevails with the potential for rain, thunderstorms, or dust storms. These atmospheric phenomena can be dynamic and may affect local weather patterns. On May 11, the weather remains consistent with partly cloudy skies and the possibility of rain, thunderstorms, or dust storms. However, the likelihood of these events is subject to local variations and atmospheric conditions. May 12th sees a shift towards clearer skies, with partly cloudy conditions prevailing. Finally, on May 13th, the forecast suggests partly cloudy skies with a heightened potential for moderate rain or thunderstorms.\nTelangana Weather Update\nAfter a bout of heavy rains and thunderstorms on Tuesday, the weather across the state has settled into a comparatively calmer pattern. IMD reported light to moderate rains in isolated areas of Adilabad, Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Rangareddy, and Sangareddy districts. Meanwhile, districts like Jagtial, Kamareddy, Medak, Rajanna Sircilla, Siddipet, and Vikarabad experienced moderate rains and thundershowers. Additionally, hailstorms were observed in isolated places across Adilabad, Medak, Mancherial, Kumurambheem Asifabad, Rajanna Sircilla, and Peddapalli districts.\nTemperatures also took a noticeable dip, with the highest maximum temperature remaining below 44 degrees Celsius. Nizamabad recorded the highest temperature at 42.9 degrees Celsius, while Hyderabad, the capital city, saw a maximum temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius in Rajendranagar.\nThe IMD reported a weather system affecting the region, with a trough extending from northeast Rajasthan to south interior Karnataka across central Maharashtra and north interior Karnataka at 0.9 km above mean sea level (MSL). This system is expected to bring continued light to moderate rains and thundershowers until May 14.\nA yellow alert has been issued for the state until May 11, followed by an orange alert on May 12, indicating a likelihood of intensified rains accompanied by lightning and gusty winds of around 40-50 kmph in many districts. Over the next 48 hours, the city is expected to experience light to moderate rains or thundershowers, with maximum and minimum temperatures of 38 degrees elsius and 24 degrees Celsius respectively, and relative humidity of 62 pc.",

    "title": "El millonario negocio de los créditos de carbono crece y así lo puede aprovechar LatAm",
    "text": "Bloomberg Línea — América Latina sigue siendo vista como una región amigable para las empresas de todo el mundo. La matriz energética basada principalmente en energías renovables y la Amazonía despiertan el interés en las empresas multinacionales de acudir a la región para cumplir con sus compromisos de descarbonización. La concentración de gases de efecto invernadero batió récords en 2022, de acuerdo con Naciones Unidas, y los esfuerzos por limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5°C (grados centígrados) como se planteó en el Acuerdo de París, [ requieren millonarias inversiones para alcanzar las cero emisiones netas para 2050,](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2023/08/15/descarbonizacion-asi-va-el-impulso-en-las-empresas-de-america-latina/) mitigando el impacto negativo del cambio climático. Es así como la región se perfila como una de las que más puede atraer inversiones de grandes empresas, en especial de Europa y Medio Oriente, que buscan cumplir sus compromisos ESG, tomando las oportunidades que ofrece el mercado de carbono, que alcanzó los US$2.000 millones a nivel mundial para 2022, según Ecosystem Marketplace. “América Latina es la segunda fuente más grande de créditos de carbono en el mundo, generando aproximadamente el 20% de todos los créditos de carbono a nivel mundial (en 2020 y 2021). Esta participación podría aumentar con el nuevo impulso detrás de los proyectos de conservación”, dijo Bill Udell, CEO de Control Risks para las Américas, en entrevista exclusiva con Bloomberg Línea. De acuerdo con cifras de la Cepal, Latinoamérica y el Caribe emitió en 2022 un total de US$20.500 millones de bonos internacionales GSSS (verdes, sociales, de sostenibilidad y vinculados a la sostenibilidad), destacando también los bonos de carbono, a través de documentos que certifican la disminución de emisiones de CO2 y que se negocian en los mercados de carbono globales. Las cifras y el potencial del mercado de carbono para LatAm De acuerdo con Udell, el interés en bonos verdes y financiamiento climático en la región ha aumentado en los últimos años, y aunque es un “desafío” definir cifras precisas para los totales de inversión debido a las diferentes formas de clasificar los diversos vehículos, las tendencias son claras: “La emisión de bonos verdes en América Latina ha aumentado drásticamente tanto en cantidad como en valor, tanto para empresas privadas como para instituciones públicas”. Chile y Brasil son los países que más han liderado el camino en la emisión de bonos verdes con alrededor de US$14.000 millones y US$12.000 millones, respectivamente, con corte a 2022, dijo Udell. En la lista también están Colombia, Perú, Argentina y México, que han emitido más de US$1.000 millones en bonos verdes, de acuerdo con Climate Bonds Initiative, una ONG con sede en el Reino Unido que rastrea la financiación verde. En marzo de 2020, la central hidroeléctrica La Mina de Colbún hizo su primera emisión de 50.613 toneladas en bonos de carbono, en medio de un programa del Banco Mundial y el Ministerio de Energía, para desarrollar este mercado de compensación de emisiones en el país. El ingreso fue calculado en US$150.000, en caso de ser colocados a un precio entre US$2 y US$3 por tonelada. Bajo la mirada de Udell, son los sectores extractivos (minería, petróleo y gas) los particularmente interesados en el mercado de carbono en América Latina. También precisó que aunque se han visto compañías en todos los sectores, aquellas con grandes impuestos de carbono son las que están más interesadas. Como ejemplo de esto, en septiembre de 2023, la brasileña Petrobras S.A. ( [PETR4](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/quote/PETR4:BS/)) hizo su debut en el mercado de carbono y adquirió créditos equivalentes a 175.000 toneladas de emisiones evitadas, una transacción que alcanzó los US$120 millones, según comunicó la empresa. La compra correspondió a 570 hectáreas bosque preservado. Así mismo, el año pasado, el gobierno de Río de Janeiro, en Brasil, puso en marcha un programa de incentivos fiscales destinado a atraer a la ciudad empresas involucradas en el mercado de créditos de carbono. La iniciativa ofrece devoluciones de impuestos de hasta US$12,3 millones al año a las empresas que compensen sus emisiones mediante la utilización de créditos de carbono, registró MarketNtel. En nuestras oficinas de Control Risks en Bogotá, Ciudad de México y Sao Paulo, hemos visto un aumento del interés por parte de las empresas que buscan comprender mejor el entorno de inversión para los créditos de carbono y las soluciones basadas en la naturalezaBill Udell, CEO de Control Risks para las Américas El Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina y el Caribe (CAF) señala que diferentes investigaciones han descubierto que las empresas que participan en el mercado voluntario de carbono están reduciendo sus propias emisiones más rápidamente que otras empresas que no lo hacen. Las estimaciones globales indican que la demanda de créditos voluntarios de carbono podría aumentar, al menos, 15 veces para 2030 y 100 veces para 2025. En general, ese mercado de créditos de carbono podría llegar a valer más de US$50.000 millones en 2023, dijo el banco de desarrollo en un informe. “Dado el auge que han tenido durante los últimos años y al ser tan apetecidos por los inversores, las empresas están apostando a emitir este tipo de bonos, lo que ha generado que el mercado de deuda esté en crecimiento. De esta forma, la sostenibilidad económica se fortalece por medio de la realización de proyectos de inversión que favorecen a la sociedad y al medio ambiente, generando un círculo virtuoso de desarrollo e inversión”, dijo Credicorp Capital a Bloomberg Línea, sobre la relevancia de los bonos temáticos en la región. Los problemas para que LatAm desarrolle su mercado de carbono Con el poder de la Amazonía, que ocupa 7,4 millones de kilómetros cuadrados y cubre a ocho países, América Latina podría despegar aún más en el millonario negocio de los créditos de carbono. Se estima que [la cantidad de carbono eliminado de la atmósfera cada año](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2023/10/24/cambio-climatico-que-sectores-son-mas-contaminantes-y-como-actuan-empresas-en-latam/) en los bosques amazónicos gestionados por comunidades indígenas es aproximadamente equivalente a las emisiones anuales totales del Reino Unido, indicó Udell Sin embargo, el CEO de Control Risks para las Américas señaló que la Amazonía ha enfrentado graves amenazas debido a la expansión de la agricultura, así como a la tala ilegal, la minería y otras actividades ilícitas (incluido el tráfico de drogas) en los últimos años. Udell insistió en que existen riesgos para las empresas que financian estos proyectos y compran créditos. Estos incluyen preocupaciones de seguridad (debido a la creciente presencia de organizaciones criminales y economías ilícitas en la Amazonía), así como “problemas de acceso a la tierra, debido a la prevalencia de apropiaciones de tierras, desplazamientos violentos y títulos de tierras disputados en toda la región amazónica; y la falta de regulaciones claras y capacidad institucional para respaldar los mercados de carbono. Estos problemas pueden convertir las inversiones verdes de las empresas [en minas terrestres reputacionales si no se gestionan de manera efectiva](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2023/11/25/la-cop28-tiene-la-clave-del-mercado-mundial-del-carbono/)”. Para 2021, los estudios mostraban que la Amazonía era un emisor neto de carbono debido a un rápido aumento de la deforestación, finalizó Udell, señalando que bajo los gobiernos actuales, especialmente de Brasil y Colombia, la conservación forestal ha vuelto a ser una prioridad. ¿Cómo funciona este mercado? El profesor de la Universidad de los Andes y ex ministro de Medio Ambiente de Colombia, Manuel Rodríguez Becerra, explicó los tres principales actores que están involucrados en los créditos de carbono: el propietario de los bosques que evita la deforestación y es dueño de los créditos de carbono; el promotor de los créditos e intermediario para venderlos; y el comprador, que es la empresa que genera las emisiones y busca disminuir su huella comprando estos créditos. Para llevarlo a lo práctico, acudió a las empresas aéreas, que pueden reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero comprando créditos de carbono que vendan los propietarios de los bosques que no se deforestan. Estos créditos, por lo general, son una reducción verificada de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero equivalentes a una tonelada métrica de dióxido de carbono (CO₂). Es decir, representan la cantidad de gases que se han evitado si no se tala determinado porcentaje de bosque, indicó a la institución educativa.",
