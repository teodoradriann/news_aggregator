    "text": "THE Muslim Lawyers’ Association of Nigeria (MULAN), Oyo State branch, has called on Nigerians to trust in God in this period of economic hardship and beyond.\nThe state chairman of MULAN, Alhaji Ismail Akorede, made the call in Ibadan at the 2024 Ramadan lecture of thhe association titled ‘Navigating through Economic Challenges: Legal, Political, Medical and Islamic Perspectives’.\nAkorede said no one could ease the difficulty that Nigerians are passing through except Allah and that is the reason why it is imperatives to trust in Him.\n“I call on Nigerians to put their trust in God in these trying times. Only He can ease our affairs,” he said.\nAccording to Akorede, contributing to the entrenchment of justice and promotion of Islamic ideals is one of the core goals of MULAN.\nThe chairman said the association had embarked on several programmes in line with its core objectives.\nHe thanked MULAN members for their support and appealed for increased commitment so that the association could achieve its goals.\nHe congratulated members of the association who got elevated to various offices of honour and responsibilities and prayed for God’s guidance for them to discharge their duties creditably.\nHe appealed to the state governor, Seyi Makinde, to speed up the process of appointing additional judges in the state’s High Courts to aid quick dispensation of justice..\nThe special guest of honour, the state deputy governor, Chief Bayo Lawal, called on the Federal Government to consider paying derivation fund to states where solid minerals are extracted, just as it does with oil-bearing states.\nLawal argued that payment of such derivation fund would help the solid minerals-bearing states to provide more social infrastructure and facilitate rapid development of the states.\nHe noted that solid minerals could be found in almost all states of the federation and it would not be a bad idea for the states to benefit from their natural endowments.\nIn his submission, the chairman of the occasion, Senator Fatai Buhari, said Nigeria needed good leaders and followers, noting that virtually every Nigerian had contributed to the country’s problems.\nHe stressed the need for the re-orientation of the populace and the meting of punitive measures to corrupt individuals so that people would do the right things for the development of the country.\nThe guest lecturer, Alhaji Muhammud Adesina, SAN, said that adherence to the rule of law is important for the economic prosperity of the citizenry.\nHe noted that adherence to the rule of law would attract local and foreign investments and consequently reduce the economic challenges confronting the nation.\n“It is important to consider various perspectives of legal, political and Islamic views to navigate through current challenges in Nigeria and exercise patience with the fear of God,’’ Adesina said.\nAlso speaking, a consultant neurological Surgeon, Dr Liadi Tiamiyu, said Nigerians needed to retreat from the errors of the past and put humanity at the forefront of their financial pursuits.\nTiamiyu, also a guest speaker at the event, noted that wealthy Nigerians would be safe only when they imbibe the spirit of caring and sharing.\nHe stressed that there would be no peace for the rich if surrounded by the poor.\nAmong dignitaries present at the event were the Okere of Saki, Oba Khalid Oyedepo; Justice M.A. Adegbola, Alhaji Olasunkanmi Sanusi, SAN, and President of the Customary Court of Appeal, Justice Tajudeen AbdulGaniyu.\nRead Also: DSS allows doctor examine Nnamdi Kanu",

    "text": "Many reports and rumours predicted that Google had scrapped its tablet category and suggested that the company may have already dropped the idea of a future tablet release. Google had initially planned to release the Pixel Tablet 2 in 2025, and a third-generation variant was in its early stages of development with a scheduled release for 2027. However, a new report suggests the tech giant might have scrapped plans for the long-awaited Pixel Tablet 2, not the Pixel Tablet 3 for now. Google Pixel Tablet 3 could be in the works According to a new report by Android Authority, citing unknown sources, credible Android expert Mishaal Rahman found out that 'Kiyomi,' the codename for the canceled Pixel Tablet, actually refers to the Pixel Tablet 2 and not the Pixel Tablet 3. Therefore, the Pixel Tablet 3, which is planned to be released in 2026 or 2027 after the Pixel 11 series launch, still very well be a possibility. Moreover, the purported Pixel Tablet 3 model is reported to be powered by the upcoming Tensor G6 processor, with lower clock speeds. Rahman has speculated that Google wasn't convinced about the direction heading with the Pixel Tablet 2 and the project eventually has been scrapped. However, with the Pixel Tablet 3, Google could provide further advanced specs and features that align more closely with its long-term tablet strategy. It is also expected to come with a DisplayPort output with the USB 3.2 standard, making it easy for users to transport the on-screen content to a bigger display.\",",

    "text": "A Conservative MP has been criticised for suggesting most children who struggle in an English town are the “products of crap parents”. James Daly was accused by his Labour rival of “insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury” after the remark was made in a newspaper piece analysing election prospects for the Greater Manchester town. Mr Daly, speaking to the i newspaper, stressed the importance of “stability” offered by the family unit as he outlined what the New Conservatives group of MPs stands for. The Bury North MP said: “I think New Conservatives represent very much working-class conservatism. “We’re not a strange right-wing sect. It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life. “When you think about the family, it’s about stability. “Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue? “On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.” James Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents. “Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home. “Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
