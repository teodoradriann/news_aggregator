    "text": "Maybe a Message from Above Can Offer Hope LOS ANGELES, CA - December 28, 2023 - “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest.\nAnd most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.\nWhere to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God.\nDr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org\nMost of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct Quote: s from the Real Reality, and this is one such Quote: pertaining to war:\n\"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals …\nAll the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?”\nAnd this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer:\n“Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\"\nThe question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace.\nDr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org).\nAn example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website:\n\"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\"\n Ascot Media Group, Inc.\nContact Person: Gloria Gonzalez\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 281.333.3507\nAddress: Post Office Box 2394\nCity: Friendswood\nState: TX 77549\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.ascotmedia.com/",

The vehicle collided with motorcyclist Jeffrey Nissen at around 3.45 pm on Friday in Maltby - a suburban area about 15 miles outside of Seattle. The 56-year-old Tesla driver told emergency services that the vehicle in autopilot mode \"lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him.\" Court documents also stated that the driver admitted to having one drink before the crash, but passed field and blood tests. A Tesla driver has been charged with vehicular homicide after his car in autopilot mode killed a motorcyclist, documents showGetty The driver of a 2022 Tesla Model S told a Washington State Patrol trooper that he had looked at his phone while the Tesla was moving, Fox News reports. The trooper wrote in a probable-cause document: \"The next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him.\" According to the document, the driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide \"based on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him.\" Authorities said they have not yet verified whether Autopilot was in use at the time of the incident. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Washington State Patrol Capt. Deion Glover said: \"We have not gotten that far yet. It’s very early stages of the investigation.\" Nissen, 28, died at the scene after he was ejected from the bike before being run over by the Tesla. His death comes four months after US auto safety regulators pressured Tesla into recalling more than 2 million vehicles to fix a defective system which is supposed to ensure drivers pay attention while using Autopilot. Tesla states on its website that Autopilot is intended \"for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.\" The driver of a 2022 Tesla Model S told a Washington State Patrol trooper that he had looked at his phone while the Tesla was moving, Fox News reports (stock image) Getty It is unknown whether the Tesla involved in the Washington collision had the software update specified in the recall. Speaking about Nissen's death, his sister Jenessa Fagerlie said: \"[Jeff] was such a loving person, such a loving uncle. He loved his nieces and nephews. \"We were hoping someday that he would have kids, but he got taken too soon,\" she told FOX 13.",

    "text": "Laura Ramírez/Fermín Cabanillas | Huelva/Sevilla (EFE).- La previsión de lluvias intensas en la zona occidental de Andalucía en la tarde del 5 y 6 de enero ha llevado a numerosas localidades de Huelva y Sevilla a adelantar a la tarde del 4 de enero sus cabalgatas de Reyes Magos . Se trata de evitar que los cortejos sufran las inclemencias del tiempo o tengan que suspenderse.\nEs una situación que ya se vivió en la provincia sevillana en 2018. Entonces, la mayoría de sus cortejos se pasaron a la tarde del día 4, mientras que se mantuvo la de la capital. En este caso fue un recorrido que se vio alterado por la lluvia en muchos tramos.\nHasta las 12:00 horas de este jueves habían anunciado el adelanto al 4 de enero las localidades sevillanas de Alcalá de Guadaíra, Huévar del Aljarafe, Carmona, Aznalcóllar, Bormujos, Arahal, La Puebla del Río, Morón, Marchena y Coria del Río. La previsión de lluvia de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) para el domingo 5 de enero alcanza una probabilidad del 100 %. Se pronostica en varios momentos del día.\nSevilla mantiene las previsiones Otros ayuntamientos tomarán la decisión durante la jornada de hoy. Sevilla capital, con la segunda cabalgata más antigua de España, no tiene por ahora intención de cambiar los planes.\nEn la capital andaluza la cabalgata la organiza el Ateneo . Fuentes de esta entidad han indicado que los planes iniciales siguen, por el momento, adelante. Son la visita del Heraldo el día 4 y la cabalgata el 5.\nEn municipios como Gerena nada cambia. Su cabalgata es en la mañana del 6 de enero. Se plantean qué hacer en el barrio sevillano de Triana. Allí el recorrido es el mismo día 6, pero por la tarde, cuando se espera igualmente lluvia.\nLos cambios en Huelva En Huelva, ante la previsión de lluvias y vientos que podrían ser intensos el domingo en la provincia, son ya alrededor de una decena los ayuntamientos que han decidido adelantar al día 4 sus cabalgatas de Reyes, entre ellos el de la capital.\nDe esta forma, el Ayuntamiento ha informado de que ha cambiado toda la programación relativa a la visita de los Reyes Magos.\nPara empezar, se adelanta en una hora el horario previsto para su llegada en barco, estando prevista su bienvenida el 4 de enero a las 10.30 horas en la Marina del Odiel, con la intención de celebrar esa misma tarde la Gran Cabalgata y dejar para el día siguiente, domingo 5 de enero, las visitas a hospitales y asilos en la jornada matinal y posteriormente, a partir de las 17:00 horas, la recogida oficial de cartas en el Salón de Plenos Consistorial.\nMomento de la cabalgata de los Reyes Magos en Higuera de la Sierra (Huelva), considerada como una de las más antiguas de Andalucía, el año pasado. EFE/Miguel Vázquez/ARCHIVO La decisión del adelanto la han tomado también municipios de la comarca como Punta Umbría, Condado La Palma del Condado, Bollullos del Condado, Bonares, Almonte – que adelanta las de Almonte y El Rocío aunque no la de Matalascañas que estará pendiente de la evolución del tiempo-, Niebla o Hinojos.\nA ellos se suman en otras comarcas las localidades de Beas, Gibraleón o la Entidad Local Autónoma de Tharsis, dependiente de Alosno.\nOtros municipios como los costeros de Ayamonte, Lepe o Cartaya tomarán su decisión a lo largo del día de hoy.\nModificación de actos paralelo.\nActos paralelos El cambio en la salida de las cabalgatas provoca también modificaciones en los actos paralelos de los Reyes Magos, como en Arahal (Sevilla), donde es costumbre visitar a enfermos, asociaciones y la Residencia de Mayores Madre Encarnación, previstas por la mañana del 5 de enero, que ahora se modifica para adaptar la agenda al nuevo recorrido.\nDe momento, en los almacenes municipales siguen los trabajos para ultimar las carrozas y los cortejos preparan todo para salir, pendientes de las últimas órdenes de los organizadores para que todo salga conforme a lo previsto, aunque haya que cambiar el día de salida oficial.",

    "text": "Ieri il patriarca caldeo, card. Louis Raphael Sako ha celebrato la Messa in Coena Domini nel piccolo villaggio di Hazar Jot nell’Arcidiocesi di Mosul, nella chiesa di Santa Maria. Durante la liturgia ha lavato i piedi a 12 fedeli. Lo riferisce il patriarcato caldeo. “Lavare i piedi significa lavare e purificare i cuori – ha detto Mar Sako -. Gesù lavò i piedi ai suoi discepoli perché lavassero i loro cuori”. Nonostante ciò “il cuore di Giuda non venne lavato e per una manciata di soldi l’apostolo lo tradì, anteponendo il suo interesse alla fedeltà al Maestro. Anche oggi ci sono parabole di Giuda Iscariota dappertutto. L’importante è che manteniate la purezza dei vostri cuori affinché Cristo possa abitare in voi”. “Gesù – ha aggiunto Mar Sako – ha offerto suo corpo perché noi potessimo essere in Lui, per trasformarci lentamente nel suo corpo. Oggi però ci sono in mezzo a persone veramente sante e osservanti, tanti ipocriti che pregano e prendono il sacramento, ma fanno esattamente il contrario di ciò che Gesù predicava”.",

    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo forfait, Lionel Messi remplaçant: Aymeric Laporte, auteur d'un lob de 60 m, a été la vedette du match amical entre Al-Nassr et l'Inter Miami, remporté haut la main 6-0 par le club saoudien, jeudi à Ryad. Le duel très attendu entre Ronaldo et Messi, 13 Ballons d'Or à eux deux, n'a pas eu lieu. Le Portugais, blessé à un mollet, n'a pu croiser son éternel rival argentin lors de la Ryad Season Cup, un tournoi amical disputé en Arabie saoudite (29 janvier- 8 février). Sur le banc au coup d'envoi, Messi n'est entré en jeu qu'à la 83e minute. Trop tard pour permettre à l'Inter Miami de remonter au score. Malgré la présence de ses anciens coéquipiers du FC Barcelone Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba et Sergio Busquets, son équipe avait déjà pris l'eau, menée 6-0 avec notamment un but exceptionnel d'Aymeric Laporte. Sur un coup franc frappé depuis sa moitié de terrain, le Franco-Espagnol a lobé le gardien de l'Inter Miami, Drake Callender, trop avancé (12e). Otavio, buteur dès la 3e minute, Talisca, auteur d'un triplé (10e, 51e sp, 73e) et Maran (68e) ont inscrit les autres buts d'Al-Nassr.",

    "text": "Slick Travel Conditions Expected Thursday Morning By Karri Triplett Published: Dec. 12, 2024 at 5:43 PM EST | Updated: 21 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nPRESQUE ISLE, Maine (WAGM) - Wednesday night’s rain is expected to affect travel in the county Thursday morning. The potential for this much rain in a short period of time has the county on an aerial flood watch that is in effect until tomorrow morning. The County is getting a December rainstorm. The amount of rainfall expected combined with snow melt and high winds has the potential for vehicles to hydroplane as well as the possibility of local power outages. The Aroostook Emergency Management Agency has had several meetings with local organizations preparing for the storm.\nDarren Woods, Director of the Aroostook Emergency Management Agency said, “With the winds that are being projected right after the soaking rain we are anticipating some power outages. We always hope that there aren’t any, but you can’t live on hope. You have to be prepared. So, we tell people to prepare for power outages like you would any other and watch for pooling water in the roadways where there may be clogged storm drains and whatnot.”\nMeteorologist Vanessa Symonick said the main concern for local travel is the potential for ponding onto the roadways and refreezing to occur. This could make for some slick travel conditions Thursday morning. “So, when we’re thinking about road conditions, and we’re thinking about the different types of precipitation, when we think about freezing rain like we dealt with earlier this morning you want to think of it as that glaze, that icy glaze. I kind of put things into perspective in the way of donuts if we’re comparing things. So, if you have that icy glaze think of it as your glazed donut, really coating everything in terms of the pavement. We’re thinking about rain, that main concern is for hydroplaning because of the ponding onto the roadways. So, even though there isn’t that slick component to it, it still is hazardous enough to create some difficult travel conditions even with warmer temperatures.” Locals can check for the latest updates on road conditions and weather alerts at wagmtv.com.\nCopyright 2024 WAGM.
