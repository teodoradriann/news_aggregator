    "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio. AFP FILE PHOTO\nOscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio has added his voice to a growing number of prominent personalities who have urged the government to protect Masungi Geopark Project, a critical conservation area in Rizal province.\n“Masungi is a lush montane rainforest landscape outside of Manila, the bustling capital of the Philippines,” DiCaprio said in an Instagram post on Thursday. “In the late 1990s, much of Masungi was illegally deforested. Local communities fostered the development of the @masungigeoreserve, spurring efforts to restore this precious ecosystem,” he added.\nADVERTISEMENT “Now this success is in jeopardy, as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) threatens to cancel the agreement that protects this area from prolific land-grabbing activities. This cancellation would set back the success of an internationally acclaimed conservation effort and leave the area vulnerable again to mining, logging, and illegal developments,” DiCaprio said.\nFEATURED STORIES GLOBALNATION Army spox: US missile system to be removed from PH by Sept GLOBALNATION US missile system spotted in Ilocos Norte GLOBALNATION NBI: ‘Third Alice Guo’ a different person from Bamban Mayor Alice Guo He called on President Marcos to “intervene and continue to protect Masungi,” saying the protected area would serve to remind people the Philippines could become a “leader in sustainability, ecotourism, biodiversity protection, and climate action.”\nDiCaprio, the star of hit movies such as “Titanic,” “The Revenant,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Inception,” is an environmental advocate who formed the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation which supports conservation projects worldwide. For this, he was designated a United Nations Messenger of Peace for Climate Change in 2014.\nNoncompliant The DENR responded to DiCaprio’s post by saying that it welcomed “statements of concern for the Philippine environment from international celebrities who are distinguished in their respective fields. However, no one is exempt from the law.”\n“The Filipino people own the area occupied by Masungi Georeserve Foundation and the operation of the resort venues that charge the public for day tours, meetings, and weddings remains non-compliant with Philippine laws,” it said in a statement also on Thursday.\nREAD: DENR thanks Leo DiCaprio but says law must prevail on Masungi\n“As the DENR continues to take steps toward strengthening its compliance and enforcement capacities, we value all those parties who have submitted themselves to the required processes and procedures as defined by existing laws,” it added.\nADVERTISEMENT Under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) signed with the government in 2017, the Masungi Georeserve Foundation was tasked to lead the protected area’s conservation. Environment Secretary Ma. Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga, however, announced that they were planning to cancel the MOA, a move that environmental advocates fear would destroy the georeserve by opening it to business development.\nAmong those who have expressed support for Masungi are English conservationist Jane Goodall, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, and British musician and activist Sting. Local personalities such as pop group SB19, actresses Yassi Pressman, Nadine Lustre, and Glaiza de Castro have also lent their voices, along with politicians like Sen. Nancy Binay, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, and Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto.\nGreen corridor Billie Dumaliang, a trustee of the Masungi foundation, told the Inquirer in April that the protected area was one of the last remaining green corridors between Manila and the Sierra Madre mountain range.\n“If it falls to urbanization and intensive land use, it will [have] a domino effect on the surrounding protected areas,” she said.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "TOPSFIELD — Two people were seriously injured in a highway car crash that occurred Christmas Day on I-95 in Topsfield. Topsfield Fire/EMS were dispatched to I-95 southbound just after 6 p.m. on Monday, after the North Shore Regional 911 Center received several reports of a serious motor vehicle crash with at least one individual ejected from a car, according to a press release from the Topsfield Fire Department. The crash seriously injured one individual who was in the median when emergency services arrived, and potentially seriously injured another. While no other drivers were injured, several other vehicles received damage as a result of the crash. While directing incoming units, Lt. John Boyle, as well as Firefighter/EMT Matt Enos, treated the more seriously injured individual and prepared them for transport, as they realized time was of the essence, the press release said. Both patients were transported to local hospitals. Their condition is unknown at this time. Due to it being a holiday and the initial response being a solo unit, one engine was requested from the Boxford Fire Department, and a mutual aid ambulance was requested from Northeast Regional Ambulance, authorities said. Off-duty Topsfield firefighters at home finishing holiday festivities also responded with another engine to assist at the scene. MedFlight was notified but was unable to respond to the scene due to low ceiling height from cloud/fog cover. “As always we are grateful for our members and mutual aid partners’ work at these serious incidents and continue to keep the affected parties in our thoughts hoping for a positive outcome,” fire Chief Jen Collins-Brown said in a press release. The crash remains under investigation by Massachusetts State Police.",

    "text": "New screening gives pregnant women a less invasive route for prenatal genetic testing.\nGenetic testing during pregnancy has improved dramatically in recent years. As the screening options have expanded, so have the specialized services available. Today, a simple blood test can screen for common chromosomal conditions, and a genetic counselor with specialized training will be with you to guide you through the process. You will have individualized guidance as you navigate what to screen for, what tests to select and how to interpret your results.\n“We now have more expansive and accurate genetic screening than ever before,” said Brighton Goodhue, a certified genetic counselor and member of the\nhigh-risk pregnancy team at Vanderbilt Women’s Health. “That said, genetic testing is entirely optional. You can opt for certain genetic screens before becoming pregnant. For our pregnant patients, we offer screening to everyone — as early as nine to 10 weeks — and explain the options available. If you choose any type of prenatal genetic screening or testing, we’ll be with you every step of the way.”\nNon-invasive prenatal testing\nNon-invasive prenatal screening is a blood test for those who are already pregnant that can screen for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and other common genetic conditions. This screening test can provide information when a pregnant patient does not want to have a more invasive procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, both of which carry a slight risk of miscarriage.\n“This test is also known as cell-free DNA screening,”\nGoodhue said. “It works by analyzing small fragments of genetic information from the placenta that can be detected in the maternal bloodstream during pregnancy.”\nNon-invasive prenatal screening cannot definitively confirm or rule out a chromosome abnormality. However, results reported as “low risk” indicate a 99% chance that a pregnancy is not affected with common chromosomal disorders such as trisomy 21, trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, as well as a number of sex chromosome abnormalities such as Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome.\nAmniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling\nIf a non-invasive prenatal screening result is reported as “high risk,” the patient will be offered a diagnostic test either during the pregnancy or after the birth of the baby to confirm the results.\n“During the pregnancy, an\namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can determine the accuracy of the high-risk results,” Goodhue said. “These tests are more comprehensive than the non-invasive prenatal screen and can allow for the diagnosis of a chromosome condition, in addition to other genetic abnormalities including microdeletions, microduplications and single-gene disorders.”\nDiagnostic testing via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is always available, regardless of results from non-invasive prenatal screening.\nAdditional options for genetic testing, including before pregnancy\nNon-invasive prenatal screening does not screen for all genetic conditions or birth defects, so patients with concerns about a specific family history or those who desire more genetic information about a pregnancy can schedule to meet with a reproductive genetic counselor at any point in their family-planning process.\n“Vanderbilt has reproductive genetic counselors who are available to counsel you about your reproductive risks and go over individualized options for genetic testing — whether before pregnancy or during pregnancy,” Goodhue said.\nExpert care for you and your baby\nEach pregnancy and delivery is unique and yours should be too. Learn more about how Vanderbilt Health’s obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine teams bring together nationally ranked expertise and personalized care from your first prenatal visit to delivery and beyond.\nTo learn more, call 615-343-5700 or\nschedule an appointment online.",

EFE/ Henry Chirinos The president of Venezuela , Nicolas Maduro declared two female Chavista militants “martyrs” on Monday, “murdered” after the elections of July 28, of which the president accused – without showing evidence – the leaders of the majority opposition, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia y Maria Corina Machado .\n“I ask for the most sublime tributes for them as martyrs of this anti-fascist revolution” said the head of state in a meeting with the ruler United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) broadcast by the state channel VTV.\nMaduro claimed that both women were murdered “by the commandos” – political organization groups of the campaign of the largest opposition coalition, the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) – of «Fascist Maria Machado and the cowardly criminal Edmundo Gonzalez» and noted that “all the intellectual and material authors have been captured.”\nThe Chavista leader, who was declared the winner of the presidential election based on results that are still unknown in detail, said that these were crimes of “fascism” by both opponents, for whom he recently requested jail time for alleged “criminal” actions after the elections, in which the PUD claims that its candidate won.\nMaduro, who reiterated that two soldiers were also killed, assured that the Bolivarian National Guard ( GNB militarized police), the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) and some regional security forces “saved hundreds of citizens” from the claws of the fascists.\nCARACAS (VENEZUELA), 08/17/2024.- Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado (right) waves the Venezuelan flag in front of supporters this Saturday, in Caracas (Venezuela). Machado reappeared in public to participate in the rally against the official result of the presidential elections that – she claims – was won by the standard-bearer of the largest opposition coalition, Edmundo González Urrutia, despite the fact that the National Electoral Council (CNE) awarded the victory to Nicolás Maduro. EFE/ Miguel Gutiérrez According to official figures, more than 2,400 people were arrested during the post-election protests – some of which resulted in violence – and 25 deaths, which the Prosecutor’s Office attributes to “criminal groups instrumentalized” by the “comanditos.”\nThe majority of anti-Chavez supporters have called for the release of those arrested for protesting against the official election results and for “the persecution to cease.”\nLast week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk denounced “the high and continuous number of arbitrary arrests” and the “disproportionate use” of force reported after the protests, an assertion that the Government rejected.

Picture: Glyn KIRK / AFP\nHat-trick hero Cole Palmer scored twice deep into stoppage time on Thursday as Chelsea stunned Manchester United 4-3, all but ending United’s hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League.\nErik ten Hag’s men appeared set for a famous victory after storming back from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 in a staggering game containing a combined 47 shots.\nBut Palmer had the last word, levelling from the penalty spot in the 100th minute and then netting the winner moments later.\nDefeat for United leaves them 11 points off fourth-placed Aston Villa with just eight games to play and facing a season outside Europe’s elite club competition.\nBut it lifts Mauricio Pochettino’s men to 10th spot in the table, keeping them in the hunt for European places.\nChelsea came into the match without a win against Manchester United in 12 Premier League meetings but were ahead in just the fourth minute through captain Conor Gallagher.\nPalmer doubled the home side’s lead with his first penalty in the 19th minute in a torrid opening for Ten Hag’s inconsistent team.\nBut two goals in a five-minute spell later in the first half by Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes pulled the visitors level as the contest caught light.\nPlay swung wildly from end to end in a thrilling second period but Garnacho headed home a pinpoint cross from Antony to put United ahead in the 67th minute.\nEight minutes added The visitors appeared set for a morale-boosting win but the officials signalled there would be eight minutes of added time.\nChelsea were given a lifeline when Diogo Dalot lunged at Noni Madueke and referee Jarred Gillett’s on-field decision to award a spot kick was confirmed after a lengthy VAR check.\nBut the drama did not stop there.\nUnited were caught out by a quick corner from Enzo Fernandes, who played it short to Palmer.\nThe Chelsea man fired home past the despairing Onana with the help of a deflection to seal the three points, sending the Stamford Bridge crowd wild.\nRead more on these topics Chelsea F.C.
