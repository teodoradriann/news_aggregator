    "text": "By Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis\nAYODHYA, India (Reuters) – Less than a month before a grand Hindu temple opens, India’s northern town of Ayodhya is buzzing with activity as finishing touches are put on a project seen as the centrepiece of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election campaign.\nOnce a sleepy temple town in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya has received a new airport and roads in a $6-billion facelift as Modi prepares to inaugurate the temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities.\nA day before Modi was set to inaugurate the airport and a renovated train station, workers decorated the streets with flowers, amid a swarm of police.\n“Soon our Lord will be in his original place,” said Girish Sahastrabhojane, who worked on the design of the temple, which forms part of a sprawling 70-acre (28-hectare) complex of carved pink sandstone and white marble.\n“Our Lord Ram was born here and the Hindus of India, and also abroad, have been waiting for it since 1992,” the engineer involved in the construction told visiting reporters.\nBut Modi’s opponents have accused him of stoking religious sentiment to further his political ambitions, and several opposition leaders have declined an invitation to attend the temple’s inauguration.\nOn Jan. 22, Modi will pray for the first time before an idol of Lord Ram at the project, which cost more than 20 billion rupees ($240 million), and where more than 4,500 workers are labouring round the clock to complete the ground floor.\nWearing hardhats and safety shoes, they worked on Friday to carve pillars and lift stones amid cranes towering over the site, which Sahastrabhojane said could accommodate 125,000 people in a day.\nModi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims.\nHe has made its construction an emotive issue in many speeches ahead of next year’s general elections, widely expected to secure him a third term.\nNationwide riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them minority Muslims, broke out in 1992 after a Hindu mob razed the Babri mosque – where the temple will stand – saying it was built on the site of an earlier Hindu temple.\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court ordered that Hindus be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.\n($1=83.1875 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis in Ayodhya; Writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "text": "Trips to the seaside may be reserved for the summer months but there’s a North Yorkshire seaside town that could buck this trend.\nThere’s something rather lovely about a blustery day by the coast but when you combine that with the fact this seaside town is actually warmer than any other part in Yorkshire, it makes it a no brainer.\nSandsend in North Yorkshire is said to have its own microclimate. This means it is warmer than any other part of Yorkshire – something that could be contributing to the town’s reputation as one of the most popular places to visit on the Yorkshire Coast .\nWith its stunning stretch of beach and breathtaking views over the Cleveland Way, thousands of tourists flock to the village every single summer. Such is its popularity, house prices in the area to surge to around £1,000,000.\nThe coastal village of Sandsend, North Yorkshire\nThe small village is about three miles from Whitby and you can see the famous Abbey and harbour in the distance while on the beach. Its in close proximity to the stunning North York Moors and opportunities to go sailing and golfing nearby also add to Sandsend’s appeal.\nBut what makes this tiny place all the more interesting and appealing to visitors is its very own microclimate – which makes Sandsend warmer than any other place in Yorkshire.\nDay-trippers from near and far flock to the beach on sunny days to enjoy the seaside towns scorching hot and sunny weather. It can often be raining in neighbouring towns such as Whitby or Scarborough but Sandsend will remain bathed in sunshine.\nThis is because coastal town has what is known as a maritime climate or oceanic climate – which essentially gives the town milder seasons, or ‘better weather’ depending on whether you prefer cold or warmth.\nIt very rarely snows, although conditions did make a treacherous drop when temperatures fell below 0C and ‘danger to life’ warnings were in place across parts of Yorkshire last month, in December.",

    "text": "MADRID, 26 Sep. (EUROPA PRESS) - El jefe de la diplomacia europea, Josep Borrell, ha afirmado este jueves que teme que Israel inicie una invasión terrestre en Líbano en el marco de la escalada de tensión en Oriente Próximo. Según Borrell, la Unión Europea lleva tiempo \"temiéndolo\" e intentando que no ocurra. \"Pero en este momento lo que hay es un altísimo peligro\", ha dicho este jueves en una entrevista en Cadena Ser, recogida por Europa Press. En cuanto a si cree que hay posibilidades reales de un alto el fuego en Líbano, Borrell ha admitido que quiere creerlo, pero \"cada día es más difícil seguir creyéndolo\". Preguntado por si el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, se ha convertido en un peligro para el mundo, el Alto Representante ha advertido que \"desde luego\" la guerra en Líbano sería una \"amenaza terrible\" para la seguridad y para la paz en la región \"y eso, es quizá el objetivo, arrastraría a Irán\", ha augurado. El Ejército israelí ha llevado a cabo este jueves una nueva oleada de bombardeos contra objetivos del partido-milicia chií libanés Hezbolá en el sur de Líbano en el marco de la campaña intensificada de ataques aéreos contra el país desde el lunes.",

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad/) Detienen a un hombre en Elche por robar un crucifijo, una cruz, una esfera y medallas con la imagen de la Virgen El arrestado, tras ser descubierto por el sacristán de la parroquia, huyó del lugar Elche La Policía Nacional de la Comisaría de Elche y el Cuerpo de la Policía Local han detenido a un hombre como presunto autor del robo con fuerza cometido en una parroquia. La intervención inicial fue llevada a cabo por una patrulla de la Policía de Elche, a requerimiento del sacristán de la parroquia donde habían sustraído diversos objetos religiosos y musicales. El religioso relató a los agentes que había visto merodear a un hombre, al cual no conocía, por delante de la sacristía y al ser interpelado por el motivo de su presencia allí, éste se marchó rápidamente del lugar, percatándose poco después de que la cerradura de la puerta de la sacristía había sido forzada. Asimismo, los agentes locales realizaron un reportaje fotográfico y un informe de lo sucedido y pudieron localizar a un hombre que portaba varios objetos religiosos de cuya procedencia no daba razones, por lo que, como medida preventiva, intervinieron los objetos. Tras recabar imágenes de lo ocurrido por las cámaras de seguridad del lugar, se pudo identificar plenamente al autor de los hechos que, igualmente, fue reconocido por parte del sacristán. Ante lo acontecido, los agentes procedieron a la detención de esta persona y recuperaron varios de los objetos sustraídos, como un crucifijo, una esfera y una cruz metálicas dorada y medallas doradas con la imagen de la virgen. El arrestado, de 50 años de edad, contaba con multitud de antecedentes por delitos similares y fue puesto a disposición del Juzgado de Instrucción de guardia de la localidad de Elche, que decretó su ingreso en prisión.",

    "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. — A boy who was found unconscious and unresponsive in a bathtub in Glendale Thursday afternoon is on the road to recovery, according to officials with the Glendale Police Department.\nVERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL: Niño encontrado inconsciente dentro de una bañera en Glendale\nOfficers responded to 911 calls at a home near 59th Avenue and Bethany Home Road around 2 p.m. and found the child unresponsive. The child was rushed to a hospital in critical condition, officials said.\nAs of Friday morning, the boy has been recovering well and is in stable condition, a detective on the case said.\nThe mother told officers she stepped away and found the child in the bathtub before calling 911.\nThis is a developing story. 12News will post updates here.\nRELATED: Phoenix Children's Hospital expert shares tips on how to keep children safe around water\nDrowning Prevention Tips Drowning is the leading cause of death for children between ages 1-4 aside from birth defects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three children die every day as a result of drowning. Here are some tips from the CDC on how to protect children around water:\nLearn life-saving skills.\nEveryone should know the basics of swimming (floating, moving through the water) and CPR.\nFence it off.\nInstall a four–sided isolation fence, with self–closing and self–latching gates, around backyard swimming pools. This can help keep children away from the area when they aren’t supposed to be swimming. Pool fences should be completely separate the house and play area from the pool.\nLife jackets are a must.\nMake sure kids wear life jackets in and around natural bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean, even if they know how to swim. Life jackets can be used in and around pools for weaker swimmers too.\nKeep a close watch\nWhen kids are in or near water (including bathtubs), closely supervise them at all times. Because drowning happens quickly and quietly, adults watching kids in or near water should avoid distracting activities like reading books, talking on the phone, or using alcohol and drugs.\nClose Ad",
