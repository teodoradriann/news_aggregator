    "text": "Running a marathon at -55°C! By David Rubio Salguero Monday, 15 January 2024 Only those who have completed a marathon know how difficult it is to run 42,195 metres, the legendary distance run by the Greek messenger Pheidippides in 480 BC to inform Athens of a key event in the Battle of Marathon. Almost 2,500 years later, the marathon is one of the most popular and admired events in athletics, but it's hard to imagine it being run in such adverse weather conditions as at the sixth edition of the 'Cold Pole - Oymyakon' last weekend in Yakutia, Republic of Sakha in Russia. Yakutia is the coldest place in the world, a region six times the size of France or Spain, but only one million people live there in such extreme conditions on permafrost, the ground that remains completely frozen over the years.A finisher in this tough race. SAKHA.GOVWith a population of just over 300,000, Yakutsk is the capital of a republic famous for having recorded the coldest temperature ever recorded in an inhabited place, at -71.2°C in Oymyakon. However, some experts believe that the real record belongs to Verkhoyansk. In these conditions, 38 Russian athletes from six different regions decided to run in Oymyakon, even though it was slightly warmer than the world record. The participants woke up very early as the race started at 6am at -55°C and competed in two different distances: 21.0975 metres (half marathon) and 42.195 metres (full marathon).The route of the \"Polar Cold-Oymyakon\" Marathon. SAKHA.GOVThe course ran between Oymyakon (462 inhabitants) and Tomtor (1,256), a rural village and administrative centre for four settlements. The athletes were accompanied by doctors throughout the race to prevent frostbite, but none of the runners required medical assistance. Amateurs from various professions took part in the marathon, even retired people came to try it out and only a few professional athletes took part in this special day in the distant Republic of Sakha. 12 men and two women finished the marathon. The winners in both the men's and women's categories received 100,000 rubles (1,038 euros). Konstantin Dragunov won in three hours and seven minutes, followed by Mikhail Aprosimov (3:36) and Albert Sivtsev (3:57).Photo taken just before start at 6am at -55ºC. SAKHA.GOVIsabella Borisova won the women's race in an astonishing three hours and 37 minutes, just one minute behind the men's runner-up. Marina Sedalishcheva was second (4h:25).Finally, there are a few questions that come to mind after reading this article and looking at the photos. Is it healthy to run 42km at -55ºC? How does the body react when it starts to get tired at these temperatures? Is it possible to sweat in these conditions? Is it harder or easier to get heart problems when it's so cold? Any other questions? Timeline",

    "text": "I find it amusing that Republicans have recently been falling over themselves to support Israel and condemn antisemitism. But this stance is purely opportunistic and entirely hypocritical.\nInnumerable Republican politicians have invoked the name of billionaire philanthropist George Soros as a proxy for the evil Jewish puppet master who secretly controls world events.\nDonald Trump insisted that some of the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville during the Unite the Right rally were \"very fine people.\"\nNumerous Republican politicians have referred to the Great Replacement Theory in their speeches and comments. This is the idea that Jews are plotting to flood the country with swarthy immigrants in order to subjugate white, Christian Americans within a secular, liberal society. These sentiments have inspired mass shooters around the world to massacre Jews, immigrants and nonwhite citizens.\nPeople are also reading…\nTerms like \"globalists\" and \"cosmopolitans\" have been bandied about by certain rightwing politicians and news commentators. These are widely understood to be antisemitic dog whistles informing us that greedy Jews are undermining the country in order to enrich themselves.\nDonald Trump, Representatives Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and several other Republican politicians have associated themselves with Holocaust denier and Jew-hater Nick Fuentes.\nMost Republican politicians have allied themselves with evangelical Christians who claim to love Israel. But evangelicals largely see Israel as a necessary player in their end times pageant, when Armageddon ensues, Jesus returns, and Jews will either convert or be cast into a lake of fire.\nMike Diamond Rock Island",

    "title": "AI Obsession Powers $7 Trillion Nasdaq 100 Rally",
    "text": "A banner year for stocks is drawing to a close, with gains in big tech leaving the market near all-time highs amid the artificial-intelligence exuberance and dovish Federal Reserve bets.\nOn the eve of Wall Street’s final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 marched toward its best year since 1999 after a $7 trillion surge. The S&P 500 approached a record — and is roughly 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833.\n“If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year — when a lot of people are adjusting their investment-game plans — it tends to exacerbate the rally.”\nIn a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets the Fed is done with its hiking campaign — and will start easing policy in 2024 — global bonds are set for their biggest two-month gain on record.\nThe S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 — extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007.\nFrom Nvidia Corp. to Microsoft Corp., the seven largest US tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq 100 is up 55% this year.\nThe ‘Magnificent Seven’ — which also includes Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building.\n“Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.”\nInvestors have flocked to big tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength.\nThose bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels — but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades.\nAlthough there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index.",
