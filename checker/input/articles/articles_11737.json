    "text": "Michigan four-star defensive back commit Brody Jennings has a special connection to Florida State.\nJennings' father, Bradley Jennings, played linebacker at FSU. For that reason, Brody has been around Tallahassee plenty throughout his life. Now as a blue-chip recruit, FSU is working hard to make him a 'Nole, something they weren't able to accomplish with his two older brothers: Bradley Jennings Jr. and Branden Jennings.\n\"I belong at Florida State. My brothers didn't come here but they're going to get one Jennings. That's what they said,\" Jennings said of FSU's message to him on today's visit.\nJennings got to take in FSU's first spring football practice. He shadowed cornerbacks coach Patrick Surtain Sr. throughout and kept a close eye on the defensive back group during the practice.\n\"Definitely how the DBs was making plays and how the DBs took the coaching from coach Norvell,\" Jennings said on what stood out at today's practice. \"He coaches really hard. They took the coaching and they let it motivate them. He yelled at one DB and the next play he caught an interception. They're just taking to coaching very well.\"\nFSU is looking at Jennings as a boundary cornerback.\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder has been committed to the Wolverines since last July but is still very much open to other schools. He has six official visits set with the following schools: Auburn, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Michigan.\nIs an official visit to Tallahasee on the table?\n\"Most likely, yessir. I haven't set one up yet,\" Jennings said of a possible OV to FSU.\nIt sounded like Jennings was going to talk with FSU's coaching staff further on the visit about setting up an official visit.\nWhen asked whether the 'Noles were in the main group of programs working to flip him or in a tier below, he was quick to call the Seminoles a contender.\n\"No, they're in the main group. Definitely, they're DBU,\" Jennings said of FSU's placement in his recruitment. \"Other schools are DBU too but Florida State, I could say the DBs off the top of my head with them. Other schools, I've probably got to think about it. Florida State is definitely DBU and people know, coach Norvell, I've had a relationship him as I've been coming to Florida State since middle school.\"\nJennings is a four-star prospect in the 247Sports Composite Rankings, slotted as the nation's No. 256 overall player and No. 22 ranked cornerback in the 2026 class.\nClick below to see ZB's Take on Jennings' recruitment",

    "text": "The much-awaited Sela Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. It will ensure all-weather connectivity to the strategically important Tawang and will help troops in swift logistical movement in the region. It will also reduce the travel distance by more than eight km and travel time by an hour.\nBuilt on a road connecting Tezpur to Tawang in the West Kameng district, the tunnel is at a height of more than 13,000 feet. It has been constructed at a cost of Rs 825 crore.\nThe Sela Tunnel was built at a cost of Rs 825 crore. (News18)\nThe foundation stone for the project was laid in 2019. It consists of two tunnels – 1,003-m and 1,595-m long — with 8.6-km approach and link roads. The second tunnel also has an escape tube adjacent to the main tunnel, as per international norms. The escape tube runs parallel to the main tube with cross passages every 500m. In case of an emergency, the escape tube can be used for movement of rescue vehicles and evacuation of stranded people.\nAs per officials, the tunnel has been designed for a traffic density of 3,000 cars and 2,000 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 km/hour.\nThe Sela tunnel has been designed for a traffic density of 3,000 cars and 2,000 trucks per day. (News18)\n“Sela Tunnel will also herald a new era of economic prosperity for the Tawang region, fostering trade, tourism, employment and overall development. Earlier, the route to Sela Pass had only single-lane connectivity and treacherous bends due to which heavy vehicles, container trucks and vehicles with trailers could not get to Tawang. Moreover, due to adverse weather conditions, specifically in winters, evacuation of patients was adversely affected along the existing Sela Pass. All this will now be feasible with opening of the tunnel,” said a senior Border Roads Organisation (BRO) official.\nThe project is one of the most important and critical projects of the BRO in the country. According to officials, the execution of this mega project took over 90 lakh man-hours with an average of around 650 personnel and labourers working every day for the past five years. Around 71,000 metric tonnes of cement, 5,000 metric tonnes of steel and 800 metric tonnes of explosive was used for construction.\nThe Sela Tunnel is one of the most important and critical projects of BRO in the country. (News18)\n“Various challenges were faced by Project Vartak during the construction of Sela Tunnel. Freezing temperatures of up to -10° C and formation of icicles inside the tunnel caused much delay in concreting process, thus affecting the completion,” said the officer.\nHe said, “Ingress of water during construction and cavity formation plus Covid also affected the progress of the work. However, now it is all set to be dedicated.”\nThe Indian Army has an adequate presence in Tawang district because of its close proximity to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China. It is also the reason why there is regular troop movement in the area. The area receives heavy to very heavy snowfall in the initial months of the year and this makes the road at Sela inaccessible at times, a problem the tunnel will solve.\nThe tunnel has state-of-the-art electro-mechanical system, including jet fan ventilation to maintain air quality, firefighting devices, CIE norms-based illumination system and SCADA-controlled monitoring systems.",

    "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants answers from pharmaceutical CEOs about why Americans are charged substantially more for some drugs than are residents of other countries. And he’s prepared to issue subpoenas to get them.\nWhat You Need To Know Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants answers from pharmaceutical CEOs about why Americans are charged substantially more for some drugs than are residents of other countries\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which Sanders chairs, will vote Wednesday on whether to subpoena Johnson & Johnson chief Joaquin Duato and Merck head Robert Davis\nSanders complained Thursday that the companies are charging too much for drugs while they are raking in large profits, paying their CEOs tens of millions of dollars each year, spending billions more on stock buybacks and flooding Washington with lobbyists\nBoth Merck and Johnson & Johnson have offered to send other executives to testify who they say have greater expertise to answer questions about the issues Sanders has raised\nThey have also suggested Sanders is targeting the CEOs because the three companies have filed lawsuits challenging the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s provision allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of some medicines The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which Sanders chairs, will vote Wednesday on whether to subpoena Johnson & Johnson chief Joaquin Duato and Merck head Robert Davis, both of whom declined requests in November to testify before the panel.\nIf authorized, they would be the first subpoenas issued by the committee since 1981.\nDuring a news conference at the Capitol on Thursday, Sanders said he wants to know why there is such a large disparity in drug prices, which is leaving many Americans unable to afford medication they’ve been prescribed. Meanwhile, he complained, top pharmaceutical companies are raking in more than $100 billion in annual profits, paying their CEOs tens of millions of dollars each year, spending billions more on stock buybacks and flooding Washington with lobbyists.\n“These are the questions that are in the minds of many elderly people in our country,” Sanders said. “Working people go to the drugstore, can't afford the prescription drugs that they desperately need.”\nThe Democratic-led committee also invited Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner to testify in November. He has agreed to appear alongside at least one of the other chief executives.\nA July poll by KFF, a nonprofit organization focused on health policy, found that 28% of people taking prescription drugs said it was difficult for them to afford their medications.\nSanders listed several examples of how Americans face higher price tags on medication. The Merck diabetes drug Januvia costs about $6,000 in the U.S., but just $200 in France, he said. Imbruvica, a Johnson & Johnson drug for blood cancer, sells for around $204,000 in the U.S., but $43,000 in Germany, Sanders said. And U.S. patients pay $6,700 for the Bristol Myers Squibb blood thinner Eliquis, while the French pay $650.\n“The pharmaceutical industry is an enormously powerful political force in America,” Sanders said. “Maybe next to Wall Street, they are the most powerful. They don't lose. The reason we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs is because they can charge us almost anytime any price they want.”\nThe Vermont senator said elevated drug prices also contribute to higher hospital bills and insurance premiums. Taxpayers, meanwhile, are on the hook for higher Medicare and Medicaid costs, he added.\nSanders said he wants Congress to pass legislation lowering drug prices but it might require building public pressure on the companies to make that happen.\nBoth Merck and Johnson & Johnson have offered to send other executives to testify who they say have greater expertise to answer questions about the issues Sanders has raised. They have also suggested Sanders is targeting the CEOs because the three companies have filed lawsuits challenging the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s provision allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of some medicines.\nIn a letter to Sanders earlier this month, Jennifer Zachary, Merck executive vice president and general counsel, cited the timing of Sanders’ request — just after news coverage about the lawsuits — and the senator’s public criticism of the litigation.\n“Retaliation may be a way to chill disfavored speech, but it is not a valid basis upon which to hold a constructive hearing,” Zachary wrote.\n“This targeting seems unlikely to be coincidental, and it raises significant concerns that the hearing is intended as retribution for the companies’ decisions to exercise their rights to challenge a statute that inappropriately infringes on constitutionally protected freedoms,” Brian Smith, an attorney representing Johnson & Johnson wrote to Sanders.\nSanders on Thursday called the allegation “absurd.”\n“These companies have every right to file a lawsuit against the administration or anyone else,” he said.\nSanders also said he finds the companies’ claims that their CEOs cannot answer questions about pricing laughable.\n“Maybe, just maybe, the CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies should become experts on why they're ripping off the American people,” the senator said.\nSmith argued in his letter that Johnson & Johnson does not have the ability to control the prices of certain drugs in every country.\nIn a statement to Spectrum News, Smith said there’s no reason for the HELP Committee to subpoena Duato because Johnson & Johnson has cooperated with the panel by offering another executive.\nIn her letter to Sanders, Merck’s Zachary wrote it is essential for the prescription drug industry to provide “access to affordable medicines without discouraging the development of innovative and lifesaving prescription drugs.”\n“As a result of research and development, the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry has been responsible for delivering important biomedical breakthroughs,” she wrote. “These include new medicines and vaccines to treat life-threating conditions and prevent disease.”\nSpeaking at Thursday’s Capitol news conference, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., chair of the HELP Committee’s Subcommittee on Primary Health & Retirement Security, said, “Innovation that costs so much that it puts hope out of reach instead of putting it into the hands of families isn't really innovation at all.”\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the top Republican on the HELP Committee, has argued that Sanders has not been willing to work with Republicans on the issue.\n“I hope the HELP Committee can return to its longstanding tradition of bipartisan cooperation, rather than focusing on how many CEOs we can drag to the stocks,” Cassidy said in a statement.\n“It’s not surprising these CEOs do not expect to be given a fair shake by this committee,” he said. “These companies offered to send their executives in charge of the policies in question, which could have led to a more insightful hearing.”\nNote: This article was updated to correct the name of KFF, which no longer uses the name Kaiser Family Foundation.
