    "title": "The Amish Are Better Than You, by Marc Dion | Creators Syndicate",
    "text": "The Amish are better than you. They're better than me, too. This is because the Amish make furniture. For the last couple years, every time I turn the television on, there's a commercial from a local retailer telling me they sell \"Amish furniture.\" \"Experience the craftsmanship of the Amish,\" the announcer's deep voice says. Then the ad shows a picture of a dining room table with six chairs. Commercials are always asking me to \"experience\" something. I'm supposed to experience fine German engineering when I drive, and I'm supposed to experience creaminess when I eat yogurt. You know who doesn't want me to experience anything? The people who sell me frozen chicken nuggets don't. What are they gonna put on the package? \"In an extremely flat part of Nebraska, a man named Julio drives to his job at a chicken processing plant. His feet are freezing because it's 10 below, and there's a big hole in the floorboard of his 13-year-old Toyota. He's on his way to his 12-hour shift. He'll be paid for eight hours because that's what his timecard is gonna show if he knows what's good for him.\" \"Uncle Homer's Homestyle Chicken Nuggets,\" the announcer's deep voice says. \"Experience the craftsmanship of exhausted illegals with faked time cards.\" You're lucky if you don't find Julio's breaded thumb in the package of nuggets. That's the difference between an \"undocumented person\" and an \"illegal.\" An undocumented person is being interviewed on television after graduating from Yale. An illegal is cutting chickens in half on the night shift for crap money. Not so with the Amish furniture. I checked. Amish furniture is better than, say, Episcopal furniture, because the Amish make their furniture in small workshops, the way everything used to be made before humans got smart and invented machines to make everything. And you? What do you make, ya lazy Methodist? You don't make anything, right? You don't have a small workshop that smells like sawdust and beard hair. You sell real estate. Your idea of \"craftsmanship\" is talking a young couple into buying a home with no closets that is located in a neighborhood zoned \"residential/gun store/ strip club.\" Amish furniture is expensive, too. This is so that, if you're a lapsed Catholic who has made a lot of money selling substandard, Chinese-made wheelchairs to the disabled at inflated Medicaid prices, you can experience the craftsmanship of people who are better than you are. That's the American way. If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. No one really knows what it's like to be Amish, and the Amish aren't interested in explaining themselves. You're going to hell. They're not. Close the book. Turn out the lights. Thank God we can experience the Amish through their furniture, otherwise we might think of them solely in terms of chin beards, buggies and big hats. And that's not fair. Everyone's got something to sell. I'm selling this column. You're selling cars. The Amish are selling furniture. If you're lucky, you have a brand behind you. \"The craftsmanship of the Amish.\" The Ford badging on the cars. That stuff. That's Julio's problem. No brand. He didn't even use his real name when he applied for the job at the chicken plant. If he ever has to get another job, he won't be Julio again. The Amish are shaping your new furniture with a chisel and a small hammer. Julio's almost at the gates.

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO (KSAT) - A Texas man’s primary means of transportation may be what caused a fire that killed him. Arson investigators said they believe a motorized mobility chair somehow sparked a deadly house fire on Tuesday. Those who knew that man say they’re heartbroken. The charred shell of a home at the corner of Christian and Winneway drives cuts a hole in the hearts of neighbors. It’s a reminder of the man who lived and ultimately died there. “He was friendly, you know, ‘hello,’ you know, got his mail. Occasionally we chat about the yard or whatever,” said Leslie Gill, a neighbor. Gill and her family have lived in the southeast side neighborhood in San Antonio for the past 25 years. She said she was surprised to return home to firefighters putting out flames next door. Wednesday morning, she said she was devastated after learning her neighbor had died. “Just the way that it happened. It’s, it’s sad. It’s very sad,” Gill said. The 68-year-old, whose name wasn’t released right away, apparently used a motorized scooter or mobility chair to get around. “He would come out and the battery would go down. So one day he spent about 45 minutes in the chair trying to get back,” Bular Swain said. Swain said he was amused about the problems in the past, but arson investigators now believe that chair caused the fire. Crews found the victim in the kitchen with a fire extinguisher nearby. “But he was a very funny, friendly man, and we are going to miss him. As a matter of fact, his mom and my grandmother went to school together,” Swain said. To Swain, he was a member of the family, to others an important part of their community. According to people who live nearby, a hearse and limo at the home are actually leftovers from their neighbor’s previous career. They say for many years, he worked in the funeral business.

    "title": "Israel’s Security Agency Ignored Warning from Gaza Source About October 7 Attack",
    "text": "Months before the October 7 attack on southern Israel,\nthe Israeli security agency Shin Bet received a warning from one of its sources in Gaza that Hamas was planning to carry out a “big move” shortly after Yom Kippur, which took place on September 25 this year, Israel’s Channel 12 reported.\nThe report said Shin Bet dismissed the warning as insignificant, and the intelligence did not make it to senior officials in the agency or its chief, Ronen Bar. Shin Bet sources said the lack of corroborating intelligence and the fact that the source only recently started talking to the Israeli agency contributed to the tip not being taken seriously, although they also admitted the source was considered highly reliable.\nThe tip was just one of many pieces of intelligence that was ignored or not taken seriously by the Israeli security establishment, which led to Israel failing to prevent the October 7 Hamas attack.\nThe New York Times\nreported in November that Israel had obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the October 7 attack more than a year before it took place, but Israeli military and intelligence officials did not believe Hamas was capable of carrying it out.\nThe Times report said the document Israel obtained “did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters” and added that Hamas followed the blueprint with “shocking precision.”\nAccording to\nHaaretz, Israeli military officials also ignored warnings from women in the Israeli Defense Forces who worked as “spotters” on the Gaza border. The women spent their days watching surveillance footage and reported unusual Hamas activity for an entire year, but their warnings were not taken seriously.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under intense domestic pressure due to the intelligence failure and his previous strategy of\n helping prop up Hamas to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. Polls show the majority of Israelis want him to resign once the Gaza war is over, giving him incentive to keep the massacre going for as long as he can.",

    "text": "Maybe a Message from Above Can Offer Hope LOS ANGELES, CA - December 28, 2023 - “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest.\nAnd most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.\nWhere to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God.\nDr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org\nMost of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct Quote: s from the Real Reality, and this is one such Quote: pertaining to war:\n\"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals …\nAll the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?”\nAnd this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer:\n“Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\"\nThe question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace.\nDr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org).\nAn example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website:\n\"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\"\n Ascot Media Group, Inc.\nContact Person: Gloria Gonzalez\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 281.333.3507\nAddress: Post Office Box 2394\nCity: Friendswood\nState: TX 77549\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.ascotmedia.com/",

No dejaremos pasar nada\\\", ha indicado Darmanin en la red social X, anteriormente conocida como Twitter.\\r\\n\\r\\n Según el decreto de expulsión, el imán \\\"transmitía una concepción literal, retrógrada, intolerante y violenta del islam, susceptible de fomentar comportamientos contrarios a los valores\\\" de Francia, ha recogido la cadena francesa BFM TV.\\r\\n\\r\\n Entre este tipo de comportamientos, se encuentra \\\"la discriminación contra las mujeres\\\", a quienes define como \\\"inferiores\\\" y que \\\"deben ser guiadas y controladas por los hombres\\\", así como comentarios de odio contra los judíos, a quienes tilda de \\\"aliados del Anticristo\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n \\\"Los comentarios que llaman al odio hacia los judíos e Israel y que defienden la yihad pueden incitar a seguidores a llevar a cabo un acto violento\\\", reza el texto, que agrega que el imán llegó a asegurar en otro de sus sermones que \\\"las mezquitas no crean combatientes como en la época del profeta\\\" Mahoma.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mahjubi, nacido en Túnez y afincado en Francia desde 1986, está casado con una mujer de nacionalidad francesa. Sus sermones levantaron polémica después de que saliese a la luz que había calificado la bandera tricolor de \\\"satánica\\\".",

    "title": "How Colorado auto and catalytic converter theft victims can get money back",
    "text": "Coloradans who had a vehicle or catalytic converter stolen in 2023 may be able to get money to help offset some of the costs of dealing with theft thanks to new funds made available though the state. SB23-257, or the Auto Theft Prevention Cash Fund, made available roughly $5 million of general funds to support victims who need help with secondary costs. “The secondary costs aren’t things like vehicle replacement, or vehicle repair, those would be primary costs. These are secondary things that may be unknown to folks when their vehicle is stolen or recovered that we can assist with,” said Cale Gould, Public Outreach Coordinator with the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority. Fees covered include money to help offset the costs of towing and storing a stolen vehicle. Gould said some of the fees covered are part of dealing with theft that people might not consider. “Generally if it is either operable or part of a larger investigation, it is taken to a tow yard or a police impound lot. And there's fees associated with that,” said Gould. When auto theft victims in Colorado do get their vehicle back, they often find it to be in a less than desirable condition. There is assistance to help cover some of the costs of getting the stolen ride back into better condition. “And this will include detailing, cleaning a vehicle to make it again, you know, usable in a comfortable way,” said Gould. Financial assistance might also be available to help cover the costs of temporary transportation like RTD passes and Uber fees when a vehicle is stolen. Catalytic converter theft in Colorado has skyrocketed over the last few years and the state has made available funds to help those victims with secondary costs. Gould said victims can apply for money to help cover hardening devices to protect your catalytic converter from theft. To qualify for assistance for either auto or catalytic converter theft, the vehicle must have had current registration when the theft occurred. An important date to remember is July 1, 2023. Coloradans can apply for help only if they had their vehicle or catalytic converter stolen after July 1. Coloradans who want to get financial help to cover secondary costs due to auto or catalytic converter theft must apply at lockdownyourcar.org and visit the victim’s assistance page. The site details what is covered and how to apply. Gould said the grant application process is made easier by working through a local advocate. “We try and provide a personal response, personal touch to a single person to guide you through the process as it can be very challenging to understand how to apply,” said Gould. “We want to make sure that everybody applies and has guidance in doing such.” The website, through Colorado State Patrol’s Victim Services Unit lists the various districts throughout the state and which advocate serves your local area. While auto theft in Colorado surged over the last couple of years, the state has seen a decline in 2023. Data from the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority showed 29,098 vehicles were stolen through October of this year. That's a significant decline from the 41,184 vehicles reported stolen in Colorado throughout 2022. The 2023 data does not reflect November or December thefts. The Denver Police Department also reported a 25 percent decline in auto thefts in 2023, showing 11,865 stolen vehicles which is down from the 14,813 reported in 2022. While auto thefts in Denver have declined, catalytic converter thefts continued to climb in data reported by DPD in 2023. DPD statistics showed 3,022 stolen catalytic converters this year compared to 2,676 thefts in 2022. To give context in those numbers, the vast majority of increases in catalytic converter theft in Denver happened at Denver International Airport at DIA's associated parking and rental car lots. There was a staggering 857 percent increase in catalytic converter theft at DIA in 2023. According to DPD's statistics, all other police districts showed a year-over-year decline in catalytic converter thefts.",
