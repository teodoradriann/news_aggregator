    "title": "Buffalo Bills LB Von Miller Makes First Public Comments On Domestic Violence Allegations: ‘Completely Wrong’",
    "text": "Videos by OutKick Buffalo Bills linebacker Von Miller turned himself in to authorities in late November following claims of domestic violence made by his pregnant girlfriend. Miller addressed the media on Thursday regarding the claims in his first public address. The veteran linebacker kept a low profile in the aftermath of his arrest. The 34-year-old Miller shared that nothing out of the ordinary occurred on the night of the alleged incident, calling the allegations of domestic violence “completely wrong and blown out of proportion. Miller, an eight-time Pro Bowler, faced an arrest warrant from the Glenn Heights (Texas) Police Department. Miller’s girlfriend contacted authorities on Nov. 29, and Miller turned himself in the following day. “Obviously, there are things that I can’t talk about but everything that was out is completely wrong and blown out of proportion,” Miller said. He added, “Me and my girlfriend, we have problems just like any other couple does but there has never been any of those things that was alleged against me. Hopefully, over time all of this stuff will get cleared up. Sometimes life just … be life-ing. You’ve just got to keep pushing and keep moving. The people who know me and the people who have been around me know my character, they know who I am.” Time To Move Forward For Von Miller, Bills Miller’s girlfriend accused him of forcefully grabbing her throat, pulling her hair and causing additional bruising. She later [changed her story](https://www.outkick.com/von-miller-girlfriend-assault-claims-not-true-pregnant/), absolving Miller of using force toward her. “We’re fine. Things were blown way out of context. This is actually outrageous,” she said. Miller did not miss time on the field as a result of his arrest. OutKick’s Armando Salguero commented on the implications of Miller’s resurfacing. He considered it a positive sign for Miller and the Bills moving forward, evidently leaving the scandal in the past. “The fact he’s talking again means both he and the team are comfortable,” Salguero noted, “the worst is behind him. They feel safe.” Despite the turbulence of the claims, Buffalo stuck with Miller, dodging a rash decision and waiting for further proof. Buffalo released a statement acknowledging the claims made against Miller. “We were made aware of an incident involving Von Miller. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have no further comment at this point,” the team announced. On OutKick’s “The Five Spot,” Salguero and Donovan McNabb discussed whether the fallout of Matt Araiza’s run-in with false allegations influenced the Bills’ decision with Miller.

    "text": "Tier war in Notsituation\nHund Leon verhält sich komisch und wird so zum Lebensretter\nGrünkraut / Lesedauer: 2 min\nZuerst war alles wie immer: Tobias Veit, Bauhofleiter von Grünkraut und Bodnegg, nutzte seine Mittagspause für einen Spaziergang mit seinem Hund Leon. „Wir laufen verschiedene Strecken, aber oft sind wir am Grünkrauter Weiher unterwegs“, berichtet Veit.\nLeon sei zunächst wie immer schwanzwedelnd vorangegangen, dann aber plötzlich stehen geblieben. Der Hund habe „gefiepst und gegrummelt“, sagt der Besitzer. Er habe ihn gerufen, und Leon sei auch gekommen, sei dann aber zurückgelaufen und habe wieder mit starrem Blick auf den Weiher geschaut.\nDas Drama spielte sich auf einer Insel ab\n„Das ist untypisch“, sagt Tobias Veit. Also ging er zurück zu der Stelle, an der sein Hund stehen geblieben war. „Erst habe ich nichts erkennen können, aber dann habe ich gesehen, dass im Weiher eine Ente war, die gezappelt hat. Das Tier hing offenbar an einem Baum fest, der von der Insel des Weihers ins Wasser ragte, und konnte sich nicht allein befreien.\nDas Problem bei der Sache: Da sich das Ganze an der Insel im Wasser abspielte, konnte Tobias Veit die Ente nicht erreichen. Auch der Bauhof hätte in diesem Fall nichts ausrichten können. Veit informierte daher die Verwaltung, und diese wiederum die Feuerwehr.\nHappy End und Leckerli für Leon\nDie kam mit einem Ruderboot und schaute nach, was mit der Ente los war. Wie sich herausstellte, hing das Tier an einem Angelhakenfest, dessen Schnur sich in dem Baum verfangen hatte. Die Feuerwehrleute befreiten die Ente aus ihrer misslichen Lage. „Ohne diese Hilfe wäre sie wahrscheinlich verendet“, vermutet Tobias Veit.\nDoch so gab es ein Happy End, und Hund Leon wurde gelobt und bekam ein Leckerli. Wobei es dem Rüden wahrscheinlich gar nicht bewusst war, dass die Ente in einer Notlage steckte, wie sein Besitzer erklärt: Leon sei zwar sehr aufmerksam. „Hauptsächlich sieht er aber in allem, was sich bewegt, einen Spielkameraden.“",

    "text": "BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - After months of waiting due to construction delays, Mandan High School’s newest piece will be presented to the public on Friday night. “It’s exciting,” Mandan Athletic Director Mark Wiest said. “It’s finally here. We’ve waited patiently.” It’s been a laborious effort from start to finish with a race to beat the buzzer when it comes to the final minor details of the new Mandan High School gym. Things are being finalized Thursday and Friday before the new gym hosts games, but Wiest said they could host games any day if needed. The Braves have been practicing in the new gym since Monday. The hope is that Mandan’s new facility will be a key piece in bringing new events to Mandan’s community. The Braves are already set to host the Optimist Volleyball games next year, as well as the WDA Volleyball tournament. “There’s a lot of different things we would like to be a part of,” Wiest said. “When you have a facility like this that when kids walk in here and other communities walk in here they’re going to really like it and really want to be back and see more different other activities in here.” A lot of the new gym is designed with similarities to the University of Jamestown’s Harold Newman arena, including the barreled roof. “Just so many different features that when people come in here, it’s going to be a wow factor,” Wiest said. The design, featuring seating on all four sides, can host upwards of 2,500 people. There’s a unique multi-colored court, a center-hanging video board, and all-new scoreboards, lighting and sound systems to increase the game day experience. Wiest said he fully expects there to be tweaks after game one, but Friday and Saturday night will set the foundation for the future of sporting events at Mandan High School. “We’ll sit down next week, we’ll review everything, we’ll re-evaluate,” Wiest said. “We might just take the paper, throw it all away and just start over again. Hopefully, we don’t, but that’s what you’ve got to do. We’ve got to start someplace.” The Braves tip off the Class AA basketball season Friday night against Fargo North. Copyright 2024 KFYR.

    "text": "[by Derek Major](https://www.blackenterprise.com/author/majord/) December 28, 2023 Memphis Grizzlies Guard JA Morant Responds To Criticism For Celebration In Win Over New Orleans Pelicans He was literally dancing. :-/ Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant responded to the heavy scrutiny he faced following a celebration after a big dunk during Tuesday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Sports Illustrated [reported ](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/12/27/grizzlies-ja-morant-celebration-criticism-responds-reaction-rock-ya-hips?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&fs=e&s=cl)after the win, Morant celebrated by dancing toward the crowd. However, many people on social media believed he was miming shooting fake guns. The celebration comes just four games after Morant served a 25-game suspension stemming from the Grizzlies guard showing guns on Instagram Live twice. Morant responded to the criticisms on the X app, formerly known as Twitter, indicating that he was dancing and not firing weapons. The Grizzlies struggled without Morant during his 25-game suspension, starting the season 6-19. However, since Morant’s return, the Grizzlies have won four straight games, and the point guard has led the team in points for two of the wins and assists in all four. The Murray State [product](https://www.blackenterprise.com/tag/ja-morant/) was named the Western Conference [player of the week](https://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/grizzlies-ja-morant-named-nba-western-conference-player-of-the-week-122623) following his return. Morant has averaged 28.8 points, 8.5 assists, and 5.3 rebounds while shooting 50.6% from the field in the four games he’s played in. Morant, named the 2019-20 Rookie of the Year, has enjoyed a fantastic start to his career. The two-time All-Star won the 2021-22 Most Improved Player award and was named to the All-NBA second team. However, the All-Star guard was suspended in June after he was seen on Instagram Live flashing a gun. It was the second time he was caught on social media with a firearm in his hand. The 23-year-old was first suspended for eight games in March after he was shown with a gun on an Instagram Live video at a Denver nightclub. The Grizzlies are currently 10-19 and in 13th place in the Western Conference. As bad as their start was, they’re just five games out of a playoff spot with more than a month to go before the regular season’s halfway point. The Grizzlies start a two-game road trip Thursday against the Denver Nuggets and the L.A. Clippers before heading home to host the Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs.",
