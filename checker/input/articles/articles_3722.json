    "text": "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi flashes victory sign as he arrives at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters to celebrate the party’s win in country's general election, in New Delhi on Tuesday.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India’s general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party losing its majority in the lower house of parliament. Modi has said he’ll remain in office for a third term, but the BJP now needs to forge a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. The situation leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues.\nWhat happened in the Indian election?\nAfter a marathon six-week election, results showed Modi’s BJP failed to win the necessary 272 parliamentary seats needed to form a government on its own. An alliance of more than 20 opposition groups led by the Indian National Congress gained ground in a number of key constituencies. The BJP’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, still crossed the majority mark as a bloc. But without an outright majority of its own, the BJP will have to govern with partners now. The election result was a shock outcome after exit polls three days earlier predicted a landslide win for the BJP-led coalition, although anecdotal reports in recent weeks had highlighted the possibility of the ruling party losing support, especially in strongholds like Uttar Pradesh state.\nWhat comes next?\nModi has vowed to continue as India’s prime minister despite his party’s loss of its majority. Under India’s parliamentary system, if a single party fails to capture a parliamentary majority, then the party with the most votes will look to form a coalition government. Modi’s alliance is made up of a number of partners, some more shaky in their allegiance than others. If Modi fails to win enough support to return as prime minister, they could demand a different leader or defect to the opposition, throwing the country’s leadership into question — though there aren’t indications that’s likely to happen. For much of India’s recent history, coalition governments were the norm, and such governments have been credited with producing noteworthy achievements, such as the opening of the Indian economy in the early 1990s.\nWhat went wrong for Modi and his party?\nThe BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to gain enough traction among voters worried that the economy — while among the world’s fastest-growing — isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the young, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Meanwhile, some analysts said the BJP’s overly ambitious election target of 400 seats with its allies likely backfired, prompting some supporters not to bother turning out, and raising fears the ruling party would use its super majority to reduce affirmative action policies for some minority groups. Despite Modi campaigning heavily in the southern states, the BJP also failed to make inroads there, with the party’s pro-Hindu message failing to gain traction.\nWhat does this mean for India?\nMany of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation. It may also force the BJP to offer cabinet posts and other concessions to alliance partners. On the economic front, a BJP-led government will likely continue to pursue its business-friendly policies, but a weakened mandate means it may struggle to enact ambitious reforms around labour and land rules, which economists say are necessary to keep growth going. To shore up support, a BJP-led government may be tempted to turn to populist spending measures, putting its fiscal plans at risk.\nWhat does this mean for the rest of the world?\nUnder Modi, India’s profile on the world stage has grown significantly, helped by its robust 8%-plus rate of economic growth and a young and growing population that makes it a draw for foreign businesses. Modi has sought to cultivate a deeper partnership with the US, which sees India as a critical counterweight to China, while also maintaining strategic independence that has seen it refuse to join the West in condemning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine or shun its oil exports. Analysts don’t see those positions as likely to change anytime soon. The same goes for Modi’s ambitions to make India a global manufacturing hub and continue luring foreign investors on the hunt for the next growth story as China’s economy slows.",

    "text": "Volkswagen AG workers across Germany plan to stage walkouts starting Monday after labor leaders and management failed to reach an agreement over how to slash costs at the carmaker’s namesake brand. Bloomberg Published 1 Dec 2024, 05:14 PM IST VW Union to Start Walkouts on Monday Over Cost-Cutting Plans (Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG workers across Germany plan to stage walkouts starting Monday after labor leaders and management failed to reach an agreement over how to slash costs at the carmaker’s namesake brand.\n“If necessary, this will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen,” said Thorsten Groeger, the IG Metall union’s lead negotiator in the VW talks. Warning strikes will begin at all plants, he added.\n“Volkswagen has set fire to our collective agreements,” Groeger said, adding that actions by management were making the situation worse.\nThe company is seeking a constructive dialogue to achieve a jointly supported solution, a Volkswagen spokesman said on Sunday, adding that the company has taken specific measures in response to the planned walkouts.\nVolkswagen on Friday dismissed the unionists’ most recent proposals to avoid factory closures as insufficient.\nVW’s management and labor leaders have been at loggerheads over how to cope with a drop in demand for electric vehicles, higher operational costs and increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers.\nWhile management has said the company needs to shutter three German factories and lay off thousands of workers, union representatives have pushed to keep plants open.\nIn Germany, unions often organize warning strikes — or temporary walkouts — to put pressure on management when wage negotiations are deadlocked.\nVW’s corporate structure gives workers a strong voice in key decisions, making it difficult for management to unilaterally push through painful cost cuts. Employee representatives occupy half of the company’s supervisory board seats, while VW’s home state of Lower Saxony holds an additional two seats.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "text": "O trânsito no Brasil está em constante evolução, e as recentes propostas de mudanças no [Código de Trânsito Brasileiro (CTB)](https://istoe.com.br/istoegeral/?s=C%C3%B3digo+de+Tr%C3%A2nsito+Brasileiro+%28CTB%29) refletem essa dinâmica. As alterações em discussão procuram reorganizar a forma como as multas de trânsito são administradas, trazendo possíveis consequências para motoristas em todo o país. Nesse cenário, é crucial entender como essas mudanças podem afetar tanto a fiscalização quanto a responsabilização por infrações nas vias públicas. Um dos principais objetivos das novas propostas é melhorar a eficácia da fiscalização no trânsito, com um enfoque renovado na função dos agentes de trânsito. Essas alterações, ainda em fase de análise, podem modificar profundamente o modo como motoristas interagem com o sistema de penalidades. Redefinindo a Aplicação de Multas de Trânsito Atualmente, está em tramitação um projeto de lei que visa alterações significativas na aplicação de multas de trânsito no Brasil. De acordo com o Projeto de Lei 3.663/2024, a responsabilidade por aplicar penalidades seria restringida exclusivamente aos agentes estaduais. Essa medida pretende evitar sobreposição de funções e conflitos que podem surgir entre agentes de diferentes esferas governamentais. Com a centralização das atribuições de multa, espera-se que o processo de fiscalização se torne mais organizado. Enquanto isso, os agentes municipais passariam a focar em atividades educativas e orientativas, contribuindo para a conscientização dos motoristas sobre as boas práticas no trânsito. Como Monitorar Infrações de Trânsito? A tecnologia tem facilitado diversas partes do cotidiano, incluindo a verificação de infrações de trânsito que um motorista possa ter cometido. Agora, é possível acessar essas informações online, o que representa praticidade e rapidez no acompanhamento das condições legais de condução. Para realizar a consulta de infrações, siga estas etapas: - Acessar o site do Detran do seu estado: Aqui, é possível encontrar uma seção específico para consulta de infrações. - Inserir dados do veículo: Será necessário ter a placa e o Renavam do veículo, que estão no documento oficial do carro. - Avaliar as infrações listadas: O sistema exibirá multas em aberto e já pagas, com detalhes sobre cada ocorrência. - Utilizar aplicativos móveis: Muitos Detrans dispõem de aplicativos para fácil consulta e outras funcionalidades, como o pagamento de multas. - Consultar o portal nacional: O Sistema de Notificação Eletrônica (SNE) oferece uma plataforma unificada para consulta de multas em todo o território nacional. Orientação ou Punição: Qual o Melhor Caminho? A dinâmica entre orientação e punição está no centro das discussões sobre as mudanças no Código de Trânsito Brasileiro. Ao focar em orientação, a proposta pretende diminuir a frequência de infrações por meio de educação. A longo prazo, essa abordagem pode resultar em menos motoristas cometendo erros, o que é benéfico para todos os usuários das vias. A implementação dessas mudanças depende da aprovação legislativa e será crucial observar como isso se desenrolará nos próximos anos, acompanhando a evolução do trânsito brasileiro frente a novas normas e desafios.",
