    "title": "Canada Jetlines becomes latest victim of cutthroat airline sector",
    "text": "Less than two years after it first hit the skies, Canada Jetlines has grounded its planes and ceased operations amid a cash crisis that caused it to become the third Canadian carrier in less than a year to stop flying. The low-cost airline, which flew mainly to sun destinations out of Toronto on top of leases and charter trips, said Thursday it failed to find the capital needed to stay afloat and planned to file for creditor protection. \"The company ... pursued all available financing alternatives including strategic transactions and equity and debt financings,\" said spokeswoman Erica Dymond in a release. \"Unfortunately despite these efforts, the company has been unable to obtain the financing required to continue operations at this time.\" Passengers with existing bookings should contact their credit card company to secure refunds, she said. \"Every effort is being made to assist passengers at this time.\" Trading of the company's shares on the NEO Exchange was halted late Wednesday afternoon. The shutdown follows the resignation of four board members on Monday, including chairwoman and CEO Brigitte Goersch. It signals yet another airline departure from Canadian skies after the closure of Lynx Air in February and budget carrier Swoop last October as concerns about domestic competition persist. \"Any time you lose some competition in the Canadian market it's kind of sad for the travellers, because it puts less pressure on prices,\" said Jacques Roy, a professor of transport management at HEC Montreal business school. Founded in 2013 as a would-be charter airline, Canada Jetlines accounted for only a fraction of scheduled flights to sun destinations, he qualified. The shutdown also underscores the challenges of running a carrier in a vast country with a diffuse population and only a few key air travel hubs. \"Every time a new player wants to enter the market, there's only one certainty: they're going to be losing money for the first eight, nine, 10 months at least, and perhaps even more. So you need a good bank account,\" said Roy, noting that leisure travellers are particularly price-sensitive. \"The major players will play the game of meeting your fares. And if you reduce your fares below your cost, then that's a recipe for failure in the short term,\" he said. \"It's a tough market.\" Until Thursday, Jetlines was flying a few dozen flights per month from Toronto to Miami and Orlando, Fla., as well as Cancun, Mexico, according to aviation tracking firm Cirium. It also flew charter flights, including for three Canadian Football League teams. The airline signed contracts with the Ottawa Redblacks, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts that saw it haul players to select away games last season. The Redblacks contract was a three-year deal that may no longer be fulfilled. Thursday's halt leaves only one budget carrier left in Canada — Flair Airlines — alongside the other major players: Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and the WestJet-owned Sunwing Airlines. Last month, competition commissioner Matthew Boswell launched a market study of domestic airline service amid passengers' ongoing frustration with prices and quality. Canada Jetlines, which has struggled to get more than a handful of planes off the ground since its inaugural flight in September 2022, faced a series of hiccups even before this week's turbulence. On June 30, Eddy Doyle stepped down as CEO after taking on the role in 2021. In October 2022, former Quebec premier Jean Charest resigned from the board. The challenges it faced in its home market were evident. In January 2023, it pressed pause on domestic routes as the carrier refocused on sun destinations and leasing its planes, but said at the time it aimed to resume in-country flights that fall. Last April, it signed over a pair of Airbus narrow-body jets to a European carrier for most of the remaining year in a so-called wet lease — where the lessor furnishes the aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance for another company. It also deployed two more planes for flights between Morocco and Western Europe in a three-month agreement with Air Arabia. In October 2019, the Mississauga, Ont.-based company announced it was postponing its planned December launch and laying off most employees after failing to secure the required financing and losing investment partners. The delay wound up dragging on for nearly three years, thanks in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. That 2019 setback followed six years of fundraising and despite Ottawa lifting the foreign ownership ceiling on Canadian airlines to 49 per cent from 25 per cent in 2018, allowing for a wider pool of investors. Canada Jetlines lost $14.2 million over the 12 months between March 2023 and last March, though it eked out a profit in one of the quarters, according to financial filings. Quarterly revenues ranged between $8 million and $12 million. In May, the company secured a $2-million loan from Square Financial Investment Corp., a Mississauga-based holding company owned by board member Reg Christian, who was named executive vice-president as a result. Jetlines had a $38.3-million deficit and negative working capital of $14.9 million as of March 31. As recently as May 10, the company said in financial statements it planned to grow to seven planes by year's end and 15 aircraft by 2026.

    "title": "Made in WNY: Worksport turns truck beds into a power source",
    "text": "Imagine turning a truck bed cover into a mobile solar power producer.\nWorksport is developing that technology for manufacturing at its West Seneca plant, a product the company sees as a breakthrough.\nThe company already makes traditional covers for truck beds – called tonneau covers – at its North America Drive facility. Worksport is preparing to add to its lineup the SOLIS, which integrates solar panels with a folding truck bed cover.\nWhen the SOLIS is connected with Worksport's battery system, it creates a portable power source that can be used at worksites and campsites, among other uses.\n\"We know we have an advantage,\" said Steve Rossi, the CEO. \"We know we have an exciting product.\"\nWorksport has made West Seneca the hub of its emerging manufacturing. The company bought the former Certo Brothers distribution center on North America Drive for $8 million and shifted its headquarters there from Toronto.\nPeople are also reading…\nWorksport has 36 employees and recently announced plans to invest $6 million in the facility and add 280 jobs over five years.\nRossi saw advantages in moving Worksport's operations to Western New York. Facilities in Toronto were \"three or four times the price,\" and the incentives here were appealing, he said. New York State has pledged up to $2.8 million in Excelsior Jobs tax credits in exchange for the company reaching its hiring targets.\nIts savings on energy costs – thanks to an allocation of low-cost hydropower from the New York Power Authority – also were significant, he said. And basing the operations in the United States removed potential complications with cross-border shipments, while tapping into the region's transportation networks.\nWhen Rossi was scouting buildings to acquire, he saw an image of the former Certo Brothers building, surrounded by green space, and wasn't convinced it was an authentic picture. Once company officials visited in person, they were confident they had found their ideal location. There's also room to expand next door, which Rossi is contemplating.\nAs Worksport has taken root here, Rossi encouraged manufacturing veteran Jeff Schutrum to come out of retirement, first as a consultant and now as the plant manager. Schutrum, a University at Buffalo graduate, formerly ran an Edwards Vacuum plant on Grand Island, and then worked for Compass Group USA, handling projects to support Microsoft.\n\"It's a good chance to build something,\" Schutrum said of his new assignment.\nWorking alongside Rossi as chief operating officer is Chris Bernaudo. The two have been friends for about 30 years. Bernaudo recalled when Rossi was selling tonneau covers out of a parts store at a brisk pace.\n\"He thought, 'I could do it better,' \" Bernaudo said.\nNow those plans are taking shape.\nWorksport currently makes 50 to 100 tonneau covers a day, but plans to increase its production capacity to 1,000 covers a day. Rossi said he sees signs of growing demand from customers.\n\"UPS can't pick up by the truckload any more, they've got to send a tractor (trailer),\" he said.\nWorksport in the first quarter reported a loss of $3.7 million on sales of about $513,000. More recently, the company said it generated over $739,000 in revenues in May, its highest-ever monthly sales figure.\nWorksport has provided full-year revenue guidance of $6 million to $8 million, compared to the $1.53 million in sales recorded in 2023.\nAs Worksport builds up its local presence, it has high hopes for the SOLIS, viewing it as a breakthrough product within the tonneau cover industry. Worksport estimates if it can capture just 5% of the U.S. tonneau cover market with the SOLIS, that product line alone would generate about $300 million in revenues annually.\nThe foldable SOLIS aluminum tonneau cover connects via cable to a COR generator - produced by Worksport - inside the truck bed. Worksport recently disclosed its SOLIS covers will be compatible not only with the company's own generator but most other portable power stations and power banks on the market, as well.\nRossi said the SOLIS will be priced starting at $1,500. Other hard tonneau covers on the market range in price from a few hundred dollars to over $1,000.\nLonger-range, Rossi hopes to make it possible for the SOLIS to connect directly to electric vehicles, providing a fuel source for them. The company also plans to bring in production of soft tonneau covers; those products currently imported from China.\nMeanwhile, Rossi has been making local connections.\nPeter Ahrens, executive director of the Buffalo Niagara Manufacturing Alliance, has made some introductions for Rossi and is impressed by his plans.\n\"He's a bright mind and he has a nice strategic overview of his market and making that differentiator,\" Ahrens said.\nRossi also brings an open mind to leading his company, Ahrens said. \"He's always willing to learn, he's always willing to hear about programs that could benefit his company and get his plant up and running quicker and marketing his products efficiently.\"\nWorksport received help from Invest Buffalo Niagara to get established in the Buffalo area, including connecting with employees to hire. Rossi is using local suppliers wherever possible. And he is struck by the reception Worksport has received since coming to town.\n\"Every turn has been like a, 'Call me, how can I help?'\" Rossi said. \"There's a real strong sense of that pride in community.\"",

    "title": "Indegna accusa a Meloni malata, Ferragni in trincea e De Luca: quindi, oggi... - ilGiornale.it",
    "text": "- Trovo indegno che si pensi che Giorgia Meloni voglia volontariamente rimandare la conferenza stampa. I giornalisti che scrivono gli articoli sulla sua malattia, un fastidio agli otoliti che dà vertigini, ipersensibilità alla luce e nausea, pur senza scriverlo lasciano intendere che se lo sia quasi inventato per non presentarsi di fronte ai \"cani da guardia del potere\". Chiunque altro sarebbe stato compatito, lei no. Addirittura Repubblica arriva a paragonarla a Biden alludendo a \"problemi di salute\" che rischiano di \"diventare un caso a sé\" perché \"l'integrità fisica è fondamentale per guidare un Paese\". Cioè: il premier si ammala e annulla solo sei impegni (su migliaia realizzati in un anno) e dovremmo preoccuparci per la tenuta politica del leader di governo?\n- Sapete cosa mi fa impazzire? Che questi poi sono gli stessi che applaudivano Sanna Marin quando decise di mollare la politica perché \"questi anni hanno messo a dura prova la mia resistenza\". E sono gli stessi che hanno sprecato litri di inchiostro per elogiare \"la lezione di Jacinda Ardern \" quando l'ex premier neozelandese si dimise perché non aveva \"più l’energia per continuare\". Patetici.\n- Antonella Viola parla di molestie subite in Italia e all’estero all’università, quando era ricercatrice, ma non fa né nomi né cognomi. Forse non ha le prove e non può rischiare un querelone enorme. Però resto dell’idea che svegliarsi dopo decenni, quando la carriera è avviata e sei un personaggio bello in vista, peraltro senza dare indicazioni di sorta, è troppo semplice.\n- La Treccani segue l’Espresso e sceglie che quest’anno la parola del 2023 è “ femminicidio ”. Una scelta, si legge sul sito dell'Istituto, che \"evidenzia l'urgenza di porre l'attenzione sul fenomeno della violenza di genere, per stimolare la riflessione e promuovere un dibattito costruttivo intorno a un tema che è prima di tutto culturale\". Bla, bla, bla. Che barba, che noia. Era meglio scegliere \"petaloso\".\n- A Cerreto Guidi, nel Fiorentino, un ragazzo suona per scherzo un campanello e viene accoltellato. Solo ora mi accorgo di quante volte ho rischiato la vita da bambino.\n- Il video di Vincenzo De Luca : gli tolgono la sedia da dietro il sedere e lui va gambe all’aria a peso morto. Neppure nei nostri migliori sogni, il 2023 poteva regalarci una gag così dal più teatrale dei personaggi politici. Per fortuna non si è fatto nulla, ma fa ridere a crepapelle.\n- Lavinia Mennuni nella bufera per le sue frasi sulla maternità. Sintesi di Repubblica : “Ricordare alle nostre figlie che la loro massima aspirazione deve essere quella di diventare madre”. Il Corriere : “Le ragazze secondo Mennuni: ‘Fare figli è la loro missione’”. In entrambi i casi, si tratta di bufale. Basta ascoltare il video originale: dice chiaramente che le donne possono fare quello che vogliono, hanno diritto ad ogni aspirazione lavorativa, ma che è importante ricordare alle nostre figlie come diventare madri sia bello e importante, diciamo pure necessario per la società. Il principio è che bisogna cambiare culturalmente l’approccio alla maternità, oggi vista come un dramma e che invece è il fondamento di ogni popolo. Non c’è niente di medievale, no?\n- Ps: il discorso vale, simile, anche per i maschi (un figlio va sempre fatto in due). Eppure il discorso per i due sessi non può essere identico. Anche volendo, un uomo non può passare nove mesi in gravidanza.\n- Interssante invito alla Lega da parte di Lorenzo Fontana , leghista presidente della Camera. In vista delle europee, dice, è preferibile non “tenere i voti in congelatore” ma “mettersi in gioco”. Molto meglio far parte del cambiamento in Ue e se possibile partecipare all’elezione del presidente della Commissione. Cioè, ci pare di poter tradurre: qualora necessario, abbandonare la nave sovranista con Afd e Le Pen per abbracciare il progetto conservatore della Meloni.\n- Gli Usa inviano gli ultimi 250 milioni di dollari di aiuti all’Ucraina. Adesso i soldi sono finiti, almeno fino a che il Congresso non approverà il prossimo pacchetto da 61 miliardi di dollari. I Repubblicani chiedono a Biden di varare leggi restrittive sull’immigrazione in cambio del voto sugli aiuti a Kiev. Tutti a ribadire che il sostegno a Zelensky è “ostaggio” trumpiani brutti e cattivi, ma nessuno che si domandi: perché Biden non concede quello che chiedono? In fondo è in minoranza al Congresso, dunque democrazia vorrebbe che quando necessario scendesse almeno a compromessi.\n- Ogni giorno che passa, una brutta notizia per Chiara Ferragni . Oggi è il turno dell'apertura dell'indagine a Prato. Ormai l'influencer è in trincea e fa quasi tenerezza.\n- Intanto, alla faccia delle decine di titoli di Repubblica nei mesi scorsi, l’Ue ha pagato l’ennesima rata del Pnrr. Senza ritardo alcuno.\n- Lancio su X di Repubblica : “Stati Uniti, la rivolta dei robot: androide aggredisce un ingegnere della Testa”. È una bufala, e pure di quelle grosse. Primo: non c’è stata nessuna rivolta dei robot. Secondo: non riguarda le macchine umanoidi “ Optimus ”, ma un braccio meccanico di una fabbrica come ce ne sono a migliaia in giro per il mondo. Terzo: Elon Musk ha smentito la notizia, ma non mi pare che i debunker siano andati a fare le pulci a Rep o al Corriere . Da quando Elon Musk è diventato all’improvviso brutto e cattivo, nonostante le auto elettriche e tutto il resto, non sprecano occasione per screditarlo. Stavolta però la figuraccia è grossa.",

    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos San Bartolomé de Tirajana Viernes, 28 de junio 2024, 02:00 Necesitas ser registrado para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Opciones para compartir El concejal de Deportes en San Bartolomé de Tirajana, Ramón Suárez, llegó a plantearse estos días renunciar a su cargo tras las duras críticas en redes sociales por el mal estado de las instalaciones del Estadio de Maspalomas. El Ayuntamiento se las cedió a la Federación Canaria de Atletismo para que celebrara este domingo el campeonato de Canarias sub8 y sub10, pero los asistentes salieron muy descontentos por la falta de limpieza y el deterioro de baños y graderío. Fue solo un amago. El edil seguirá. El propio Suárez reconoció a este periódico que llegó a sentirse muy afectado por las molestias causadas al público que asistió, máxime cuando, según aclaró, todo fue producto de un malentendido. De entrada, dice que no estaba previsto que hubiera espectadores. El graderío no reúne condiciones. Y en segundo lugar, se queja de que alguien se saltó el cierre que impedía el acceso a unos aseos que estaban en mal estado y que luego fueron los que protagonizaron las fotos difundidas en redes sociales. Suárez recordó que el estadio está pendiente de una reforma casi integral que se iniciará por el cambio del césped y la homologación de las pistas de atletismo. Tanto el PSOE como NC coincidieron en aprovechar el capítulo de ruegos y preguntas para visibilizar en la sesión corporativa de este jueves el malestar causado por las instalaciones del estadio. NC se quejó de que, un año después, el gobierno pretenda seguir culpando al ejecutivo anterior de lo que pasó este fin de semana, mientras que el PSOE pidió explicaciones. El alcalde, Marco Aurelio Pérez, culpó de lo sucedido a la federación porque incumplió una declaración jurada previa en la que se responsabilizaba de la limpieza de las dependencias durante y después del campeonato.
