    "text": "SANTA FE, N.M: More than 1,000 firefighters in New Mexico took advantage of a break in the weather on Thursday to get the upper hand — for now — on a pair of wildfires that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee.\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico, freeing up funding and more resources as crews worked to keep the flames from spreading.\nAlso Read Threat of wildfires is rising, so are new artificial intelligence solutions to fight them Wildfires in Sicily Claim Two Lives, Prompting Evacuations of Hundreds Their efforts have gotten a boost from a storm system that brought with it rain, hail and cooler temperatures to the mountain village of Ruidoso and other parts of the State.\n“The fire has lost momentum,” Arthur Gonzales, the fire behaviour analyst for the federal attack team, told residents at a community meeting in Alamogordo on Thursday night.\n“We still have a lot of work to do, but it’s really changed that fire behavior,” he said, noting that very little growth is expected over the next few days. But firefighters know it’s a brief respite given the dry tinderbox conditions that helped fuel the fires in the first place. Within days, the fires have consumed an area half the size of Washington, D.C .\n“What we’re really focusing on now at this point, is when might we see this return to active fire spread?” Gonzales said. “Is there potential for this to start picking up and moving again?” Federal and local officials said evacuation orders likely would remain in place for days in some places as crews snuff out hot spots around Ruidoso and law officers patrol streets to keep potential looters away.\nDespite some reports that the fires were “human caused,” federal incident commander Dave Gessar said the causes are under investigation and remain “undetermined.”\nThe federal disaster declaration will help with recovery efforts, including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe. Residents fled the larger of the two fires with little notice as it swept into neighborhoods on Monday.\nMore areas were evacuated on Tuesday as the fire ballooned, consuming homes nestled among the the ponderosa pines that dominate the hillsides. An estimated 1,400 structures have been destroyed or damaged, and Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford has estimated about half were homes. Whole portions of some communities were lost, he said.\n“These are things that are burnt to the foundations and all the trees around it,” he said. “It’s devastating.” Authorities say a 60-year-old man who died was found near the popular Swiss Chalet Inn in Ruidoso. His family said he had arranged for a ride from friends but they were unable to get to him Monday since the roads were blocked.\nIt appeared he was overcome after he tried to set out on foot.On Wednesday, officers discovered the skeletal remains of an unidentified second person in the driver’s seat of a burned vehicle.A couple of residents have been driving around Ruidoso and neighboring Alto, providing reports via social media of what they are seeing.",

    "text": "Metropolitan Yevstratiy, the Deputy Head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine’s External Church Relations, accuses the Russian Orthodox Church of being nothing more than an arm of the Kremlin, doing the bidding of President Vladimir Putin, the proverbial ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’. In this case, religious vestments, and telling Russian soldiers fighting against Ukraine that if they die in battle, they will immediately go to paradise, all sins forgiven. In 2019, Ukraine’s Orthodox Church was granted independence from the Russian Orthodox Church. It caused an uproar in Moscow. Kirill and Putin refused to recognize the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Constantinople (modern day Istanbul, Turkey) that authorized Ukraine’s identity as an Autocephalous Church. That Russia is engaged in a Holy War is not in question. But it’s Patriarch Kirill in Moscow, says Yevstratiy, that claims the Russian aggression against Ukraine is for the “Liberation of Ukrainians from Godless West… From the evil.” And to, “bring to Ukraine the light and truth.” On this episode of Lighthouse Faith podcast, Metropolitan Yevstratiy also reveals a scarier version of the war in Ukraine; that Putin and Kirill want to make Moscow the third and final Rome, labeling the rest of Christianity, Catholics and Protestants alike as heretics and pagans. As President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth look for diplomatic solutions to the war’s end, Yevstratiy and His Beatitude Metropolitan Epiphany, the leader of the OCU, are faithful that God Himself will bring an end to the battle.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "text": "It caused havoc for aviation, with flights being cancelled across the countries.\nAir traffic restrictions saw major delays at Heathrow, with flight cancellations across the UK, including Manchester and Glasgow.\nThe UK's flag carrier British Airways cancelled 13 flights because of the weather. In Ireland, Dublin Airport remained unscathed, though Cork saw four diversions, to Dublin and Shannon.\nPlanes that managed to take off faced an equally difficult fate: trying to land in the storm.\nOne American Airlines flight was caught on camera during a particularly bumpy landing at Heathrow on December 27.\nThe Boeing 777, coming in from Los Angeles, was seen wobbling from side to side as it came down, toppling briefly towards the left, before appearing to bounce or \"bunny hop\" on the runway before sticking to terra firma and slowing down.\nThe \"insane\" landing was filmed by Big Jet TV owner Jerry Dyer, who regularly sets up livestreams at airports around the world to watch flights coming in, and has a particular soft spot for stormy weather.\nDyer told CNN in 2022 that he's drawn to the \"battle\" between man and nature during a storm at an airport.\n\"Whenever there's windy conditions, stormy conditions, I'm always up at Heathrow,\" he said at the time.\nThe most nerve-jangling airports for pilots in the world\n\"It's a lot more exciting to watch than aircraft just landing down and touching down and all that kind of stuff. It's the battle, isn't it? It's the forces of nature against an alloy tub with wings on it that we built and we have to control it down onto the ground in Mother Nature's winds.\n\"It's a fantastic thing to watch.\"\nHis\nlivestream of Storm Eunicein 2022, in which planes battled to land at Heathrow despite 122 mile-per-hour winds battering the UK, captivated the entire country.\nThere were more than 200 severe wind gust reports across Britain and Ireland on Wednesday, with a possible tornado sighting in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester.\nA level two of three threat for a severe storm remained for far south-eastern Ireland and west-central UK until early Thursday morning, according to the European Storm Forecast Experiment.\nStreaming the AA flight, Dyer's famously enthusiastic commentary noted the air \"vortex\" around the wings as it came in, before lamenting \"oh stop it, stop that\" as the plane bounced down the runway.\n\"How he did not go around I just have no idea,\" he commented.\nDespite the conditions, flight AA134, which had departed LA on December 26, touched down just one minute late – at 11.41am on December 27, according to flight tracker FlightRadar.\nIt then took off again about two hours later, making its way to Dallas, where it landed early. Luckily with a different crew.",
