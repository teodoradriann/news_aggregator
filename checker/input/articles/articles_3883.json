    "text": "Por Tania Galván - Miami abril 18, 2024 5:49 pm EDT Para Adamari López no hay papel más importante en la vida que el de mamá de Alaïa . Durante su visita al programa de Adrián Uribe , De noche, pero sin sueño , la presentadora se sinceró y reveló la razón detrás de su decisión de alejarse de la actuación. Aunque la puertorriqueña cuenta con una extensa experiencia en las telenovelas, género en el que comenzó su carrera como actriz, reconoce que el trabajo en los foros es muy demandante, por lo que ha preferido mantenerse en la línea de la conducción y así compaginar su profesión con la maternidad.\n©GettyImages El tiempo con su hija es sagrado Durante una de las divertidas dinámicas del conductor, Adamari respondió qué le gustaba más, la actuación o la conducción, sincera, dijo: “En este momento, conducir me da la oportunidad de estar más tiempo con mi hija, no quiere decir que estoy cerrada a la actuación, simplemente que, en este momento, para pasar más tiempo con ella, conducir es la respuesta”.\nIlusionada de haber cumplido su sueño de ser mamá con Alaïa, enlistó las cualidades de su pequeña: “Tiene nueve añitos, se me ha crecido muchísimo, está casi más alta que yo, yo sé que eso no es difícil, pero está grande. Es una niña buena, cariñosa, noble, estoy que babeo con mi niña”. Reconoció que, tras su salida de Telemundo , sus seguidores le permitieron seguri cuidando a su hija: “Afortunadamente el público me ha dado el privilegio de poder estar cerca de ella, me siguen apoyando a mí, a mi familia y me siguen apoyando lo que estoy haciendo”.\n©@denochesinsueno MÁS NOTAS RELACIONADAS:\nAdamari López se sincera sobre las diferencias que tuvo con su exsuegra: ‘La debo haber hecho sentir mal’\nToni Costa muestra su entrañable baile padre e hija con Alaïa, ¡inspirado en Barbie!\nLa presentadora contó que con su salida de Hoy día hubo toda una reestructura en su vida y ahora ha encontrado, de nuevo el equilibrio: “Durante el día hago un programa de Youtube que sale cada semana, junto con Chiquibaby , Ada y Chiqui de Show , ahí contamos un poquito de nuestras historias de vida, cosas que nos han pasado, cuando salimos de una televisora, cuando tuvimos a nuestras niñas, de todo un poco, de las páginas que se pasaron, de las que no”, comentó haciendo referencia al podcast que estrenó con su amiga.\n©@denochesinsueno Un trabajo sin precedentes Adamari habló sobre su trabajo en ¿Quién caerá? , el programa con el que regresó a la televisión. En este proyecto, por primera vez, la conductora está al frente de una emisión de concursos, una situación poco habitual en la unión americana: “Estuve 11 años, ese ciclo se cerró y de repente me vuelven a abrir la oportunidad para seguirme probando como conductora, pero de un programa de concurso y sabes que acá, en los Estados Unidos, los programas de concursos se les dan a los hombres, no son característicos de las mujeres”, aseguró, resaltando el gran logro profesional que representa su estancia en este programa.\nVídeo Relacionado: Patrick Schwarzenegger rinde homenaje a Chance Perdomo Loading the player...

    "text": "The ceremony at the Sefine shipyard in Yalova was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, cabinet ministers, the leadership of the Turkish Armed Forces, and representatives from the Turkish defense industry companies. Speaking on the occasion of the ceremony, the Turkish President highlighted the importance of independence in the defense industry to have strong armed forces. “We have reached a localization rate of up to 80 percent in our projects. We not only carry out the construction and rough workmanship of the ships. We are also able to produce the sensors, payloads, weapons and ammunition needed in all ships built locally and domestically.” Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Türkiye President Erdogan also stated that in addition to developing and building UAVs and UCAVs, the Turkish defense industry will also focus on developing various combat platforms for the navy, from unmanned and autonomous naval vehicles to submarine platforms and aircraft carriers. The Turkish Defense Agency (SSB) mentioned the EW capabilities of the MARLIN USV on X (ex-Twitter) and emphasized that it is the first USV in the world to have comprehensive EW capabilities. Özgür Güleryüz, the CEO of [STM Engineering](https://www.stm.com.tr/en), the primary contractor for I-class frigates and logistics ships, explained that TCG İSTANBUL has taken its place among the five most modern frigates in the world. “The targeted localisation rate for the Istanbul Frigate was 75 percent, – a figure that we managed to increase to 80 percent through our efforts under the leadership of the SSB, and TCG İSTANBUL has thus taken the crown as the warship with the highest localisation rate in Türkiye.” Güleryüz said. “Our national frigate will serve as an important deterrent for our country in the world’s seas thanks to its national electronic warfare systems, which have a high localisation rate, its new generation national combat management system and its ability to launch air-guided projectiles.” Özgür Güleryüz, CEO of STM About I-class frigates, the first homegrown frigate of the Turkish Navy The I-class Frigate Program was launched to construct four frigates to replace aging YAVUZ-class Frigates of the Turkish Navy in the mid-2020s. Developed under the MILGEM indigenous warship program, the Istanbul class is an enlarged variant of the Ada-class anti-submarine corvette. The I-class Frigates will have around 50% increased fuel capacity and operational/sailing range capability compared to Ada-class Corvettes. The frigate was developed for anti-submarine and surface warfare, air warfare, reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, identification, detection and early warning. It is 113 meters long and has a beam of 14.4 meters. The TCG İSTANBUL was built at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard and equipped with advanced national solutions, including the ATMACA Anti-Ship Missile and MİDLAS Vertical Launch System (VLS) developed by Roketsan, the Gökdeniz Close-In Air Weapon System and Cenk-S AESA Radar developed by ASELSAN, and the ADVENT Combat Management System developed by HAVELSAN under the direction of Naval Forces Command. A total of 220 companies participated in the project, including 80 subcontractors working on the delivery of more than 150 systems. Works on the construction of the sixth, seventh and eighth MİLGEM I Class Platforms for the Turkish Navy, which will be sister ships to TCG İSTANBUL, Türkiye’s first national frigate, were launched in partnership with STM and TAİS in 2023.

DIMDEG’s main missions include replenishment at sea (RAS) for the Turkish Navy ships and have been designed for assistance tasks, such as humanitarian aid, search and rescue, non-combatant evacuation operation, as well as medical support. However, the vessel can serve as a command ship and support combat operations including naval air operations, defence against asymmetric threats, and support amphibious operations. Sefine is working with several Turkish companies including Aselsan for the [autonomous unmanned vehicles (AUV)](https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/dimdex-2022/2022/03/dimdex-2022-sefine-shipyard-unveiled-new-combat-usv/) that could be deployed from the ship, and which can be equipped with different payloads such as torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, rockets, jammers, etc. Aselsan is also responsible for many electronic systems of the ship, Havelsan and Turkish Lloyd are also part of the project. TCG Derya is fitted with GE LM2500 gas turbines that deliver more than 24 knots speed, which is above standards for an oiler. Here are some key specifications of the ship: - Length: 195 meters - Beam: 24.4 meters - Displacement: 26 000 tonnes - Max Speed: 24+ knots - Range: 4500 nautical miles - Crew: 162 - Weapons: 2xCIWS and 2x25mm gun (STOP) About MARLIN USV Turkish SEFİNE Shipyard and ASELSAN unveiled the brand-new MARLIN USV [in two NATO exercises in the second half of September 2022](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/09/dynamic-messenger-22-unmanned-systems-meet-manned-assets/), which marked Turkiye’s first participation to REPMUS NATO exercise with unmanned systems. According to SEFİNE and ASELSAN, the Marlin is one of the most capable USV to date, thanks to its size, payload, configuration adaptability, and especially its electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, which can be considered a “first” in the field. The payload of MARLIN during the NATO exercises were specifically for EW. The 15-meter ship will provide fleets with off-board jammers, which would be beneficial for surface warfare. MARLIN is an autonomous USV designed to meet the high speed, sea keeping and maneuverability requirements. The company didn’t share the dimensions and the endurance of the USV due to the confidentiality concerns, but available data suggests that the vessels optimal speed is 12 knots and it can exceed a top speed 36 knots. In addition, MARLIN is rather large, with a length of about 15 meters and a large payload capacity. MARLIN’s special hull form, propulsion system, and auxiliaries, allow it to operate up to Sea State 4 (and navigate in rough seas up to Sea State 5). It can be configured as an anti-surface warfare (ASUW) with guided missiles, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) with torpedoes. According to SEFINE, MARLIN can easily be fitted with different types of payloads (SSM, Torpedo, EW, Sonobuoy, SATCOM, LOS Communication, Underwater communication…) in order to meet operational needs with both monohull and trimaran hull forms as well as optimized for endurance figures. About Logistics Support Ship UTGM. ARİF EKMEKÇİ On February 9, 2021, a contract was signed between SSB and STM for the delivery of two logistics support vessels to the Turkish Navy. As the main contractor of the project, STM was assigned responsibility for the entire program management, procurement, assembly, ship outfitting, integration, testing and ILS activities. TCG YZB. GÜNGÖR DURMUŞ (A-574), the first ship of the logistics support project, was built at the ADA shipyard and ceremoniously handed over to the Turkish Naval Forces Command on December 8, 2021. TCG UTGM. ARİF EKMEKÇİ (A-575), the second ship of the project, set sail for the first time after a flag-raising ceremony on July 5, 2023 to begin its ship acceptance trials and was added to the inventory of the Turkish Naval Command after a ceremony on January 19, 2024. The ship measures 106.51 meters in length and has a width of 16.80 meters. The ship is operated by a crew of 82 and has an aft floating system and fleet replenishment capabilities. The ship can travel at a speed of 12+ knots and has a range of 9,500 nautical miles. It is equipped with two 12.7 mm ASELSAN STAMP weapon systems and a helipad that can accommodate a 15-ton supply helicopter. Its logistical capabilities are supported by a crane with a lifting capacity of 18 tons. It can transport eight containers, 631 tons of drinking water, 336 tons of JP-5 helicopter fuel and 4,036 tons of F-76 fuel.",

    "text": "If you like shrimp, you’re going to want to try this Typhoon Shelter Shrimp recipe. Crispy panko breadcrumbs are tossed in aromatic shrimp oil, along with fried ginger, garlic and chili. This mixture is then tossed with fragrant fried shrimp.\nWith that description alone, I don’t think I need to tell you how wonderful it smells and tastes!\nWhat is Typhoon Shelter Shrimp?\nIt is said that Typhoon Shelter Shrimp originated in\nHong Kong––Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay to be more specific.\nTyphoon season hits\nHong Kong from April to June every year. Causeway Bay was the largest typhoon shelter, or bifeng tang (避风塘) in HK back in the days, where merchants, peddlers, fishermen, and their boats converged during storms.\n“Typhoon shelter” has since become a style of cooking featuring a signature golden breadcrumb coating, which has been applied to all kinds of ingredients, from seafood and poultry to meats and vegetables like eggplant and mushrooms.\nSome of the more popular recipes include Typhoon Shelter Crab, Typhoon Shelter Wings, and of course, this Typhoon Shelter Shrimp.\nRecipe Tips Before You Start Cooking\nYou’ll be shocked as to how easy this recipe is. Just remember two things:\n- Don’t over-fry the shrimp, or they will dry out.\n- Keep the heat at medium to low when cooking the aromatics and panko, or they may burn.\nMy final tip: The shrimp oil that you’ll have leftover after making this dish is liquid gold in and of itself. It is extremely fragrant and flavorful, and can be used in dishes like\nPad Thai, Hong Kong Style Shrimp Chow Mein, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Shrimp Etouffee.\nDon’t waste that oil!\nTyphoon Shelter Shrimp Recipe: Instructions\nFirst, trim, de-vein and clean the shrimp as shown:\nShake off any excess water and pat them dry thoroughly with a paper towel.\nAdd the shrimp to a bowl and toss with ¼ teaspoon\nwhite pepper powder and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Set aside for 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.\nMince the\nginger and garlic. Chop scallions and chilies. Measure out your panko breadcrumbs.\nHeat 1 cup of oil in a\nwok to 300 degrees F. While the oil is heating, pat the shrimp again with a paper towel to ensure they’re dry. Any moisture will cause the hot oil to splatter.\nWhen the oil is at temperature, fry the shrimp in two separate batches (this prevents the temperature of oil from dropping too much), for about 15 seconds per batch.\nScoop them out and set aside.\nReheat the oil to ensure it’s back up to 300 degrees F. Re-fry each batch a second time, 5-10 seconds per batch.\nRemove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.\nTurn off the heat, and carefully scoop out some of the oil into a heatproof container, leaving about 1/3 cup oil in the wok. (You can use less oil, but you also need to reduce the panko accordingly.)\nAs you can see, the oil has changed color. It is incredibly flavorful, so save it for another recipe!\nWith the heat on medium low, add the ginger to the oil and cook for 30 seconds.\nThen add the garlic…\nAnd the chilies…\nFry for another 30 seconds before stirring in the panko.\nAdd in the shrimp, salt, sugar, the remaining ¼ teaspoon white pepper, 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine, and 1/8 teaspoon\nfive spice powder (if using). Also add the scallions.\nLightly toss everything together (still using medium low heat), and serve hot.\nTyphoon Shelter Shrimp\nIngredients\n- 1 pound large whole, head-on shrimp (450g)\n- 1/4 teaspoon\nwhite pepper powder(plus another ¼ teaspoon, divided)\n- 2 teaspoons\nShaoxing wine(divided)\n- 3 – 4 slices\nginger(minced, about 10g)\n- 7 cloves\ngarlic(minced)\n- 2\nhttps://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chives-scallions-aromatics-peppers/(chopped)\n- 3\nred chilies(chopped)\n- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs (70g)\n- 1 cup vegetable oil (or peanut oil)\n- 1/2 teaspoon\nsalt\n- 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n- 1/8 teaspoon\nfive spice powder(optional)\nInstructions\n- Trim, de-vein and clean the shrimp as shown in the step-by-step photos. Shake off any excess water and pat them dry thoroughly with a paper towel. Add the shrimp to a bowl and toss with ¼ teaspoon white pepper powder and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine.

    "text": "Nagui attaqué, le maestro Benoît évincé sur France 2 ?\nBenoît, le plus grand maestro de l’émission, s’est retrouvé une nouvelle fois en danger dans N’oubliez pas les paroles sur France 2, ce mercredi 29 janvier 2025. Côté audience, le succès est-il toujours au rendez-vous pour le jeu animé par Nagui ?\nBenoît était de retour pour une nouvelle participation dans N’oubliez pas les paroles sur France 2, ce mercredi 29 janvier 2025. Dans le premier numéro du jeu animé par Nagui, il était opposé à Mike. À l’issue de la première manche, le maestro s’est retrouvé en danger en étant mené sur le score de 40 à 30.\nAinsi, pour la huitième fois depuis le début de son parcours et pour la troisième fois en une semaine, Benoît se retrouve dans le fauteuil et risque l’élimination. Lors de la « même chanson », sur « En attendant ses pas » de Céline Dion, Mike trouve quelques mots, mais laisse l’opportunité au plus grand maestro du jeu de conserver son micro d’argent.\nN’oubliez pas les paroles : Le maestro Benoît prêt à atteindre les 100 victoires ?\nComme la veille, où il était en grand danger en étant mené 311 à 0, Benoît rattrape son retard. Il remporte son duel sur le score de 53 à 43. En finale, sur « Si j’avais su t’aimer » de Chimène Badi, le maestro remporte 1 000 euros.\nDans le second numéro de N’oubliez pas les paroles , Benoît affrontait Florence. À l’issue de la première manche, le maestro mène 80 à 20. Lors de la « même chanson », sur « Mexico » de Luis Mariano, il se montre rattrapable. Mais Florence ne trouve pas le moindre mot. En finale, sur « Pour elle » de SDM, il ne remporte pas d’argent. La cagnotte de Benoît s’élève à 650 000 euros en 98 victoires.\nAudience en forte hausse pour Nagui, mais…\nLes deux numéros de N’oubliez pas les paroles , proposés entre 18h40 et 19h48, ont respectivement réuni 2,80 et 3,43 millions de téléspectateurs, soit 19,1% et 20% de part de marché sur les quatre ans et plus. Grâce aux performances du maestro Benoît, France 2 se classe leader des audiences. Sur un an, le jeu animé par Nagui est en forte progression avec une hausse respective de 5,4 et 3,7 points de part d’audience.\nEn revanche, sur la cible commerciale, les deux éditions de N’oubliez pas les paroles ont respectivement séduit 11,8% et 14,6% des femmes responsables des achats de moins de 50 ans. Sur cette cible, France 2 se classe deuxième des audiences. De ce fait, Nagui, qui a récemment été chamboulé, se retrouve attaqué en termes d’audience auprès de cette cible prioritaire.\nBenoît tentera de conserver son micro d’argent ce jeudi 30 janvier 2025 dès 18h40 dans N’oubliez pas les paroles sur France 2. S’il parvient à gagner les deux émissions, il atteindra alors le cap symbolique des 100 victoires.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Bristol County, Massachusetts from 1901-2000 was 31.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Bristol County, Massachusetts experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Bristol County, Massachusetts history.",

    "title": "AFN, Ottawa finalize 10-year, $47.8-billion deal on child welfare reform",
    "text": "MONTREAL - The Assembly of First Nations finalized a deal with Ottawa late Wednesday night that will see the federal government spend $47.8 billion to reform child welfare programs over the next 10 years. AFN National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak made the announcement on the final day of the AFN’s annual general assembly in Montreal, just two days after she told chiefs there was an offer on the table but that she could not yet discuss it publicly. While her announcement was met with cheers, there remained concerns Thursday among some who accused her and the AFN of working in secrecy to finalize a deal that will affect their children for generations to come. The agreement seeks to redress decades of discrimination against First Nations children, who were torn from their families and placed in foster care because the child welfare systems on reserves were not funded to provide services that could keep families together. “There has been so much pain and hurt and harm caused by this racist child-welfare policy in every one of our First Nations communities and our families,” Woodhouse Nepinak said at a press conference following her announcement. Notably absent during that news conference was Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, who helped bring forward the human rights complaint that lead to the settlement. “The Caring Society does not have a copy of the agreement nor do we know what is in it — most importantly many Chiefs and their service providers don’t have it either,” Blackstock said on X, formerly Twitter. “Once we receive a copy we will do our due diligence to ensure it stops Canada’s discrimination now and beyond.” The federal government is responsible for child welfare on reserves, and provincial governments for child welfare programs everywhere else. But Ottawa’s funding was only on par with the provinces when it came to foster care because they had to pay provincial agencies to provide that service at provincial rates. The AFN is set to ratify the agreement at a special assembly in September should chiefs agree to its contents. Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu shed a few tears as Woodhouse Nepinak discussed the monumental agreement they had reached. “It’s an attempt to bring some peace to families and to communities and to First Nations peoples who have experienced the tool of colonialism through what I would say is the most cruel policy, which is to separate families,” she said. Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict said the agreement marks a fundamental change in the relationship between First Nations and Ottawa. “I can tell you that as part of the negotiating team, we are comfortable with the agreement that we have seen. Otherwise, we would have not put it forward,” he said, thanking Hajdu for her support. “This is revolutionary.” He added that First Nations people will now begin the process of discussing the deal on its merits. “It is now in the hands of our communities.” The deal is worth more than double what was originally promised for long-term reform in a settlement agreement that resulted from a hard-fought human-rights complaint over underfunding of child-welfare services. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled Canada had discriminated against First Nations children due to the chronic underfunding of child welfare programs. The initial amount was slated at $20 billion. A separate $23 billion was set aside to compensate children and families harmed by the system. Families who helped launched the initial court case stood with the minister and national chief as they shared the news. The process to reach the landmark deal was marred by concerns from chiefs across the country, with child welfare dominating sideline conversations, last-minute resolutions and closed-door meetings despite it being mostly left off the original agenda. Four regional chiefs who sit alongside Woodhouse Nepinak on the assembly’s executive committee penned letters to her in June decrying its efforts to reach a deal, saying it was overstepping its mandate by making decisions that will directly affect First Nations children and families without consent. Chiefs Bobby Cameron, Terry Teegee, Ghislain Picard and Joanna Bernard represent more than half of First Nations in Canada. They also accused the AFN of attempting to sideline the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society from the process, despite them jointly launching a human-rights complaint about Ottawa’s underfunding of on-reserve child welfare services. Woodhouse Nepinak denied that, and said chiefs would be able to see the agreement before it’s voted on during a special chiefs assembly in the fall. Woodhouse Nepinak promised Thursday to listen to the feedback she is getting. “You have directed us to go and get a deal out of Canada. You’ve pushed us over and over again to continue to negotiate in a good way,” she told chiefs. “I get direction from you. Not from agencies, not from AFN, not from staff, not from anybody else, but from chiefs.” She did reveal the dollar figure in a closed-door meeting with chiefs and their proxies on Tuesday. During that meeting, she talked about the political risks of not accepting the deal that is on the table, according to a source who was in the room but was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to share the details publicly. That risk referred to the fact a federal election is on the horizon and a new government led by the Conservatives is a distinct possibility. On Thursday, when asked what will happen should there be a change in government next year, Hajdu said there is a fiscal commitment that the next government, “in theory,” will not be able to cut. Asked whether the announcement was made political as it came on the same day Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attended the assembly for the first time in person, Hajdu said they “didn’t choose this specific date.” Child welfare advocate Mary Teegee said that while it is a landmark settlement, the process that led to it was “disappointing to say the least.” “The chiefs ought to know what’s been going on. They need to know what is in that final settlement agreement, and they need to know what was happening.” By the end of the day Thursday, some chiefs told The Canadian Press they had yet to receive a copy and were told it could be at least a couple of days before they do. As Woodhouse Nepinak was leaving the room where the news conference was occurring, Teegee confronted her about the assembly’s handling of the file. “I think there was disrespect shown to me as a proxy and as a hereditary chief to not see the final agreement before announcing this,” Teegee told her. “I think all the chiefs in assembly should have seen it before there was any announcement,” Teegee told Woodhouse Nepinak. She called for Woodhouse Nepinak to support chiefs in their calls for the AFN and other involved parties to listen to their input and change course if need be before the final settlement agreement is finalized. Woodhouse Nepinak, who had been attempting to leave the area before Teegee spoke to her, responded “OK.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024.

    "text": "A new art exhibit at La Nube is highlighting the importance of wildlife conservation efforts while also previewing a new statewide initiative that will bring desert bighorn sheep to the Borderland. \"Ram-arkable Resilience: Art meets Conservation\" recently opened at La Nube, and with it a challenge to confront the impact Borderland residents have on the local environment, as well as how they can support wildlife conservation movements. The work is a collaborative effort by Green Hope Project, La Nube STEAM Discovery Center, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), Socorro ISD and Ysleta ISD. As its name suggests, \"Ram-arkable Resilience\" riffs on the theme of rams -- or desert bighorn sheep -- that are made entirely out of recycled trash, including cardboard boxes, water bottles, newspaper, plastic forks and damaged fabric from one of La Nube's exhibits. The result is a stylized depiction of El Paso's Franklin Mountains, peppered with desert bighorn sheep traversing the peaks and valleys; a \"vision\" that the creators said \"may not be too far in the future.\" That's because later this year, TPWD plans to relocate some of the state's desert bighorn sheep from the Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area to Franklin Mountains State Park, in a bid to protect existing herds. RECOMMENDED: Experience the power of Italian opera in El Paso this October “We are excited to partner with the Green Hope Project. This initiative aligns with La Nube’s mission to ignite imagination and inspire guests to discover, create, and innovate by engaging the community in creative environmental stewardship through art and education,” said Norma Escandon, Early Childhood Coordinator for La Nube. “By highlighting the importance of preserving native wildlife, La Nube empowers visitors to become visionary thinkers and responsible changemakers for the natural world.” \"Ram-arkable Resilience: Art meets Conservation\" was created by students and art instructors from Parkland High School, Del Valle High School and Vista Del Sol Environmental Science Academy, as well as during La Nube workshops for children. The exhibition will be on display near La Nube's entrance until Nov. 2.
