    "title": "Boeing’s workers in Seattle walk out in first since 2008",
    "text": "Boeing Co factory workers early yesterday walked off the job for the first time in 16 years, crippling manufacturing across its Seattle commercial jet hub after members of its largest union rejected a contract offer and voted to strike.\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents 33,000 Boeing employees across the US west coast, on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to strike in Seattle, with 94.6 percent voting to reject the offer and 96 percent supporting a strike. They downed tools officially at midnight local time.\nWhile both parties have expressed a desire to get back to the bargaining table sooner rather than later, the move adds to the strain on Boeing. The company was already reeling from the fallout over quality lapses after a near-catastrophe at the start of this year that spurred investigations, a customer revolt and an executive shake-up.\nPhoto: Scott Brauer, Bloomberg\n“This has been a long time coming, our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” IAM District 751 president Jon Holden said to a packed hall of union members and media. “Clearly there were aspects of this agreement that weren’t good enough.”\nBy the time he finished speaking, the chants of “strike, strike” were deafening.\nBoeing builds 737 Max jetliners at its Renton factory on the outskirts of Seattle, and makes 777 and 767 models at its Everett facility to the city’s north.\nBoeing’s offer did not compensate for 16 years of stagnant wages, higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs and the relocation of thousands of union jobs, Holden said.\n“There’s a lot at stake here for our members, so I am proud of them,” he said. “And we’re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can.”\nBoeing said in a statement that it remains “committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”\nBy striking, members ignored a plea for peace by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has vowed to reset labor relations. They also bucked the recommendation of their own union leaders that they accept terms that included a 25 percent guaranteed wage increase over four years. While that was the largest such pay hike ever offered by the planemaker, workers had expected a far greater increase. They were also angered that the terms eliminated an annual bonus.\nBoeing has been in a financially difficult situation since a Jan. 5 accident exposed deficiencies at its factories and forced the planemaker to reduce production. The company has been bleeding cash as a result, and its credit rating is hovering one step above speculative grade, putting the planemaker in a difficult position as it contends with a heavy debt load of US$45 billion.\nThe defeat at the hand of workers means that Boeing and IAM District 751 would need to head back to the negotiating table to try and find terms that satisfy members of a union with a long history of activism.\nTD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr has estimated a 50-day walkout, in line with previous strikes, clipping between US$3 billion and US$3.5 billion from Boeing’s cash flow.\nNapoleon Osorio is proud of being the first taxi driver to have accepted payment in bitcoin in the first country in the world to make the cryptocurrency legal tender: El Salvador. He credits Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s decision to bank on bitcoin three years ago with changing his life. “Before I was unemployed... And now I have my own business,” said the 39-year-old businessman, who uses an app to charge for rides in bitcoin and now runs his own car rental company. Three years ago the leader of the Central American nation took a huge gamble when he put bitcoin\nTECH RACE: The Chinese firm showed off its new Mate XT hours after the latest iPhone launch, but its price tag and limited supply could be drawbacks China’s Huawei Technologies Co (華為) yesterday unveiled the world’s first tri-foldable phone, as it seeks to expand its lead in the world’s biggest smartphone market and steal the spotlight from Apple Inc hours after it debuted a new iPhone. The Chinese tech giant showed off its new Mate XT, which users can fold three ways like an accordion screen door, during a launch ceremony in Shenzhen. The Mate XT comes in red and black and has a 10.2-inch display screen. At 3.6mm thick, it is the world’s slimmest foldable smartphone, Huawei said.

SiC chips offer higher efficiency and lower energy loss than pure silicon chips, and they are able to operate at higher temperatures. They have become crucial to the development of electric vehicles, artificial intelligence data centers, green energy storage and industrial devices. Vanguard, a contract chipmaker focused on making power management chips and driver ICs for displays, is to acquire a 13 percent stake in Episil for NT$2.48 billion (US$77.1 million).\nCROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: The US company could switch orders from TSMC to alternative suppliers, but that would lower chip quality, CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang (黃仁勳), whose products have become the hottest commodity in the technology world, on Wednesday said that the scramble for a limited amount of supply has frustrated some customers and raised tensions. “The demand on it is so great, and everyone wants to be first and everyone wants to be most,” he told the audience at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc technology conference in San Francisco. “We probably have more emotional customers today. Deservedly so. It’s tense. We’re trying to do the best we can.” Huang’s company is experiencing strong demand for its latest generation of chips, called",

    "title": "Grassy, Tropical and Fresh, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc Is Instantly Recognizable",
    "text": "It’s the wine on a restaurant list or shop shelf that is a sure bet at an affordable price.\nNew Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is one of wine’s greatest success stories. Having shot to popularity in the last decades of the 20th century, it has since been enjoying the kind of success that makes other wine-producing nations watch with envy.\nMuch of its crowd-appeal is due to the style’s consistency and instant recognizability. The pungent pop of lime, passionfruit, fresh bell pepper and grass aromas that precede a palate of zingy acidity , bright fruit and whisper of sweetness is, for many, a fridge staple.\nThese aromatic wines are downright explosive to the senses.\nThis especially true when compared to the more tempered, bone-dry French Sauvignon Blancs, like those from Sancerre , where the variety grows on the inland Loire Valley ’s chalk, limestone-gravel and “silex” (flint) soils or from the gravel and quartz-laced soils of Pessac-Léognan , in Bordeaux, where it’s often blended with Semillon and other local varieties and aged in oak for a richer, creamier style.\nUnlike the aforementioned regions, Aotearoa-New Zealand “Savvy B” vines are never far from the ocean. Those cool sea breezes and big diurnal temperatures, combined with a wide variety of free-draining soils, contribute to bold aromatics that cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world.\nA whopping 77% of all of the island nation’s wines are made from this variety—which is grown all across the country.\nIn the northern Hawke’s Bay region, where the climate is warmer, Sauvignon Blanc tends towards the tropical end of the spectrum. Down on the southern end of the North Island, in Wairarapa, the aromatics veer more vegetal.\nAround Nelson, at the top of the South Island, the varietal strikes a balance between the two.\nBut it’s Marlborough , located in the South Island’s northeast corner, that grows the lion’s share of Sauvignon Blanc with nearly 59,000 acres planted out of the nation’s 65,628 acres.\nThe coastal region is protected by mountains in the north, south and west, making it low on rainfall and humidity and high on sunshine. Soils vary from alluvial with “greywacke” (large river stones), to clay and wind-blown loess.\n“The cool ocean surrounding our small islands provides a moderating influence on temperature,” says Jules Taylor, founder of the winery of the same name, who has decades of winemaking experience in Marlborough. “Combine this with our small land mass that never builds heat over the summer like the bigger continental locations, and you get a perfect situation that allows us to grow fruit that retains a vibrant acidity and highly aromatic flavor profile.”\nRecent years have ushered in an age of experimentation in Marlborough. The region’s quality-driven producers are using winemaking techniques like wild ferments, lees and skin contact as well as barrel aging, which add entirely new flavor and textural dimensions to Sauvignon Blanc.\nAs these forward-thinking winemakers gain better understanding of their sites, they’ve sharpened Marlborough’s regional and subregional differences . This helps them champion and defend their unique patch of land from the increasing number of wines made by multinational companies who buy juice in bulk and bottle overseas to capitalize on the fame of the Marlborough name.\nBy buying from small-batch grower-winemakers and those with the Appellation Marlborough Wine (AMW) certification of authenticity logo on the back label, consumers can help support these smaller producers while ensuring they’re getting top quality bottles.\nOr you can follow this guide. Below we’re rounded up 11 of the most highly rated New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs from producers we know and love.\nBest Splurge Clos Henri 2020 Clay Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\nA special cuvée launched in honor of this top biodynamic winery’s 20-year anniversary, Clay is, as the name suggests, from vines with feet in the estate’s Broadbridge clay soils. Native yeast, lees and old Austrian oak barrels all contribute to this pristine wine, which is round, elegant and poised. With aeration, it opens to a multifaceted nose of tangerine, white peach, orchard blossom and grass, shaded in salted cream. The palate is full-figured, with depth and weight but also freshness, length, a saline spine and a gorgeous chalky texture. There’s a level of complexity here rarely seen in Marlborough that, frankly, raises the bar for the whole region.

Best Buy. 90 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Wine.com Seifried 2022 Old Coach Road Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson)\nFrom the small but mighty Nelson region at the top of the South Island, this is richly aromatic with ripe, borderline confected, notes of passion fruit, lime peel and honey. The palate is where it really shines. Green-tinged lemony flavors are wrapped in a lovely slippery mouthfeel and vibrant acidity. There’s length and food-friendliness. Best Buy. 89 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Arrowine & Cheese Best No Sulfites Added (NSA) Loveblock 2022 Tee Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\nThe second vintage of this experimental wine from Kim and Erica Crawford, which supplements green-tea tannin extract for sulfur, is as delicious and outside the box as the first. A pale-gold hue, it’s rich and honeyed with up-front notes of butterscotch, grilled pineapple, fresh wild herbs and, yes, green tea, although it’s less prominent this vintage. The palate is dry—more than the nose might suggest. It’s textural and weightier than your typical Marlborough SB. There’s a lovely crunch of tangy acidity and a skinsy grip to the finish. 93 Points — C.P.\n$34 Total Wine & More Best Awatare Valley Astrolabe 2023 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley)\nA riot of subregionally typical characters bursts from the glass, from green grass and jalapeño pepper to passion fruit and lime. The palate is light and bright with gently slippery texture and that balance of green veg and fresh fruit to the long, prickly finish. 91 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Wine.com Best Central Otago Rippon 2020 Lake Wanaka Sauvignon Blanc (Central Otago)\nRippon’s Sauvignon, from its breathtaking biodynamic vineyards on Lake Wanaka, isn’t a crowd-pleaser. Instead it demands your focus—and perhaps well-paired spring or summer cuisine. Wild fermented partially in oak barrels, it has a pungency that’s reminiscent of dandelions, wet hay, scrubby local herbs and grasses, along with green tea, lemongrass and green apples. It’s the palate that really hooks you. Highly textural, it’s slinky, with vibrant acidity. Focused and confident, this could morph into another being altogether in five to seven years. 92 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Wine.com Best Martinborough Craggy Range 2023 Te Muna Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)\nVibrant lime and tropical fruit are in the lead on this aromatic Sauvignon Blanc, with some subtle jalapeño pepper and herbal nuances tucked beneath. The palate offers lovely textural appeal that tempers the citrusy crunch of acidity. There’s nice fruit concentration to the long finish. 92 Points — C.P.\n$25 Wine.com Best Marlborough Greywacke 2021 Wild Sauvignon (Marlborough) Typically reductive and a little funky in style, the 2021 Wild strikes a fine balance with the fruit. Sure, the sulfuric struck match and salted nut characters are prominent, but they’re tempered by more varietal notes of passion fruit and lime. There’s lovely texture to the palate, with zippy acidity and a salted citrus finish. 93 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Total Wine & More Best Marlborough Organic Hans Family Estate 2020 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough) With a light straw color, there’s an opulence here but an effortlessness, too, as though the ginger, honey, lemon curd and grilled peach cobbler notes are just along for the ride. The palate is richer still, with a build of creamy texture, but it retains freshness and heaps of appealing fruit, spice and dairy flavors. Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, but not as you know it. 93 Points — C.P.\n$40 Wine-searcher Dog Point 2021 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\nLike two flint rocks striking one another, there’s a smoky, sulfuric aroma that mingles with toasted nut and oyster shell. More delicate fruit (pithy lime) and floral aromas arrive after some time in glass. There’s a textural richness to the palate. It’s sliced by razor-edged acidity. Crunchy and citrusy with length and poise, this manages to be delicate and bold all at once. It’s a divisive style but one that enormously rewards time and food. 91 Points — C.P.\n$ Varies Woodland Hills Wine Company",

(PHOTO / XINHUA) FUZHOU - China has announced concrete measures in six areas to enhance support for the [private economy](https://www.chinadailyhk.com//article/343472), following previous measures rolled out in 2023 that saw private enterprises register high trade and investment growth. Zheng Shanjie, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said on Tuesday that more pragmatic measures will be taken in six areas. He made the statement at a themed conference on the private economy's high-quality development, held in Jinjiang, east China's Fujian province. ALSO READ: [Measures for bigger, better, stronger private sector](https://www.chinadailyhk.com//article/341955) The six areas are as follows: accelerating the legislative process of the law on the promotion of the private economy; improving multi-level communications and exchanges and listening to the real voices of private enterprises; strengthening the analysis of the private economy's development; attracting more private capital to participate in major national engineering projects, such as railways and nuclear power, as well as in others covering energy, water facilities, and ecological and environmental protection; promulgating good practices and cases for mutual learning; and improving work mechanisms with a view to better serving the private economy's development. A series of policies to promote the development of the private economy was introduced in 2023. \"With the implementation of these policies and measures, the development of the private economy has shown a general trend of steady progress and steady improvement,\" Zheng said.

    "text": "La Chimera di Arezzo tornerà periodicamente in esposizione in città grazie a un ciclo espositivo cadenzato nel tempo. L’obiettivo è creare un appuntamento ricorrente che rafforzi il legame tra il patrimonio storico-artistico e la comunità locale . Ad annunciarlo sono i consiglieri regionali Marco Casucci (Noi Moderati) e Gabriele Veneri (Fratelli d’Italia), dopo l’approvazione della loro mozione in commissione Cultura del Consiglio regionale, che ha accolto anche un emendamento del Pd.\nSecondo i promotori, questa iniziativa favorirà una sinergia tra Comune di Arezzo, diverse fondazioni culturali e musei, oltre al Ministero della cultura, creando un modello virtuoso di collaborazione per la tutela e la valorizzazione del patrimonio storico e artistico. La presenza della Chimera durante la mostra \"Vasari. Il Teatro delle Virtù\" ha già dimostrato come l’opera contribuisca a rafforzare il legame tra il patrimonio etrusco e l’identità culturale contemporanea, promuovendo la conoscenza storica e il turismo culturale nel territorio. \"Sono orgoglioso per l’approvazione di un atto così importante per Arezzo – dichiara Casucci –. La Chimera è un simbolo identitario della città, rappresenta l’eccellenza artigianale e il patrimonio storico della nostra regione\". Veneri sottolinea come la Chimera incarni la tradizione artigiana dell’oreficeria tramandata dagli Etruschi, auspicando che la sua esposizione ispiri i giovani ad apprendere questi mestieri, motivo di orgoglio per il territorio. Il nuovo ciclo espositivo sarà dunque un’occasione per rendere omaggio a questo capolavoro etrusco e per continuare a costruire un ponte tra passato e presente, promuovendo la cultura come elemento fondante dell’identità e dello sviluppo del territorio.\nGaia Papi",

    "text": "高雄前金區一帶於7月3日凌晨2點多發生無預警停電事件，影響586戶居民的正常生活。當晚氣溫偏高，許多住戶因無法使用冷氣及電風扇而被熱醒，紛紛走到街上尋求涼爽。初步調查顯示，停電疑似由工地半夜違規施工時不慎挖斷地下電纜所導致。此事件不僅造成居民不便，也引發了對夏季高溫環境下停電可能導致健康問題的關注。\n 凌晨2點多，高雄前金區多棟大樓陷入一片黑暗，許多無法入睡的住戶紛紛走到街頭尋求解決方法。一位住戶表示，原本打算洗澡後就寢，卻因突然停電而無法繼續睡覺。有些居民想到超商吹冷氣降溫，但發現超商同樣停電。有住戶即使已穿著背心，仍熱到需不停用手帕擦汗。\n停電期間還發生了一個小插曲。一位住戶說明，由於整個地區都停電，大樓的緊急發電機啟動運作，柴油發電過程中冒出煙霧，嚇得一些住戶誤以為發生火警。所幸警方到場後確認只是虛驚一場，但住戶們仍因半夜沒有冷氣和電風扇而感到不適。\n 台電人員迅速趕到現場進行搶修工作。當被問及停電原因時，台電人員表示可能與附近的工地施工有關，因為當時只有該工地在進行作業。根據了解，這些工程原本應在晚上10點前結束，但工程卻在未經許可的情況下繼續進行。高雄前金區一帶於7月3日凌晨2點13分開始停電，共影響586戶，直到半小時後才全數復電。初步判斷，停電疑似是工程施工不慎挖斷電纜所致。\n一位住戶抱怨道，天氣非常炎熱，晚上沒有電、沒有冷氣真的很難入睡，全身都在流汗根本無法休息。許多居民只能拿起扇子不停搧風降溫。幸好停電時間不到一小時就恢復供電，否則居民不只無法睡覺，還可能面臨中暑的風險。\n對於高溫環境下睡覺是否可能導致中暑的問題，一位醫師解釋，在睡眠期間人體散熱能力會減慢，更容易在體內堆積熱量。如果流汗過多又沒有適當補充水分，會增加熱衰竭的可能性。\n許多民眾為了節省電費，會將冷氣設定定時關閉。然而，為了省錢而在高溫環境下睡覺，若導致中暑需要就醫，其花費可能更加驚人.",
