    "text": "“L’Ucraina voleva davvero catturare Kursk”: il comandante Akhmat, in un’intervista al comandante militare Sladkov, ha parlato dei piani dei nazionalisti dopo l’invasione del territorio russo Il giornalista militare russo Alexander Sladkov ha pubblicato nel suo [canale telegramma](https://it.topwar.ru/index.php?do=go&url=aHR0cHM6Ly90Lm1lL1NsYWRrb3ZfcGx1cy8xMTIyNg%3D%3D)intervista al comandante delle forze speciali Akhmat, Apty Alaudinov. In una conversazione per strada, il generale russo ha detto cosa intendevano fare i militanti del regime di Kiev subito dopo l'invasione del territorio della regione di Kursk della Federazione Russa. Secondo lui i nazionalisti avevano intenzione di impadronirsi della centrale nucleare di Kursk a Kurchatov, ma sono stati fermati in tempo dall'esercito russo. – ha detto Apty Alaudinov. Ha aggiunto che ad un certo punto il comando del gruppo rivoluzionario delle forze armate ucraine ha ritardato la decisione di avanzare più in profondità nella regione di Kursk. E più tardi l'esercito russo gli ha impedito di farlo. [esercito](https://it.topwar.ru/armament/russian_army/) - ha osservato il capo militare. Secondo il generale, nell'operazione Kursk, i militanti del regime di Kiev hanno utilizzato un'enorme quantità di attrezzature in un'area ristretta. – ha sottolineato il comandante di “Akhmat”. Apty Alaudinov, commentando la situazione attuale del gruppo ucraino nella regione di Kursk, ha osservato che i nazionalisti si trovano ora in una situazione molto difficile. Secondo le intercettazioni radio, i militanti ordinari chiedono al comando di ritirarli dalla regione di confine della Federazione Russa. - Alaudinov ha citato un dialogo tra i soldati ucraini e il comando, intercettato dai soldati Akhmat. Egli ha osservato che il comando militare ucraino attualmente non solo non è in grado di trasferire rinforzi nella regione di Kursk, ma incontra anche serie difficoltà nell'evacuazione dei feriti, di cui ce ne sono molti nel gruppo rivoluzionario. – ha riassunto Alaudinov. Mi piacerebbe credere che questo contraccolpo sia una realtà e, nella versione ideale, il contraccolpo dovrebbe comunque trasformarsi nella completa distruzione del nemico.",

    "title": "The Must-Have Product That Makes Cleaning The House A Breeze",
    "text": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nLet's be real: No one looks forward to chore day. Most people want a clean house, but they also want to get through the task of tidying it as quickly and efficiently as possible. That not only means knowing all the best cleaning hacks that cut your scrubbing time in half, but also having all of your cleaning tools and supplies an arm's reach away. Having them handy cuts down on the time you have to run to and from your cleaning cupboard or closet, saving you time and energy. And one great way to have these items near you at all times is to wear a cleaning apron.\nA cleaning apron is exactly as it sounds: It's an apron that ties around your waist and is outfitted with a series of practical pockets. These pockets vary in shape, size, and purpose. Some are big enough to house spray bottles, others have loops so you can hang tools like Swiffer Dusters from them, and others are compact so you can pocket things like sponges or cell phones. Here is why you should try out this cleaning accessory to make chore day all the more convenient.\nWhy you should try a cleaning apron\nAmazon\nThe cleaning apron is essentially like a cleaning cart, except it's strapped to your person. Lots of people like to use the rolling cart hack to make their chores easier to perform, where they pack a rolling cart full of their cleaning essentials and wheel it from room to room. This negates the need to run to your cupboard every time you need a different cleaning spray or vacuum attachment. However, while convenient, it's not a great option if you have multiple floors to clean, since that would require you to carry a heavy cart up and down stairs. The cleaning apron helps to fix that.\nThe apron can also be comparable to a handheld cleaning caddy , which is a small bucket with compartments that can hold a couple of different cleaning products, sponges, and small tools you may need. While that's much easier to carry up and down the stairs, it's not glued to you like the apron, which means you still need to walk back and forth to get what you need. For ultimate convenience, use the apron to grab what you require the second you need it. Curious? Here is where to buy one.\nCleaning apron options\nWalmart\nYou can get a cleaning apron at major realtors such as Amazon and Walmart. For example, on Amazon , you can try out the LoDrid Professional Cleaning Apron for $20. It's made from water-resistant nylon, so it won't stain or saturate if some cleaning spray leaks onto it, and it has nine different pockets to house your supplies and tools. You can fit anything from garbage bags to rubber gloves in those pockets. Similarly, there is a comparable cleaning apron at Walmart . Dubbed the MLfire 600D Oxford Cloth Cleaning Apron, it retails for an affordable $12, is made from a water-resistant material, and has two rows of pockets that can hold cleaning essentials.\nWhile there are a lot of pros to this cleaning helper, there are also a few downsides that you should consider. First, it might get annoying having bulky bottles and cans hang off of you if you're trying to clean the tub or handwash the floor. That's because they can get in your way or potentially fall out when bent over. You might have to remove the apron to do those tasks. Secondly, you can't hang every possible cleaning product and tool you might need in those pockets, so you might have to venture back to your cupboard to swap out your supplies. While it might not tick every convenience you might need, it can still help you make fast work of your chores. It all depends on your own preferences and how you clean!",

    "title": "Medical Malpractice Harms All Parties Involved, Documentary Reveals | MedPage Today",
    "text": "Nobody wins with the current medical malpractice system in the U.S.\nThat's the thesis of a new documentary -- produced by a physician and directed by two medical students -- that aired on PBS Rhode Island this summer.\nIt's called \" A World of Hurt: How Medical Malpractice Fails Everyone \" and it examines three medical malpractice cases with very different outcomes, illustrating just how difficult the system can be for all parties involved.\n\"It's a problem for doctors ... but the system is not fair to patients either. Medical malpractice fails everyone,\" said Mark Brady, MD, MPH, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who served as executive producer on the documentary.\nOne of the three cases is that of the late Matthew Seaman, MD, an emergency medicine physician in Washington state who died by suicide while a medical malpractice case was pending against him.\nHis wife, Linda Seaman, MD, said her husband came home late in the afternoon after his deposition -- parts of which are included in the documentary -- saying he felt \"worthless.\"\nThe next morning, Linda discovered that her husband had hung himself.\n\"He felt rejected, ashamed, humiliated, you name it, but he didn't know how else to feel better, so it's like he just gave up,\" she said.\nSeaman isn't the only physician whose struggle is detailed in the film. The story of Gita Pensa, MD, also an emergency medicine physician at Brown, is woven through the three cases to share further insights.\nPensa spent 12 years fighting a medical malpractice lawsuit that she ultimately won, but she said she felt completely unprepared for the experience.\n\"Everybody talks about how to prevent a lawsuit, but no one ever said anything about, when you're sued, this is what you do,\" Pensa told MedPage Today . \"I was in a bad place for a long time. I was miserable at home, I was miserable at work.\"\nHer case went to trial in 2011 and she won, but the verdict was overturned in 2015 during an appeal. Pensa worked hard to prepare for her second trial in 2018.\n\"By the time I went to trial a second time, I was a totally different person,\" she said. \"I was a consummate witness, I invited my residents to come watch me testify in court so they could learn. I considered myself expert at it.\"\nShe won that trial and there were no more appeals, she said.\nEven patients who win their cases describe the experience as harrowing. The documentary opens with the case of Megan Barrett, who died from a stroke because of a \"clear miss\" by a radiologist.\nIn his deposition, the exasperated radiologist says, \"I missed it. Hundred percent I missed it. ... It's caused me tremendous pain. I lost a lot of sleep over it.\"\nBarrett's sister, Amanda Grieshop, led her medical malpractice case, saying it was one of the most difficult experiences of her life.\n\"This lawsuit was exceptionally emotionally draining. I was not as available to my family. It was a full-time job for me for 3 years and I was on multiple antidepressants for multiple years during the process,\" Grieshop said in the documentary. \"It was by far the most stressful thing I've ever gone through in my life.\"\nBrady, who has produced two other documentaries -- one on the history of emergency medicine that also aired on PBS , and one on pediatric palliative care that aired on the New York Times Op-Docs -- said the documentary is more descriptive than prescriptive. However, the third case is about a family that used a communication and resolution program (CRP) to air their grievances about their daughter's death.\nCRPs are seen as alternatives to medical malpractice litigation, but not all health systems have them, and they're not always administered consistently across health systems, Brady said. Nonetheless, it worked for the case explored in the documentary.\n\"Their emotional state seemed to be a lot better than the first person, who had to go through a very contentious, adversarial system,\" Brady told MedPage Today . \"It's horrible when bad things happen, but it's less horrible when you're not fighting against a very adversarial system.\"\nBrady said he hopes the film, in part, shows doctors that they're not alone if they get sued for malpractice.\n\"If you're in medicine, there's a very good chance you're going to be sued at some point,\" he said. \"It's not a reflection on you, it's a reflection of the system.\"\nPensa now coaches other physicians involved in medical malpractice cases. She also hosts a podcast called \" Doctors and Litigation: The L Word \" and runs a medical malpractice preparedness course through a large insurer in the Northeast called the Litigation Education and Performance (LEAP) program.\n\"It fills a gap, but we still have a tremendous gap around this,\" Pensa said. \"It remains a taboo topic in medicine and I think that helps perpetuate the shame around it.\"\nViknesh Kasthuri, one of the two medical school students, along with Alexander Homer, who directed the film, agreed that the stigma needs to be erased. He's heard from administrators that one reason they don't want to include litigation preparedness in medical school curriculum is that \"we don't want to scare anyone.\"\n\"There are no other issues in healthcare where we take this approach,\" Kasthuri told MedPage Today . \"We don't say, strokes are super-scary, we're not going to teach them.\"\nKasthuri and Homer spent 3 years working on the documentary, researching and finding sources, and traveling around the U.S. to interview them. Last year, the documentary appeared in 26 film festivals and won eight awards, Kasthuri said.\n\"We want to start a conversation about the system as it stands, and things we can do to make it better,\" he said.",
