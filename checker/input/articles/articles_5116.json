    "title": "Military Conflicts at Historic High as US Signals Retreat from World Stage - Global Issues",
    "text": "Military Conflicts at Historic High as US Signals Retreat from World Stage\nOSLO, Norway, Jun 12 (IPS) - The world is experiencing a surge in violence not seen since the post-World War II era. 2024 marked a grim new record: the highest number of state-based armed conflicts in over seven decades.\nA staggering 61 conflicts were recorded across 36 countries last year, according to PRIO’s Conflict Trends: A Global Overview report. “This is not just a spike – it’s a structural shift. The world today is far more violent, and far more fragmented, than it was a decade ago,” warned Siri Aas Rustad, Research Director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and lead author of the report.\n“Now is not the time for the United States – or any global power – to retreat from international engagement. Isolationism in the face of rising global violence would be a profound mistake with long-term human life consequences.”\nThe report is based on data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. It shows that while the number of battle-related deaths in 2024 held steady at approximately 129,000 – matching the devastating toll of 2023 – this level of violence was far above the average for the past three decades. 2024 was the fourth most deadly year since the Cold War ended in 1989.\nTwo major wars dominated the battlefield: Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine claimed an estimated 76,000 lives, while the war in Gaza killed 26,000. But these headline conflicts are only part of the picture. What is increasingly alarming is the multiplication of conflicts within individual countries.\nMore than half of all conflict-affected states now face two or more separate state-based conflicts, which are internal conflicts where the government is one of the warring parties. In nine countries, there were three or more state-based conflicts.\nThis reflects a deepening complexity in global conflict dynamics – where state fragility, transnational actors and local grievances feed into overlapping crises that are harder to contain, let alone resolve.\n“Conflicts are no longer isolated. They’re layered, transnational and increasingly difficult to end,” said Rustad. “It is a mistake to assume the world can look away. Whether under President Trump or any future administration, abandoning global solidarity now would mean walking away from the very stability the U.S. helped build after 1945.”\nThe data also identified a rise in militant group activity as a key driver of new and sustained violence. While the Islamic State (IS) remained active in at least 12 countries, other groups like Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) expanded its footprint. JNIM operated in five West African countries in 2024.\nAfrica remained the most conflict-affected region last year, with 28 state-based conflicts recorded, nearly double the number from a decade earlier. Asia followed with 17, the Middle East with 10, Europe with 3 and the Americas with 2.\n“Our analysis shows that the global security landscape is not improving, it’s fracturing. And without sustained international engagement, the risks to civilians, regional stability and international order will only deepen,” warned Rustad.\nClick here to download the whole PRIO report, Conflict Trends: A Global Overview, 1946-2024.\nIPS UN Bureau\n© Inter Press Service (2025) — All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Молодежь, известная как поколение Z или зумеры, массово отказывается от дорогостоящих подписок на музыкальные стриминговые сервисы, такие как Spotify Premium, и возвращается к использованию классических MP3-плееров. Главная причина – стремительно растущая стоимость ежемесячных платежей, которая делает «аренду» музыки менее привлекательной, чем одноразовая покупка устройства. Об этом сообщает издание Daily Mail (DM). © Соцсети Индивидуальная премиум-подписка на Spotify в Великобритании обходится пользователю почти в £12 в месяц (примерно 1300 руб. по курсу на 14 августа 2025 года, – «Газета.Ru»), что составляет около £145 в год (около 15,6 тыс. руб). В то же время, как отмечают пользователи, простейшие MP3-плееры, способные хранить до 2000 песен, продаются всего за £20 (2100 руб). Это позволяет меломанам «купить» доступ к музыке навсегда вместо постоянных ежемесячных трат.\nПродолжение истории после рекламы Тренд активно набирает обороты в социальных сетях. Блогерша Симонализа из США, которой около 20 лет, опубликовала видео, демонстрируя свой MP3-плеер на 64 ГБ, способный вместить до 12 000 песен.\n«Я больше не хочу платить $100 (7,9 тыс. руб.) в год за музыку. У меня есть неограниченные пропуски, я могу выбрать любую песню, и я ничего не плачу!» – заявила она. Видео собрало более 11 000 лайков, а многие комментаторы согласились, что MP3-плееры – это будущее.\nДругие представители поколения Z, такие как 19-летний Лео, использующий свой старый iPod, или Сэмюэл Айрин из Нью-Йорка, активно делятся своими находками в TikTok, объявляя о «разрыве отношений» со Spotify. Пользователи жалуются не только на высокие цены, но и на «музыку в долг» с рекламой, которую они получают даже при платной подписке.\nПродолжение истории после рекламы MP3-плееры, популярные в 90-х и 2000-х годах до появления смартфонов и стриминговых платформ, переживают второе рождение, пишет DM. Эта тенденция перекликается с другой страстью поколения Z – виниловыми пластинками, продажи которых в 2023 году достигли 33-летнего максимума. Эксперты объясняют оба феномена «усталостью от стриминга», желанием получить физическую собственность, поддержать любимых артистов и выразить свою индивидуальность.\nМузыкальный продюсер Питер Литчфилд отмечает: «Потребление музыки, как и большинства онлайн-медиа, алгоритмически обусловлено, оно пассивно. Многие ищут новый, независимый опыт, то, что можно контролировать и чем владеть физически». По его словам, физические носители позволяют слушателю быть более активным и осознанным потребителем музыки.",

    "text": "El Sporting no avanza en el fichaje de Fabio, por el que Las Palmas pide 4 millones, y se centra en otras opciones [SPORTING 1905](/sporting1905) El futbolista fue sondeado hace varias semanas25 jul 2024 . Actualizado a las 23:08 h. El Real Sporting de Gijón sigue trabajando en reforzar el ataque rojiblanco, pero no ha aumentado las gestiones por Fabio González, al que Gerardo García contactó a comienzos del verano para sondear su situación. El creativo mediocampista está siendo uno más en la pretemporada de la UD Las Palmas y la entidad canaria no ha accedido a la hora de facilitar su salida en su último año de contrato, pese las peticiones de su jugador. En ese sentido, la escuadra isleña solicitó 4 millones de euros de traspaso ante la oferta recibida por Fabio para irse a Malasia con un contrato por tres temporadas por algo menos de 700.000 euros anuales. Cabe recordar que ante la ruptura del fichaje de Sergio Bermejo, Rubén Albés pierde a un extremo, pero también a un futbolista que puede jugar por dentro en el aspecto ofensivo. El madrileño jugó en el Celta B con el técnico gallego en el centro del campo, más como interior liberado y creativo, con la misma libertad para incidir entre líneas de un mediapunta, pero interviniendo más en el juego y la construcción de las jugadas de sus equipos. Fabio disfrutó de pocos minutos en el regreso amarillo a Primera, de manera similar a Eric Curbelo, ya fichado por el Sporting. Sin embargo, en el caso del centrocampista sufrió una importante lesión en el tobillo que le hizo pasar por quirófano y estar alejado de los terrenos de juego durante más de media temporada, aunque llegó a jugar 6 partidos. Por contra, venía siendo una figura importante temporadas anteriores en Segunda División, incluyendo la del ascenso, con 31 jornadas disputadas. En total acumula 123 encuentros con su camiseta. *Recibe gratis en tu móvil la última hora del Sporting con el canal de Whatsapp de Sporting1905 haciendo clic en el siguiente enlace; una vez dentro pulsa el botón 'seguir', que aparece arriba a la derecha de tu pantalla, y posteriormente pulsa en el símbolo de una campana tachada para recibir la notificación de las noticias. En cuanto a sus datos, Fabio destaca por su facilidad el pase, sobresaliendo tanto en intervenciones como en pases intentados, porcentaje de acierto en la entrega (85%) y a la hora de sumar pases progresivos, es decir, que superen alguna línea de presión del rival.
