    "title": "Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary",
    "text": "Today the Church celebrates the Feast of the Visitation, when Mary went to visit her sister Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist.\nThe Gospels tell us that when John felt the presence of Jesus in Mary’s womb, he leaped for joy in his own mother’s womb. At this moment, John was cleansed of original sin, and filled with the grace of God.\nThe earliest evidence of this feast’s celebration in the Church is its adoption by the Franciscan Chapter in 1263, under advisement from St. Bonaventure. The feast spread to many churches, but was celebrated on various dates. On April 6, 1389, Pope Urban VI extended the feast to the entire Church, with the hope that Christ and Our Lady would put an end to the Great Schism that was threatening the Church at the time.\nThe feast was originally assigned to July 2, the day after the octave of St. John, which is estimated to be around the time that Mary returned to Nazareth. However, during the Schism, many opposing bishops refused to adopt the feast, until it was confirmed at the Council of Basle in 1441. Pius IX raised the feast to the rank of a double of the second class on May 13, 1850.",

    "text": "International\nSending Short-Term Mission Teams\nThe LCMS Short-Term Mission Program is sending more volunteers on mission trips and filling more field requests than ever before.\n2023 was the biggest year yet for the LCMS Short-Term Mission Program, which sent more volunteers on mission trips and filled more field requests than ever before.\nShort-term mission trips offered by the program in 2024 are close to filling up as well. The LCMS has allocated $477,694 in grant money in 2024 to support this program.\nThe Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LAC) is one of the places where the demand for short-term volunteers is highest. And there is no shortage of willing volunteers. Even more teams and volunteers could be sent if there were additional volunteer coordinators to plan short-term mission trips.\n“In 2023, we still were not able to fill all the requests,” said Erin Alter, director of the LCMS Short-Term Mission Program. “The field still has more ways they can imagine using short-term volunteers. … We haven’t reached capacity yet. Adding more volunteer coordinators will allow us to do even more.”\nTo increase the LAC’s capacity to host short-term mission trips, missionary Dana Stigdon will join Erin Mackenzie as a volunteer coordinator. Stigdon and Mackenzie will divide and conquer, with Mackenzie serving as the coordinator for the LAC and Stigdon serving as the coordinator for the Dominican Republic.\nSince 2016, the program has sent hundreds of volunteers to the international mission field to support missionaries and local partner churches in their work to preach Christ crucified.\n“Short-term mission trips are good for getting congregations to ask themselves, ‘Have we ever thought about adopting a missionary? Maybe we could go on a short-term mission? Perhaps we could start praying regularly for a missionary?’” said Alter.\nShort-term mission trips take place all over the world, in all four LCMS mission regions. Some trips are intended for congregations; others are intended to be educational or are geared especially to church workers or people interested in long-term mission work.\nOver the past few years, the LAC has worked to develop mission education trips, where participants go and learn about mission work. In the last two years, the LAC has hosted three mission education trips specifically for seminary students.\n“There are two goals for these seminary trips. The first is recruitment, so future pastors can consider international missionary service,” said Alter. “The second is education. [Participants gain] a better understanding of international mission work, what our theology of mission is and how Lutheran congregations can be part of international work. It’s a great thing for them to be equipped with — they know from their own experience that there are ways their church can be involved.”\nNow, with the addition of Stigdon to the Short-Term Mission team, more of God’s people will be able to volunteer, support our international missionaries, learn about mission work and be a part of the LCMS’ work to spread the Gospel, plant Lutheran churches and show mercy all over the world.\nLearn More\n- Reporter article:\nShort-Term Team Visits Dominican Republic\n- Reporter article:\nShort-Term Team Serves in Puerto Rico\n- Lutherans Engage article:\nPromoting Physical and Spiritual Health in Peru\n- Lutherans Engage article:\nThe Stability of God’s Word\n- Find out more about\nmission service opportunities",

    "title": "Industrial Complex Proposal Threatens Some of the World's Clearest Skies for Astronomy",
    "text": "The ⁢pristine skies above ⁢Chile’s Atacama ⁣Desert, home ⁤too the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) ‍paranal Observatory, are under threat.‌ A proposed industrial project by AES Andes, a subsidiary of a U.S. power company, could disrupt one of⁤ the world’s most critical hubs for⁢ astronomical research.The project, ‍named‌ Inna, aims to​ establish a large-scale green hydrogen facility, but its potential environmental impact has⁤ raised alarms among scientists ‌and astronomers.\nWhy Paranal Matters Paranal Observatory is no ordinary research facility. It houses the Very ​Large Telescope (VLT), a marvel of ‍modern astronomy. ​The VLT consists of ‍four primary telescopes, each equipped with a 27-foot ‍(8.2-meter) mirror, ⁣and four smaller auxiliary telescopes with 6-foot (1.8-meter) mirrors. together, they create some of the sharpest and ‍most detailed​ images ‌of the cosmos ⁣ever‍ captured.From distant⁢ galaxies to nearby asteroids, the VLT ‍has been instrumental in ‌groundbreaking discoveries.\nHowever, the proposed Inna⁢ project could jeopardize this scientific treasure. The industrial complex would span over 7,413 acres‌ of the atacama ‍Desert,⁤ just 3 to 7 miles (5 to 11 kilometers) from Paranal’s telescopes. Plans include a port, hydrogen and ammonia production plants, ⁢and ⁢thousands of ⁤electric generators. While the‍ project promises economic ‌benefits, its environmental footprint could irreversibly alter the region’s unique ⁤conditions for stargazing.\nThe ‌Threat ‍to Dark Skies The Atacama desert is renowned for its exceptionally dark and clear skies.Its high elevation​ and arid ‌climate minimize atmospheric interference, making it ⁢an ideal‍ location for astronomical observations. ‍“Chile, ​and​ in particular ‌Paranal, is a‍ truly special place for astronomy—its dark skies are a natural heritage that transcends its borders ‌and benefits all humanity,” said an ESO spokesperson.\nLight pollution from ⁣the inna project could diminish the clarity of ⁣these skies, ⁢hindering the VLT’s ability to capture high-quality images. ‌This would not only impact current research but also future ‍discoveries. The telescope ‍has already contributed to important ⁢milestones, such ⁣as imaging 42 of the solar system’s largest‍ asteroids in‍ 2021 and capturing the aftermath ⁤of NASA’s DART mission in 2023. More recently, it provided the frist detailed image of a star outside ‍our galaxy.\nBalancing‍ Progress and Preservation AES Andes has emphasized its ⁣commitment to environmental and safety​ standards.⁢ “As with any project, our partnership with local communities and stakeholders is a ⁣top priority,‍ ensuring we are supporting local economic advancement, while maintaining the highest environmental and safety standards,” said Javier Dib,⁤ AES’ Chile Market ​Business Leader, in⁤ a ⁢ company statement .\nDespite these⁢ assurances, ESO officials remain concerned.The Atacama’s unique conditions‌ are irreplaceable, ⁣and any‍ disruption‍ could ⁣have far-reaching consequences ‍for astronomy.the region is already home ⁢to several⁣ world-class observatories, and ⁤its loss⁢ would be felt globally.\nWhat’s at Stake? The ⁢Inna project represents a classic clash between ⁤economic development and environmental preservation. While green hydrogen is⁢ a promising step toward ​sustainable ‍energy, its implementation ⁣must consider the broader impact. For ​astronomers,the Atacama Desert is more than just a location—it’s a gateway to the universe.\nAs the​ debate continues,one thing is clear: the skies​ above Paranal are‍ a priceless resource. Protecting them ensures that humanity can continue to explore⁤ the cosmos, uncovering secrets that have⁢ remained hidden⁢ for billions of years.\nThe⁣ Growing‍ Threat of Light Pollution to ⁤astronomy Astronomy,one of humanity’s oldest sciences,is facing an unprecedented challenge: light pollution. The pristine night ‍skies ⁤that have⁤ allowed us ⁣to explore the cosmos for centuries⁤ are increasingly under threat from artificial light and satellite constellations. Among ​the most affected areas is Paranal, home to one of the ‌world’s most advanced observatories, which now ‍faces risks ​from nearby industrial projects and the‍ growing clutter of Earth’s orbit.\nA graph illustrating how dark skies ⁢are above‌ Paranal compared to other observatories. Graphic: Falchi et al.2023 Paranal: A Global Treasure at Risk Paranal Observatory in Chile is renowned for its exceptionally⁤ dark⁤ skies, making it a cornerstone of modern astronomy. However,⁣ the nearby AES Andes industrial megaproject threatens this natural ⁤treasure.⁢ Xavier Barcons, Director General of the European Southern Observatory (ESO),‍ emphasized the⁢ gravity of the situation:⁢ “Dust emissions during construction, increased atmospheric turbulence, and especially light pollution will irreparably impact the capabilities for astronomical observation, which have thus far attracted multi-billion-euro investments by the ‌governments of the⁣ ESO⁣ Member States.”\nItziar de Gregorio, ESO’s⁢ Representative in Chile, echoed ⁤these concerns, stating,⁤ “Chile, and in particular Paranal, is a truly special place for astronomy—its dark skies are a ⁤natural heritage that transcends its borders and benefits all ⁤humanity. It is crucial to consider ⁤alternative locations ‍for this⁣ megaproject that do not endanger one of⁤ the world’s⁣ most crucial astronomical treasures.”\nThe Escalating Problem of Light‌ Pollution Light⁢ pollution is​ not just a ⁢local issue; it’s ⁤a global crisis.⁤ A 2022 study revealed​ that⁢ two-thirds of major observatories worldwide have experienced a 10% increase in⁣ light‌ pollution above natural levels. Paranal, while still relatively ‍unaffected, is not ⁢immune to⁤ this trend. The study’s authors issued⁣ a stark warning: “The outcomes emerging from this work are sending ⁢what might ‌be the last call for a serious, collective,​ unambiguous, no-compromise action to‍ lower light pollution now, whether it⁤ is generated from ‌artificial light or from sunlight​ reflected by artificial objects in​ orbit. Failing to take action implies⁣ a progressive decline of our ability to explore our Universe.”\nSatellites: A new Challenge for Astronomers Ground-based observatories aren’t the only ones affected. Earth’s orbit is becoming⁣ increasingly crowded‌ with satellites,​ especially megaconstellations ‍like SpaceX’s starlink. These⁢ satellites create streaks across astronomical ‌images, complicating observations and even affecting ‌space-based⁢ telescopes like Hubble. While⁤ software solutions exist to mitigate these ‍streaks, the ⁣problem persists and is ⁣expected ​to‍ worsen as more satellites ‍are launched.\nWhat’s at ​stake? The ‌stakes are high. ⁢Paranal, along with other cutting-edge facilities like‍ the Rubin Observatory and‍ the under-construction Giant Magellan Telescope, represents billions of dollars in ⁣investment and​ decades of scientific progress. The Rubin Observatory’s LSST Camera, set to achieve first light later this‌ year, promises groundbreaking discoveries—but only if the skies remain​ dark enough to allow them.\nAs light⁢ pollution continues to rise, the astronomical community is calling ⁣for urgent action. The ⁣preservation of dark skies is ​not just a scientific necessity; it’s ‍a cultural and environmental imperative. ‍Without immediate and‍ decisive‌ measures, humanity​ risks​ losing its ability to explore the cosmos, a loss that would reverberate far beyond ‍the realm⁣ of astronomy.\nPhoto: Lam Yik Fei‍ (Getty⁢ Images) The Growing Threat of Light Pollution to Astronomy In 2023,a groundbreaking study revealed that the night sky is becoming considerably brighter each year,with a staggering 9.6% annual increase in light‌ pollution. This​ alarming trend, uncovered through the⁣ analysis ⁤of over 50,000 ⁢observations from NOIRLab’s Globe at Night ‌ project, has made⁣ it increasingly⁣ tough for stargazers to see dimmer stars. ‍For many, these ​celestial wonders are now fully invisible, lost in the glare of artificial light.\nThis phenomenon isn’t just ⁤a‌ problem for amateur astronomers—it’s a ‌critical issue ​for professional observatories as well.The​ Atacama Desert in⁣ Chile, home ‍to ⁤some of the world’s most advanced telescopes, is⁢ particularly vulnerable. The region’s pristine ‍skies, ​once ‌ideal for astronomical research, are⁤ now under threat‌ from encroaching light pollution.\nThe Extremely Large Telescope:⁢ A Beacon ‌of Hope Amid these‌ challenges, the‍ astronomical community is​ pinning its hopes on ​the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) , set to become the largest visible and infrared light⁤ telescope in the world. With a colossal ⁣128-foot (39-meter) mirror,the ELT will⁤ gather ‌100 million times ‍more light than the human eye,enabling unprecedented discoveries. From⁣ distant exoplanets to the earliest days of the⁤ universe,this cutting-edge instrument promises to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.\nScheduled for its first light by ​the end of this‌ decade—likely around 2028—the ELT ​will be located at Cerro Armazones, near the existing ⁤Very ⁤Large Telescope (VLT). Though, its success hinges ⁤on preserving the darkness of the Atacama skies. As ⁢one ⁢researcher⁤ aptly⁣ put ​it, “Astronomical observatories can be seen as ‍the proverbial canary in a coal ‌mine. If we are not ‌able even‌ to keep the canary alive, then we can forget being able ⁣to⁣ solve ‍the problem of light pollution as a global environmental​ issue.”\nBeyond ⁤astronomy: The Wider Impact of⁢ Light Pollution Light pollution doesn’t just hinder our ability to explore the universe—it has far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human health. Studies‌ have shown that excessive artificial light disrupts⁣ wildlife behavior, affects plant ‍growth, and even interferes with human circadian rhythms. As the research team noted, addressing this issue is not just⁢ about preserving ⁣the​ night sky ⁣for astronomers; it’s​ about safeguarding the planet for ​future generations.\nEfforts to combat light pollution⁤ include adopting smarter lighting technologies, enforcing stricter regulations, and raising public awareness. ​By taking⁢ these steps, we can ensure that the skies‍ remain clear for both scientific discovery and the simple ⁣joy of stargazing.\nAs we look to the future, the extremely Large Telescope stands as a symbol of humanity’s quest for⁢ knowledge. But its success—and the future of astronomy—depends on our ability to protect‌ the darkness⁤ that makes such discoveries possible.\nWordPress vs. HTML: Choosing ​the ⁢Best SEO-Pleasant Website Platform When it‌ comes to building a website, one of the most critical decisions ⁤is selecting the right platform. For those prioritizing search ⁤engine optimization (SEO), the choice frequently ⁣enough boils down to WordPress or HTML. Both have‍ their strengths, but⁢ understanding⁣ their differences can help​ you make an informed decision tailored⁣ to your needs.\nWhy WordPress is a Top Choice for Beginners and Small Businesses WordPress has long been a favorite among ⁢beginners and small⁣ business owners, and‌ for good reason. ⁤its user-friendly interface makes it easy to set⁣ up and manage, ⁣even ​for those with no technical background. But what ‌truly sets WordPress apart is its robust ecosystem ‌of SEO plugins. Tools like Yoast SEO and Rank Math allow users to optimize ‌their content effortlessly, from meta descriptions ‍to ​keyword density.\nMoreover, WordPress is highly customizable. With thousands of themes and plugins available, you can tailor your‍ site⁤ to meet specific SEO‍ requirements without needing to⁣ write a single⁤ line of ⁤code. This adaptability makes it an excellent choice for those looking to grow their online presence quickly and efficiently.\nHTML: The ​Developer’s ‌Playground for⁤ Speed ⁢and Control On the ⁣other hand, ‌HTML is the go-to option for developers or those building static ⁢websites. Unlike⁢ WordPress, which relies⁢ on a database and dynamic content, HTML sites are lightweight and ​load ‍faster. This speed is a significant advantage for SEO, as search engines prioritize fast-loading websites.\nHTML ​also ‍offers ‍unparalleled control ⁣over every aspect of your site. Developers can fine-tune every element⁣ to ensure optimal performance and SEO compliance.However,this level of‍ customization requires ​a solid understanding of coding,making it less ⁣accessible for beginners.\nSEO-Intensive Projects: ​Weighing ‍the Pros and Cons For SEO-intensive projects, both‌ platforms have their merits. WordPress provides a wealth of tools and plugins designed to ​enhance ​your site’s search⁤ engine ​ranking.These tools simplify tasks like⁤ keyword optimization, backlink tracking, and content analysis, making it easier to stay ‌ahead of the competition.\nHTML,⁢ meanwhile, gives you ​complete control over your site’s ⁤SEO. Without⁣ the constraints of a content management system, you can ⁤implement advanced techniques like schema markup and custom meta tags. This level of precision ⁢can be a‍ game-changer for‍ those with​ the technical expertise to​ leverage it.\nKey‍ Considerations for Your Decision When​ choosing between WordPress ​and HTML, consider your technical skills, project requirements, and long-term goals. If you’re⁤ a beginner or running a small ⁤business, WordPress’s ease of use and SEO tools make it a⁢ clear winner. ⁣For developers ‍or those⁢ prioritizing ⁢speed and customization, HTML is the better ⁤option.\nUltimately,​ the best platform is the one that aligns with your needs and helps you achieve your SEO objectives.​ Whether you choose WordPress or ⁤HTML, the key is to ​focus on creating‌ high-quality content and optimizing ⁣your site for both users and search engines.\n“WordPress is ideal due to its ease of⁢ use and ‌it‍ has⁤ various SEO ⁤plugins. For developers or static websites, HTML is ⁣a⁢ better option since you can customize the entire website​ and⁣ have ⁤a faster performance.”\nBy carefully ⁢evaluating your options and understanding the strengths of each⁢ platform, you ‌can build a website that not⁢ only ⁢looks ⁤great but also ranks⁢ well in search engine results. Happy building!\nWhat helps make WordPress a ⁣more accessible platform for SEO, as opposed to HTML? R⁢ websites for search​ engines without needing to ‌delve ⁢into complex coding. These plugins provide guidance on keyword usage, meta descriptions, and ⁤other critical SEO elements, making it easier⁣ for users to ⁢improve their⁢ search engine rankings.\nAdditionally, WordPress offers a wide range ‍of themes and⁣ templates that are designed with SEO in mind. ‍These themes are often mobile-responsive,fast-loading,and optimized for user experience—all factors that search ⁣engines like Google prioritize. The platform also supports regular updates, ensuring that yoru website remains secure and up-to-date with‍ the latest SEO practices.\nThe ‌Flexibility of HTML for Advanced ⁢Users On‌ the other⁤ hand, HTML websites offer a ​level of‍ control and flexibility that ‌is hard to match. For advanced users or those⁢ with specific technical requirements, building a website from scratch using HTML can be‌ a‌ powerful option. As every line of code is ⁢written by hand,developers have ⁤complete control over the site’s structure,design,and ⁢functionality. This level of customization can lead to highly optimized websites that load quickly and perform well in search⁤ engine rankings.\nHowever, the downside of HTML ⁢is that it ‍requires a notable amount of technical expertise. Unlike WordPress, where SEO optimization ⁢can‍ be managed through plugins, HTML websites require manual ​coding​ for every SEO element.This includes meta tags, alt text for images, and structured data, among ​others. for‌ those without⁤ a strong background in web⁢ development, this can be a daunting⁢ task.\nMaintenance and⁢ Scalability When it comes to⁤ maintenance, WordPress‌ has a clear advantage.‍ The platform’s‌ content management system ‌(CMS)‌ makes it easy to update content, add new pages, and manage⁣ plugins. This is especially beneficial for businesses ⁢that⁢ need‍ to ⁢frequently update their websites with⁤ new facts or ​blog posts. WordPress also offers a wide‌ range of plugins for scalability, allowing ⁣your website ⁣to grow alongside ⁤your business.\nHTML websites, while highly customizable, can be ‍more challenging to maintain. ‍Any changes to the ⁤site require manual updates to the code, which ⁢can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, scaling ⁣an ⁣HTML website often ⁢requires significant ‍rework, making it⁣ less ideal for businesses that anticipate rapid growth.\nSecurity Considerations Security is another important⁣ factor to consider. WordPress, being a widely used platform, is⁤ often targeted by hackers. however, the platform’s‍ large ‌community means that security vulnerabilities⁤ are⁤ quickly identified and patched.By using reputable plugins and keeping your WordPress installation‌ up-to-date, you can substantially reduce the ⁤risk of security breaches.\nHTML ⁢websites, when properly coded, can be more secure as⁢ they ‍don’t rely on third-party plugins or ⁢themes.though, this also ‍means that the responsibility for security⁣ falls​ entirely on the developer. Any vulnerabilities in ⁣the code could potentially be exploited, making⁣ it ‌crucial to follow best practices for web ‌security.\nCost Implications cost is another​ factor that can influence your decision. WordPress itself ​is free, but you’ll need to pay for hosting, themes, and⁤ plugins. ​While there ‌are ‍many​ free options available,‍ premium themes ‌and plugins can add⁢ up, especially if you​ require​ advanced features.\nHTML websites,‍ on the other hand, can be more cost-effective ​in ⁢the long run,⁣ particularly⁣ if you have the technical skills to ⁢build and maintain the site yourself.However, if you‍ need to hire a developer, the initial costs can be significantly higher.\nConclusion: ​Which is ⁣Best for​ SEO? Ultimately, the choice ⁤between WordPress and HTML depends on ‌your specific needs and technical expertise. For most ​users, especially beginners ⁤and small businesses, WordPress ⁤offers a more accessible and SEO-friendly solution. Its user-friendly interface, extensive plugin ecosystem, and ‍scalability make ​it an ⁣excellent choice for those looking to optimize their website for search engines without needing to dive into⁣ complex coding.\nFor advanced users or those with specific technical requirements, HTML provides unparalleled control ​and flexibility. ⁤Though, ⁤this comes at the cost of increased​ complexity and ⁢maintenance requirements.‌ If you have the​ technical skills and resources to manage an HTML website,​ it‍ can be a powerful tool⁤ for achieving top search‌ engine rankings.\nIn either ‍case, the ‍key to prosperous SEO ⁣lies in understanding‌ the strengths and limitations of your chosen platform and leveraging them to create ‌a website that is‌ both user-friendly and ‌optimized for search‌ engines. Whether you choose WordPress or HTML, the ⁣goal is ‍the same: to create a website that attracts ​and ‌engages your target audience while ranking ⁢well in search engine ⁢results.",

    "title": "Canadians across country celebrate New Year's Day with polar bear swims",
    "text": "Hundreds of people across Canada shrieked, shivered and smiled their way into a new year on Monday as they took part in the long-standing tradition of Jan. 1 polar bear dips.\nCanadians have been marking New Year's Day with plunges into lakes, oceans and rivers made frigid by typical January conditions since at least 1920, and scheduled events in cities spanning Halifax to Vancouver were poised to maintain the ritual.\nJoanie McNally, from Sackville, N.S., lost no time in kicking off this year's polar dips when she ran into the icy ocean water at Queensland Beach on Nova Scotia's South Shore at 9 a.m. Monday morning. In doing so, she also fulfilled a long-standing personal goal.\n“We’re always at this beach, but this is the first time (swimming) when it’s on the more frigid side,” she said moments before taking the plunge.\n“It’s a bit of a challenge to start the new year on the right track.”\nThe temperature sat around -5 C as McNally and 11 other swimmers stripped off their winter jackets, mittens and hats and went off into the icy waves.\nMcNally’s husband and daughter, along with a handful of other spectators, cheered and hollered for the group as they ran from the frozen sand to the chilly water.\nDave Morash, also from the Sackville area, said this is the coldest polar plunge he’s done in at least six years.\nMorash and a small group of fellow high school teachers have been doing the plunge together since 2018, but he says this is the first time since then that the temperature has been below zero on New Years Day.\n“It’s invigorating, it’s like all of your nerve endings start tingling,” he said immediately after the dip.\n“I always refer to it as a reboot, you sort of reboot your system like a computer. So here we go, here comes 2024,” he said with a laugh as he dried off.\nMonday's swim, while launching new traditions for some, also marked a departure from New Year's Days past in Halifax.\nFor many years, swimmers jumped into the ocean from a city wharf as part of the Herring Cove Polar Bear Dip. The non-profit organization that had put on the event since 1994 cancelled the 2021 dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has not resumed since.\nA recent social media post from the Herring Cove Polar Dip organization says it is “hoping to look at options going forward” for future events and asked for volunteer support.\nWhen Halifax resident Darrell Robert found out there would not be an organized dip yet again this year, he suggested in comments on social media that people meet at Queensland Beach for an impromptu swim.\n“It's nice to corral people and motivate each other to do something new on a new year,” he said, adding he was pleased to see so many faces show up at the beach Monday morning.\n“I like to see people get together as a community, I think it’s great and it's a great start to the new year.”\nSmall groups of cold-water swimmers are expected to do their own polar plunges throughout Nova Scotia. More than 20 swimmers in Halifax took an icy plunge into the Northwest Arm at Sir Sandford Fleming Park.\nSimilar events, many of which are intended to raise money for charity, are set to take place in locations including Charlottetown, Saint John, N.B. and Vancouver.\nIn Oakville, Ont., a city just west of Toronto, the return of sub-zero temperatures following days of unseasonably mild conditions proved no deterrent for the roughly 850 people who took part in a plunge at Coronation Park. The swim in Lake Ontario was intended to raise money for charity World Vision Canada.\nCEO Michael Messenger said this year’s dip has so far raised $100,000 towards projects that help provide clean water in developing countries.\nThe 39th annual Oakville plunge marked the first such dip for 11-year-old Luca Tarabokia.\n“I’m pretty excited for it because the waves look awesome and I like the waves,” Tarabokia said.\n“It’s my first time. I want to do it again next year if it goes well.\"\nHis mother, Jane Moran, called Tarabokia the \"cold water representative\" for their family.\n“You’ve got to have a certain fortitude to be able to do this and I really, really admire those who are able to do it, but I’m not one of them,\" she said with a laugh.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 1, 2024.\nLyndsay Armstrong and Ritika Dubey, The Canadian Press",
