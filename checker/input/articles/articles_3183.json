    "text": "Alexandria extended their home winning streak to ten games dating back to last season thanks to a huge performance from Jordyn Johnson. The Alexandria Trojans sure made it a nail-biter, but they managed to escape with a 66-63 win over the Northwest Raiders on Tuesday thanks in part to Johnson, who went 9 of 22 en route to 24 points. That makes it three consecutive games in which he has scored at least a third of Alexandria's points.\nAlexandria has been performing well recently as they've won five of their last six contests, which provided a nice bump to their 21-5 record this season. As for Northwest, they are on a four-game losing streak that has dropped them down to 11-9.\nBoth squads will have to hit the road in their upcoming games. Alexandria will venture away from home to face off against Neville at 5:30 p.m. on Friday. Neville knows how to get points on the board -- the team has finished with 55 points or more in their past three matches -- so hopefully Alexandria likes a good challenge. Northwest has already played their next game (against Tara), but no score has been uploaded at the time of writing.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",

    "text": "Residents across parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia face two extreme weather crises: severe flood watches and uncontrollable wildfires . The National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for several counties in Pennsylvania, while over 7,500 acres in Virginia have been consumed by wildfires, prompting immediate evacuations and state emergencies.\nAdvertisment Imminent Flood Threat in Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania, Lebanon, Adams, York, and Lancaster counties are under a flood watch, with the National Weather Service warning of excessive rainfall that could lead to significant flooding. This advisory comes amid forecasts predicting heavy rain throughout the weekend, putting flood-prone areas at high risk. Residents have been urged to monitor weather updates closely, adhere to safety guidelines, and be ready to evacuate if necessary. The emphasis remains on safeguarding lives and property as conditions are expected to deteriorate.\nWildfires Ravage Virginia's Landscape Advertisment Meanwhile, in Virginia, a different crisis unfolds as more than 100 wildfires, fueled by high winds and low humidity, have devastated over 7,500 acres in less than 24 hours. The blazes, exacerbated by downed power lines, have led to multiple evacuations and the declaration of local states of emergency across Central Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley. Firefighting forces, both state and local, are tirelessly working to contain the spreading fires, which have already resulted in the destruction of buildings and the issuance of evacuation alerts to residents in affected areas.\nCommunity and Emergency Response Both states have mobilized extensive emergency response efforts to address the unfolding crises. In Pennsylvania, authorities are closely monitoring the situation, providing regular updates, and coordinating with local communities to ensure preparedness for potential flooding. Virginia has seen a similar mobilization, with firefighters and emergency personnel responding to wildfire outbreaks, aided by community evacuations to minimize casualties and property damage. These events highlight the unpredictable nature of weather-related disasters and the importance of timely, coordinated response efforts.\nAs residents in both states brace for the impact of these dual threats, the emphasis on community safety and adherence to evacuation orders cannot be overstated. The coming days will be crucial in managing the fallout from these events, with hopes pinned on the resilience of the affected communities and the effectiveness of the emergency responses. These disasters serve as a stark reminder of the power of nature and the need for preparedness and vigilance in the face of its unpredictability.",

The Roger Varian-trained winner made contact with fourth home Verbier after Blanchland drifted right when leaving the stalls, which resulted in Tyrrhenian Sea being forced to the back of the field. However, the son of Dark Angel stayed on well under Mitchell to produce a powerful turn of foot and win for the first time since February 2022. Speaking to Sky Sports Racing, Mitchell said: \"He’s had good runs on the turf but the all-weather is definitely his game. Coming into the race he was in the form of his life. \"It took us a few steps to get going but I let him do his own thing and find his rhythm. I did the Lingfield manoeuvre, which was to try to get on the pace before it quickened and, as I did, it dropped coming into the straight and he hit the line well. \"We didn’t have Lord North to deal with, but I don’t see why he can’t compete at Group level again.\" Tyrrhenian Sea has now won four times on the all-weather and Alan Cooper, racing manager to owners the Niarchos family, added: \"He’s been knocking at the door several times and now he’s won, which is fantastic. He’s the stable icon.\" The victory brought up a double for Mitchell, who also scored in the opening 7f handicap on the Mark Rimell-trained [Thapa Vc](https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/3164268/thapa-vc/form).

    "text": "Trending:\nHow to grow passion fruit at home in the garden: professional tips\nPassion fruit is a tropical plant by origin. In nature, this type of passion fruit is found in Brazil, but experienced agronomists say that it is quite possible to grow the fruit in an ordinary Ukrainian garden.\nSerhii Avramenko, a senior researcher at the Yuriev Institute of Plant Industry of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine, Doctor of Agricultural Sciences, told us how to do it correctly. He devoted a separate video to growing passion fruit on his\nYouTube channel.\nAccording to Avramenko, the first thing to do is to be careful when choosing a plant variety. The dark purple Pasiflora edulis, whose fruits are sold in stores as exotic fruits, is unlikely to survive the Ukrainian climate. The even more delicious Pasiflora granadila or sweet passion fruit has virtually no chance of surviving in our latitudes. But Pasiflora incarnata, also known as the northern passion fruit, will do very well in any climatic zone of Ukraine. According to Avramenko, there are even Ukrainian varieties of this species.\nNorthern passion fruit can be propagated by seeds and rhizome division. However it is important to keep in mind that the seeds of the plant may not pass on its varietal characteristics to the next generation, and the vine grown in this way is likely to fail to produce a crop.\nIf you grow passion fruit by dividing the rhizomes, you need to store the planting material wrapped in moss in cold and relatively humid conditions. A cellar or refrigerator will do.\nThe purchased rhizome must first be germinated. The substrate for germination can be different – soil, peat, or moss. However, Avramenko advises choosing moss the most, because it protects the roots of the plant from decay.\nSpread the roots on the moss and sprinkle the same substrate on top. Put everything in a warm place. You can germinate the plant in a greenhouse or on a windowsill. The air temperature should be 25-30 degrees. \"When the sprout appears, cut off a piece of the root with the sprout and place it in a cup with a nutrient substrate,\" the agronomist recommends.\nIt is better to plant several passion fruit varieties at once on one plot. This will provide them with better pollination.\nThe young vine will be ready for planting in the open ground when it reaches a height of 0.5 meters. Smaller sprouts can become prey for ants, so it is better to grow them to the optimal size.\nIt is important to move the plant into the ground only when the threat of frost has passed. The best time is the end of May or early summer. The distance between the vines should be 0.5 meters.\nAvramenko also told us about another way of growing passion fruit. It requires digging up the vine while it is still green in the fall and planting it in a pot. This pot is placed in a warm and bright room, where it winters.\nThis method is dangerous because the passion fruit stem can grow too early. In this case, it will form long but weak shoots.\nIn any case, you will need support to grow passion fruit, because it is a vine that can weave. Therefore, take care of trellises like grapes. The length of the passion flower vine is about 3 meters, but it can reach 5 meters.\nSubscribe to the OBOZ.UA channels in\nTelegram and Viber to keep up with the latest events.",

    "title": "Spring storms to bring up to 6 inches of snow to some regions",
    "text": "We are going to start this Friday morning, marking the end of the first week of spring with a major winter storm warning. Yeah, more than 30 millionaire on alert. From the Rockies to New England, some regions could get up to a foot and a half of snow. Meantime, many areas not getting snow are bracing for heavy rain. 50 million under flood watches up and down the East Coast, with 7 inches expected in parts of Florida. We’ve got it all covered for you this morning, including Mr. Roker’s full forecast. But let’s start with NBC’s Maggie Vespa. She’s in Milwaukee, WI, where it looks like the flakes are already falling. Maggie, good morning. Oh, Craig, good morning. That is such, respectfully, an understatement. The word I can think of right now is pouring like snow feels like it’s pouring here in Milwaukee. And for reference, you can already see how much has fallen. Last night there was nothing on the ground. This place was completely dry. But you can see we’re close to like half a foot, which was the forecast in total here in Milwaukee. It feels like some parts are already reaching that forecasted peak. So we’ll see how this goes. We also have and again this is 3 days in to spring. We have video overnight from other cities. They’re just getting slammed by this severe winter system. Madison, WI. The roads are already a mess there as well. The morning commute expected to be a bit rough because of that similar story here. And then also in Minneapolis, MN, that city get this expected to get half its forecasted snowfall total for the entire season or it’s actually its total to date for the entire season. So half of that could fall with just this one storm. And that speaks to how severe of a swing this is amid an ongoing, what they call snow drought. We have some numbers here to kind of speak to this from cities that are frankly as we know, normally a bunch of snow falling on us as we from the tree above us as we talk about this. Normally these are like a winter Wonderland, right. We’re talking about Duluth, MN. They’re close to five feet shy of their average snowfall total for this time of year in Minneapolis. They are having their driest winter since the early 30s. So guys, again, we’re talking about half a foot with this first system, and it’s part of a 1-2 punch that we’re talking about over the next week or so. So this is bringing definitely some needed moisture. Again, springtime snow bringing needed moisture. And it’s packing quite a punch in the process. Looks like it. Maggie Vespa force there in a snowy Milwaukee. Maggie. Thank you. All right, let’s get over to Al for a check on this weekend. How bad is it going to get? OK, so we’ve got three storms we’re going to be looking at. OK. So we’ve got this number one storm in the Midwest that’s going to bring heavy snow to New England. We’ve got a flooding or floodings are going to ramp up along the East Coast. And then there’s a major spring storm that’s going to be coming into the West. So let’s get started here. We’ll start with Storm #1, winter alerts, 32 million people from Montana all the way to England where we have winter storm warnings out. And then we’ve got these flood watches from 50 million people from Bahaba, Maine all the way down to Washington DC, the Delmarva Peninsula all along the I-95 Carter. So today we’ve got snow up to the north, down to the South. We’re looking at heavy rain flood risk, Southern Florida and New England, I should say the southeast tomorrow flood threat making its way into the Mid-Atlantic states. Heavy, wet snow for northern New England. With those trees starting to bud and leaf, there could be power outages. Rainfall amounts down in southern Florida. Six to seven inches. We move along the coast 1 to 4 inches. Could be upwards of five or six. In parts of the Northeast snowfall, we’ve got two to three inches as we move our way across the Great Lakes. Upwards of 18 inches of snow locally in New England. And then Sunday, this next storm brings Montana, Michigan heavy snow into the upper Midwest, severe storms in the lower Mississippi River valley, a foot and a half of snow from the Dakotas into Wisconsin. So this is going to be crippling over the weekend, the I-95 Carters and mess guys, the upper Midwest into Monday. So air travel going to be a big problem.",

La revisión fue muy criticada por su aspecto gráfico y por no corregir fallos del pasado, aunque [un reciente parche ha solucionado un gran problema](https://www.vidaextra.com/accion/tres-anos-despues-infame-gta-the-trilogy-recibe-actualizacion-mejoras-que-hacen-que-luzca-muchisimo-mejor). Y es que Rockstar Games por fin ha incluido en consolas y PC la solicitad iluminación clásica que tan solo estaba disponible en dispositivos móviles. Sin embargo, la empresa ha realizado un cambio en los créditos que no ha sentado nada bien al estudio autor del remaster. Y es que en la pantalla de inicio ya no aparece el logo de Grove Street Games, lo cual parece una señal directa contra los responsables por parte de Rockstar. Sí que permanecen registrados en los créditos finales, pero la inclusión de Video Games Deluxe, antiguos creadores de [L.A. Noire](https://www.vidaextra.com/analisis/la-noire-primer-contacto), parece revelar que esta nueva empresa ha sido la artífice de las correcciones recientemente incluidas. Este gesto no ha sentado nada bien en el seno de Grove Street Games, sobre todo si tenemos en cuenta las palabras de Thomas Williamson, CEO de la marca. A través de un mensaje en X, ha querido mostrar su descontento con lo sucedido. Hablando hipotéticamente: Es una gilipollez eliminar a los desarrolladores principales de los créditos en una actualización, especialmente cuando una actualización incluye cientos de correcciones que fueron proporcionados por esos desarrolladores que permanecieron fuera del alcance de los jugadores durante años. Williamson ha querido reivindicar el esfuerzo de su equipo, si bien la desarrolladora ha dejado de seguir en las redes sociales a Rockstar Games a consecuencia de este hecho. Si bien ya se podía intuir que los padres de la saga no contarían con la compañía tras su implicación Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, ahora es todavía más evidente que la relación está rota.

    "text": "Advertisement\nUpdated March 27th 2025, 20:16 IST\nMassive Job Cuts: Trump Admin Slashes 10,000 HHS Positions to Save $1.8 Billion Annually\nThe job cuts will bring down the department’s staff strength from 82,000 to 72,000, resulting in an estimated annual savings of $1.8 billion.\nWorld News\n- 3 min read\nSurabhi Shaurya\nNew Delhi: The Donald Trump administration has announced a massive reduction in the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), cutting 10,000 positions in a bid to streamline operations and reduce costs.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the job cuts will bring down the department’s staff strength from 82,000 to 72,000, resulting in an estimated annual savings of $1.8 billion. The move is part of the administration’s broader effort to downsize government agencies and improve efficiency.\n“The restructuring will address this and serve multiple goals without impacting critical services. First, it will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce of about 10,000 full-time employees who are part of this most recent transformation. When combined with HHS’ other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.”, an official press release issued by\nHHS read.\nStreamlining HHS: RFK Jr's Plan\nThe restructuring will streamline the functions of the Department. Currently, the 28 divisions of the HHS contain many redundant units. The restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 new divisions, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and will centralize core functions such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement, External Affairs, and Policy. Regional offices will be reduced from 10 to 5.\nThe overhaul will implement the new HHS priority of ending America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins. These priorities will be reflected in the reorganization of HHS.\nThe restructuring will improve Americans’ experience with HHS by making the agency more responsive and efficient, while ensuring that Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential health services remain intact.\n“We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\nTerming the move a beneficial step for both taxpayers and the public, Secretary Kennedy stated that bureaucracies like HHS tend to become inefficient over time, despite having dedicated and competent staff.\nHe stated that the overhaul aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency, aligning with the administration’s broader objective of enhancing the nation’s healthcare system under the “Make America Healthy Again” initiative.\nFor the unversed, the Trump administration has been pushing for cost-cutting measures across several federal agencies, citing the need to reduce government expenditure. The HHS job reduction follows similar moves in other departments as part of the administration’s restructuring plans.\nPublished March 27th 2025, 20:16 IST",
