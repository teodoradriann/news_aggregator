    "title": "Justice Alito gets caught by an undercover activist - Chicago Sun-Times",
    "text": "Justice Alito has a chip on his shoulder A filmmaker and activist secretly recorded Alito at a dinner. Public officials, especially judges, won’t get into trouble if they maintain their composure and remember not to enlist in the culture wars. I am not a fan of hidden microphone ambushes. It’s sneaky and dishonest. The kind of ambush that journalist and activist Lauren Windsor pulled off at the recent Supreme Court Historical Society dinner was particularly unseemly because she posed as a conservative activist type and attempted to lead the witnesses — Supreme Court justices and spouses — into saying something clickbaity that could be shopped to an ideological ally in the press. Windsor, a progressive, is taking a leaf from James O’Keefe’s playbook. Windsor struck out with Chief Justice John Roberts. The country was living through “tumultuous” times, she suggested, and wondered what the court could do to repair the polarization. Roberts was dubious. “The first thing ... is to tell me when the non-tumultuous time has been ... you look at what the court was doing in the 1960s, what the court was doing during the New Deal, what the court was doing after Dred Scott ... “ Windsor persisted, asking whether the justice thinks it’s part of the court’s role to “guide us back toward a more moral path?” The chief justice’s response was pitch perfect: “No. The role of the court is deciding cases. If I start, would you want to put me in charge of guiding us toward a more moral path? That’s for the people we elect. That’s not for lawyers.” Finally, Roberts denied that we are a “Christian nation,” noting that Jewish and Muslim Americans would beg to differ. Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary. Roberts demonstrated historical perspective, modesty about the court’s role (and his own), and clear impatience with the idea that the court should serve as some sort of Sanhedrin for American society. Windsor used the same tactics with Justice Samuel Alito and got a different result. She began by praising him as a “fighter” and then proposed that as a Catholic herself, she doesn’t know if we can “really negotiate with the left in a way that needs to happen for the polarization to end” and that “it’s a matter of like, winning.” He agreed. “One side or the other is going to win. I don’t know.” It’s easy to read too much into a few stray responses to an agent provocateur. Alito said, “I agree with you” several times. Was that what he really meant? It’s possible that he was just being polite or was trying to get rid of her and get to the bar or the parking lot. And while he did say that there are “differences on fundamental things that cannot be compromised,” he also said that there are ways of “working, living together peacefully.” But this recording, coming on the heels of the flag stories — and Alito’s peevish Wall Street Journal article denying that he violated ethics rules when he accepted lavish gifts and declined to report them on financial disclosure forms or recuse himself from cases tangentially related to a benefactor — begin to paint a picture of a justice with a chip on his shoulder. Justices should avoid ‘culture wars’ Every public figure, for better or worse, needs to assume that nothing they say outside their own homes is truly private. Just ask Barack “I’ll have more flexibility after the election” Obama or Mitt “47 percent” Romney about open mics and surreptitious recordings. At the same time, as Roberts demonstrated, public officials, especially judges, won’t get into trouble if they maintain their composure and remember not to enlist in the culture wars. Alito should be above agreeing that one side or the other must “win” in our current disputes. That’s too close to the kind of Flight 93 talk that has so distorted the right’s perspective on public policy. The most important thing for a justice to stress is process. We won’t agree on everything, but as long as we obey the law and work out compromises in our existing institutions, we remain strong. As long as everyone has a chance to express their views, vote their conscience and have their rights respected, we’ll be OK. Talk of existential crises is dangerous. Alito is not responsible for the views of his wife, but her unguarded remarks were particularly unfortunate. She isn’t confirmed for anything, and yet, she still has a role to play in our system. For the sake of the court’s stature and legitimacy, it’s important that no one so closely associated with one of the nine justices betray so much animus toward people on the other side of the political spectrum. Asked about the flags she flew over their Virginia and New Jersey homes, Martha-Ann Alito was caustic. “I want a Sacred Heart of Jesus flag because I have to look across the lagoon at the pride flag for the next month.” Sorry, but having to see symbols and language you disagree with is the basic requirement of life in a free society. Also, Mrs. Alito’s anger about it seems grossly misplaced. If someone were flying a swastika or hammer-and-sickle flag (which would also be legal), her rage would be understandable. But the pride flag? We live in a diverse, free and often raucous country. Justices of the Supreme Court and their families cannot be expected to be untouched by passion or partisanship. But they can model respect for differing views and commitment to compromise. Mona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the “Beg to Differ” podcast.

    "text": "A teenage boy has died after being bitten by a shark at a remote beach on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula. Emergency services were called to Ethel Beach in Innes National Park with reports of a shark attack at 1.30pm on Thursday. There, at the popular surf beach hemmed in by towering cliffs, they recovered the teenager's body. Local surfer Luke Sykora spoke of his shock over the tragedy. \"I have a seen a fair few sharks here over 22 years, but that is the first fatal attack that we've had down here,\" he told ABC News. \"I wouldn't wish it upon anyone … to even be at the same beach at the same time. \"I think the town would be mourning. I think it's very sad and very tragic and a bit of an eye-opener.\" The attack comes after a spate of serious shark bites in recent months, including the fatal attack of 55-year-old Tod Gendle at Granites Beach on the state's West Coast in October. His was the second shark death this year after 46-year-old teacher Simon Baccanello disappeared without a trace in May while surfing at Walkers Rock Beach, about 365km west of Adelaide. Police are preparing a report for the coroner.",

    "text": "O Museu de Arqueologia e Etnografia do Distrito de Setúbal (MAEDS) prepara-se para receber uma nova e emocionante exposição temporária intitulada “Gestos Entrelaçados”. Esta mostra, que foi inaugurada a 7 de junho, promete trazer uma nova perspectiva sobre a arte contemporânea, destacando a intersecção entre tapeçarias e desenhos.\nO Museu de Arqueologia e Etnografia do Distrito de Setúbal\nFundado em 1974, o MAEDS ocupa um edifício histórico do século XVIII e posiciona-se como um espaço dedicado à memória e à cultura da região. Com um acervo diversificado que abrange tanto a arqueologia como a etnografia, o museu também abriga obras de arte contemporânea, refletindo a riqueza cultural de Setúbal.\nO acervo do MAEDS é notável pela sua representatividade da história local, incluindo artefatos arqueológicos e etnográficos. A exposição permanente é dividida em dois setores principais: um dedicado à arqueologia e outro à etnografia. Além disso, o museu atua como um centro de estudos arqueológicos, promovendo pesquisas e atividades educativas.\nA Exposição “Gestos Entrelaçados”\nAnualmente, o MAEDS organiza uma série de exposições temporárias que ampliam o seu alcance cultural. A nova exposição “Gestos Entrelaçados” é uma dessas iniciativas, que visa destacar a arte contemporânea e as suas diversas formas de expressão.\nA exposição “Gestos Entrelaçados” apresenta obras da artista Guida Fonseca, que utiliza técnicas de tapeçaria, e da desenhista Teresa Melo, que traz uma abordagem única ao desenho. Ambas as artistas exploram a relação entre gesto, matéria e tempo, criando um diálogo sensível entre as suas obras.\nArtistas em destaque:\n- Guida Fonseca: Conhecida pelas suas tapeçarias, Guida utiliza fios e texturas para contar histórias visuais que refletem a cultura e a identidade. A sua obra “Entre fios e tempos” é um exemplo perfeito de como a tapeçaria pode ser uma forma de expressão artística rica e complexa.\n- Teresa Melo: Com um enfoque no desenho, Teresa apresenta “Entre o caos e a harmonia”, onde as suas criações visuais dialogam com a obra de Guida, criando uma experiência imersiva para os visitantes.\nAs obras de Guida e Teresa não coexistem apenas, mas também se entrelaçam num diálogo íntimo. A interação entre as técnicas de tapeçaria e desenho proporciona uma nova dimensão à experiência artística, convidando o público a refletir sobre a relação entre o gesto criativo e a transformação da matéria.\nA inauguração da exposição foi um evento aberto ao público. Os visitantes podem explorar as obras de Guida Fonseca e Teresa Melo até dia 23 de agosto. Este é um convite para todos que desejam aprofundar na arte contemporânea e na cultura local.\nA exposição “Gestos Entrelaçados” é uma celebração da criatividade e da expressão artística contemporânea. Com a participação de artistas como Guida Fonseca e Teresa Melo, o MAEDS reafirma-se como um espaço vital para a cultura em Setúbal. Não perca a oportunidade de visitar e de se deixar envolver por esta experiência que une arte, história e comunidade.",

    "text": "- supporto Réseau International Abbiamo bisogno di te da Nour Abou Eisha Martedì sera le autorità locali di Gaza hanno accusato Israele di aver rubato organi da corpi palestinesi, chiedendo un'indagine internazionale sulla questione. In una dichiarazione, l'ufficio stampa governativo con sede a Gaza ha affermato che l'esame dei corpi ha rivelato che le loro forme erano cambiate in modo significativo a causa del furto di organi vitali dai cadaveri. Ha aggiunto che l’esercito israeliano ha consegnato corpi non identificati alle autorità palestinesi e si è rifiutato di specificare dove sono stati ritrovati. La stessa fonte ha anche indicato che l'esercito israeliano ha ripetuto un simile atto durante la guerra in corso contro Gaza e ha anche riesumato i corpi dai cimiteri. Il comunicato critica ciò che dice”l’atteggiamento silenzioso delle organizzazioni internazionali che operano a Gaza, compreso il Comitato Internazionale della Croce Rossa, di fronte a un crimine così orribile commesso dall’occupazione (israeliana)'. Le autorità israeliane non hanno ancora commentato queste accuse. Martedì, le autorità israeliane hanno consegnato i corpi di dozzine di palestinesi uccisi dall’esercito israeliano e detenuti durante l’operazione di terra. Il Ministero della Sanità di Gaza ha ricevuto i corpi attraverso il valico di frontiera di Kerem Shalom nel sud della Striscia di Gaza, ha detto un corrispondente di Gaza.Anadolu sur le terrain. Il Ministero delle dotazioni e degli affari religiosi di Gaza è stato responsabile della loro sepoltura in fosse comuni, ha riferito il corrispondente. «L'ONU ci ha informato in anticipo dell'arrivo di un numero di martiri nella Striscia di Gaza, stimato in circa 80 corpi“, disse a Anadolu Marwan Al-Hams, direttore dell'ospedale Mohammed Yousef El-Najar della città di Rafah. «I corpi sono arrivati in un contenitore, alcuni intatti, altri invece erano a pezzi ed altri ancora decompostiHa aggiunto. fonte: [Agenzia Anadolu](https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/monde/les-autorit%C3%A9s-de-gaza-accusent-isra%C3%ABl-de-voler-les-organes-des-corps-de-palestiniens/3093341)",

    "text": "By Dave Higgens ,\n31 minutes ago Getty Images A cosmetic and weight loss clinic that secretly filmed patients is “not safe”, the health watchdog has found.\nA damning report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found that Doncaster-based Elements Medical was inadequate in every area it inspected in October, concluding it was “not safe”, “not effective” and “not well led”.\nThe clinic, which also operates online as The Virtual Slimming Clinic, offers services including weight management, pre and postoperative care for cosmetic and bariatric surgery , treatments for skin conditions including acne, and vitamin injections, the CQC said on Friday.\nAmong the long list of concerns, the report said: “We saw that people were covertly filmed at the premises including while receiving treatment, without their knowledge or consent.\n“In addition, the provider told us that the closed-circuit television monitoring (CCTV) was monitored and managed by a third-party provider which posed a safeguarding risk.”\nThe inspectors said they found a large quantity of the muscular injection Dysport in a fridge which was turned off during clinic times because it was noisy.\nThe report said: “Staff told us this medicine had been imported from Turkey, and we found labels on the medicine were not in English, however, the provider did not have a licence to import any medicines to England.\n“Turkey is also not an approved country for the purposes of supplying medicines for use in England by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).”\nThe report continued: “We also found the provider was using this injection in place of Botox, however, people using the service had not been informed of this.\n“We saw evidence that vials which were meant for single use only were being shared between multiple patients, which posed a significant infection risk.”\nThe inspectors also said that the firm bought the dilutant Bacteriostatic sodium chloride 0.9% from a website which said: “All products listed on this website are for research purposes only, we do not advocate or advise human use, and any such use is entirely at your own risk.”\nThey pointed to a series of other safety concerns, including obstructed fire exits, “lit candles in clinic and waiting rooms which were unattended for significant periods of time”, unsafely stored oxygen, and a defibrillator with no pads which left it “not usable in the event of an emergency”.\nThe report concluded that the provider showed “a disregard for the safety of staff and people using the service and staff, confidentiality, and information security”.\nIt said: “The CQC assessment team did not feel that all staff, including the provider, acted with openness, honesty and transparency during the inspection visit.\n“There was a disregard for the duty of candour. Where people had been placed at significant risk of harm by the service, we saw no evidence that they had been informed of this.”\nThe CQC said it did not inspect how caring or responsive the service was, as it focused on the areas of concern, and these areas both remain rated as good from the previous inspection.\nBeing placed in special measures means the service will be kept under close review by CQC, the watchdog said.\nAlan Stephenson, CQC deputy director of operations in the north, said: “When we inspected Elements Medical, we had serious concerns about the safety of the service and how it was being managed, to ensure people were getting the service and treatment they deserve.\n“We identified widespread shortfalls including people’s understanding of procedures and their consent to them, and how the service kept people safe from abuse.\n“Staff lacked basic knowledge of safeguarding procedures, including how to report concerns, and the service secretly filmed people during treatment without consent.”\nMr Stephenson said: “We have told Elements Medical where we expect to see rapid and widespread improvements and will continue to monitor them closely to keep people safe while this happens.\n“We will return to check on their progress and won’t hesitate to take further action if people are not receiving the care they have a right to expect.”\nThe report will be published on CQC’s website in the next few days.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#4](c4#c-4) Es una manera de verlo. Otra es que unos cuantos españoles se han marchado a países menos corruptos, han visto que se vive mejor así y evitan votar a los partidos que mantienen aquí niveles indecentes de corrupción.\nPero hay de todo…\n[#4](c4#c-4) te recomiendo algo más de fibra en tu dieta, parece que aún no has digerido el que no ganaran los tuyos\n[#4](c4#c-4) que yo conozca la gente que emigra a EEUU normalmente son gente con títulos superiores donde irse a América es muy buena opción laboral, y ya esta, si votan a la izquierda española sera porque ven desde fuera que es mejor opción.\nQue pasa con los que votan a la derecha?\nQue significaria?\nPor cierto a mayor nivel de estudios el votante de izquierda aumenta, tampoco dices nada de eso?\n[#37](c37#c-37) Ay pobres comunistas que el problema que tienen es que son dependientes de importar todo de EEUU.\nPues que sepas que la mayoría del pollo en Cuba viene de Miami, el embargo está hoy en día muy limitado.\nAh, y en la guerra fría había más gente en el bloque comunista que en el bloque capitalista.. y aun así al bloque capitalista le iba mil veces mejor y no necesitaban para nada a los comunistas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No veo relación entre el fanatismo religioso cristiano y los problemas político sociales en latinoamérica.\nEl Salvador es de los países más evangélicos, junto a Brasil, y las cosas les han empezado a ir bien.\nArgentina y Venezuela no son países de corte religioso evangélico y están comiendo mierda.\nEn Cuba ni religiosos son, y no tienen ni para comer mierda.\n[#33](c33#c-33) derecha y diosito van siempre juntitos, si te convenzo que estás en la tierra para sufrir a cambio de una recompensa cuando te mueras, aguantas mejor que te pisen, porque a mayor sufrimiento mayor recompensa\n[#33](c33#c-33) Simple, estos tipos se oponen al planamiento familiar.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449999/\n[#1](c1#c-1) por no hablar de que sus antepasados se arrancarían los pelos de desesperación por ver como han abrazado la religión que los masacró\nY los testigos de Jehová. Antes estaban a la salida de los hospitales con sus plafones. Ahora los veo en: la salida del metro, de los parques y en cualquier esquina o paseo. De 3 en 3. Si no les miras no te molestan, al menos en mi experiencia, pero me parece preocupante cómo van invadiendo el espacio público para su negocio de proselitismo religioso. ¿Puedo plantar un plafón con folletos de mi empresa 7 u 8 horas allá dónde me apetezca y abordar a los transeúntes?\n[#3](c3#c-3) al igual que llevan toda la vida ocupando espacio publico los mendigos, los que reparten folletos, los grupos de turistas guiados.... mientras la ocupacion no sea permanente, no hay problema\n[#3](c3#c-3) En mi pequeña ciudad de 40k habitantes el otro día me crucé a cuatro así, todos eran latinos. Les dije con palabras poco amables que se fueran con sus historias a su templo, que la calle no era lugar para ello. Eran muy ridículos, hablaban con una grandiosidad típica de pastor evangélico y que si la gloria de dios y mierdas así. Llamé a la policía. Me parece sumamente preocupante esto. Uno de ellos aún venía con ese falso buen rollo a \"debatir\" conmigo y me hacía preguntas de lo más ridículas. Largo de la calle por favor.\n[#21](c21#c-21) y que pasó cuando llamaste a la policía? Que te dijeron los guardias? conseguiste que se fueran?\n[#42](c42#c-42) Se fueron a la hora aproximadamente, pero no sé si por su propio pie o por la policía, ya que yo volví donde ellos media hora larga después y ahí seguían. La poli dijo que iba a mandar una patrulla y vi un coche una hora después de llamarles, pero capaz que iban a otro sitio, así que no puedo confirmar. Me olía que estos predicadores eran evangélicos pagados por alguien de aquí o de allá para hacer la ruta, porque el brasileño tenía un acento increíble y hablaba español justo.\n[#3](c3#c-3) pero esos, \"por fortuna\", son tan radicales que no van a ser mayoría nunca y hasta la fecha no se meten en política. Por lo demás, totalmente de acuerdo.\nYo lo llamaría \"fe seudocristiana\", porque muchas veces esto no está movido por una fe religiosa, sino que la fe religiosa es solo el medio para mover otra cosa, por ejemplo, mantener a la gente distraída odiando el aborto o a los homosexuales mientras no se dan cuenta de que otros se están quedando con la mayor parte de su esfuerzo al trabajar.\nLo peor es que muchos de esos nuevos templos se construyen en base a la necesidad de las gentes que acuden a ellos, aportan \"lo que no tienen\" y cuatro vividores y sus comparsas se hacen de oro. Para colmo, les adoctrinan con ideología neoliberal envuelta en el evangelio de \"san saduceo\" , que les promete la \"prosperidad\", sobre todo la material, demonizando todo sentido crítico que les haga pensar que ese sistema económico es el que les mantiene en la servidumbre y la desigualdad y del que muy pocos saldrán , que siempre son los que les piden el diezmo y lo que haga falta \"para el culto\", que no es otro que el que zarandea un libro con dorso dorado y una cruz desde el atril...\nLa religión era prácticamente la única cosa de LATAM que EEUU no controlaba, pero con el evangelismo es probable que en una década o dos reemplace al catolicismo en cantidad de seguidores.",
