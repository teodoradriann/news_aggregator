    "text": "TAMAQUA, Pa. — The Tamaqua Area School District has welcomed a new four-legged friend who does more than comfort students and faculty.\nJessica Paisley is a special education teacher at Tamaqua Area High School. When she adopted Breaker two years ago, she knew his rigorous training would make him a cherished member of her community. Tamaqua Area High School welcomed him with open arms.\n\"The primary goal is really to improve school culture and climate, and so for Breaker, just having him here completely changes the dynamic of some of our student's day,\" said Jessica Paisley, Breaker's Handler.\n\"It's fantastic. I look forward to finding Breaker every day. When I see him in the hallway, it's always a happy surprise. It's very different from last year, not having Breaker and this year having Breaker. It's completely different,\" said Julie Oaks, a sophomore at Tamaqua Area High School.\nWhile Breaker provides comfort and support to students and faculty, that's not all he can do.\n\"We're easily able to incorporate him into our curriculum as well,\" said Paisley.\nBreaker was involved in this follow-up lesson during a psychology class on what motivates people to do difficult things. Paisley showed the students what motivates Breaker to complete different tasks, how they can relate it to the lesson, and their own motivations.\nStudents volunteered to give Breaker treats after he followed different commands, like talking using a button. In addition to talking, Paisley says Breaker has also learned how to read. She can give him a set of commands written on paper, and Breaker completes them.\nPaisley says the school district received some grant money to expand breaker's training to help even more students.\n\"I think that because he's so versatile, he's able to just connect with the students on a different level than the rest of us here, and it gives them somebody to look forward to seeing every day,\" explained Paisley.\nClose Ad",

    "text": "商务部最新发布的数据显示，2024年中国服务贸易总额达到7.5万亿元人民币，同比增长14.4%，创历史新高。出口和进口分别增长18.2%和11.8%。在全球数字化、智能化和绿色化趋势的推动下，中国服务贸易规模扩大，结构优化，国际竞争力提升，显示出巨大的发展潜力。 李俊指出，过去一年中国放宽了过境免签政策并广受好评，“China Travel”在社交媒体上受到热捧。国内外游客对中国各地的文化景点如故宫、长城、张家界等以及城市漫步（Citywalk）的兴趣日益增加。他强调中国文化正散发出独特的东方魅力，并认为这将助力中国服务贸易持续扩展，并带动全球旅行服务业复苏繁荣。 此外，中国的数字文化内容与平台海外表现抢眼，《黑神话：悟空》游戏自发布以来便成为多平台销量冠军，并赢得多项大奖；网络视听内容通过Netflix、迪士尼+等海外流媒体广泛传播；网络文学也加快了出海步伐，在2023年有约62万部原创作品走向海外市场，吸引了超过2.3亿海外用户。 本文属于原创文章，如若转载，请注明来源： 《黑神话》驱动：游戏出口彰显中国文化服务全球影响力 https://game.zol.com.cn/968/9684357.html",
