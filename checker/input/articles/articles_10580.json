    "title": "Tony Khan uses WWE numbers to explain why AEW deserves ‘a big pay raise’ on next TV deal - Cageside Seats",
    "text": "AEW is negotiating terms for a new TV deal right now with its broadcast partner Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), at the same time that WWE is rumored to be seeking $400 million per year on its next TV deal for Raw. There’s actually a scenario where WWE Raw ends up on WBD, which [could spell disaster](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2023/12/14/24001238/report-wwe-raw-tv-deal-negotiations-wbd-warner-bros-cm-punk-return-zaslav-aew-forced-out-tony-khan) for All Elite Wrestling. On a call with the media today ahead of the Worlds End pay-per-view on Saturday night, AEW President Tony Khan was confident about continuing his current business relationship with WBD in 2024 and beyond, but also asserted there are “a lot of suitors” interested in AEW programming. When Khan was specifically asked by [Wrestlenomics’ Brandon Thurston](https://twitter.com/BrandonThurston) to explain AEW’s drop in TV ratings year-over-year, he focused on ratings for WWE Raw and AEW Dynamite being down a similar amount in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022: “You say Raw is down 8% and Dynamite’s down 10%...that’s very similar, and both of those are ahead of the decline in cable television. Cable television is down a lot more than 10% year-over-year. And both of us, Raw is down 8% and Dynamite down 10%, are beating the hell out of gravity. And both of us are looking at a big pay raise this year, for Dynamite and Raw. And Raw having made 265 million dollars a year last year, for them to get a pay raise, that’s gonna be a really big number for them. And for us, it’s a lot of money too.” ...Both shows are probably due for a big rights fee increase, and frankly percentage-wise, especially Dynamite because of where we started and how we performed...I think that both shows have done really well to, frankly defy gravity, and stay ahead of the drop, which as I understand is closer to 20%.” That’s a pretty sly move by Tony, anwering a question about AEW’s ratings drop to explain why AEW deserves a significant pay increase on its next TV deal. And he did so by putting AEW Dynamite in the same boat as WWE Raw, which most people understand will see a big money increase on its next TV deal. Does Tony Khan’s argument make sense to you, or is there a lot more to the story than just looking at Q4 numbers year-over-year? Let us know what you think in the comments below, Cagesiders.",

    "title": "Blue Origin Rocket Explodes And Implodes For Jeff Bezos",
    "text": "Jeff Bezos and his Blue Origin company have some catching up to do. The rocket company was contracted by NASA to build an orbital rocket, titled New Glenn, for the EscaPADE mission that is scheduled to launch in October. However, apparently, the team is facing some major setbacks in the development process, with an upper rocket portion failing and exploring during a recent stress test.\nUnder Pressure, Literally And Figuratively The Blue Origin team has a tight window to get the New Glenn orbital rocket ready to launch since the EscaPADE mission is sending two spacecraft to Mars and is hoping to take advantage of Earth and Mars alignment this year. The planets won’t be this close for another two years, so the October deadline is an ideal time for the mission to start. However, the upper rocket failing during the stress test isn’t the only problem, as another portion of the rocket imploded after engineers failed to put the necessary pressure-release valves in place before the New Glenn was moved from a humid outdoor hangar to an air-conditioned environment.\nCompounding Issues Complicate Upcoming Mission Explosions and implosions are the last thing you want to see when launching a rocket, so Blue Origin will definitely need to get these kinks ironed out as soon as possible. But based on these setbacks, it seems highly unlikely that the rocket is going to be set for a full-on mission by October. Additionally, the New Glenn is apparently four years behind schedule, so clearly these issues have been compounding for a while.\nBlue Origin’s Personnel Changes Amidst all of this testing chaos, Blue Origin has also made major moves internally, as a new CEO, David Limp, was appointed in December. Limp himself has made some big changes to the company’s executives and the company continues to rapidly make new hires. Despite all this, a spokesperson for Blue Origin did say that the team is working on assembling the rocket and that it’s still on track to launch New Glenn this year.\nRocket Lab Going Into Hero Mode Its possible missed launch for a NASA contract isn’t the only issue that Blue Origin has faced in recent years, as the company also had to shut down its New Shepard space tourism shuttle for over a year after an engine explosion occurred in September 2022. It remains to be seen if the space company can get through these obstacles and get it together in just a couple of months.\nRocket Lab, the company doing the building of the spacecraft, has said it’s going into “hero mode” to make the launch happen for what it’s worth, but a tight timeline is still a tight timeline.\nMay Have To Wait For The Next Mars Mission Blue Origin designed the New Glenn as a spacecraft that would be capable of taking satellites and people into Earth’s orbit, making it a competitor of other major space companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The EscaPADE mission is a big first test for this rocket, and its ultimate goal is to get two spacecraft to Mars to study the big red planet’s magnetic field. It’s possible that Blue Origin will make the cut, but it seems like it’s going to be down to the wire.\nSource: Bloomberg",

    "text": "The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday hailed the Supreme Court order granting interim bail to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, calling it the victory of truth even as he will remain in jail in the separate Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case in the excise policy matter.AAP general secretary Sandeep Pathak called the order historic and said the Supreme Court has demolished the so-called liquor scam by granting the bail. “Now the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] should close the case and not waste the time of the people. The BJP puts Opposition leaders in jail when it fails to defeat them in the elections.” Delhi minister Atishi said the judgement makes it clear that the investigation into the “fake excise” scam is just a conspiracy of the BJP. She maintained Kejriwal was arrested without evidence. “When the Rouse Avenue [trial] court gave bail to Arvind Kejriwal, it made it clear that the ED does not have any evidence against Kejriwal and that the ED is working with a bias against him. The Supreme Court has put its stamp on the Rouse Avenue court verdict.” Atishi said the BJP arrested Kejriwal through the CBI so that he can be kept in jail. “The interim bail makes it clear that Kejriwal is standing with truth and will continue to do so.” AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Modi, for how long will you keep the truth imprisoned by filing false cases? The whole country is watching your dictatorship. Be it...the Supreme Court, everyone believes that Kejriwal has been falsely implicated by ED. The decision of the Supreme Court is the victory of truth. Down with dictatorship,” Sanjay Singh said in a post on X.ED arrested Kejriwal on March 21 in its money laundering case related to alleged irregularities in the implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22. The Supreme Court granted interim bail to him on May 10 for campaigning in the Lok Sabha elections.The trial court granted Kejriwal bail on June 20 before the high court stayed it. The CBI arrested Kejriwal on June 26 at the Rouse Avenue Court complex.Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said that the interim bail does not mean that Kejriwal has been absolved of corruption. “. The matter is still under the consideration of the court,” said Sachdeva. BJP lawmaker Vijender Gupta said AAP is celebrating as if Kejriwal has been absolved. “Even in [murder cases], the accused get bail….”",

    "text": "A internação do papa Francisco e o agravamento de seu estado de saúde preocupa povos em todo o mundo.\nNas últimas horas, a Santa Sé emitiu comunicado informando que o sumo pontífice apresentava “quadro clínico complexo” que exigiria hospitalização adequada.\nEm Roma, o clima é de “tentar entender o que está acontecendo com o papa”, na opinião do padre Robson Caramano. O religioso da Diocese de São Carlos, está na capital italiana estudando mestrado em Filosofia.\n“Esse anúncio do Vaticano mudou todo o cenário, porque as internações dele já eram um pouco comuns, então agora com agravamento do quadro, o tornando complexo, muda um pouco as coisas”, afirmou.\nTestemunha do desenrolar da situação, padre Robson afirma que a saúde do papa já era uma preocupação entre os católicos nos últimos meses.\n“Desde às celebrações do final do ano passado já percebíamos aqui o Papa um pouco cansado. Recentemente, a presidência da Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil esteve com ele e, também, demonstrou preocupação com seu estado de saúde, porém afirmou que era de se admirar a maneira que ele se transformava quando era para expressar sua opinião”, ponderou o padre.\nSaúde frágil\nO papa Francisco está internado na Clínica Gemelli e deve ficar por lá ao menos durante toda a semana.\nEm boletim médico, o Vaticano informa que a situação se encontra estacionária e continua delicada.\nO papa está com infecção polimicrobiana no trato respiratório. A condição médica fez com que a equipe que faz o atendimento hospitalar mudasse o medicamento, em nova abordagem terapêutica.\nFique ON!\nQuer se manter bem informado no maior portal de notícias do interior de São Paulo?

Edmonton’s supporting cast grabbed the reins from their superstar captain Friday. Now the Oilers are one win from history. And the Panthers sit one loss from infamy. Zach Hyman scored his playoff-leading 16th goal and Stuart Skinner made 20 saves as Edmonton defeated Florida 5-1 on Friday to force Game 7. “The league’s too good,” Oilers centre Leon Draisaitl said. “You need depth, you need other guys to step up. We’ve had that throughout the run.” Warren Foegele, with a goal and an assist, and Adam Henrique provided the rest of the offence before Ryan McLeod and Darnell Nurse added empty netters for Edmonton, which has stormed back with three consecutive victories to tie the title series after going down 3-0. Used to seeing his name in bright lights, Draisaitl had just two assists in the series entering Game 6 before setting up Foegele’s opener as one of 11 players — none of them named McDavid — to find the scoresheet. “It’s been a hell of a story so far,” said the German, who was critical of himself Friday morning. “Really proud to give ourselves a chance.” Aleksander Barkov replied for the Panthers — a group that will head home searching for answers with their stranglehold on hockey’s holy grail having evaporated. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 16 shots. “We have good moments in the games,” said Barkov, whose team will host the winner-take-all finale Monday in Sunrise, Fla. “We gotta take those to the next game.” Edmonton is looking to become only the fifth team in NHL history to win a best-of-seven showdown after trailing 3-0 — and just the second in the Cup final, joining the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs. “The job is not done,” Hyman said. “Everybody will forget if we don’t finish it.” A win by the Oilers in the final game of the 2023-24 season would also mark the end to Canada’s 30-year Cup drought dating back to the 1993 Montreal Canadiens’ victory over Wayne Gretzky’s Los Angeles Kings. “We’ve been a pretty loose group,” Edmonton head coach Kris Knoblauch said. “It’s nice to be around this team … they’re having the time of their lives.” The orange-and-blue party around Rogers Place started in the hours before the 6 p.m. local time puck drop. Well-lubricated fans lined up for blocks around the arena for a spot in the outdoor viewing area. Others crowded bars and patios in the sunshine with their hockey team still playing on the second day of summer. One group drove an Oilers-themed Zamboni around the streets in the city’s downtown core. The raucous atmosphere inside the rink hit a fever pitch when the Oilers hit the ice, with the scoreboard sound meter touching 113.8 decibels ahead of the latest NHL game ever played in Canada during a non-pandemic season. “It means the world to us,” Draisaitl said of giving the home crowd a resounding sendoff. “I’ve been here for a long time and been through some pretty bad years. The people that were there tonight, they showed up every night. “To give them that is really special.” Edmonton — now 5-0 when facing elimination in these playoffs, including an 8-1 victory in Game 3 and a 5-3 triumph in Game 5 to stay alive thanks to consecutive four-point McDavid performances — opened the scoring at 7:27 of the first period when Draisaitl found Foegele for his third of the post-season. The Oilers went up 2-0 just 46 seconds into the second off a 2-on-1 that saw Mattias Janmark find Henrique before he settled the puck and ripped his fourth. Barkov fired past Skinner just 10 seconds later, but Knoblauch correctly challenged for offside. “The only hesitation was maybe there wasn’t the right video,” he said. “In my mind it was definitely offside, but I guess you never know.” The Oilers killed off a penalty later in the period — the 45th in the last 46 short-handed situations — before Skinner made a good stop off Barkov on a 2-on-1. Hyman put his team up by three with 1:40 left in the second when he took a pass from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and raced in on a breakaway and beat Bobrovsky to the backhand with his 70th overall including the regular season. The only other players with as many goals in a single post-season over the last 30 years are Joe Sakic (18 in 1996) and Pavel Bure (16 in 1994). Chants of “Ser-gei! Ser-gei!” rang around the cavernous building as the clock ticked down with the Oilers holding an 18-4 aggregate score over the Panthers since the third period of Game 3. Florida got on the board at 1:28 of the third when Edmonton couldn’t get the puck out and Barkov wove in front to slide his eighth past Skinner. Edmonton forward Derek Ryan then took a high-sticking penalty, but his teammates once again killed off the threat before McLeod and Nurse, with a primary assist from Skinner after a terrific save, scored into the empty net to spark wild scenes inside and outside Rogers Place. A team that climbed out of a regular-season hole that had them sitting 32nd in the overall standings before eventually going on a 16-game winning streak — and a pair of other long runs — the Oilers now head to South Florida sitting one win from hockey’s ultimate prize. “Game 7’s going to be my last game coaching this group,” Knoblauch said. “Some people are going to be moving on, that’s just the nature of the business. “It’s been a real pleasure.” There’s just 60 minutes — and perhaps more — to go.
