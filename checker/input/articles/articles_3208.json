    "text": "LONDON (March 15): Britain's Prince William said on Thursday his late mother Princess Diana would have been honoured to see a charity set up in her name doing \"inspirational work\" to support young people around the world.\nWilliam, 41, said his mother's legacy was something both he and his wife Kate, Princess of Wales, had sought to focus on through their work.\n\"I know that she would have been honoured to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe,\" the heir to the throne said in a speech at London's Science Museum where the ceremony was held.\n\"She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back, that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life,\" William added.\nThe Diana Award was set up 25 years ago in memory of King Charles' first wife, who was killed at the age of 36 in a 1997 car crash in Paris when William was 15 and his younger brother Harry was 12.\nThe charity's Legacy Award, which recognises young people for their social action of humanitarian work, was set up in 2017, with a ceremony held every two years.\nTwenty recipients from across the globe were honoured at Thursday's ceremony including three from Britain and the United States with other recipients coming from countries such as India, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Jamaica.\nThe ceremony comes in a week in which William's wife Kate, 42, apologised after her office issued a photograph she had edited of herself with the couple's three children.\nLeading news organisations, including Reuters, withdrew the picture after post-publication analysis showed it did not meet their editorial standards.\nThe picture had already attracted huge media attention as it was the first official photograph of Kate since she spent two weeks in hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery in January for a non-cancerous but unspecified condition, with her absence from royal duties sparking intense social media speculation.\nRoyal officials said she was not due to return until after Easter and has declined to give details, saying her health was a private matter.",

    "text": "Famosos Pedro Ferriz Híjar AMENAZA a Daniel Bisogno tras presunta difamación en VentaneandoA través de un vídeo compartido en redes sociales el periodista, Pedro Ferriz Híjar lanzó una amenaza en contra de Daniel Bisogno después de que el periodista del espectáculos lo acusará de infidelidad. Pedro Ferriz Híjar, amenaza, Daniel Bisogno, difamación, Ventaneando Quien se ha visto envuelto en el ojo del huracán es Daniel Bisogno, pues tras las preocupaciones por su estado de salud de nueva cuenta el periodista de espectáculos es foco de atención tras recibir una amanaza por parte de Pedro Ferriz Híjar. En redes sociales ha comenzado a circular un vídeo en el que Ferriz Híjar arremete en contra del conductor de Ventaneando por supuesta difamación de infidelidad. La difamación de infidelidad de la cual fue acusado Pedro Ferriz Híjar por parte de Daniel Bisogno se dio a conocer en el 2019, año en el que el conductor de Ventaneando hablo de esta situación en la que supuestamente Ferriz Híjar fue encontrado por su esposa en su cama acompañado de un travestí, tal cual lo menciona en este video a partir del minuto 3:33. Ante esta difamación Ferriz Híjar no se quedó callado y lanza una amenaza en contra de Bisogno. Esta difamación por parte de Daniel Bisogno se basa en algunas fotografías y audios que comprometen a Pedro Ferriz Híjar quien supuestamente sostuvo una relación fuera de su matrimonio con alguien de su trabajo, situación que el periodista Ferriz Híjar siempre ha negado y ha protegido su reputación. Ante esta situación Pedro aprovechó para mandar un mensaje a Ricardo Salinas Pliego el cual fue tomado como una amenaza hacia el conductor de Ventaneando. En este mensaje, Pedro Ferriz Híjar le pidió a Salinas Pliego tomar cartas en el asunto e incluso recalcó el hecho de cómo puede permitir que estos conductores hagan estos comentarios y sobre todo difamen a las personas: “Yo realmente le quiero mandar este video a mi querido amigo Ricardo Salinas; Ricardo, no puedes permitir que tus conductores digan este tipo de estupideces”, expresó Ferriz Híjar. Esta fue la amenaza que hizo pública Pedro Ferriz Híjar a Daniel Bisogno tras supuesta difamación en Ventaneando. Cabe mencionar que hasta el momento el conductor del programa de TV Azteca no se ha pronunciado al respecto y se ha mantenido callado respecto a esta situación, Incluso en redes sociales se ha mostrado muy activo por lo cual se espera haya una respuesta pronto a la amenaza de Ferriz Híjar.",

    "title": "Devil's Bend in Bramcote finally reopens after near 3-month closure - Nottinghamshire Live",
    "text": "The infamous Devil's Bend section of road on Chilwell Lane in Bramcote has reopened after being closed for nearly three months. A section of ancient wall collapsed into the road on April 6, while the road was closed for gas works. It was meant to reopen on April 18 but stayed shut due to the danger of more of the wall falling. Repairs finally started on May 6 after a lengthy investigation. A separate section of wall collapsed in February 2021 and was repaired swiftly. But on this occasion, the longer closure has allowed Nottinghamshire County Council teams to ensure that the wall is reinforced properly and protected from collapsing again. Get the latest news straight to your phone by joining us on WhatsApp Work involved strengthening the wall with concrete and making sure that concrete wasn't visible. It also involved making sure the new brickwork matched the remaining, centuries old brickwork. The job was initially touted to be completed by June 18 before a week-long delay was announced to allow National Grid to carry out works that had been planned for before the wall's collapse. The new scheduled reopening date was set for June 24. But the road has now finally reopened. Devil's Bend, near the corner of Town Street and Chilwell Lane, is a slaloming section of carriageway renowned by those in the immediate and surrounding areas. Its name comes from its reputation for being a tricky turn to make, with some even choosing to avoid the route altogether . The wall’s exact age is unknown, but it is depicted on some of the oldest Ordnance Survey maps of the area that have been found. It was likely cut into the sandstone which formed the bedrock of Nottingham and its surrounding areas and it is believed the upper and lower sections were built at separate times.",

    "title": "Moreno anuncia 6.000 profesionales más en Educación: varios sindicatos se descuelgan del acuerdo al considerarlo 'humo'",
    "text": "El presidente de la Junta de Andalucía, Juanma Moreno, ha presentado este jueves lo que ha calificado como un \"acuerdo histórico\" para el sistema educativo andaluz. Durante la sesión de control al Gobierno en el Parlamento autonómico, el líder del Ejecutivo andaluz desveló que la Consejería de Desarrollo Educativo ha firmado un pacto con los sindicatos CSIF, ANPE y UGT, que entrará en vigor en el curso 2025-2026 y contempla la incorporación de más de 6.000 profesionales, incluidos 2.500 docentes. Dos sindicatos ya han anunciado su rechazo al considerar este acuerdo \"humo\".\n\"Es una bonita noticia, una noticia positiva\", ha dicho Moreno en su respuesta a Adelante Andalucía, que llevó al Parlamento la situación de los docentes. Un acuerdo \"complejo\" en la mesa sectorial, pero que viene después de, ha dicho, años de acuerdos complejos.\nEste anuncio llega tan solo un día después de que la Junta informara sobre la aprobación del refuerzo de plantilla con 2.528 docentes para el próximo curso. El objetivo: mejorar la atención al alumnado con necesidades especiales, impulsar la Formación Profesional (FP) y reforzar la competencia digital. Una medida que supone una inversión de 130 millones de euros, parcialmente cofinanciada con fondos europeos. Igualmente, la Junta también anunciaba este miércoles un importante incremento salarial.\nEntre las \"medidas estructurales\" que ha señalamdo Moreno para el largo plazo, la Junta habla de una bajada de ratio a 22 alumnos por aula en el segundo ciclo de Educación Infantil, que comenzará a aplicarse a partir del segundo trimestre del curso 2028-2029. También se reforzará el apoyo a la diversidad en Primaria y Secundaria, especialmente en centros con ratios elevadas, y se incorporarán más especialistas en Educación Especial.\nEl acuerdo también incluye acciones para reducir la burocracia, una exigencia recurrente de los sindicatos firmantes, y la recuperación de la convocatoria de acceso a Cátedras en los cuerpos docentes de Secundaria. “Es una bonita noticia, una noticia positiva”, dijo Moreno, quien elogió la disposición al diálogo de los sindicatos implicados y calificó el pacto como un “hito” que permite “rediseñar el sistema”.\nRechazo de Ustea y CCOO\nSin embargo, no todo el sector sindical aplaude la medida. Ustea, uno de los sindicatos más representativos en educación pública, ha rechazado firmar el acuerdo y ha cargado con dureza contra su contenido y su proceso de negociación. En un comunicado, denuncian que el texto \"no responde a las necesidades reales\" y critican que muchas de las medidas estén supeditadas a fondos europeos “sin garantías de continuidad”. También acusan a la Junta de haber negociado de forma opaca y excluyente.\nUsteainsiste en que el acuerdo “no garantiza un aumento estructural de plantilla, ni una bajada inmediata de ratios, ni una reducción real del horario lectivo”. Además, lamenta la exclusión de etapas educativas como la FP, las enseñanzas artísticas o de régimen especial. Según su portavoz, Fran Fernández, el sindicato “no puede legitimar lo insuficiente” y responsabiliza a la Consejería de querer vincular este acuerdo a un decreto que “elimina recursos consolidados”.\nCCOO también se ha desmarcado del acuerdo y ha acusado a la Consejería de querer “lavarse la cara” tras un año académico que califican de desastroso. El sindicato denuncia que muchas de las plazas ya estaban anunciadas previamente y que se trata de un documento sin compromisos firmes. \"Ni bajan ratios, ni reducen horarios ni mejoran la atención al alumnado NEAE\", sentencian.\nAmbas organizaciones, USTEA y CCOO, coinciden en señalar que este acuerdo “solo sirve a intereses propagandísticos” del Gobierno andaluz y que no representa un avance real para la comunidad educativa. Desde USTEA, llaman a mantener la movilización social y recuerdan que las pocas mejoras logradas han sido fruto de la presión colectiva.",
