    "text": "NEW DELHI: Delhiites breathed the cleanest air since Sept 11 last year, as the air quality index (AQI) dipped to 61 in the 'satisfactory' category on Thursday. A lower AQI than this was seen on Sept 11 when it was 53. Rain, along with strong winds, cleaned the air.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory, said, \\\"Rain is the cause for the low AQI. However, it doesn't mean that the air pollutants have disappeared. It is a common phenomenon that rain washes everything away; that's the beauty of the sub-tropical region. However, when there will be no rain, the pollution will bounce back.\\\" He added, \\\"To reduce the emissions, everyone has to work throughout the year.\\\"Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, \\\"This is very typical of the monsoon season. Consistent and prolonged rain has a washout effect that cleans up the air. In seasonal comparison, monsoon months are usually the cleanest.\\\"The Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that Sept 2023 had witnessed nine 'satisfactory' days and one 'good' day when the AQI touched 45 on Sept 10.Oct last year saw one 'satisfactory' day with an AQI of 89 on Oct 17. However, no 'satisfactory' day was seen from Oct 18, 2023, to June 26 this year.The first 'satisfactory' day of the year was recorded on June 27 with an AQI of 79. No 'good' air day has been seen in 2024 till now.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain 'satisfactory' until July 7 and then for subsequent six days, it may stay in the 'satisfactory' to 'moderate' category.",

    "title": "Scientists discover 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica",
    "text": "Scientists have discovered a long-lost ancient river system beneath the Antarctic ice sheets. The giant river system, estimated to be around 40 million years old, could shed light on the effects of climate change. The river first caught the attention of scientists in 2017 while drilling into the western part of Antarctica to collect samples from soft sediments and hard rocks set within the frozen seabed. PexelsFormed in two different periodsDuring the drilling, they found sediments with layers from two different periods. The lower part contained fossils, spores and pollens, indicating that a temperate rainforest existed during the mid-Cretaceous period, about 85 million years ago. Also read: Antarctic Ice Sheets Are Capable Of Melting Much Faster Than Previously ThoughtThe upper part of the sediment contained mostly sand. As the scientists delved into these samples from the mid-to-late Eocene epoch, about 30 million to 40 million years ago, they found a strongly stratified pattern that resembled something that would normally come from a river delta.Patterns from river delta More research concluded that an ancient river once flowed in the Antarctic region. According to the study, the basic climatic conditions for the formation of permanent ice only prevailed in the coastal regions of the East Antarctic Northern Victoria Land.Also read: Antarctica's Largest Iceberg Is Going To Melt At The Equator After 18 Years PexelsSecond layer formed later\\\"It wasn't until about seven million years later that conditions allowed for advance of an ice sheet to the West Antarctic coast,\\\" explains Hanna Knahl, a paleoclimate modeler at the AWI. \\\"Our results clearly show how cold it had to get before the ice could advance to cover West Antarctica that, at that time, was already below sea level in many parts.\\\"Help how climate evolvedJohann Klages from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, who led the research said that the discovery of the river could help in the study of Earth's climate conditions. \\\"If we think about a potentially severe climate change in the future, we need to learn from periods in Earth's history where this already happened,\\\" he said.For more news and current affairs from around the world, please visit Indiatimes News.",

    "text": "Black Bears Look to Slay Titans and Stay Red Hot\nJanuary 16, 2025 - North American Hockey League (NAHL)Maryland Black Bears News Release\nMaryland's offense came to play this past weekend, as the Black Bears scored 11 goals in two games to wrap up a hard-fought, gritty series sweep of the New Hampshire Mountain Kings to remain in the top three in the East Division. But the standings are crowded at the top, and to stay in the top three Maryland will need to take care of business against a team hot on their tail, the New Jersey Titans. The Titans are set to host the Black Bears with an 18-13-5 record and 41 points, sitting fourth in the East Division.\nThe Black Bears' sweep of the Mountain Kings was not an easy one. Game one started off well, with forwards Sebastian Speck and Kareem El-Bashir striking in the first period for an early 2-0 Maryland lead. Returning Black Bears forward Matthew Croxall scored a goal early in the second period, making it 3-0. However, New Hampshire would quickly climb back in the game, getting two power play goals from defenseman Damon Bossie just minutes apart to see the lead dwindle to 3-2. Black Bears forward Tanner Duncan got one goal back later in the frame, getting a sweet pass from forward Isac Nielsen from the far side of the slot to make it 4-2. New Hampshire responded with a two-on-one goal to make it 4-3 later in the frame, but Duncan would respond quickly with another goal from the slot to make it 5-3. Mountain Kings forwards Kim Hilmersson and Jaden Davis would go on to tie the game in the third period at 5-5, but Croxall would not allow his team to falter, scoring a power play goal less than a minute after the Mountain Kings tied the game with a wrist shot from the near circle to make it 6-5. Maryland forward and captain Tyler Stern would ice the game with an empty net goal for a 7-5 final.\nGame two saw another strong start for Maryland, with Isac Nielsen scoring on a rebound just under two minutes into the game, followed by a slap shot goal from the point on the power play from defenseman Dylan Gordon for a 2-0 lead after one. But once again, New Hampshire responded with goals from forwards Oli Genest and Frank D'Ancona to tie the game at 2-2 in the second period. Hilmersson scored early in the third period to give the Mountain Kings a 3-2 lead, but it was short-lived as Black Bears forward Riley Fast let a wicked wrist shot go from the high slot to tie the game 3-3. Less than five minutes later, Tanner Duncan would slam home a pass from forward Harrison Smith in the slot on the power play to give Maryland a 4-3 lead they would not relinquish.\nNew Jersey hosted the Northeast Generals last weekend in a similarly high-scoring affair, with this series being split 1-1. Game one saw the Titans start of strong with goals from forwards Jack Hillier and Nikita Meshcheryakov for a 2-0 lead in the first period. New Jersey yielded a goal early in the second period only for forward Nikolai Meshkantsov to respond to make the score 3-1. The Generals wouldn't go down easy, as they scored two quick goals to tie the game at 3-3. However, Titans forward Owen Leahy's goal late in the second period would regain New Jersey the lead 4-3. Despite allowing a late goal by Northeast to make it 5-4, New Jersey would hold on for the win. Game two was not as kind to the Titans. After allowing the first goal of the game, New Jersey would respond with a three-goal second period with forwards Ryan Novo, Owen Leahy, and Alex Papaspyropoulos responding to a Generals goal for a 3-2 lead heading into the third period. However, Northeast came out swinging and scored four goals in the third period to win the game 6-3. The offense has driven New Jersey all season, with the teams' 126 goals the third-most in the East Division.\nThese two teams met back in December for a series at Piney Orchard Ice Arena with each team recording a win. The Titans took the first game on the back of a three-goal third period for a 5-3 win. Maryland won the second game thanks to a two-goal performance from defenseman Victor Mannebratt and an overtime winner from Kareem El-Bashir in a 4-3 win.\nPlayers to Watch\nJack Hillier (F, NJT): Hillier is second in the NAHL in points with 50 and is tied for first in assists with 36 helpers. He has been instrumental in New Jersey's offensive success, recording 16 points in his last ten games.\nTanner Duncan (F, MYD): Duncan has been lights out the last three games, scoring five goals, including the game-winning goal this past Saturday. He has scored seven points in four of his last six games, with three of those games being multi-point performances.\nMaryland Black Bears Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the North American Hockey League message board...\nNorth American Hockey League Stories from January 16, 2025\nWeekend Preview Versus Northeast- Danbury Jr. Hat TricksJack Spicer Heads to Sacred Heart University- Lone Star BrahmasBlack Bears Look to Slay Titans and Stay Red Hot- Maryland Black BearsWilderness, Steel to Meet in Home/Home Series- Minnesota Wilderness\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",
