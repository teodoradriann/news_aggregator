    "text": "【大纪元2025年05月08日讯】（大纪元记者Matthew Vadum报导／张纯之编译）5月6日，联合起诉加州的各州检察长们表示，作为法律和解的一部分，加州同意撤销其电动卡车强制令。该命令强制要求卡车公司淘汰内燃机卡车，改用电动卡车。\n加州原定于2036年全面禁止销售内燃机卡车，但批评者说，由于加州经济规模位居全美第一，该禁令将迫使全美的卡车电动化。此前，受加州政策影响，许多州已经效仿加州的车辆法规框架。\n在“内布拉斯加州诉克里夫案”（Nebraska v. Cliff）中，来自内布拉斯加、俄克拉荷马及美国其它15州的检察长起诉加州空气资源委员会（CARB）制定的《先进清洁车队法规》（Advanced Clean Fleets）。\n这项法规原本规定，在加州营运的部分卡车公司，必须淘汰现有的内燃机车辆，改用价格更高、效能较低的电动卡车。\n根据5月5日加州东区联邦地方法院提交的命令，加州已同意启动程序撤回这项难以实施的电动卡车强制令──除非加州的《清洁空气法》能获得美国环保署（EPA）的豁免。\n内布拉斯加州检察长麦克·希尔格斯（Mike Hilgers）表示：“这项和解对内布拉斯加物流业、消费者和法治都是重大胜利。”\n俄克拉荷马州检察长根特纳·德拉蒙德（Gentner Drummond）也指出：“这是自由市场的胜利。”加州的规定将对商业卡车行业带来巨额成本，并对消费者产生深远影响。\n根据法院文件，CARB人员必须在今年10月31日前，将撤销条款提交至董事会进行公开听证会。如果获得通过，则必须于2026年8月31日前正式提出撤销《先进清洁车队法规》的立法行动。在此期间，加州不得执行相关禁令。各州诉讼程序也将暂缓，并于法规正式撤销后15天内撤回诉讼。\n目前，美国最高法院也正在审理能源公司针对加州车辆排放标准提起的诉讼案（Diamond Alternative Energy v. EPA），预计将于6月底前裁决。◇\n责任编辑：方平",

    "text": "Dubai: Consumers in the UAE will get an extra layer of protection now that the UAE Central Bank has issued new guidelines for Buy Now Pay Later companies to be licensed and operate in this market.\nThe biggest break that consumers will get from this would be protection from getting into ‘over-indebtedness’ or being a prey to ‘predatory practices’. That’s something regulators in the UAE – and also in Saudi Arabia – have built into the defences with the new rules.\nThe Buy No Pay Later (or BNPL as it’s more popularly known) movement struck a chord with consumers in the Gulf in the immediate phase of the Covid outbreak. Consumers had turned to caution on their spending habits, and when BNPL options came up with the promise of 0 per cent interest rate, they were willing to give it a good try.\nIn most such transactions, consumers only had to pay a processing fee to get the spread out payment option. Many of these deals would also offer one- or two-month grace period before the first payment was due\nThe BNPL regulations further aim to protect consumers from potential predatory practices, encourage responsible lending and stimulate long-term industry growth by attracting well-funded players - Arun Leslie of Century Financial Since then, BNPL purchases have mushroomed, across categories such as electronics and mobile gadgets and even more regular purchases. The category had another burst of strong growth once interest rates shot up, and consumers felt more comfortable with the 0 per cent rate on their purchases, and which are then paid off in 6 months or so.\nNew and smaller BNPL firms need to show financial resources The biggest names in the UAE and Gulf's Buy Now Pay Later fintech space have pulled ample funds over the last 3 years to ensure smooth operations. It is the small or new entrants that will need to show they have the resources to take their place in the marketplace, under the new UAE Central Bank rules. “It was fine when the purchases were for a Dh2,500 phone or a Dh4,000 smart TV – but the ‘pay later’ movement was offering choices on bigger purchases,” said a banking industry source. “Consumers need to be aware of the cost to them when they buy a Dh20,000 diamond jewellery through BNPL. The 0 per cent interest is not the only criterion that matters.\n“And rightly so, the UAE regulator moved in with tougher requirements on who can offer BNPL schemes.\n“This is a major moment to safeguard consumers from piling up too high a debt – even if it’s done at 0 per cent interest.”\nGood for the BNPL industry too Arun John is Chief Market Analyst at Dubai-based Century Financial, and he too flagged consumer protection as the outcome from the latest Central Bank announcement.\n“The regulations promote market fairness by establishing a level playing field with minimum standards and licensing requirements,” said John.\nOffering short-term credit – and this is essentially the core of BNPL – has now extended to multiple consumer realms. There were offers on cars, airline tickets, resort stays – in fact, wherever these promoters felt consumers could be persuaded with a BNPL option.\n“Beneath the alluring veneer lies a complex ecosystem demanding closer scrutiny,” said Yusuf Mansawala - Chief Market Analyst CPT Markets. “On the down side, this could mean:\nDebt avalanche: The ease of BNPL transactions can fuel impulsive spending, leading to uncontrolled debt accumulation, particularly for individuals struggling with financial discipline. Late fees and compounding penalties further exacerbate the risk. Hidden costs: While advertised as interest-free, BNPL often carries hefty late fees and charges that can negate any initial savings. Responsible usage and understanding repayment terms are crucial.” What does the UAE Central Bank require? The regulatory requirements put out are clear – BNPL entities can operate as ‘agents’ of licensed Banks or finance companies once they receive approval from the Central Bank.\nThey can also carry out such activity after getting a license to be ‘Restricted License Finance Companies’.\n“Unlicensed entities which carry on any form of short-term credit activity and intend to continue to carry on these activities, must either apply to the CBUAE to be licensed as a Restricted Licence Finance Companies - or partner with a licensed finance company or a bank,” the regulator added.\nHaving a bank involved essentially widens the safety net for the consumer. The bank essentially acts as ‘guarantor’ to what the BNPL offers promise.\nBNPL offers have captivated consumers and merchants alike, surging through the fintech landscape with its promise of instant gratification and interest-free financing. - Yusuf Mansawala of CPT Markets Loan approval Stricter processes must also be in place at the finance companies on loan approvals.\n“To review and approve substantial loans, the board of directors is encouraged to establish a ‘credit committee’ of no fewer than three members,” the UAE Central Bank now mandates.\n“Significant loans must be reviewed and approved by the board of directors. Finance companies must decide on the definition of substantial and significant loans individually, based on the size of the finance company and its scope of activities.”\nBanks as loan provider - and partner But the presence of established local banks in customer interface is the standout feature.\n“Banks, with established customer trust and financial infrastructure, can integrate BNPL services into their platforms,” said John.\n“This move can enhance customer engagement, loyalty, and competitive advantage, especially appealing to tech-savvy demographics. Such partnerships can mitigate potential risks.\n“Various collaboration models between BNPL and banks - such as direct integration, co-branded products, and referral partnerships - offer flexibility.”",
