    "text": "AZ lawmakers advance bill to create partisan school board races Republican lawmakers advanced a bill that would make nonpartisan school board races partisan. And the bill’s sponsor says she wants even more elections to feature politically partisan candidates. [Senate Bill 1097 would require school board candidates to disclose their party affiliation ](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/SB1097P.pdf)to voters — something school officials, like the Arizona School Boards Association, and legislative Democrats oppose. But Sen. Justine Wadsack (R-Tucson) says she wants to take the idea even further because it lets voters make more informed decisions. “We should have partisan, maybe, partisan judges, maybe we should do partisan everybody, because right now the world is split, I think, and you have people that want to live their lives by one ideology and others that want to live by another, and they get to choose,” Wadsack said. “Where they want to be where they want to live where they send their children, which fire district they go to; all of that is determined by political ideology,” she said, later adding that city elections should also be partisan. Barry Aarons, a lobbyist for the Arizona Association of County School Superintendents, said that the bill would unnecessarily polarize local elections. “If you have a partisan designation it restricts you because you become slavishly devoted to your partisan base, and it restricts you on coming up with consensus on issues and school board issues should be consensus issues not partisan battlegrounds,” he said. [A similar measure sponsored by former GOP lawmaker Michelle Ugenti-Rita](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/SB1010P.pdf) failed to clear its first hearing vote in 2022, when then Republican Sen. Tyler Pace voted against the bill alongside Democrats. Wadsack’s version of the bill passed its first hearing Wednesday on party lines. It is co-sponsored by the Senate president and seven other Republicans. Democrats who voted against SB 1097 raised the issue of replacing school board members. In partisan elections, if the office holder leaves their position for any reason, their appointed replacement must be from the same political party. Sen. Christine Marsh (D-Phoenix) said she’s concerned that adding party affiliation to the school board candidates would further narrow the pool of replacements if an elected member leaves office. There are more than 200 Arizona school districts, and Sen. Ken Bennett (R-Prescott) said sometimes it’s difficult to field enough candidates, especially in rural areas. “Sometimes you’re looking for a warm body to replace someone,” Bennett said. Wadsack disagreed. She said the vacancy issue is just “the possibility of something that might happen” and not something that should impact lawmaking, especially since parents in her experience are more engaged than usual in school board activity. Wadsack said that partisan school board elections in other states lead to higher turnout, citing a conservative think tank. The Foundation for Government Accountability [released a study in 2023 on North Carolina,](https://thefga.org/research/north-carolina-evidence-school-board-candidates-party-affiliation/) where there are both partisan and nonpartisan school board elections. Chris Kotterman with the Arizona School Board Association said it makes sense that voters would select whatever candidate matches their party all the way down the ballot, but said that’s not necessarily a good thing. He called partisan elections “bruising affairs” that he doesn’t want to subject the candidates to. “I don’t think extending that level of rancor downward is an appropriate solution to the problem,” Kotterman said.",

    "text": "Stuarts Draft Farm thankful for rainfall STUARTS DRAFT, Va. (WHSV) - Augusta County produce farm says the recent rain has been a blessing. Cassidy Fitzgerald, Co-owner of Simply Rooted Farm said the farm has not had much moisture and the rain that came has helped. Co-owner Madison Davis said there was only a little bit of wind damage. “Luckily, we didn’t have too much wind damage if any at all, it blew over some sunflowers and maybe a couple corn plants but nothing too harmful,” Davis said. Davis and Fitzgerald said the dry weather has not been good for fruit production or fruit health. Davis added that even the plants that prefer dryer weather were not getting enough moisture. ”We grow a ten-acre field by hand, and we have no way to irrigate so we are thankful for this now,” Davis said. While getting too much rain can cause damage to the crops, other than a few baby corn plants that were covered, the rain has caused more good than bad. Simply Rooted Farm’s main crop right now is sweet corn, which typically grows better with about an inch of rain per week, which it hasn’t been getting, Davis said. Copyright 2024 WHSV.

    "text": "Sarah Michelle Gellar has handled vampires, werewolves and more on screen with ease, but off screen, protecting her two kids is harder when they have so much technology at their fingertips. “There’s parts of [technology] that are great, and there are parts of it that aren’t,” Gellar, 46, told Us Weekly while promoting her partnership with UScellular for the Global Day of Unplugging, which is on Friday, March 1. “I love the idea that I know where they are at all times because it shows up on my phone. I took two crosstown buses in New York City to get to school. My mom had no idea where I was, and I can’t even imagine what that must’ve been like for her.” The Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum shares daughter Charlotte, 14, and son Rocky, 11, with her husband of nearly 22 years, Freddie Prinze Jr. The pair set strict rules for their kids when it comes to internet access and their devices, but that doesn’t mean just restricting screen time as a whole. “Look, we had rain for five days. What do I expect these kids to do?” Gellar said. “I want to be realistic with them about their time.” See Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Get in the Spooky Spirit That means establishing some guidelines. Gellar said that their kids first have to wait until finishing elementary school to get their own phone. “You have to graduate lower school to get your phone, so my son actually will be getting his phone in June,” Gellar explained to Us. “He does not have one yet. He has an iPad for travel and stuff like that.” The Do Revenge star also takes full advantage of the parental controls when she lets one of her children use a tablet or phone, monitoring how many hours they spend in front of the screen and what they’re looking at. “We can’t expect kids to be able to self-regulate, right? That’s something that we’re still learning how to do [as adults],” she said. Though Gellar can control the devices she buys for their kids, she can’t control other kids and their phones — which can lead to some awkward situations. Gellar was shocked when one of Rocky’s friends with a phone once showed him something on the internet about her. ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ Cast: Where Are They Now? “It was actually my son one day who came home and said, oh, so-and-so has a phone or something.

    "title": "Nicarágua expulsa sete sacerdotes para o Vaticano - ISTOÉ Independente",
    "text": "08/08/2024 - 18:11 O governo da Nicarágua anunciou, nesta quinta-feira (8), que enviou ao Vaticano sete sacerdotes que, segundo a oposição, haviam sido detidos na semana passada, em meio a uma nova onda de prisões de religiosos da Igreja Católica. “Ontem, quarta-feira, 7 de agosto, partiram da Nicarágua para Roma sete sacerdotes nicaraguenses, que chegaram bem e foram recebidos pela Santa Sé”, disse a esposa do presidente Daniel Ortega e vice-presidente, Rosario Murillo, ao ler um comunicado. Os sacerdotes enviados ao Vaticano são Edgar Sacasa, Ulises Vega, Marlon Velázquez, Víctor Godoy, Harvin Torres, Jairo Pravia e Silvio Romero, segundo relatórios do portal digital *El Confidencial*, crítico do governo de Ortega e editado na Costa Rica. Os sete faziam parte de um grupo de 13 religiosos que foram detidos ou colocados em prisão domiciliar pela polícia nicaraguense há uma semana em Matagalpa, no norte do país, de acordo com o Coletivo Nicaragua Nunca Más. Não houve nenhum relatório sobre os outros padres detidos, nem por parte do governo nem da oposição. Ortega e Murillo sustentam que a Igreja apoiou os protestos de 2018 contra o governo, os quais deixaram mais de 300 mortos, segundo a ONU, e considerados por Manágua uma tentativa de golpe de Estado patrocinada por Washington. Murillo chamou os religiosos de “filhos do demônio” ou “agentes do mal” que fazem “terrorismo espiritual”. “Várias paróquias foram cercadas e pelo menos 12 sacerdotes foram detidos arbitrariamente, alguns deles com paradeiro desconhecido e em situação de desaparecimento forçado”, disse o coletivo após as detenções. O governo de Ortega, no entanto, não se referiu às prisões e nem classificou o envio dos sete sacerdotes ao Vaticano como expulsão. – “Crucificados” – O jornalista nicaraguense Emiliano Chamorro, exilado nos Estados Unidos, indicou na rede social X que “a Igreja Católica está sendo crucificada pelo casal ditador”, em referência a Ortega e Murillo. Ele questionou o silêncio dos bispos e cardeais que ainda estão na Nicarágua diante das novas expulsões. “Enquanto a ditadura de Daniel Ortega desterrava 7 dos 13 sacerdotes sequestrados, os bispos da Conferência Episcopal estavam reunidos em Manágua, mas como de costume, não houve uma carta pastoral ou comunicado sobre a situação do país”, acrescentou Chamorro em sua publicação. Há uma semana, um grupo de especialistas das Nações Unidas denunciou que o governo da Nicarágua mantém ataques “sistemáticos” contra a Igreja Católica e outras confissões cristãs desde os protestos de 2018. De abril de 2018 até março de 2024, o grupo constatou “73 casos de prisões arbitrárias de membros da Igreja Católica e de outras confissões cristãs”, embora tenha afirmado que “o número total pode ser ainda maior”. O governo de Ortega libertou em janeiro dois bispos católicos, incluindo Rolando Álvarez, e outros religiosos, e os enviou para Roma.",

This game not only revolutionized what players thought RPGs could do back in the day, but also set a precedent for any titles that followed it. Unlike other games on this list, Skyrim not only presents players with game mechanics that allow them to play as Rogues by using stealth, but also offers them different potions, armor, and skills to be able to walk past most enemies undetected. The lockpicking mechanics are also extremely fun, and if players spend enough skill points on them, they'll be able to open any chest in seconds. Players can also steal from merchants and pickpocket guards, which isn't always recommended, but can often be a great source of income. All in all, Skyrim presents one of the best open worlds to make a Rogue build and play as one.

At the height of the storm, winds were gusting up to 50 mph, bringing down trees and power lines.\nThe Brief An early evening potent storm system blew through the region, dumping copious amounts of rain. At the height of the storm, winds were gusting up to 50 mph, bringing down trees and power lines. NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. - Delaware County was not spared from the early evening storm system that saw a variety of issues, including heavy rain and damaging wind gusts that took down trees and power lines.\nWhat we know:\nDaniel McCarthey arrived to his Newtown Square home from work to a large tree down in the front yard and no power.\nHis wife, who was at home at the time, texted him pictures just before 2 p.m.\nMcCarthy said his wife heard a loud rumble of thunder and then a loud bang and went outside to find the tree down.\nWhat they're saying:\n\"I was like, ‘What does she need, Oh my god, what's that?’\" McCarthy described what happened. \"Lightning struck the tree and, fortunately, it fell away from the house, not towards the house.\"\nHe added, \"PECO was quick to respond. Police were quick to respond. Everyone got out real quick.\"\nDig deeper:\nThe couple just renovated the home and only moved in in January. They are actually relieved they are only dealing with no power.\nMcCarthy said, \"If I get it back by this time tomorrow, I'll be a happy camper. What can you do, really?\"\nBig picture view:\nNeighbor Stephen Fay is taking the outage in stride, but admits he was a little worried about all the wires on the ground, \"So we have a wire that's on our driveway. We're not seeing any sparks or anything, just to double check there's no worries about the power being on but talked to the guys. Power was off so everything is safe.\"\nIn all 11 homes are in the dark, with PECO crews on site working to restore service.",
