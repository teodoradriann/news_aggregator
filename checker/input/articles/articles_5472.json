The musical titled ‘Not Forgotten’ a musical theatre adaptation of the crucifixion of Christ has a 90-member crew, including 50 cast members. \"The crucifixion story never fails to tug at heartstrings, but here’s a brand new interpretation of the timeless story, exploring what was going on in the mind of the Father God, while Jesus was being mocked, flogged and nailed to the cross?\" the All People’s Church said in a note. The original script comprises five acts, 12 scenes, two original songs, five familiar worship songs, innovative sets, lights and sound design, an LED wall, a live band and singers. Opening with the infamous ‘Judas kiss’ betrayal scene the musical looks at the ‘Lazarus come out!’ scene, Pilate’s courtyard torture scene, a 'Trinity Talk’ scene on why heaven was silent. The play ends with a resurrection and celebration. The shows are scheduled at 6.30 pm on Saturday (March 30) and at 10.30 am on Sunday (March 31) at the St Joseph’s College of Law Auditorium, Field Marshal Cariappa Road, Ashok Nagar.

    "text": "Josh Allen, Bills dispatch Steelers 31-17 in playoff game delayed a day by snow. Chiefs up next ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — It made no difference to Josh Allen what day or time the Buffalo Bills faced the Pittsburgh Steelers. The AFC wild-card playoff game could’ve been played Sunday as scheduled, in the midst of a lake-effect storm that dumped more than 2 feet of snow on the region, and the Bills were going be to ready. ADVERTISING They proved that on Monday, when Allen threw three touchdown passes and scored on a franchise playoff-record 52-yard touchdown run as Buffalo beat Pittsburgh 31-17 in a game that was postponed by 27 1/2 hours. “People keep saying that’s what we wanted. We had no call in that,” Allen said about the postponement. “We would have played yesterday, would have played Saturday would have played Friday, it wouldn’t have mattered. We would have come out here and played when we were told to play.” The game turned into a celebration of the elements. Snow blanketed a majority of the seats inside Highmark Stadium when the gates opened and was put to good use by fans, who tossed handfuls into the air like confetti to celebrate. “We put on a show in the snow,” left tackle Dion Dawkins said. “We’re here. We got one more week.” The second-seeded Bills (12-6), who closed the regular season with five straight wins, advance to host Patrick Mahomes and the No. 3 seed Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round on Sunday night. Buffalo and its fans have longed for a home playoff game against the Chiefs after their 2020 and ‘21 seasons ended with playoff losses at Kansas City. “We’re a step behind already,” Allen said, noting the Chiefs will have two more days of rest after beating Miami on Saturday. “It’s going to take a team effort. We know the type of team that they are, obviously the type of quarterback that they have in Pat over there.” Buffalo led 21-0 before Pittsburgh scored on three straight possessions to get within 24-17. Allen then sealed the win, throwing a 17-yard touchdown pass to Khalil Shakir with 6:27 remaining. Shakir caught the pass at the 10 over the middle, slipped Minkah Fitzpatrick’s tackle attempt with a spin move, and outraced the rest of the Steelers defenders into the end zone. “Dude hit me and I was able to just stay up and make a play from there,” Shakir said. “But that comes down to (Allen) getting the ball, putting it right on the money and giving me an opportunity to make a play.” Allen finished 21 of 30 for 203 yards and ran for 74 yards on eight carries, becoming the first quarterback in NFL playoff history to throw three or more TD passes while rushing for 70 or more yards and a score. He didn’t have a turnover for just the fourth time this season. Mason Rudolph threw two touchdown passes with an interception in his first playoff start for the Steelers (10-8), but Pittsburgh was too inconsistent on either side of the ball to keep up with Allen and the Bills. The Steelers lost their fifth straight playoff game; the franchise’s most recent postseason victory was exactly seven years ago. Missed tackles, two turnovers that led to 14 points for Buffalo and the Bills’ ability to bottle up the Steelers’ running attack contributed to the loss. “I’m appreciative of the efforts. But it’s not mystical. We didn’t do what was required to win tonight,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “Can’t come into an environment like this with a playoff-caliber team and turn the ball over like that and expect to be competitive.” Asked about his future in Pittsburgh after completing his 17th season — all of them with a record of .500 or better — Tomlin smirked and walked away. “When we got it down to seven points, I thought we were going to make a run. It comes back to the defense,” veteran defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. “There were chances. We didn’t capitalize. That was probably the biggest outlier in the game.”",

    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Library of Congress\nI have a very strong reaction to advertisements for investment products. The bedrock message of these ads is that you can’t count on anyone else to take care of you, so you’d better take steps now to ensure that you have a financially secure retirement. And the best way to do that is to purchase the annuity or whatever other product the ad is selling. The answer to financial instability down the road is capitalism.\nI see it as a stressful treadmill game the vast majority of us won’t win. If we can’t count on each other to bring about a secure retirement for everyone—through public programs like Social Security—then we’re screwed.\nI have the same strong reaction when I hear about the soaring\ncost of long-term care. This subject is of particular interest to me because I’m a daily consumer of that care. I use a power wheelchair to get around all day, every day. Every morning and night, someone comes to my home to assist me with all of the daily tasks I can’t do for myself.\nI’ve hired several people to help me. I call them my pit crew, and they are paid an hourly wage. I could never afford to pay them on my own, but that’s OK, because a\nstate program largely funded by Medicaid pays their wages.\nI’d bet that all of us, or at least someone we love, will eventually need some form of assistance with navigating our homes and communities for a prolonged or indefinite period of time. But when we think about how we would pay for that help, it feels hopelessly daunting. So we shrug and move on and hope it never happens to us.\nIf it feels dismaying, that’s because it is, particularly when viewed through the lens of capitalism. It’s laughable to believe that many of us could even think about saving enough to cover the cost of long-term care. We feel abandoned because that’s the position capitalism puts us in. The glorious free market can’t figure out a way to address this need that doesn’t exploit the hell out of those who receive and provide long-term care.\nThe answer is socialism and creativity.\nWhen I say socialism, I mean making an unwavering societal commitment to the ideals of fairness. In this case, the ideal is that everyone in need of home and community assistance must get it swiftly and at no cost. They must be able to hire anyone they want to help them, including family members. And those providing the assistance must be paid a living wage and receive benefits.\nWhen I say creativity, I mean making an unwavering societal commitment to turning that ideal into a reality, by any means necessary.\nIn other words, no one who needs this kind of assistance should ever be made to feel like a burden. Because, too often, that’s the way it is now.\nIf you need assistance, like I do, and you can’t turn to the public, then you turn to your family. But it’s impossible not to feel like you’re imposing on them and holding them back. Family members likely feel obliged to help you for free. And because they are helping you for free, you feel as if you have little control over your life. You feel as if you have to accept whatever help they provide because you have no choice. Who else would do it for free?\nPaying my workers a decent wage makes a big difference. First of all, their labor is worth something. It’s important. And it’s worth a lot more than they’re currently paid.\nAlso, paying them means there’s something in it for both of us. I need their help and they need an income. We both have negotiating leverage. If they don’t do a good job or they want to move on, I’ll look for someone else.\nRelying on family for help assumes that a person has a family that’s willing and able to help in the first place. I come from a loving and supportive family, but they’re all dead. Even if they weren’t, they’d be too old to help me much in this regard.\nIt’s laughable to believe that many of us could even think about saving enough to cover the cost of long-term care. We feel abandoned because that’s the position capitalism puts us in.\nIf you don’t have a family that’s willing and able to help you for free, capitalism offers the dreadful alternative of banishment to nursing homes, which often are highly profitable private businesses. The more they can lower their expenses, the larger their potential profits. That’s why they\npay their workers so poorly and feed their residents a lot of Creamette.\nThe costs of even entering a nursing home add insult to injury. According to the insurance company\nGenworth, the national median monthly cost in 2021 for a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $7,908. People have to figure out how to pay for that. A family might have to liquidate financial assets to pay for the nursing home until they are impoverished deeply enough to qualify for public programs like Medicaid.\nNo wonder family members feel obliged to care for their loved ones for free, for hours on end. They see themselves as the only thing standing in the way of their loved one having no option but to surrender to a miserable existence in a nursing home.\nWatching family members struggle so much physically, emotionally, and financially magnifies the guilty feelings the person receiving assistance experiences. It makes them feel like even more of a burden.\nI get the help I need because my state, Illinois, has a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver. This means that Illinois has received permission from the federal government to spend Medicaid funds in a manner that enables disabled people like me to hire folks to assist us at home.\nAccording to Medicaid’s website, HCBS waivers are designed to “meet the needs of people who prefer to get long-term care services and support in their home or community, rather than in an institutional setting.”\nAnd\naccording to AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), 77 percent of adults fifty and older prefer to “age in place.” I’m amazed that number is so low. I thought it would be at least 99.9999999999 percent. Why would anyone prefer to move into a stinkin’ nursing home?\nAnyway,\nMedicaid’s website also notes that in 2009, nearly one million people were receiving services under HCBS waivers, and there are currently 257 active waiver programs operating in nearly every state and in the District of Columbia.\nThe broad concept behind waivers is a good one to build upon, but some details make them very flawed. Thus, a whole lot of disabled people who need and desire HCBS assistance still can’t get it.\nFor instance, Medicaid says that HCBS waiver programs must “demonstrate that providing waiver services won’t cost more than providing these services in an institution.” Imposing this requirement on states that want to implement HCBS programs implies that it’s OK to incarcerate disabled people in nursing homes if it costs the government less money. That’s wrong. This should be a matter of rights, not of fiscal considerations.\nNursing homes and other institutions don’t have to live up to the same standard. They can receive Medicaid money to help cover the cost of serving their disabled residents, whether it’s cheaper or not.\nAnd the idea of waivers is itself flawed. States have to get permission from the feds to deviate from the norm if they want to use Medicaid funds to pay for HCBS. HCBS should be the rule, and institutionalization the exception. The system is currently rigged.\nLawmakers have\nintroduced federal legislation to address this problem, called the HCBS Access Act. The main change it would make is to require states to fund HCBS programs for Medicaid-eligible residents who prefer them, rather than having to apply for waivers.\nIn a brief summary of the bill, its sponsor, Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania,\nwrote that if disabled people and older adults “want to remain in their homes with help of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), they are often put on a waiting list and can wait years or even decades for services and supports. Medicaid policy has always paid for nursing homes and other institutional care . . . but will not pay for home and community-based services unless a waiver has been granted. This bill would put both options on equal footing and give families an equal choice.”\nIf passed, the bill would help a lot. But it would still leave people behind, because it would continue to tie HCBS eligibility to Medicaid eligibility. That means disabled people and their families may still have to impoverish themselves to be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid before they can qualify for publicly funded care assistance.\nWe still have a lot of work to do to live up to the ideal that everyone in need of home and community assistance must be able to get it—swiftly and for free.",
