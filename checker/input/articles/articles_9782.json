    "text": "Previsioni meteo, molti giorni di maltempo (foto Ansa)\nRoma, 3 gennaio 2025 – Il nuovo anno porta con sé una ventata di freddo gelido sull’Italia: le correnti nord atlantiche con piogge e perturbazioni sono già in transito sul Paese. A parlarne è Antonio Sanò , fondatore del sito ilMeteo.it , che specifica che la prima perturbazione dell’anno è partita dalla Romagna ed è diretta verso il Sud.\nCosa succederà nelle prossime ore I primi ‘obiettivi colpiti’ di questo fronte, collegato ad una vasta area di bassa pressione polare centrata sul Mar Baltico, sono la Romagna, le Marche, la Toscana e il Lazio , che stanno già subendo precipitazioni. 3BMeteo specifica che accumuli pluviometrici di oltre 20mm sono attesi sull'Appennino pistoiese. Il maltempo si sposterà quindi verso le restanti regioni del Centro e tra Campania e Basilicata . In serata sarà la volta di Puglia e Alta Calabria . Bassa Calabria e Sicilia resteranno le ultime roccaforti del bel tempo. In Sardegna il tempo sarà variabile , con qualche rovescio sul versante occidentale.\nNeanche il vento darà scampo: le piogge saranno accompagnate da un rinforzo di Libeccio su buona parte del Centro-Sud. La Liguria sarà colpita da raffiche di Tramontana fino a 60-70 km/h . Nella sera la situazione di maltempo rientrerà con la rotazione dei venti da Maestrale: situazione diversa al Sud , che sarà interessato da rovesci sparsi con un generale peggioramento delle condizioni meteorologiche.\nDove è prevista la neve 3BMeteo fa sapere che la notte tra ieri e oggi ha generato qualche nevicata sulle Alpi , specie sui settori di confine, “con accumuli fino a 30cm su quelli franco-svizzeri, anche se al primo mattino le condizioni sono già in miglioramento”.\nSi imbiancheranno gli Appennini : la neve è prevista a quote medie, fino ai 900-1100 metri stando alle previsioni de IlMeteo.it; una vera e propria boccata d’aria per gli impianti sciistici della dorsale. Neve anche sulla Valle d’Aosta e sui rilievi alpini di confine.\nCosa aspettarsi nel weekend Con l’arrivo del weekend potremo salutare la prima perturbazione del 2025: per sabato è generalmente previsto il sole , ad eccezione di qualche nube in val Padana e alla sera. Ma la parentesi di bel tempo durerà poco : la seconda perturbazione dell’anno si avvicinerà, pronta ad entrare in modo più esteso da domenica sera.\nLa giornata di domenica sarà all’insegna di un tempo prettamente nuvoloso al Nord e sulla Toscana , con qualche piovasco tra Liguria e Versilia . Nel corso della giornata la Pianura Padana potrebbe essere interessata da pioviggine, specie sul settore occidentale. Per il resto del Paese previste ancora ampie schiarite , con tempo discreto e prevalentemente soleggiato al Centro-Sud.\nIl ciclone della Befana Ma è alla sera che inizierà a colpire il ‘Ciclone della Befana’: sebbene interesserà principalmente la zona compresa tra Londra e Parigi – come uragano di categoria 1 – gli effetti si sentiranno chiaramente anche in Italia. Vento e piogge saranno notevolmente rinforzati . Sono attese correnti tese di Scirocco soprattutto sui nostri mari e lungo le coste tirreniche. Ci saranno inoltre precipitazioni al Nord con neve sulle Alpi oltre i 1.000 metri (qualche fiocco a bassa quota sul Piemonte meridionale) e piogge sparse sulle regioni centrali tirreniche.\nLa mappa di 3BMeteo\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",

    "title": "Sam Altman’s Eye-Scanning Orb Has a New Look—and Will Come Right to Your Door | WIRED",
    "text": "Last year, a foundation called Tools for Humanity went on tour to [show off its eye-scanning Orb.](https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-worldcoin-tools-for-humanity/) The metallic globe—an actual, physical orb—was one part of a process where citizens would someday use their biometric information to verify their humanity. The project, called Worldcoin, might have been written off as another techno-utopian project bound to fail had it not had one name attached to it: Sam Altman, the cofounder and CEO of [OpenAI](https://www.wired.com/tag/openai), one of the most dramatic tech companies of the modern era. An inkling of Worldcoin began in 2019 when Altman began exploring identity verification that could be used in universal basic income schemes. He teamed up with technologist Alex Blania to turn the idea into a reality. In a world of rapidly advancing AI, they theorized, it would be important for a human to prove they were not a bot. The answer they came up with relied on individuals using iris-scanning tech to generate private tokens that would verify their identities around the world. Worldcoin, then, is the ultimate attempt at tech solutionism: A human-grade AI world that Altman is building might also be technologically regulated by a tool that Altman has his hands in. Today, in an airy space in San Francisco’s Mission District, Altman and Blania presented their latest vision for Worldcoin, now rebranded to the World Network, or World for short. The event included keynote presentations, new hardware, promises of expanded services, and hands-on (eyes-on?) time with the new product, like an Apple event if the Apple designers had just returned from an ayahuasca retreat. (The Wi-Fi password for the event: IntelligenceAge.) A spokesperson for Tools for Humanity said all event attendees can have their iris scanned today, and 500 attendees will receive a new Orb when it ships in 2025. “We need more orbs, lots more orbs, probably on the order of a thousand more orbs than we have today,” Tools for Humanity chief device officer Rich Heley said during the keynote. This Orb has a new, pearly look. It’s running on Nvidia’s Jetson chipset and, according to Tools for Humanity, “provides nearly 5X the AI performance” for faster identity verification. None of this makes it less bizarre. In Latin America, starting next year, the Orb will be ordered on-demand like a pizza: Through a partnership with the app Rappi, citizens can have an Orb show up at their door to scan their irises and sign up for the World Network. The Orb then goes on its merry way. (Tools for Humanity designer Thomas Meyerhoffer said that the SD card that arrives at someone’s door has no prior data.) World says it’s opening two Orb-scanning spaces, in Buenos Aires and Mexico City. The Orb might also show up in your neighborhood corner store or coffee shop, where you’ll be able to order an iris scan with your latte. There are currently four locations in the US where you can “find your nearest Orb,” and 333 Orb sites globally. This Orb hardware is really just a vessel of sensors and semiconductors required to capture your eyeballs. Once that biometric data is captured, it goes into an app. This, very obviously, raises questions about data privacy and storage. Blania insists that when a user creates a World ID and has their iris scanned and stored in the World app, it’s encrypted and stored only on local devices. It’s this World app and World network that will power Altman and Blania’s vision for the identity verification future, and these software services got an upgrade today, too. Several of them. First, Altman and Blania say they have expanded the capabilities of the World ID service to support several hundred million credentials, a bump up from the approximately 7 million World ID holders who are already “Orb-verified,” a perhaps unsettling neologism. The company is launching a new feature called Deep Face (a play on “deepfake”) that it says will provide a new way to combat fraud. It will be compatible with virtual communication apps like FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Zoom. If someone shows up on a video call purporting to be you, and you’ve been identity-verified through World, the idea is that the app would flag that it’s not the real you. WIRED asked Blania how the company plans to provide its Deep Face service, which would require some type of facial recognition, while also adhering to its new data privacy principles. He described a scenario in which a person’s World ID is stored and running locally on their Mac computer, and that it’s used as a kind of app layer to run over a video chat when that person logs on and is using the device’s camera. But World still doesn’t have any official partnerships with Apple, Meta, or Zoom for this solution; it just said the World app will “support” these processes. During the event today, World also said its blockchain network—“the world’s first blockchain designed for humans”—is now live, which means the several million holders of World ID and World App users will be migrated to this new, underlying blockchain network. While the biometric-scanning Orb and the World network have their roots in crypto tokens, “crypto” wasn’t an oft-mentioned word during the event. Instead, Altman and Blania emphasized World’s blockchain service, digital asset management, and virtual communication tools. Blania claimed during the press briefing that, in the future, World hopes to build the “largest finance network” on the planet. In a separate interview with WIRED, Blania said that during regular Sunday meetings at Atlman’s house, the pair were inspired by the rise of PayPal. Similar to the way that Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and others once pioneered digital payments and fundamentally changed online commerce—becoming billionaires themselves in the process—the World team saw themselves building out a similar network for tokens on a distributed network. The World app, for now, is free for everyone to use. It’s free to scan your eyeballs, too. Tools for Humanity itself is venture-backed, and the foundation, in its land grab for the modern identity verification market and your personal biometric data, is focused on scale, scale, scale. Eventually, it may make money through processing fees, Blania said. Most of Tools for Humanity’s expansion plans for now are in locations outside of the US, due to murky regulations around crypto stateside, the organization’s spokesperson told me. If you use the Orb and compatible app in the US, it will scan and store your iris but won’t generate a crypto token for you. Two and a half years ago, the Worldcoin project [came under scrutiny for allegedly deceptive and exploitative practices](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/) in recruiting individuals to scan their irises. At the time, Blania attributed this haphazard behavior to the organization still being in its “startup” phase. In an interview with WIRED, Blania said the company is doing “like, a thousand things” to ensure a more rigorous consent process. This includes staffing an “operational team” in every market where World will be. He said there will be “explanations” in the World app for how the product works. “And again, there is no data stored in any central place or anything,” Blania said. In 2023, the service was also being investigated by governments in Germany, Brazil, India, South Korea, and Kenya over concerns about how it was storing and using biometric data. Kenya suspended Worldcoin enrollment entirely. South Korea fined the company. Worldcoin suspended its own service in India, Brazil, and France. Blania said he believes World will relaunch in Kenya “sometime soon.” When asked in the press briefing about the emphasis on Latin America as a market for expansion, such as through the partnership with Rappi for orbs-on-delivery, Blania disputed the idea that World was prioritizing Latin America over other locations. “It’s just that we have limited resources, and there’s a natural sequencing happening,” Blania said. “We are similarly focused on Asia and other places. Argentina has been a fast-growing market for us, for example, and we’re excited about that.” “But the project is literally called World,” he added. After the keynote, Altman ran into the press room to wave and apologize for not being able to stay, then slipped away like a head of state.",

    "text": "Les prévisions concernant le cyclone Chido s'affinent d'heure en heure. Le phénomène se trouve actuellement à 120 kilomètres de Mayotte et se déplace dans sa direction à une vitesse de 20 km/h. Il devrait être au plus proche d'ici 7h30 ce samedi 14 décembre, soit un peu plus tôt que prévu. Chido devait initialement atteindre l'île vers 9h. Les rafales de vent, les précipitations et la houle commenceront à se manifester dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, à mesure que le cyclone approche des côtes mahoraises.\n\" Il est en train d'augmenter en intensité \", précise le géographe Said Said Hachim sur le plateau de Mayotte la 1ère. \"On voyait l'œil qui se rapetissait, comme s'il allait se scinder en deux, mais c'était juste le mur qui changeait.\" Un espoir vite douché, le cyclone poursuit donc la trajectoire prévue. Météo France a déjà annoncé des rafales de vent entre 130 et 180 km/h, voir 200km/h dans la partie nord de Mayotte, qui sera la plus touchée.\nIdem pour les précipitations : elles oscilleront entre 100 à 150 mm de pluies au sud, à 200 mm au nord. Les vagues devraient atteindre 3 à 5 mètres ce samedi matin dans le lagon et 6 à 9 mètres en dehors du lagon. L'alerte rouge est toujours de vigueur. Les Mahorais ont l'interdiction formelle de sortir dehors jusqu'à la fin de l'alerte, ils sont invités à se tenir informé et à suivre les consignes transmises par les autorités.",

भगवान सूर्य की तस्वीर स्थापित कर रहे हैं तो आपको वास्तु के अनुसार सही दिशा का ध्यान रखना चाहिए। घर में भगवान सूर्य की मूर्ति लगाने के लिए आदर्श दिशा पूर्व को माना जाता है। ऐसी मान्यता है कि यह दिशा उगते हुए सूर्य का प्रतीक होती है और यदि आप इसी दिशा में सूर्य देव की प्रतिमा या तस्वीर लगाती हैं तो आपके लिए शुभ संकेत माने जाते हैं। यह दिशा उगते सूरज से जुड़ी है, जो नई शुरुआत, जीवन शक्ति और

रही हैं तो वह स्थान स्वच्छ और अच्छी रोशनी वाला होना चाहिए। हमेशा सुनिश्चित करें कि वह क्षेत्र जहां भगवान सूर्य की मूर्ति रखी गई है वह साफ-सुथरा, अव्यवस्था मुक्त और अच्छी रोशनी वाला होना चाहिए। सूर्य की पर्याप्त रोशनी प्रतिमा की आभा और चमक को बढ़ा सकती है, जिससे पूरे स्थान में सकारात्मक कंपन बढ़ जाता है। - भगवान सूर्य की प्रतिमा को हमेशा एक स्थिर और ऊंचे मंच या वेदी पर ही रखने की सलाह दी जाती है। सुनिश्चित करें कि सूर्य देव की पूजा करते समय उनका स्थान आंखों के स्तर पर या थोड़ा ऊपर स्थित होना चाहिए, जिससे उनके प्रति सम्मान प्रदर्शित होता है। इसे कभी भी सीधे जमीन या अंधेरे वाले स्थान पर नहीं रखना चाहिए। - भगवान सूर्य की प्रतिमा को नकारात्मक ऊर्जा वाले क्षेत्रों, जैसे बाथरूम, स्टोररूम या अव्यवस्थित स्थानों जहां कूड़ा-कचरा इकठ्ठा हो, वहां रखने से बचना चाहिए। मान्यता है कि नकारात्मक कंपन सकारात्मक ऊर्जा के प्रवाह में बाधा डाल सकते हैं और मूर्ति की प्रभावशीलता को कम कर सकते हैं। यदि आप अपने घर में सूर्य देव की तस्वीर या मूर्ति स्थापित करती हैं तो ये वास्तु के अनुसार बहुत शुभ मानी जाती है और आपके घर में सकारात्मक ऊर्जा का संचार करती है। आपकी राय हमारे लिए महत्वपूर्ण है! हमारे इस रीडर सर्वे को भरने के लिए थोड़ा समय जरूर निकालें। इससे हमें आपकी प्राथमिकताओं को बेहतर ढंग से समझने में

    "title": "UFL Transforms Customer Service with Salesforce's Agentforce Platform",
    "text": "Small business owners looking to enhance customer engagement and streamline operations can take a page from the United Football League’s (UFL) latest partnership with Salesforce. The league has adopted Salesforce’s innovative Agentforce technology, positioning itself to optimize fan experiences while driving growth through revolutionary ticket sales and customer support strategies.\nJosh Cella, UFL Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, articulated the vision behind this collaboration: “The UFL is thrilled to partner with Salesforce, a true technology leader in AI offerings. As a league heading into its second season, the UFL embraces new technologies that will help us to reach new heights. Our fans are at the core of everything we do and we believe Salesforce’s Agentforce will enable us to better cater to their needs.”\nAt its core, Salesforce’s Agentforce is designed to serve as a digital workforce, allowing organizations like the UFL to manage customer inquiries effectively while significantly reducing the burden on sales teams. For small business owners, implementing similar technology can yield several key benefits, especially in industries where customer interaction is critical.\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the UFL and Salesforce partnership is the use of AI agents to address common customer queries. These AI tools can handle frequent topics such as ticket bookings, product inquiries, and stadium policies, providing immediate, 24/7 support. As a result, employees can redirect their focus to more complex issues requiring human intervention, ultimately enhancing efficiency and satisfaction.\nMoreover, the initiative promises to improve game-day interactions for fans by managing inquiries related to ticketing, stadium logistics, and other event details. This shift not only supports customer service teams but also enriches the overall fan experience, a lesson that small business owners can adopt to create more engaging customer interactions.\nFor instance, small retailers could utilize similar AI-driven platforms to manage online customer inquiries, helping to direct customer service agents toward high-value interactions and customized service experiences. By leveraging technology to automate routine tasks, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction while optimizing their resource allocation.\nAdditionally, the collaboration extends beyond traditional customer service aspects. Salesforce will also assist the UFL in developing an easy-to-navigate website that integrates a virtual assistant, \"Dash.\" This feature enables fans to find answers to game-related questions quickly. Small business retailers could consider implementing user-friendly online interfaces paired with chatbots to facilitate effortless customer engagement.\nAlthough the partnership demonstrates considerable benefits, small business owners should remain cognizant of potential challenges. Implementing AI technology comes with its learning curves, not only for the software but also for the personnel who will be managing and maintaining these systems. Sufficient training for existing staff to understand and harness the AI tools effectively is crucial, as their integration should be seamless rather than disruptive.\nMoreover, while AI advancements present increased efficiency, they could also inadvertently lead to a less personalized approach to customer interactions if not balanced correctly. Small businesses must be careful to maintain a human touch in customer service, ensuring that AI enhancements add to rather than detract from genuine client connections.\nAs the UFL embarks on this new chapter, starting with the kickoff of their 2025 season on March 28, the collaboration with Salesforce signifies a strategy deeply rooted in fan engagement and operational excellence. With FOX broadcasting and incorporating player performance analytics into their games—a feature made possible through this partnership—UFL is poised to amplify viewer experience both in the stadium and at home.\nIn essence, for small business owners, the UFL’s partnership with Salesforce serves as a beneficial case study on customer engagement and operational efficiency. By adopting elements of this strategy, businesses can better connect with their customers, respond to inquiries more rapidly, and allocate their resources more wisely—a trifecta that could lead to elevating their brand and boosting their bottom line.\nTo learn more about this initiative, you can visit the original press release here.\nImage Via Salesforce",
