José Mourinho treinou o Manchester United de 2016 a 2019 e esta quinta-feira teve a oportunidade de reencontrar algumas caras conhecidas, mas o abraço mais caloroso foi com Casemiro, jogador que trabalhou com Mourinho ainda no Real Madrid. Já com a bola a rolar, entrou melhor a equipa de Old Trafford com Diogo Dalot a titular, mas sem Bruno Fernandes, a cumprir o castigo ditado pela expulsão no Dragão. A equipa de Erik ten Hag acabou por chegar à vantagem aos 15 minutos, numa transição rápida conduzida por Zirkezee e finalizada com uma bomba de Eriksen à entrada da área.

No entanto, não foi preciso esperar muitos minutos para a equipa turca chegar ao empate, logo a abrir a segunda parte, com Saint-Maximin a cruzar a bola da esquerda para En-Nesyri marcar de cabeça na área.

    "text": "Skip To... [The Bold and the Beautiful](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/the-bold-and-the-beautiful) heroine Hope Logan is a legacy character. As the daughter of the iconic vixen Brooke Logan, she’s the opposite of her mother. The young fashionista is the show’s good girl, who serves to be a role model for others. Although the character has her loyal fans, she’s drawn mixed reactions from [soap opera](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/soap-opera/) viewers. This past year, she’s undergone a huge personality transformation. When Hope began dating Thomas Forrester, it was a new beginning for her. She was no long the meek girl who let everyone control her life. She became more independent and stood up for herself, which viewers loved. However, her behavior following her breakup with Thomas doesn’t do the character any favors. Hope Logan is Pursuing a Married Man on The Bold and the Beautiful After Hope rejected another of Thomas’ marriage proposals, he decided to leave town. She was devastated for about five minutes before she [set her sights on another man](https://thenerdstash.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-creates-drama-with-finn-and-hope-romance/). She and John “Finn” Finnegan have become close as she sought his help with her migraines. Finn’s magic fingers have awoken feelings in Hope because she’s got a crush on the handsome doctor. However, there’s a problem. Finn is married to Hope’s longtime nemesis Steffy Forrester. Miss Logan and Miss Forrester have been [embroiled in a feud](https://thenerdstash.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-teases-twist-in-steffy-and-hope-feud/) for over a decade. The source of their rivalry consisted of fighting over Liam Spencer. But now the two women will be fighting again with Hope pursuing Steffy’s husband. This week Hope finally makes her move during a party at the Forrester mansion. A tipsy Hope gets Finn alone and kisses him, much to his shock. The Writing For the Character Doesn’t Make Sense The kiss not only horrified Finn, who put Hope on blast, but also fans. On a That scene with Finn is making Hope’s character going low into the dumpster. Another viewer wrote: I’ve never been a fan of Hope but they are ruining her and if I was one of her fans I’d be furious at what they’re doing to her. The storyline of her chasing after Finn is ridiculous and makes her character look awful. Finn hasn’t shown any romantic interest in her. The only thing he’s done is defend and praise her to Steffy, which increases Miss Logan’s infatuation. Although she told Brooke she wasn’t a homewrecker, her kissing Finn says otherwise. It seems evident she wants to break up Steffy and Finn’s marriage, but the question is why. Related: [The Young and the Restless & The Bold and the Beautiful Crossover Romances That Should Happen](https://thenerdstash.com/4-the-young-and-the-restless-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-crossover-romances-that-should-happen/) She and Steffy have been clashing at work because of the Hope for the Future line. With the clothing brand losing money, Steffy wants to cut it, but Hope and Brooke won’t allow it. Perhaps stealing Finn is her way of getting back at Steffy for taking everything away from her. Another possibility is that Hope has a diagnosed medical condition. Her constant headaches seemed to foreshadow health issues, but the writers have pursued that angle. She could have a brain tumor or a mental disorder, which Finn or Taylor Hayes can help her with. First, there’s the question of if she loves Finn. When [Thomas returned briefly](https://thenerdstash.com/is-matthew-atkinson-leaving-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-again-after-just-returning-from-break/) to Los Angeles, she was ecstatic to see him and tried to reconcile. But when rejected, she turned her attention back to Finn. It’s obvious that Hope doesn’t know what she wants, and the writers don’t know what to do with her. The storyline with Finn is a bomb, making the character look unstable and creepy. Unless something drastic changes, it appears things are going to worsen for Hope.",

FILE PHOTO/Agence France-Presse\nVATICAN CITY, Holy See — Pope Francis, who was admitted to hospital last week, has developed pneumonia in both of his lungs, the Vatican said Tuesday, adding that the 88-year-old was in “good spirits”.\n“The laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father’s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture”, the Vatican said in a statement.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital last Friday for bronchitis, but the Vatican on Monday said it was changing his treatment following tests.\nREAD: Pope has polymicrobial respiratory tract infection. What is that?\nArticle continues after this advertisement It said Tuesday that a “polymicrobial infection” which has come on top of “bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex”.\nArticle continues after this advertisement “The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon… demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,” it said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.\nREAD: Pope’s condition ‘complex’, hospital stay extended: Vatican\nArticle continues after this advertisement The Vatican had already cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said he would not attend a mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, held on Sunday.\n“Nevertheless, Pope Francis is in good spirits,” it added.\nThe pope spent his fifth day in hospital alternating rest with prayer and reading texts, the Vatican said.\nPilgrims pray Francis, the head of the Catholic Church since 2013, was admitted to hospital after struggling for several days to read his texts in public.\nIt is the latest of a series of health issues for the Jesuit, who has undergone hernia and colon surgery since 2021 and uses a wheelchair due to pain in his knee.\nAmong the pilgrims and tourists gathered in Saint Peter’s Square on Tuesday, many said they were praying for the pope’s recovery.\n“I hope that he’s getting better soon,” Birgit Jungreuthmayer, a 48-year-old Austrian tourist, told AFP.\nOthers gathered outside the Gemelli hospital, holding candles or saying prayers.\n“I came to say a prayer for the pope so that he may recover soon. I send him my best wishes”, said Jacqueline Troncoso, a Bolivian resident in Rome.\nThe Vatican published drawings done by children in the hospital for Francis, as well as letters from parents asking him to pray for their sick offspring.\nFrancis “gives thanks for the closeness he feels at this time and asks, with a grateful heart, that we continue to pray for him”, it said.\nActive schedule Despite his health troubles, Francis remains a very active pontiff, with a busy weekly schedule and regular overseas trips.\nIn September 2024, he completed a four-nation Asia-Pacific tour, the longest of his papacy by duration and distance.\nA source within the pope’s entourage had told AFP Monday that Francis was admitted after a “very busy” two weeks, during which “he was weakened” — but insisted there was no alarm.\nFrancis followed last Sunday’s mass on television from hospital and sent a written address for the Angelus.\n“I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis,” Francis wrote.\nThe Jesuit has left open the option of resigning if he became unable to carry out his duties.\nHis predecessor, Benedict XVI, stunned the world in 2013 by becoming the first pope since the Middle Ages to step down, citing his ailing health.\nBut in a memoir published last year, Francis wrote that he did “not have any cause serious enough to make me think of resigning”.\nStepping down is a “distant possibility” that would be justified only in the event of “a serious physical impediment”, he wrote.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "--All CIT patients maintained platelet counts >75 x 109/L at 1-week following chemotherapy plus a single dose of SCB-219M, with durable responses through at least 3-weeks-- --Durable efficacy and PK profile expected to support convenient dosing interval of â¥2-weeks, compared to daily or weekly dosing for current treatment options in China[1] and globally[2]-- --Phase â b trial in CIT and CTIT (cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia) patients evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M is planned to initiate in 2024-- CHENGDU, China, Dec. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Clover; HKEX: 02197), a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, today announced positive preliminary safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics data in a Phase â clinical trial evaluating SCB-219M, an innovative thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) mimetic bispecific Fc-fusion protein produced from CHO cells, for the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). All cancer patients enrolled to-date (n=9) receiving chemotherapy plus a single subcutaneous dose of SCB-219M observed platelet counts maintained or recovered at >75 x 109/L (threshold level for CIT) after one week, with responses durable through at least three weeks (i.e. through the chemotherapy cycle). In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to <75 x 109/L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals â¥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified. Dr. Yongsheng Wang, Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase â Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase â results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\" \"We are pleased to announce positive Phase â results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang, Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections[1] and globally requiring weekly injections[2], the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\" The Phase â trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase â b trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024. CIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50%[3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.",

Ambani however, did not give a timeline for the same. “We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,” Ambani said while addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.“As India races ahead to become the world’s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can …. and Reliance will … grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,” he said.RIL is building giga-scale factories for its new energy businesses. In 2023 the company also forayed into financial services.“We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani said.Reliance is India’s largest corporation by market capitalization.Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.\\\"In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.RIL's scrip ended at Rs 2605.80, up 0.75% on the BSE, Thursday. Benchmark Sensex ended 0.52% higher.",

    "text": "The chairman of the body in charge of decommissioning as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process considered standing down from the role in June 2001 after months of slow progress. Documents released from Ireland’s state files this year show a “downbeat” view of the pace of attempts to ensure the IRA and other paramilitary groups disabled their arms after the Good Friday Agreement. Officials from Ireland’s Department of Justice and from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) met the three commissioners of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) on June 27. Despite six meetings with the IRA representative since March, IICD chairman John de Chastelain said that “we are no nearer actually decommissioning”. William Fittall of the NIO noted that, “more provocatively”, the three commissioners were proposing to be released from their roles by September 24, on its fourth anniversary. “John de Chastelain stressed that he and his colleagues did not want to be irresponsible or walk away from their commitments. But they had personal lives they needed to get on with.” He also expressed concern about the commission’s credibility given “the impasse and growing unionist scepticism”. “They thought that putting the date in the public domain might produce a helpful jolt to the system. “Nevertheless, they were open to discussion on this. They understood that the governments might want the commission still to exist with a staff member there to answer the phones. “But the present three commissioners did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September.” Mr Fittall noted that “their restlessness is something which we can exploit privately with Sinn Fein”. A week prior, Irish diplomat Niall Holohan recounted a meeting he had in Belfast with Clifford Garrard, who was Mr de Chastelain’s deputy. Mr Garrard told Mr Holohan that the “waiting game” had been “an exasperating experience” for the commission. “Garrard was of the view furthermore that nothing less than an act of putting arms completely and verifiably beyond use would be enough to save David Trimble’s scalp on July 1,” the note said. It added: “If David Trimble proceeds with his threat to resign on July 1 and the Good Friday institutions were to collapse as a result, it might prove difficult for de Chastelain to justify his continued presence in Belfast.” The commission remained in place for four more years until it was verified that all IRA materiel was decommissioned.

Es que apenas suma cinco encuentros con la camiseta de [Independiente](https://redgol.cl/tema/independiente) y no para de recibir buenas críticas de los hinchas y la prensa. En los últimos días hemos sido testigos de cómo [los fanáticos del Rojo de Avellaneda le regalaron una fuerte ovación](https://redgol.cl/internacional/felipe-loyola-independiente-hinchas-admiracion) al ex [Huachipato](https://redgol.cl/tema/huachipato) luego de la [igualdad sin goles ante River Plate](https://redgol.cl/internacional/independiente-de-felipe-loyola-vs-river-plate-de-paulo-diaz-por-fecha-13-de-futbol-argentino), donde pasó de jugar en el mediocampo a su puesto natural de lateral derecho. Y como sucede cada vez que un futbolista chileno tiene un buen desempeño al otro lado de la Cordillera, la prensa se encarga de ensalzarlo. Así ocurre, por ejemplo, en la cadena ESPN, donde uno de sus periodistas, Leandro Alves, cumplió con esa prerrogativa. Durante su presencia en el programa F90 para la señal chilena, se le consultó al comunicador por el buen presente de Loyola, y si bien se excusó en que no sigue la actualidad de Independiente, pues cubre habitualmente a [San Lorenzo](https://redgol.cl/tema/san-lorenzo), se encargó de hacerle un queque al nacional. Periodista argentino llena de flores a Felipe Loyola “Yo no sigo a Independiente, pero uno ve los partidos y realmente ha sorprendido. Y lo que más se destaca es a su entrenador Julio Vaccari por mirarlo y traerlo al fútbol argentino“, asegura el popularmente conocido Gurí sobre el chileno, para luego tirarle la pérgola completa. “Uno ve a los periodistas que siguen al club y me dicen que los hinchas de Independiente están enamorados de Loyola. En cuatro partidos se metió al hincha de Independiente en el bolsillo, y eso que es de las hinchadas más exigentes de Argentina”. Los números del chileno en Independiente este 2024 El surgido en la cantera de [Colo Colo](https://redgol.cl/colocolo) es un recién llegado al fútbol argentino, y se ganó la buena crítica en base a su polifuncionalidad dentro de la cancha. Actualmente suma cinco encuentros como titular, en liga y copa, en todos jugó los 90 minutos y ya cuenta con una asistencia.
