    "text": "Payscale Inc.’s 2025 Gender Pay Gap Report (GPGR) reveals that narrowing the gender pay gap has stalled in the U.S., with systemic barriers still limiting women’s earning potential.\nThe “uncontrolled gender pay gap” measuring the median salary for men and women in the workforce without accounting for type of job they have finds that women earn 17% less than men, or 83 cents for every $1 earned by men. Also called the “opportunity gap,” this percentage is unchanged from 2024.\nThe “controlled gender pay gap,” which measures how women are paid compared to men in the same jobs or similar jobs requiring similar education and qualifications, was also unchanged in 2025. When data is controlled for job title and other compensable factors, the gender pay gap narrows to women earning 99 cents for every $1 earned by a man.\nThe uncontrolled gender pay gap reveals the overall economic power disparity between men and women in society and is not less meaningful than the controlled gender pay gap, Payscale emphasized. Even if the controlled gender pay gap disappears — meaning women and men with the same job title and qualifications are paid equally — an uncontrolled gap would still demonstrate that women are valued less by society for their work, Payscale said.\nNotably, even when men and women have similar qualifications and education, some professions have a much wider pay disparity than the median controlled pay gap of 99 cents earned by women for every $1 earned by men. The GPGR identified 20 occupations where the controlled pay gap ranges from 87 cents to 93 cents for women for every $1 earned by men.\nThese jobs include clergy (87 cents), insurance sales agents (88 cents); first-line supervisors (89 cents); non-emergency service dispatchers (90 cents); cardiovascular technicians (91 cents); financial managers (92 cents); and pharmacy technicians (93 cents). The complete list of the 20 occupations with the widest controlled gender pay gaps can be found here .\nOther key takeaways from GPGR:\nMotherhood continues to hurt pay equity. Women with children face a significantly wider uncontrolled gender pay gap, earning just 75 cents for dollar fathers earned. Men with children earn 2% more than men without children. Women seeking new higher-paying jobs are closing the pay gap, but parenting responsibilities and workplace flexibility keep many stuck with lower wages. “In 2025, Payscale’s data do not show a significant widening of the gender pay gap; however, we also don’t see the incremental closing of the gap we are used to seeing,” the company said.",

The Friday prayers were allowed at the historic grand mosque in the Nowhatta area of the city, but Mirwaiz, who is the chief priest of Kashmir and delivers the Friday sermon at the mosque, was not allowed to move out of his residence in Nigeen, located in the outskirts of the city. Mirwaiz denounced his repeated ''house detention,'' especially on Fridays, to prevent him from delivering the Friday sermon and offering obligatory Friday prayers. In a statement, Mirwaiz said that after his release on September 22, — after four years of house detention since August 2019 — he has been allowed to go to Jamia Masjid only on three Fridays. ''Since then, every Friday, I have been put under house arrest without being provided any reason for it by the authorities. ''One doesn't know till when the ban on me continues. At their will and whim, the authorities close down or open the central Jamia Masjid to Muslims for prayers, and no one can ask why,'' he said. Congregational prayers were allowed at the Jamia Masjid on Friday last week after 10 consecutive weeks. Mirwaiz said that this ''arbitrariness, disregard'' for religious rights and sentiments of Muslims, and ''strong-arm tactics'' of the authorities, even on the basic human right to practice religion unfettered ''is a telling sign of the time and situation we are living in.'' ''It is also a mockery of the authorities' statements that 'things are great in J-K and I am a free man' who can go anywhere. ''Those in charge of decision-making should revisit this policy and think long-term in the light of historical precedents,'' Mirwaiz said.

    "text": "The shocking Chiefs player who sold more NFL gear than Travis Kelce Controversy sure pays off, seeing as Harrison Butker sold more NFL merchandise than even Travis Kelce this past spring. The [NFL Players Association’s player sales list](https://nflpa.com/partners/posts/things-to-know-about-the-season-kickoff-nflpa-top-50-player-sales-list) — which tracked sales of adult and youth game jerseys, T-shirts, hoodies, bobbleheads, pet products, and more between March 1 and May 31 — was released on Tuesday, September, 17, listing Butker, 29, as No. 11. Kelce, 34, fell just behind him, coming in at No. 12. This was the first appearance on the top 50 list for Butker, who [garnered criticism](https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-comment-harrison-butker-speech) after his May 11 commencement address at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas branded Pride Month a “deadly sin” and advised the graduating women to embrace becoming “homemakers.” He infamously told the women graduating college that they are sold “diabolical lies,” before slamming any who aimed to pursue careers. “Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world,” he said. The backlash for the speech was swift, with a Change.org petition calling for his removal from the Chiefs garnering over 260K signatures. Instead, that August the Chiefs went on to re-sign Butker with the [highest contract for a kicker](https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/news/report-harrison-butker-signing-contract-extension-with-kansas-city-chiefs-becomes-highest-paid-kicker-in-nfl) in the NFL — $26.5 million for four years. The controversy clearly also did not hurt his merchandise sales, which made him only the second placekicker in history to rank inside the top 50 on the list. Evan McPherson of the Cincinnati Bengals also made the list in 2022. His teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, ranked No. 2 on the list, just behind another quarterback, top seller C.J. Stroud of the Houston Texans. The rest of the top five included Detroit Lions stars Aidan Hutchinson — who rose 15 spots from the previous list — and Amon-Ra St. Brown — who rose a whopping 29 spots from the previous list — and Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals. —[ Enjoy free dish of rich and fabulous players with The Athlete Lifestyle on SI](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/) — Small packages…: [Livvy Dunne’s astonishing petite size next to pro volleyball player](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/news/livvy-dunne-astonishing-petite-size-next-to-pro-volleyball-player) …with power: [Livvy Dunne shows off incredibly ‘hard’ gymnastics moves](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/news/livvy-dunne-shows-off-incredibly-hard-gymnastics-moves) WAG MVP: [Rachel Bush, NFL WAG All-Star, pops out in skintight white dress](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/fashion/rachel-bush-nfl-wag-skintight-white-dress-italy) New WAG intrigue: [Who is Joe Burrow’s girlfriend Olivia Holzmacher?](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/news/who-is-joe-burrows-girlfriend-olivia-holzmacher) Ahh: [The cutest photos of ‘ultimate girl dad’ Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce’s kids](https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/relationship-feed-page/the-cutest-photos-of-ultimate-girl-dad-jason-kelce-and-kylie-kelces-kids)",

Ciencia » Salud Psicología Tecnología Mundo Israel reconoce el \"fracaso\" de matar a tres rehenes pero dice que los militares estaban \"en alerta máxima\" Agencias @DiarioSigloXXI jueves, 28 de diciembre de 2023, 21:17 h (CET) MADRID, 28 (EUROPA PRESS) Las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) han concluido la investigación del incidente de mediados de diciembre, cuando un batallón en el barrio gazatí de Shejaiya mató por error a tres de los rehenes tomados por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) durante su ofensiva del 7 de octubre, origen de la actual guerra en Oriente Próximo. Según ha relatado el jefe del Estado Mayor israelí, el teniente general Herzi Halevi, aquel episodio fue \"un evento difícil con resultados muy difíciles\". \"Las FDI fracasaron en su misión de rescatar a los rehenes en este evento\", ha manifestado el alto mando militar, según informaciones recogidas por el diario 'The Times of Israel'. \"Toda la cadena de mando se siente responsable de este difícil acontecimiento, lamenta este resultado y comparte el dolor de las familias de los tres rehenes\", ha añadido Halevi; mientras que el informe final de las FDI argumenta que los militares implicados en este suceso \"estaban en estado de alerta máxima\". De hecho, la investigación de lo ocurrido ha concluido que el batallón desplegado en la zona no tenía \"suficiente conciencia\" sobre la posibilidad de encontrarse con rehenes, por lo que la misión no se trataba de un operativo especial para liberar a secuestrados por la milicia palestina. \"Los soldados de las FDI involucrados en el incidente experimentaron situaciones de combate complejas en los días anteriores al incidente y estaban en estado de alerta máxima ante una amenaza\", reza el informe final, que señala que las tropas fueron víctimas de \"engaños\" por parte de milicianos de Hamás, que llegaron incluso a tratar de introducirlos en pozos y edificios repletos de explosivos. Así pues, el Ejército israelí ha detallado que, en el marco de \"intensos combates\" en Shejaiya, un soldado del 17º Batallón de la Brigada Bislamach abrió fuego contra tres personas que había identificado erróneamente como una amenaza. Dos de estas tres personas murieron en el acto a causa de los disparos, mientras que la tercera logró huir. Los comandantes presentes en la zona ordenaron cesar el fuego para poder identificar a esta tercera persona, que al cabo del tiempo gritó desde un edificio cercano pidiendo ayuda en hebreo. Las tropas presentes instaron a esta persona a avanzar hacia ellos, pero en ese momento otros militares que no habían escuchado la orden de alto el fuego debido al ruido producido por un tanque, dispararon fatalmente a la que sería la tercera víctima. Así las cosas, las FDI han señalado que, de acuerdo con su análisis de la situación y según imágenes aéreas obtenidas, los tres rehenes estaban sin camiseta y uno de ellos ondeaba una bandera blanca improvisada en el momento en que se acercaban las tropas israelíes. Sin embargo, el militar que abrió fuego tenía una \"visión limitada\" de la situación. Halevi ha concluido que los disparos a los rehenes \"podrían haberse evitado\" pero que \"no hubo maldad en el evento y los soldados llevaron a cabo la acción correcta según su mejor comprensión de la situación en ese momento\". Además, Halevi ha incidido en la \"suma importancia de cumplir con los procedimientos operativos\" de las FDI. El Ejército de Israel reconoció el pasado 15 de diciembre haber matado por error durante una operación en el barrio de Shejaiya, en el norte de la Franja de Gaza, a tres de los rehenes tomados por Hamás a comienzos de octubre. Las autoridades identificaron a los fallecidos como Yotam Haum, Samer Talalka y Alon Shamriz. El primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, reconoció recibir con \"profundo dolor\" la \"insoportable\" noticia y aseguro que, incluso en momentos duros como aquel, Israel aprendería las lecciones y continuaría adelante con sus esfuerzos para liberar a todos los rehenes de Hamás. La milicia palestina lanzó a comienzos de octubre un ataque contra Israel que dejó un balance de casi 1.200 muertos y 240 rehenes. Las FDI respondieron rápidamente con una cruenta contraofensiva contra las estructuras de Hamás en la Franja de Gaza y que deja ya más de 21.300 muertos y otros 55.600 heridos.

    "text": "By Atreyee sen ,\n52 minutes ago\nNetizens can't stop laughing after a video of a man evading toll on a skateboard surfaced on X. The reactions to this video are absolutely hilarious as fans are struck by a jolt of surprise, humor, and awe. The way the skater suddenly slid down into the floor and went straight to the elevator evading the toll right in front using no superpowers but a skateboard, sent everyone in laughing stitches.\nThe quirky appeal of the video is in its simplicity and unpredictability. Toll booths, mean you have to wait and follow the process duly. But this daring person skipped this tedious part of travel and chose to glide it all away in style.\nThe unexpected move gave many netizens a necessary boost of thrill and excitement. For many, the video serves as a reminder that fun can be found anywhere. It takes just a skateboard to begin.\nBeyond the laughs, the quirky video throws light on how when it comes to internet laughter, no incident is too small to go unnoticed. Moments like these bring vibrancy and a taste of change while we live an otherwise mundane and monotonous life.\nWhile netizens keep the comment section abuzz with their signature humor, memes, and jokes, we have picked the best ones for you.\nNetizens in stitches as video of man evading toll on a skateboard goes viral A humorous comment ensued, (Via @SupahAndre/X)\nNow that’s how you get around indoors A netizen humorously chimed in, (Via @MT_Simmons/X)\nSorry, that shouldn't even be illegal. The metro should just update their policies Either pay for your pass OR jump it in STYLE both are accepted as payment Someone else humorously pointed out, (Via @LeftistLunatics/X)\nHumans are amazing but especially when avoiding toll booths Another user humorously remarked, (Via @Headlines_Fix/X)\nI despise fair jumping, but this guy earned his free ride Another social media user joked,\nEveryone around him is acting like that’s normal. You’re watching an elite performance To top things off, here are a few funny gifs for you!\nSomeone playfully joked, (Via @HumansNoContext/X)\nAs the clip continues to gain more attention, it has taken a life on its own. In no time, moments like these get cemented in pop cultural history.\nThe visual punchline is the moment he jumps over the toll gate sitting right in front of him. Fans are wondering, how he has mastered the necessary skill. Humor in many ways is derived from tragedy, and when scenes like these unfold, we surely feel better. They are also thinking of becoming his fans in the comment section.",

    "title": "Cinco motivos por los que Carlos Beltrán debe ser elegido al Salón",
    "text": "Cinco motivos por los que Beltrán debe ser elegido al Salón Ahora en su segundo año en la boleta del Salón de la Fama, después de recibir un sólido 46.5% de los votos en su primera oportunidad, la candidatura del puertorriqueño [Carlos Beltrán](https://www.mlb.com/es/player/carlos-beltran-136860) sigue siendo bastante polarizante. Viendo exclusivamente los méritos deportivos, el exjardinero central tiene grandes argumentos para ser elegido. Un veterano de 20 temporadas en las Grandes Ligas, Beltrán fue Novato del Año (1999), asistió a nueve Juegos de Estrellas y ganó tres Guantes de Oro. Sin embargo, su rol en el escándalo del robo de señas de los Astros en el 2017 – su última campaña como jugador – complica el tema. Mientras los electores de la Asociación de Escritores de Béisbol de Norteamérica (BBWAA) tienen que ponderar ese factor al momento de considerar si marcan la casilla junto al nombre de Beltrán en la papeleta, aquí vamos a enfocarnos en lo que hizo en el terreno. Aunque sólo terminó entre los primeros cinco en la votación para JMV en una ocasión (cuarto en la Liga Nacional en el 2006) y se quedó corto de hitos tradicionales como los 3,000 hits y los 500 jonrones, presentamos cinco estadísticas que conforman un fuerte argumento para sustentar que Beltrán merece un lugar en Cooperstown. 1,500 carreras anotadas y 1,500 empujadas Sólo 38 jugadores en la historia de las L.A./L.N. han alcanzado esa marca de 1,500 tanto en rayitas anotadas como carreras empujadas. Con 1,582 anotadas y 1,587 impulsadas, Beltrán es uno de ellos. De esos, 29 están ya exaltados en el Salón de la Fama y esa cuenta no incluye al venezolano Miguel Cabrera ni a los dominicanos Albert Pujols y Adrián Beltré (elegible por primera vez en el 2024), que deben de ingresar en su primera oportunidad. Eso deja sólo a los siguientes nombres sin un lugar en Cooperstown: Alex Rodríguez, el dominicano Manny Ramírez, Gary Sheffield, Barry Bonds y el cubano Rafael Palmeiro. Se trata de un grupo de superestrellas que, de alguna forma u otra, han estado vinculados con el uso de sustancias prohibidas. Para ponerlo en términos sencillos, si un jugador anota y empuja 1,500 carreras, normalmente entra al Salón de la Fama. 500 dobles, 400 cuadrangulares y 300 bases robadas El club 500/400/300 es todavía más raro. Sólo cinco jugadores en la historia de las L.A./L.N. han sumado al menos 500 dobletes, 400 vuelacercas y 300 bases robadas en sus carreras. Ésta es la lista completa: A-Rod, Bonds, Andre Dawson, Willie Mays… y Beltrán, quien totalizó 565 dobles, 435 bambinazos y 312 estafadas. Lo increíble es que incluso si quitamos los 500 dobles de los requerimientos, la lista no cambiaría; son los mismos cinco jugadores y nadie más. Si quieres usar una sola combinación de números para sustentar el caso de Beltrán, ésta es tan convincente como cualquiera. Habilidad incomparable para robar Hablando de bases robadas, la tasa de éxitos estafando almohadillas de Beltrán durante su carrera es la mejor entre todos los jugadores con al menos 200 robos en la Era de la Bola Viva (desde 1920). Mejor % de BR en la Era de la Bola Viva (mínimo 200 robos) Carlos Beltrán: 86.43% (312 BR, 49 Out en Robo) Trea Turner: 86.09% (260 BR, 42 OR) Mike Trout: 84.77% (206 BR, 37 OR) Tim Raines: 84.70% (808 BR, 146 OR) Jarrod Dyson: 84.44% (266 BR, 49 OR) Cuando se presenta de esa forma, es mucho más llamativo, porque se puede ver la notable brecha arriba entre Beltrán y Turner -- quien no pudo adueñarse del primer puesto ni siquiera después de una campaña perfecta en el 2023 en la que sumó 30 estafadas en igual número de intentos -- comparada con la diferencia mucho más pequeña entre los otros miembros del quinteto. Umbral de un WAR de 70 Para ser exacto, Beltrán acumuló 70.1 victorias sobre un jugador reemplazo (WAR), según los cálculos de Baseball-Reference. Eso lo pone en el Top 10 entre los defensores del jardín central. De los 64 jugadores de posición que sumaron un WAR de al menos 70 en la Era Moderna (desde 1900), todos están en el Salón de la Fama, salvo nueve (incluyendo a Beltrán). ¿Los otros nueve? Muchos de los nombres que ya hemos mencionado: Pujols, Beltré, Rodríguez, Bonds y Palmeiro. Los cuatro restantes son Pete Rose, , Lou Whitaker y Bobby Grich – un par de camareros que son dos de los jugadores tratados más injustamente en la votación al Salón – y nada menos que Mike Trout, quien por supuesto todavía está activo y casi con certeza entrará en su primer año. OPS de 1.000 en postemporada De último, pero no menos importante, está el increíble historial de Beltrán en octubre. En su carrera en la postemporada, ligó para .307/.412/.609. Eso la da un OPS de 1.021, que lo ubica en el Top 10 en la historia de las L.A./L.N. Mejor OPS en postemporada (mínimo de 100 visitas al plato) - Lou Gehrig: 1.214 OPS - Babe Ruth: 1.214 OPS - Randy Arozarena: 1.104 OPS - Lenny Dykstra: 1.094 OPS - Hank Greenberg: 1.044 OPS - Paul Molitor: 1.026 OPS - George Brett: 1.023 OPS - Carlos Beltrán: 1.021 OPS - Bryce Harper: .996 OPS - Albert Pujols: .995 OPS El año más memorable de Beltrán en octubre fue el 2004 con los Astros, cuando disparó ocho jonrones para empatar la marca de Barry Bonds (2002) por la mayor cantidad en unos playoffs (que luego superó el cubano Randy Arozarena con 10 en el 2020). Pero Beltrán también tronó en la SCLN del 2006 con los Mets (a pesar del amargo recuerdo del ponche sin tirarle que puso fin a la serie) y también en las postemporadas del 2012 y del 2013 con los Cardenales. En total, Beltrán conectó 16 bambinazos en octubre y tuvo más bases por bolas (37) que ponches (33) en 65 partidos de postemporada. Es una clara señal de un jugador que estuvo a la altura del momento contra los mejores rivales.",

    "text": "Hostelworld reported “robust” booking growth across many regions of the world ahead of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year. The OTA highlighted demand for trips to hostels in Central America, South Asia and southern European countries. Net bookings rose by 64% year-on-year to 3.4 million with revenue up by an identical percentage to a record €45.8 million in the six months to June 30. First half losses halved to €7.5 million from €14.3 million in the same period last year. The company estimated global hostel sales measured in bed nights increased by 14% year-on-year, driven by modest increases in occupancy rates and capacity. Hostelworld said: “During the first six months of the year, we have seen strong year-on-year growth in our business as our customers booked their hostelling trips around the world again.” Chief executive Gary Morrison added: “By geography, Europe has recorded strong year-over-year growth overall, with revenue growth outpacing net bookings growth through continued bed price inflation. “Bookings into southern Europe and other low-cost destinations such as Central America and South Asia have also been exceptionally strong, exceeding pre Covid-19 levels.” Hostelworld reiterated plans to grow its market coverage over the coming years by adding more hostels to its platform in key markets around the world. The firm confirmed guidance of adjusted earnings [ebitda] in the range of €16.5 million to €17 million for the full year, “absent any deterioration in the macro-economic climate, the re-introduction of travel restrictions or other air travel related disruptions”.",
