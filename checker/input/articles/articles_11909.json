    "text": "Italy achieved independence from Russian gas supplies - Minister of Environment Minister of Environment and Energy Security of Italy Gilberto Fratin expressed Italy's decision to abandon Russian gas during a meeting with Ukraine's Minister of Energy Herman Halushchenko, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy. During the meeting, the parties touched upon the issue of extending the contract for the transit of Russian gas to European countries through Ukrainian territory. \"The Italian side informed that after the outbreak of a full-scale war in Ukraine, it was able to change the supplier of natural gas,\" the statement said. Previously, Italy imported about 40% of its natural gas needs from Russia. \"Today, we are independent of Russian gas supplies,\" Fratin emphasized. According to Halushchenko, intensive discussions are currently underway regarding Europe's options in the event of a cessation of the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine. \"However, most of Europe is definitely ready for this, as European Commissioner Kadri Simson has confirmed,\" the Ukrainian minister noted. Gas supplies to Europe European countries still receive Russian gas through Ukraine under transit contracts and through Turkiye. In the EU, they have successfully found alternatives to lost supplies via Nord Stream. The EU has stated that the bloc should seek to reduce its dependence on Moscow for gas. Russia is the second-largest supplier of liquefied natural gas to Europe after the U.S. Recently, European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson stated that EU countries are not interested in extending the gas transit contract with Russia. The EU has alternative options to ensure gas supply security. Gas contract between Ukraine and Russia The current transit agreement between NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine and the Russian Gazprom was concluded at the end of 2019 for a term of 5 years. Despite the large-scale war, Ukraine allows Russian gas to pass through its territory to countries such as Austria, Slovakia, Italy, and Hungary. The current volume of transit is 42 million cubic meters per day. Earlier, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko stated that Ukraine and Russia have little chance of reaching an agreement on extending the gas transit contract after 2024. At the same time, Ukraine does not plan to extend the transit contract with Gazprom, which expires in December 2024.",

    "text": "US stock market: The Dow edged to a fresh record Thursday following another sleepy holiday season session as investors get ready to mark big annual gains.\"The last two months have been truly spectacular,\" said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. \"No institutional investor can afford to be under-invested.\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.1 percent to 37,710.10, notching a second straight all-time closing high. The blue-chip index is up almost 14 percent so far for all of 2023.The broad-based S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1 percent to 4,783.35, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 15,095.14.Equities have trended higher since late October as the market has embraced moderating inflation and a strong labor market in the belief the US economy can avoid recession.Data from the Department of Labor on Thursday showed a slight increase in unemployment claims. However, the level remains low by historic standards.\"My concern right now is that both stocks and bonds have been rallying so aggressively, we really have to think about the scenarios that would allow this to continue,\" said Sosnick, who noted that bond market predictions of six interest rate cuts in 2024 implies a weaker economy.Among individual companies, Apple advanced 0.2 percent after a federal court on Wednesday suspended a ban on the US sale of its latest watch models.A ban on sales of the watch had briefly gone into effect Tuesday after US President Joe Biden's administration opted not to veto a ruling on the device's patent.Boeing dipped 0.7 percent as the US aviation giant said its 737 MAX aircraft should be inspected to check for loose hardware on plane rudder control systems.The inspection only lasts about two hours, but the issue comes on the heels of other manufacturing and production problems that have slowed MAX deliveries.",

    "text": "The Brief This Halloween was the \"wettest\" on record after the Twin Cities' first snow of the season on Thursday. Weather officials say the precipitation from Thursday beat the amount of liquid that accumulated on Halloween of 1991. About 1.26 inches of rain and snow fell on Halloween in the Twin Cities. MINNEAPOLIS (FOX 9) - This Halloween marked the first snow of the season , and set the record for the wettest Oct. 31 in the Twin Cities.\nSetting a record (FOX 9)\nAccording to the National Weather Service (NWS), the 1.26 inches of rain and snow that fell Thursday surpassed the 0.85 inches of liquid that accumulated on Halloween in 1991, making Thursday the wettest Halloween on record for the Twin Cities.\nSnow fell in the Twin Cities metro and cental Minnesota Thursday, which led to a damp and slushy Halloween.\nThe snow caused thousands of Minnesotans to be without power , including at least two schools. Wayzata High School had to release its students early due to the power being out. Champlin Park High School also was without power Thursday.\nThe wettest Halloween comes after the warmest September and October on record, with the average temperature from Sept. 1-Oct. 31 being 63.8 degrees.\n(FOX 9)\nSnow totals (FOX 9)\nWhile the slushy, wet snow didn&apos;t stick around in most places, some parts of Minnesota got up to about 4 inches of snow. Here&apos;s a look at some snow totals from around the area:\nPlymouth: 4.3 inches Monticello: 4.3 inches Sandstone: 4.3 inches Winthrop: 4 inches Mound: 2.8 inches Bethel: 1.5 inches Elko New Market: 1 inch History of Halloween snow (FOX 9)\nThe first measurable snowfall typically happens around the start of November, which is why the Twin Cities has certainly seen snow on Halloween before.\nThe most notable snowfall was the 1991 Halloween Blizzard, when 8.2 inches of snow fell on the holiday itself, and a whopping 28 inches fell over a three-day span. This remains the largest snow storm in Twin Cities history.\nMeasurable snow has been recorded just seven times on Halloween since 1872 in the Twin Cities, which is actually quite lucky considering the first measurable snow each year is often within a few days of the holiday. It probably seems more unusual this year because of how warm it&apos;s been as of late , but our short memories may forget that we had measurable snow on Halloween just last year.\nIn fact, 2023 was the second-snowiest Halloween on record. Snow clearly isn&apos;t ideal for trick-or-treat festivities, but rain may arguably be worse from a celebratory and costume standpoint. There have been roughly 30 other years that have recorded rainfall on Halloween.\nThis Halloween is tied for seventh snowiest Halloween on record.

Face à Sturm Graz, [ l’adversaire le plus abordable sans doute de son périple européen](https://www.sports.fr/football/ligue-des-champions-football/le-calendrier-europeen-complet-du-stade-brestois-861651.html), le club breton, dominateur, s’est logiquement imposé sur la marque de 2-1. Non sans avoir poussé pour offrir à son public un score plus large encore. « C’est mérité, on sait qu’on n’a pas beaucoup de marge dans cette compétition donc on se donnera toujours à fond, dixit le capitaine Brendan Chardonnet, à chaud, sur l’antenne de Canal+. Le travail n’est pas fini, il reste sept matches mais on est à 100% de victoires en Ligue des champions ! » A Salzbourg dans deux semaines Joli clin d’œil en effet de la part du défenseur brestois, qui peut savourer comme il se doit la prestation historique de ses partenaires, et les réalisations notamment d’Hugo Magnetti (23e) et Abdallah Sima (56e). Deux beaux buts synonymes de succès quand l’équipe autrichienne a simplement trouvé la faille sur un csc du malheureux Edimilson Fernandes (45e+1). Comme le PSG, tombeur la veille de Gérone (1-0), et Monaco, qui dans le même temps a eu raison du Barça à Louis-II (2-1), Brest entame idéalement sa campagne de Ligue des champions et accroche déjà le bon wagon dans ce mini-championnat à 36 clubs. C’est en Autriche que les hommes d’Eric Roy tâcheront de garder le rythme dans deux semaines, sur la pelouse du RB Salzbourg. Rendez-vous est pris le 1er octobre prochain.",

    "text": "[Accueil du site](https://www.agoravox.fr/)> [Tribune Libre](tribune-libre/)> Un pas vers l’inclusion : l’Eglise catholique autorise les (...) [#17 des Tendances](/?c=tendances) Un pas vers l’inclusion : l’Eglise catholique autorise les bénédictions des couples homosexuels L'Eglise catholique, longtemps critiquée pour son positionnement conservateur sur les questions LGBTQ+, a récemment fait un pas significatif vers l'inclusion en autorisant les bénédictions des couples homosexuels. Cette décision historique a suscité de vives réactions, tant positives que négatives, et ouvre la voie à un débat crucial sur l'évolution des valeurs et des pratiques religieuses. L'évolution des mentalités et des valeurs Depuis des décennies, la société a connu une évolution majeure dans sa perception des relations homosexuelles. Les mentalités ont évolué, et de nombreux pays ont légalisé le mariage des couples de même sexe. Face à cette réalité, l'Eglise catholique a été confrontée à un dilemme : maintenir une position conservatrice ou s'adapter aux nouvelles réalités sociales. [Cette autorisation des bénédictions des couples homosexuels](https://information.tv5monde.com/international/video/vatican-leglise-catholique-autorise-la-benediction-des-couples-homosexuels) est le reflet de cette évolution des mentalités et des valeurs au sein de l'Eglise. Une décision basée sur l'amour et l'inclusion L'Eglise catholique a justifié cette décision en mettant l'accent sur l'amour et l'inclusion. Elle reconnaît que chaque personne, quelle que soit son orientation sexuelle, est un enfant de Dieu et mérite d'être respectée et aimée. Cette approche plus inclusive est en accord avec les enseignements fondamentaux du christianisme, qui prône l'amour du prochain et la compassion envers tous. Les réactions et les implications La décision de l'Eglise catholique d'autoriser les bénédictions des couples homosexuels a suscité des réactions mitigées. Certains applaudissent cette avancée vers l'inclusion, y voyant une reconnaissance de l'amour et de l'engagement des couples LGBTQ+. D'autres, en revanche, critiquent cette décision, arguant qu'elle va à l'encontre des enseignements bibliques traditionnels et de la doctrine de l'Eglise. Cependant, cette décision pourrait avoir des implications positives sur plusieurs niveaux. Tout d'abord, elle pourrait aider à réduire la stigmatisation et la discrimination envers les personnes LGBTQ+ au sein de la communauté catholique. Ensuite, elle pourrait contribuer à renforcer le dialogue entre l'Eglise et les mouvements LGBTQ+, favorisant une meilleurecompréhension mutuelle. Enfin, cette décision pourrait également encourager d'autres institutions religieuses à reconsidérer leur position sur les questions LGBTQ+ et à adopter une approche plus inclusive. L'autorisation des bénédictions des couples homosexuels par l'Eglise catholique marque un tournant important dans l'histoire de cette institution millénaire. Cette décision reflète l'évolution des mentalités et des valeurs au sein de la société, ainsi que la volonté de l'Eglise de s'adapter à ces changements. Bien que des débats et des controverses subsistent, cette décision ouvre la voie à une plus grande inclusion et à un dialogue constructif entre la religion et les mouvements LGBTQ+.

    "title": "Hurricane Season Isn't Over Just Yet As NHC Increases Next Week's Odds For Storm Formation",
    "text": "The 2024 hurricane season appears to be never ending. Threats are still active, while recent reports suggest hurricane formation could continue heading into December. That's something we haven't witnessed in nearly two decades.\nFor the time being, The National Hurricane Center is focused on what's ahead in the second-last month of the year. The current forecast calls for movement in the Caribbean. While odds were previously at 40% for formation in the upcoming seven days, those numbers just received a boost by the NHC following a recent report.\nLet's take a closer look at the ongoing formation, and what's ahead for other areas - specifically the Central East Pacific and Western East Pacific.\n[Related ](/hurricane-kristy-is-expected-to-dissipate-early-next-week-but-it-isnt-going-away-quietly/)\n[ Hurricane Kristy Is Expected To Dissipate Early Next Week, But It Isn't Going Away Quietly ](/hurricane-kristy-is-expected-to-dissipate-early-next-week-but-it-isnt-going-away-quietly/)\nDowngraded from a category 5 cyclone, Hurricane Kristy is still causing \"life-threatening\" conditions over the weekend.\nNational Hurricane Center Odds For The Caribbean Sea And The Gulf Of Mexico Jump To 50%\nThe National Hurricane Center updated its odds 24 hours later. The most recent update came at 8 AM on Thursday. For the North Atlantic, The Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, odds of formation are still at 0% in the next 48 hours, but jumped to 50% over the next 7 days.\nThe NHC notes the depression could drift northward or northwestward.\nThe NHC wrote, \"A broad area of low pressure is likely to develop over the southwestern Caribbean Sea during the next couple of days. Gradual development is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form over the weekend or early next week while the system drifts generally northward or northwestward over the central or western Caribbean Sea.\"\n[Related ](/latest-national-hurricane-center-update-storm-formation-in-upcoming-days/)\n[ Latest National Hurricane Center Update Gives 40% Chance Of Storm Formation In Upcoming 7 Days ](/latest-national-hurricane-center-update-storm-formation-in-upcoming-days/)\nThe NHC continues to monitor low pressure patterns in the southwestern Caribbean Sea.\nAs for the Central East Pacific movement, the odds are now lowered to 10% in the next 48 hours, and 20% over the next seven days. The Western East Pacific now has a 0% chance of any formation over the next 48 hours to 7 days. Within the area, Baja, California is now producing limited showers and thunderstorms. NHC wrote in its recent report, \"Development is no longer anticipated.\"\nHurricane Activity Might Extend Past November\nNovember 30th is typically the cut-off date for hurricane season, but this year is shaping up to be a different one. One more hurricane in the Florida region could set a record for the U.S. state. Not only are hurricane threats still looming, but AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva believes tropical development might extend into December. This would be the first time since Olga back in December 2007.\n\"We've been saying it since the very beginning of the hurricane season, even way back before when we made our initial forecast out in March, that we thought the end of the hurricane season could get quite active [in November]. We still think that right now.\"\nFlorida's current forecast indicates rainy weather as of Tuesday. Following the devastation from Hurricane Milton, Floridians are hoping they have seen the last of stormy weather. History is on their side, but this year has proven to be quite unpredictable.\nStay with us for more updates.",
