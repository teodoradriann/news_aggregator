    "title": "'You're crying constantly': New menopause treatment could be a gamechanger",
    "text": "Hormone therapy was Sandra Mesic's saving grace when her\nmenopausal symptoms became \"horrible\".\nNow she hopes a new non-hormonal drug will help more women.\nAustralian doctors will be able to prescribe menopausal women the pharmaceutical drug VEOZA from April 5 to treat hot flushes and night sweats that are known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS).\nUp to 80 per cent of women in menopausal transition will experience VMS.\nSandra Mesic from Victoria was one of these women and described hot flushes as \"volcanic\" episodes that she experienced every hour.\n\"The heat comes from deep within, you can't escape it, it's horrible,\" the 52-year-old from Maldon said.\n\"Then at night, you're sweating profusely all night. There's no point even trying to sleep, you wake up and you're drenched.\"\nFor years Ms Mesic battled with ineffective medication and experienced other symptoms including irritability, low moods, dryness, tinnitus and severe aches and pains.\n\"The worst for me was irritability, it's still a miracle that the people around me are still alive,\" she said.\n\"You're crying constantly, at every pin drop you start balling your eyes out.\"\nUnable to work and \"feel like a real human being\", Ms Mesic reduced her employment to part-time hours before seeking medical help from her doctor.\nThere are limited treatments available for menopause with menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) treatments the most common option.\nHowever, a significant proportion were unable to take menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) due to a past history of breast cancer or other vulnerabilities including blood clotting.\nOther women are\nunwilling to take MHT from personal preference.\nMs Mesic went on MHT in July 2023 and said that improvements were instant allowed her to return to full-time work.\n\"Within three days, my brain just opened up and I was like, 'oh everything is nice,'\" she said.\n\"For me, the risk of not feeling well today was far greater than any risk associated with any treatment.\"\nShe is a fierce advocate for\nmenopause awareness and believes there are still stigmas and misconceptions among people her age and in the health industry.\n\"I remember going to one pharmacy and he had one box left, but it was down the bottom of this shelf in the corner behind a box.\n\"And I thought, oh what a great metaphor for women's health - shoved in a corner where nobody knows it exists,\" she said.\nMs Mesic is hopeful the new menopause drug VEOZA might increase the options for women who can not take hormonal therapy.\nThe drug owned by Japanese multi-national drug company Astellas is the first of its kind to be approved in Australia.\nIt costs $59.99 per month in Australia and is a prescription-only drug.\nHead of the education sub-committee of the board of Australasian Menopause Society Dr Elina Safro welcomed the launch of VEOZA in Australia.\n\"It's a very different way of approaching the treatment which makes us excited and hopeful that it's going to have good uptake and good results,\" the GP said.\nDr Safro works as a clinician in Dubbo and has many patients who are unable to receive hormonal therapy for their menopausal symptoms.\nAround 385,000 Australian women aged 40-64 years of age with moderate to severe VMS were not receiving treatment.\n\"It's very important for us to have as many treatment options as we can because no two women are the same,\" Dr Safro said.\nDue to cost pressures and misconceptions, some women sought off-the-shelf treatments.\n\"Unless it's been registered with the TGA and unless it's recommended as something that's effective and safe, we advise against women using those treatments,\" she said.\nVEOZA is also approved in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe.\nIndividuals should speak with their doctor to discuss what treatment is right for them.\n ",

    "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, interacted with 181 IAS Officer Trainees of 2022 batch who have been attached as Assistant Secretaries in various ministries and departments at Sushma Swaraj Bhawan in the national capital on Thurday, the PM Office said in a press release.\nTerming it a \"wonderful interaction\", PM Modi said he emphasised ways to contribute to India's growth trajectory and bringing a positive difference in the lives of people.\n\"Had a wonderful interaction with IAS officer trainees of the 2022 Batch who are currently posted as Assistant Secretaries. Emphasised on ways to contribute to India's growth trajectory and bringing a positive difference in the lives of our people,\" PM Modi posted on X.\nDuring the interaction, various officers shared their experience of their training.\nThe Prime Minister recalled his earlier interaction with them during the Aarambh programme in 2022. Speaking about the Assistant Secretary programme, he said that the intent behind it was to provide opportunity of experiential learning to the young officers from the top to the bottom of the administrative pyramid.\nPrime Minister Modi further said that New India is not satisfied with lackadaisical approach and demands proactiveness and they should endeavour to provide best possible governance, quality of manufacturing and quality of life to all citizens, the release stated.\nTalking about schemes like Lakhpati Didi, Drone Didi, PM Awas Yojana etc., he said all of them should work with a saturation approach to take these schemes further to the people.\nHe said that the saturation approach ensures social justice and prevents discrimination. He further said that now it is their choice whether they will be speed breakers or superfast highway in service delivery. He added they should aspire to be catalytic agents and they will feel satisfaction when they will see change happening in front of their eyes.\nPrime Minister Modi said that Nation First is not just a slogan but his life's aim and exhorted the officers to walk with him in this journey. He also said that the accolades they had received after their selection as IAS are things of the past, and instead of staying in the past, they should move ahead towards the future, the release added.\nJitendra Singh, Minister of State (Personnel), P K Mishra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Rajiv Gauba, Cabinet Secretary and AK Bhalla, Secretary (Home and DoPT) and other senior officers were also present during the interaction.",

    "text": "Il 2023 è stato il secondo anno più caldo misurato a Varese Secondo le rilevazioni del Centro Geofisico Prealpino, la temperatura media ha raggiunto 14.53°C, quasi a pari merito col 2019. Un anno segnato da violenti temporali che si sono abbattuti su alcune zone del Varesotto e del Milanese Il 30 Novembre 2023 si è chiuso l’anno meteorologico 2023 iniziato il 1 Dicembre 2022. Secondo le rilevazioni del Centro Geofisico Prealpino, la temperatura media ha raggiunto 14.53°C, quasi a pari merito col 2019 (Tmedia=14,51°C) ma inferiore di 0.45°C rispetto al record dell’anno scorso. Ad innalzare la media è stata più la continuità del caldo dei record assoluti, che sono stati pochi. Le maggiori anomalie positive si sono registrate nel periodo di Capodanno 22/23, nella parte centrale del mese di agosto e a cavallo tra settembre e ottobre. La prima decade di ottobre è risultata la più calda a Varese portando ottobre e l’autunno al secondo posto di quelli più caldi. A Campo dei Fiori è stato stabilito il nuovo record di ottobre, con massime di 26°C. Quest’anno la sola ondata di calore estiva a Varese si è verificata dal 12 al 25 agosto con massima di 35.1°C, mentre l’anticiclone africano ha dominato sul Mediterraneo in luglio con record di temperature e incendi dalla Spagna alla Grecia. Il solo mese più fresco della media è stato maggio, che con le sue piogge del 25% sopra la norma ha chiuso il lunghissimo periodo siccitoso iniziato nel dicembre 2021 e prolungatosi nell’inverno 2022/23 quasi senza neve. A Varese ne sono caduti solo 5 cm e 38 cm a Campo dei Fiori dove la media degli ultimi 10 anni sarebbe di 168 cm. Si tratta del secondo inverno meno nevoso. Le piogge totali sono state 1402 mm, del 10% inferiori alla norma e al totale hanno molto contribuito i forti temporali che hanno punteggiato l’estate. Le precipitazioni giornaliere più abbondanti si sono verificate con i nubifragi del 27 e 28 luglio e in alcune località si sono superati i 100 mm/24h (il record per Varese resta comunque 259 mm del 13 settembre ’95).

    "text": "Kelsey Conway Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase is one of the biggest trash talkers in the NFL and it’s not an act when he does it. He knows exactly what he’s doing. Chase is a brutally honest individual and he’s always going to tell it how it is no matter the circumstance. On Thursday when asked about the upcoming matchup against the Chiefs and what stands out about Kansas City’s secondary, Chase answered exactly how you would expect – with honesty. Bengals Chiefs injuries [Ja’Marr Chase says he will be a game-time decision on if he’ll play in Bengals vs. Chiefs](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/jamarr-chase-provides-an-udpate-on-his-status-for-bengals-at-chiefs/72051847007/) Bengals Chiefs [Bass: Why Bengals have Chiefs right where they want them](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/bass-on-this-rollercoaster-ride-cincinnati-bengals-can-just-take-the-kansas-city-chiefs-in-stride/72048083007/) Bengals Chiefs defense [What Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie has learned about the chip on his shoulder](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/what-bengals-cornerback-chidobe-awuzie-is-working-to-prove/72049150007/) “If I'm being honest, nothing,” Chase said. “They just know how to play us. They know the leverages. They know what (receiver) splits we're in. They just know what we going to do at certain moments. They throw a little double-double at us to stop the two best players on our side and that's all they do. I mean, it's not really like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad. So, not much.\" He doubled down with his comments by acknowledging he knows he’s providing bulletin board material for the Chiefs ahead of the game. “I’m just adding fire to the fuel right now, they’re going to take this and run with it,” Chase said. “I hope they put it in their locker (room) but it’s alright though, as long as I’m mentally ready to play.” It isn’t uncommon for Chase to respond this way. He’s not one to get into the fine details of his opponents’ defensive scheme or be overly complementary. Bengals Chiefs [Bengals safety Dax Hill: 'I have so much more to contribute'](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/27/bengals-safety-dax-hill-i-have-so-much-more-to-contribute/72040681007/) Bengals Chiefs Jake Browning [The next step for Jake Browning is cutting down on interceptions](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/24/the-next-step-for-bengals-quarterback-jake-browning/72025350007/) Bengals Pro Football Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame names Cincinnati Bengals legend Willie Anderson a 2024 finalist](/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/28/2024-pro-football-hall-of-fame-finalists-meet-the-15-candidates/72046481007/) He did explain that he woke up feeling “pissed off” and Kansas City historically talks the most trash to him and perhaps that’s where his comments stem from. “They can take it how they wanna, I don’t care,” Chase said. “I know what I see on paper and in game. That’s why they double everybody cause they can’t do it 1-on-1. The best player on their team is (L’Jarius) Sneed, that’s a fact. Everybody knows that. That’s why they double everything they see. They drafted two new cornerbacks that are longer, they trying to match (L’Jarius) Sneed. That’s why Sneed is at cornerback now. I already know it; I’m not bugged about it. They know I’m good, they know how to play us. It’s not like they have a superstar on their defense.” If there is a player who can talk trash to the Chiefs, it’s Chase. In four games against the Chiefs since 2021, including the playoffs, Chase has caught 30 passes for 429 yards and four touchdowns. Sunday's game has massive implications for the Bengals. If they win, they are one game away from likely clinching a playoff berth for a third consecutive season. If they lose, they will pretty much be able to say goodbye to their postseason hopes. All signs point to Chase being able to play but he did mention he will give himself as many days as possible before declaring if he will play. Chase injured his shoulder against the Vikings and missed Cincinnati's most recent loss to the Steelers but returned to practice on Thursday.",

También se trabajará en nuevas funcionalidades para la edición y compartición de clips, lo que permitirá a los creadores aumentar su alcance fuera de Twitch.\nIn 2025, we’re committed to making Twitch the best place for streamers with new tools, monetization, and ways to grow. Read Twitch CEO Dan Clancy’s latest open letter to see what’s ahead.\n[https://t.co/RhL4C7aoSI]— Twitch (@Twitch)\n[February 27, 2025]\nVideojuegos y el streaming\nEl streaming de videojuegos ha transformado la manera en que el público consume entretenimiento, convirtiéndose en un fenómeno global que va más allá de simplemente jugar, ya que mediante un estudio de YouGov, se encontró que el 31 por ciento les gusta ver a otros jugadores jugar.\nPlataformas como Twitch, YouTube Gaming y Kick han creado un ecosistema donde jugadores, creadores de contenido y marcas se conectan en tiempo real con audiencias masivas. Este modelo ha dado lugar a nuevas formas de interacción, monetización y marketing, consolidando a los streamers como figuras influyentes dentro de la industria.\nDisney+ lanzará nueva sección de ESPN en formatos reducidos\nEl auge del streaming ha impulsado la profesionalización del gaming, con torneos de esports que atraen millones de espectadores y generan ingresos a través de patrocinios, suscripciones y donaciones.\nAdemás, las marcas han encontrado en los streamers aliados estratégicos para promocionar productos, ya sea a través de colaboraciones, menciones o pruebas en vivo. Este tipo de marketing resulta más efectivo que la publicidad tradicional, ya que se basa en la confianza y autenticidad de los creadores de contenido con sus comunidades.\nFornite\nUn caso destacado es el de Fortnite, que ha aprovechado el streaming para mantenerse relevante a lo largo de los años. Gracias a eventos en vivo, colaboraciones con celebridades y desafíos interactivos, el juego ha logrado generar conversación constante en redes y plataformas de streaming, demostrando que la fusión entre videojuegos y contenido en vivo es una de las estrategias más exitosas del entretenimiento digital actual.\nLee también:\nDisney+ lanzará nueva sección de ESPN en formatos reducidos\nNintendo anuncia nuevo juego de mundo abierto de Pokémon",

    "text": "Fãs paulistas da cantora pop norte-americana Lady Gaga que compraram suas passagens por aplicativo tiveram problemas para embarcar para o Rio de Janeiro nesta quarta-feira (30). O show será gratuito e está marcado para sábado (3), na praia de Copacabana.\nA viação Nossa Senhora da Penha, responsável pelas viagens, teve cancelada a sua autorização de operar no itinerário e não avisou aos clientes que haviam adquirido as passagens. Os reclamantes usaram o Clickbus e o Mobifácil para comprar os bilhetes com antecedência e foram surpreendidos pelo cancelamento.\nOs aplicativos ofereciam apenas a opção de reembolso. \"O preço para comprar uma nova passagem hoje é muito maior do que eu paguei. Gastarei mais e viajarei com menos conforto\", afirma a publicitária Julia Vaz, 27, uma das afetadas pelo problema. Ela diz que a compra foi feita há mais de um mês.\nAs passagens adquiridas anteriormente eram de semileito e custaram R$ 415 por pessoa. As novas custaram R$ 590 cada e são em ônibus comum. Julia conta que vai viajar com outros 13 amigos, e três deles iriam com ela no mesmo ônibus.\n\"Era uma viagem planejada faz muito tempo, combinamos de ir juntos no ano passado ainda\", diz. Ela conta que o apartamento onde ficarão, em Copacabana, foi alugado antes mesmo da confirmação oficial do show.\nA alegação dos aplicativos, em conversar com os usuários, é que fazem apenas a intermediação do negócio e que o cancelamento ou remarcação das passagens teria de ser feito pela empresa de ônibus, responsável pelas viagens.\nA Penha afirma que não cancelou as viagens por vontade própria. O superintendente de Serviços de Transporte Rodoviário de Passageiros da Agência Nacional de Transportes Terrestres (ANTT) suspendeu, no último dia 24 de março, a autorização para a empresa fazer a linha entre as duas cidades. Outras oito linhas da empresa perderam a autorização pela mesma decisão.\nA ANTT foi obrigada a tomar a decisão depois que o Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região (TRF-1) concedeu uma liminar para a Transportadora Turística Suzano, de um grupo concorrente, que buscava retomar a autorização para operação das linhas. A Suzantur ou Nova Itapemirim arrendou algumas linhas da antiga Itapemirim após a falência do grupo, em 2022. A Penha faz parte do Grupo Comporte, ligado à família Constantino.\nInsatisfeito com a possibilidade de reembolso, Bruno Vargas Ritta buscou a Justiça para garantir a sua ida para o show sem novos gastos. Sua passagem estava marcada para o próprio dia, às 7h, e ele havia pago R$ 345,25. Ele entrou com a ação, com pedido de liminar na terça.\nNa ação, o advogado Mário Luís da Silva Filho, que o representa, alega que o jovem não teria interesse no reembolso e queria que o serviço fosse prestado. A juíza Ligia Maria Tegao Nave, do Fórum Regional do Ipiranga, concedeu a liminar nesta quarta e deu um prazo de 24 horas para que a empresa providenciasse outra passagem para que Bruno pudesse fazer a viagem no dia marcado e fixou uma multa de R$ 2.000 por descumprimento.\nSegundo Silva Filho, a situação foi resolvida e a empresa concordou em comprar uma passagem de outra empresa para entregar a seu cliente. Procurada sobre a ação, a Penha não respondeu.",
