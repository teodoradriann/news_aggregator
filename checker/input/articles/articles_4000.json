    "text": "L'Arsenal perd el liderat de la Premier en el derbi de Londres contra el West Ham (0-2)\nEl Liverpool es el nou líder amb 42 punts, a dos dels gunners\nL'Arsenal ha perdut el liderat de la Premier una setmana cinc dies després de mantenir-lo amb un empat davant el Liverpool. Els gunners han caigut sorprenentment a casa per 0 a 2 en el derbi de Londres contra el West Ham.\nEl Liverpool és el nou líder amb dos punts d'avantatge respecte als de Londres.\nL'equip d'Arteta ha estat de pega contra el West Ham. Una errada innocent en defensa ha deixat en safata el primer gol dels visitants, que ha fet Soucek en el minut 13. L'Arsenal s'ha bolcat a l'atac, però no ha estat gens encertat. Saka ha enviat al pal una ocasió molt clara abans del descans. En la segona meitat, l'exjugador gunner Mavropanos ha fet el segon en un córner. Fins i tot, el West Ham ha fallat un penal comès per Rice en el descompte.\nJoao Pedro despulla el Tottenham (4-2)\nDe Zerbi s'ha endut el duel de tècnics de moda de la Premier League davant Postecoglou. Els Spurs tenien una bona oportunitat per escalar posicions i posar-se en zona Champions, però s'han vist clarament superat pel Brighton.\nEl jove de 22 anys Joao Pedro ha estat l'amo i senyor d'un partit que al minut 23 ja dominava el seu equip per 2 a 0. El brasiler ha estat l'autor de dos gols de penal i ha donat la passada del primer gol, que han fet el jove de 18 anys Hinshelwood. Els locals ha fet dos gols en el tram final, que només han servit per maquillar el resultat.",

But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nMet Office warnings are in place for snow and ice on Friday across parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England.\nA yellow warning about heavy snow and freezing rain is in place from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers most of England and Wales.\nMet Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”\nThe Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling, with longer journey times likely.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.",

Listen, I had 107,000 people in new Jersey. You didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked. What did you have yesterday? 2000 people. If I ever had 2000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest, the press. And here's a great example, I had in Michigan recently 25,000 people, and 25,000 people we just couldn't get them in. We had in Harrisburg 20-25,000 people and 20,000 people couldn't get in. We had so many. Nobody ever mentions that...\"\nThe news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\nHarris, the U.S. vice president, and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has re-energized Democrats.\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Leer todo el artículo EFE Latam Guterres califica de \"ejemplo aterrador\" el ataque israelí a una escuela de la ONU en Gaza Agencia EFE 7 de junio de 2024, 1:01 a. m. · 2 min de lectura Enlace copiado\nNaciones Unidas, 6 jun (EFE).- El secretario general de Naciones Unidas, António Guterres, consideró este jueves que el bombardeo israelí de las últimas horas contra una escuela de la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados palestinos (UNRWA) en el centro de Gaza, donde murieron unas 40 personas, es un \"ejemplo aterrador\" de cómo están sufriendo los civiles en este conflicto.\n\"Es un nuevo ejemplo aterrador del precio que están pagando los civiles: hombres, mujeres y niños palestinos que solo tratan de sobrevivir, obligados a huir en medio de una espiral de muerte en toda Gaza\", dijo el portavoz de la secretaría general de la ONU, Stéphane Dujarric, en un encuentro con periodistas.\nDujarric también incidió en la postura de Guterres de que existe la necesidad de rendir cuentas \"por todo lo que está ocurriendo en Gaza\", una guerra en la que 36.650 palestinos han perdido la vida y otros 83.300 han resultado heridos desde el pasado 7 de octubre, cuando se produjo un ataque masivo de Hamás en suelo israelí.\n\"Por supuesto que (Guterres) condena este ataque. Tendrá que haber rendición de cuentas por todo lo que ha ocurrido en Gaza\", concretó Dujarric al ser preguntado sobre la visión del secretario general de la ONU sobre el bombardeo.\nSegún el Estado judío, en el ataque de la escuela de la UNRWA se encontraban entre 20 y 30 terroristas de Hamás que participaron en los ataques de octubre pasado y, además, aseguraron que impactaron contra este centro educativo minimizando \"el riesgo de herir a civiles no involucrados\".\nEn estos bombardeos murieron unas 40 personas -14 de ellas niños y 9 mujeres- y resultaron heridas 74, según el Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí, controlado por Hamás.\nLa UNRWA sitúa la cifra en una horquilla de entre 35 y 45 víctimas mortales.\nDesde el inicio de la guerra en la Franja de Gaza hace 8 meses, más de 180 edificios de la UNRWA, en su mayoría escuelas convertidas en refugios, han sido atacados y han muerto más de 450 personas desplazadas en esas instalaciones.\nIsrael mantiene aún sus operaciones en la Franja de Gaza, concentradas en Rafah (sur) y Deir al Balah y Bureij (centro), y en el último día causó en todo el territorio palestino 68 muertes y 235 heridos, de acuerdo al Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí.\n(c) Agencia EFE",

    "text": "OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. – A man convicted of murdering an Osceola County couple in 2018 will spend the rest of his life in prison.\nFederico Gondola, 41, was found guilty of first-degree murder with a firearm, burglary with assault and battery with a firearm, and robbery with a firearm this week.\nRecommended Videos\nGondola was convicted of murdering Roosevelt Dixon, 74 and his wife Janette Dixon, 72 , at their home on Meadow Oak Circle in Kissimmee.\nDuring trial, a witness testified that Gondola asked them for help with a plan to rob the victims, but the witness declined. Then, after the murders happened, the witness said Gondola asked for the witness’ help in getting rid of evidence.\nProsecutors said surveillance video and a 911 call verified the witness’ story, and the gun used in the murders was found under a mattress belonging to Gondola’s girlfriend.\nProsecutors had originally planned to seek the death penalty against Gondola, but then in 2021, former State Attorney Aramis Ayala changed her mind before she left office. Ayala cited Gondola’s age and lack of criminal history in choosing not to seek death.\nA judge sentenced Gondola to death Thursday.\nGet today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily :\nCopyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",
