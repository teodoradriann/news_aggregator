    "text": "O ex-presidenciável Ciro Gomes (PDT) virou réu pelos supostos crimes de calúnia, difamação e injúria contra a senadora Damares Alves (Republicanos-DF). A 3ª Vara Criminal da Comarca de Fortaleza aceitou a queixa-crime movida pela ex-ministra da Mulher do governo de Jair Bolsonaro (PL), que foi chamada de “bandida nazifascista da quadrilha do Bolsonaro” por Ciro.\nO caso que originou o processo ocorreu em 27 de maio de 2020, em uma entrevista concedida pelo pedetista ao canal Portal do José no YouTube. O vídeo não está mais disponível. O juiz Ricardo Nogueira destacou que a decisão é “uma mera admissibilidade da acusação, não cabendo nessa fase processual exame aprofundado do teor dos fatos narrados”.\nEm maio de 2023, uma audiência de conciliação foi marcada, mas as partes não chegaram a um acordo. A assessoria de Ciro foi procurada pelo Estadão para comentar o caso, mas não se manifestou.\nA partir decisão da 3ª Vara Criminal, no último dia 18, Ciro tem dez dias para responder à acusação.\nEm seu perfil no X (antigo Twitter), Damares disse que recebeu a notícia “com muita alegria” e que não tem medo de “coronéis” ou de quem quer intimidar as mulheres “a não participar do processo político”. “Ele vai ter que provar que eu sou ‘bandida nazifascista'”, afirmou em vídeo publicado em sua conta na noite desta quarta-feira, 24.",

    "text": "American supermodel Tyra Banks has turned heads not just for being a surprise attendee at the Australian Open on Thursday night, but for what she was wearing while there.\nThe global megastar, who has 7.2 million followers on Instagram, was inconspicuously dressed in what looked like a hooded black robe to watch the two women’s singles semi-finals at Rod Laver Arena.\nMaybe it was her latest fashion statement or, as some fans on social media have suggested, maybe it was a sign of mourning for her house in LA which was lost to the horrific wildfires.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nBanks, who now lives in Sydney with her partner, businessman Louis Belanger-Martin spoke for the first time about how she lost her home in the fires during an appearance on Sunrise last Sunday.\n“Yes, I lost my house,” Banks said. “I haven’t really talked about it.”\nThe supermodel and former America’s Next Top Model host added that she was in Australia at a friend’s house “celebrating and just having fun” when she found out about the fires and her home.\n“I just kept checking my phone, not for my house but just for friends and family, making sure they’re evacuating and everything,” she said.\n“Then I asked my partner and I said, I was like, ‘I’m seeing something here, what do you think?’” Banks said, miming her partner nodding to her that indeed, their property was in trouble.\n“And I just pulled it together and didn’t say anything to my friends and stayed in the moment, and we went home and we cried and we had our moment.”\nOthers weren’t quite so serious about the possible reason behind her choice of clothing for a night out at the tennis.\n“Why she dressed like Darth Vader though?” one cheeky fan wrote on social media.\nThe 51-year-old was only briefly pictured on the broadcast, but photographers didn’t miss their chance to get a snap of the big American name.\nStream free on",

    "text": "Delays or misdiagnoses in detecting pneumoperitoneum can significantly increase mortality and morbidity. We developed and validated a deep learning model designed to identify pneumoperitoneum in computed tomography images. The model is trained on abdominal scans from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (January 2012–December 2021) and evaluated using a simulated test set (14,039 scans) and a prospective test set (6351 scans) collected from the same center between December 2022 and May 2023. External validation included 480 scans from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Overall, the model achieves a sensitivity of 0.81–0.83 and a specificity of 0.97–0.99 across retrospective, prospective, and external validation; sensitivity improves to 0.92–0.98 when cases with a small amount of free air (total volume https://github.com/IMinChiu/pact-3d .

    "text": "P.M. storms for Friday and then disruptive weather for weekend Heavy rain possible as tropical system moves in SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Friday’s forecast looks like more of the same, as afternoon showers and storms will pop up across the area. Light winds will keep storms from moving much, so isolated flooding is possible in some areas. The advice remains the same as always: when thunder roars, stay indoors. Chance of rain is 60%. On Thursday, a heat advisory was in effect for our area, and it’s possible we have one again tomorrow. High temperatures will be in the low 90s, but dew points could reach close to 80 degrees, and that extra humidity will bring the heat index as high as 108 in some places. Regardless of whether we have a heat advisory again tomorrow, if you’ll be spending time outside, help your body fight the heat by drinking lots of water and finding shade. Boaters will see a southeast wind at 5 to 10 knots turning to the west as the sea breeze develops in the afternoon. Seas will be less than 2 feet, with a light chop. This weekend, the forecast becomes entirely dependent on the development of a large tropical wave that is currently making its way through Hispaniola and Cuba. Models disagree on where exactly a low pressure center will develop, but it appears likely that a tropical depression or storm will form in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Sunday or Monday. However, we will already start to see some impacts on Saturday. The wave will still be to our south, but its associated tropical moisture will be pulled northward into our area, helping to create more widespread showers and storms Saturday afternoon and evening. 70% chance of rain, and high temperatures around 90. We do not currently expect this to be a strong wind system as it passes just off our coast, but it does have the potential to bring a lot of rain. Sunday and Monday are both First Alert Weather Days as the system makes its closest approach to our area. Chance of rain is near 100% on Sunday, and that rain will continue into early next week. For a more detailed tropical forecast, visit the ‘Hurricane’ tab on our website. The ABC7 First Alert Weather team will continue to bring you updates on this system as it approaches.

    "text": "[Gerome](/user/Gerome)a [pagina12.com.ar](/go/link/3903510) [#39](c39#c-39) Tengo todos los de Pink Floyd y algunos de los de Waters, los de PF en formato vinilo y CD, todos comprados legalmente en su día.\nCierto que también me los he ido bajando en formato FLAC, porque creo que va a llegar un día en que no existan los reproductores de vinilos y CDs, pero una buena pasta llevo gastada a lo largo de mi vida, de la que seguro que se han beneficiado más las discográficas que los artistas\nY, por supuesto, si Waters saca algo en una discográfica nueva, lo pienso comprar, aunque sea como apoyo a la causa\n[#106](c106#c-106) Hay gente que se piensa que porque piratas películas, no vas al cine. Con la música, lo mismo.\nSigo con mis LP en vinilo de Pink Floyd y de AC/DC. Me gusta ir contracorriente.\n[#112](c112#c-112) Debo confesar que yo al cine casi no voy desde hace unos cuantos años. Por el precio estratosférico de las entradas y, sobre todo, porque no soporto a la gente alrededor masticando palomitas o con unas tremendas bandejas conteniendo hamburguesas, perritos calientes, cocacola y toda clase de basura.\nPero en su lugar también gasto una cantidad no despreciable en pagar varias plataformas de streaming.\n[#48](c48#c-48) veo que por aqui tenemos al famoso anti anti fascismo del que he oido hablar en tantos lados. La censura güena, no como la otra que afecta a las cosas que a ti te gustan, que por supuesto es la buena\nEs curioso que siempre intenteis usar el termino \"izquierdista\" o \"ultra izquierdista\" y los aludidos nunca se dan por ofendidos, ahora, dile a un derechista que su opinion lo es y... preparate para leer que Hitler era de izquierdas\nEsto tiene que ser como la anorexia pero ideologica, teneis disforia ideologica.\nTambién me he leído esta de la misma web (lo del negacionismo no va por el precisamente que es lo que me pensaba)\nhttps://www.pagina12.com.ar/586545-los-stones-roger-waters-y-el-negacionismo\n[#36](c36#c-36) Te compro eso de que \"en España no pasa igual\", pero nuestro presidente, bajo mi punto de vista se quedó infinitamente corto. Y ya ni hablemos con las relaciones que seguimos teniendo con esa máquina de picar carne que es Israel y con EEUU. Y lo de pertenecer a la OTAN siempre me ha parecido asqueroso.\n[#74](c74#c-74) ¿La relación era del 50%? Lo digo porque cuando yo tenía una empresa, a mis empleados les hacía contratos Y tenía muy claro quién se quedaba con la plusvalía.\n[#4](c4#c-4) definitivamente no hay manera de hacer un boicot a EE. UU. socio imprescindible y esencial de Israel.\n[#107](c107#c-107) prueba en otro navegador, no sea que sea el tuyo el que esté infectado.\nSi te pasa igual, y tienes opción, prueba desde otro pc.\nY si te sigue pasando pon una nota a\n[@admin](/user/admin)\nNo me pasa, pero también tengo bloqueadas algunas cosas. Pero me extrañaría que no se quejase más gente.\nAunque tampoco sería la primera vez que se cuela algo malo (ej, publicidad que hacía cosas que no debía)\n[#5](c5#c-5) Al final el sistema capitalista nivela para abajo en muchas otras areas, como el comunismo con el poder adquisitivo de la gente.",
