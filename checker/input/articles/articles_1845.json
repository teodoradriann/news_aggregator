    "text": "Weather News\nThunderstorms with damaging winds in Santa Clara County Wednesday\nThe creation of this content included the use of AI based on templates created, reviewed and edited by journalists in the newsroom. Read more on our AI policy here.\nThe NWS San Francisco CA issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 2:31 p.m. on Wednesday in effect until 3 p.m. for Santa Clara County.\nResidents should prepare for wind gusts of up to 60 mph.\n\"At 2:31 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located near Gilroy, moving southeast at 10 mph,\" states the NWS. \"Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.\"\nThe warning is for Gilroy, Morgan Hill and San Martin.\nThe NWS adds, \"Tornadoes can develop quickly from severe thunderstorms. Seek shelter immediately in an interior room on the lowest floor of a well-built structure. Report severe weather to your nearest law enforcement agency or the National Weather Service office in San Francisco CA.\"\nThis warning is in effect until 3 p.m.\nHow to react when facing a lightning hazard?\nLightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Most of the strikes occur in the summer, killing 20 people each year, according to the NWS. Chance of lightning increases as a thunderstorm approaches and peaks when the storm is overhead. It diminishes as the storm moves away.\nHere are recommendations for maintaining safety during a thunderstorm:\n- To minimize risk of being struck by lightning, when going outside, have a plan to get to a safer place.\n- If the sky becomes menacing and thunder becomes audible, seek out a safe place to seek shelter.\n- Once indoors, avoid touching corded phones, electrical equipment, plumbing, and windows and doors.\n- Wait 30 minutes after the last lightning or thunder before going back outside.\nIf finding indoor shelter is not an option:\n- Avoid open fields, hill peaks, or ridge tops.\n- Avoid tall, isolated trees or other elevated objects. If you are in a forest, stick to areas with shorter tree cover.\n- When in a group, space out to prevent the current from transferring between individuals.\n- If you are camping in an open area, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low area. Remember, a tent offers no protection from lighting.\n- Maintain a safe distance from water, wet items, and metal objects. Water and metal do not attract lightning, yet they conduct electricity efficiently.\nRainy weather driving tips\n- Switch on headlights - Even during daylight hours, using headlights can enhance visibility and signal your presence to other drivers.\n- While on the road - Opt for the middle lanes and remain on higher ground. Rainwater tends to gather along the road edges.\n- Keep clear of puddles - Driving through puddles or low rainwater areas can cause vehicles to hydroplane or skid out of control\n- Maintain a safe distance from large vehicles - Trucks or buses can produce a water spray that hampers visibility.\n- Avoid flooded zones - If you encounter a flooded road, make a U-turn and go back. The powerful currents of flash floods can carry drivers off the road. Driving through deep water can also damage a vehicle's mechanical and electrical systems.\nWhat is hydroplaning?\nHydroplaning is when a vehicle starts uncontrollably sliding on wet roads.\nThis happens when water in front of the tire builds up faster than the vehicle's weight can push water out of the way. The water pressure then causes the vehicle to rise and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road, making the driver lose control. The top three contributors to hydroplaning are:\n- Vehicle speed - When a vehicle's speed increases, the tire-traction grip and ability to control the vehicle decreases. Drive at a reduced speed during wet weather.\n- Water depth - The deeper the water, the sooner a vehicle loses traction on the road. It doesn't matter how deep the water is, even a thin layer can lead to hydroplaning.\n- Tire tread depth - Checking your tire tread before hitting the road is important, as low or no tread can lead to sliding.\nIn the event of your vehicle hydroplaning, here's what to know:\n- Ease off the accelerator - Step off the gas to slow down the vehicle until the tires find traction.\n- Turn into the skid - Turning into the skid can help the vehicle's tires realign to regain control.\n- Make sure the tires reconnect with the road - During the skid, wait until the tires reconnect with the road and then gently straighten the wheels to regain control.\n- Brake gently as needed - Brake normally if the vehicle has anti-lock brakes and pump brakes gently if in an older vehicle.\nSource: The National Weather Service\nThis story was originally published March 5, 2025 at 2:37 PM.",

    "title": "Hospitals United for Sick Kids and CHEP introduce earthlings to alien ‘Blip’ in new short film",
    "text": "[](https://mumbrella.com.au/aria-boss-calls-for-abc-to-step-up-for-triple-j-and-australian-music-822090) CHEP and Hospitals United for Sick Kids have released a short film – ‘Blip: Lightyears from Home’ – about an adorable alien on a homebound journey. The announcement: Hospitals United for Sick Kids, in collaboration with partner agency CHEP, has launched an animated short film titled Blip: Lightyears from Home. The visually stunning film produced by Assembly, Finch, and Sonar, follows Blip – a lovable space creature, on a journey to return home. Blip, though not sick, is displaced and desperately missing home. Their journey back is unpredictable, full of ups and downs. Like Blip, kids in hospital can also feel lightyears from home. This campaign will drive support to help them get home to the things they miss. More than just a character in a story, Blip is a symbol that partner brands can use to show their support for Hospitals United for Sick Kids, and something consumers can look out for when they shop. In partnership with national brands like Coles, Arnott’s, Lowes and Swisse Wellness, Blip is set to take over shelves in stores around the country. Each purchase featuring Blip or the Hospitals United for Sick Kids logo will contribute to vital funds for research, technology, treatments, and services benefiting sick children across Australia. Additionally, the fifth edition of the Hospitals United for Sick Kids and Coles $2 donation card campaign will run in Coles supermarkets nationally between April 10th and 23rd 2024. Blip’s story will be brought to life through a multimedia campaign across TV, outdoors and social media. Extensive reach is being ensured through collaborations with TikTok, oOH Media, Channels 7,9 and 10, along with Val Morgan. Newly appointed CEO of Hospitals United for Sick Kids, Nicky Bowie says, “Hospitals United for Sick Kids is the only charity that is for all kids, all diseases, all injuries. With Blip, we hope to reach out and inspire consumers to make simple changes to their daily shopping by choosing products that help sick kids get back to the things they miss.” Paul Meates, executive creative director at CHEP, says, “One highly successful product has rapidly grown to two, then three, and so on. We suddenly needed something to tie them together. Something emblematic of what it’s like to be a kid in hospital. And something that could appear on any product to make it instantly recognisable as a product that helps sick kids get home from hospital. Blip was our solution – a cute, vulnerable space character far from home.” Victoria Garcia, Swisse national sales manager – Category & Shopper, says, “Our partnership with Hospitals United for Sick Kids allows us to deliver value to the shopper and a seamless way for them to contribute to community through their regular shop, simply by making a choice at the shelf.” A range of Blip merchandise is also set to launch later in the year, with all proceeds being donated to Hospitals United for Sick Kids. The campaign follows the organisation’s recent rebrand from Curing Homesickness to Hospitals United for Sick Kids, and will help boost the over $7 million raised since 2019 to support its mission of getting sick kids home to the things they miss the most.

    "text": "For many, a strong appetite is the biggest hurdle to dieting, and even stars who strive to maintain healthy, beautiful bodies have shared their battles with cravings. To inspire their fans, they've revealed their tips for suppressing appetite. Model Lee So-ra shared her diet tips on her YouTube channel, recommending a satisfying dinner heavy on protein, vegetables and grains. \"If you eat only a little for dinner to diet, you may feel hungry and unable to sleep. When that happens, brush your teeth. No one wants to brush their teeth again after eating something. It helps to think, 'I've already brushed my teeth, so I'll hold off,'\" she said. She also suggested chewing gum when cravings are strong, adding, \"If you still can't resist, try imagining how light you'll feel the next day.\" For an added deterrent, she recommended placing box tape on the refrigerator door to remind yourself not to give in. Singer and artist Solbi shared a different tip on her channel while talking with entertainer Yoo Byung-jae. Her go-to appetite suppressant? Cucumbers. \"I didn't meet people much, and I ate a lot of cucumbers. When I felt like snacking, I ate mini cucumbers,\" she said. Solbi also noted she walked a lot as part of her routine. On SBS Power FM's \"Escape at 2 O'Clock Cultwo Show,\" she again mentioned cucumbers, saying she'd carry mini cucumbers everywhere, even eating them when feeling hungry at night. Cucumbers are low in calories and high in fiber, making them ideal for dieters. Actor Kang So-ra recommended drinking apple cider vinegar to curb appetite. On her YouTube channel, she said, \"I drink apple cider vinegar. I heard the microbes in our gut love it, and it makes my stomach feel good. It also seems to suppress appetite a bit.\" Apple cider vinegar has become a favorite among dieters for its health benefits. Dieting remains crucial for health, and stars continue to seek ways to maintain beautiful, healthy bodies without falling into yo-yo cycles. Their efforts and tips offer a glimpse into the challenges and dedication behind their fitness routines.

    "text": "Pour la deuxième saison de Victor Wembanyama en NBA, les San Antonio Spurs ont décidé de mieux entourer le Français. Et pas avec n’importe qui. En effet, la franchise texane est notamment allée chercher Chris Paul, l’un des meneurs les plus talentueux de la ligue. A 39 ans, l’ancien des Warriors côtoie ainsi désormais Wembanyama au quotidien et ce qu’il voit le fait complètement halluciner.\nPour Chris Paul, l’aventure en NBA a débuté en 2005. Le meneur de jeu était alors drafté en 4ème position par les Hornets. Par la suite, il a connu d’autres franchises, passant par les Clippers, les Rockets, le Thunder, les Suns et les Warriors. A 39 ans, Chris Paul évolue depuis cette saison aux Spurs, étant ainsi le coéquipier d’un certain Victor Wembanyama. Et entre les deux, le courant n’a pas mis longtemps à passer.\nChris Paul aux Spurs : rêve de coaching avec Wembanyama ? 🏀\n— le10sport (@le10sport)\n➡️[https://t.co/b7ToROrMEF][pic.twitter.com/vObrlML5Xb][December 16, 2024]\n« Honnêtement, je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel »\nPour L’Equipe Magazine, Chris Paul a dit tout le bien qu’il pensait de Victor Wembanyama. Ayant côtoyé certains des plus grands noms de la NBA, le meneur des Spurs assure n’avoir jamais vu ça avec le Français : « Honnêtement, je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel. Il est génial, unique en son genre. Je n'avais jamais partagé le terrain avec un mec de 2,24 m capable de faire des dribbles derrière le dos et de tirer de loin. Il rend le jeu tellement facile en attaque et couvre tellement de nos erreurs avec ses contres, sa défense... Je suis déjà arrivé à un point où je commence à prendre tout ce qu'il fait pour acquis. J'oublie parfois qu'il n'a que 21 ans et qu'il s'agit seulement de sa deuxième saison en NBA. Si les gens voyaient aussi sa mentalité hors du terrain, la quantité de travail qu'il s'inflige chaque jour, à quel point il a envie de devenir meilleur. Au-delà de son talent, il a cette détermination en lui. Je pense qu'il va réaliser des choses incroyables dans cette ligue ».\n« Au-delà du terrain, c'est l'un des gars les plus intelligents que j'ai eu la chance de rencontrer »\nChris Paul a également ajouté sur Victor Wembanyama : « Au-delà du terrain, c'est l'un des gars les plus intelligents que j'ai eu la chance de rencontrer. J'aime à quel point il est brillant et curieux pour son âge. C'est vraiment cool de le voir tous les jours et d'apprendre à mieux le connaître. Idem pour le reste de l'équipe. Tout le monde s'entend bien et rigole ensemble. On n'est pas encore à la moitié de la saison mais mon expérience ici est déjà bien meilleure que j'aurais pu l'imaginer. Les Spurs sont devenus comme une deuxième famille pour moi ».",

    "title": "“That Damn Ben Simmons”: Joel Embiid’s Playoff Failures Get Pinned On The Nets Star By Stephen A Smith",
    "text": "Stephen A. Smith has had issues with Ben Simmons for a long time. He believes that the guard hasn’t lived up to his potential, and has played a role in making others around him look ball. He even blamed him for Joel Embiid’s failure to make it to the Conference Finals, stating that if it wasn’t for him, the 76ers might have made it that far at least once since drafting the center.\nAdvertisement\nSimmons, who played for the 76ers from 2016 to 2022, averaged 13.9 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 34 playoff games. While those numbers aren’t half bad, the analyst believes his inability to convert jump shots, free throws, and even layups was the reason for Philadelphia’s playoff failures. He said,\n“Why Joel Embiid has yet to get to a Conference Finals or an NBA Finals and obviously not having won a championship? That damn Ben Simmons. I’ve had enough. I’m sure he’s a nice guy. I’m sure, Ben Simmons, hell of a player, couldn’t shoot but could do everything else.”\nSmith claimed he empathized with those suffering from mental health issues but won’t allow Simmons to use it as an excuse as he saw the Australian guard get his checks, and sit courtside for games in street clothes. The analyst said that he has treated playing basketball like going to war.\nPer Smith, the three-time All-Star’s injury excuses have been weak and unconvincing and he never believed in anything he said. He added,\n“Ben Simmons severely disrupted the Philadelphia 76ers franchise and the same can be said for what he has done for Brooklyn.”\nSimmons missed only four regular season games in his first two seasons in the NBA but has since failed to hit the 60-game mark. He was chastised for his horrendous performance against the Hawks in the 2021 playoffs and his career has dipped steeply since.\nThe guard sat out the entire 2022-23 season and was desperate to leave Philadelphia. The franchise traded him to the Brooklyn Nets to land James Harden, but the move didn’t help the former Rookie of the Year in the slightest. He has played only 57 games in the last two seasons and is entering the final 12 months of the five-year deal he signed with the 76ers in 2020.\nExtending Simmons’ contract meant the franchise had to let Jimmy Butler leave and sign with the Heat, which in hindsight, proved to be a massive blunder.\nStephen A. Smith believes that the 76ers should’ve kept Butler\nAfter losing in seven games in the second round of the 2019 playoffs against the Kawhi Leonard-led Toronto Raptors, the 76ers had no choice but to let Butler or Tobias Harris leave the franchise. Simmons’ new deal was scheduled to kick in and the team had enough money to afford only one of the two.\nThey opted for the latter, which, per Smith, cost the 76ers the chance to win the title. The analyst clarified that he is not trying to shade Harris as he’s on good terms with the forward. However, letting Butler leave severely impacted the 76ers’ chances of becoming an Eastern Conference powerhouse.\nWhile Simmons, Embiid, and Harris failed to take Philadelphia past the second round, the veteran has led the Heat to two NBA Finals appearances. Had they retained Butler’s services, perhaps he would have served the city a championship parade. Instead, the 76ers let him go and saw five years go by. Now neither Simmons nor Harris are with the team heading into the 2024-25 season.",
