    "text": "La Selección Colombia hace historia en la Copa América 2024, luego de que se clasificó para la gran final del torneo continental este miércoles al derrotar 1-0 a Uruguay en el Bank of America Stadium de Charlotte, Estados Unidos. La Tricolor ahora enfrentará a Argentina, vigente campeona del mundo.En medio de la alegría que ha desatado el combinado nacional durante estos días, el gobierno nacional, liderado por Gustavo Petro, decidió cambiar en las redes sociales la imagen de sus principales entidades, como Presidencia, el Dapre, Prosperidad social, entre otras. “Orgullo colombiano. ¡Que el país nos una!”, dicen las nuevas fotos de perfil y de portada de cada una de estas entidades. La idea de la administración Petro es transmitir un mensaje de unión en medio de la coyuntura política que vive Colombia en la actualidad.Hay que recordar que Laura Sarabia, actual directora del Departamento Administrativo de la Presidencia de la República (Dapre), aprovechó la antesala del encuentro ante Uruguay para hacer un anuncio a través de la cuenta oficial de X de la entidad y mandó un contundente mensaje.“Se vienen días de alegría. Hoy juega nuestra Selección, estamos cerca de la final de la Copa América y se vienen los Juegos Olímpicos. No solo por un partido, sino todos los días pongámonos la camiseta por nuestro país. Trabajemos juntos por una Colombia productiva, por reactivar la economía y, sobre todo, por una Colombia en paz” , sentenció.",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren - Vancouver Is Awesome",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "title": "Ex-Bills Edge Rusher Closes Door on Return to Buffalo, Signs With Contender",
    "text": "Former Buffalo Bills edge rusher Von Miller is on to his next NFL destination.\nThe Bills parted ways with Miller on a cap-cutting move earlier this offseason, though general manager Brandon Beane said the door was still open for a potential return. That possibility is now gone, with Miller signing a one-year deal with the Washington Commanders.\nAfter coming within a game of the Super Bowl last season, the Commanders now have a veteran presence on their defensive line and Miller has a chance to move beyond the struggles of the last two seasons in Buffalo.\nVon Miller Announced Signing on Social Media\nMiller took to Instagram on July 16 to announce the signing, sharing a pair of pictures showing himself wearing colonial attire. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Miller still has to pass a physical, but is set to sign his one-year deal.\nAs ESPN noted, the Commanders are hoping that the All-Pro edge rusher can regain a bit of his prior form that helped another contending team get over the hump and win a Super Bowl.\n“Miller, 36, played the past three seasons with the Buffalo Bills, recording 14 sacks — eight in his first season and six last year,” the report noted. “Washington hopes he can do what he did for the Los Angeles Rams in the 2021 season: serve as a final piece in a Super Bowl title run. The Rams acquired him in a midseason trade, and he then posted five sacks in eight regular-season games and four more in the playoffs en route to a Super Bowl win.”\nMiller signed with the Bills in 2022, starting strong but suffering a year-ending torn ACL in November. He returned early in the 2023 season but struggled to regain his speed and athleticism, registering no sacks and just two total tackles in 12 games.\nMiller did recover a bit in 2024 but still failed to make a significant impact, finishing the season with 6.0 sacks. He was also suspended for four games for violating the league’s personal conduct policy, discipline that came after he faced allegations that he assaulted his pregnant girlfriend. Dallas police investigated but ultimately filed no charges in the case.\nBills Add Another Pass Rusher\nNot long after parting ways with Miller, the Bills landed Joey Bosa in the hopes of boosting their pass rush. The veteran got off to a bit of a rough start, suffering a calf injury during OTAs and missing minicamp.\nThough Bills head coach said Bosa was expected to return for training camp, the veteran edge rusher lamented the time he lost.\n“Unfortunately I’ve missed a few reps during this offseason. But I’ve been doing my best to get mental reps,” Bosa said, via the team’s official website.\nBosa added that he is excited to be returning to a 4-3 scheme, which he excelled in during his time in college at Ohio State and early in his career with the Chargers.\n“It’s exciting for me, no more outside linebacker. I’m ready to get my hand back in the dirt, get back to the six technique and rush the passer,” Bosa said.",

    "text": "[Radko Gudas](/player/radko-gudas-8475462) was named captain of the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday. The 34-year-old defenseman is Anaheim's ninth captain in team history and first since [Ryan Getzlaf](/player/ryan-getzlaf-8470612) retired following the 2021-22 season after holding the role for 12 seasons. Gudas had 18 points (six goals, 12 assists) and 128 penalty minutes in 66 games last season, his first with the Ducks after signing a three-year contract July 1, 2023. \"I am honored to be named captain of the Anaheim Ducks and lead our team into an exciting era,\" Gudas told the Ducks website. \"The trust put in me by (general manager) Pat (Verbeek), our management, coaches and my teammates is something I take with pride. Leadership is a shared quality amongst our team, and I look forward to representing the Ducks on the ice and also outside of the rink in the community.\" Gudas helped the Florida Panthers to the 2023 Stanley Cup Final, a five-game loss to the Vegas Golden Knights. He has 182 points (39 goals, 143 assists) and 971 penalty minutes in 748 regular-season games for the Ducks, Panthers, Washington Capitals, Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning since being selected by Tampa Bay in the third round (No. 66) of the 2010 NHL Draft. He has 10 points (one goal, nine assists) in 57 Stanley Cup Playoff games. \"After taking time to assess our group over the last few seasons, Radko emerged as a natural leader who encompasses all of the qualities of a captain and the respect of his teammates, our staff and his peers,\" Verbeek said. \"With a young group of players establishing themselves in the NHL, we felt it was necessary to have a veteran lead our team. Radko exemplifies what it means to be a professional, how to carry yourself on and off the ice and in the community, and be a mentor to our young group that will become the next leaders of the team.\" Gudas is the sixth NHL captain from Czechia, joining [Peter Stastny](/player/peter-stastny-8451689) (Quebec Nordiques, 1985-90), [Jaromir Jagr](/player/jaromir-jagr-8448208) (Pittsburgh Penguins, 1998-01; New York Rangers, 2006-08), [Patrik Elias](/player/patrik-elias-8460542) (New Jersey Devils, 2006-07), [Bobby Holik](/player/bobby-holik-8447958) (Atlanta Thrashers, 2007-08) and @Milan Hejduk (Colorado Avalanche, 2011-12). There are three teams in the NHL without a captain: the Buffalo Sabres, Seattle Kraken and the Utah Hockey Club. On Wednesday, the Chicago Blackhawks named Nick Foligno captain and the Tampa Bay Lightning named Victor Hedman captain.",

    "title": "A Year in Stocks: What Worked and What Didn’t in 2023",
    "text": "With just a couple of days left in the trading year, all the major markets are posting significant gains. At this time in 2022, not many investors would have taken that side of the bet. So, what lessons should investors take away after a volatile and unpredictable year in stocks? For starters, 2023 was a good reminder to invest in the market that is, not what you think it should be. To put that in terms that any parent with a teenager will understand: Trust but verify. At more than one point this past year, you would have believed a stock market crash not seen since 1929 was around the corner. Yet, every time, equities got off the mat, dusted themselves off and moved higher. And as the year comes to an end, there are billions, if not trillions of dollars re-entering the market. But are those dollars chasing overpriced stocks, or are they going after small-cap stocks with a lot of potential but no proven track record? And where should investors be thinking about putting their money in 2024? Here are some thoughts on the lessons a year in stocks can teach us. There’s a Reason Why Nvidia Is Just Getting Started Many investors aren’t sure what to make of the artificial intelligence ( [AI](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ai-stock-quote/)) boom. On the one hand, to paraphrase writer Alan Saunders, AI is an example of life happening while we are busy making other plans. That is, we’ve known about AI for some time, yet the ChatGPT phenomenon made it impossible to ignore. The question is: Will it be friend or foe? Like all technological advances, it will likely be a little of both. As much as well-intentioned regulators will try, there will be bad actors with equally bad intentions. That’s troublesome. But on balance, AI will be transformative in how we interact with technology. And by we, I mean many who find today’s technology limiting. That means, like the internet, it’s a net win. That’s why companies are rushing to get in on AI. It’s not going to be a nice-to-have, it will be a must-have. And it’s also why companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/)), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: [AMD](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amd-stock-quote/)) and other [chip companies will flourish.](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/the-winners-and-losers-2023-stock-market-performance-review/) This is the beginning of a super cycle, and there’s still a lot of runway ahead. The Death of the Consumer Was (Mildly) Exaggerated Part of analyzing a year in stocks is identifying the best and worst sectors. At the beginning of the year, conventional wisdom was that consumer staples would do well and [consumer discretionary stocks](https://investorplace.com/industries/consumer-discretionary/) would struggle. In fact, the opposite occurred. Consumer staples have been the second-worst-performing sector. The companies performed well enough, but investors starving for growth [shifted to high-flying tech stocks.](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/outlook-consumer-staples) Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks are up nearly 20% as demand for travel and recreation remains strong. Is this demand being fueled by reckless spending that will come crashing down when the credit card bills come due? That’s been predicted for some time, and it hasn’t happened yet. The takeaway for investors is two-fold. One, don’t bet against the consumer. And two, be selective. Just because the consumer staples sector underperformed doesn’t mean there were no winners. Conversely, many consumer discretionary stocks really did face some tough times. Demand Delayed Is Not Demand Denied The energy sector did not perform as expected. For starters, the renewable energy movement is still struggling to get off the starting blocks. The solar sector is a good example of why even government subsidies can’t change the basics of supply and demand. The same could be said of electric vehicles. Yet, oil and gas stocks have been laggards as well. In September and October, crude oil prices near $100 were considered a certainty. But as the year comes to an end, crude oil is closer to $70. In both cases, investors should look at this as a case of demand delayed, not denied. In December, the Federal Reserve all but ensured interest rates would be cut in 2024, more than once — most likely. When that happens, oil demand will rise and, with it, the price of crude oil. An improving economy will also be a boost for renewable energy companies, which will benefit from [lower capital costs.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/climate/renewable-energy-inflation-climate-cop28.html) On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Pode ouvir aqui, no Observador , e também na Apple Podcasts , no Spotify e no YoutubeMusic . E pode ouvir aqui o primeiro episódio, aqui o segundo, aqui o terceiro e aqui o quarto episódio]\nEm França, o asilo assume duas formas sob o estatuto de refugiado e a proteção subsidiária .\nA proteção subsidiária é concedida aos requerentes de asilo que não reúnem as condições para o estatuto de refugiado, mas que podem provar que enfrentam um dos seguintes riscos no seu país: pena de morte, tortura, tratamento desumano ou degradante, ou uma ameaça grave e individual à sua vida ou pessoa.\nO projeto de lei de François Hollande, consultado pela agência de notícias AFP, pretende acrescentar uma categoria aos beneficiários desta proteção, a de “cientistas e investigadores” que “ correm o risco de sofrer um atentado grave e individual à sua liberdade académica devido a ameaças ou à privação arbitrária da liberdade “.\nCientista francês foi impedido de entrar nos EUA por ter trocado mensagens a criticar Donald Trump\nEste estatuto permitiria acelerar o processo de obtenção de vistos e garantir a permanência dos investigadores durante um período de tempo suficiente para concluírem o seu trabalho.\n“Temos de o fazer agora, porque é altura de despedimentos e de encerramento de laboratórios , com muitos investigadores afetados “, insiste François Hollande, esperando que o Governo francês acabe por aceitar a sua proposta num texto que possa apresentar rapidamente.\nEUA cancelam programa com Técnico. Faculdade questionada sobre ligações a organizações terroristas\nMas este estatuto não será suficiente, segundo o antigo Presidente francês.\n“Se não forem atribuídos recursos às universidades e aos laboratórios para que estes investigadores possam desenvolver o seu trabalho com investigadores franceses, eles irão para outro lado”, adianta.",

    "text": "Prevenire le infezioni respiratorie stagionali e proteggere le categorie più vulnerabili della popolazione : questo è stato il focus dell’incontro tenutosi il 4 novembre a Roma, durante il quale una task force di esperti ha evidenziato le soluzioni più efficaci.\nIn questo articolo\nToggle\nInfezioni respiratorie e rischi per la salute Infezioni respiratorie: la campagna “Abituati a proteggerti” Le infezioni respiratorie sono tra le principali cause di mortalità Infezioni respiratorie: l’importanza di proteggersi attraverso la vaccinazione Il rischio di infezioni multiple e l’impatto sul sistema sanitario L’approccio integrato per una campagna vaccinale efficace Il ruolo dei medici di famiglia e dei farmacisti Leggi anche… Infezioni respiratorie e rischi per la salute\nLe infezioni respiratorie come influenza , SARS-CoV-2 , RSV (Virus Respiratorio Sinciziale) e polmonite pneumococcica , rappresentano un rischio particolarmente elevato per gli anziani e per le persone con sistema immunitario compromesso o affette da malattie croniche .\nQuest’anno, in Australia è stata registrata una delle stagioni influenzali più intense degli ultimi dieci anni. Inoltre, una nuova variante di SARS-CoV-2, la Xec, potrebbe unirsi all’RSV e ad altri patogeni, aggravando ulteriormente la situazione. Anche le condizioni climatiche , come sbalzi termici o un freddo prolungato, potrebbero favorire la diffusione di queste infezioni, rendendo ancora più impegnativo il compito del nostro sistema sanitario.\nInfezioni respiratorie: la campagna “Abituati a proteggerti” Di fronte a un quadro così complesso, Pfizer ha rinnovato il proprio impegno a sostegno della salute pubblica attraverso la campagna “ Abituati a proteggerti ”.\nL’iniziativa, autorizzata dal Ministero della Salute e realizzata con il patrocinio delle principali Società Scientifiche del settore e Associazioni di categoria – Federfarma , FIMMG (Federazione Italiana Medici di Medicina Generale), FOFI (Federazione Ordini Farmacisti Italiani), SIGG (Società Italiana di Gerontologia e Geriatria), SIMG (Società Italiana di Medicina Generale), SIMIT (Società Italiana di Malattie Infettive e Tropicali) e SItI (Società Italiana di Igiene, Medicina Preventiva e Sanità Pubblica)-, mira a sensibilizzare l’opinione pubblica sull’ importanza della vaccinazione per ridurre il rischio di complicanze e proteggere la salute respiratoria .\nLa campagna si rivolge in particolare alle fasce di popolazione più a rischio, come anziani e persone con patologie croniche. Invita, però, tutti i cittadini a informarsi e prendere decisioni consapevoli per proteggere se stessi e la comunità, incoraggiando il dialogo con i professionisti sanitari , medici e farmacisti, e fornisce informazioni chiare e affidabili sulla prevenzione delle infezioni respiratorie.\nLe infezioni respiratorie sono tra le principali cause di mortalità Le infezioni respiratorie rappresentano una delle maggiori cause di mortalità a livello globale, con un impatto stimato dall’ OMS di circa 2,5 milioni di decessi all’anno . Molti di questi, sarebbero evitabili tramite vaccinazioni e cure adeguate. In Italia , malattie come polmonite e influenza figurano tra le prime dieci cause di morte, evidenziando la necessità di una prevenzione mirata. Tuttavia, i tassi di copertura vaccinale nel Paese restano ancora bassi . Secondo il recente rapporto ECDC , l’Italia si colloca tra il 16° e il 17° posto su 28 paesi europei per copertura vaccinale nelle diverse fasce d’età.\nInfezioni respiratorie: l’importanza di proteggersi attraverso la vaccinazione È fondamentale, quindi, rafforzare l’adesione alle vaccinazioni in Italia, in linea con quanto previsto dal Piano Nazionale Prevenzione Vaccinale, per mitigare l’impatto di un possibile incremento delle infezioni respiratorie, dovuto alla co-circolazione di virus. «La co-circolazione di patogeni respiratori come l’influenza, il Virus Respiratorio Sinciziale (RSV), il SARS-CoV-2 e lo Pneumococco rappresenta una minaccia complessa, che colpisce duramente le fasce più vulnerabili della popolazione, come anziani e persone con malattie croniche», dichiara il Prof. Massimo Andreoni, direttore scientifico della SIMIT, Società Italiana di Malattie Infettive e Tropicali .\nIl rischio di infezioni multiple e l’impatto sul sistema sanitario La vaccinazione è stata indicata come uno strumento essenziale non solo per proteggere il singolo individuo dalle infezioni respiratorie, ma anche per alleggerire il carico sul sistema sanitario . Infatti, vaccinarsi contribuisce a diminuire l’incidenza e la gravità di queste infezioni , riducendo il rischio di complicanze che potrebbero richiedere cure intensive e prolungate. Questo approccio è essenziale per garantire che le risorse sanitarie possano essere destinate ad altre patologie , incluse quelle croniche e oncologiche.\n«La compresenza di questi virus durante la stagione fredda aumenta il rischio di infezioni multiple, complicando i quadri clinici e causando un significativo sovraccarico del sistema sanitario», prosegue il Prof. Andreoni.\n«Gli ospedali e le strutture di assistenza rischiano di saturarsi, con un impatto negativo sulle risorse destinate ad altre patologie. La prevenzione attraverso la vaccinazione, insieme a un monitoraggio epidemiologico costante, diventa quindi cruciale per ridurre la diffusione di questi patogeni, limitare le complicanze e proteggere la salute pubblica. Solo un approccio coordinato e multidisciplinare ci permette di affrontare in modo efficace queste sfide stagionali, garantendo la resilienza del sistema sanitario».\nL’approccio integrato per una campagna vaccinale efficace «Garantire una campagna vaccinale efficace per questa stagione richiede una pianificazione attenta e un’organizzazione capillare , affinché ogni cittadino abbia accesso alle protezioni disponibili contro i principali virus respiratori, come influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 e Pneumococco», ha sottolineato la Prof.ssa Roberta Siliquini, Presidente Società Italiana di Igiene, Medicina Preventiva e Sanità Pubblica (SItI) .\n«La co-circolazione di questi patogeni rappresenta una minaccia significativa, specialmente per le persone più vulnerabili, come anziani e soggetti con patologie croniche. Assicurare che tutte le soluzioni vaccinali siano distribuite in modo omogeneo sul territorio nazionale è essenziale per rafforzare la resilienza del nostro sistema sanitario e ridurre il rischio di sovraccarico durante i picchi stagionali».\n«È fondamentale, inoltre, promuovere una cultura della prevenzione , sensibilizzando i cittadini sui benefici della vaccinazione e rendendo facile l’accesso ai vaccini, sia per quelli già disponibili che per quelli di nuova introduzione. Solo con un approccio integrato e un impegno collettivo potremo affrontare con maggiore sicurezza la stagione invernale e proteggere la salute pubblica».\nIl ruolo dei medici di famiglia e dei farmacisti Durante l’incontro, è stato anche sottolineato il ruolo cruciale della medicina generale e delle farmacie nella promozione della prevenzione . Il coinvolgimento capillare dei medici di famiglia e dei farmacisti è essenziale per sensibilizzare la popolazione e facilitare l’accesso alle misure preventive.\nLeggi anche… Antibiotici: cosa mangiare durante la terapia e cosa evitare Cambio clima fa esplodere allergie anche in autunno L'influenza quest'anno colpisce anche il cervello?

A discussão no palco, durante o debate chamado O dilema digital, envolveu o publicitário Nizan Guanaes , fundador e CEO da agência N.ideas e que foi dono da DM9 e do Grupo ABC, e o presidente do Google no Brasil, Fabio Coelho. Quando o chefe da big tech no País disse que não poderia por conta própria remover um conteúdo mas que por meio da Justiça isso seria facilmente possível, o publicitário interrompeu Coelho, dizendo que “esse é um dos problemas, eles não podem remover (do ar) ódio”. Nizan afirmou: “Me desculpe, mas isso é uma mentira. Minha mulher passou quatro anos na Justiça tentando provar algo.” “Ódio não é conteúdo. Não se pode colocar isso na televisão. Não se pode colocar isso na imprensa. Então, vocês deveriam ser obrigados por outro tipo de leis”. Procurados pelo Estadão nesta quinta-feira, 24, ambos não quiseram se manifestar sobre a discussão da véspera. O gatilho foi a lembrança, no início da fala de Nizan no evento, de um episódio que envolveu a sua família, quando em 2019 viralizaram na internet publicações descrevendo como racista a festa de aniversário de 50 anos da sua mulher, Donata Meirelles, em Salvador. “Fabio é dos meus melhores amigos, ele é meu vizinho, mas eu vou dar uma outra perspectiva sobre o que ele falou (antes, no painel)”, disse. “Alguém na imprensa resolveu dizer que foi uma ‘festa de escravos’, e isso se espalhou pelas plataformas de conteúdo, e a minha esposa teve de deixar o seu trabalho (abaixo, assista ao trecho da discussão, em inglês, transmitida pela organizadora do evento).” O publicitário contou que à época procurou Coelho para pedir que o conteúdo fosse retirado do ar, depois de ter ouvido do Ministério Público que a acusação de racismo era “uma mentira”. O executivo do Google, então, teria respondido que ele não era autorizado a fazer isso, pelas regras da empresa. “Ninguém sabe o efeito que isso teve na nossa família”, afirmou Nizan. Em sua fala no evento, Nizan pediu regras mais rígidas para as grandes plataformas de internet e comparou o ambiente da internet a “um Velho Oeste”. “Eu sou um capitalista absoluto, mas precisa haver um conjunto de regras”, afirmou, acrescentando que ele precisava dar “o contraponto” ao discurso das grandes empresas de tecnologia. “Fabio é uma bênção para o Brasil, um cara muito sério. Mas o problema dessas plataformas é que a retórica deles é muito bonita. Todos falam que querem mudar o mundo”, disse. Nizan, então, citou a compra recente, pelo fundador da Amazon, Jeff Bezos, de um iate de US$ 500 milhões. “Um cara que compra um barco de US$ 500 milhões odeia o mundo e odeia o mar.” ‘Não posso remover conteúdo’ Minutos depois da fala do publicitário, o presidente do Google no Brasil, Fabio Coelho, deu a sua versão do episódio envolvendo a festa. “Eu não posso remover conteúdo. Não é sobre mim”, disse Coelho, e acrescentou que sugeriu a Nizan procurar a Justiça, para obter uma liminar, o que “com certeza seria levado em consideração”. Então, o Google seguiria a lei, para retirar conteúdos de crime, ódio ou racismo. Foi nesse momento que Nizan interrompeu Coelho. A política de mediação para a remoção do conteúdo do Google envolve retirar do ar publicações e links que infringem as regras da plataforma. Mas a palavra final, na maior parte dos casos, é da Justiça, e a empresa busca evitar assumir um papel de juiz de conteúdos disponíveis na internet. “Não estou sendo muito gentil com você. Mas você não está sendo gentil, de forma alguma, comigo, com a minha esposa, e com a democracia”, completou Nizan. Coelho, então, redirecionou a discussão, afirmando que o surgimento da inteligência artificial é uma oportunidade para se discutir sobre regulação. “Isso deverá ser discutido pela sociedade, pelos políticos, pelas empresas e para todas as pessoas que usam IA.” Coelho também comentou que a discussão sobre os direitos de conteúdo em IA “estão acontecendo” e já há alguns avanços nas negociações, como também aconteceu em relação a uso de conteúdo de empresas de mídia. “Temos 185 acordos com empresas de mídia no Brasil, para usar o conteúdo delas”, disse. E acrescentou que as empresas que não querem ter conteúdo disponível no Google podem pedir para ele ser retirado da plataforma. ‘Alguém para dizer não’ Em sua fala, Nizan defendeu: “Se o Google está no Brasil, ele precisa de alguém para dizer ‘não’. Ele não pode ser regulado de fora”. Também criticou a postura dessas empresas em relação ao uso de conteúdo produzidos por terceiros, e o uso de influência política para evitar pagar aos comunicadores. “O governador da Califórnia é muito conectado com as principais plataformas, mas eles não querem pagar os direitos de imprensa, direitos de conteúdo, todas essas coisas.” “Então, a inteligência artificial, para nós, os ricos, será fantástica. Mas será preciso de um conjunto de regras”, concluiu. Os comentários são exclusivos para assinantes do Estadão.",
