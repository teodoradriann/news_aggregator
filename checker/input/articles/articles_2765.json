    "text": "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart. — Matthew 11:29\nIn November 1742, a riot broke out in Staffordshire, England, to protest against the gospel message Charles Wesley was preaching. It seems Charles and his brother John were changing some longstanding church traditions, and that was too much for many of the townsfolk.\nWhen John Wesley heard about the riot, he hurried to Staffordshire to help his brother. Soon an unruly crowd surrounded the place where John was staying. Courageously, he met face to face with their leaders, speaking with them so serenely that one by one their anger was assuaged.\nWesley’s gentle and quiet spirit calmed an angry mob. But it wasn’t a gentleness that occurred naturally in his heart. Rather, it was the heart of the Savior whom Wesley followed so closely. Jesus said, “Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls” (Matthew 11:29). This yoke of gentleness became the true power behind the apostle Paul’s challenge to us: “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love” (Ephesians 4:2).\nIn our humanness, such patience is impossible for us. But by the fruit of the Spirit in us, the gentleness of the heart of Christ can set us apart and equip us to face a hostile world. When we do, we fulfill Paul’s words, “Let your gentleness be evident to all” (Philippians 4:5). — Bill Crowder\nWhy does today’s culture see gentleness as weakness? How is gentleness actually strong?\nDear God, remind me that Jesus displayed a heart of gentleness and compassion to His adversaries.",

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "SPLC and P.E.C. Support Historic Eatonville as Proposed Location for African American History Museum [The Southern Poverty Law Center](The Southern Poverty Law Center) (SPLC); N.Y. Nathiri, director of the [Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community ](Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community)(P.E.C.); and [Bea Leach Hatler](Bea Leach Hatler), descendent of Robert F. Hungerford, announced [support](support) for the Town of Eatonville, Florida, to be considered for the proposed Florida Museum of African American History. If selected, Eatonville would lease a ten-acre parcel of the Robert F. Hungerford Property from the Orange County School Board. “SPLC and plaintiffs, the Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community, and Hungerford descendent Bea Hatler, support the application to the State of Florida’s Museum of Black History Task Force from the Town of Eatonville,” said [Kirsten Anderson](Kirsten Anderson), SPLC deputy legal director for Economic Justice. “The P.E.C. and Mrs. Hatler are in agreement with the proposed use of 10 acres of the Robert Hungerford Property for the purposes of the Museum, which they believe is consistent with the 1951 deed restriction requiring that the land be used for educational purposes. Although there is current litigation, and the suit is ongoing, it does not and will not stand in the way of a proposed museum.” In March 2023, SPLC filed a lawsuit against the Orange County School Board, related to the intended sale of the Hungerford property. “It is our position that Eatonville’s African American History Museum proposal would be consistent with the original intent of the donors of the land,” said Anderson. “Those donors included Edward C. and Anna D. Hungerford—Ms. Hatler’s ancestors—who intended the land be used for the benefit of the Town and the education of its children.” The lawsuit asks the Court to answer two important questions about the Hungerford property. One, is the 1951 deed restriction requiring the Hungerford property to be used for educational purposes still in effect? Two, has the school board followed the required procedures under state law to allow it to dispose of the Hungerford property? In November 2023, Judge Vincent Falcone III issued a preliminary [decision](decision) in favor of the plaintiffs in the case of the Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community v. The School Board of Orange County, Florida. The ongoing litigation by the Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community Inc. was [filed](filed) by the SPLC to protect the community due to a massive commercial redevelopment of the historic Robert Hungerford Preparatory High School property. “We are similarly committed to a satisfactory resolution as to the remaining acreage of the Hungerford Property owned by the Orange County School Board,” continued Anderson. “Our objective is to find a way forward for the remaining acreage of the Hungerford Property to be returned to the control of the community of Eatonville so that it can be used in a way that honors its history and safeguards the future of this community of national importance. Our mutual support of this museum is a meaningful step forward.”",

    "text": "Heavy traffic is expected across Massachusetts highways and at Boston Logan International Airport for the Labor Day weekend, prompting transportation officials to urge travelers to leave extra time and consider making their trips at off-peak times.Construction work across Massachusetts roadways is on hold through Labor Day weekend as the state Department of Transportation expects heavy traffic volumes. All non-emergency road projects were paused as of 5 a.m. on Friday, MassDOT said in a statement. Scheduled work will resume on Tuesday morning. Additionally, MassDOT said the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Interstate 93 between Boston and Quincy will be opening at 2 p.m. on Friday, and it will not be used on Monday. \"We’re expecting to see higher traffic counts across the state, so drivers should plan ahead and make safe choices while out on the roads this holiday weekend,\" Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver said in a statement. Work on the Sumner Tunnel will not occur during the holiday weekend, and the swing lane on Route 1A southbound at the Sumner Tunnel will not be deployed on Monday but will resume its normal schedule on Tuesday. Weekend closures of the tunnel are scheduled to resume later in September as that project nears completion. According to AAA, gas prices are following a historic trend of peaking in the early summer months and sliding gradually downward as Labor Day approaches. Gas prices have fallen steadily over the past five weeks, the auto club said. At Boston Logan International Airport, Massport officials are suggesting that travelers allow extra time to reach the airport and get through security screenings. For MBTA riders, all subway lines, bus routes and the RIDE offerings will operate on a Sunday schedule. Commuter Rail most ferries will also operate on a weekend schedule.",
