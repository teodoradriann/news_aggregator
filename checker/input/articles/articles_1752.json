    "text": "EDMONTON – With a series of trades, the return of an important player and some moves on the blue line, the Edmonton Oilers might have fixed their back end.\nTuesday’s 7-1 blowout over Utah Hockey Club showcased some depth scoring to counteract the end of Leon Draisaitl’s 18-game point streak, but also some stability on a blue line the Oilers have said they will need for the playoffs.\n“I don’t want to get ahead of myself too early, but after the break we were rock bottom, we played terrible, we were getting outplayed tremendously,” said Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch. “But we’ve been getting better and better and it started with our team defence and eliminating chances of the rush. And once you play better defensively, things will work better offensively.\nUtah Hockey Club's Lawson Crouse (67) is stopped by Edmonton Oilers' goalie Calvin Pickard (30) as Jake Walman (96) defends during third period NHL action in Edmonton on Tuesday, March 18, 2025. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson “You saw that (last) night. The way we were back checking, creating turnovers, countering. So we’ve been getting better these past couple weeks, but certainly more room to go.”\nThe improved performance led to the suggestion that newly acquired defenceman Jake Walman, could be deployed right-side along Darnell Nurse, an idea he seems open to.\n“I’m comfortable with that. I think there’s opportunities that open up when you’re on your off-side,” added Walman, who’s a left-shot, traditionally left-side defenceman, but has embraced the expectations placed on him north of the border.\n“You always want to be ready. There’s that standard here, you can feel it just when you walk into the room. I’m excited to be a part of it.”\nThe Oilers say they are “excited” to have him. Almost as much as Mattias Ekholm is excited to be back.\n“It’s hard to watch on TV. You want to be part of it. Especially during the stretch coming down here,” Ekholm said.\nThe left side defencemen returned from injury just in time to help propel the Oilers to open a four-game homestand with a win.\n“He’s an exceptional penalty killer, so when he’s not there, that’s a huge whole,” Knoblauch said of Ekholm.\nIt’s not that Knoblauch feels the Oilers penalty kill struggled terribly without Ekholm, but the Swede left a big hole that needed some big shoes to fill.\nEkholm logged a goal and two assists in his “transition” game against Utah, his first since returning from an illness and undisclosed lower-body injury sustained March 4 against the Anaheim Ducks. He also helped guide a defensively struggling Evan Bouchard, who had an assist, on the top defensive pairing.\nThat was the value the Oilers have felt Ekholm could bring to the lineup — a guy that can direct players into the slot and manage the rest of the blue line.\n“He’s able to defend extremely well, but also get Leon (Draisaitl) and Connor (McDavid) on good breakout passes,” Knoblauch explained.\n“He’s a guy that’s able to play other teams top units, as a shutdown guy. But able to also play with our top guys and be able to transfer the puck. He’s a not make a mistake kind of guy.”\nLooking into what the Oilers hope is another long playoff stretch, a “not make a mistake guy” should be a key factor in leading the defence as the team looks to transitioning from a 3-3-0 start to March — which included a loss to the lowly Buffalo Sabres — into the team that now sits four points out of top spot in the Pacific Division.\n“The six of us as a group, as we continue to get more and more chemistry and mesh, it’s really exciting to look at our back end and be a part of it,” Nurse said.\nNurse showed he could again a beast on the blue line after winning a fight against Jack McBain with seconds left and two goals up in the first period.\n“I was just hitting, nothing really (going on),” Nurse said.\nThere’s no guarantee that the rowdy performance will carry on, but it brings back some of that physicality Knoblauch has been talking about for weeks.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 19, 2025.",

    "text": "Lana Kelly got her first skin cancer diagnosis at 16 READ MORE: This fake tan doesn't stain your clothes or sheets after you put it on\nA woman who has had more than 100 dangerous sun spots cut out of her skin is issuing a warning to Aussies about protecting their complexions under strong UV rays.\nLana Kelly, from Brisbane, got her first skin cancer diagnosis when she was just 16 after growing up on the Sunshine Coast with a lax approach to sun protection.\nSince she had the cancer removed, the now-39-year-old has been hyper-vigilant when it comes to her skin and has regular checkups where almost every time something needs to be biopsied.\nLana told FEMAIL she has had over 100 moles, spots, carcinomas and early-stage melanomas surgically removed despite staying out of the sun and always wearing sunscreen.\nHer cautious attitude to the sun coupled with her desire for golden skin saw her become a fake tanning addict which sparked a business idea. Lana launched a line of haircare products, Auriche, specifically for self tanners in December.\nLana Kelly, from Brisbane, got her first skin cancer diagnosis when she was just 16 after growing up on the Sunshine Coast with a lax approach to sun protection\nSince her first skin cancer diagnosis, she has had more than 100 moles, spots carcinomas and early-stage melanomas surgically removed\nLara has her first skin cancer scare when she was 16 after she got two spots that had changed in appearance on her face checked out by her GP.\nThe spots were found to be cancerous and she had them removed leaving a ‘Harry Potter’ scar on her right cheek.\n‘When it’s cancerous they need to take quite a bit of tissue, it’s not just a simple cut,’ she said.\n‘That was a pretty scary experience being so young and having to have that kind of surgery. It was very sobering.’\nThankfully, skin cancers caught early enough can be removed surgically and there is no need for further treatment.\nLana’s brush with skin cancer saw her become extra cautious when protecting herself from the sun but she wasn’t out of danger.\n‘Since that age, I’ve been going to the dermatologist definitely at least once a year but sometimes on three month cycle,’ she said.\n‘I don’t even know how many spots but I would have had probably a hundred cut off for biopsies and there were different types of cancer in (a number) of them.’\nThe now-39-year-old has been hyper vigilant when it comes to her skin and has regular check ups where almost every time something needs to be biopsied to check for cancer\nEven though Lana has been to a dermatologist more times than she can count, she said waiting for biopsy results to determine if a suspicious spot was cancerous has never gotten easier.\n‘It’s nerve wracking each time. I think you don’t realise the stress until you get the text message saying it’s all fine or even to come back, at least you know,’ she said.\n‘I’ve only had one very early stage melanoma but all of the other ones would have been problematic if I weren’t on top of them.’\nLana has become an expert in identifying when a freckle or mole has the potential to turn cancerous.\nShe said it’s important to monitor moles and spots for any change in appearance or colour or if one becomes red, itchy or looks irregular.\n‘Sometimes it’s just a weird feeling. Two weeks ago I had one cut off my collar bone. It looked stable, it hadn’t changed or anything but I kept finding myself drawn to and concerned about it,’ she said.\nLana has become an expert in identifying is a spot has the potential to turn cancerous. She said to monitor any change in appearance or colour or if a spot becomes red or itchy\n‘I went to see my dermatologist and in fact it was skin cancer. Over many years I’ve become very aware of where my spots are and really keep an eye on them and take notice when things might feel off.’\nThe risk of skin cancer has plagued Lana’s immediate family, not because of genetics, but a lack of education around sun protection when she was a child.\nLana’s four sisters have had similar issues with two going through skin cancer treatments.\nTheir dad has also undergone chemotherapy, radiation and had a portion of his skull removed when a dangerous melanoma spread.\n‘I’m always wearing hats and sunscreen and all of those sorts of things. Unfortunately for me though, the damage was done and locked in from a young age so it’s been years of seeing it manifest,’ Lana said.\nShe and her sisters spent hours at the beach and in the sun as kids as their dad was a professional surfer but preventing sun burns was always an after thought.\n‘My parents were not super vigilant when it came to sun protection. They were quite young and the education around sun protection was not what it is today,’ she said.\n‘We would be fairly regularly sunburnt before the age of seven. The damage done before the age of seven is really critical. It really sticks with you.’\nLana’s four sisters (pictured L-R: Lana, Nicolette Maxwell, Danika Maxwell and Talia O’Sullivan) have had similar issues with two going through skin cancer treatments\nLana and her sisters spent hours at the beach and in the sun as kids as their dad was a professional surfer but preventing sun burns was always an after thought\nUV damage that happens during childhood has been strongly linked to an increased risk of skin cancer later in life according to Better Health.\nAs a result, Lana is always covered in sunscreen regardless of the weather and makes sure not to expose her skin to the sun if she can help it.\nHer favourite go-to sunscreen is La Roche-Posay SPF 50 which she reapplies every two hours.\n‘It’s super light. I use that everywhere because it’s the kind of sunscreen where you don’t feel like you’re wearing anything. It’s in your handbag and it’s really easy to reapply,’ she said.\nLana makes sure she gets up early before the UV levels peak to exercise or go to the beach where she uses invisible zinc as well as sun cream.\nShe also always wears a hat and clothes that cover her up as much as possible during the day and swears by linen for when the weather is hot.\nDespite her efforts to stay away from the sun, Lana always wanted a glowing bronze complexion which lead to her ‘addiction’ to fake tanning.\nDespite her efforts to stay away from the sun, Lana always wanted a glowing bronze complexion which lead to her ‘addiction’ to fake tanning\n‘Tanning is a religion for me,’ she joked.\n‘It’s a really nice way to feel better about my skin…My husband bought me a machine to do it for me at home which is so kind.’\nLana’s tanning obsession even saw her buy and ship a spray tan machine out to Italy for her destination wedding so she and some of her guests could have olive skin for her big day.\nShe started to notice the damage fake tanning products was doing to her dyed-blonde hair.\n‘I was experiencing this awful yellow banding through my hairline. It took me a little while to figure out the reason was the tan,’ she said.\n‘I went online to see if there was a solution and there wasn’t which is just crazy to me.’\nLana started looking into the issue further and discovered tanning products not only cause discolouration to lighter hair but also damage and breakage.\n‘Discoloration is only a very small part of the problem. Even virgin hair is really badly damaged by fake tan,’ she explained.\n‘The (hair) cuticles can become entirely cracked making the hair dry and rough. As soon as the cuticle is damaged everything can penetrate the hair and it becomes more porous.’\nBefore and after: Lana discovered tanning products can be as ‘damaging to hair as bleach’ causing discolouration as well as breakage and dryness\nIn December Lana launched Auriche offering products that treat and protect hair from self-tan mousse, spray tan, or gradual tanning lotion\nTanning products come into contact with the hair around the back of the neck and on the mid-lengths and ends that touch the back and shoulders which is where the most damage is seen.\nLana said many self tanners think the wispy hairs on the back of their neck are ‘baby hairs’ but they’re actually broken strands weakened by chemicals in tanning products.\nThe revelation of how bad tanning was for the hair set Lana on a path to create her own shampoo and conditioner specifically for those who love to use fake tan.\nShe spent months experimenting with different solutions on her kitchen bench while she had lot of free time during COVID lockdown before enlisting the help of a chemist to come up with an effective formula.\nOn December 1, after 18 months of researching and formulating, Lana launched Auriche offering products that treat and protect hair from self-tan mousse, spray tan, or gradual tanning lotion.\nShe created a range of products suited to tanners who either need to repair existing damage, prevent breakage from occurring and protect locks from chemicals in fake tanning products Lana said can be as harmful to the hair as bleach.",

    "text": "Cadenas de comida podrán servir en envases desechables hasta 2026 tras aprobarse polémica ley\nEn 2021 se aprobó un proyecto de ley para limitar los plásticos de un solo uso en Chile. Desde entonces, se estableció que el 13 de agosto de 2024 quedaría prohibido el uso de envases desechables para consumo dentro de todos los locales de comida del país.\nAhora, a seis días de que esa prohibición entrara en vigencia,\nuna ley presentada a fines de mayo y tramitada con urgencia modificó la normativa para extender el uso de desechables hasta 2026. Esto en medio de denuncias de lobby por parte de cadenas de comida rápida como Mc Donald’s.\n“Con una celeridad que cualquier otro proyecto de ley querría, el poder legislativo, siguiendo la urgencia dada por el Gobierno, terminó por ceder a las presiones. No existía ninguna razón para aplazar esta parte de la ley, sobre todo pensando en que se dio un plazo de tres años para que los restaurantes y cadenas de comida rápida se adaptaran al cambio”, criticó el director de campañas de la ONG Océana, Cristóbal Correa.\n“Los representantes del mundo empresarial que impulsaron este retraso ya han señalado públicamente sus ánimos por cambiar la normativa. Sabemos, con todo el lobby que hay tras este cambio, que las cadenas internacionales de comida rápida usarán este tiempo extra para modificar la ley y que se les siga permitiendo la entrega de basura en sus restaurantes”, comentó Correa.\nSegún datos de la ONG, se calcula que una vez aplicada en su complitud, la ley de plásticos implicaría una reducción de al menos 23 mil toneladas por año de desechos que se generan en los locales de alimentos.\nDenuncias de lobby\nYa en junio, cuando avanzaba en el Congreso la ley que aplazaba la prohibición de envases desechables, una treintena de organizaciones denunciaron públicamente el lobby de cadenas multinacionales de comida rápida como Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Starbucks o KFC, que buscaba postergar la entrada en vigencia de la ley de plásticos a través de parlamentarios.\nEsto también fue denunciado por los diputados Daniel Melo (PS) y Félix González (IND), que llamaron al Gobierno y a la ministra de Medio Ambiente a reconsiderar su posición, luego de que el proyecto se aprobara en genera en la Comisión de Medio Ambiente de la Cámara.\n“El Gobierno, al poner discusión inmediata a este proyecto de ley, lo que hace en la práctica es hacerse parte y lo quiero decir así, muy claro, es hacerse parte de manera cómplice de los intereses de las grandes transnacionales de comida rápida como es Mc Donald’s”, declaró en su momento Melo.\n¿Desechable es mejor que reutilizable?\nEn julio, un reportaje de Oceana denunció que Arcos Dorados, que opera Mc Donald’s en la región, presentó un estudio que afirma que producir y usar envases reutilizables es más dañino para el medio ambiente que seguir usando desechables, por la emisión de gases contaminantes y el uso de agua en su producción y lavado constante.\nLa denuncia de Oceana es que el estudio fue encargado por la Asociación Chilena de Gastronomía (ACHIGA), de la cual Mc Donald’s es parte. Además, describen una estrategia similar que usó la cadena internacional en la Unión Europea cuando se discutieron leyes que prohibían el uso de envases desechables.\nUso de agua\nAntes del proyecto que busca aplazar la prohibición de envases desechables en el Congreso, se tramitó y rechazó otro proyecto, presentado por senadores de derecha, que buscaba no aplazar sino suprimir por completo la prohibición.\nLa iniciativa fue rechazada por la Comisión de Recursos Hídricos del Senado, donde se escuchó la experiencia de los titulares de Mall Plaza, que instalaron lavavajillas de alta eficiencia hídrica para que los locales de la plaza de comidas pudieran implementar de forma adelantada la medida.\nSegún los datos recopilados por Mall Plaza y validados por el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, el uso de envases desechables consume más agua: mientras se necesitan 0,16 litros de agua para lavar un plato reutilizable, producir ese mismo plato pero hecho de material desechable ocupa 3,6 litros de agua, lo que significa un consumo hídrico 22 veces mayor.\nEso sin contar que por cada plato que se lava y reutiliza, se deberían producir cientos de platos desechables que suplan el mismo uso. A los pocos días de que se rechazara el proyecto que suprimía la prohibición de desechables, se presentó el que avanza ahora en el Congreso para aplazar su entrada en vigencia.\nFoto: Imagen artificial, creada con Ideogram.",

    "title": "Pro Wrestling World’s List of Notable Deaths in 2023",
    "text": "[Felix Upton](/about-us/#felixupton)on December 28, 2023\nThe pro wrestling world is full of fascinating characters, and we sadly lost some beloved people in 2023. Although the pro wrestling world is extensive, and full of many stories on several levels, we have compiled a list of notable losses that the pro wrestling world saw in 2023.\nThere were some huge losses in 2023, like Bray Wyatt and Jay Briscoe’s tragic deaths. We also lost some absolute legends in 2023, like Terry Funk, Jerry Jarrett, and The Iron Sheik. It was truly a year full of sad headlines, but these names will never be forgotten for everything they gave to the world while they were with us.\nBray Wyatt passed away on August 24, 2023, at the age of 36. Known for his creative storytelling and terrifying gimmicks, Wyatt had a successful career, winning both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship. His last match was at the 2023 Royal Rumble, after which he was removed from television due to illness. Unfortunately, he succumbed to a heart attack following complications from COVID-19.\nTerry Funk passed away on August 23, 2023, at the age of 79. A veteran of the wrestling industry, Funk had a career spanning over 50 years, making significant contributions to both WWE and WCW. Renowned for his hardcore style of wrestling, Funk retired from in-ring action in 2017. He had been battling dementia and lived an assisted life since 2021.\nThe Iron Sheik passed away on July 7, 2023, at the age of 81. An Iranian-American professional wrestler, he gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s while wrestling for WWF and WCW. Inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, The Iron Sheik had a memorable rivalry with Hulk Hogan.\nJay Briscoe tragically lost his life at the age of 38 on January 17th in a car accident in Delaware while accompanied by his daughters. The Delaware State Police reported that another woman driving a truck veered out of her lane for unknown reasons, resulting in a head-on collision with Briscoe’s truck. Unfortunately, Briscoe was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. Despite the devastating loss, Jay Briscoe leaves behind a legacy as a wrestling legend, having achieved significant success with his brother Mark, including holding the ROH World Tag Team Championship 13 times and earning recognition in various promotions. His wrestling journey began at the age of 16 in May 2000, and he and his brother, known as “Dem Boyz,” made their mark in ROH in 2003. Reigning as the ROH Tag Champions at the time of his passing, they secured the titles from FTR at ROH Final Battle in 2022. Jay Briscoe also held the ROH World Championship twice as a singles competitor, and their contributions were honored with induction into the ROH Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 2022.\nDarren “Droz” Drozdov, who competed for WWF in the late 1990s, died on June 30, 2023, at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center at the age of 54. Droz suffered a career-ending neck injury in 1999 but later continued as a writer for WWE.\nLanny Poffo passed away at the age of 68 on February 2 due to congestive heart failure, as announced by “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan on Instagram, with the initial cause of death undisclosed. Poffo, also recognized as “Leaping” Lanny in the WWF, commenced his wrestling career in the 1970s, participating in various NWA promotions and International Championship Wrestling, initially owned by his father, Angelo Poffo. His tenure in the WWF spanned from 1985 to 1992, and he later joined his brother “Macho Man” Randy Savage in WCW during the mid-1990s, though he never had a televised match. Poffo’s final wrestling appearance occurred in January 2020 for Survival Championship Wrestling, and in 2020, he made a cameo on an episode of AEW during a tribute to Memphis wrestling legends. Beyond his in-ring persona as “The Genius,” Poffo was recognized for his heel poetry and also for his literary contributions, including a biography comic book and an anti-smoking poetry book aimed at children.\nPeggy Lee Flower, known by her ring names Peggy Lee Leather, Lady X, and Thug, passed away on May 22, 2023, at the age of 64. A former WWF Women’s Champion, she wrestled for multiple promotions and retired in 2013.\n“Superstar” Billy Graham died on May 17, 2023, at the age of 79. Recognized for his time in WWWF/WWE, Graham held the WWWF Heavyweight Championship during the 1970s. He had been working with WWE under a legend contract since 2015 and faced health issues leading to his hospitalization in January 2023.\nJerry Jarrett, co-founder of NWA: TNA, died on February 14, 2023, at the age of 80. Known as a “Wrestling Genius,” Jarrett contributed to multiple wrestling promotions and was associated with his son Jeff Jarrett.\nBushwhacker Butch passed away on April 2, 2023, in a Los Angeles hospital. He had traveled to participate in the WrestleMania 39 festival.\nMike “Mantaur” Halac peacefully passed away in his sleep on July 11 at the age of 55, as reported by his daughter. According to her, Halac was relieved of pain after sustaining a back injury earlier in the day. Eric Simms of ESS Promotions also announced the news on social media, having booked Halac for an upcoming event. Halac gained prominence as Mantaur, a gimmick that fell flat during the WWF’s New Generation era, portraying a character billed as half-man and half-beast upon his debut in late 1994, briefly managed by Jim Cornette. After the gimmick was abandoned, he returned to the WWF as Tank in 1997 as part of The Truth Commission stable and also competed as Bruiser Mastino in ECW, making a solitary appearance in WCW in a dark match.\nAbsolute Andy passed away tragically in his sleep at the age of 40 on November 23. The announcement of his demise due to a prolonged battle with an undisclosed illness was made by the German promotion Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), stating that he “fell asleep in the presence of his wife.” Ullmann, a two-time GWP World Champion and five-time holder of wXw tag team gold, engaged in over 330 matches for the promotion. In 2020, he assumed the role of Director of Sports, wrestling his final match in January 2022 and relinquishing the wXw Shotgun Championship in March due to illness. Throughout his tenure, he faced notable opponents such as Bryan Danielson and GUNTHER, the latter expressing condolences on social media. Their last encounter occurred in the 30-man ShortCut to the Top match in 2019.\nOur thoughts are with anyone who lost a loved one in 2023. This was a trying time for a lot of people, but now we can look forward to seeing what 2024 has to offer.\nPlease use the comments section to drop a tribute to someone we lost in 2023. This list is certainly full of outstanding talent that will be truly missed.",

    "title": "Innamorato wants 500 affordable housing units in 500 days",
    "text": "Innamorato wants 500 affordable housing units in 500 days Pam Steimer was working two jobs when she was priced out of her Pittsburgh apartment 18 months ago. She moved into a hotel while she searched for a new place to live. But rent prices were “out of my reach,” she said, and often required deposits equal to about three months of her salary. Steimer spent months living in the Second Avenue Commons homeless shelter Downtown — it was placed out of commission this week by a fire — before finding an apartment she could afford in Braddock, where she now feels secure. “Unfortunately, my struggles aren’t unusual,” Steimer said. “I don’t want anyone else to experience what I did.” Steimer said a new initiative unveiled Thursday by Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato to house 500 people currently living in shelters gives her hope for others. Innamorato on Thursday announced a “bold but achievable goal” of providing 500 units that will be affordable to the area’s lowest-income residents currently living in shelters. And she hopes to do it in 500 days. The goal, officials said in an announcement at the Allegheny County Courthouse, is to move people out of temporary shelters into permanent housing. That would provide people now staying in shelters with the chance to live in permanent, dignified housing, while also opening up shelter beds for those now sleeping on the streets. Innamorato is partnering with city, state and federal officials, landlords, philanthropic organizations and others to reach her goal. The effort could involve converting existing buildings like hotels or nursing homes; repairing apartments that are not currently in use; or identifying properties with landlords willing to partner on the project to make their housing affordable to people coming out of shelters. RK Mellon Foundation, the Hillman Foundation and the Heinz Endowments will each kick in $1 million. Eden Hall will contribute $375,000. And a government grant will add another $3 million. The program, officials said, will include support for both the people leaving shelter and their new landlords. Already, 75 housing units have been offered up for the initiative from Action Housing, Brandywine Communities and Rising Tide Partners, Innamorato said. For the county executive, housing issues are personal. She said she was 15 when she came home from school one day to the news from her mother that they were leaving their home. Innamorato lived in 10 different places from then until her high school graduation. “It was a life of uncertainty, a life no one deserves,” she said. Data shows that Allegheny County’s homelessness has been on the rise. Last year, there was an average of 169 unsheltered people in Allegheny County, up from an average of 65 in 2021, according to the county’s Department of Human Services. People are staying longer in shelters and not migrating to more permanent housing, officials said, leading to more people on the street. County shelters have seen a 40% rise in length of stays. Likely driving that increase are what the county calls “low-risk” individuals such as Steimer. Those are people struggling economically who don’t qualify for special programs, who have less contact with mental health and criminal justice systems, and who have fewer issues with substance abuse. Many of them have jobs or some kind of income, but they don’t make enough to pay for housing, which has gotten more expensive in Allegheny County and across the country. County officials want to increase the flow in and out of shelters by making permanent affordable housing units available. They will start by providing those units to low-risk individuals. They make up about 75% of the people in shelters in Allegheny County. Though officials just announced the program, they’re already making progress in helping people transition from shelter into housing, said Erin Dalton, director of the county’s Department of Human Services. Last year, only a dozen people made the move to permanent public housing, Dalton said. Last month alone, 20 people made that jump. “We know that housing’s about so much more than a roof and walls,” said U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, D-Swissvale, who joined Steimer, Innamorato and Dalton at the press conference. “It plays a role in every aspect of our lives.” People shouldn’t have to pick between paying rent and putting food on the table, Lee said. The congresswoman is working to secure federal funding for the initiative. The Heinz Endowments intends to use its donation for a program at the former Vincentian de Marillac facility in Pittsburgh’s Stanton Heights neighborhood that would provide shelter and services for up to 56 people at a time for up to six months and would focus on helping people move into permanent housing.

    "text": "El personal de Salud Pública se beneficiará de un aumento en los ingresos. Autor: Roberto Suárez Publicado: 28/12/2023 | 11:32 pm\nComo parte de las proyecciones del Gobierno para corregir distorsiones y reimpulsar la economía, una de las decisiones de mayor impacto anunciadas recientemente en el 2do. Período Ordinario de Sesiones de la Asamblea Nacional del Poder Popular en su 10ma. Legislatura, está relacionada con el incremento de los ingresos y mejoras en la atención al personal de los sectores de Educación, Educación Superior y Salud Pública, pilares muy vinculados con la esencia misma de la Revolución.\nEn tal sentido, la viceministra de Finanzas y Precios, Maritza Cruz García, explicó este jueves en el espacio televisivo Mesa Redonda que se trata de dos sectores estratégicos priorizados en todo momento desde el presupuesto del Estado, aun en las condiciones adversas que atravesamos.\nPor ello para 2024, dijo, el 63 por ciento del gasto total del presupuesto estará dedicado a los sectores de salud, educación, la asistencia y la seguridad social, cultura y deporte. En el caso de Salud Pública, precisó, recibe un 26 por ciento del gasto total y la educación un 20 por ciento.\nAunque no existe capacidad para un incremento masivo en todos los sectores, en específico el Gobierno cubano decidió reconocer la Salud y la Educación, aclaró, por la necesidad que tenemos de estabilizar la fuerza laboral especializada en esas esferas para mejorar la calidad de vida y de enseñanza. Estamos hablando de más de un millón de trabajadores entre ambas, aseguró.\nLa Viceministra de Finanzas y Precios recordó que esta es una medida parcial que incluye también instituciones de la cultura y el deporte, al tiempo que comentó que en la medida en que logremos generar mayores ingresos, el país podrá ampliar estos beneficios a otros sectores estratégicos de la sociedad.\nMás de 25 000 millones de pesos de incremento se erogarán para respaldar este gasto dentro del presupuesto. Por lo que Cruz García aclaró que este paso requiere más control para supervisar que el efecto de las medidas sea positivo, y que su diseño e implementación sean los adecuados, para garantizar que se aseguren los recursos financieros necesarios.\nMás motivaciones\nEl viceministro de Salud Pública, Luis Fernando Navarro Martínez, detalló que ese sector agrupa a más de 409 000 trabajadores, y reconoció el esfuerzo del país para respaldar desde el presupuesto del Estado todos los servicios de salud gratuitos.\nEn total son 22 medidas dispuestas, y de ellas cuatro resultan fundamentales por estar relacionadas con los ingresos de los trabajadores, sobre todo, aquellos profesionales y técnicos vinculados directamente con los servicios médicos.\nSobre el incremento salarial a los trabajadores que surtirá efecto a partir del 1ro. de enero, consideró que debe tener un impacto positivo en lo inmediato. La primera de estas medidas va encaminada al pago mensual por años de servicio a médicos, estomatólogos, personal de enfermería, sicólogos, tecnólogos y técnicos.\nAsimismo, significó que a partir de los 30 años trabajados cada dos años corresponde un incremento de 400 pesos mensuales. Esta justa recompensa para el personal con tiempo de antigüedad en el sector debe beneficiar a más 212 000 trabajadores.\nAdemás, aclaró, en el caso de los trabajadores de las universidades de Ciencias Médicas, recibirán el pago por servicio acorde con lo establecido por el Ministerio de Educación Superior.\nEntretanto, la segunda medida anunciada por el Viceministro de Salud Pública es el incremento de la tarifa de las guardias nocturnas (horas trabajadas). En el caso del personal médico y de estomatología, la tarifa quedó fijada en los 50 pesos la hora de lunes a viernes, desde las siete de la noche hasta las siete de la mañana, mientras que los sábados se comienza a contar a partir del mediodía, y los domingos desde las siete de la mañana.\nEn el caso del personal de enfermería, refirió, la tarifa es de 40 pesos la hora de siete de la noche a las siete de la mañana, y para los tecnólogos de la salud resultará de 30 pesos también por horas de trabajo en sus guardias nocturnas.\nPara reconocer el esfuerzo de profesionales en condiciones especiales se aprobó igualmente un pago adicional a médicos, estomatólogos, personal de enfermería, sicólogos, tecnólogos, farmacéuticos y otros profesionales técnicos que trabajan directamente en los servicios de la salud de mayor demanda asistencial con un nivel importante de responsabilidad.\nPara ello, según explicó, se establecieron cinco grupos de condiciones especiales de trabajo, aplicables a médicos y estomatólogos, que incluyen servicios brindados, desde la atención primaria de salud hasta las más complejas en la actividad secundaria y terciaria.\nLos del primer grupo tienen tres pesos la hora, el segundo 4,50 pesos por hora, el tercero seis pesos por hora, el cuarto 7,80 y el quinto nueve pesos por hora. Para el personal de enfermería y otros técnicos, las tarifas fueron fijadas para el primer grupo en 1,20 pesos por hora, el segundo en 2,30 pesos la hora y un tercer grupo en 3,50 pesos la hora. Precisó el Viceministro que este pago se suma al de la escala salarial, los años de antigüedad y las guardias nocturnas.\nMientras que una cuarta medida va encaminada al incremento de ingresos por carga docente, asistencial, investigativa y de otros servicios. O sea, hacia aquellos trabajadores que cubren, además de su puesto, otras plazas importantes. Para quienes estén en esta condición, informó, la cuantía máxima a pagar puede llegar a ser hasta de un ciento por ciento del salario escala del cargo que ocupa el trabajador.\nEl resto de las medidas del sector, comentó, se irán implementando paulatinamente en 2024. Por su parte Santiago Abadía, secretario general del Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Salud, precisó que no se trata de una reforma salarial, sino de medidas que necesitábamos y que reclamaba nuestro pueblo y personal de salud.\nOtro sector que se beneficia\nAl igual que sucede en la Salud, para los docentes cubanos y personal de educación, las medidas anunciadas en el Parlamento cubano se aprecian con una aceptación general y de gran impacto, según lo expresado en el espacio televisivo por la ministra de Educación, Naima Ariatne Trujillo Barreto.\nDijo la Ministra que es este un programa integral y abarcador que se implementará en todos los niveles de Educación, pues estamos hablando del sistema educacional más amplio del país. Todo ello ha exigido ajustar resoluciones e idear nuevos procedimientos. Todo lo que se va a hacer, aseguró, ha tenido una participación y discusión, por lo que la ampliación de estas disposiciones se irá realizando en la medida en que las condiciones del país lo permitan.\nPero una de las medidas más importantes para el sector radica en el pago adicional por antigüedad, que tiene como novedad que se involucra ahora tanto a trabajadores docentes como no docentes. Y con ello, subrayó Trujillo Barreto, se beneficiará de un modo u otro a 240 000 trabajadores del gremio. Añadió que el rango de los 30 años de trabajo es donde se encuentra el mayor número de personal en este sector.\nPara los profesores de las escuelas pedagógicas y los IPVCE, habrá igualmente un tratamiento diferenciado, aclaró. Asimismo, la remuneración por sobrecarga docente fue abordada por la Ministra de Educación, quien informó que serán estimuladas personas que, además de cumplir con la actividad que normalmente corresponde a un docente de un nivel educativo, asumen condiciones especiales para cumplir con las labores que correspondería a un profesor que hoy no tenemos. Aquí también se entiende a los trabajadores no docentes, agregó, llegando en cualquier caso, hasta una retribución del ciento por ciento del salario.\nPor su parte, el Ministro de Educación Superior, Walter Baluja Martínez, aseveró que la principal motivación hasta hoy no ha sido el salario propiamente en estos sectores, de ahí que las medidas sean tan relevantes e importantes.\nEn materia presupuestaria, comentó, más del diez por ciento estará dedicado al pago por antigüedad del personal de la Educación Superior. También está concebido, al igual que en la educación general, el pago por la sobrecarga docente, en un sector donde ha crecido la matrícula en los últimos años.\nHay otras medidas, recordó, que no se implementarán de inmediato y que tienen que ver con el pago de aquellos docentes que colaboran y realizan proyectos de carácter internacional. Además, al referirse a la estimulación moral en la Educación Superior, significó que es también un aspecto importante, porque resulta una de las vías más relevantes para mantener reconocido a cada trabajador.\nIncremento Salarial por antigüedad\nMinisterio de Educación y Educación Superior.\nMinisterio de Salud Pública",

    "text": "Srinagar, Oct 24: The Jammu Kashmir Press Corps (JKPC) has raised concerns regarding certain individuals posing as editors and allegedly operating media organizations in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). These individuals are reportedly engaged in defamation and blackmail, particularly targeting government officials, undermining efforts to promote transparency and fairness within the region’s press. “Journalists have been seen as custodians of public interest, bridging the gap between the government and the people. Their role in highlighting the issues faced by ordinary citizens and raising awareness about government initiatives aimed at public welfare is a cornerstone of democracy,” the statement said. However, in J&K, unethical practices have compromised the media’s integrity and the values it is meant to uphold. Before 2019, a select few media organizations in J&K monopolized the journalistic landscape, fostering radicalization and engaging in blackmail against various government departments, including the J&K Information Department. This unethical conduct severely damaged the integrity of journalism in the region, turning the media into a tool for personal gain rather than serving as a watchdog for society. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi post-2019, significant reforms were introduced to rectify this situation. The media sector, particularly newspaper organizations, underwent a much-needed overhaul, restoring a sense of fairness and transparency in the distribution of government advertisements. The J&K Information Department ensured that all newspapers received their rightful share based on merit rather than coercion or manipulation. Recently, however, troubling reports have emerged suggesting that some of the same unscrupulous elements within the media fraternity are resorting to blackmail tactics once again. These individuals, often referred to as the “black sheep” of the newspaper community, are allegedly pressuring officials within the J&K Information Department. The actions of these individuals have not only tarnished the reputation of the entire journalistic community in Kashmir but have also turned their newspapers into tools for defamation and blackmail. They are accused of launching personal attacks against officials from various government departments, particularly those within the J&K Information Department, even going so far as to malign their private lives. Adding to the concern is the involvement of these so-called journalists and editors, some of whom are facing criminal charges and have been booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA). They are reportedly using their influence with newly elected legislators to further their own interests, undermining the transparency of government operations and harming both the personal and professional lives of their victims. This resurgence of unethical behavior has fostered a climate of fear, with innocent individuals being blackmailed under the guise of journalism. Many of these so-called “Litho newspapers” are printing only 50 to 100 copies to mislead the government. As the largest and only registered journalist association in J&K, the JKPC is deeply troubled by these developments. The organization urges the Prime Minister to take swift and decisive action against these blackmailers, emphasizing the need for accountability to prevent further degradation of the media’s credibility in J&K. Only through stringent measures can the press maintain its role as a force for truth and accountability rather than a tool for personal vendettas and corrupt practices. In response to these issues, the JKPC has resolved to send letters containing the names of alleged blackmailer editors and fraudulent media houses to the Prime Minister’s Office, the Home Minister’s Office, and the Chairperson of the Press Council of India.
