    "title": "Palestinian-Jordanian Journalist: The West Stole Christianity From Us, Just As It Stole Palestine; Jesus Was The First Palestinian Fida'i | MEMRI",
    "text": "Hamada Fara'neh, a Palestinian-Jordanian journalist and author who is also a member of the Palestinian National Council, recently published an an article titled \"They Stole Christianity from Us\" in the Jordanian daily Al-Dustour and the Palestinian daily Al-Quds. In the article he claimed that Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem and lived in Palestine, was a Palestinian and that the West stole Christianity from the Palestinians, just as it later stole Palestine itself and settled it with Jews. This, he said, is why the West and its churches support Israel and do not come out against the crimes it commits against the Palestinian people. He added that, just as Jesus – who was the first Palestinian fida'i (self-sacrificing fighter) and an emblem of sacrifice for the sake of others – was crucified as a result of a pact between Judas Iscariot and the Roman colonialists, the Palestinians people are now victims of a pact between Israel and the colonialist West, headed by the U.S. It should be noted that this is not the first time Palestinians draw a link between Jesus and the Palestinian national struggle. [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_edn1) Hamada Fara'neh (Image: Alqalahnews.net) The following are translated excerpts from Fara'neh's article: [[2]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_edn2) \"Jesus was not a Roman but a Palestinian. He was born in Bethlehem, his divine revelation and his resurrection occurred in Palestine, and he was baptized in the Jordan River, for Jordan-Palestine was his homeland and the homeland of his disciples and his message. SUPPORT OUR WORK \"He was not a European from Moscow or London, or from anywhere else outside out region, although his message transcends borders and his followers come from every nation and continent – just as Islam transcends borders and nations, and its followers are not confined to the Arabian Peninsula but come from all over the Arab world and every continent: from Asia through Africa to Europe and America. Religion has no homeland; it spreads in an effort to embrace all of human existence, for it is a divine message to human beings everywhere. \"The West stole Christianity from us, from our people, just as it did with Palestine, which was openly stolen by British imperialism. [This was done] by means of the Balfur Declaration, so as to bring all the foreign Jews together, help them emigrate [to Palestine] and settle them by force in the Palestinians' land at the Palestinians' expense. But no matter how large and strong the Israeli colony becomes, it will never be entitled to steal [the Palestinians' land] – as long as the Palestinian people remain alive and productive, its women remain fertile and its men remain willing to act, sacrifice and cleave to their homeland, their honor and their rights, which cannot be made to evaporate or be forgotten and do not expire with time. \"They [the Westerners] stole the Christian religion from our land, just as they stole Palestine [itself], and that is why they have not come out against the horrific violent takeover, the killing and the destruction [wreaked by Israel against the Palestinian] people and the residents of the cities, villages and neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip. [The Israelis] did this before, in 1948, but without being scrutinized, filmed and monitored. They inherited this behavior from their predecessors, for they did to the Palestinians what Tsarist Russia, German Nazism and Italian Fascism did to them. \"They [the Westerners] stole the Christian religion from us, and that is why the patriarchs and archbishops [of the Western churches] have not stood up against what the [military] forces of the [Israeli] colony are doing to the Christians and Muslims in Palestine, the land of Jesus. And this is despite the fact that the three Palestinian churches – the Church of the Nativity [in Bethlehem], the Church of the Annunciation [in Nazareth] and the Church of the Sepulcher [in Jerusalem] – are lamenting along with their people and their worshippers in Palestine, for their people, churches, schools, hospitals and family homes are in Gaza. His Holiness the Pope confirmed this in his Christmas message, which addressed the horrors of the heavy disaster that the Palestinian people are experiencing at the hands of the Israeli imperialists. \"The Palestinian people is facing death, murder, execution and destruction, along with starvation, shortage and the loss of the right to life. The churches of London and Moscow and their branches do not feel the pain and suffering of the Palestinian Christians and Muslims. \"Christmas, the festival [marking] the birth of Jesus – who was the first Palestinian and first fida'i, characterized by sacrifice, altruism and an untimely death – [will be marked this year] without joy, because the Palestinian people are being crucified in their own homeland, just like Jesus [was crucified] because of a pact between the Roman imperialism of his era and the treason of Judas Iscariot. Today, too, the cruelty, racism, fascism, and disgraceful actions of the [Israeli] colony [are met with] treason against the values of humanity by those who support [Israel], stand with it, help it, lend it political backing and protect it from accountability. This is what the U.S. administration did when it provided Israel with 230 cargo planes and 30 cargo vessels [loaded with] weapons, bombs and means of destruction. [These weapons are now] killing the Palestinians, both Christians and Muslims, who honor [Christ], the Messenger of Love and Peace, just as they love all the messengers and prophets, chief of them [Muhammad], the Messenger and Prophet of the Muslims.\" [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_ednref1) See e.g., MEMRI Special Dispatch 9135, [Palestinian Authority Commemorates, Glorifies Terrorists In 'Martyr Day' Events; Article In PA Daily: Jesus Was The First Palestinian Martyr](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-authority-commemorates-glorifies-terrorists-martyr-day-events-article-pa-daily), January 12, 2021.

    "text": "C’est l’une des caractéristiques du littoral italien qui interpelle le plus les touristes français et, souvent, les indispose. De l’autre côté des Alpes, les plages, en particulier celles faciles d’accès, sont souvent privatisées. Cela ne signifie pas que l’accès à la mer est interdit (ce qui serait illégal), mais que le sable est occupé par une nuée de transats et de parasols multicolores en location, qui quadrillent pratiquement tout l’espace disponible. Dans certaines villes, comme Rimini, en Émilie-Romagne, plus de 90 % du littoral est ainsi “privatisé”. Mais, outre le manque d’espace libre, ce système particulier de gestion des plages apporte un autre problème, face auquel la politique transalpine reste paralysée depuis une bonne dizaine d’années. [Le site d’information Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2024/08/01/mare-libero-spiagge-concessioni/), spécialiste des décryptages, le résume ainsi. “Depuis des décennies, les concessions pour l’exploitation des plages sont automatiquement renouvelées au bénéfice des mêmes propriétaires, qui paient souvent à l’État des ‘loyers’ dérisoires.” Une absence de mise en concurrence d’un bien public qui va à l’encontre de la directive Bolkestein, approuvée en 2006.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Счетная палата: Выделенные на школьный интернет деньги потрачены неэффективно. Учителя говорят, что пользоваться сетью невозможно\nСчетная палата выявила неэффективность расходования бюджетных денег при подключении к интернету школ и избиркомов. Для этих целей только в 2024 г. Минцифры заключено четыре контракта с «Ростелекомом» на общую сумму 7,5 млрд руб.\nОтчет Счетной палаты\nСчетная палата признала «недостаточно эффективным» расходование федерального бюджета на подключение образовательных организаций и избирательных комиссий к интернету. Очередная проверка проводилась по поручению Президента. Отчет опубликован на официальном сайте Счетной палаты.\nОпрос более 25 тыс. учебных заведений общего и среднего специального образования (это 57,2 % на начало 2024/25 учебного года) показал, что потребности организаций в услугах связи обеспечены не в полном объеме, говорится в сообщении ведомства.\n44,6 % опрошенных (11,362 тыс. учебных учреждений) считают скорость передачи данных в интернет недостаточной для нормальной работы, а 2,2 % (558 учебных учреждений) отметили, что на предоставленной скорости невозможно полноценно использовать интернет, сказал аудитор Счетной палаты Данил Шилков.\nВ Минцифры направлено требование принять меры по устранению выявленных нарушений и повышению эффективности предоставления услуг связи образовательным организациям.\nВыявленные нарушения\nПроверкой установлено, что, например, в 26 из 52 учебных заведений Рязанской и Псковской областей пропускная способность каналов связи оказалась ниже, чем предусмотрено в госконтракте. Отдельная проблема — контентная фильтрация, которая предусмотрена в контрактах. В ряде случаев она блокировала в том числе и нужные ресурсы — библиотеки языков программирования, обновление для интерактивных панелей учебных классов, видеохостинги и пр.\nКирилл Булгаков, «Т1»: Российский ИТ-аутсорсинг берет курс на суверенитет и инновации\nТехнологии идей\nПри подключении школ к интернету не учитывается количество одновременно работающих в сети устройств.\n«Замеры, проведенные Счетной палатой в ходе проверки, показали, что на скорости 100 Мбит/с максимальное количество компьютеров, на которых возможна одновременная загрузка и качественное (без задержек) воспроизведение видео- и аудиоматериалов, рекомендованных Минпросвещения, не превышает 40 штук. При этом, по данным опроса, 46,6 % образовательных организаций имеют более 40 компьютеров (31,2 % — от 41 до 100 устройств, 15,4 % – от 101 до тысячи)», — отметил Шилков.\nНе были учтены и другие потребности, например, в видеонаблюдении, видео-конференц-связи, организации защищенного взаимодействия с Федеральным казначейством, из-за чего школам приходилось заключать отдельные договоры с другими операторами связи.\nПроблемы с подключением усугубляются, как показала проверка, наличием устаревшей информационная инфраструктура, нехваткой ИТ-специалистов с навыками сетевого администрирования.\nНа что потрачены деньги\nВ 2024 г. Минцифры заключило четыре контракта на предоставление услуг связи для школ и избиркомов по всей территории России, кроме Москвы и Санкт-Петербурга, на общую сумму 7,5 млрд руб. Единственным исполнителем является ПАО «Ростелеком».\nСчетная палата нашла нарушения при расходовании этих средств — в ряде случаев услуги связи были оказаны школам, которые либо ими не пользовались, либо вообще не осуществляли образовательную деятельность. Зафиксированы также случаи оплаты услуг ПАО «Ростелеком» до заключения договоров с локальными операторами на аренду каналов связи.\nРасходование бюджетных средств на цифровизацию\nК схожим выводам пришли аудиторы и по результатам предыдущей проверки, которая проводилась осенью 2024 г. — скорость доступа к интернету недостаточная, не предусмотрена возможность получения резервного канала связи при проведении единого государственного экзамена, неадекватная фильтрация контента.\nВ начале июня 2025 г. CNews также писал, что Счетная палата выявила недостатки в процессе цифровизации Минюста. Потратив больше 90% из выделенных трех млрд руб., министерство осталось очень далеко от выполнения заявленных целей программы.",

    "title": "员工退还红包才能辞职？无理！|辞职_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "近日，市民张女士致电晚报社区记者反映，她和几位老乡在一家工厂打工，年初工厂给每人发了一个200元的红包，因种种原因现在打算辞职，但主管却要求他们退还红包才能办理手续，工厂这种做法是否合理？\n事件回放\n张女士说，去年她和几位老乡经人介绍到一家工厂打工，工厂还将第一个月的工资作为押金扣发。今年年初，工厂负责人以奖励为由给每位员工发了一个200元的红包。因为长期无法适应工作环境和食堂饭菜等原因，前段时间她和几位老乡商量后决定辞职，向部门主管提出申请后对方要求大家退还200元的红包才能办理手续，否则只能自行离开，不予结算工资，大家觉得这种做法很不合理，双方僵持不下，至今都没有拿到工资。\n双方说法\n张女士认为，工厂发红包是对以往工作的奖励，大家拿得理所应当，况且辞职是员工的权利，他们并没有在工作中出现问题，工厂理应支付应得的工资。\n部门主管认为，当初工厂发红包是为了鼓励大家今后努力工作，如今张女士等人刚拿到红包不久就提出辞职，之后就不再是这个岗位的员工，理应将红包退还回来，如果不退还就无法办理手续结算薪酬。\n律师说法\n青海诚嘉律师事务所张律师认为：根据《中华人民共和国劳动合同法》规定，用人单位招用劳动者，不得要求劳动者提供担保或者以其他名义向劳动者收取财物。本案中，工厂将第一个月工资作为押金扣发的行为，属于违法行为。张女士有权要求工厂立即返还被扣发的工资。工厂在年初为了鼓励员工而发放的200元，在发放时未明确约定与后续工作期限挂钩，因此红包应属于福利或奖励，工厂无权要求员工退还。根据相关法律规定，劳动者提前30天书面通知用人单位，可以解除劳动合同。张女士依法提出辞职，工厂不得以任何理由阻挠，且工厂以“不退还红包则视为个人原因导致无法办理手续结算工资”为由威胁员工，属于是以胁迫手段迫使劳动者接受不合理条件，张女士可单方解除合同并要求经济补偿。记者 毓洛",

    "title": "Scott Stansberry leaving lasting impact on Mesa basketball program",
    "text": "In his 10th season of coaching, head coach Scott Stansberry Jr. continues to grow his legacy within the purple and gold walls of Mesa boys’ basketball.\nStansberry’s coaching path has seen every level of high school ball. During his first four years at Mesa, Stansberry spent time as the freshman and junior varsity head coach, before becoming an assistant coach at the varsity level.\nThat following year Stansberry saw an opportunity to be the head coach at Apache Junction, where providing uniforms and basketballs was a challenge itself. Stansberry took a program that had won 24 games in its previous eight years combined to win 30 in his three years there, including a run in Division IV state playoffs.\nBack at Mesa high school, Shane Burcar was preparing his departure from Mesa to join Northern Arizona University as an assistant coach, opening the door for Stansberry to return. While there was a coaching change entering the 2018-2019 season, for Mesa’s basketball program, the culture remained the same.\n“It’s just the culture of being together and we just roll up our sleeves, very blue collar,” said Stansberry. “We want to earn everything.”\nThe need to “earn” everything was by no means new to Stansberry who, while growing up in a military family, learned quickly how nothing in life is given. The constant change of scenery, from his time in Augusta, Georgia to El Paso, Texas–even a spell overseas– only deepened this idea.\n“I had to re-establish myself, I had to earn everything, I had to prove myself … and so I just fit in here [Mesa] ever since I got here with that type of culture, that is how I grew up,” said Stansberry.\nFamily life for Stansberry sang a similar tune. His father, Scott, taught him hard working principles whether in the house– or on the court.\n“He was definitely really hard on me, not easy at all,” said Stansberry. “He separated being a father and coach pretty good … being around that definitely had a big impact and lasting impression.”\nAnother figure in his life Stansberry pulls influence from is the late-great Don Haskins. Haskins, also known as “The Bear,” was the head coach at the University of El Paso Texas for nearly four decades and was a household name for many within the city. Now honored after Haskins himself, father-son visits to Memorial Stadium were a regular occurrence for Stansberry, where he witnessed firsthand one of the most intelligent defensive minds of basketball.\n“He was somebody that I looked up to and to be honest, I have a lot of principles that I put into our defense that he actually instilled in his team,” said Stansberry.\nThe childhood mixture of a demanding work ethic combined with the defensive mind of Haskins produces the gritty, determined and well-oiled program that is Mesa basketball.\n“We always have a saying at Mesa that ‘tradition never graduates’ … Mesa is a very hard-bought team … we’re tough in tough situations,” said senior captain AJ Seumanu.\nThough Stansberry admits the inert competitiveness that fuels one’s initial desire to coach, the impact off the court and the privilege of representing Mesa is what drives Stansberry throughout the season.\n“I don’t take it for granted, people may not realize that but every single game, I put … on the ‘M’, it means so much to me,” said Stansberry. “Quite frankly, it's my dream job.”\nHis players couldn’t agree more and are quick to not only embody the Mesa culture but also their head coach. “Self-made” and “hardworking” are the first adjectives players use to describe their head coach.\n“He doesn’t just let you take it, you have to earn it, the keys, and the rights to do what you want,” said senior captain Conway Cummard.\nSince his return to Mesa, Stansberry has coached the Jackrabbits to three 20-plus win seasons and multiple visits to the 6A state tournament playoffs, including the newly created Open Division.\nThough a first-round loss bumped Mesa out of Open Division contention, much remains on the line as the Jackrabbits reset for a run in the 6A tournament bracket.\n“It’s not like we’ve been perfect, and if you look back on our season, we’ve responded well to our losses … so I don’t expect anything different from this team,” said Stansberry.",
