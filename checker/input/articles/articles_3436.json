    "title": "Let the Record Show: California’s First Blind Woman Attorney Fought for Inclusion",
    "text": "Christine la Barraque (third from right, bottom row) defied expectations to become California’s first blind woman attorney after graduating from UC Law San Francisco in 1899. Pictured here with classmates and professors in 1897, la Barraque was accompanied by her reader (to her left), who assisted her by reading aloud. The historic photo was acquired from an auction house with funds provided by alumni and donated to the San Francisco History Center, San Francisco Public Library.\nLong before the U.S. passed anti-discrimination laws for people with disabilities, a blind trailblazer who graduated from UC Law San Francisco refused to let society define what she could accomplish.\nChristine la Barraque made history in 1899, becoming the first blind woman licensed to practice law in California, the same year she graduated from what was then UC Hastings. But her story doesn’t stop there—la Barraque was also a celebrated singer, tireless advocate, and compassionate volunteer who left a profound mark on her community.\nBorn in France, la Barraque moved to the United States at age 12 after losing her sight to an illness as a toddler. She earned a linguistics degree from the University of California in 1896, becoming the first blind woman to graduate from the institution, which at the time had only one campus in Berkeley.\n“Nobody thought I could get through the university,” she recalled in a 1906 interview with the Indianapolis News. With the support of readers—individuals who assisted by reading aloud—she overcame the odds. She was inspired to pursue law despite being told it was “absurd” by professors. She worked as a night school teacher to fund her education and graduated near the top of her law class, according to a 1907 article in Century Path magazine.\nThough she struggled to establish a career as a blind attorney, la Barraque never allowed setbacks to define her. Relocating to Boston, she followed another passion—music. After studying at the Boston Conservatory of Music, she began performing songs as “the Lady with the Green Veil,” captivating audiences across the country. Many listeners were unaware she was blind, a detail often mentioned in her obituaries.\nLa Barraque also used her voice to drive social change. In Boston, she testified before the Massachusetts State Legislature in favor of creating a commission to support employment and social services for blind individuals. Her advocacy helped establish the commission in 1906.\nLater, she returned to San Francisco, where she became a sought-after voice teacher and a fierce advocate for disability rights. Known as “the blind soprano,” she performed widely with her students, frequently earning mentions in the San Francisco Chronicle in the 1910s and 1920s. Her activism extended to public speaking engagements, where she urged employers to recognize the potential of blind workers.\nIn 1927, la Barraque became president of Workers for the Blind, a free employment agency that secured jobs for 375 blind individuals. Among the positions filled were piano tuner, janitor, dictation machine operator, insurance expert, and news reporter.\nDuring both world wars, la Barraque also supported veterans, assisting soldiers who lost their sight or mobility in rebuilding their lives. The UC Law SF Alumni Bulletin from 1961 highlights her leadership in re-educating injured soldiers.\nFor 45 years, la Barraque resided at the Beverly Plaza Hotel at Grant Avenue and Bush Street, now the site of San Francisco’s iconic Dragon Gate in Chinatown. She was in her 90s when she passed away Feb. 10, 1961.\nLa Barraque is still remembered for breaking barriers as the first blind woman licensed to practice law in California and as a strong advocate for people with disabilities.\nLet the Record Show is an occasional series that showcases people, moments, and milestones from UC Law San Francisco’s past.",

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Somerset County Gazette",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.

    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s social media post on the “natural duties” of Vaishyas and Shudras has triggered a massive row. Sarma later issued an apology on Thursday saying that one of his teammates had posted the verse from the Bhagwat Gita with an “incorrect translation”.In a post on X, the CM wrote, “As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.”“If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.Sarma on Thursday had posted a verse from the Bhagwat Gita which translated to “Bhagwan Shri Krishna himself describes the natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”.He posted the video citing the 44th verse from the “Sanyas Jog” in the 18th chapter of Gita. The video explained that while agriculture, cow rearing and business are the “natural duties” of the Vaishyas, the “natural duty” of the Shudras, is to “serve” the three varnas – Brahmins, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas.Following the post, the Communist Party of India -Marxist (CPI-M) shared a screenshot of the BJP leader’s post and wrote, “We strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas’ tweet claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. BJP’s Manuvadi ideology in full play!”All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi too launched a sharp attack on Sarma’s post reminding him that he held a constitutional post.“In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras,” Owaisi said.“Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It’s reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam’s Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,” he added.",
