    "text": "Ava Colley’s football journey began with watching games on television and playing the sport on the weekends with her dad.\nThat quality time with her father, David, was always fun for Ava, and she enjoyed football so much that she decided to take it to the next level and play competitively growing up.\nFootball has always been male-dominated, and Colley wanted to prove otherwise.\n“Eventually, it just led to me wanting to prove that girls can play a sport,” Colley said. “Even if it isn’t meant for them.”\nColley started her football career in recreational leagues, but when she reached eighth grade, she was told eighth graders weren’t allowed to play at the rec level.\nColley had only one option — high school football.\n“I was like, ‘Well, I’m not going to give up my dream of playing football,’” Colley said. “So, I came up to the high school level, played [junior varsity], and I loved it — so I continued to play.”\nSure enough, through hard work and dedication to the sport that she loves, Colley, now a sophomore, has earned herself a spot as the long snapper on the Harrisonburg varsity football squad — the first girl football player for the Blue Streaks in program history.\n“When you can be the first to do anything, as long as it’s something good, it’s gotta be important,” HHS head coach Kyle Gillenwater said. “I know she put all the hours in and the sweat and everything to do it. She deserves an opportunity, and she’ll get one.”\nColley isn’t phased by being the only girl on a team.\nShe embraces it.\n“At this point, it’s just second nature,” Colley said. “I’ve done it my whole life since I could play tackle football. It’s just something that I love to do. I love my teammates. They accept me for it, and they help me whenever I need it.”\nOf course, it’s somewhat of a different dynamic among her teammates when talking to her compared to each other. Still, the camaraderie is there as Colley feels she’s treated no differently than any other player.\n“They still help me,” Colley said. “We still have good laughs and all that. It’s just something fun that we get to do, and it’s just a different experience for them. I think they enjoy having a different perspective of football.”\nBeing a long snapper is something Colley made herself into, Gillenwater said, adding that when she started this venture, she hadn’t been in the weight room much and wanted to take on a skill where it didn’t matter as much.\nEver since taking the position, Colley has thrived.\n“She snapped every day for about a year and a half, and she’s gotten pretty good at it,” Gillenwater said. “It was a skill she worked really hard to attain, and that’s how all that came to be.”\nGillenwater has welcomed Colley to the program with open arms.\nFrom day one, Colley said Gillenwater has been widely accessible, helping her with anything she needs and giving her a chance to showcase her talent.\n“He’s been really helpful this year,” Colley said. “He’s helped me take on more positions and given me the opportunities that he would the rest of the team, so that’s been nice. He’s given me the chance to go in the weight room during the offseason workouts so I can keep up with everyone else.”\nA former captain on the junior varsity team, Gillenwater said that’s translated to the varsity level as Colley is a leader and sets a quality example of how a player should conduct themselves.\n“She’s at everything we have — first one there, last one to leave,” Gillenwater said. “Effort is always there. She’s the ultimate teammate.”\nYou can’t replace people who don’t miss anything, Gillenwater said.\nThat’s the case with Colley, as Gillenwater said she’s well aware of everything going on with the HHS offense and could answer any question about it.\nAt times, Colley’s knowledge of the game has morphed her into an extension of the Streaks coaching staff.\n“She’s an additional coach on the field,” Gillenwater said. “There’s not much about what we do offensively that she doesn’t know. She studied that just like how she’s made herself a good player and a good long snapper.”\nThere’s no doubt Colley’s passion for football runs deep, and Gillenwater has seen it firsthand.\nIt’s evident to the dual-sport head coach how badly Colley wants to be a part of the Streaks program, and she’s rightfully earned the opportunity.\n“From the first time that I’ve met her, she’s had a goal to do this,” Gillenwater said. “She worked extremely hard to get there. When you get a player like that, you’ve got to love having them on the team and be a part of the program.”\nColley is a proven example of how you can be anything you want if you put your mind to it.\nSince those first days of seeing football on TV with her dad, Colley has put her mind towards football, and it’s paid off as she now takes the field alongside her Blue Streak teammates.\nNow, Colley hopes her story will help pave the way for more girls to get opportunities in the sport, adding that if they saw what she did, they could have it in their minds that they can do it, too.\n“That’s my ultimate goal of high school,” Colley said. “At least get some girls to believe in themselves that they can eventually end up coming up here and doing the same thing as me.”",

    "text": "Warm shelter set up in Theodore to shield people without housing from this week’s bitter weather It’s more than just a place to sleep. Meals, clothing, shoes and even healthcare will be on standby. MOBILE, Ala. ( [WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/))- As temperatures drop dangerously low across the country, Eric Overstreet and John Kozlinski are ensuring people in the Mobile area have a warm place to stay. Both Overstreet and Kozlinski help folks who are displaced in the Mobile area. “This is a situation where they would maybe die on the street,” said Overstreet. “Last year, we opened five different shelters in churches and then we had the shelter downtown, the Samaritan’s home. This year, we decided to bring everybody to one place. The amazing Joey McCollough allowed us to use this gym.” The operation came together in just a few days, thanks to hundreds of volunteers who converted the gym at Theodore Church of God into a life-saving shelter. It’s more than just a place to sleep. Meals, desserts, clothing, shoes and even healthcare will be on standby. “This is an environment where they’re just going to be loved. We’re going to have three awesome meals a day, hot breakfast, lunch and dinner, amazing amounts of goodies and snacks and we’re going to treat them like family,” said Kozlinski. Just two days ago, they lost their friend, James, to hypothermia. James stayed at their warm shelter last year. “James was amazing, a brilliant guy. He had a master’s--- he was a sharp guy, we loved on him. He was an alcoholic, he just happened to be outside a couple nights ago when he got hypothermia and died in front of the Starbucks at Midtown,” said Overstreet. With his tragic death fresh on their minds, Overstreet and Kozlinski understand safety in the bitter cold is paramount. “We want to treat every human being like they’re created in God’s image, so everybody is the same to us,” said Overstreet. It was a touching scene Saturday afternoon. A steady stream of vehicles dropped off coats, blankets and shoes. “I’m just amazed- blown away by the fact that so many people are showing up to be a part of this. Anybody that wants to come by and serve-- if they’ll just stop by and talk to one of the team leaders here, they’ll get ‘em hooked up,” said Joey McCollough, Pastor at Theodore Church of God. We asked volunteers why they chose to step up to help. “No matter what they’ve been through, they don’t deserve to be out on the streets when it’s this cold,” said one. “It’s unreal. I can’t describe what it means- we did it last year. We had a lot of donations but nothing like this,” added another. “It’s very encouraging for me and my faith. And not only that-- but in humanity. To see humanity come together to help other people who are not in the best place they could be- to me, homeless people a lot of the times are just in transition,” said Ronald Stafford with Revive Ministries.

    "title": "Salvini sfida i sindacati: \\u201cGi\\u00e0 15 scioperi proclamati a dicembre, pronto a intervenire\\u201d",
    "text": "Matteo Salvini sfida i sindacati. Nel day after dello sciopero generale , il ministro delle Infrastrutture rivendica di aver firmato la precettazione: “Sono soddisfatto di aver garantito, ieri, il diritto a viaggiare con i mezzi pubblici a milioni di italiani”. Poi il leader della Lega provoca le parti sociali: “Il mio impegno non cambia in vista di dicembre, quando si contano già 15 scioperi proclamati , fra cui uno generale fissato il 13 (guarda caso un altro venerdì) a pochi giorni dal Natale . Sono pronto a intervenire ancora, per aiutare i cittadini”, dice il vice della presidente del consiglio Giorgia Meloni .\nDunque Salvini annuncia nuove precettazioni , dopo quella che ieri ha ridotto lo stop del settore trasporti a sole 4 ore: le linee di bus e metro sono rimaste chiuse nella fascia tra le 9 e le 13 in alcune fermate. La precettazione è stata aspramente criticata dai leader di Cgil e Uil , Maurizio Landini e Pierpaolo Bombardieri . “C’è una svolta autoritaria, contro la quale più di 500mila persone in tutta Italia hanno scelto di essere in piazza”, ha detto il primo, accusato dal governo di istigare alla rivolta sociale. “Noi vogliamo rivoltare come un guanto questo Paese “, ha detto Landini spiegando che la rivolta sociale significa “non voltarsi dall’altra parte di fronte alle ingiustizie, ma mettersi insieme” per cambiare la situazione.\nLeggi Anche Sciopero, Tar respinge il ricorso dei sindacati contro la precettazione di Salvini nei trasporti. Ma l’annuncio del ministero diventa un caso Oggi il leader della Cgil ritorna sulle suo parole. “Quando sono stato a Palazzo Chigi per la legge di bilancio ho regalato alla presidente del Consiglio L’uomo in rivolta di Albert Camus. Il senso di quel libro che fece grande rumore è rimettere al centro la libertà delle persone . Se la persona non si rivolta di fronte alle ingiustizie non esiste come persona, perché viene cancellato . Io l’ho pensata così”, ha spiegato al congresso nazionale delle Acli. “Oggi la messa in discussione della democrazia non la danno le persone in piazza per i propri diritti ma chi in Parlamento sta tentando di far passare un decreto che chiama sicurezza ma riduce le libertà e gli spazi delle persone”. E ancora, ha aggiunto: “Vedo il rischio che di fronte” alle “diseguaglianze, anziché reagire, uno si rassegni che prevalga la paura , che prevalga la chiusura di ognuno pensando che da soli se lo deve risolvere. Ecco, io penso che proprio perché questa è la situazione, e proprio perché dall’altra parte oggi abbiamo un governo che sta agendo dal mio punto di vista proprio per mettere in discussione le organizzazioni sociali di rappresentanza , perché non vuole governare riconoscendo un ruolo di mediazione sociale ai vari soggetti di rappresentanza, ma pensa di poter comandare senza bisogno di dover mediare come dovrebbe fare qualsiasi governo anche con i soggetti sociali che hanno una rappresentanza, penso che di fronte a tutto questo ci sia bisogno che le persone di fronte alle ingiustizie , di fronte a quello che sta succedendo non si voltino da un’altra parte, ma che ognuno si rivolti di fronte a questa ingiustizia, si metta insieme agli altri anche con solidarietà per cambiare sostanzialmente questa situazione”. E a proposito dello sciopero di ieri, ha commentato: “Quello che arrivava dalle piazze era la volontà delle persone di esserci e di partecipare. Da quelle piazze arriva una domanda trasversale di partecipazione e di rappresentanza perché il livello di sfruttamento e di impoverimento sociale non è più accettabile e la gente vuole reagire. E’ importantissimo offrire un terreno di iniziativa che sia in grado di cogliere questo”.\nHai già letto 5 articoli Acquista l'accesso illimitato a Ilfattoquotidiano.it SOSTIENICI ORA Abbonamento SOSTENITORE 1 EURO IL PRIMO MESE e poi 5,99€ al mese Leggi tutti gli articoli del sito senza limiti Partecipare in diretta ogni giovedì alle 16.00 alla riunione di redazione de ilfattoquotidiano.it e proporre la tua inchiesta Partecipare al Forum di discussione con la redazione e il Direttore e lanciare la tua campagna su un tema o una battaglia di interesse pubblico.
