    "title": "Mom born on Leap Day welcomes baby on Leap Day - Good Morning America",
    "text": "A North Carolina mother who was born on Leap Day 40 years ago welcomed a baby girl Thursday, which also happens to be Leap Day.\nDr. Kai Sun, an assistant professor of medicine and a rheumatologist at Duke Health, and her husband, Michael Paik, welcomed their third child, a daughter they named Chloe at 5:12 a.m. on Feb. 29.\nBaby Chloe made her big debut three days after her Feb. 26 due date and weighed in at 6 pounds and 13 ounces, Sun said.\n\\\"My husband and I were just saying how cool it would be if she were born on the same day as my birthday. And somehow, it happened,\\\" Sun told \\\"Good Morning America\\\" Thursday morning from her hospital bed at Duke University Hospital, where she also works.\nSun said she and her daughter are now both \\\"doing well.\\\"\n\\\"She was breathing fast initially when she was born so they took her to the nursery for a little bit to see the pediatrician but everything checked out and she's peacefully sleeping,\\\" Sun said.\nChloe's Leap Day arrival is a notable one, not just because of her birth date but also because she is a rainbow baby for Sun and Paik.\n\\\"We had a miscarriage almost exactly a year ago and so that makes her more special,\\\" Sun said.\n\\\"There were some little things along the way,\\\" the doctor added of her pregnancy. \\\"There was some abnormal finding on the initial ultrasound that we were nervous about. And then I had COVID. And I fell on my belly in [my] third trimester. There are just some small things that happened that made us a little nervous but everything turned out well at the end.\\\"\nSun said she had a message for her newborn.\n\\\"I just hope that she knows that she's special, not just because she has a special birthday,\\\" the mom of three said.\nFor her birthday this year, Sun said she plans on resting but she hopes to be discharged Friday along with Chloe. She said she is also looking forward to introducing Chloe to her older siblings, Charis, 5, and Caleb, 3, and celebrating more in the days to come.\n\\\"I look forward to taking her home with me and have her meet the rest of the family, my parents and her siblings,\\\" Sun said. \\\"And we'll have cake, of course.\\\"",

    "text": "Management of Aims Media Company Limited has called for more support and patronage, as Pathway to Jannah, one of their flagship television programmes, turns 10 years in the broadcast industry.\nPathway to Jannah is a seasonal television programme tailor-made for the holy month of Ramadan and broadcast on different stations in Nigeria.\nIt was floated by Hajiah Aminah Muhammad, a veteran broadcaster with 40 years of experience in media practice.\nMuhammad, until her retirement, worked with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), where she made her marks as one of the fantastic broadcasters in the station.\nPathway to Jannah is an offshoot of Aims Media, which Muhammad oversees as the Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer.\n“Over the years the company has partnered with individuals and groups on Pathway to Jannah. Corporate bodies find the programme a worthwhile platform to sell their brands and reach out to their target audience for the thirty-day broadcast period,” the MD/CEO said.\nThe Ramadan TV programme features various local content to serve the diverse audience, including Quran recitation to align with the main essence of the season.\n“We also run other contents on halal, ethical finance, tips on hajj and the new entrant ‘The Seerah of the Prophets’, where children are given halal media contents against the immoral contents our children are exposed to in other mediums.\n“The icing on the bouquet is the participatory quiz and empowerment segment where viewers are selected to win from the prizes provided and others are empowered from the gifts donated from individuals and corporate bodies,” Hajiah Muhammad explained.\nAims Media has continued to grow since it was established, revolutionising the broadcast industry with dynamic and quality contents that have high considerations for ethics.\n“All our contents are not necessarily religious, but we place a high premium on ethics. We have as part of our flagship programme The Magnate, which parades professionals from diverse backgrounds. Also from our stable are the award-winning Oro Yi Kan, Beyond the Frontiers and many more interactive programmes.”\nWhile appreciating their fan base for the support they have enjoyed so far, Hajiah Aminah Muhammad appealed for more patronage by individuals and corporate organisations to continuously enhance their practice of developmental broadcasting in the country.",

    "text": "Lorenzo Bertelli, heir to the Italian luxury brand, discusses Prada’s involvement in NASA’s lunar mission. Prada has entered the space race with its latest project: designing space suits for NASA ‘s Artemis III mission.\nThe white extravehicular mobility suit, while not particularly stylish, is a marvel of engineering. It weighs over 200 kilograms and features a gender neutral design with gray padding on the knees and elbows.\nBertelli, a former race car driver, sees space as the next frontier. He points to Prada’s investment of £1 billion ($1.27 billion) over 20 years in research and engineering for their competitive sailing team, Luna Rossa, and the crew’s Linea Rossa clothing line.\nThe collaboration between Prada and Axiom Space, a company aiming to build the first commercial space station, is uncharted territory. This partnership marks a bold new step for fashion houses.\nThis venture takes the group’s experimental nature to new heights, even as Miuccia Prada’s latest collection features futuristic elements.\nFashion Frontier: Prada’s Role in Shaping Future Space Travel Gear. (Photo Internet reproduction) Bertelli believes that the research and technical expertise gained through their work on the Artemis III mission will give Prada a competitive edge when commercial space travel becomes more accessible.\nHe anticipates a significant drop in prices as the industry scales up, creating new opportunities.\nMatt Ondler, President of Axiom Space , adds that the partnership has created a new model for cross-industry collaboration, expanding possibilities in commercial space.\nInnovation in Space Exploration The space suit’s red stripes resemble the Linea Rossa logo of the sailors and have been a constant presence in NASA space suits since Apollo 13.\nPrada’s expertise in high-performance materials contributed to the development of the suit’s outer layer. The inner layer features thermoregulation, a built-in nutrition system, biometric monitoring, and a CO2 filtration system.\nThe boots, designed to withstand extreme temperatures, were the most challenging part of the suit to develop. Prada aims to participate in developing the inner layer of space suits, leveraging its sailboat engineering experience.\nIn addition, Bertelli expresses pride in the company’s ability to push boundaries and sees potential for future space tourism opportunities.\nAs NASA prepares to explore the Moon’s South Pole craters, astronauts will be equipped with the Axiom-Prada suits. They will be able to perform eight-hour spacewalks during their missions.\nIn short, these suits will protect them from extreme temperatures, ranging from freezing cold to several hundred degrees Celsius above zero.",

    "text": "Яд в обертке: эксперты Роскачества назвали конфеты, которые не стоит покупать к майским праздникам\nПредставьте, вы стоите у прилавка, и ваш взгляд захватывают яркие упаковки сладостей. Рука тянется к шоколадному зайцу или яйцу с блёстками. Однако, прежде чем сделать выбор, стоит разобраться, какие конфеты могут скрывать в себе опасные ингредиенты. Специалисты Роскачества предупреждают о том, что некоторые сладости могут представлять угрозу для здоровья, несмотря на привлекательный внешний вид.\nЧто нашли эксперты о конфетах?\nНедавнее исследование Роскачества охватило 22 набора конфет, включая как бюджетные варианты, так и премиум-класс. Результаты оказались тревожными и поднимают важные вопросы о качестве и безопасности сладостей, которые мы и наши дети потребляют.\nЧитайте также: В Саратове задержали преступника, который отравил шоколадные конфеты крысиным ядом\n— Консерванты-невидимки: В составе некоторых конфет обнаружены бензоат натрия (Е211) и сорбиновая кислота (Е200). Эти добавки, хотя и разрешены, могут вызывать аллергические реакции у чувствительных людей, а также приводить к раздражению желудка. Особенно это важно учитывать при выборе сладостей для детей, чья пищеварительная система еще формируется.\n— Искусственные красители: Среди протестированных образцов был выявлен краситель Е110, известный как «солнечный закат». В Европе он считается опасным для детей и может требовать предупреждения о потенциальном влиянии на их активность и поведение. Это вызывает серьезные опасения у родителей, так как многие дети подвержены влиянию искусственных добавок, что может проявляться в гиперактивности и других проблемах с поведением.\n— Пальмовое масло: Этот ингредиент, который присутствует во многих сладостях, вызывает опасения из-за своей способности накапливаться на стенках сосудов и негативно сказываться на здоровье сердечно-сосудистой системы. Использование пальмового масла в производстве конфет также связано с экологическими вопросами, такими как вырубка тропических лесов и угроза вымирающим видам.\nКак выбрать безопасные сладости и конфеты?\nПри выборе сладостей важно быть внимательным. Читайте этикетки, словно детектив, и ищите E-шки с трехзначными номерами. Если такие найдены — лучше вернуть товар обратно на полку. Чем меньше ингредиентов в составе, тем лучше: если на упаковке указаны лишь «какао, сахар, лецитин», это хороший знак.\nОбратите внимание на срок хранения. Конфеты с длительным сроком годности (6 месяцев и более) зачастую содержат консерванты. Идеальным выбором будут сладости с сроком хранения 1-2 месяца.\nТакже ищите маркировку без искусственных красителей. Если вы хотите быть уверенными в безопасности, выбирайте продукты с надписью «Без искусственных красителей» или «Organic». Хотя такие конфеты могут стоить дороже, здоровье вашего ребенка — это важный приоритет.\nЕсли магазинные конфеты вызывают сомнения, не стоит отказывать себе в удовольствии. Вы можете приготовить лакомства дома. Например, растопите горький шоколад, добавьте измельченные финики и скатайте из смеси шарики в кокосовой стружке. Такие конфеты не только безопаснее магазинных, но и удивительно вкусные!\nРанее «Пронедра» писала Есть конфеты Roshen в Крыму опасно для здоровья",
