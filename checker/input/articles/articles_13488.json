    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#6](c6#c-6) El sol tiene, entre otros, un ciclo de actividad de 11 años aproximadamente en el que pasa de una actividad minima a una máxima. Ahora estamos en actividad máxima. Aparte de eso las auroras son provocadas por una eyección de masa coronal, pero estas eyecciones (llamadas CME) han de ir dirigidas a la tierra para que aparezcan las auroras, y muchas veces no vienen en nuestra dirección o nos dan de refilón.... y hay otros datos como la polaridad de la CME que tambien influye. En resumen: aparecen por una combinación de actividad solar y suerte que haga que vengan en nuestra dirección. Las dos de este año visibles desde españa no son algo excepcional, aunque si poco frecuente.\n[#1](c1#c-1) o a Perro Sanxe, a Irene Montero, a rayos laser judios del espacio…\n[#1](c1#c-1) tranquilo ya lo achacan a la geoingieneria\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¿A qué se puede deber?. Realmente me choca que haya auroras boreales en estas latitudes, pero desconozco si es un hecho que ya se ha registrado en el pasado (en el pasado reciente, con registros rigurosos, no en escritos medievales y tal...). Si las auroras son provocadas por el sol, como tengo entendido, ¿qué ha cambiado en ciclo solar que las pueda estar provocando?.\nCuriosidad desde el desconocimiento.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No tiene porque ser solo el sol, el campo magnético de la tierra también cambia y fluctúa.\n[#1](c1#c-1) He visto suficientes películas de desastres como para saber que despues se viene el apocalipsis.\n[#7](c7#c-7) [#9](c9#c-9) [#24](c24#c-24) [#26](c26#c-26) \"Si es bien cierto que las auroras boreales en España en realidad no son improbables, lo que sí es una circunstancia que parece única es que en un mismo año hayamos disfrutado de dos espectáculos similares. \"\nParece que a lo que se refiere es que no hay precedentes de que hayan ocurrido dos veces en un mismo año... pero vete tú a saber...\n[#9](c9#c-9) a esto venía\n[#35](c35#c-35) Perdón, no entré a ver los tuits de la noticia. Hablaba por tuits que vi por la mañana al despertar. Con fotos y comentarios que hablaban de las 04:00... Pero bueno, era broma. Si sé a ciencia cierta que va a haber semejante espectáculo estoy despierto yo y hasta despierto a mi hija de cinco años para que lo vea.\n[#17](c17#c-17) mmm... no.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Antes comamos unos gambones al vapor.\nEn España lo tenemos todo para el turista. A partir del 2024 incluimos auroras boreales en el catálogo.\neso es culpa de los aviones que nos fumigan",

    "title": "Trump Visits Border as Border Czar Harris Preps for DNC Speech – PJ Media",
    "text": "One 2024 presidential candidate visited the overrun and wildly insecure southern U.S. border this week, but it’s not the presidential candidate known as the Border Czar. Cackling Kamala Harris, the failed Border Czar, gives her speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) Thursday, as she is set to be hailed the successful coup leader — ahem, 2024 presidential nominee. Meanwhile, amidst still-overwhelming numbers of illegal alien entrants at both the northern and southern borders, GOP nominee Donald Trump has headed to the scene of Kamala’s crime to survey the border crisis up close and personal. On Aug. 22, as he visited the border, Trump posted on TruthSocial, specifically critiquing Kamala, “The millions of Illegal Aliens pouring into our Country because of Comrade Harris, our ‘Border Czar,’ and her Open Border Policies, are taking the jobs of our Black and Hispanic workers and families. BIG NUMBERS AND DISPLACEMENT. NOT FAIR! VOTE FOR TRUMP AND STOP THE MADNESS!!! THE UNIONS ARE NEXT!!!” Related: Northern Border Apprehensions Surge, Border Patrol Struggling Trump is right to note that Democrat open border policies hurt minorities and poorer American workers, the very groups Democrats love to claim that they are most dedicated to helping. Indeed, as of February, the administration’s touted job “gains” were going to migrants rather than to U.S. men. With both the catastrophic Biden-Harris economy and open borders, leftist policies are most damaging to the Americans who allegedly have an ally in the Democrat Party. Nothing has changed about that since Abraham Lincoln in the mid-1800s called out how at variance Democrat propaganda and Democrat policies were with each other. Happening Now—President Trump’s motorcade arriving at the Southern Border…— Dan Scavino Jr.🇺🇸🦅 (@DanScavino) [pic.twitter.com/GS2cQUfPVV] [August 22, 2024] “Since Comrade Harris took over the border, there has been a 43% nationwide increase in violent crime and a 60% increase in rape,” Trump said. “And the FBI should be ashamed of themselves when they report numbers, because they — in order to keep the violence numbers down, they didn't report some of the worst cities in the country, like Chicago.” That is true and, as Trump likewise noted, disgraceful. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Since— AJ Huber (@Huberton) [#ComradeKamala]took over the border there has been a 43% nationwide increase in violent crime and a 60% increase in rape. In New York this June, an illegal alien released into our country by Kamala Harris approached two 13-year-old children with a… [pic.twitter.com/UlvqBpvBQG] [August 22, 2024] In New York, Trump went on, in June, “an illegal alien released into our country by Kamala approached two 13-year-old children with a machete[-like knife] in broad daylight in front of other people, forced them into the woods, tied them together by the wrist and raped them over and over again.” The former president also cited “two Kamala migrants” who “were just arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman in Coney Island. The migrants are accused of “throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but instead of being deported, he was released into our country.” That’s Kamunism at work, allowing violent criminals to invade the U.S. and terrorize Americans. Trump has made border security a key focus of his campaign. The border crisis regularly polls as among voters’ top concerns, and it's no wonder. The House Committee on Homeland Security released its fact sheet this week updated with July data and explained, “total nationwide encounters exceeded 170,000 in July, including 104,116 along the Southwest border—bringing the grand total of nationwide encounters under the Biden-Harris administration to 10.1 million, a staggering 200-percent increase from FY17-FY20 combined.” The Congressional release added, “Notably, this does not include the roughly two million known gotaways recorded by CBP since the start of FY21.” That failure can be laid directly to Harris’s charge as the White House placed her in charge of handling the border for the Biden administration. The buck stops there.",

    "text": "Hurriyat chairman and Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who was allowed to attend Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid only thrice since 2019 in September, has urged the J&K Lieutenant Governor’s administration to “relook the policy of detention and restore his religious rights” by granting access to the mosque on Fridays.\n“I believe that repression of any kind, including on religious rights, cannot bring or maintain peace. Those in-charge of decision-making should revisit this policy, considering historical precedents and adopting a long-term perspective,” Mr. Farooq said.\nHe accused the L-G administration of disallowing him to leave his residence in Srinagar’s Nigeen area on Fridays. “There is no reason provided by the authorities for the move,” Mr. Farooq told The Hindu .\n“It’s painful to stay away from the pulpit of the mosque as a religious leader. I have the religious obligation to deliver sermons and hundreds of worshippers wait for it. The move is an assault on the institution of the Mirwaiz,” he added.\nEarlier this year, Mr. Farooq was allowed to deliver his customary sermons at the Jamia Masjid, Srinagar, for three Fridays in September. It was for the first time since he was put under house arrest in 2019, when the Centre ended J&K’s special Constitutional position.\nSecurity agencies, worried about the possible fallout of the current Israel-Palestine conflict, again decided to disallow Friday prayers at the 600-year-old mosque in the old city. In the past two weeks, however, Friday prayers have been allowed but Mr. Farooq remain barred from attending or leading it.\nMr. Farooq said the authorities whimsically open or close the central Jamia Masjid to Muslims for prayers without accountability. “No one can inquire why,” he added.\nHe said these actions were telling signs of the time and situation we live in. “It also mocks the authorities’ own statements claiming things were fine in J&K and ‘I am a free man, who can go anywhere’,” Mr. Farooq said.\nMr. Farooq knocked on the doors of the J&K High Court over his house detention in September this year. However, the L-G administration has failed to file its reply in the case. The court has granted the last week of December as the deadline to the administration to file its reply in the case.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "title": "#286 Iglesias despide a Monedero y elimina su programa en Canal Red para \"reforzar su línea ideológica\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#55](c55#c-55) De hecho, canal red a dia de hoy se financia por 18 000 suscriptores de toda la esfera de habla hispana. Y los numeros que tiene en youtube son de canal pequeño a dia de hoy (300k subscriptores, y unas 70k visitas por video, mucho menos que canales pequeños unipersonales), creo que ya hace tiempo que la estrategia es tener solo a unos pocos, pero muy radicalizados.\nNo hay mas que ver a los palmeros que tiene por aqui, que son pocos pero van a 100 comentarios al dia, y no se desvian del ideario ni un milimetro, todo el dia jaleando como perros rabiosos. No hay contradiccion alguna, ya que si el lider dice A y mañana B, sus fieles diran A y B cuando toque, la coherencia no es necesaria.\nY realmente, con eso para financiarse y sacar un puñado de escaños cuando toque, les da. Y como politicamente no tienen nada sobre la mesa mas alla de buscarle un sillon a la abeja reina, no es como si necesitaran nada mas.\n[#218](c218#c-218) Creo que lo has clavado. Me parece que Canal Red es un medio de Podemos que existe para convencer a los seguidores de Podemos de que paguen para ver programas con los que convencerles de que voten a Podemos. Y éso tiene más de iglesia o secta que de medio de comunicación, además de que se amolda mejor al ego del líder.\n[#125](c125#c-125) yo tengo esta cosita con los vendemotos y nunca me terminó de encajar.\nY aún así ha estado por debajo de mis expectativas\nRecuerdo haber comentado en Menéame, por aquellos días, que era un partido con una retórica bastante agresiva, pero que tenía que moderarse para acceder a un electorado más grande.\nLa moderaron, efectivamente, pero de alguna manera se las apañaron para hacerlo de tal forma que restringieron su electorado. Lo nunca visto.\nY ya solo reservaron ese veneno para los ex amigos, aquellos que mancillaron el ego del Señor.\nEl Podemos original era, decían, transversal. Y en lugar de intentar acceder a esa gente descontenta que quiere cosas muy sencillas (educación, sanidad, ejemplaridad...) se centraron en intentar rebañarle votos al PSOE (\"progresismo e igualdad\"), desconectando de aquello que las gente pedía.\nY lo que es peor, cayendo en cada charco del camino, en cada trampa que les prepararon.\nCreo que más que construir algo se subió a lomos del 15M con bastante fortuna, y ese crédito inicial lo dilapidaron con muy poca inteligencia.\n[#78](c78#c-78) Esto ya se lo achacaban en su momento en 2014, cuando ya se les empezaba a decir en entrevistas que digamos que por parte de la percepción general se tenía claro que Podemos era bueno \"diagnosticando\" algunos de los problemas de la política, pero faltaba luego invertir en la propuesta positiva. Y Pablo en concreto (no digo en Podemos en general, que al menos antes eran más personas que él) no ha sido de los que mejor ha sabido hacer esto último.\nCriticaba que los políticos vivieran a espaldas de la \"gente\".\nPor otra parte, contesté a\n[#1](c1#c-1) señalando otro modo que tiene Monty Burns de deshacerse de la gente que le molesta.\nTe explico que Charles Montgomery Burns es un personaje ficticio de una serie de dibujos animados, para que veas la seriedad con que te tomas el contestar a comentarios.\n[#74](c74#c-74) Un caso de corrupción del PP es como si me dices que tengo que comentar cuando sale la Luna y cuando sale el Sol. Eso son cosas diarias, ya se da por hecho que el PP va por los sobres o a decir tontadas o a dar la murga con lo contrario que diga Sánchez. De ahí que el objetivo sea que no gobiernen. Pero claro, cuando tienes en el lado izquierdo a una secta que se comporta como la derecha, pues tenemos un problema, Houston.\n[#65](c65#c-65) Me ha pasado exactamente igual. Veía mucho La Base (y hace unos meses la veía siempre), me gustaba bastante El Tablero (sobre todo cuando lo dirigía Gregori, pero después también me vi unos cuantos) y hace no mucho me vi algunos de En la Frontera y me gustaron. La verdad es que hasta me jode todo esto, porque a pesar de ser consciente de que al final lo sustenta una \"iglesia\" (algo así como la Cope con los curas), esperaba que al menos la liturgia no fuera a joder también lo que estaban haciendo chulo en Canal Red.\n* Y efectivamente, los que más me han gustado de la Base solían ser de cosas de fuera de España (como Israel/Palestina y también temas de América Latina).\n[#194](c194#c-194) Iglesias habló concretamente de vivir en casas en urbanizaciones apartadas de la gente. Totalmente distinto a lo que hacían en ese entonces los de Podemos viviendo en sus barrios, cogiendo el metro, etc.\nObviamente cuando Iglesias se fue a una urbanización a vivir en un chalet acababa como esos políticos que criticaba, porque evidentemente ya no estaba en su barrio, en Vallecas, hablando con el panadero y la frutera y cogiendo el metro, paseando y hablando con la gente del barrio y gente con un poder adquisitivo de trabajador normalito con sus problemas, inmerso en la realidad de su día a día. Ahora estaba en una urbanización con gente de poder adquisitivo más alto (aunque no sea La Moraleja), en un búnker como quien dice, sin tener ninguna inmersión con la gente humilde de un barrio de trabajadores como la que podía tener antes cuando vivía en Vallecas.\nY por último, cuando dices que \"Iglesias/Montero a comprarse esa casa no fue debido a un cambio de poder adquisitivo sino su próxima paternidad y la idea de proteger a sus hijos\", qué pasa, que otros políticos no se van a casas porque quieran tener espacio y seguridad para su familia? ¿Lo hacen porque se ponen a juntar los dedos como el Sr. Burns y diciendo MUAHAHAHAHA VIVO EN UN CHALET?\ncc\n[#96](c96#c-96)\n[#204](c204#c-204) Sobre lo primero, es justo lo que digo en el primer mensaje del hilo. Obviamente se le volvió en contra porque, a priori, estaba haciendo lo mismo que criticaba. Aunque puedas vivir en la Moraleja y estar al tanto de los problemas cotidianos... Iglesias usó un tópico para criticar a los que en ese momento llamaba “la casta”. De lo que hablaba este hombre, de forma populista, era de la lucha de clases. Pero es el gran contraargumento de la derecha: si tienes mucho dinero ya no puedes ser de o defender a la clase trabajadora. Los comunistas no pueden tener dinero y eso, como si el “pecado” estuviera en tener dinero y no en la forma en el que lo has obtenido.\nSobre lo segundo estaba respondiendo a otro mensaje en el que se afirmaba que la compra de la casa fue porque ahora tenían dinero cuando, en mi opinión, creo que el motivo fue la paternidad. No hablaba de los motivos del resto de políticos que por supuesto han podido hacer lo mismo por lo mismo.\nPero, si me permites, creo que en este asunto se mira el dedo y no la luna. El punto no era donde vive uno, sino lo aislado que está ese político de la realidad social. Y para ello Iglesias hacía, en ese momento, énfasis en la idea o en el prejuicio, de la casta, que tan bien les funcionó entonces. Lo ridículo y criticable de verdad, opino, fue someterlo a “la voluntad del populus”, no la hipoteca para comprarse un chalé en Galapagar.\n[#181](c181#c-181) Es que Rivera quiso ser califa en lugar del califa, se creyó las encuestas hinchadas y la banda de palmeros que le rodeaba y se pensó que podía sustituir al PP como partido hegemónico de la derecha, por eso no quiso ser vicepresidente, el quería ser líder de la oposición. De hecho de ahí viene que una noche se acostaran siendo socialdemócratas y se levantaran por la mañana siendo liberales, fue mero tacticismo, en la izquierda estaban PSOE y Podemos, en la derecha solo el PP (VOX en ese momento era un mal chiste), pensaron que ahí podían pillar más cacho.\n[#80](c80#c-80) la semana pasada despidieron a dos de mi empresa y se nos comunicó explicando que \"estas personas se habían desvinculado del departamento\", nunca había escuchado ese giro,\n[#165](c165#c-165) Como te digo no recuerdo haberte reportado, en cualquier caso he revisado el hilo y no me extraña que te eliminaran algun comentario.\nDel meneo está claro que no te interesa hablar. Lo de la falta de autocrítica del entorno del actual Podemos es galopante\n[#233](c233#c-233) Tanto no te extraña, que tampoco te extrañaría haberme reportado ya que no hay strick por insultos directos sin el reporte del ....\nSigue así y trabajando para que solo salga a la luz lo que le venga bien a Díaz .\nAdios\n[#209](c209#c-209) Hay un error que veo repetido y es casa se la compró casi dos años antes de ser Vicepresidente no después.\n[#10](c10#c-10) y ni aún así te garantiza seguir. Si no hay lamida diaria de ojete y aplausos y vítores tras cada declaración suya, estás en el punto de mira.\n[#125](c125#c-125) lo mismo nos pasó a muchos. Yo creo que deslumbraba cuando era Errejón quien le hacia los discursos y dejó de deslumbrar el día que lo apartó. Antes se veía un poco las costuras. Ahora es todo cartón.\n[#77](c77#c-77) ya, pero igual te deberías de preocupar más de cómo muchos políticos con sueldos de 50k netos al año si heredar tienen 3 viviendas o más en propiedad y sin hipotecas. O cómo a otros con sueldos parecidos les permiten comprarse inmuebles por encima del millón de euros cuando tendrían que dedicar el 100% de ese sueldo durante los próximos 20 años a pagarlo y sin tener en cuanta los gastos asociados... Pero oye, mucho mejor sacar punta a unas declaraciones que hizo el iglesias cuando no tenía familia y le sobraba espacio en 50 metros cuadrados, muy lógico todo.\n[#127](c127#c-127) esa es tu lógica. Lo que yo digo es que una casa de pueblo en un pueblo a tomar por el culo de Madrid es lo que los que no tienen dinero se ven obligados a hacer cambiando metros por kilómetros. Es como los imbéciles que igualan la mansión-pufo del espinosa de los monteros en el centro de Madrid (y básicamente de cualquier político que se ha dedicado a hablar del chalet del Iglesias para desviar la atención sobre dónde viven ellos) con el chalet del iglesias en a tomar por el culo.\n[#214](c214#c-214) ¿entonces \"los palacios de cristal\" son más de hormigón si están alejados del centro? Puedes dar las vueltas que quieras, que ahí Iglesias patinó enormemente. Y no critico en absoluto que se comprara la casa que le saliese de los cojones con SU dinero, pero que es un acto de cinismo de primer nivel también lo digo.\n[#167](c167#c-167) me creo que una casa en un pueblo a tomar por culo de Madrid es una casa en un pueblo a tomar por culo de Madrid. Entiendo que los muertos de hambre (que en España por desgracia hay muchos, solo hay que ver qué 2 de cada 3 cobran menos del sueldo medio) crean que es la panacea. Pero es lo del dedo y el tonto, si la prensa a la vez que muestra el casoplón del iglesias hubiera enseñado las \"casitas\" del viso, pozuelo, etc. de otros políticos igual la discusión no tenía lugar porque igual alguien se preguntaba como es posible que un político con un sueldo neto de 50k pueda adquirir un inmueble de más de un millon. Y es que las comparaciones son odiosas.\n[#258](c258#c-258) ahhh que es por numeros, no es por lo que decia antes, a ver entiendo que quieras ponerle una excusa, pero que ya estoy harto de la misma excusa, que la gente de izquierda no le afeamos que se comprara un chalet, sino lo que decia antes de comprárselo para despues comprarse uno.\nEso, dejad ya la cantinela de que el se podrá comprar lo que quiera, que la critica no viene por ahí\n[#263](c263#c-263) pues que yo sepa, si PI señalaba a la luna, y en España solo tenemos una, puede ser que sea a alguna luna de jupiter?\nPorque vamos, te lo repito, nos quejamos de que decia una cosa y luego hizo lo mismo que se quejaba.\nCinismo sin mas.\n[#266](c266#c-266) te pondria los videos de las chorradas que decia PI antes de tener el chalet, y las chorradas de el era de barrio y mil mas, pero para que, para que me salgas con chorradas señala la luna, o que realmente quería decir otra cosa, pero que solo los listos lo pillan, debes ser un listo de esos, es cierto hay pocos en españa, estan todos concentrados en podemos.\n[#270](c270#c-270) la literalidad? hostia puta, la excusa mas cutre e insultante para decir que tengo principios pero los cambio cuando me interesan, bueno, ese es el nivel.\n[#275](c275#c-275) solo porque muchos se dieran por aludidos con la palabra casta y le persiguieran sin tregua por todos medios, legales e ilegales, ha hecho más que cualquier otro político (aunque fuera sin querer) otra cosa es que gente como tú no sea capaz de verlo. Y en realidad eso es lo que estaba diciendo al hilo de los inmuebles, pero como en proberbio, cuando el sabio señala la luna, el necio mira el dedo, así estáis muchos, mirando al dedo.\n[#283](c283#c-283) podemos se hundirá por lo que sea, no me importa, tampoco les he votado. Pero sí que tengo el cerebro suficiente para poder valorar de forma medio objetiva una situación. Y lo que se ha hecho con podemos y por extensión con el iglesias ha sido vergonzoso. Y eso que no quieres ver pone de manifiesto el lamentable estado de las instituciones en este país y aún así aplaudes como una morsa por tu animadversión contra podemos iglesias o vete a saber, cuando gracias a su existencia se les ha visto a muchos el plumero. Pero oye, sigue mirando al dedo...\n[#213](c213#c-213) Que sí, que no es gran cosa comparada con las de los otros, pero es cierto que el tío se jactaba de ser una persona de a pie de comprar en el Alcampo de Vallecas, y en cuanto tuvo oportunidad renegó de Vallecas y del Alcampo. Si vas a hacer eso, mejor no ir dando lecciones a otros sobre dónde vivir.\n[#220](c220#c-220) Podemos era el principal partido entre los menores de 40 años, y durante un par de meses tuvo la intención de voto más alta de todos los partidos.\nPero comparar votos no tiene sentido porque los sistemas electorales son diferentes. En Grecia hay un premio al primer partido, lo que genera un efecto \"de segunda vuelta\". Si en España hubiera ese sistema, hubiera bastado superar al PSOE para obtener un resultado similar al griego.\n[#249](c249#c-249) Entre menores de 40 los cuales votan menos que los mayores de 55, que además están proporcionalmente más situados en provincias sobrerrepresentadas.\n[#209](c209#c-209) Pocos \"tarugos\" veo por Vallecas. Algunos de esos \"tarugos\" serían dispersados en unas horas (siendo generoso) sin ganas de volver. Sin necesidad de \"orden público\" o denuncias.\nEso es lo que veo yo. Entre tu gente, no necesitas la seguridad del estado para espantar a 4 fantasmas y quitarles las ganas de volver para siempre. No conozco Madrid en ese detalle pero puedo imaginar que los rebeldes del barrio Salamanca duran poco fuera de su territorio y los de Vallecas no hacen ascos a reventar monigotes por gusto.\n[#192](c192#c-192) Si. Cualquiera en ese caso empezaría a buscar algo con más de 60m cerca de su familia, sus amistades y su barrio de toda la vida. Lo que solemos hacer todos cuando la surge la ocasión. Seguro que miraron algo de 130m y 300k por la zona pero tenia tufo y podían mirar más lejos. Ahí te quedas con carita de \"ta luego lucas\".\n[#208](c208#c-208) También puede influir que era vicepresidente y ademas un hombre odiado. Pero vaya, si dijo que se iba a quedar en Vallecas se tendría que haber quedado en aquel piso hasta morirse y punto.\nAdemas se habría ahorrado a la panda de tarugos que le estuvo acosando.\n[#172](c172#c-172) La percepción que yo tengo es que en general la gente más inclinada a izquierda se fue a podemos mientras que la que lo estaba a derecha tiraba a Cs, pero puede tengas buena parte de razón.\nAunque los números en bruto parecen apuntar a lo que yo digo, es cierto que en sus inicios el discurso de podemos renegaba de izquierdas y derechas y podría haber atraído otro tipo de votantes haciendo que los trasvase de votos fuesen más complejos.\n[#245](c245#c-245) ¿defender? No hijo no, no tengo nada que ver con él. Pero si pretendes no querer entender lo que estaba diciendo es tu problema, pero haces el problema de todos cuando el problema real es que los que le atacaron y atacan son los mismos que no han pisado un trasporte publico en su vida salvo para hacerse la foto en la inauguración y eso que viven en el puto centro.",

    "text": "¿Reformarse o morir? La oposición en México en busca de brújula Ariel Noyola Rodríguez Publicado: 27 jun 2024 21:57 GMT En medio de la pérdida del registro nacional del PRD, la oposición se debate entre adoptar una postura más conciliadora con el próximo Gobierno, o crear un nuevo partido político.\nLa entonces candidata presidencial Xóchitl Gálvez, en Ciudad de México, 19 de mayo del 2024. Luis Barron / Gettyimages.ru Después de una derrota monumental frente al oficialismo, los liderazgos de la oposición en México, en lugar de mantener la unidad, terminaron poniendo al descubierto sus grietas y, con ello, colocando en un serio predicamento su alianza.\nPor otro lado, ni siquiera serán un obstáculo para el Gobierno encabezado por Claudia Sheinbaum: el Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) y el Partido Acción Nacional (PAN) tendrán una mínima representación en el Congreso de la Unión y serán incapaces de impedir la aprobación de reformas a la Constitución a partir de la próxima legislatura.\nYa con solamente seis gubernaturas, los partidos de oposición hacen frente a uno de los momentos más críticos de su historia. De no hacer ajustes en sus estrategias y plantear cambios de fondo, corren el riesgo de ser cada vez más irrelevantes en el escenario político.\nBarajando opciones Xóchitl Gálvez, quien fue la candidata presidencial de la oposición, declaró horas después de los comicios que el presidente nacional del blanquiazul, Marko Cortés , le había \"reclamado\" con aspavientos su decisión de llamar por teléfono a Claudia Sheinbaum para felicitarla por su victoria, arguyendo que se había tratado de una \"elección de Estado\".\nLa narrativa del líder panista que pretendía poner en cuestión la elección, sin embargo, no cuajó. Y es que luego de que concluyó el cómputo distrital, la ventaja de Sheinbaum se amplió todavía más en medio de las quejas de los representantes de los partidos políticos que abanderaron la candidatura de Gálvez.\nYa con solamente seis gubernaturas, los partidos de oposición hacen frente a uno de los momentos más críticos de su historia.\nCon todo, el Frente Fuerza y Corazón por México ya ha presentado varios recursos de impugnación ante el Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación (TEPJ), alegando inequidad en la contienda, así como la intromisión ilegal del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO).\nMás allá de que estas quejas se resuelvan a su favor, la oposición se encuentra desdibujada . Y todo apunta a que su papel no será sino testimonial en la deliberación política durante por lo menos los primeros tres años de Gobierno de Claudia Sheinbaum.\nSi bien durante el segundo tramo del Gobierno del presidente López Obrador la oposición logró la derrota de varias de las reformas constitucionales propuestas por el político tabasqueño, entre ellas, la eléctrica y la judicial, a partir del 1 de septiembre el partido Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) y sus aliados contarán con la mayoría calificada en la Cámara de Diputados, esto es, con dos terceras partes de los votos.\nMientras que, en el Senado, a Morena, el Partido del Trabajo (PT) y el Partido Verde Ecologista de México (PVEM) les harán falta solo dos legisladores para aprobar reformas a la Constitución , con lo cual, Sheinbaum prácticamente tendrá el camino despejado para materializar las iniciativas que no pudieron aprobarse durante el Gobierno de AMLO.\nEn este contexto, incluso no se descarta la posibilidad de que el partido Movimiento Ciudadano contribuya a aprobar varias de las reformas. De concretarse este escenario, las iniciativas serían votadas por una aplastante mayoría.\nAsí las cosas, algunos miembros y dirigentes de la oposición han manifestado que es necesario llevar a cabo cambios de estrategia de cara al segundo Gobierno surgido de las filas de la denominada 'Cuarta Transformación'.\nHay quienes proponen desde comenzar por realizar una \"profunda reflexión\" sobre lo sucedido el pasado 2 de junio; por otro lado, hay quienes sugieren \"abrirse a la posibilidad de ya no decirle que no a todo\" lo que propone el oficialismo; otros, los menos, consideran que la mejor opción es apostar por la creación de un nuevo partido político.\nEl ocaso del PRD y fragmentación en ciernes La alianza electoral y legislativa fraguada por Claudio X. González Guajardo, hijo del empresario Claudio X. González Laporte, está en vilo luego de que, oficialmente, el Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) anunció que el partido del sol azteca no podrá mantener su registro como organización nacional.\nEl símbolo del Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD). Carlos Santiago Por su parte, tanto en el PAN como en el PRI hay voces de inconformidad que exigen la renuncia de Marko Cortés y Alejandro Moreno , los presidentes nacionales que, a decir de buena parte de la militancia, son responsables de haber llevado a estos dos partidos a una debacle sin parangón .\nA pesar de la derrota, tanto Marko Cortés como Alejandro Moreno, hasta la fecha se oponen a renunciar a sus cargos. Hacerlo en este momento, argumentan, no haría sino \"agravar la crisis\" de ambas organizaciones políticas.\nEl descontento no es menor y es que no pocas voces dentro del PRI y el PAN consideran que, construir una coalición entre organizaciones políticas con ideologías y principios tan distintos entre sí, no les hizo sino restar aún más credibilidad ante la opinión pública , con todo y que postularan como candidata a la Presidencia un perfil sin membresía partidista.\nClaudio X González Guajardo apostaba que las manifestaciones de la 'Marea Rosa' se traducirían en votos a favor de Xóchitl Gálvez, habida cuenta de que está última fue ungida como la figura principal durante la última marcha que realizaron, días antes de la veda electoral. No fue así.\nEl líder del PRI, Alejandro Moreno, habla en conferencia. A su izquierda está Marko Cortés. Jaime Nogales / Gettyimages.ru Y la victoria de Sheinbaum fue tan arrolladora que, incluso los más férreos opositores al proyecto político de López Obrador, ya buscan reacomodo e inaugurar una relación de nuevo tipo con el próximo Gobierno.\nEs el caso del padre de González Guajardo, quien en contraste con el también fundador de la organización Mexicanos contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad A.C., ha optado por asumir un tono conciliador.\nLa semana pasada, Claudio X. González Laporte, integrante del Consejo de Administración de Kimberly Clark en México, sentenció que Claudia Sheinbaum \"tiene la oportunidad de ser una muy buena presidenta\".\nEl magnate asistió a la reunión que Claudia Sheinbaum mantuvo con el Consejo Coordinador Empresarial y, aunque no fue recibido personalmente por la virtual presidenta electa, la presencia de González Laporte no fue sino una señal de su disposición al diálogo.\n¿Un nuevo partido por efecto de la 'Marea Rosa'? Otra de las opciones que se encuentran barajando algunos de los liderazgos de la oposición es el lanzamiento de un nuevo partido político.\nIncluso los más férreos opositores al proyecto político de López Obrador, ya buscan reacomodo e inaugurar una relación de nuevo tipo con el próximo Gobierno.\nY es que ante el descrédito en el que se encuentran sumidos los partidos del viejo régimen, contemplan la posibilidad de fundar una organización política que permita dar cauce a ese 'antilopezobradorismo' que ha logrado permear en algunos sectores de la sociedad.\nEste nuevo partido político, que buscaría sacar rédito de las movilizaciones en contra de las reformas formuladas por el presidente López Obrador, estaría llamado a convertirse en la principal plataforma electoral para competir con el oficialismo.\nAsí lo expuso Guadalupe Acosta Naranjo, representante del PRD ante el INE, quien ha puesto de manifiesto la urgente necesidad de, por un lado, \"renovar el sistema de partidos\" y, por otro lado, hacer a un lado la \"marca del PRIAN\".\nDe insistir en apostar por una alianza electoral entre el PRI y el PAN, según Acosta Naranjo, la oposición terminaría por cargar con una \"desventaja estratégica\" frente a Morena y sus aliados.\nDe acuerdo con el también líder de la corriente Nueva Izquierda, algunos de los intelectuales críticos del oficialismo, como el historiador Enrique Krauze y el antropólogo Roger Bartra, han manifestado la pertinencia de formar una nueva organización política.\nEl PRD pierde su registro: el (penoso) final del histórico partido de la izquierda en México Sin embargo, paradójicamente, se ha propuesto que sea el propio Jesús Zambrano , presidente nacional del PRD, quien quede al frente de la nueva organización, con lo cual, más que una agrupación constituida con perfiles distintos, todo parece indicar que lo que se busca construir, en realidad, es un refugio para los dirigentes del partido del sol azteca.\nLos presidentes nacionales del PAN y el PRI, no obstante, no han hecho eco de la propuesta formulada por los perredistas, tampoco Claudio X. González Guajardo, quien desempeñó un papel clave en la conformación de la alianza de estos tres partidos políticos.\nSi te ha gustado, ¡compártelo con tus amigos!\nLópez_Obrador México Política comentarios You use your browser with disabled JavaScript.
