Anthony Joshua\nThe World Boxing Organization (WBO) has officially ordered Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk to defend his title against Joseph Parker.\nWBO President Gustavo Oliveri gave Usyk 30 days to negotiate a fight with Parker.\nThe situation is closely monitored by former world champion Anthony Joshua. AJ and his team hope that Usyk will take the fight with Parker. In this case, Joshua plans to hold his next fight against Daniel Dubois for the IBF heavyweight title.\nLast year, Joshua was sensationally outclassed by Dubois, losing by brutal knockout in the fifth round.\nsport.ua",

We've received your submission.\nBack to Reading Published July 25, 2024, 8:12 p.m. ET Tom Brady might be retired from playing NFL football, but that does not mean his competitive juices have completely evaporated.\nBrady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion, lost a July 4 beach football game in the Hamptons before Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin’s famous white party .\nRubin told Bleacher Report’s Taylor Rooks that Brady was “very mad” that he lost the game.\n“He was mad, very mad,” Rubin said about Brady’s mindset after the loss. “I was also mad too ’cause I thought we were going to win.”\nMichael Rubin tells @TaylorRooks details on the beach football game with Tom Brady, Micah Parsons, C.J. Stroud and more before his White Party\n(via Taylor Rooks X) pic.twitter.com/UhWXT97ceA\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) July 25, 2024\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Michael Rubin (@michaelrubin)\nExplore More Tom Brady linked to SI Swimsuit model Brooks Nader in latest dating rumor Tom Brady ‘ignored’ Terrell Owens’ plea for Bucs comeback attempt after Antonio Brown walkout Jalen Brunson inspired by Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes in new deal Rubin, the sports merch company exec, opened up on some details about the game, saying he was Brady’s first pick.\n“And you were the franchise pick,” Rooks said.\n“Which was the mistake,” Rubin said in a self-deprecating reply. “That’s like when you draft somebody wrong. Tom drafting me with the first pick was a gigantic error.”\nIn the game, a 5-4 loss for Brady’s crew, which included Odell Beckham Jr. and Micah Parsons, the former Patriots and Buccaneers signal-caller threw an interception that went back the other way to Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin.\n3 Tom Brady playing football on the beach in the Hamptons.

Getty Images for REFORM Alliance The other team, which also included Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, appeared to be ready for the moment to take down a football giant.\n“What I didn’t realize for C.J. and Damar was they’re like ‘We’re playing f–king Tom Brady,'” Rubin recalled. “‘You guys are having fun, we’re coming to kill.’ … I mean Tom always wants to win in everything he does. The other team was like ‘This is our chance to actually beat Tom Brady.'”\nBrady will now be taking his talents to the broadcast booth, calling games for Fox as the No. 1 NFL team’s analyst .",

    "text": "The US has seen a sharp uptick in loneliness in recent years, so much so that last May, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy [declared loneliness and social isolation a national healthcare crisis](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html), on par with smoking, heart disease and cancer. Even before the pandemic, approximately 50% of the adults in the US were experiencing [measurable levels of loneliness](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html.) and isolation. “How’s THAT even possible?” a friend asked me as we chatted about this recently. She went on to say how she felt more connected to her friends and family than ever before. She told me that social media has allowed her to reconnect with old schoolmates she’d long forgotten existed. She knows who’s divorced or lost their hair, how many kids they have or if they own a labradoodle. She knows their political leanings and who has a good sense of humor. She regularly envies the ones who have stayed fit, own a beachfront vacation home or travel the world. She feels sad and writes her condolences with all their other friends when someone has lost a parent or a child or a job. “I am very connected to my community,” she assured me. Is she, though? This conversation reminded me of a crucial distinction Brene Brown once made. What my friend is describing is communication, not connection. Social media platforms are communication platforms. They are not connecting platforms. Brown stressed how important it is to remember this. Relationships are the only anecdote to combat loneliness, chronic instability and the uncertainty — even anxiety — many of us experience. Dr. Murthy points out a number of societal changes that have led to increased loneliness. Community activities like supper clubs, roller rinks, bowling alleys and church gatherings have declined, reducing chances for social interaction. We are more mobile. People often move away from their hometowns, away from family and old friends. More people are living alone, especially as our population ages. Technology makes it easier to connect but often replaces in-person contact with less meaningful interactions. Even the increase in self-service kiosks and checkouts at stores cuts down on small talk with strangers, [which can help with feeling connected](https://time.com/6280607/small-talk-tips-benefits/). The shift to remote work and Zoom calls means we might be seeing our colleagues less, leading to fewer opportunities for socializing. All of this adds up to a nation of isolated and lonely people. In a [podcast](https://simonsinek.com/stories/the-incredible-power-of-an-eight-minute-catch-up-with-a-friend/) conversation between Simon Sinek and Charlene Tosi, Sinek mentioned [research](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/well/phone-call-happiness-challenge.html) that found when someone is struggling or in need, all they need is eight minutes from a friend to hold space with them to make them feel better. That’s it: just eight minutes — the time it takes to cook spaghetti al-dente! Sinek said a good friend of his now uses the codeword “8 minutes” when she really needs to talk to him. And he knows to listen. What might your life or work look like if you asked for eight minutes (or paused to give it) to truly connect in a meaningful way? Might it help shift us out of the downward spiral of loneliness and isolation in our country?",

    "text": "October was the driest month in New York City since record-keeping began more than 100 years ago, according to meteorologists. And the dry spell is not forecast to end anytime soon. “It's almost 'rinse and repeat' except we're not getting rinsed off,” meteorologist Dominic Ramunni of the National Weather Service said. “We're going to see another few days of very unseasonably warm weather as we move into early next week.” Central Park has seen just barely 1.5 inches of rain since the beginning of September – a number that normally hovers around 7 or 8 inches, Ramunni said. And October was the driest part of that period, with just .01 of an inch of rain recorded in the park. But the month had one more record left to break before turning the calendar page: It was the warmest Halloween ever, according to meteorologists. Even though Friday morning might see a sprinkle or two come through, the National Weather Service has issued a [red flag warning](https://www.weather.gov/lot/firewx_definition#:~:text=A%20Fire%20Weather%20Watch%20or,watches%20and%20red%20flag%20warnings.) for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the day – due in part to blustery winds, which increase the risk that fires can start and be carried around. That means residents should use closed containers to burn anything, extinguish outdoor fires with plenty of water, and never leave fires unattended. The weather service also warns people not to throw cigarette butts or matches out of moving cars, because they can ignite on dry roadside grasses. The current warning will last until Friday evening, when winds are expected to die down, however the weather service has been issuing such warnings frequently. Temperatures will be cooler over the weekend, with a crisp 58 degrees forecasted as a high for the New York City marathon. A frontal passage next week could bring a few rain showers, but Ramunni said they won’t be enough to meaningfully change the dry conditions – which have[ stuck around so long](https://gothamist.com/news/central-parks-dry-spell-nears-century-old-record-as-october-remains-rain-free) thanks to a high-pressure system and a pattern of moisture-lacking air that’s prevented rainfall. “The drought buster is just not on the horizon at this point,” he said. While New York hasn’t seen many major fires yet, New Jersey and Connecticut have [battled hundreds of blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/nyregion/new-jersey-connecticut-wildfires-drought.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share) that have consumed hundreds of acres this fall – sharp increases from 2023. Despite the lack of rain, New York’s reservoir levels are still [not far below normal](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/reservoir-levels.page). Parts of coastal and southwest New Jersey are in [more dire water conditions](https://dep.nj.gov/drought/current-conditions/). Most of Connecticut’s reservoirs have also [not yet entered](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/departments-and-agencies/dph/dph/drinking_water/pdf/surface-water-capacity-summary-and-drought-tracking-report-10-25-2024.pdf) drought stages.",
