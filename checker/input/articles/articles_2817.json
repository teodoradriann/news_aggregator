    "text": "China News Service, Moscow, February 1 (Reporter Tian Bing) The Russian Federal Investigative Committee announced on February 1 that Russia has confirmed that the Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft was manufactured by the United States in Belgorod Oblast on January 24. \"Patriot\" anti-aircraft missile shot down. According to the official website of the Russian Investigative Committee, on January 24, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched two anti-aircraft missiles in the Liptsi area of Kharkiv Oblast and attacked an IL-76 military transport aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces. During the inspection of the crash site of the military plane, 116 pieces of shrapnel and mechanical device debris from the two missiles were found, marked with English letters and related marks, scattered 1.8 kilometers northeast and 4.8 kilometers southeast of the crash site. Russian research using a variety of detection methods showed that traces of RDX explosives containing about 10% Octogen were found in the above-mentioned fragments, which is consistent with the characteristics of foreign-made explosives. Based on the design characteristics, geometric characteristics and identification marks of the fragmented parts obtained from the scene, professional investigation and research revealed that these are the structural elements of the MIM-104A \"Patriot\" anti-aircraft missile made in the United States. According to sources, Russia has started identification work on the remains of the victims. The commission is continuing its investigation into the incident. On January 31, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at an event in the capital Moscow that Russia had confirmed that a Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft was shot down by a Patriot missile system launched from an area controlled by Ukraine. He said that he did not understand why Ukraine did this. \"It can be assumed that it was an accident, but it is a crime anyway.\" He also said that Russia would not stop exchanging captured personnel with Ukraine because of this incident. On February 1, the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) passed a document to the U.S. Congress regarding Ukraine’s use of “Patriot” missiles to attack a Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft, calling on the U.S. Congress to condemn the “criminal behavior” of the Ukrainian authorities. Give up providing support to Ukraine and help hold accountable those directly related to the attack. On January 24, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that a Russian Il-76 military transport plane carrying 65 captured Ukrainian military personnel crashed in Belgorod Oblast that day. The plane included 6 crew members and 3 A total of 74 people, including escorts, were killed. Russia characterized the incident as a \"terrorist attack.\" (over)",

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claimed on Wednesday that the Sangam’s water is not just suitable for bathing but also fit for drinking. He accused certain groups of trying to tarnish the image of the grand religious event.Responding to this, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the ruling BJP, stating that if the Sangam’s water is indeed drinkable, it should be sent to BJP leaders’ homes for cooking and bathing. His remarks have further fueled the ongoing political debate.With Mahakumbh 2025 being a major spiritual and cultural event, the cleanliness of the Sangam’s water remains a sensitive issue, now turning into a political battleground between the ruling and opposition parties.",
