    "text": "Wichita and Affiliated Tribes are transitioning toward using solar energy to power their casinos in Oklahoma. They are using a grant from the US Department of Energy to install solar panels on top of their parking garage to help run the Sugar Creek Casino and the accompanying Sugar Creek Inn and Suites. plan is to have the panels completely functional by the summer of 2025 The grant is worth almost $3.8m and the tribe will invest almost $1m of its own money. Wichita and Affiliated Tribes Treasurer Vanessa Vance explained that the plan is to have the panels completely functional by the summer of 2025. The tribe believes it could save $9m in energy costs over the system’s 25-year lifespan. The system is expected to generate enough electricity to fully run the hotel and approximately 20% of the casino. The project will create seven temporary jobs and three permanent ones. It will be the tribe’s first form of green energy, and it hopes the project will be successful so it can introduce similar changes to other operations.",

    "title": "\"My Eczema Was So Severe I Had to Leave Australia!\" - Mumslounge",
    "text": "“My Eczema Was So Severe I Had to Leave Australia!”\nWritten by Faye Haines\nI’ve suffered from chronic debilitating eczema since I was about six-months-old.\nThe Australian climate has always been an issue, and I was allergic to everything including dust mites, makeup, fragrance, fabrics, plastics, food and textiles – even peeling fruit would blister my skin.\nI was covered from head to toe in eczema – intensely itchy, my skin sore, cracked, burning, peeling, oozing and I couldn’t stop scratching, resulting in weeping open sores.\nMy clothes and bedsheets were always covered in blood, and I was vacuuming huge amounts of skin flakes off the floor. During really bad flares, I’d lose my eyebrows and shed so much skin it looked like snow.\nThere are seven different types of eczema, and I have a combination of four different types. I also have a defective skin barrier which means I can’t keep the moisture in, or irritants out. It became all-consuming for me.\nI can’t shower or swim or exercise during a bad flare and could never go to the beach or show my body off.\nI was hospitalised more than 20 times but whenever I left Australia, I found my skin improved. In my 20’s, my doctor advised me that unless I wanted to live in and out of hospital and wear head to toe wet dressings every day, I should seriously think of moving to another country that my skin could tolerate.\nI moved to the UK and initially, my skin seemed to love the wet UK climate, but it eventually started to react. I was in Prague when Covid-19 hit and had to isolate but spent most of my time there swathed in bandages. My husband did everything outside the home, looked after me, took our son out and then worked at night until the early hours.\nWe went to Greece, and little things that are no big deal for most people were miraculous for me there. My skin started to heal, and I could shower, go swimming, wear shorts, and even wash my hair standing up instead of my husband having to wash it over the sink.\nOf course, I really missed my family, and when my skin started to heal after trying MooGoo products, I wondered if I could come home. I’d also heard about Dupixent, a new ‘biologic’ treatment for severe eczema that was helping people like me.\nIt’s an injection every two weeks, but I was determined to give it a go.\nI moved home last year, started on Dupixent, and upped my routine with MooGoo products. It’s an Australian natural skincare brand and the transformation has been incredible.\nMy skin is now perfect. It’s a bloody miracle and still can’t believe it. Dupixent, teamed with the Udder Cream and Amplified Anti-Ageing Peptide has made my skin so clear and soft.\nIt’s insane the basic things I can do now; shower, walk in the park, go for a swim – they were off limits before. I’ve been at the beach all summer, jumping in the ocean, and have even started exercising. I’m falling in love with Australia all over again.\nMelody Livingstone, CEO of Gold Coast-based MooGoo, says the business has seen a huge spike of enquiries from people over the last few weeks asking how to keep their flaring skin conditions under control.\n“While data shows eczema has a strong genetic link, it is often flared by environmental factors, and the intense weather swings can cause significant discomfort,” she says.\n“Recognising this link is key to managing flare-ups effectively.”\nMelody’s Tips for Managing Skin Issues in Australia’s Crazy Climate\nRead the Ingredients Label\nIngredients matter. Look for natural, gentle, and nourishing ingredients that provide hydration without causing irritation. We formulate our moisturisers with ingredients known for their soothing and moisturising properties including Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Olive Squalane, Chamomile Extract, Allantoin, and Calendula.\nAvoid Harsh Chemicals\nUnfortunately, a lot of skincare products contain harsh ingredients which can aggravate sensitive skin and exacerbate existing skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Opt for moisturisers that are free from common irritants such as parabens, sulphates, phenoxyethanol, and petroleum jellies.\nConsider Specific Concerns\nDifferent skin concerns require different solutions. If you’re dealing with eczema or psoriasis, look for moisturisers specifically formulated to address these conditions and help relieve itching and inflammation and if you have dry skin pick a richer one.\nSensitive skin – If you prefer a lighter texture, pick skin-loving ingredients such as with Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) which can strengthen the skin barrier.\nRed inflamed skin – creams and lotions with MSM and Aloe Vera can help calm irritated skin. MSM, also known as Organic Sulphur, is a natural compound that is known for soothing skin.\nDamaged skin – creams with ceramides that can offer hydration and help repair damaged skin barriers. Ceramides are essential lipids found in healthy skin and can help provide relief and create a protective barrier to prevent skin irritation.\nAnxious or having trouble sleeping? Look for one that contains magnesium chloride to aid in relaxation and help soothe certain skin concerns.\nTan safely!\nSunscreen, wide hats, shade and lots of water are a must. If you need an added boost, fake it ‘til you make it! Some tanning agents can cause further irritation, so look for soothing natural tanning agents. Skin-friendly ingredients include DHA and erythrulose, mixed with sweet almond, olive squalane, coconut oil, Vitamin E and purified EGCG Green Tea Leaf Extract, a powerful antioxidant that helps improve the skin barrier.\nKnow Your Skin Type – and if you don’t, take the MooGoo skincare quiz.\nAbout MooGoo\nMooGoo is a range of natural and gentle products for babies and people with sensitive, easily irritated skin. MooGoo started out in CEO Craig Jones’s home, when he was searching for something to help his mother, who suffers from dermatitis and psoriasis. As the only cream that had worked for his mum was a cream used on dairy cows, he decided to come up with his own version and whipped up a natural cream in his kitchen. His Skin Milk ‘Udder Cream‘ cleared up his mother’s skin condition and he was inundated with friends and family wanting it too. MooGoo now sells an eczema and psoriasis cream every one minute and 45 seconds. The rest is history!",

Though the ride is canceled, organizers invite participants, sponsors, and volunteers to join the Packet Pickup and Radler Release Party on Saturday, Nov. 2, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Frenzy Brewing Company located at 15 South Broadway in Downtown Edmond.

However, IMD’s Director General of Meteorology, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, clarified that the intense rain seen by the city was not a cloudburst.\nBesides Delhi, several northern states saw a massive bout of rainfall and reported a number of deaths.\nIn its latest weather update, the IMD has yet again predicted extremely heavy rainfall for several states.\nExtremely heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh\nAs per the IMD, isolated extremely heavy rainfall is very likely over Madhya Maharashtra and East Madhya Pradesh today and tomorrow, and over the Konkan & Goa, West Madhya Pradesh, and the Gujarat region on August 3.\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places over Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, and the Gujarat region from August 1 to 5; Madhya Pradesh from August 1 to 4; Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh from August 1 to 3; and Saurashtra & Kutch on August 3.\nHeavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places over Marathwada on August 3 and Saurashtra & Kutch on August 4.\nHeavy rainfall in Himachal, Uttrakhand\nThere is a possibility of isolated very heavy rainfall over Uttarakhand on August 2 and 3; and East Rajasthan from August 2 to 4.\nIsolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Jammu-Kashmir and Rajasthan from August 2 to 5; Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand from August 2 to 7; Uttar Pradesh on August 2 and 3 and on August 6 and 7; and Punjab and Haryana-Chandigarh today.\nIMD’s prediction for August and September\nThe IMD on Thursday said that the country is expected to record above-normal rainfall in August and September. It added that there are good chances of favourable La Nina conditions developing by the end of August. It added that rainfall across India in August and September is expected to be approximately 106 percent of the long-term average of 422.8 mm.\nSince June 1, India has recorded 53.8 mm of rainfall against the normal of 445.8 mm.\nMohapatra said that parts of northeast India, adjoining east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra and Kutch, and pockets of central and peninsular India are expected to record below-normal rainfall in August and September.",

    "text": "Christians arrested in Mauritania for holding baptism ceremony that outraged Muslims released Officials in Mauritania have released all Christians arrested after a video of a baptism ceremony in November prompted Muslims to call for their punishment, Christian leaders in the region said. The Christians do not appear to have been charged with any crime, the Christian leaders indicated. “They have been asked to go home and believe what they want, but in private and discreetly,” a Christian leader in the region told Christian Daily International. “It seems that our brothers have more to fear from the Islamists than from their government. Thank God for this happy ending.” At least 15 and possibly as many as 18 [Christians were arrested](https://www.christiandaily.com/africa/mauritania-arrests-christians-in-response-to-muslims-outrage.html) along with their families, and the regional leader said that by Dec. 18 they had all been released. There is no law against evangelism in the northwest African country, though officials ban any public expression of faith except Islam. At least three of the Christians were initially arrested on or shortly before Nov. 30 in Selibaby, more than 600 kilometers (373 miles) south of the capital city of Nouakchott, according to Spanish news service [EFE](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/mauritania-religi%C3%B3n_arrestan-a-tres-personas-en-mauritania-por-convertirse-al-cristianismo/49021508). The arrests stemmed from protests calling for Christians to be killed after a video of a baptism ceremony appeared in social media, according to Christian leaders in the region. Only foreigners are allowed to hold non-Muslim religious services in Mauritania, and it is illegal for citizens to attend, according to the U.S. State Department’s latest International Religious Freedom Report (2022). While Mauritanians are thus prohibited from holding church services, the government does not usually prevent non-Islamic groups from holding religious gatherings in private spaces, according to the report. Though there is no law against evangelism in Mauritania, officials nevertheless forbid non-Muslims from “proselytizing,” according to the State Department report. Apostasy, or leaving Islam, is punishable by death in Mauritania, where the population is 98% Sunni Muslim, 1% Shiite Muslim and the constitution designates Islam as the sole religion of the citizenry and state. The estimated 11,000 Christians in the country of 4.9 million people make up 0.2% of the population, according to Open Doors. Mauritania’s laws and legal procedures derive from a mix of French civil law and sharia (Islamic law), but there have been calls from the public for increased application of the country’s sharia-based criminal code, according to the State Department’s 2022 religious freedom report. “The law prohibits apostasy and blasphemy,” the report states. “The criminal code mandates a death sentence for any Muslim convicted of apostasy or blasphemy, but the government has never applied capital punishment for apostasy or blasphemy.” Faith-based Non-Governmental Organizations must refrain from proselytizing or otherwise promoting any religion other than Islam. While the government typically allows private non-Islamic worship, technically the government must pre-approve all group meetings, “including non-Islamic religious gatherings and those held in private homes,” according to the report. Possession of non-Islamic religious materials remained legal, although the government continued to prohibit their printing and distribution, it adds. Although Mauritania is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides everyone the “freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief” of their choice, the government continued to ban any public expression of religion except that of Islam, according to the religious freedom report. “Authorized churches were able to conduct services within their premises but could not proselytize,” the report states. “An unofficial government requirement restricted non-Islamic worship to the few recognized Christian churches.” Mauritania ranked 20th on Open Doors 2023 World Watch List of the countries where it is most difficult to be a Christian.

    "text": "Masculina Grupo Norte A primeira xornada do 2024 no grupo norte da Galega cadete trouxo unha cita importante para a provincia. A Residencia foi anfitrión do derbi contra o Lugo e malia que os albivermellos acumulaban unha mellor xeira o partido caeu do lado do cadro da Cheda. Os locais foron superiores na primeira metade en tódalas fases do xogo ante un Lugo que non foi capaz de crear ocasións de perigo e que perdía o balón en medio campo. Nunha desas perdas chegou o primeiro gol do Residencia, no minuto 37. Na segunda metade o equipo de Rochela mellorou e conseguiu chegar á portería rival con ocasións de perigo de Javi e Dani. Aínda así, a Residencia mantívose serio en defensa e intentaron avultar o marcador ata que certificaron a vitoria co 2-0 nunha falta. RESIDENCIA 2 - 0 LUGO B CD Lugo B: Paulo, Unai, Miguel, Daniel, Raúl, Javier, Nicolás, Brais, Javier F, Hugo e Rubén. Suplentes: Carlos, Iker, Pedro, Pablo e Nicolás.

Esta xornada foi superado polo Escola DSF na casa cun marcador de 1-7. Os lucenses empezaron o partido bastante ben e a primeira metade estivo igualada. Malia isto, encaixaron dous goles castigando dous erros seus. Aínda así, no minuto 18 conseguiron marcar o 1-2 a través de Óliver e tiveron outra ocasión para empatar o encontro antes do descanso. No segundo tempo o equipo de Carlos Fontal aguantou ben os primeiros minutos, pero notáronse as baixas, algún xogador pediu o cambio e o Escola comezou a ser implacable. No minuto 51 chegou o 1-3 e dende aí lograron meter catro goles máis.

O Friol adiantara o seu encontro contra a Pastoriza e en decembro deixaron as contas saldadas cun marcador de 3-5 en contra das lucenses. No caso do Milagrosa, non empezou moi ben o ano, xa que o Silva lles gañou con goleada.

    "text": "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Kerem Shalom crossing, a key entry point into Gaza, has reopened for aid delivery after a temporary suspension. The closure, which lasted several days, was attributed to “security incidents.”\nOn Friday, 81 trucks loaded with food and medical supplies made their way into Gaza through both the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel and the Rafah crossing from Egypt. However, OCHA expressed concern that the current level of aid is significantly lower than what is needed in the region. Prior to October 7, about 455 trucks carrying commercial goods were entering Gaza daily.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing had been closed from December 25 to 28 due to security-related events, including a deadly drone strike on December 25, local communities intercepting food convoys, and unexpected transfers of prisoners and casualties from Israel disrupting operations.\nOn Friday, Tal Heinrich, a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister, explained that the UN had requested the crossing’s closure on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to conduct aid inspections amid congestion on the Gaza side. Heinrich emphasized that Israel is not restricting the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza, dismissing any claims to the contrary as inaccurate.",
