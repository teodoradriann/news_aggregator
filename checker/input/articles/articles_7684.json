    "text": "The UFC 306 broadcast team is set for the historic event at the Sphere in Las Vegas with plans to celebrate Mexican Independence Day throughout the night.\nAfter missing out on UFC 305 in Australia because he doesn’t travel to international cards, Joe Rogan returns to serve as color commentator alongside UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier . Like usual, Jon Anik handles play-by-play duties for the event.\nIn the arena, Megan Olivi handles reporting with Din Thomas serving as the sideline coach throughout the broadcast on ESPN’s networks including the ESPN+ pay-per-view.\nUFC officials confirmed the broadcast plans to MMA Fighting on Thursday.\nWhile the broadcast team is largely the same for every major pay-per-view event, this card isn’t the typical UFC show with elaborate plans for production built around the card as the Sphere.\nWith massive LED screens surrounding the circular arena, the UFC production team in coordination with ESPN plans to roll out a much different look for the pay-per-view that kicks off next Saturday night from Las Vegas.\nThe fights on the card will also feature different backgrounds throughout the show with the LED screens being utilized even when the action is taking place inside the octagon.\nUFC CEO Dana White revealed recently that the promotion has invested more than $20 million for the event, which is an unprecedented investment for a single pay-per-view. It’s likely this is the first and only card that the UFC will produce at the Sphere with the company still maintaining a relationship with MGM, who owns and operates the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\nUFC 306 is headlined by a pair of title fights as Sean O’Malley defends his bantamweight championship against Merab Dvalishvili while Alexa Grasso faces off with Valentina Shevchenko with the flyweight title on the line in the co-main event.\n🥷🥊🥋 😍 USE the BET9JA Promotion Code YOHAIG for a ₦100,000 Bonus!",

    "text": "Des nuits de plus en plus chaudes pour 30 % de la population mondialeça se réchauffe•Selon une analyse scientifique parue ce jeudi, le nombre de nuits dépassant 25°C a déjà considérablement augmenté pour environ un tiers de la population mondiale. Ce qui n’est pas sans conséquences pour la santé 20 Minutes avec AFP Le changement climatique réchauffe les températures de la planète le jour, mais aussi la nuit…. Selon une analyse menée par Climate Central, un groupe indépendant de scientifiques et de spécialistes de la communication sur le climat, le nombre de nuits dépassant 25°C a déjà considérablement augmenté pour environ un tiers de la population mondiale et ce, alors que l’Organisation mondiale de la santé ( [OMS](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/oms)) recommande de maintenir la température ambiante à 24°C ou en dessous pendant la nuit. Trinité-et-Tobago, dans les Caraïbes, a connu l’augmentation moyenne la plus importante de tous les pays, avec 47 nuits supplémentaires par an au-dessus de 25 degrés Celsius. La ville indienne de [Bombay](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/bombay) a subi deux mois supplémentaires de nuits chaudes. Des conditions qui peuvent devenir mortelles Au-dessus de 24°C, le sommeil devient inconfortable, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur la santé des personnes vulnérables (bébés, personnes âgées ou souffrant de maladies chroniques). Un danger réel confirmé par Nick Obradovich, scientifique en chef au Laureate Institute for Brain Research, basé aux [Etats-Unis](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/etats-unis/) : « les températures nocturnes plus élevées, en particulier pendant les périodes chaudes de l’année, peuvent nuire au sommeil et réduire la récupération physique à la suite de températures diurnes élevées, ce qui peut avoir des répercussions en cascade sur la santé. » Il ajoute, bien qu’il n’ait pas participé à l’étude, que le seuil de 25°C « n’est pas une valeur absolue en dessous de laquelle la santé est bonne et au-dessus de laquelle elle se détériore », mais elle entraîne des conséquences variables selon les personnes, notamment si à la chaleur s’ajoute de l’humidité, créant parfois des conditions qui peuvent devenir mortelles.",

    "text": "Department of Migrant Workers Sec. Hans Leo Cacdac in this file photo. He said on Thursday eight of 21 Filipino crew of the ill-fated MV Eternity C were rescued. Arnel Tacson/INQUIRER.net\nMANILA, Philippines — Eight of the 21 Filipino crew of the ill-fated MV Eternity C were rescued as of Thursday, after the bulk carrier was attacked by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.\nThe Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) remains hopeful that the remaining 13 still unaccounted Filipino seafarers are alive and safe with rescue operations ongoing. This was amid reports that at least three of the ship’s crew were killed and several others were abducted and currently held by the Iran-aligned Islamist group.\nArticle continues after this advertisement In a Palace press briefing, DMW Sec. Hans Cacdac said five Filipino crew of MV Eternity C were rescued after they were found in the seas by responding rescue teams.\nFEATURED STORIES GLOBALNATION Brother of Duterte adviser arrested for multiple criminal offenses GLOBALNATION Alan Cayetano pushes for Rodrigo Duterte release, house arrest GLOBALNATION Man who killed cats in Singapore has jail term doubled to 27 months READ: Marcos orders aid for PH seafarers’ kin after vessel sinks in Red Sea\nThree more Filipino seafarers were added to the survivors, he said in an interview on dzBB on Thursday afternoon.\nAlthough they spent more than 24 hours in the water, the DMW chief said they were in “good condition.”\n“None of them has serious physical injury or illness. But of course, it is safe to say that they may have some physical stress with what they went through,” he added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement According to Cacdac, the rescued Filipinos were on the way to a safe destination, which he did not disclose for security reasons.\n“The Philippine government will do all we can to provide necessary assistance to them, starting with medical, physical and mental health assistance,” he noted.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Cacdac said the DMW already started on Wednesday night their personal visits to each of the families of the Filipino crew members, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordering to provide all help to each of them.\n“We have assured them of the President’s directive to take care of them, and we will do everything so we can provide assistance to them,” he added.\nOthers still unaccounted The government already received information from the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, through the Philippine defense attache in Bahrain, that at least three Filipinos were killed but “this is still subject to confirmation.”\nMaritime security forces said Houthis attacked Eternity C with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speed boats.\nThe Liberia-flagged and Greece-operated MV Eternity C was attacked by Houthis while it was 50 nautical miles west of Hodeidah, Yemen, on July 7 to early hours of July 8 in Manila time.\nIt has 22 crew members on board — 21, including the captain, were Filipinos; and one Russian. Three armed guards were also on board, including one Greek and one Indian, who was one of those rescued.\nThe United States Mission in Yemen accused the Houthis of kidnapping many surviving crew members from MV Eternity C and called for their immediate and unconditional safe release.\nThe DMW has suspended the license of the manning agency and principal of MV Eternity C, with Cacdac saying they would also pursue civil and criminal remedies as investigation rolls.\n“We are not happy, of course, with the way things [were] done out in terms of allowing the crew to sail to a high-risk zone,” Cacdac said.\nMultiple violations Based on its initial investigation, the manning agency and the principal committed several violations, including failure to comply with the strict reportorial processes and other critical requirements prior to sailing.\n“Worse, the ship traversed the Red Sea not once but twice,” Cacdac noted.\nUnder DMW Department Order No. 1 issued in March 2024, shipowners and manning agencies are mandated to report planned passages through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and ensure Filipino crew members are fully informed of the risks involved. Filipino seafarers have the right to refuse to sail in these so-called warlike zones.\nThe ship originated from Egypt and unloaded its cargo in Berbera, Somalia. It was supposed to depart for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, but got attacked upon reaching the Red Sea west of Hodeidah, Yemen.\nREAD: In 2 Houthi attacks, 17 Filipinos safe; PH checking on 21 others\nIt was the second attack of Houthis in the same week. The Houthis also have claimed responsibility for MV Magic Seas.\nAll 17 Filipino crew from MV Magic Seas were rescued before it sank. They are set to arrive in Manila on July 11.\nMeanwhile, the DMW is eyeing to impose tighter regulations in the deployment of Filipino seafarers after the attacks of Houthi rebels against two Filipino-manned vessels in the Red Sea.\nCacdac did not directly answer if a temporary stoppage of deployment of Filipino seafarers would be recommended to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n“We are seeking the help of political and security experts, as well as the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and the DND (Department of National Defense), to analyze or tell us how the situation has changed or worsened. Of course we know that the Houthis have skips, RPGs and ballistic missiles, but we want to know the intensity and the tenor of the Houthi side with respect to these particular attacks,” he said.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
