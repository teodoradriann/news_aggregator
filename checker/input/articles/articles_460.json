America combined. He explains in 3 mins what they can’t learn in a lifetime. pic.twitter.com/mhnk51THGa\nh/t…\n— 💯 Cary Kelly 💯 (@CaryKelly11) February 5, 2024\nGrazing is regenerative agriculture, the bests single way to sequester carbon from the atmosphere into the soil, by grazing off plants and bringing the cattle in, we’re managing a solar panel, it needs to be green and growing so it can capture sunlight and pull carbon from the air and put it into its roots, but those plants will stop doing that if they get too tall, or they get too short.\nSo what farmers do with their cattle is they come in and graze those plants off, so they rest it, they prune the solar panel so it doesn’t get too tall and then they leave and it rests, and that graze rest recovery is actually a cycle of pulling carbon from the air into the plant roots, and when those plants get grazed they actually release that carbon into the soil and in turn pick up water and other minerals from the soil microbiological activity cause our soils to be living and alive instead of dead and sterilized, and year after year putting it into our soil which produces more grass, which the allows us to graze and produce more cattle\nSeventy percent of the earths’ land is land that is not suitable for tillage, which is to say, it’s not arable, and if you just say we’re not going to do any cattle grazing you’ve completely given up the ability to produce food on that acreage and you’ve lost your single best tool to actually restore that land.\nThere are groups out there that have done these same principles in the desert and transformed desert landscapes into something that looks just beautiful and lush. Cattle can be a tool to heal that and in terms of water and addressing that they do drink a lot of water, however as the graze that water then filters down through healthy soil and it actually is a system that helps increase soil life and activity by drinking that water are actually continually watering the fields and they’re not as reliant on rainwater and so that cycle actually builds health and builds ecology deep into the soil and there’s no net loss of water in that system because it is a closed system.\nEven methane, well they you know they burp and they release methane and its greenhouse gas here in the last few years they have actually discovered that if you take a field that’s been grazed and regenerated with cattle for a few years that soil has microbes in it that break down methane, they didn’t think there was a microbe that could handle methane as it turn out they do and when they measured the total amount of them it turns out that the microbes in the soil that support, say 100 cows are actually capable of breaking down the methane from way more than 100 cows.\nIt’s all about how you take care of it, they can be a tool of destruction or they can be a tool of life, it really first comes down to how you care for them, and with cows. – Carey Kelly , US\nSource: https://cairnsnews.org",

    "text": "Afrique centrale et de l’Ouest : plus de 700 000 personnes touchées par des inondations sévères\nDes pluies torrentielles en Afrique centrale et de l’Ouest ont provoqué de graves inondations affectant plus de 700 000 personnes et faisant 72 noyés et 699 blessés, selon une agence de l’ONU. Le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires a annoncé une aide d’urgence pour les pays les plus touchés.\nDes maisons submergées, des femmes et des enfants sans abri, des hectares de terres agricoles ravagés et des milliers de têtes de bétail perdues: l'ampleur de la catastrophe naturelle causée par les précipitations abondantes en Afrique centrale et de l’Ouest est considérable.\nLes inondations, deux mois après le début de la saison des pluies, ont déjà touché 700 000 personnes en République centrafricaine, au Tchad, en Côte d’Ivoire, en République démocratique du Congo, au Libéria, au Niger, au Nigéria, au Mali et au Togo.\nLe Tchad est, jusqu’à l’heure, le pays le plus touché, avec 250 000 personnes affectées par les pluies torrentielles en l'espace de quelques semaines, a fait savoir l’ONU dans son communiqué du 13 aout.\n« Chaque année, nous tirons la sonnette d’alarme sur les effets du changement climatique et sur ce que cela signifie pour la vie des gens : leurs maisons, leur capacité à cultiver et à se nourrir, à envoyer leurs enfants à l’école, à accéder aux soins de santé de base », a déclaré Charles Bernimolin, chef du Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires des Nations Unies pour l’Afrique de l’Ouest et centrale.\nCrise climatique récurrente dans la région\nChaque année, les mêmes communautés sont frappées par des inondations frappant également les moyens de subsistance et les services sociaux de base et compromettant leurs capacités à subvenir à leurs besoins, les contraignant à dépendre de l’aide extérieure pour survivre dignement.\nLa production et la sécurité alimentaires sont également menacées, avec 25 000 hectares de terres agricoles endommagés et 4 200 têtes de bétail perdues, rapporte l'ONU.\nL'accès aux soins de santé et à l'éducation de base est gravement entravé, avec de nombreuses écoles et centres médicaux détruits ou endommagés. Les infrastructures et bâtiments essentiels ont été également affectés.\nEnviron 62 000 habitations ont été détruites ou endommagées, laissant près de 55 000 personnes sans abri et déplacées. Le Nigéria et le Tchad sont les pays les plus touchés, avec respectivement 46 000 et 5 000 déplacés à cause des inondations.\nL'ONU avertit que les besoins d'une population déjà vulnérable à cause de la pauvreté chronique, du sous-développement, des conflits et de l'instabilité politique en seront plus importants, et nécessitera des ressources accrues pour la réponse humanitaire.\nPour faire face aux urgences liées aux chocs climatiques, notamment les inondations, le Fonds central d’intervention pour les urgences humanitaires a alloué 10 millions de dollars au Congo, à la RDC et au Niger.",

    "text": "Sponsored Content\nIn recent years, the struggle against obesity and weight gain has become a global health priority. Millions of individuals grapple with excess body fat, exploring various diets and exercise regimes, often with little to no success.\nThis widespread issue has prompted extensive scientific research to understand the underlying causes of obesity. Remarkably, a team of German scientists has made a groundbreaking discovery, identifying the primary culprit behind stubborn body weight and belly fat: low levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT).\nBAT plays a crucial role in regulating body heat and energy expenditure. Unlike the more common white fat, which stores calories, brown fat burns calories, contributing to weight loss and improved metabolism. This discovery sheds light on why many people struggle to lose weight despite their best efforts.\nIn response to this revelation, a dedicated team of scientists and health experts has developed\nPuravive, a revolutionary weight loss supplement. Puravive stands out as the only product in the world specifically designed to optimize BAT levels in both men and women.\nThe buzz around Puravive is growing, with numerous users reporting positive outcomes.

This unique supplement stands alone in its category, boasting a proprietary blend of eight exotic tropical nutrients and plant-based compounds. These ingredients are not only natural but also clinically validated for their efficacy in enhancing the body’s brown adipose tissue (BAT) levels—a key element in promoting weight loss.\nCrafted from 100% natural components, Puravive prides itself on its commitment to purity and safety. The formulation steers clear of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), ensuring a product that aligns with the body’s natural processes. This approach to health and wellness is further underscored by the supplement’s easy-to-swallow capsule form, designed for effortless incorporation into daily routines.\nOne of the striking features of Puravive is its accessibility. The product eliminates the need for a prescription, making it readily available to those seeking a natural path to weight management. Its plant-based origin caters to a wide range of dietary preferences and lifestyles, while its non-habit-forming nature underscores a commitment to consumer well-being.\nManufactured in an FDA-approved facility adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Puravive upholds the highest standards of quality and safety. This attention to detail extends to its formulation, which is free from unwanted side effects, reflecting the brand’s dedication to delivering a health-friendly product.\nThe customer response to Puravive has been overwhelmingly positive, echoing its effectiveness and affordability. The supplement not only comes with enticing bonuses, discounts, and offers but also embodies a promise of a healthier, more balanced life.\nTry Puravive now and experience the difference!\nThe Working Mechanism Of Puravive Weight Loss Supplement\nPuravive operates on a cutting-edge principle, harnessing the potential of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to revolutionize weight loss. This approach is grounded in recent German research, which pinpointed low BAT levels as the surprising root cause of excessive belly fat. A substantial study involving over 52,000 men and women revealed a common denominator among participants with excess body fat: diminished levels of BAT.\nBAT is not just any fat; it’s a specialized type that functions as a fat shrinker. Unlike regular fat cells, BAT burns calories continuously, enhancing the body’s metabolic rate and thermogenesis. Puravive is engineered to boost these BAT levels, tapping into their unique ability to burn calories. Remarkably, BAT can incinerate 300 times more calories than other cells in the body, as highlighted on Puravive’s official website.\nBut Puravive’s benefits extend beyond mere weight loss. The supplement’s natural ingredients are carefully selected not only to elevate BAT levels but also to foster a range of health improvements. These ingredients contribute to heightened energy levels and improved brain function.\nAdditionally, they support cardiovascular health by enhancing blood flow, stabilizing blood sugar levels, and promoting healthy cholesterol. This multifaceted approach positions Puravive as more than a weight loss aid; it’s a catalyst for overall well-being.\nIn essence, Puravive stands as a beacon of hope for those seeking a natural, effective solution to weight management challenges. By targeting the newly discovered root cause of excess body fat and offering a host of health benefits, Puravive is redefining the landscape of weight loss supplements.\nClick here to check out the official website for Puravive >>>\nClinically Proven Ingredients Use In Puravive Pills\nThe Puravive fat-burning formula was developed using 100% natural ingredients and plant extracts, which are clinically proven to support weight loss.\nAside from raising the body’s brown fat levels, these compounds also support healthy blood pressure, glucose, and energy levels.\nLet’s explore the Puravive ingredients one by one:\nWhite Korean Ginseng\nWhite Korean Ginseng, a revered component in traditional medicine, has earned its place in Puravive due to its multifaceted health benefits. Renowned for its ability to boost energy levels and strengthen the immune system, this root also plays a crucial role in weight management.\nIts properties include enhancing metabolic rate and improving the body’s ability to manage stress. Stress is often a hidden culprit in weight gain, as it can lead to hormonal imbalances and unhealthy eating habits.\nHoly Basil\nHoly Basil, also known as Tulsi, is a prized herb in both culinary and medicinal spheres, particularly in Ayurvedic practices. Its inclusion in Puravive is strategic, owing to its impressive stress-relieving properties.\nStress reduction is vital in weight loss, as high-stress levels can lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger weight gain. Holy Basil stands out for its adaptogenic traits, helping the body adapt to stress and promoting mental balance.\nAdditionally, it aids in regulating blood sugar levels, a crucial factor for weight management. This herb’s multifunctional role in enhancing mental well-being and supporting metabolic health makes it a valuable asset in Puravive’s arsenal against weight challenges.\nLuteolin\nLuteolin, a naturally occurring flavonoid found in various plants and herbs, is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These qualities are essential in weight management, as inflammation can be a significant barrier to achieving weight loss goals.\nLuteolin helps to combat oxidative stress in the body, which is often linked to obesity and metabolic issues. Its role in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress not only supports healthy weight management but also contributes to overall wellness.\nDon’t miss out on this limited-time opportunity to get Puravive!\nAmur Cork Bark\nAmur Cork Bark, derived from the Amur Cork tree, is an integral component of Puravive, chosen for its unique health benefits. This bark is known for its ability to aid in digestion and reduce bloating, which are crucial for effective weight management.\nIts properties also include enhancing gastrointestinal health, which plays a significant role in the body’s metabolism and overall weight regulation. Additionally, Amur Cork Bark has been recognized for its potential to help regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels, both of which are key factors in maintaining a healthy weight.\nBy incorporating Amur Cork Bark into its formula, Puravive takes a comprehensive approach to weight loss, addressing various aspects of digestive and metabolic health.\nPropolis\nPropolis, a compound produced by bees, is a noteworthy inclusion in Puravive’s formula. This natural substance is rich in antioxidants and has been used for centuries for its healing properties.\nIn the context of weight loss, Propolis is particularly beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial qualities. These properties contribute to a healthier gut environment, which is crucial for effective metabolism and weight management.\nAdditionally, Propolis has been shown to aid in balancing blood sugar levels, a key factor in controlling appetite and reducing cravings.\nOleuropein\nOleuropein, a compound extracted from olive leaves, is renowned for its health-boosting properties. This natural antioxidant is celebrated for its ability to improve heart health and regulate cholesterol levels, both of which are crucial for a healthy weight management regime.\nAdditionally, Oleuropein has been shown to enhance fat burning by increasing the body’s thermogenic response, a process where the body burns calories to produce heat. This effect not only aids in reducing excess body fat but also contributes to a more efficient metabolic rate.\nQuercetin\nQuercetin, a flavonoid abundantly found in fruits and vegetables, plays a pivotal role in Puravive’s formulation. Esteemed for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, Quercetin contributes significantly to weight management.\nIt aids in boosting metabolism and enhancing the body’s ability to burn fat, making it an essential ingredient for those seeking to lose weight effectively.\nMoreover, Quercetin is known to improve endurance and exercise performance, providing an additional edge for individuals engaging in physical activities as part of their weight loss journey.\nKudzu\nKudzu, a vine native to Asia, is a key ingredient in Puravive, chosen for its rich history in traditional medicine and its range of health benefits. This plant is particularly noted for its high content of isoflavones, compounds that offer antioxidant properties.\nKudzu helps in regulating metabolism and aids in controlling cravings, making it a valuable ally in weight loss efforts. Additionally, its potential to improve liver function plays a significant role in the body’s detoxification processes, which is essential for efficient metabolic activity.\nThe incorporation of Kudzu in Puravive’s formula signifies a commitment to not only aiding in weight reduction but also supporting the body’s natural cleansing processes and overall metabolic health.\nPlace your order today by clicking here before stock runs out! >>>\nWhat Do The Customers Say? – Puravive Reviews\nThe Puravive reviews speak volumes about the product’s success and customer satisfaction.
