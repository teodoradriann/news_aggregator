    "title": "Reliance will never be complacent, will be in world's top 10 conglomerates, says Ambani, ETHRWorld",
    "text": "Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance IndustriesNew Delhi, Having created businesses ranging from world's largest single-location oil refining complex to nation's largest mobile network operators in just few years, billionaire Mukesh Ambani says his group Reliance Industries Ltd will never be complacent and will grow to be among the top 10 business conglomerates of the world.Addressing employees on Reliance Family Day - the birthday of the group's founder Dhirubhai Ambani, he said Reliance is now aiming to consolidate a place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption. \\\"Today, the domestic and global environments for business are changing very fast. There is simply no room for complacency,\\\" he said. \\\"Reliance was never complacent in the past, and Reliance will never be complacent in future.\\\" Reliance, he said, is known for \\\"disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention.\\\" Starting with a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai, Reliance did backward integration -- it ventured into petrochemicals (which provide feedstock for textiles) and became the nation's largest producer. It then set up an oil refinery -- the largest in the country and expanded it to being the world's biggest single-location oil refining complex. In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world. Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services. \\\"We have shown the courage to set the bar high, and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,\\\" Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance, said. He said as India races ahead to become the world's third largest economy (from being fifth largest), an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. \\\"Reliance can and Reliance will grow to be among the top 10 business conglomerates of the world,\\\" he said without setting any timelines. Reliance is India's largest corporation by revenues, profits and market value. For this, he asked employees to be 'laser-focused' on always providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. \\\"In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,\\\" he said. At the same time, the company's actions must always win community trust. Also, it must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities. \\\"When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India's inclusive prosperity, and make the world a better place,\\\" he said. Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are -- consolidate Reliance's place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure place among global leaders in institutional culture. \\\"As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation. \\\"In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,\\\" he said. All growth engines of Reliance -- digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences -- will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said. \\\"Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India's urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,\\\" he said. In order to make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to further build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation. \\\"We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,\\\" he said. On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance's culture is to work with the founder's mindset. \\\"It means working with the ownership mindset.\\\" \\\"Each and everyone of you becomes an owner of Reliance when you own the founder's purpose and passion,\\\" he told employees. \\\"Young leaders will commit mistakes. That's for sure. \\\"But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.\\\" Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young, by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s. \\\"Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,\\\" he said referring to his three children.",

    "text": "papa Francisco\nEl papa Francisco sigue hospitalizado y no irá a misa del Jubileo de los Diáconos\nEl Vaticano añadió que el \"cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada\"\nEl papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nLos partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es \"complejo\", por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio\", que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\n\"El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables\", se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia\" de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el \"cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada\", lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.",

    "text": "W here’s the wanker with the drum , the West Ham supporters asked with 10 minutes left at the Emirates Stadium and Arsenal 2-0 down – a question followed by huge cheers as the drum in the home end was bonged defiantly in response.\nLike Arsenal’s players, the drum guy never let up here, never tired, never let his levels drop. But like Arsenal’s players he also only really seemed to have one tune; a riff that everyone on the pitch, opponents included, has heard a little too much already over the past two seasons.\nArsenal’s title hopes hit as old boy Mavropanos seals West Ham win\nRead more There are worse problems to have in life than Saka-dependencia. For one thing, being overly reliant on English football’s outstanding right-sided attacking midfielder does also mean that Bukayo Saka is definitely in your team; and that he looks like English football’s outstanding right‑sided attacking midfielder while he’s there.\nGood teams are always dependent on good players. This is how that equation works. Barcelona were fatally overreliant on Lionel Messi for at least a decade, a sorrowful state of affairs only mitigated by the fact they also won 34 trophies in that period, so something to build on there. The difference with Arsenal, of course, is the sense of a question still in the process of being answered, of a fine team that is just that for now – still an asterisk in the story of titles won and trophies divvied up.\nWest Ham did very little here that was unexpected. But they also looked entirely in control of their own destiny en route to a fine victory, achieved with a single goal in each half. Faced with this, Arsenal spent the first half stroking their chin, doodling on a pad, running through those intricate, lateral patterns and waiting for victory to happen. At times it felt like watching the knockout stages of the world competitive knitting championship. Clickety clack. Here we go again. Another furrow, another row, another attempt to tickle you to death with our mildly abrasive red twine.\nThe most obvious block on Arsenal’s ambitions is the lack of variation in those attacking patterns. Every time he plays, Saka is required to spend vast amounts of energy trying to trick his way past two designated defenders. One thing about having a relentlessly drilled attacking formula is your opponents can also read it, peel it back, predict its outcomes. Here Saïd Benrahma and Emerson Palmieri could be seen literally measuring the space between them with their arms every time Saka got the ball, forming that pre‑planned wall.\nDeclan Rice was left with too much to do against his former club. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images Saka never stopped coming, hit the post, and didn’t have a bad game here. Really, this isn’t his problem to solve. It was more the lack of a proper centre-forward that hurt Arsenal against a team happy to sit deep. This is hardly a mystery story, or a devilish tactical insight. Arsenal lack a goal-bludgeon. They lack a shark. They lack an angry, selfish, horrible player who only pretends to feel ecstatic after wins in which he hasn’t personally scored. Perhaps signing one in January would bring its own problems. Who knows what kind of condition Ivan Toney is in right now. On the other hand, well, just sign a goalscorer.\nThis isn’t just an attacking issue, either. In possession Arsenal looked like a split team at times, with five attackers and five defenders, and Declan Rice delegated the job of making up what a deep midfield should look like.\nIt isn’t just a Saka issue, either. Gabriel Martinelli is also a wonderful player, with the full range of speed, trickery, stamina, bravery. But he also looks like he needs a rest; and a rest that isn’t going to come because if not him, then who?\n Football Daily\nFree daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of\nIt is that lack of variation that might hurt Arsenal now. Liverpool have more flaws but also more scorers. Manchester City have a greater attacking range than any other team on the planet when the machine starts purring. Arsenal, meanwhile, have a 22‑year‑old with bruised ankles and a season-long headache from always having to solve the same problem.\nArteta admits West Ham defeat one of most frustrating nights at Arsenal\nRead more West Ham took the lead early on after an extended VAR‑about to determine if the ball had gone out in the build-up. The second goal was a fine header from a corner by Konstantinos Mavropanos. Arsenal kept coming, didn’t stop, kept running through their scales. The spirit is excellent. The chemistry is good. But this was also a chance missed, and a moment when the limits of Arteta’s current best XI were held up to the light.\nThis should be Arsenal’s hungry period, a run of key games with City still shaking off the jet lag and five points behind. A buffer zone is required, an acorn pile of points, to have any real chance of staying out in front. Arsenal haven’t tended to make major signings in the winter window. This might be a good moment to start.\n Arsenal West Ham United Premier League features\nReuse this content",
