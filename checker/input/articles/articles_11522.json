    "title": "Falcons’ Justin Simmons ‘Looking Forward To Competing Against’ Former Teammate Russell Wilson",
    "text": "The biggest reunion everyone will be watching in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ first game will be former Atlanta Falcons head coach Arthur Smith facing his old team. However, there is another matchup between two players who are familiar with each other that could be fun to watch. The Falcons\nrecently added star safety Justin Simmons, who spent the past eight seasons with the Denver Broncos. That means Simmons is more than familiar with Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson. Talking to the media on Wednesday, Simmons was asked if he’s excited to face Wilson in an actual game.\n“Yeah, for sure,” Simmons said. “The only other time I played against him would’ve been my second year in the league. Other than that, just been teammates in practice. It was fun learning from him. Like I said, all the accolades I gave him earlier. I’m looking forward to competing against him again in a real-time setting where wins and losses count.”\nSimmons and Wilson were together with the Broncos in 2022 and 2023. While people\n have made it seem like everyone in Denver hated Wilson, Simmons seems to have respect for him more than anything. Their first year together was one of Simmons’ best seasons but also Wilson’s worst. However, they both put in decent performances last year before being cut by the Broncos.\nThat game Simmons played against Wilson also came in his third year, not his second year. It was\nWeek 1 of the 2018 season, with Simmons and the Broncos winning the game, 27-24. Simmons did manage to intercept Wilson, so maybe that isn’t a good sign for the Steelers in this upcoming game.\nIn that same media session, Simmons did have a ton of praise for Wilson.\n“Russ is a heck of a competitor, a proven success story in this league. In my opinion, a Hall of Fame quarterback,” he said. “He’s gonna have his things out there, and he’s gonna make his plays and we’re gonna make our plays.”\nWilson’s\nchances at making the Pro Football Hall of Fame have been brought into question recently, but Simmons doesn’t have any doubt his former teammate will be inducted one day. Wilson is a Super Bowl champion, which should help his case, and if he has a decent season with the Steelers, he could really solidify his candidacy.\nWith the game only a few days away, it won’t be long before we see if Simmons improves his record against Wilson or if Wilson can get his win back. Both players have been successful in this league yet that didn’t stop the Broncos from cutting them. Now both of them are on one-year deals, looking to prove they can still play at a high level. In Week 1, we’ll get an idea of how their redemption stories will go.",

    "text": "New Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 leak makes me wonder if Samsung is trying to sell us the same phone twice\nWe may earn a commission if you make a purchase from the links on this page.\nGalaxy Z Fold 6and Flip 6. | Image Credit - PhoneArena\nA new\nGalaxy Z Fold 7and\nZ Flip 7rumor indicates the book-style foldable will come with a Snapdragon chip worldwide, while the Galaxy Flip 7 will have the same RAM and storage as its predecessor.\nRecently, we heard\nsemi-exciting semi-disappointing rumorsabout the potential Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 pricing. The\nGalaxy S25is not even on shelves yet (although\nsome people are getting their pre-orders early), but the leakers have moved on and are now spilling the beans on the upcoming Galaxy foldable flagships.\nThe leaker who has shared the latest infoabout the two foldables by\nSamsungis the same one who shared their potential prices not too long ago. They may not be the most known leaker out there, but they claim to have information from Galaxy Z Fold 7 prototypes which indicate the phone is powered by Snapdragon only.\nThis corroborates earlier rumors about the beast-y foldable that claimed that this one won't come with the Exynos 2500, but with the Snapdragon 8 Elite which is in the Galaxy S25 series.\nThere's one little catch though: it may not be the exact same chip as the S25, as there's a\n7-core version that Qualcomm has introduced for foldablesor slimmer phones. It may not be as different from the standard 8-core version but it will likely be a little bit weaker in terms of benchmark performance (though with few differences in real life, I'd say).\nAccording to the leak, the Fold 7 will rock 12GB of RAM and will be available with 256GB, 52GB, and 1TB of storage. This would be on par with the\nGalaxy S25 Ultra, and 12 gigs of RAM would probably be enough, but I can't help but frown a little bit.\nAfter all, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is downright marketed as a multitasking-friendly device with this big foldable screen, and maybe it would have been better if the phone came equipped with a\n16GB RAM option, but oh well, we can't always get what we want, right?\nMeanwhile, the tipster also shares the storage config variants of the clamshell foldable Z Flip 7. This beauty will reportedly come with 12GB of RAM as well, and either 256 or 512GB of storage, and those specs seem more reasonable for a phone that's going for an attractive look and compact form factor rather than a power-user device.\nThe Exynos 2500 specs recently leaked, and we're hoping it may be on par with the 8 Elite despite Samsung's own chips notoriously performing a tad slower than Qualcomm's.\nThe two phones are expected to be announced sometime in the summer. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 will have the tough task of going up against the\nworld's slimmest foldable(the Oppo Find N5) and potentially the\nPixel 10 Pro Foldfor the title of the\nbest foldable phone. Meanwhile, the Flip 7 will have to face the next-gen Motorola Razr. Apple's contender (the long-awaited\nfoldable iPhone) will likely not show its pretty face this year, so no competition for Cupertino this time.\nLoading Comments...",
