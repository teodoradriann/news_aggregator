    "text": "In a monumental effort to bolster environmental conservation, the Uttar Pradesh government is gearing up to create history by planting over 36.50 crore saplings across the state on July 20. Under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the ambitious ‘Ped Lagao, Ped Bachao Jan Abhiyan-2024’ will kick off in Akbarnagar, Lucknow, marking a significant step towards a greener future. Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam’, 54.20 crore saplings have been nurtured in nurseries and other facilities. Ministers-in-charge across the state are actively mobilising efforts to ensure the campaign’s success, each overseeing strategic planting initiatives in their respective districts. In preparation for the massive plantation drive, nodal officers have been appointed in every district, tasked with overseeing logistics and ensuring smooth execution. These officers will commence their duties on Friday, conducting final inspections to ensure readiness for the monumental event. On July 20, offices, schools, and institutions statewide will halt regular activities for half a day to participate in the tree planting endeavour. CM Yogi will plant saplings in Akbarnagar, which was cleared of encroachments for the purpose of reviving Kukrail river. Forest Minister Arun Kumar Saxena will also plant saplings in Lucknow. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya will plant saplings in Prayagraj and Kaushambi, and Deputy CM Brajesh Pathak in Unnao and Kanpur Dehat.

On the instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, officers at the level of principal secretary/chief secretary/secretary have been appointed as nodal officers for the ‘Ped Lagao-Ped Bachao Jan Abhiyan-2024’ (Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam) campaign. Alok Kumar will serve as the nodal officer for Lucknow in the capacity of Principal Secretary (Sports and Youth Welfare), while Anil Garg has been appointed as the nodal officer for Ayodhya for tree planting under the principal secretary (Irrigation and Water Resources). Principal Secretary (Technical Education) M. Devaraj is named the nodal officer for Prayagraj. In PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi, Managing Director of Jal Mission Gramin Dr Raj Shekhar has been appointed as the nodal officer.

Additionally, in Agra, Additional Chief Secretary (Housing and Urban Planning) Nitin Ramesh Gokarn will serve as the nodal officer, and Principal Secretary (Prison Administration) Rajesh Kumar Singh will fulfil this role in Aligarh. Under the campaign, saplings will be planted across all 18 divisions. The highest target has been set for Lucknow division, where over 41.73 lakh saplings will be planted.

These form the company’s first formal layoffs since 2009, reported WSJ. The layoffs could affect around 2.5% of the U.S. unit’s workforce. Those who may be let go will be notified next month, per the outlet. The affected departments could include the U.S. advisory and products and technology operations. A range of employees in various sectors could come under its scope, claimed the sources. The company’s technology group could also undergo restructuring in the process. Decisions related to company products and investments are also set to be taken. A number of large tech and business firms have announced layoffs this year, including Intel, Salesforce, Cisco, and PayPal. Published - September 13, 2024 02:30 pm IST",

    "text": "FRIENDSWOOD, Texas — A Texas teenager accused of shooting two people at his home, one fatally, allegedly told police that he wanted to \"commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to newly released court documents. The suspect -- 17-year-old Connor Hilton -- was showing the two victims a revolver at his Friendswood home Saturday night when he allegedly shot them both in the head, according to a complaint charging the teen with murder. A third person who was at the house that night called 911 while hiding in the bathroom and reported hearing two gunshots, according to the complaint. Responding officers found Hilton outside the home appearing \"visibly distraught,\" the complaint stated. When asked by police if anyone was hurt, Hilton nodded yes then held up two fingers, motioned toward the house and said there were two teenagers inside he believed to be dead, according to the complaint. Once inside, an officer found two male victims -- identified as Ethan Riley, 18, and Benjamin Bliek, 19 -- lying on the floor with gunshot wounds as well as a revolver on a table, according to the complaint. A second officer located the 911 caller, who \"reported hearing Hilton walk by the bathroom door crying and stating, 'What have I done,'\" the complaint stated. The shooting victims were transported to local hospitals in critical condition. Riley succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, while Bliek remains in critical condition, police said. Hilton was brought in for questioning following the shooting and was initially charged by the Galveston County District Attorney's Office with two counts of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He was released after posting $1 million bond before being arrested again at his home on Monday for murder, police said. He is currently being held at the Galveston County Jail on no bond. While being interviewed by police following the shooting, Hilton allegedly confessed to pulling the trigger and said there was no disturbance or disagreement that night, according to the complaint. He allegedly told police \"he had thought about, and wanted, to commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to the complaint. He allegedly said he had talked his mother into buying him a handgun, which he wanted \"with the intent of shooting someone and/or himself,\" according to the complaint. \"Hilton stated that he fully understands what he had done and that he should be held accountable,\" the complaint stated. Hilton's attorney, Jennifer Carpenter, told ABC News that his mother did not purchase a gun for him. \"The parents of Connor Hilton cannot express enough their deepest condolences to the victims' families who have been heavily on the Hiltons' hearts and minds as they try to navigate this devastating situation,\" Hilton's family said in a statement released through the attorney on Thursday. \"The Hilton family wants to thank everyone who has reached out in love and support, including all who sent positive comments about Connor's character and good nature in general,\" the statement continued. \"The family asks for continued prayers for everyone affected, especially the victims' families.\" His attorney has filed a motion seeking to conduct a hearing to determine whether his statements to police can be admissible in court, claiming they were not made and preserved in compliance with state law. Hilton is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference on Feb. 2, online court records show. Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Manglares de Córdoba ha evitado emisiones de miles de toneladas de CO2 en Colombia",
    "text": "Los manglares Bahía de Cispatá, La Balsa y Tinajones desempeñan un papel determinante en la lucha contra el cambio climático. A la fecha, estos ecosistemas han evitado la emisión de más de 69 mil toneladas de dióxido de carbono (CO₂) a la atmósfera , lo que a su vez limita la producción de gases efecto de invernadero (GEI).Según los estudios presentados en la última cumbre del clima (COP28), en 2023 el planeta emitió más de 36 mil millones de toneladas de CO₂. En Colombia, la meta para 2030 es reducir las emisiones de GEI en un 51 %. Para ello el cuidado y la preservación de los ecosistemas que contribuyen a la captura de CO₂ es fundamental. Los manglares del golfo de Morrosquillo, ubicados en los municipios de San Antero, San Bernardo del Viento y Santa Cruz de Lorica , en el departamento de Córdoba, fueron declarados área marina protegida por la Corporación Autónoma Regional de los Valles del Sinú y del San Jorge (CVS), pues están entre los más importantes de la región Caribe y del país, debido a su estado de preservación y al servicio ecosistémico que prestan.“Bahía de Cispatá, La Balsa y Tinajones constituyen el ecosistema de manglar mejor conservado del Caribe colombiano, debido a las acciones continuas que se realizan en el área a través de la articulación institucional y comunitaria desde hace más de 30 años. Hoy constituyen el segundo sistema de manglares más importante de Colombia , por su modelo de uso sostenible de la madera de mangle, sumado a los años de investigación, actividades de monitoreo y restauración, que han permitido estimar cuánto CO₂ retiene para evitar su emisión a la atmósfera”, explicó Rafael Espinosa, biólogo marino y jefe de calidad ambiental de la CVS. Estas acciones que menciona hacen parte del proyecto Vida Manglar , liderado por la CVS, en alianza con la Corporación Autónoma Regional de Sucre (Carsucre), el Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras de Colombia (Invemar), la Fundación Omacha, Conservación Internacional Colombia, asociaciones de mangleros organizados y legalizados, y el sector turístico local.Su objetivo es la reducción de emisiones GEI, a través del manejo y uso sostenible del ecosistema de manglar de una forma altamente participativa. “Hay unos métodos para medir la cantidad de carbono a través de laboratorio. Entonces hacemos una medición en las hojas, en las raíces y en el sustrato y eso nos indica cuánto carbono está capturando cada manglar. Por medio de unos algoritmos y fórmulas, nosotros determinamos qué tantas toneladas de CO₂ hay almacenadas en este ecosistema”, precisó Espinosa.De acuerdo con la CVS, el programa Vida Manglar identificó la reducción de 69.027 toneladas de dióxido de carbono en los manglares del golfo de Morrosquillo . Ahora la meta es evitar la emisión de 939.296 ton de CO₂ hasta el año 2045, lo que representa un promedio de 31.310 toneladas por año.Por cuenta de esta labor, Vida Manglar es el primer proyecto de carbono azul en el mundo que cuenta con las certificaciones VCS (estándares de carbono certificado), CCB (Clima, Comunidad y Biodiversidad), y la aprobación de Verra, líder mundial en la creación de estándares para la acción climática, el desarrollo sostenible y la comercialización de créditos de carbono para la conservación.Para seguir financiando las labores de investigación y conservación en los manglares del golfo de Morrosquillo, mediante Vida Manglar se logró la venta de 68 mil toneladas de bonos de carbono, a un promedio de 24 dólares por tonelada . Además, se han logrado acuerdos con los propietarios de predios vecinos para reducir su impacto ambiental directo en el ecosistema.Las comunidades también se beneficianLos ingresos obtenidos por la conservación de los manglares han permitido impulsar iniciativas productivas y sostenibles, desarrollar programas de monitoreo para conservar la biodiversidad del área protegida, y brindar beneficios socioeconómicos (ingresos y alimentos) a las comunidades locales que dependen del aprovechamiento circular de la madera de mangle y de los recursos pesqueros asociados al manglar.“El programa vincula a las comunidades que hacen parte del uso sostenible del ecosistema, directa e indirectamente, implementando acciones a través de contratación directa con ellos. También implementamos proyectos agro para la producción de cultivos de arroz, yuca y berenjena. En total, hemos beneficiado a 486 familias de la zona e impactado a otras 190.383 . Además, hemos fortalecido cuatro asociaciones ecoturísticas y cuatro asociaciones de apicultura y meliponicultura desde su plan de negocios y sus capacidades de producción y marca”, precisó Espinosa.Por su parte, Luis Canchila, representante legal de la comunidad manglera de San Bernardo, señaló que “el manglar es muy importante para nuestras comunidades, ya que nos sirve como barrera de protección a la erosión marino-costera y a los fuertes oleajes. Nos ha traído grandes beneficios en la mitigación de gases de efecto invernadero, no sólo para nuestra región, sino para todo el mundo ; y ha sido esencial para nuestro sostenimiento y el de nuestras familias”.Restauración y conservaciónLa articulación entre las instituciones ambientales y las comunidades ha permitido la conservación y gestión de 8.570 hectáreas de manglar y la restauración de otras 316,5 hectáreas en los últimos cuatro años . Además, se realizó una siembra comunitaria de 209.000 plántulas de mangle para mitigar la erosión costera dentro del área protegida y se rehabilitaron 23.3 kilómetros de caños, en un trabajo conjunto con las comunidades de mangleros organizados en San Antero y San Bernardo del Viento.Asimismo, mediante una iniciativa liderada por el Ministerio de Ambiente, con recursos del gobierno alemán KFW, se implementó el proyecto MABE (Medidas de adaptación para la mitigación de la erosión costera); que contribuyó en 2022 a la siembra de 52 hectáreas de bosque manglar y la rehabilitación de 4.590 metros de caño, a cargo de la Fundación Omacha. Con esta misma estrategia, en el 2023 se sembraron 55.2 hectáreas y rehabilitaron 2.000 metros de caño por parte de la Fundación ONF Andina.Proteger al caimán agujaAdemás de las acciones de restauración, Vida Manglar desarrolla actividades de monitoreo para la conservación de especies de la región como el manatí antillano, la nutria de río y el caimán aguja.“Desde hace 20 años hemos trabajado articulados con la asociación Asocaimán, realizando monitoreos biológicos y registrando un total de 1.219 individuos de caimán aguja, de los cuales 882 son adultos y 417 jóvenes. Hacemos la recolección de nidos y la valoración de cada individuo porque es una especie en estado crítico . Sin embargo, en Cispatá logramos que 18 cazadores se convirtieran en los conservacionistas de esta especie”, concluyó Espinosa.",
