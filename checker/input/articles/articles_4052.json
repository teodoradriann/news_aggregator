    "text": "Local veteran’s battle with trauma transforms into healing through music COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - A local army veteran is helping other former soldiers heal - years after his combat deployments, including a famous battle from the War in Afghanistan. Now there’s a new song telling that story. Some of the first lyrics are: “Years of heat and battle, 4 deployments deep, took a toll on my life, night terrors in my sleep, I cried out for help, and the Lord heard me.” The just-released song “Warriors Set Free” is about Army combat veteran James Clark and others like him. He co-wrote that tune. The retired 1st Sgt deployed twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan, where he was involved in that war’s second costliest firefight, 300 Taliban fighters assaulting the U.S. soldiers at COP Keating, as portrayed in the movie “The Outpost.” “My ‘come to Jesus’ moment is when I got injured in 2009 at the Battle of Kamdesh,” 1SG (Ret) James Clark said. “When we got attacked, it was overwhelming for us, simultaneous attacks. We lost 8 guys during that fight. It was a day-to-day and a half battle.” It was tough for James Clark to move on from that trauma, but he believes God spared him for a reason. He got connected with the Columbus-based nonprofit Warriors Set Free which guides military and veterans in healing from their past, and faith walks that help in winning life’s battles. “Moving from kicking in doors and doing direct gunfight battles...is now more of a spiritual warfare for me,” he describes. “It’s a testimony of God’s grace and mercy...transformational,” Tim Maggart said about hearing Clark’s military story at an Operation Song retreat. Fellow Army veteran and singer/songwriter Maggart said he then worked with Clark on the lyrics and now performs the song they created, to hopefully help inspire other vets. As he sings about in Warriors Set Free, “The mission’s changed but we’re still on the battlefield.” You can hear the full song [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/71Y7gxRldfsGq0pNfZUwfb?si=930427c932d7472f&nd=1&dlsi=2b48bdaea20f4a68). Clark said, “Tim started singing it and I started tearing up. I still do every time he plays it.” “That anyone who hears it, it will minister to them, but also get the word out (about Warriors Set Free nonprofit), I believe in what these guys are doing,” Maggart said. Clark got involved with that organization first by going through a one-day Freedom Appointment to address problems like his anger and addictions or a “spiritual house cleansing” as he calls it. [Here’s more](https://warriorssetfree.org/georgia/) on the nonprofit chapter based in Columbus. “Just to know they’ve got brothers that will walk that out with them. You don’t have to be alone. You don’t have to be in the bottle,” Clark added. Warriors Set Free - where he’s now the mission outreach coordinator - also has four-day men’s events called “Warriors Battle” where vets can elevate their faith walk. At their latest one, 17 of the 22 men surrendered to the Lord and got baptized. There was also a concert with their newly adopted song with a chorus that repeats “We are his child...we are warriors set free.” Copyright 2024 WTVM. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Malicious App Found on Amazon Appstore Masquerades as Health Tool",
    "text": "McAfee Labs uncovered a malicious app on the Amazon Appstore that disguised itself as a simple health tool while secretly stealing sensitive user data. The app, named “BMI CalculationVsn”, pretended to offer basic body mass index (BMI) calculations but engaged in covert activities like SMS interception and device monitoring.\nAt first glance, BMI CalculationVsn appeared to be a harmless app. As McAfee noted, “ On the surface, this app appears to be a basic tool, providing a single page where users can input their weight and height to calculate their BMI .” However, hidden beneath this simple interface were sinister capabilities designed to compromise user privacy.\nApplication published on Amazon Appstore | Source: McAfee\nUpon closer inspection, McAfee researchers identified several alarming activities:\nScreen Recording : The app initiated a background service to record the screen whenever users clicked the “Calculate” button. While this functionality was incomplete and didn’t upload recordings to a command-and-control (C2) server, its presence indicates the developer’s intent to capture sensitive user inputs like gesture passwords. App Scanning : The spyware scanned devices for installed applications, likely to identify potential targets for further attacks. SMS Interception : Most concerning was its ability to intercept incoming SMS messages, including one-time passwords (OTP) and verification codes, which were stored on Firebase under the storage bucket testmlwr-d4dd7.appspot.com . The app appeared to be a work in progress, with its evolution traced back to October 2024. Initially a simple screen recording app, it later adopted the BMI calculator interface, and SMS stealing capabilities were added in the latest version. The timeline, as detailed by McAfee, revealed that the app was still under active development, with the Firebase API address using the term “testmlwr,” indicating a testing phase.\nInterestingly, the app listed its developer as “ PT. Visionet Data Internasional ”, the name of a legitimate enterprise IT management provider in Indonesia. McAfee suggests this was a deliberate move to gain user trust, noting, “ The malware author tricked users by abusing the names of an enterprise IT management service provider in Indonesia .”\nAfter McAfee reported the app, Amazon quickly removed it from the Appstore. The discovery of BMI CalculationVsn is a sobering reminder of how even seemingly innocuous apps can harbor significant risks. As McAfee puts it, “Apps like ‘BMI CalculationVsn’ serve as a stark reminder that even the simplest tools can harbor hidden threats.”\nRelated Posts:",

Jet2 issued a weather disruption alert for Skiathos on its website at 4.15am today. The company, which serves the island from seven UK airports, said: “Due to adverse weather conditions forecast for Skiathos on Friday 10th May 2024, we have delayed all Skiathos flights until tomorrow. “If you are travelling to Skiathos today, please do not travel to the airport. “If you are due to travel back to the UK today, please continue to check our website.

    "text": "The bird flu, currently spreading through animals and some people, is known to scientists as Type A H5N1 influenza. But there are different strains. A version known as B3.13 was confirmed after spreading to cattle in late 2023. It has infected 962 cattle herds in 16 states, with the vast majority in California. A newer version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on January 31, 2025. It was found in milk collected as part of a monitoring program started in December.\nThis discovery means distinct forms of the virus have spread from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts in the United States indicate concerns regarding the broader spread of infections and the challenges in controlling them in both animals and the people who work with them. This comes after the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees in all federal departments. The cuts included nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — roughly one-tenth of the agency’s workforce.
