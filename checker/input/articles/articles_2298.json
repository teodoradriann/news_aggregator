    "title": "Global Times: Senior vloggers embrace vibrant twilight years in fashionable ways, showcase a more dignified old age with stronger security",
    "text": "BEIJING , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- In a short video, silver-haired \"Grandma Wu\" demonstrates various physics experiments using everyday items. She uses an iron pot to simulate the radio telescope, a broom to simulate cosmic rays in space, a badminton racket to simulate a positron-electron collider, and ginkgo leaves to make origami butterflies. Grandma Wu also invites the viewer to speculate whether the universe has an end and whether parallel universes truly exist.\nAt 73, the retired university professor boasts a following of more than 1.72 million subscribers after around three years of posting on video-sharing social media platform Bilibili and another 5.2 million followers on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, becoming China's latest internet influencer as science education gains mass appeal.\nIn late 2022, the \"silver-haired knowledge vlogger\" group, which went viral, won the \"Touching China 2022 Annual Figures\" award. The average age of the 13 vloggers was 77 years old, and Wu was among them. They include academicians at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, retired university professors, and ex-elementary and middle school teachers. They use trendy language, short videos and live broadcasts to share scientific and humanistic knowledge that young people are interested in. Unlike the traditional stereotypical impression of the elderly in Chinese society, these bloggers represent a new image in the eyes of young people.\nThey are pictures of twilight-age vitality, enjoying life on their own terms, rather than only focusing on the busy lives of their children and grandchildren.\nLiving in a society of accelerated population aging, how can we ensure that the elderly have support, happiness, and security in their old age? How can institutionalized guarantees bring about a more dignified later life and enable them to embrace more possibilities? These \"fashionable seniors\" active on short video platforms provide us with answers.\nPassion for life never fades\nWu had the idea of making short videos as early as 2018. In her popular science videos, she breaks away from the seriousness of traditional physics classrooms and explains unfamiliar concepts in plain terms. For Wu, inspiring curiosity in young people is one of the most fulfilling things she has been longing for, and she is using this dream to inspire the dreams of more youngsters.\nIn a recent interview with the Global Times, Wu said that years of physics and science education have made her realize that people can only maintain a desire to learn if they maintain curiosity. \"Having conversations with young people in their way\" is one of Wu's current wishes. She hopes to convey the enthusiasm she presents in front of the camera to all young people who watch her videos, helping them see their self-worth, gain confidence and a sense of responsibility, learn how to conduct research, collaborate effectively, and dare to challenge themselves.\nWu's busy schedule and energy level are no less than those of young people today. She also devotes herself to online courses, offline lectures, and scientific education practice activities. The vibrant and energetic life she presents in front of the camera has become the envy of and an aspiration to many young people.\nThe silver-haired vlogger's New Year's wish is for her later years to be \"fresher, happier, and more carefree.\"\nCares from youngsters never late\n\"Bob\" is the English name given to Wang Li , a 62-year-old who lives in the Jingya nursing home in North China's Tianjin Municipality. After the popularity of the short drama video series in which Wang participated, an English blogger specially visited the nursing home and gave each elderly person a trendy English name. Since April, \"Funny Things in the Funny Nursing Home\" has gained over 1 million fans online, with the highest-viewed video gaining over 200 million views. In the videos, the nursing home residents are optimistic and cheerful, and never shy away from discussing aging and death.\nOne of the common themes in the short drama series is popularizing chemical knowledge. In the short video, 90-year-old Yu Youfang, who used to be a chemistry teacher at a high school in Tianjin , leans on a walking aid and holds a teaching cane to tap on the table. She is surrounded by a group of students in their seventies and eighties who even wear high school uniforms donated by their grandchildren. In this chemistry class scenario, there are always \"students\" causing explosions or producing poisonous gas due to \"improper operation.\" The \"students\" are then comically carried away on stretchers in the classroom, hooked up to IV drips, and occasionally need oxygen as part of first aid remedies administered in adjoining classrooms... Netizens rightly albeit jokingly note: \"Attending class is quite 'killing' students.\"\nOne of the main characters in the series, Bob, used to be an entrepreneur. He suffered a stroke in his middle age, leaving him with the sequelae of being unable to lift his left arm. Illness, divorce, and the death of his mother... A series of tragedies once left this man in his early 60s completely devastated. When he first arrived at the nursing home, he hardly socialized with anyone. He would always sit alone on the edge of the bed, with the skin on his fingertips discolored from smoking.\nAfter joining the short video cast, Bob's life has turned a new page. He likes the feeling of being greeted in the videos by younger netizens, and has also ventured out of the nursing home with his companions to see the sea for the first time.\nFeng Yan , one of the creators of the video series at the nursing home, told the Global Times that the original intention for filming was to eliminate public fear of nursing homes and anxiety surrounding life and death.\nThe content of the videos helps the elderly to awaken the memories of their youth. \"We want to help them extend their social lives, reconnect with society, and make everyone feel cared for,\" Feng said. \"In fact, most of these elderly people are not afraid of death, but are afraid of being forgotten.\"\n\"To let others see their inner world, to see their vibrant state, is a dream that many elderly people in nursing homes cannot express,\" Feng said.\nThe emerging creative trend of the silver generation is also gradually spreading in many nursing homes and senior universities in various cities.\nIn another nursing home in Xuchang, Central China's Henan Province , residents wear sunglasses and \"DJ\" dynamic music. According to media reports, this nursing home not only provides free accommodation but also has recreational facilities such as e-sports rooms, cinemas, painting and calligraphy rooms, and small bars. Fan Jinlin, a Gen-Z nursing home owner, told media that he wants to tell people that the elderly are also trendy and love to have fun, and nursing homes can be full of vitality.\nAt the same time, Chengdu University for the Aged has added many \"trendy courses\" in recent years, such as drone piloting, video editing, and even street dancing, all of which are fully booked according to media reports.\nGuarantee and support never absent\nA more comprehensive healthcare insurance system, an encouragement for the silver economy, an increased investment in elderly education resources, and a more open and diverse social culture - China is striving to establish an elderly-friendly society against the backdrop of a rapidly aging population.\nAccording to data released by the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs in December, by the end of 2022, the population aged 60 and above in China accounted for 19.8 percent of the total population, with the population aged 65 and above accounting for 14.9 percent, approaching the stage of moderate aging.\nMeanwhile, estimates by the National Health Commission predicted that by around 2035, the population aged 60 and above in China will exceed 400 million, accounting for over 30 percent of the total population. By then, China may enter the stage of severe aging.\nProfessor Li Chenghua from Nanjing University believes that Chinese modernization is complementary to actively addressing population aging. On one hand, the new goals and characteristics of Chinese modernization process provide new opportunities and guarantees for actively addressing population aging, helping to further establish a new situation of respecting and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the elderly. On the other hand, the realization of Chinese modernization cannot be separated from the contributions of the elderly.\nChina has a ctively addressed population aging problem by promoting the resolution of the practical needs of the elderly in areas such as elderly care, health, spiritual and cultural life, and social participation, and striving to meet the new expectations of hundreds of millions of elderly people for a better life.\nAs a practitioner in the elderly care industry, Feng feels increased societal attention to elderly issues and meticulous care for the elderly in his daily work.\nDuring a recent visit to a zoo organized by Jingya nursing home, Feng was deeply moved by the support of the volunteers throughout the journey. \"We provided each elderly person with a wheelchair, and almost all public toilets had wheelchair-accessible facilities. Volunteers were enthusiastic in helping at every step. We also received many care packages from various sectors of society, some of which were anonymous,\" Feng said.\nHe believes that a comprehensive elderly care service system is currently being built, and his wish is to see an age-friendly society; a civilized environment where the elderly can \"be themselves freely.\"\nChen Yuan , the head of Jingya nursing home, told the Global Times that he hopes to attract more young people to enter the elderly care industry and pay attention to the spiritual needs of the elderly through short videos. \"The nursing home is not the last stop in the elderly's life, but another 'home' given to them by society,\" Chen said.\nFeng is increasingly proud of his profession. He knows that he is exploring a path of \"building a more friendly society for the elderly\" endowed by the Chinese modernization process.\nHolding up his phone and seeing \"actor\" Bob dancing happily like a child, Feng smiles on the other side of the camera. This moment connects his dream with the collective dreams of senior citizens in nursing homes across the country.\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202312/1304408.shtml\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-senior-vloggers-embrace-vibrant-twilight-years-in-fashionable-ways-showcase-a-more-dignified-old-age-with-stronger-security-302023134.html\nSOURCE Global Times\nCopyright 2023 PR Newswire",

    "title": "Obispo Salvador Rangel reaparece en misa; fiscalía insiste en hipótesis de secuestro e identificó a un presunto responsable",
    "text": "Salvador Rangel Mendoza , obispo emérito de la Diócesis de Chilpancingo-Chilapa , reapareció este jueves 23 de mayo en una misa en la catedral de Chilapa, a casi un mes de su desaparición y posterior localización en un hospital de Morelos. “Oremos por el monseñor Salvador Rangel que lo teníamos perdido y afortunadamente está con vida”, dijo el obispo de la diócesis José de Jesús González Hernández, quien estuvo presente en la misa. Lee: Localizan con vida a Salvador Rangel, obispo que había sido reportado como desaparecido en Morelos En una breve transmisión de video en vivo, a través de las redes sociales de la Diócesis, se observa a Salvador Rangel en la celebración eclesiástica; sin embargo, no tomó la palabra durante todo el oficio. Días antes de su reaparición, el Obismo dio a conocer que no presentará ninguna denuncia en contra de sus agresores. “En ejercicio de mis derechos constitucionales, no presentaré ninguna denuncia contra las personas que tanto mal me han hecho”, informó en un comunicado el pasado 8 de mayo. Un día antes de la reaparición del obispo, Uriel Carmona Gándara, fiscal de Morelos, dio a conocer que ya identificaron a una persona que posiblemente esté involucrada en la desaparición del prelado. “Ya tenemos una persona a la que estamos buscando para cuestionarlo en relación a esos hechos”, dijo. El funcionario insitió en que Salvador Rangel fue víctima de un delito, por lo que continuarán con la línea de investigación sobre el presunto secuestro. “Hasta donde vamos, el obispo emérito fue víctima de un delito y vamos a dar con el responsable”, explicó. Lee: Fiscalía y Seguridad de Morelos se contradicen respecto a lo que ocurrió con el obispo de Guerrero; Episcopado pide no especular Carmona aseguró que la línea de investigación sobre el secuestro está fundamentada en investigaciones, informes periciales, videos, declaraciones y otros datos verificables. El obispo Salvador Rangel Mendoza desapareció la tarde del 27 de abril . Dos días después fue localizado con vida en un hospital de Morelos. Tras darse a conocer la noticia, el fiscal de Morelos dijo que una de las líneas de investigación era un probable secuestro exprés. Sin embargo, el caso de la desaparición y posterior localización con vida del obispo tuvo contradicciones de las mismas autoridades, particularmente de la Fiscalía y la Comisión Estatal de Seguridad Pública de Morelos. Las versiones respecto a lo que pudo haber ocurrido con el religioso cambiaron de manera radical, ya que tanto el gobernador interino de Morelos, Samuel Sotelo, como el titular de la Comisión Estatal de Seguridad Pública (CES), José Antonio Ortiz Guarneros, dijeron que no hay indicios de un secuestro. Según el titular de Seguridad Pública, el obispo supuestamente entró, de manera voluntaria, a un motel con otra persona. “Hasta donde sabemos entró voluntariamente a un motel, con una persona del mismo sexo, esa persona después se retiró”, explicó el titular de seguridad. Posteriormente, el gobernador interino coincidió con Ortiz Guarneros respecto a que no hay evidencia sobre un posible secuestro. “No tenemos, hasta el día de hoy, un solo elemento para determinar que haya sido privado de la libertad como tal; los datos que se tienen objetivos es que hubo dos retiros, de dos cajeros, uno en la mañana del sábado y otro en la tarde noche, pero no hay una cámara que haya visto que lo hayan privado de la libertad”, aseguró el gobernador. Con información de Amapola Periodismo Tomás Ross sufre la distrofia muscular Duchenne. Su madre, Camila Gómez, libra una carrera kilométrica contra el tiempo para conseguir fondos para su tratamiento. Caminar los más de 1.300 kilómetros que separan la comuna de Ancud en Chiloé con el Palacio de la Moneda en Santiago en Chile puede parecer una quimera para muchos. No así para la chilena Camila Gómez, una madre que completa este desafío con el objetivo de recaudar 3.500 millones de pesos (US$3.740) para comprar un medicamento vital para su hijo de cinco años y visibilizar la causa de pacientes con enfermedades raras en Chile. El tiempo apremia. Su niño, Tomás Ross, sufre distrofia muscular Duchenne, una dolencia severa que empeora con rapidez. Si no recibe el fármaco cuanto antes, será difícil detener la enfermedad. “Es un medicamento muy caro y una enfermedad que en Chile no tiene oportunidades, pero sí las hay en el extranjero”, le dice Gómez a BBC Mundo. Miles de chilenos se volcaron con el caso de Gómez, cuya determinación se viralizó por el país. La madre partió de Ancud el pasado 28 de abril junto a Marcos Reyes, presidente de la corporación Familias Duchenne en Chile, quien también tiene dos niños adolescentes con la enfermedad. Fue precisamente Reyes quien le sugirió a Gómez la idea de la caminata. “Caminanos por todos los niños y familias que sufren la enfermedad. El tiempo se acaba”, dijo Gómez en una entrevista con el noticiero nacional 24 horas. El objetivo, además de recaudar fondos y visibilizar sus causas, es conseguir que el presidente chileno Gabriel Boric “lleve un proyecto de ley al Congreso” que permita mejorar la cobertura de enfermedades raras en el país, según le explica Reyes a BBC Mundo. Tomás Ross fue diagnosticado con Duchenne en marzo 2023. “Nació sanito, sin ningún problema ni complicación, hasta que a los cuatro años nos dimos cuenta de que tenía dificultad para subir escaleras y realizar algunos tipos de actividad física“, contó Gómez en redes sociales. “Hasta ese momento no había cura, pero desde hace unos meses tenemos una esperanza; en EE.UU se aprobó el primer medicamento cuyo objetivo es detener la progresión de la enfermedad”, continuó Gómez. Este fármaco se comercializa como elevidys y se administra vía intravenosa en pacientes que, como Ross, tienen entre cuatro y cinco años. Existen varios tipos de distrofia muscular, aunque Duchenne es la forma más común y también una de las más severas. La enfermedad se desata debido a un gen defectuoso que resulta en la ausencia de distrofina, una proteína que ayuda a mantener intactas las células del cuerpo. Los pacientes pueden desarrollar problemas al caminar y correr, fatiga, dificultades de aprendizaje y deficiencias cardiacas y respiratorias por el debilitamiento de músculos vitales en estas funciones. Los servicios nacionales de salud británicos indican que normalmente afecta a niños de temprana edad y que las personas con esta dolencia normalmente viven hasta los 20 o 30 años. Gómez habla con BBC Mundo este domingo 12 de mayo en “una pequeña pausa, mientras come un poquitico”. Ya lleva más de dos semanas de una travesía a la que le queda alrededor de la mitad. Al momento de hablar se encuentra en el peaje de Púa, en la Región de la Araucanía, todavía a más de 600 kilómetros de la capital. “Es una locura esta travesía, pero creemos que está resultando más de lo imaginado”, dice Gómez. La primera semana fue dura, pero la madre cuenta que con el paso de los días todo va resultando más fácil. “Es impresionante cómo el cuerpo se adapta al ritmo y ya no es tan terrible”, comenta. También le ayuda el impulso emocional que recibió por sorpresa el pasado viernes 10 de mayo con motivo del Día de la Madre. Su hijo Tomás la encontró en la ciudad de Temuco, acompañado por su padre Alex Ross, para darle un abrazo, un ramo de flores y una recarga de ánimos. “El niño sabe que su mamá reúne platica para encontrarle un remedio, pero solo estuvo un ratico y se volvió para Chiloé. Por la enfermedad que tiene no se debe refriar”, le dice Alex Ross a BBC Mundo. Hasta el 10 de mayo, la familia había conseguido recaudar más de la mitad de los fondos. Gómez documenta su recorrido en sus cuentas en redes sociales, donde recibe miles de mensajes de apoyo, cientos de miles de visualizaciones en sus videos, la atención de la prensa y la compañía de otros caminantes que se unen en algunos tramos de su recorrido. “Esto creció tanto que debo ayudar con todo el tema logístico: les busco alojamiento, alimentación, les asisto en la ruta con ropa seca, busco podólogos, kinesiólogos y medicamentos”, dice Alex Ross. Camila Gómez y Marcos Reyes esperan llegar a La Moneda a fines de mayo, dependiendo de las condiciones climatológicas. Un largo camino para visibilizar sus causas que va más allá de los más de 1.300 kilómetros que habrán recorrido al término de su trayecto. Haz clic aquí para leer más historias de BBC News Mundo.

    "text": "Iraq pulled off the first upset of the Asian Cup in Qatar when they beat tournament favourites Japan 2-1 on Friday in the group phase.Aymen Hussein scored both goals in the first half for Iraq, who are ranked 63 in the world to Japan's 17, to put them into the last 16. Wataru Endo pulled a goal back at the death. The win is Iraq's first over Japan in 42 years and it also helped the side qualify for the knockout stage.Japan were unbeaten against the West Asian side in their last nine games and Iraq's victory propelled them to the top of the group standings with six points from two games while Hajime Moriyasu's side have three points.Roared on by thousands of Iraqi supporters in the stadium, Iraq got on the board inside five minutes when Japan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki failed to deal with a cross, parrying the ball straight to Hussein who headed it into the top corner.Iraq's strategy to unsettle Japan was to stay compact and use their physicality early on, which worked to an extent until the East Asian side began using their pace and finding space on the wings to put crosses into the box.But Iraq doubled their lead on the stroke of halftime when Ahmed Al-Hajjaj skipped past his marker and floated in a cross that was headed home from point-blank range by Hussein as the Iraqi fans at the Education City Stadium went delirious.Moriyasu made five substitutions after the restart and, although Japan had a penalty claim denied after a VAR check, they did not test the keeper until the 94th minute when Wataru Endo headed home at the far post from a corner.(With inputs from Reuters)",

    "text": "Image: Taika Waititi as The Viscount in FING! courtesy of King Bert Productions and Story Brdge Films\nProduction has commenced at Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane on King Bert Productions and Story Bridge Films' screen adaptation of David Walliams best-selling children's book FING!\nSecured through Screen Queensland's Production Attraction Strategy, the live action family film stars Academy Award winner Taika Waititi (Time Bandits, Our Flag Means Death), Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland), Blake Harrison (World on Fire), David Walliams (Little Britain), Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) and Richard Roxburgh (Elvis, Prosper), alongside newcomer Iona Bell.\nThe film is co-written by BAFTA award winner Walliams and Emmy award winner Kevin Celil (Veep), with Queensland's multi-award-winning director Jeffrey Walker (Apple Cider Vinegar, The Portable Door) at the helm.\nFING! is an official Australian/UK co-production led by Jo Sargent from London-based King Bert Productions and Todd Fellman from Queensland's Story Bridge Films.\nArts Minister John-Paul Langbroek said that with the support of the Crisafulli Government, 2025 is shaping up to be a bumper year for screen production in Queensland.\n\"David Walliams' FING! is beloved by children around the world, and it's incredible to see our Production Attraction Strategy supporting renowned Queensland creatives as they bring it to life on the big screen.\n\"FING! joins recent blockbuster announcements including Voltron, Anaconda and Bluey, which really demonstrates Queensland's growing reputation as a global film and animation powerhouse.\n\"This film will showcase the skills of our local screen practitioners to an international audience, while contributing about $16 million into the state's economy and employing more than 300 Queenslanders during production.\"\nScreen Queensland CEO Jacqui Feeney said that FING! is another example of Brisbane's Story Bridge Films success with international co-productions, such as 2023's The Portable Door with The Jim Henson Company.\n\"Global partnerships via co-productions are an increasingly vital factor for film and series financing, and we are so pleased to be supporting King Bert Productions and Story Bridge Films to make FING! in Queensland.\n\"As well as access to our talented local artisans and designers, the shoot will benefit from the flexibility of Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane and its proximity to versatile filming locations.\"\nFING! follows Myrtle Meek (Iona Bell), a spoiled child who demands a \"FING\" despite having everything she could wish for. Her parents (Mia Wasikowska and Blake Harrison) embark on a quest to track one down, taking them to the furthest and darkest corners of the jungle. FING turns out to be as much as a destructive monster as Myrtle, who in turn, must battle it out with the evil animal park owner, The Viscount (Taika Waititi), who is determined to own this rarest of creatures.\nThe film joins a strong slate of Queensland-made productions including Voltron, Anaconda, Spa Weekend and the feature film debut of Brisbane's own Bluey. Recent releases include Black Snow (Season 2), Good Cop/Bad Cop, Nautilus, How to Make Gravy, The Lost Tiger and Spit, while Deadloch (Season 2) wrapped production at Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane in December.\nEmmy Award-winning producer of FING!, Jo Sargent (Absolutely Fabulous, Malory Towers) said that \"David and I have always known FING! had potential to be an incredibly cinematic story.\n\"Director Jeffrey Walker and co-producer Todd Fellman have shared our vision from day one and it's been wonderful to work alongside their world class crew in Queensland as we create the creature and story we know and love.\"\nStory Bridge Films' Todd Fellman adds, \"The support and infrastructure provided by Screen Queensland has been instrumental in making this film a reality. As a local, it's wonderful to continue to produce large scale feature films in my back yard.\n\"We're shooting at Screen Queensland's Brisbane studios and the facilities are incredible. This combined with the talent of our local crew, provides the perfect platform to create a film of international scale and quality.\"\nStan's Chief Content Officer, Cailah Scobie said that \"Following the success of the Stan Original film, The Portable Door, we are thrilled to reunite with Sky, Jeffrey Walker and Story Bridge Films, along with new partners, King Bert Productions and AGC Studios, to bring David's incredible vision to life.\n\"We were instantly captivated by FING!'s charm and originality. It's a film with universal appeal and we are confident it will resonate with Australian audiences of all ages. We're delighted to be part of the global release.\"\nFING! is an official Australian/UK co-production led by Jo Sargent from London-based King Bert Productions and Todd Fellman from Queensland's Story Bridge Films, with AGC Studios co-financing and handling worldwide sales and distribution. Transmission Films will release theatrically in Australia and New Zealand with Stan premiering as a Stan Original on SVOD. Sky is co-financing and has developed the project in the UK and will premiere the film as a Sky Original on Sky Cinema. Executive producers are David Walliams and Shana Levine together with Andrew Orr for Sky, Cailah Scobie and Alicia Brown for Stan, and Stuart Ford, Miguel Palos, and Aghi Koh for AGC Studios with financing provided by Elevate Media Capital.
