    "text": "TOPSFIELD — Two people were seriously injured in a highway car crash that occurred Christmas Day on I-95 in Topsfield. Topsfield Fire/EMS were dispatched to I-95 southbound just after 6 p.m. on Monday, after the North Shore Regional 911 Center received several reports of a serious motor vehicle crash with at least one individual ejected from a car, according to a press release from the Topsfield Fire Department. The crash seriously injured one individual who was in the median when emergency services arrived, and potentially seriously injured another. While no other drivers were injured, several other vehicles received damage as a result of the crash. While directing incoming units, Lt. John Boyle, as well as Firefighter/EMT Matt Enos, treated the more seriously injured individual and prepared them for transport, as they realized time was of the essence, the press release said. Both patients were transported to local hospitals. Their condition is unknown at this time. Due to it being a holiday and the initial response being a solo unit, one engine was requested from the Boxford Fire Department, and a mutual aid ambulance was requested from Northeast Regional Ambulance, authorities said. Off-duty Topsfield firefighters at home finishing holiday festivities also responded with another engine to assist at the scene. MedFlight was notified but was unable to respond to the scene due to low ceiling height from cloud/fog cover. “As always we are grateful for our members and mutual aid partners’ work at these serious incidents and continue to keep the affected parties in our thoughts hoping for a positive outcome,” fire Chief Jen Collins-Brown said in a press release. The crash remains under investigation by Massachusetts State Police.",

    "text": "A corrida entre Júpiter e Saturno pelo maior número de luas do Sistema Solar pode ter acabado finalmente. A descoberta é incrível!\nNão uma, não duas, mas 128 luas à volta de Júpiter Uma equipa de cientistas encontrou 128 luas desconhecidas à volta de Saturno , numa descoberta oficialmente reconhecida pela União Astronómica Internacional .\nIsto eleva o número total de luas conhecidas do planeta para 274 , deixando Júpiter, com as suas meras 95 luas, na poeira.\nO primeiro indício de que havia mais luas à espera de serem descobertas surgiu entre 2019 e 2021, quando foram identificados 62 desses objetos .\nNessa altura, foram também detetados outros pequenos objetos que ainda não podiam ser designados.\nCom o conhecimento de que estas eram provavelmente luas, e que provavelmente havia ainda mais à espera de serem descobertas, revisitámos os mesmos campos do céu durante três meses consecutivos em 2023.\nDisse o astrónomo Edward Ashton da Academia Sincia em Taiwan.\nCom toda a certeza, encontrámos 128 novas luas. Com base nas nossas projeções, penso que Júpiter nunca irá recuperar o atraso.\nAcrescentou o astrónomo.\nEstas luas, para sermos claros, não são como a Lua da Terra , bonita, grande e agradavelmente esférica.\nSão luas minúsculas, todas inchadas e em forma de batata, com apenas alguns quilómetros de diâmetro - aquilo a que se chama luas irregulares.\nOs investigadores acreditam que, no início da história do Sistema Solar, elas constituíam originalmente um pequeno grupo de objetos capturados pela gravidade na órbita de Saturno.\nUma série de colisões subsequentes tê-los-ia esmagado em pedaços de lua , resultando na preponderância de pequenas rochas que os astrónomos encontraram.\nDe facto, acreditam que uma colisão deve ter ocorrido há apenas 100 milhões de anos , o que é um piscar de olhos muito curto para um planeta. A localização das luas, também, dentro do grupo nórdico das luas de Saturno, sugere que foi neste local que ocorreu a recente colisão.\nO grupo Nórdico é constituído por luas que orbitam em direção retrógrada , em ângulos inclinados e em trajetórias elípticas, fora dos anéis de Saturno. Tal como as luas recém-descobertas, também elas são relativamente pequenas.\nBatatas. Anéis. Parecem familiares, de alguma forma...\nUm grupo de 64 luas foi descrito em pormenor num novo artigo submetido ao Planetary Science Journal.\nO preprint está disponível no arXiv .",
