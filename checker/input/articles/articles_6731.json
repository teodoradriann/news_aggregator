    "text": "New Zealand&#039;s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon attends a meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of Heads of State and Government, Indo-Pacific and European Union during NATO&#039;s 75th anniversary summit in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2024. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz By Lucy Craymer (Reuters) - New Zealand&#039;s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Thursday that his country needed to stand up for the international rules-based order as potential military flashpoints loom in the Indo-Pacific region. &quot;We need to stand up for this international rules based system that has actually served New Zealand incredibly well... When it is under threat, and you&#039;ve actually got to call it out, and you&#039;ve got to stand up and make your contribution,&quot; Luxon told media after two days of meetings at the NATO summit in Washington. While not a member of the NATO alliance, New Zealand is part of a group of countries referred to as the Indo-Pacific Four(IP-4), which also includes Japan, South Korea and Australia. The IP-4 held sessions with NATO and EU leaders, while Luxon had bilateral meetings with a number of leaders including from Canada, France and Spain. Luxon said in a statement after he chaired the IP-4 meeting that it made sense for four of the most advanced democracies in the region to work together to support international stability. New Zealand is &quot;making sure that we are going to be a trusted good partner to them to our friends and allies,&quot; Luxon later told reporters. New Zealand on Friday announced it would extend its contribution to the U.S.-led coalitions operating in the Red Sea. Luxon also warned a situation like Russia&#039;s invasion of Ukraine had the potential to occur in East Asia. &quot;When you think about the situations we have with North Korea firing missiles over Korean and Japanese airspace, when you think about the challenges in the Second Thomas Shoal reef with respect to the Philippines, and the behavior that we saw from China there, when you think about Taiwan, you know, we have potential flashpoints in our region,&quot; Luxon said. New Zealand this week announced a further NZ$16 million ($9.74 million) in support for Ukraine and further sanctions against seven individuals and 12 entities providing military assistance to Russia. ($1 = 1.6434 New Zealand dollars) (Reporting by Lucy Craymer in Wellington; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

Having begun her journey as a Manipur-cadre IPS officer, Singh's story to the top level of the CISF is a testament to her dedication.\nIn a historic moment, Nina Singh, a 1989-batch IPS officer from the Rajasthan cadre, was elevated to the post of Director General of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Singh will be the first woman to lead this crucial central paramilitary force.\nHaving begun her journey as a Manipur-cadre IPS officer, Singh's story to the top level of the CISF is a testament to her dedication.\nOriginally from Bihar, she pursued her education at the Patna Women's College and Jawaharlal Nehru University. She later pursued a Master's degree in Public Administration from Harvard University.\nShe has also co-authored research papers with Nobel laureates Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, according to NDTV.\nHer visionary leadership during her tenure as Joint Director of CBI (2013-2018) saw her overseeing high-profile cases such as the Sheena Bora murder and Jiah Khan suicide.\nIn 2000, she came up with an innovative outreach program as the member secretary for the State Women's Commission, providing a platform for women in distress. Under it, members would go to districts to hold hearings for women in distress.\nHer husband, Rohit Kumar Singh, an Indian Administrative Service officer, currently serves as the Secretary of the Union consumer affairs ministry.\nNina Singh's appointment as the Director General of CISF not only marks a milestone for her but also paves the way for aspiring women in the field of law enforcement. Her spirit serves as an inspiration for the generations to come, which would help break the barriers that are meant to be broken.",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEdición\nEl stand de Granada acoge estos días una actividad continua en la Feria Internacional de Turismo en Madrid. Con el foco puesto en las pernoctaciones de los visitantes, la consolidación de la agenda cultural de Granada y de su imagen como destino de fin de ... semana, la alcaldesa de la capital, Marifrán Carazo, recibe a IDEAL en el pabellón número cinco de Fitur para valorar el paso por la feria y los principales objetivos en el sector turístico.\n–¿Cómo vive Granada su paso por Fitur?\n–Hemos trasladado la mejor imagen de la ciudad y de la provincia. La misión que teníamos era fortalecer la presencia de Granada en el ámbito nacional. Hay que destacar la presencia institucional unida, eso fortalece la marca Granada. Nuestras presentaciones apoyan el binomio turismo-cultura para destacar estos aspectos y alcanzar un mayor turismo de calidad, que nos permita incrementar las pernoctaciones de los visitantes y el gasto de los visitantes. La cultura nos puede ayudar a alcanzar el objetivo de que Granada sea capital cultural en 2031. Esta ciudad es capaz de ofrecer más de 30 festivales de todo tipo de música, sumando este año la primera bienal de flamenco. Necesitamos conseguir una agenda única. Esta es una asignatura pendiente en la que trabajamos de la mano de los fondos europeos, con un proyecto de dos millones de euros que se ha aprobado ya.\n–¿En qué punto se encuentra el sector en la ciudad?\n–Está recuperado de la pandemia, principalmente el visitante nacional de fin de semana. Pero también es importante atraer a los visitantes internacionales asiáticos y norteamericanos, dos perfiles que nos interesan por el gasto que hacen en la ciudad. El turismo europeo es importante, pero también el procedente del continente asiático. También vamos a seguir trabajando con el turismo norteamericano, con una campaña de promoción de la mano del flamenco, la ciudad de Nueva York y la Cámara de Comercio. Apostamos por un turismo de calidad con el apoyo de todos los establecimientos. Valoramos el esfuerzo que hacen en mejorar y modernizarse.\n–¿Qué papel tiene el turismo de lujo en Granada?\n–En los últimos cinco años se ha despertado el turismo de lujo en Granada, esto contribuye al turismo de calidad que presentamos. Este turismo tiene que ser sostenible y convivir con el día a día de la ciudad. Estamos en un momento de planificación, de trabajar de la mano del sector y de la federación de hostelería, donde es evidente la implicación. Hay que ser consciente de la importancia que tiene el turismo y la creación de empleos.\n–¿Qué distingue a Granada de sus competidoras por la capitalidad cultural?\n–La presencia de la cultura a lo largo de su historia. Esto justifica el camino que estamos trazando, con una Granada que inspira, que atrae talento y que cuenta también con mucho talento en la industria creativa. Existe una diferencia en la que podemos crecer porque la capitalidad cultural debe ser un estímulo de transformación, hay que unificar toda la oferta que tenemos para generar así más oportunidades para Granada, empleo, impacto en nuestra economía. Buscamos turistas interesados en la cultura de Granada. Hemos conseguido ponernos de acuerdo y queremos avanzar como ciudad de música, de literatura. Hay que fortalecer la imagen de Granada cultural, comprometiéndonos con nuestros proyectos. El Ayuntamiento de Granada tiene el mayor presupuesto en materia de cultura de la última década, pero hay que sumar iniciativas privadas.\n–¿Ha habido contactos con turoperadoras y aerolíneas durante estos días?\n–Ha habido contactos, hay un trabajo técnico detrás de las presentaciones con comunicaciones que ya están establecidas y que se han mantenido a lo largo del tiempo para atraer a compañías y aerolíneas. Estamos trabajando de forma correcta a pesar de las dificultades. Lo estamos haciendo bien como para recuperar las conexiones que Granada ha tenido, conexiones internacionales y nacionales.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?
