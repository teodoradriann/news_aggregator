    "text": "PM Modi’s outreach to Vladimir Putin prevented ‘potential nuclear strike’ on Ukraine in 2022: Report\nThe role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in advocating for peace and de-escalation proved crucial in preventing a \"possible\" nuclear conflict amidst the Russia-Ukraine crisis in 2022.\nWashington: As tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated in 2022, the United States took measures to prepare for the possibility of a nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, CNN reported citing senior administration officials. According to the report, the Biden administration was deeply concerned that Russia might resort to using tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons.\nIn response, the US sought assistance from non-allied countries, including India, to dissuade Russia from such an attack. “One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, and encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” a senior administration official said.\nPM Modi’s significant role in averting Russia-Ukraine crisis\nIndia, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, played a significant role in averting the crisis. PM Modi’s outreach and public statements condemning civilian killings and advocating for a peaceful resolution to the conflict were instrumental in international efforts.\n“I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the senior administration official added.\nDuring the SCO summit in Uzbekistan, PM Modi said to President Vladimir Putin that “this is not the era of war,” a statement that resonated globally and even made it to the G20 communique under India’s presidency.\nWhat happened in 2022?\nIn late summer and fall 2022, as Russian forces faced setbacks in Ukraine, the National Security Council of the US convened meetings to develop contingency plans. Ukrainian advances on Russian-occupied territories raised concerns within the administration about potential triggers for a nuclear attack. Simultaneously, Russia allegedly circulated a “false flag story” about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, raising fears among US officials that it could be used as a pretext for a nuclear strike.\nDespite these tensions, the US never detected intelligence indicating Russia was mobilising its nuclear forces for an attack. “We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of the types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons,” he added.",

    "text": "L'utilisation du lévonorgestrel n'est pas associée à une augmentation du risque de méningiome intracrânien. En revanche, une augmentation très faible du risque a été identifiée chez les femmes de plus de 45 ans, lors de l'utilisation prolongée et en cours de contraceptifs à base de désogestrel seul dosé à 75µg. L'utilisation prolongée de pilules contraceptives contenant du désogestrel présente un risque de méningiome pour les femmes de plus de 45 ans, toutefois \"très faible\" comparé aux autres progestatifs, selon une étude du groupement d'intérêt scientifique Epi-Phare présentée ce jeudi 19 décembre.\nCette étude montre \"une augmentation très faible du risque pour les contraceptions à base de désogestrel seul, lors d'une utilisation prolongée et en cours chez les femmes de plus de 45 ans\", selon un communiqué publié par plusieurs institutions sanitaires.\n\"Ce risque augmente avec la durée d'utilisation: il apparaît à partir de 5 ans d'utilisation et est multiplié par 2 au-delà de 7 ans d'exposition\", précisent l'Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament, Epi-Phare et la Cnam.\nCes progestatifs sont commercialisés sous les noms d'Optimizette, Cérazette, Antigone, Lactinette, Elfasette, Clareal, Desopop et sous des versions génériques.\nLe risque est jugé \"très faible\" Pour 67.000 femmes utilisatrices du désogestrel quelle que soit la durée d'exposition, l'étude observe un cas de méningiome opéré et \"un cas pour 17.000 femmes exposées plus de 5 ans\".\nLe risque est jugé \"très faible\" comparé à celui observé pour six progestatifs déjà connus pour être à risque de méningiome\" (Androcur, Lutéran, Lutényl, Colprone, Depo Provera et Surgestone qui n'est plus commercialisé en France).\nConcrètement, il est par exemple de \"100 fois inférieur\" au risque lié au fait d'avoir pris du Lutéran pendant plus de 5 ans, a souligné Alain Weill, directeur adjoint d'Epi-Phare.\nAucun risque de méningiome n'a été observé en cas de durée d'utilisation de moins d'un an du désogestrel, sauf lors d'une utilisation antérieure d'autres progestatifs à risque. Et en cas d'arrêt depuis plus d'un an, le sur-risque de méningiome disparait.\nPas de hausse du risque avec le lévonorgestrel Plus rassurant encore, l'utilisation du lévonorgestrel, seul ou combiné à l'éthinylestradiol, \"n'est pas associée à une augmentation du risque de méningiome intracrânien, quelles que soient les durées d'exposition\", ajoute l'étude.\nCette étude est la première au niveau national à évaluer le risque de méningiome associé à la prise de contraceptifs oraux contenant du désogestrel et du lévonorgestrel, très utilisés en France avec plus de 3,6 millions de femmes concernées en janvier 2022.\nAu total 8.391 femmes opérées d'un méningiome intracrânien entre 2020 et 2023 en France ont été incluses dans l'étude.\nSur le même sujet Une étude montre un risque augmenté de tumeurs lié à trois médicaments progestatifs En attendant d'annoncer, début 2025, des mesures permettant de réduire le risque de méningiome lié à l'utilisation du désogestrel, l'ANSM rappelle que \"le désogestrel n'est pas un traitement hormonal de la ménopause\" et \"qu'après la ménopause, une contraception ne doit plus être prescrite\".\nS.R. avec AFP Les plus lus\nProcès des viols de Mazan: Dominique Pelicot condamné à 20 ans de réclusion criminelle, la peine maximale",

The money belongs to them, and if they survive the entire season, each contestant will be able to claim an even share.\nUnlike the average game show, the contestants’ fates are entirely dependent on each other, facing the dilemma of sharing the prize equally or strategically voting each other out.
