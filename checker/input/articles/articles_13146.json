    "title": "Islamic Community in BiH: “We are disturbed by Announcements of Secession” - Sarajevo Times",
    "text": "The Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina announced that its members, as well as the majority of citizens of BiH, are deeply disturbed by the latest statements of Milorad Dodik, who, as they state, admitted that he has ready plans for the secession of part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that he is just waiting for any reason for it. They state that the public is no less worried about the announcements of the disempowerment of the state and the confiscation of its property, which, along with putting the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina under political control, would be an essential act of secession. The Islamic community welcomed the resolute position of the administration of the United States of America (USA), especially those expressed in the statement of the US Embassy in Sarajevo and the speech of the US Assistant Secretary of State and Head of the Office for Europe and Eurasia James O’Brien. ”With its clear position that the USA will act if someone tries to change the basic element of Dayton and violate the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States of America proves that it is a sincere friend of this country and someone who is aware of the importance of the hard-won peace in this part of Europe,” it is said in the statement of the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Islamic community called on domestic politicians to take responsibility for the new situation and prepare a response to any attempt to undermine peace, the Dayton Agreement and the territorial integrity of the country. “This is, first of all, the obligation of domestic politicians and state institutions, and only then of our friends in the world. Other international actors, especially the European Union and its members, are also expected to take these threats to stability seriously and not to minimize them, but to clearly express their determination to stop dangerous and irresponsible policies and their holders, and to put an end to them. give in, please and thus encourage them to continue with the dangerous adventure that is dictated from who knows which power centers,” it was stated in the statement.",

    "text": "British medic who died in Ukraine ‘devoted her life to helping others’ Katherine Mielniczuk, 26, spent much of the last two years volunteering on the frontline after graduating from university. A British woman who died as a combat medic in Ukraine “devoted her life to helping others”, her family said. Katherine Mielniczuk went to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, compelled to use her medical skills to help those in need. The 26-year-old, who graduated in chemistry at the University of Bristol, spent almost two years risking her life to provide medical supplies and emergency care to injured Ukrainian and foreign fighters, travelling to the most volatile stretches of the frontline and earning herself the nickname “Apache”. She died in the early hours of Christmas Eve in eastern Ukraine, her family said on Friday. Ms Mielniczuk was an “inspiration in resilience and grace” and the “kindest and most selfless person one could hope to meet”, her family said. An online fundraiser has so far garnered almost £3,000 of £10,000 to repatriate Ms Mielniczuk, also known as Kasia, to the UK. Her family said: “It is impossible to truly convey what an incredible woman Katherine was or how deeply and widely she was loved and will be missed. “Kasia is gone, but the endless warmth, love and grace she brought to the world will never be lost”. She wrote: “The mental, physical, financial consequences of war are catastrophic and a kind word can hold tremendous power for us when we are losing hope and seeing tragedies daily. “We prioritise fighting for a free Ukraine, for a prosperous and fruitful future for Ukrainian children.” To support repatriation and funeral costs for Ms Mielniczuk, visit: https://donorbox.org/katherine-mielniczuk",

    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee lawmakers have approved the state's budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, planning to spend around $7 billion more than the previous year. The latest spending plan comes in at around $59.8 billion.\nLawmakers said the spending plan recognizes a 2% growth rate and shifts around $19.94 million in funds originally slated to be recurring to be nonrecurring, giving the state more leverage to manage or cut some long-term spending.\nA release from lawmakers said the\nstate budget would create a $42.5 million nonrecurring grant pool aimed at supporting community services. That pool has $20 million in funding for volunteer fire departments, $5 million for rescue squads and $5 million for emergency medical services. Funding is also available for senior centers, museums and courthouse restorations.\nThe pool also sets aside $500,000 for the Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee, which said in late March that federal departments had\ncanceled 21 tractor-trailers of food, valued at around $722,200.\nThe budget also provides $26 million in nonrecurring funds for survivors of Hurricane Helene, and $20 million set aside for a match to federal disaster relief efforts.\nIt also sets aside $145.9 million to\nfund universal school vouchers, a controversial proposal that was passed during a special legislative session earlier in the year. The program allows families to apply for vouchers of more than $7,000 in public funds to be spent on private school costs. Critics of the program said it moves funds away from already underfunded public schools.\nA release from lawmakers also said the budget sets aside $62.7 million for primary and secondary school infrastructure, as well as an extra $244 million for public school funding through the state's Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement formula.\nThe budget sets aside $500,000 in one-time funds for the University of Tennessee Law Enforcement Innovation Center, and $400,000 for the East Tennessee Regional Forensic Facility and Training Program.\nThe University of Tennessee System's campuses are expected to get around $930 million from the state, and more than a third of those funds will go towards its Knoxville campus. Around another $11.3 million will go to the UT Space Institute, and $5.8 million will go towards the university system's research initiatives. The school's veterinary medicine program will get around $35.7 million, and its agricultural extension service is expected to receive around $53.1 million.\nThe Tennessee Department of Health is slated to get around $368 million, and its Department of Human Services is set to get around $307.4 million. The Tennessee Department of Military will get around $42.1 million, and the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services will get around $436.5 million.\nThe spending plan also moves $35.6 million into the state's \"Rainy Day Fund,\" bringing that fund to nearly $2.2 billion in total and making it the largest in state history, according to the release.\nAhead of the vote, Democratic lawmakers asked the state's Department of Finance about how Tennessee could be impacted by federal cuts, saying that federal funds made up about 41.9% of the previous year's budget. Lawmakers said they wanted to understand the scope that federal cuts could have, so families would not \"bear the burden of federal instability.\"\nInformation about the extent of federal funding in this year's budget proposal was not immediately available.",

    "text": "PALO ALTO, CA—Torben Ostergaard, CEO di Spinnaker, una sussidiaria di Hippo Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HIPO), ha recentemente venduto azioni ordinarie della società, secondo un documento depositato presso la Securities and Exchange Commission. Le transazioni, eseguite il 17.12.2024, hanno comportato la vendita di 2.092 azioni, per un valore totale di circa $55.359. Secondo i dati di InvestingPro , il titolo della società ha mostrato un notevole slancio con un rendimento del 185% nell'ultimo anno, nonostante la recente volatilità.\nLe vendite sono state condotte nell'ambito di un piano di trading Rule 10b5-1 prestabilito, datato 17.09.2024. Le azioni sono state vendute a prezzi compresi tra $26,4256 e $27,2 per azione. In seguito a queste transazioni, Ostergaard mantiene la proprietà diretta di 104.332 azioni, incluse 54.835 restricted stock units (RSU). La società ha dimostrato una forte crescita dei ricavi, con un aumento dell'85% negli ultimi dodici mesi.\nHippo Holdings Inc., con sede a Palo Alto, è una società specializzata in assicurazioni contro incendi, marittime e danni. Le vendite riflettono parte della gestione in corso da parte di Ostergaard del suo investimento nella società. L'analisi di InvestingPro indica che il titolo è attualmente sottovalutato, con gli analisti che prevedono una continua crescita delle vendite. Gli abbonati possono accedere al completo Rapporto di Ricerca Pro per approfondimenti sulla salute finanziaria e le prospettive di crescita di Hippo.\nIn altre notizie recenti, Hippo Holdings Inc. ha riportato una serie di sviluppi significativi. La società ha annunciato una robusta crescita del premio totale generato e dei ricavi per il secondo trimestre del 2024. Questa traiettoria positiva è attribuita a iniziative strategiche che hanno aumentato il valore del ciclo di vita del cliente, ridotto i costi di acquisizione e diminuito significativamente le perdite legate alle condizioni meteorologiche.\nHippo ha anche annunciato cambiamenti nella sua leadership esecutiva. La società ha nominato Andrea Collins come Chief Marketing Officer e William Malone, un professionista esperto con 25 anni di esperienza nel settore assicurativo, come Vice President, Head of Agency. Contemporaneamente, Yuval Harry, il Chief Revenue Officer, è passato dal suo ruolo esecutivo a una posizione consultiva.\nInoltre, i warrant di Hippo sono stati delistati dalla Borsa di New York a causa dei prezzi di vendita persistentemente bassi, ma questa decisione non influisce sulle azioni ordinarie della società, che rimangono quotate.

    "text": "SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Thursday, thousands of dollars were awarded to eight local non-profits for all of their work with helping the youth in Siouxland. Every year, Women United, pool together money and put it all toward helping local non-profits who have a focus of supporting children in the community. This year, they were able to give out $92,450, marking it their second-largest year to date. This year they were able to award grants to: Sleep in Heavenly Peace - $25,000 The Warming Shelter - $7,200 Mary J. Treglia Community House Preschool - $4,998 Big Brothers Big Sisters - $18,000 Girls Scouts of Greater Iowa - $6,950 Heartland Counseling - $25,550 Haven House Family Services Center - $2,256 Siouxland Mental Health Center - $2,496 “These agencies have come together, they have done so much for Siouxland Children. They are also doing so much for the community because they are investing their time and effort and their expertise in improving the community. It’s a great feeling,” said Cathy Perley, Chair of Women United. One of those non-profits, Sleep in Heavenly Peace, was awarded $25,000. With that money, they will be able to buy supplies for building the beds and maintaining their warehouse. “It’s a game changer, really, because the consistent support lasts throughout the year right, the consistent support we get through this will just mean a lot to the organization, our volunteers, the kids who are getting the beds, the families who are getting the beds,” said Elise Morris, a Core Team Member of Sleep in Heavenly Peace. With Thursday’s donation, the Women United has awarded over $1.3 million since 2006. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Météo du samedi 14 décembre : gris, humide et froid presque partout\nC'est la fête aux nuages pour cet avant-dernier week-end précédant la fête de Noël. Dans un flux général orienté au nord-ouest, de l'air humide et très frais circule sur la France. Seul le Languedoc-Roussillon et la Provence retrouvent de belles éclaircies après les pluies de la veille.\nFait marquants :\n- de faibles chutes de neige se produisent dès 700 m sur le Jura, 900 m sur les Alpes du Nord\n- encore beaucoup de grisaille sur les 3/4 du pays avec localement des bancs de brouillard\n- de l'instabilité en Corse avec un risque d'averses qui persiste\nMatin\nLes nuages dominent sur la majeure partie du pays et s'accompagnent parfois d'un peu de pluie, notamment près de la Manche mais aussi du sud-ouest au centre-est avec un peu de neige dès 700 à 900 m sur le Massif central et les Alpes du Nord. En méditerranée, une amélioration se dessine en Languedoc-Roussillon avec le retour de belles éclaircies. Tramontane et mistral y soufflent modérément. Le temps reste instable en direction de la Corse avec un risque d'averse orageuse.\nLes températures sont comprises entre -2°C à Charleville-Mézières et 11°C à Ajaccio.\nAprès-Midi\nLe ciel reste bas et gris des Pyrénées au nord-est et au centre-est, mais les précipitations sont de plus en plus rares. Dans le nord-ouest, les nuages conservent l'avantage mais quelques éclaircies tentent de percer par endroits. Le risque d'averses est encore présent près de la Manche. En Méditerranée, de belles éclaircies gagnent la région PACA alors que des averses continuent de circuler sur la Corse.\nLes températures sont comprises entre 2°C dans les Ardennes à 14°C en Corse.\nSoirée\nTemps calme et sec sur une large moitié nord avec un ciel très nuageux à couvert. Temps plus humide des Pyrénées au Massif central avec des pluies éparses. Ciel plus dégagé dans le sud-est, excepté en Corse où l'instabilité persiste avec nuages et averses.\nLes températures sont comprises entre 2°C à Troyes et 11°C à Ajaccio.\nEvolution ultérieure\nDimanche et lundi, l'anticyclone viendra s'installer sur la France même mais comme souvent à cette période de l'année, l'humidité sera importante dans les basses couches de l'atmosphère, ce qui se traduira par de nombreux brouillards et nuages bas. Il faudra aller en montagne ou dans le sud-est pour trouver le soleil.",
