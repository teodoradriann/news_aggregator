    "text": "According to a release, Longleaf Recovery & Wellness, a primary mental health outpatient facility in Hoover, officially opened on Tuesday, April 2, with a ribbon-cutting and open house. The event featured Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kim Boswell and Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato. “It is such a privilege to partner with this group to expand and increase access to care in Alabama,” said Commissioner Boswell. “It is so important for programs like (this) to expand and provide the missing gaps in the continuum of care. This program will be instrumental in serving a need…that is not really currently available in our state.” “[People] need facilities like this where they can come in, have an opportunity to recover and to enjoy the quality of life that God intended for them to have,” Mayor Brocato said. Chief Executive Officer Colin Harris said it is “abundantly clear there is a tremendous need for more accessible, high-quality options for both substance use treatment and comprehensive mental health treatment in Alabama.” The mission of Longleaf, a partnership between Birmingham Recovery Center, LIV Development and EBSCO Industries, is to bring more treatment options to Alabamians through strategic expansion. The company’s Huntsville-area location will open in late April, with plans for a Baldwin County facility to open mid-summer.

    "title": "Amid Gaza war, IDF medics still save lives in the West Bank",
    "text": "An IDF helicopter is seen transporting injured people for further care in the West Bank.\nA car had flipped, and there were two injured persons from the accident.\nThere was insufficient time for Magen David Adom to get to the scene before one of the injured would have died.\nThe IDF’s West Bank medical corps sprang into action, and two very young non-doctors, one a paramedic and one with more basic IDF medical training, saved the person’s life. They stabilized him until MDA was able to send a helicopter to take him to a hospital.\nIDF Central Command Chief Medical Officer Col. Avi Shina was very proud of the two young medical personnel.\nIn an interview with the Magazine, he said that he has under his command “hundreds of health personnel… There are doctors coming out of the Atuda program, which mixes university degrees in medicine, law, and others areas with army service.”\nON THE scene of a Ma’aleh Adumim terror attack, Aug. 1. (credit: Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nON THE scene of a Ma’aleh Adumim terror attack, Aug. 1. (credit: Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nOnly a few months ago, the IDF West Bank Medical Command was considered the hottest and most intense front for gaining complex medical battle experience and making the biggest difference as part of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe West Bank: Israel’s forgotten front grows only more intense Since October 7, the Gaza front now overshadows all other fronts in terms of casualties.\nBut the West Bank has not quieted down at all and, in fact, has gotten more intense for the last three months – with regular raids against terrorists, including 2,400 security arrests.\nRegarding IDF medical staff experience, Shina said that at the Hebrew University, his future IDF doctors “learn medicine like everyone but also get special skills from the military. We also specially train nurses.\n“You are often an extension of a battle unit, to be close by to be able to quickly attend to wounded persons.”\nShina noted that even before the current war, earlier in 2023, due to the waves of West Bank terrorism, “there was an increase in IDF dentists, therapists, and paramedics. An increase in these positions is relatively new in the IDF Medical Command, and many of them are younger, but they are good men and women who get trained to carry out specific skills for emergencies.\n“We work with forces in the field, special forces, also ambulances for emergency care. We have seven ambulances spread through Central Command. We attend to IDF soldiers but also to Israeli civilians and Palestinians,” he explained.\nHis area of authority includes the Jordan Valley, and each brigade in the West Bank has medical personnel. His IDF teams also work with the Red Cross, which has dozens of staff in the area.\nReferring to the flipped car incident, which occurred some time ago in the Jordan Valley, Shina recounted that one important aspect of what helped the emergency medical first responders to handle the situation, until MDA was able to send a helicopter to transport the patient to the hospital, was a new “whole blood” pilot program.\nWhole blood consists of a single donor’s red blood cells, plasma, and platelets; it is frequently used for emergency transfusions and massive transfusions.\n“We were one of the first that included them [whole blood supplies] in standard ground transportation units. They used to have them only for helicopters,” Shina said, noting that back in the spring, whole blood was only available to the Central Command (since then, its use has been expanded to other fronts).\nAt the time, Central Command was getting preference on certain issues over other fronts because the main ongoing threat to Israel then was the waves of terrorism emanating from the West Bank.\nAs to the new blood transfusions, “We have two blood transfusion products – one is plasma, and one is whole blood. Our ambulances have been very involved with the Operation Break the Wave nightly raids in the West Bank. We have been a leader in plasma.”\nValuable tool Whole blood can be transfused into patients of any blood type, making it a valuable tool for militaries, which often need to transfuse blood in difficult environments where strategic blood typing and matching up is not always possible.\nUS studies had already shown that such whole blood was safe and effective in military settings, especially during combat operations. Support for using whole blood included a study of soldiers who received it during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a finding that the risk of transfusion reactions was significantly lower than those in soldiers who had been given blood from the more traditional blood banks.\nIn the first few months that this new whole blood was rolled out, Shina said, “more than 1,000 people have been treated, and as many as a few thousand. It is a front with high volume.” There are many health accidents, where IDF personnel or residents get injured.\nAddressing the diverse set of patients his IDF teams treat, he explained that even during times of intense conflict, “we have multiple health services which treat Israeli civilians and Palestinians together. The police and the fire department are also often both involved.”\nAsked whether the IDF medical officers have been taught Arabic to work better with the Palestinian patients they deal with, he responded, “We need to do more in this area and regarding their culture. In the Jordan Valley, there are significant medical issues. The doctor in charge happens to speak Arabic. This helps a lot and we try to be aware, but we should be doing more. Language can be a significant barrier” to providing full medical care for wounded Palestinians.\nIn answer to whether his medical group was given more staff over the course of Break the Wave since March 2022, Shina said, “Yes, we got more staff. We do a situational assessment. Where do we need more resources and what is the best way to increase our activities? We know how to increase our staff. And the volume of blood [for treatment has been] improved.\n“The West Bank ambulances got the first whole blood because we had so many wounded and more regular violent friction” with an adversary.\nRegarding the evolution of his medical staff’s role since the outbreak of the current Gaza war: “With the outbreak of Operation Swords of Iron, the Central Command’s medical branch broadened its deployment to provide the best medical responses and to provide security to the citizenry who live and work in the area.\n“We took on reservist doctors, medics, paramedics, and mental health officers who are equipped and trained to provide lifesaving treatment.\n“We also deepened cooperation with MDA and have been taking advantage of the benefits of relations with all organizations for the benefit of citizens and those serving in this command.”\nIn another specific incident he described, “We had cooperation with settlers and MDA. MDA was not available fast enough. A Jewish civilian had a heart attack. The paramedic was young but skilled. She saved his life. She had a solid understanding. She did a quick diagnosis, she used an EKG. She quickly gave him the appropriate short-term emergency care needed to tide him over to get him to the hospital.”\nRegarding the many injured people his team handles from car accidents, he noted an accident at the Ziv Junction. “There were a bunch of injured Palestinians, some whose lives were in danger. The paramedics understood the danger but are not authorized to perform blood transfers on their own authority; they need approval from a doctor.\n“In this case, they consulted with a doctor by cellphone, who approved the blood transfer,” he recounted.\nHe said the doctor’s immediate availability to collect the critical details needed to make a decision by cellphone was also key in this case in saving that life.\n“Medicine is a kind of bridge between people, and we are happy to serve as that bridge.”\nN. HAS served on one of Shina’s many medical teams in the West Bank. She discussed how there are different medical teams at the brigade and battalion levels, covering different areas and with different responsibilities.\nShe said she received a large number of calls for assistance, ranging from injured civilians to wounded soldiers.\n“We deal with car accidents, emergencies, terrorist attacks – more now than during earlier time periods.”\nRegarding saving the life of the man with the heart attack mentioned by Shina, N said, “We got a very substantial thank you from the patient and his family.”\nN said she had dealt with patients and chaotic scenes from terrorist attacks.\nIn terms of handling high-stress situations, she noted that in her first month, there was an incident where a civilian approached their base gate with a medical situation, but N stayed calm, “managed the incident and knew what to do.”\n“Only afterward did I understand the significance of the event, and then I understood the broader significance of my role for the brigade,” she commented.\nAs far as the whole blood program, N said it was “a pilot program which is special to the IDF. They do not have this in MDA or other civilian bodies. It is only in Judea and Samaria.”\nImmediately after receiving the new whole blood capabilities, “the next day it was already being used. The healing power was incredible and exponentially increased” the IDF’s lifesaving capabilities.\nN originally was placed in the Intelligence Corps for one year. “Then I was offered to be an officer in the Medical Corps. I was at the officers’ course for three months, and then had additional supplementary courses relating to health issues.”\nShe added, “Sometimes there are even Palestinian attacks against other Palestinians. For these, we used the whole blood two more times.”\nRegarding small Palestinian villages, N stated, “They have no medical infrastructure, no health center, no ambulances. A few times every week we go to provide care to Palestinians or if they approach the gate of one of our bases asking for medical help.\n“Our outlook is based on health. This is a profession, and we do our job, giving the best possible care. We don’t know the race of people in a car accident when we go to help.”\nIn one incident, N recounted, “a baby had swallowed something bad. Or it could be very complex, like two kids were run over by a car near a village. We got them substantial care, and then got them on a helicopter to a hospital.\n“You get to see the fruits of your labor of helping in real time. You often get a profound thank you. There is no ongoing relationship afterward, but it is a special moment of connecting.”\nA. IS 19, from Rishon Lezion, and is a medic – not a paramedic. “Even before the IDF, I was ready to push hard for this. I had already volunteered for MDA and wanted to continue with a path in medicine.\n“I knew I wanted Judea and Samaria. I have friends who are medics. It ranges from everything from Tylenol to more serious and complex issues,” she said.\nAccording to A, officer I trained her once she joined his ambulance team, including teaching some things beyond the standard curriculum.\n“I had not seen so many things like the full variety of real-world medical crises,” A recalled.\n“What I saw when volunteering with MDA was not as bad. This was complete chaos. I was concerned I might even lose control, but I stayed focused and provided the necessary medical treatment.”\nLater, A was asked about other assignments by the IDF which would not involve as much going out into the field with an ambulance team. But “I want to be out in the field and not stuck behind a desk. Everything we do here really matters. Anyone who needs it gets emergency care.”\nI. IS 21, from Tel Aviv. He said, “I took the IDF course to be a paramedic. I served in a few different units, then got to the Hebron-Judea area.\n“I tried other IDF medical sector areas but connected most with the people and work in this one. I also want to try out medicine after the IDF. I have no problem with blood.\n“We work cooperatively on car accidents, sometimes even with a flipped car,” he said.\nIn that incident, “Two people were hurt; one only moderately, with no urgency, but one more seriously, with high urgency. The two of us dealt with it. The medical care for the situation was well known. The key was whole blood. It is a new trend in the IDF, as well as in Israel more broadly. It’s super and crazy effective and fantastic to get such cutting-edge methods that can save someone’s life,” who might have been lost before the new method.\n“I was always very interested in medical care and the profession,” he stated. “When the incident happened, I was already deeper into my service. I had seen many situations before and knew what to do.\n“The West Bank medical sector is very real,” he continued. “We have the urgent care center, teaching, and care for commandos for all the fronts in the area. We are here for anyone. If someone wants serious medical work, the West Bank sector is the place.”\nI served there for close to two years.\n“We give care. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Palestinians or Israelis, tourists, women, children, car accidents” or fighting.\n“I definitely learned more health-related Arabic health words; I know how to ask about a person’s health in Arabic. This is part of our concept. We also need to give access to populations that are different from us. This becomes super interesting,” he said.\nShina concluded, вЂњWe are in the business of saving lives. There are universal values. Everyone gets treated. We have places where Jordan Valley Palestinian residents appeal straight to us. When we can, we try to do it, and with sensitivityвЂќ to the broader political and cultural complexities. в–",

    "text": "Ni los semáforos resistieron La VERDAD detrás del semáforo derretido en Monterrey; ¿fue por el calor? En redes sociales se difundieron fotografías de un semáforo que cayó rendido ante el fuerte calor en Monterrey, pero ¿qué hay detrás de esta curiosa fotografía? Te contamos El calor en el país no da tregua, y las [altas temperaturas](https://www.razon.com.mx/ciudad/segunda-ola-calor-cdmx-pone-nueve-alcaldias-alerta-obliga-medidas-preventivas-575790) nos afectan cada vez más y más en el día a día. Así, mientras en algunos estados, particularmente en el centro, el calor aún es fresco y soportable, en otros, ubicados en el norte, no deja de ser fuerte e intenso. Tanto que, incluso, habitantes de esta región del país advierten incendios, golpes de calor y más estragos de estas inusuales condiciones atmosféricas. Por ello, no es extraño escuchar que tanto las ciudades como sus habitantes se están “derritiendo”. Lo anterior se “comprobó” con una imagen que circuló en redes sociales, donde un semáforo en la ciudad de Monterrey, Nuevo León, fue víctima del calor y se derritió. Pero ¿cuál es la realidad detrás de esta curiosa imagen? Te contamos todo para que no te alarmes. 🚨🚨Ante la ola de calor ☀️🥵 en— Pachy Bautista (@pachybautista) [#Monterrey]un semáforo se está derritiendo. El video fue grabado en el Boulevard Rogelio Cantú en la colonia dan jeronimo [#NuevoLeon] [#OlaDeCalor] [#calor] [pic.twitter.com/U7gd6ZOfCe] [May 9, 2024] ¿Se derritió un semáforo por el calor en Monterrey? Esto sabemos En redes sociales se difundieron las fotografías de un semáforo consumido por el calor. Es decir, derretido al punto de que perdió su forma. Los semáforos normalmente están montados con hierro y otros tipos de metal, por lo cual, para que ocurriera ese fenómeno, las temperaturas en Monterrey debieron ser altísimas, argumentan usuarios en internet. Sin embargo, la realidad es que este poste no perdió su forma a causa de las altas temperaturas en el norte del país, sino que fue por otra razón. Alejandro Zúñiga, director de operaciones del cuerpo de bomberos de Nuevo León, informó en redes sociales que se atendió un incendio de un vehículo, ubicado en avenida Rogelio Cantú, fraccionamiento Gonzalitos, en Monterrey. Buenas tardes, Bomberos NL estación Central atiende reporte de incendio en vehículo, Fracc Gonzalitos atrás de Julio Cepeda, Mty y la Estación 5 atiende reporte de incendio en vehículo en Av Rogelio Cantú, sector San Jerónimo— Alejandro Zuñiga/Bomberos NL (@saz2000) [#Monterrey] [#NL] [#incendio] [#Bomberos] [pic.twitter.com/5R9brAdt2J] [May 8, 2024] Las fotografías del lugar en donde se atendió el siniestro corresponden con la ubicación del semáforo derretido. Por lo tanto: no, el semáforo no se derritió por las altas temperaturas, sino a causa del mismo accidente. De todas formas, esto no significa que el calor en Monterrey sea menor, pues esta semana la temperatura ha oscilado entre los 45 grados Celsius.

    "text": "Saber Interactive, Paramount Game Studios e lo sviluppatore Stormind Games sono entusiasti di lanciare oggi A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead , il gioco horror per giocatore singolo ispirato alla serie A Quiet Place di Paramount Pictures, acclamata dalla critica. Usate il vostro ingegno, insieme a tutti gli strumenti che riuscite a trovare, per rimanere in silenzio e sopravvivere alle creature mortali che vi inseguono in ogni momento. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead è disponibile in formato digitale per PC, PlayStation 5 e Xbox Series X|S al prezzo di 24,99 euro. Le copie fisiche del gioco per PlayStation 5 e Xbox Series X sono disponibili presso i principali rivenditori.\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead viene lanciato oggi accompagnato da un aggiornamento gratuito che introduce la nuova ed entusiasmante funzione “Rilevamento del rumore del microfono”. Se attivata, questa modalità utilizza un microfono collegato per catturare qualsiasi rumore della vita reale, trasformandolo in suoni di gioco che le creature possono rilevare. Sperimentate la tensione e la suspense a un livello completamente nuovo, mentre cercate di rimanere in silenzio di fronte alla paura, ma ricordate di non fare rumore!\nCatturando il terrore frenetico, l’atmosfera snervante e l’avvincente dramma umano che hanno reso famoso il franchise, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead è pensato per i fan dei film, dei videogiochi horror e delle avventure guidate dalla storia. Con nient’altro che il vostro ingegno e i semplici strumenti di cui potete disporre, dovrete superare le numerose sfide e gli ostacoli che vi si pareranno davanti, cercando di sopravvivere ai pericoli sempre in agguato.\nVivete lo straziante viaggio di Alex, un giovane studente universitario che soffre di asma e lotta per sopravvivere alla fine del mondo. Ma le creature da incubo che si aggirano per la terra non sono le uniche minacce che dovrete affrontare mentre viaggiate attraverso le rovine della civiltà alla ricerca di un rifugio sicuro per voi e la vostra famiglia.\nhttps://youtu.be/Sb_C7p0prc0\nDiscutine sul forum",
