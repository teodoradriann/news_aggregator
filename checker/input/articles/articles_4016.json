Compartir Linares de Riofrío ha vivido este viernes un intenso día con motivo de la llegada de sus majestades los Reyes Magos, que han visitado a los mayores de la localidad y han recibido a los más pequeños en la iglesia parroquial de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. Allí, además de entregar los regalos, se celebró la adoración al Niño Jesús en presencia del párroco, el padre Josbel, y las autoridades locales. Los quintos fueron también protagonistas de la jornada ya que son ellos los que colaboran en el desarrollo de la cabalgata, que congregó a numerosos vecinos en una animada tarde de fiesta. La jornada concluyó en la sede de la asociación de mayores para disfrutar de un chocolate con bizcochos como colofón a la jornada. Las celebraciones finalizarán este sábado, día 6 de enero, con la celebración de la misa de la Epifanía del Señor a la una del mediodía.

    "title": "¿Se aproxima concierto de Anuel AA en Puerto Rico?",
    "text": "¿Se aproxima concierto de Anuel AA en Puerto Rico?\nEsa fue la expectativa que creó el artista entre sus fanáticos, tras compartir en sus redes sociales que \"ya\" va a anunciar su primer concierto en la Isla, desde que salió de la cárcel en mayo del 2018. Este fue sentenciado en julio del 2017 a pasar 30 meses en prisión federal por posesión de armas de fuego. Sin embargo, salió 20 meses antes de cumplir su condena, por buena conducta.\n\"Estén al tiro pendiente todos los bandidos y todos los hp, todos los niños y todas mis reinas y mis princesas en el mundo entero, con el álbum nuevo y con la gira global en Estados Unidos, Latinoamérica, Europa y España\", anticipó Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago, nombre de pila del artista.\nEl intérprete de Adicto compartió la noticia a través de sus historias en Instagram, donde hizo referencia a un concierto en Argentina, de su última gira.\n\"Este fue uno de los últimos conciertos míos, el año pasado, 'sold out', igual que toda la gira entera... Gracias, mis amores, los amo\", manifestó Anuel AA.\nY es que, en septiembre del 2018, un concierto del artista, que estaba programado para el 12 de octubre de ese año en el Coliseo de Puerto Rico, fue cancelado debido a “diferencias de criterio”, informó en ese entonces el productor Paco López. Esa hubiera sido la primera presentación que el artista llevaría a cabo en dicho recinto.\nLa cancelación se produjo tras la salida de una \"tiraera\" de Anuel hacia Cosculluela, de alto contenido homofóbico y poco sensible hacia los pacientes que viven con VIH.\nAdemás, el cantante urbano hizo el anuncio en momentos en los que aún mantiene una guerra contra Yovngchimi, quien, hace unos meses, bajo su movimiento Glizzy Gvng, publicó unos ‘billboards’ en el área metro, que leen: “Anuel, te invitamos a pisar Puerto Rico”. Luego, lanzó una \"tiraera\", Lucifer, la cual en partes se dirige directamente a Anuel AA.\n\"Tú ere' un trili. Te mato, en tu casco, yo te pongo un Richard Mille. Tengo asesinos conmigo, si no, yo hago la dili (de una). Los Diablo' de Llorens, los demonio' de Philly\", lee parte de la letra del tema que le dedicó a Anuel.\nDe hecho, Gazmey Santiago no solo mantiene batalla con quien comparte el tema Baby Demon, sino que también ha encabezado múltiples controversias con Farruko y Arcángel en los pasados meses.\nA finales de noviembre, Farruko tildó a Anuel de \"sapo\", y posteriormente también lanzó otra \"tiraera\" contra él, S ̶A̶N̶ MIG ̶U̶E̶L̶. Hasta el momento, el intérprete urbano no ha lanzado música en respuesta a ninguna de las dos \"tiraeras\" antes mencionadas.\nTan reciente como el pasado mes de diciembre, tanto al líder del Glizzy Gvng como a Papi Arca se les vio en múltiples videos en las redes sociales en el residencial Luis Llorens Torres, luciendo una cadena presuntamente robada del hogar de Anuel en Miami.\n\"¿Tú no ves nada diferente en mi cuello? Para los fanáticos del huele bi**o ese. Veo gente sorprendida como si el hijo de p**a fuera un Dios de verdad. Tú lo que eres es tremendo ma**bi**o. ¿Qué pasó? ¿Qué es esto? Esto es tremenda basura\", expresó Arcángel, en la vivienda pública. Al cierre de esta noticia, Gazmey Santiago, no se ha expresado al respecto.\nEntretanto, Anuel no dio detalles de su posible presentación en la Isla, ni tampoco de la fecha del lanzamiento de su próxima discografía.",

    "title": "Worst NBA teams of the last 10 years amid Pistons' historic losing streak",
    "text": "The [Detroit Pistons](/nba/detroit-pistons) are having one of the worst seasons of all time. In fact, they already [set a new NBA record for consecutive losses](https://clutchpoints.com/where-pistons-sit-on-nbas-longest-losing-streak-list) in a single season. Their 27 straight losses are the most in league history, and there isn't a clear end in sight. The Pistons are on pace to have the worst season ever, but we wanted to rank the worst NBA teams of the last 10 years. That list is below. 10. 2023-24 San Antonio Spurs Lost in the shadow of the Pistons' losing streak this year is the fact the San Antonio Spurs are also having a horrible season. Detroit may only have two wins, but the [Spurs only have four wins](https://clutchpoints.com/spurs-san-antonio-struggles-2023-24) against 25 losses. This was not the outcome tthe Spurs were expecting. San Antonio was the worst team in the Western Conference last season, but Victor Wembanyama was supposed to turn this franchise around. The No. 1 overall pick of the 2023 NBA Draft was viewed as a truly generational prospect, with optimists believing he could make the Spurs playoff contenders as a rookie. Wembanyama has been solid overall and spectacular at times, but hasn't been as dominant as most expected while failing to make a tangible impact on winning for the Spurs. While the first two months of the season proved Wembanyama still has ample room to get better, he has been far from one of the biggest problems on the team. In fact, his teammates have struggled to get him the ball despite his 7'4 frame. This is largely due to the fact the team doesn't have many true point guards. Tre Jones is a point guard, but he comes off the bench. Meanwhile, San Antonio has [forced Jeremy Sochan into the lead point guard role](https://clutchpoints.com/spurs-news-jeremy-sochan-sets-record-straight-on-controversial-pg-take) despite the fact that he is a 6'9 forward much better suited to playing a secondary or even tertiary playmaking role. The Spurs lack players with vision, creation ability and the explosiveness to to consistently pressure the rim. On top of all of that, they also struggle from three-point land, which has only made it harder for the team to collapse the defense and get easy looks. San Antonio is only shooting 34.5% from deep. The Spurs have the potential to get better, but so far have been a major disappointment. Gregg Popovich has made some gambles with his personnel and game plans this year, and it is possible he switches things up soon if the team doesn't show improvement. 9. 2018-19 New York Knicks The New York Knicks are one of the most popular teams in the NBA, but they tied their franchise-worst record in 2018-19 when they went 17-65. The Knicks of this season didn't have the star power that New York is used to. In fact, the talent on the roster was pretty deprived overall. Tim Hardaway Jr. was the team's best player. His supporting cast included former lottery picks Dennis Smith Jr., Mario Hezonja and Emmanuel Mudiay, players who had all already been labeled as busts. Kevin Knox was supposed to make an impact as a rookie, too, but turned out to be on the path toward bust territory as well. 8. 2022-23 Detroit Pistons The Pistons may have set the record for the longest losing streak this season, but there were clear signs they were going to be bad dating back to last year. The Pistons went 17-65, largely because their best player, Cade Cunningham, [missed the majority of the year](https://clutchpoints.com/cade-cunningham-pistons-mulling-difficult-surgery-decision-amid-shin-injury) with an injury. The team made a number of moves at the trade deadline in an effort to get some wins under their belt, but none of them seemed to work. The Pistons only won three games after the NBA trade deadline, so their losing ways date back to last year as they had two losing streaks of 11 games to end the season. 7. 2015-16 [Los Angeles Lakers](/nba/los-angeles-lakers) The Los Angeles Lakers are the second-winningest team in NBA history with [3,519 total victories](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=nba+winningest+franchises+all-time), but were very bad in 2015-16. That year, they went 17-65. This was Kobe Bryant's famed retirement tour, but he didn't play like the [Kobe Bryant we all know](https://clutchpoints.com/24-best-moments-of-kobe-bryants-career-ranked) and love who is one of the [ greatest players of all time](https://clutchpoints.com/updating-ranking-the-50-greatest-players-nba). Bryant only averaged 17.6 points per game on putrid 35.8% shooting, but he also had to deal with playing with a roster of misfits and young players. D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr. were all young and still had a lot of developing to do. And players like Nick Young, Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams were score-first guards who didn't fit well alongside a ball-dominant player like Bryant. The team was full of inefficient shot-chuckers, and it led to the worst effective field goal percentage in the NBA. That fact, coupled with the fact the team wasn't great on defense, led to the Lakers being the worst team in the league in 2015-16. Los Angeles did have a saving grace, though. That was when Kobe Bryant [scored 60 points](https://www.nba.com/watch/video/this-day-in-history-kobe-bryant-scores-60-points-in-his-final-game) in his last game. 6. 2020-21 Houston Rockets The Houston Rockets have become a [pretty good team](https://clutchpoints.com/rockets-alperen-sengun-two-way-performance-spurs-victor-wembanyama) in 2023, but it took years of rebuilding to get here. That rebuild began during the 2020-21 season. James Harden was disgruntled, and he requested a trade. The star guard was moved after eight games, and the rest of the season was a disaster for Houston. However, the Rockets had attained a sizable haul of draft assets from the Harden trade, and tanking was the clear path they wanted to take. If losing was the goal, it worked. Houston lost a franchise record 20 straight games during this season. The team's league-worst record afforded them the chance to select Jalen Green, [struggling to find his niche](https://clutchpoints.com/rockets-news-will-jalen-green-be-benched-ime-udoka-weighs-in) with the revamped Rockets, in the 2021 NBA Draft. 5. 2014-15 Minnesota Timberwolves The 2014-15 Minnesota Timberwolves had just traded Kevin Love—one of the best players in the NBA—for rising sophomore Anthony Bennett and rookie Andrew Wiggins, the last two No. 1 overall picks of the NBA Draft. The young Timberwolves struggled. Bennett, in particular, was already cementing himself as one of the biggest draft busts of all time. Wiggins won the Rookie of the Year Award, but he did it by putting up what some described as empty numbers. Kevin Garnett also returned to Minnesota at the trade deadline, but he was in year 19 and way past his prime. Amazingly, 10 different Timberwolves players averaged double-digits in scoring. The team allowed 106.5 points per game, though, the worst mark in the NBA. 4. 2019-20 [Golden State Warriors](/nba/golden-state-warriors) It is weird to see a Golden State Warriors team from the last decade on this list. The Warriors have been the best team in the NBA over this time period, as they have won four championships and appeared in two other NBA Finals. They were not good in 2019-20, but also weren't the same team NBA fans have come to know. The Warriors made their fifth straight Finals appearance in 2018-19, but injuries killed their chances to win a third consecutive championship. Kevin Durant tore his achilles in Game 5 of the 2019 Finals before heading to the Brooklyn Nets the following summer, while Klay Thompson tore his ACL one game later, forcing him to miss the entirety of 2019-20. The Dubs even traded Andre Igudoala at the 2020 trade deadline. Golden State was shorthanded, but the expectation was that Steph Curry and Draymond Green could still carry the team to playoff contention. Things went even further south, though, when Steph Curry broke his second metacarpal in only the fifth game of the season. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the year, and Steve Kerr was relegated to replying on players who were never expected to be in the rotation. Additionally, Green struggled without his fellow superstars. Green is a defense-first player with good playmaking ability, but he is not a great scorer. His role-player mentality and play style didn't translate to being the top option, and he had his second-worst scoring season since his sophomore year. To make matters worse, the 2019-20 season was the weirdest season in NBA history. Concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the season early, with the action stopped in March. The season resumed in the NBA bubble in July, but the Warriors had the worst record in the league at the time and were not one of the 22 teams invited to continue the season. 3. 2013-14 [Milwaukee Bucks](/nba/milwaukee-bucks) The 2013-14 season was Giannis Antetokounmpo's rookie season and Khris Middleton's first season with the Bucks. If you remember right, though, those players weren't nearly as good at that point as we remember them to be today. Many people forget that Middleton actually spent his first season with the Pistons. He didn't do much there, and the team moved on from him after only a year. Antetokounmpo, on the other hand, was a skinny and raw prospect who was going to need time to develop. Middleton and Antetokounmpo showed flashes, but neither were great in their first year with the Bucks. Brandon Knight, Ramon Sessions and O.J. Mayo were the other talented players on the team, but they were all guards. The team lacked much production in the post, and that was especially true since Larry Sanders missed most of the season with injuries. 2. 2023-24 Detroit Pistons Detroit's 17-65 record was the worst in the NBA last year, yet they ended up with only the fifth overall pick. [Ausar Thompson has actually been good](https://clutchpoints.com/pistons-news-ausar-thompson-puts-myles-turner-poster-nasty-slam) for them, and he has even been one of the best rookies. However, he struggles shooting the ball, and he hasn't done enough to fix the Pistons' many other problems. Shooting is a glaring weakness on the team. At 33.5 percent from deep, Detroit is the second-worst shooting team in the NBA. The team has plenty of good slashers, but they don't have many catch-and-shoot threats to stretch the floor. Players like Cade Cuningham and Jaden Ivey thrive at getting to the rack, but they don't pair well together because of their lack of shooting prowess. The roster construction overall is not good, as not only are there few shooting threats, but the team has way too many bigs and not enough wings. Players like Jalen Duren, Isaiah Stewart, Marvin Bagley and James Wiseman are all best at center, but the logjam at that position has forced the Pistons to play multiple bigs at once. The clunkiness that comes with having so many bigs on the floor has only made life harder for their slashers, who are forced to drive into the teeth of a packed paint. Detroit is 2-28, but there is no end in sight for their long losing streak. Their next matchup is against the Boston Celtics, the team with the best record in the NBA. If they keep this up, they might go down as the worst team ever. 1. 2015-16 [Philadelphia 76ers](/nba/philadelphia-76ers) The most iconic “bad team” in the history of the NBA might be “The Process” Philadelphia 76ers. Philadelphia underwent a multi-year rebuild unlike anything the NBA had ever seen. The team basically invented modern-day tanking, as they deployed players who didn't belong in the NBA in an effort to lose games and get high draft picks. The rebuild didn't work perfectly in hindsight, but the results were there as the Sixers went only 10-72 in 2015-16. They finished the season with the [third-worst record](https://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Records/worstrecord.html) in NBA history. The team also had a 28-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which was the [longest overall](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/sixers-detroit-pistons-nba-losing-streak-robert-covington-20231228.html#:~:text=The%20reserve%20forward%2C%20now%20in,the%20start%20of%202015%2D16.) losing streak in NBA history. While the Sixers acquired a lot of talent through the draft because of their “process,” they didn't always take the right players. This season was a prime example of that, as Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes—three of their best players—all played center. This didn't even include Joel Embiid, another center, but one who missed the season with injury.",

Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250710-930-780610/1",

    "title": "Bangladesh opens mosque for transgender hijra community | The Business Standard",
    "text": "Hijra have been welcomed at a new mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka. Photo: REHMAN ASAD / AFP Kicked out of other prayer services, members of Bangladesh's transgender hijra community have been welcomed at a new mosque in the Muslim-majority nation with the promise of worship without discrimination. The humble structure -- a single-room shed with walls and a roof clad in tin -- is a new community hub for the minority, who have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice. \"From now on, no one can deny a hijra from praying in our mosque,\" community leader Joyita Tonu said in a speech to the packed congregation. \"No one can mock us,\" added the visibly emotional 28-year-old, a white scarf covering her hair. The mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, was built on land donated by the government after the city's hijra community were expelled from an established congregation. \"I never dreamt I could pray at a mosque again in my lifetime,\" said Sonia, 42, who as a child loved to recite the Koran and studied at an Islamic seminary. But when she came out as hijra, as transgender women in South Asia are commonly known, she was blocked from praying in a mosque. \"People would tell us: 'Why are you hijra people here at the mosques? You should pray at home. Don't come to the mosques,'\" Sonia, who uses only one name, told AFP. \"It was shameful for us, so we didn't go,\" she added. \"Now, this is our mosque. Now, no one can say no.\"\n'Like any other people' Hijra have been the beneficiaries of growing legal recognition in Bangladesh, which since 2013 has officially allowed members of the community to identify as a third gender. Several have entered Bangladeshi politics, with one transgender woman elected mayor of a rural town in 2021. But hijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights. They are also often discriminated against in employment and are much more likely to be victims of violent crime and poverty than the average Bangladeshi. Hardline Islamist groups have also lashed out at the recognition of transgender Bangladeshis in school textbooks, leading rallies to demand the government abandon its push to include them in the curriculum. Mufti Abdur Rahman Azad, founder of a hijra charity, told AFP that the new mosque was the first of its kind in the country. A similar endeavour planned in another city was stopped last month after a protest by locals, he added. Dozens of local hijra women donated time and money to build the Dakshin Char Kalibari Masjid for the Third Gender, which opened this month. It also has a graveyard, after a local Muslim cemetery last year refused to bury a young hijra woman inside its grounds. The mosque's imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith. \"They are like any other people created by Allah\", the cleric told AFP.\n'No one can be denied' \"We all are human beings. Maybe some are men, some are women, but all are human. Allah revealed the Holy Koran for all, so everyone has the right to pray, no one can be denied.\" Motaleb said that other Bangladeshis could learn from the faith and strength of the hijra. \"Since I have been here at this mosque, I have been impressed by their character and deeds,\" he said. The new mosque is already tackling prejudice. Local resident Tofazzal Hossain, 53, has offered Friday prayers there for a second week in a row. He said living and praying with the hijra community has changed his \"misconceptions\" about them. \"When they started to live with us, many people said many things,\" he told AFP. \"But we've realised what people say isn't right. They live righteously like other Muslims\". Tonu hopes to expand the simple mosque to be big enough to cater for more people. \"God willing, we will do it very soon,\" she told AFP. \"Hundreds of people can offer prayers together.\"",

Die Eltern hatten bereits im Mai mit einem Eilantrag beim Verwaltungsgericht Freiburg erreichen wollen, dass ihre Tochter täglich Fisch oder Fleisch in der Schulkantine bekommt. Sie argumentierten, ihre Tochter drohe angesichts des überwiegend vegetarischen Essens eine Mangelernährung. Die Freiburger Richter wiesen den Antrag ab und erklärten dazu, die Eltern könnten morgens und abends für die gewünschte Ernährung sorgen. Auch sei es möglich, vorbereitetes Essen in die Schule mitzubringen.\nDiese Nachricht wurde am 26.06.2025 im Programm Deutschlandfunk gesendet.",

    "title": "Valverde: \"Esta victoria supone muchísimo\"",
    "text": "El Athletic ha derrotado al Leganés en Butarque con goles de Dani Vivian e Iñaki Williams. De esta manera, los leones han logrado la segunda victoria consecutiva a domicilio tras la lograda el pasado domingo en el Estadio de Gran Canaria y dan la vuelta así al mal inicio con solo cuatro puntos sumados de doce posibles. “Cuando no ganas siempre tienes urgencias. En los primeros cuatro partidos no sumamos lo que queríamos. Hemos llegado a esta semana, que era importante para la Liga. Esta victoria supone muchísimo, nos refuerza y nos sirve para afrontar mejor la Europa League (debutan el jueves en Roma), pero nos queda un partido esta semana (Celta en San Mamés). La queremos terminar bien. Queremos situarnos donde queremos estar, pero hay que estar humildes, todos los equipos somos iguales y todo depende de un rebote como hoy, pero lo tienes que buscar”, ha señalado Valverde sobre el gol anotado por Vivian que ha desviado a la red Jorge Sáenz. “Ha sido un partido difícil, el primer tiempo lo hemos dominado pero no con claridad. Ellos han tenido una ocasión clara. En el segundo se ha roto el partido con el gol, pero ha sido un partido disputado en el que los dos equipos hemos buscado la victoria de diferentes maneras”, ha explicado. El gasteiztarra cree que les ha faltado finura en Butarque. “Teníamos más posibilidades de las que hemos conseguido. Nos ha faltado finura para definir bien. El partido lo teníamos nosotros, pero en el segundo tiempo ya no estaba tan claro. Se ha roto con el gol y después se han empezado a animar. Han pegado un palo. Ha sido un encuentro complicado como son todos aquí”. Unai Nuñez ha debutado con la camiseta rojiblanca en su segunda etapa en el Athletic, donde ha llegado como cedido del Celta. “Tenía un buen toro por delante con Haller y Miguel. Se ha fajado bien, ha tenido que jugar los noventa minutos y ha aguantado bien. Ha dado dos palos, uno en cada portería. También han jugado de inicio Álvaro (Djaló) y Gorosabel. Es bueno para nosotros que el equipo sea largo, los partidos vienen muy seguidos”, ha afirmado. Dani Vivian ha jugado un gran partido. Además ha marcado el 0-1 y ha estrellado un balón de chilena en el larguero. \"Para nosotros es un seguro. Mantiene un alto grado de concentración, parece fácil pero es complicado estar noventa minutos concentrado y no dar ni un metro al rival. No concede nada. Es difícil defender a Haller con 1,90. Para nosotros es un baluarte, fundamental, tiene el premio de ir a la selección, estamos encantados con él\", ha reconocido su entrenador. El entrenador ya había dicho en la previa del partido que para él no hay unidad A ni unidad B. \"Somos solo una unidad, un equipo. Hay veces que sale uno de refresco y mete un gol. Se da importancia a quien sale de inicio. Sabes quién empieza pero también hay que ver quién acaba el partido\", ha explicado.",

    "text": "Alrededor de 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing afiliados al Distrito 751 y W24 de la International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers votaron en la tarde del jueves (hora del Pacífico) sobre el nuevo convenio laboral propuesto por la compañía, así como por un llamado a la huelga.\nAproximadamente el 95% de los votantes rechazaron el contrato, y el 96% aprobaron la huelga (que comenzará a la medianoche del 13 de septiembre) , resultados esperados considerando que el acuerdo tentativo anunciado el domingo incluía solo un 25% de aumento salarial en un período de cuatro años, cuando los trabajadores habían pedido el 40%.\nPara contrarrestar esa diferencia, Boeing jugó una carta clave: comprometerse a que el nuevo avión comercial que desarrollarían se fabricaría en el área de Seattle y Portland, para así garantizar estabilidad laboral en esa región. Pero había una “trampa”: esto era válido solo si el programa se anunciaba antes de 2028.\nEl fabricante estadounidense también prometió mejoras en los planes de salud y retiro, un bono de 3 mil dólares, reducción en las horas extra obligatorias y la actualización de categoría de 4.000 empleados.\nPero nada de esto fue suficiente, y ahora, a todos los problemas que Boeing viene acarreando, se le suma el de la primera huelga de esta magnitud desde 2008, cuando se extendió por 57 días. Diversos analistas financieros de entidades como UBS y TD Cowen estimaron que si la huelga se extiende de manera similar, Boeing podría enfrentar una sangría de entre 3 y 4 mil millones de dólares, otro duro golpe a una empresa que no ve números positivos desde 2018.\nEl impacto también llegaría a las aerolíneas, que tendrán que enfrentar aún más demoras en las entregas de nuevos aviones.",

    "text": "- Recognized for excellence in augmented reality technology, apps, and device sets.\n- To be showcased at the CES 2024 booth... with a new Disney product launch planned for the first half of the year.\nWoongjin Thinkbig's ARpedia, a global edutech product, has won the 'CES 2024 Innovation Award', marking the first time a Korean educational company has achieved this honor three times in a row. Leading the global education market as a pioneering edutech solution, ARpedia has demonstrated its unique augmented reality technology and innovation.\nARpedia, developed by Woongjin Thinkbig, one of Korea's leading edutech companies, is an 'Interactive Book' that provides a three-dimensional reading experience by bringing characters and illustrations from books to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. In Korea, it's a popular series with over 6 million individual books sold. Internationally, it has proven its market potential with contracts to supply at least 80,000 sets annually in the Chinese-speaking region (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau).\nThis achievement is largely attributed to the global recognition of ARpedia's unique technology and educational effectiveness. At CES 2024, ARpedia won the 'Mobile Devices and Accessories' innovation award, securing its third consecutive title. This particular win is noteworthy as it acknowledges the excellence of ARpedia in all aspects of its set, including augmented reality technology (CES 2023, AR/VR category), apps (CES 2022-2023, Mobile Apps category), and devices (CES 2024).\nWoongjin Thinkbig plans to introduce ARpedia to business representatives and visitors from various countries at CES 2024. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore all series that comprise the ARpedia set and learn in detail about the products' features and usage.\nFurthermore, Woongjin Thinkbig is set to launch a new reading series, 'Disney Interactive Reading', in the first half of this year, based on a licensing agreement with Walt Disney. The initial marketing strategy will focus on Asian countries, where there is high demand for English reading education.\nSam-rak Choi, the head of Woongjin Thinkbig's EduTech Research Institute, commented, \"ARpedia is sought after by companies and educational industry representatives in 24 countries where it is currently exported. With various new products including Disney Interactive Reading slated for release this year, it is poised to establish itself as a global representative edutech product”.\n▲ Introduction of ARpedia\nARpedia, an experiential reading product that provides a three-dimensional reading experience through augmented reality (AR) technology, was launched in Korea in 2019 under the 'Interactive Book' brand. Targeting the international market, the English version of 'ARpedia' has received much acclaim and several global awards, including being the first Korean educational company to win the 'CES Innovation Award' three times in a row. In 2022 alone, ARpedia won the 'Kid’s Judge BETT', 'Mom’s Choice Award', and 'Teacher’s Choice Award', proving its success with children, parents, and teachers alike. In July 2023, Woongjin Thinkbig signed a licensing agreement with global entertainment giant Walt Disney for the launch of the Disney series.\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BmORcfbQo8\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: WOONGJIN THINKBIG\nContact Person: JR Kim\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: South Korea\nWebsite: http://www.arpediabook.com\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",
