    "text": "Cuatro goles en un cuarto de hora ampliados por los dos anotados al inicio de la segunda parte, reafirmaron la distancia sideral entre el [Liverpool](https://www.bluradio.com/deportes/futbol/luis-diaz-tendra-un-nuevo-e-importante-estratega-en-el-liverpool-clave-de-klopp-cb20) y su rival, el Sparta Praga (6-1), en la vuelta de una eliminatoria sentenciada ya en la ida, cuando el conjunto de Jurgen Klopp ganó por 1-5. Salah lideró la contundente cara de presentación de los reds. El egipcio marcó uno de los cuatro tantos del inicio, el tercero, y asistió en otros dos, el del joven Bobby Clark, en el minuto 8 y el del neerlandés Cody Gakpo, en el 14. La cuenta la había abierto el uruguayo [Darwin Núñez,](https://www.bluradio.com/deportes/futbol/eliminatorias/darwin-nunez-nos-llevamos-un-buen-punto-contra-colombia-el-penal-nos-vino-muy-bien-cb20) a los siete minutos, tras recibir un balón del húngaro Dominik Szoboszlai. Al borde del descanso, el conjunto centroeuropeo maquilló la situación por medio del bosnio Veljko Birmancevic a pase del ecuatoriano Angelo Preciado. No levantó el pie del acelerador ni el [Liverpool](https://www.bluradio.com/deportes/futbol/luis-diaz-y-los-goles-que-se-perdio-con-el-liverpool-ante-el-manchester-city-so35) ni Salah tras el descanso.

Publicidad Hizo el sexto Marca Cody Gakpo, el segundo en su cuenta personal, y el Liverpool bajó el ritmo. Con un cómputo total de 11-2 el representante inglés, favorito al título en esta edición de la Liga Europa, dio por bueno el asunto y el resto fue un trámite. El Liverpool alcanza así los cuartos de final de la Liga Europa mientras el Sparta se despide del torneo continental.",

    "title": "IHOP worker gets fired for feeding homeless man, but her inspiring response wins hearts",
    "text": "An IHOP worker's kind gesture of feeding a homeless man led to unexpected consequences—but her courage to stand firm stole hearts.\nWe have all been[ taught to help others](https://scoop.upworthy.com/sickle-cell-survivor-fulfills-dream-of-becoming-doctor-to-help-others-like-her), especially those in need. But in a world full of inequalities, extending a helping hand may not always end on a happy note. The same thing happened to a woman whose kind act forced her out of work. In an incident from Florida’s Polk County, a [worker at IHOP](https://scoop.upworthy.com/stunned-customer-ihop-answers-phone-discoverin-staff-quit-shift) named Victoria Hughes was fired just before the holidays. The Lakeland resident’s only “fault” was feeding a homeless man who recently showed up at the popular American food chain’s restaurant, reported [NBC affiliate WFLA.](https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/i-need-my-job-server-at-lakeland-ihop-claims-she-was-fired-after-feeding-man-in-need/)\nIt all started with Hughes deciding not to turn away the [homeless stranger asking for some food](https://scoop.upworthy.com/homeless-man-asks-restaurant-if-they-have-spare-food-and-was-offered-a-chair-and-anything-on-menu-ex1). “He stated to me and the host that he was hungry. Without a second thought, I bought the stack of pancakes and gave him water,” she said, per the outlet.\nIt all went well, and the homeless man left the restaurant with a smile on his face. Notably, Hughes had been working at the IHOP off US 98 in Lakeland for the past thirteen years before she was let go by her manager.\nHughes’ manager later learned about it and took up the matter with her. Following this, the dedicated worker discussed the situation with her superior but was surprised by the response to her kindness toward the helpless stranger. The [restaurant chain’s](https://scoop.upworthy.com/man-puts-his-foot-down-and-refuses-to-pay-after-being-forced-to-cover-restaurant-bill-for-strangers-ex1) manager was firmly of the opinion that feeding the man would cause a “safety” or “loitering issue.”\n“He told me the reason behind him being upset because it could cause a loitering issue was that things like that are a safety issue for customers,” Hughes said.\nHowever, all the management reportedly did was warn their long-time server. According to Hughes, when the same man returned for another meal days later, this time with his family, the situation at work became heated. Hughes couldn’t stop herself from helping the homeless family by feeding them again. This time, the manager was in no mood [to support her](https://scoop.upworthy.com/woman-tears-up-as-all-her-friends-show-up-without-invitation-to-support-her-new-business-on-day-1-ex2) kindness toward strangers. On November 26, she received a call from her superior with the dreadful news. The restaurant chain, managed by Sunshine Restaurant Partners in Lakeland, decided to let her go. When she asked the manager for a reason, he excused himself by citing it as “company policy.”\nDespite losing her job just before the holidays, Hughes still believed in her decision to stand by the homeless man and his family. “I need my job, but I would still do it again. I would still help somebody if I could,” she added. After her story received media attention, IHOP’s corporate office retracted their earlier decision by offering her the job back, along with the[ missed compensation](https://scoop.upworthy.com/employees-quick-thinking-makes-company-pay-500-k-compensation-for-mandatory-annual-retreat). But Hughes had not made up her mind to return to work as she was instead spending time at home with her family. She started a [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/aid-victoria-fired-for-feeding-the-hungry) to get through this holiday season.\nNot thinking of the holiday rush and her commitment to work, she added, “If he asked me for my shirt, I probably would have tried to give him that too.”\nMeanwhile, the manager told Hughes that the business had decided to make a \"healthy donation\" to a charity of their choice in the local community. The company also issued a statement on the matter, referring to their commitment to providing an [inclusive environment](https://scoop.upworthy.com/oregon-church-epic-sign-game-goes-viral-inclusive-political-messages-ex2). “As we actively investigate this situation, we will utilize this as an opportunity to train our employees on how to approach instances surrounding food insecurity,” Dan Enea, a representative from Sunshine Restaurant Partners and IHOP Fran, concluded.",
