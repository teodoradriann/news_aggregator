EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines Close Photo: Getty Images A healthy lifestyle is just as important as a healthy diet. Whatever you can do to keep your body moving, whether it be taking walks or strength training, is beneficial for not only muscle growth and weight maintenance, but also your mind. And The Good Place actor Jameela Jamil just addressed how the importance of exercise goes beyond the scale. In a recent episode of her podcast I Weigh with Jameela Jamil, Jamil hints at a new project she’s working on to “get people moving.” From there, she digs into how exercise is more than just about physical fitness and that its benefits exceed body results. “It's not about weight loss,” she explains. “It's not about calories in, calories out. It is democratizing exercise.” From body type to activity level, fitness does not have to look a certain way. That is why accessible exercise is so important as it allows people of most forms of mobility to be able to include activity in their daily routines. Plus, exercise being accessible for all means that it’s accepted for all. The gym can be an intimidating place for those just starting their fitness journey, so having spaces that are inclusive and welcoming to beginners is essential. 7 \"Polite\" Things You Do at the Gym That Are Actually Rude Jamil goes on to explain that exercise is commonly linked to the diet industry, which adds to this pressure that weight loss should be prioritized in health goals, when it doesn’t always have to be. “They have not only excluded all of us, but they priced everyone out of being able to exercise,” she says on diet culture. “They've made people feel ashamed that they're not even fit enough yet to start exercising.

    "title": "Kel Mitchell Reminds Fans to Ask God for Help: ‘He Will Show You’",
    "text": "Kel Mitchell Reminds Fans to Seek God’s Guidance: ‘He Will Show You’ By Movieguide® Contributor Actor Kel Mitchell recently took to Instagram to encourage his followers to look to God for direction. “Happy Sunday,” he [began](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1PoqxgJI4h/) a recent Reel. “When you express your concerns to the Lord, he will show you the way to go.” “It’s just like the three wise men, right? They had a journey that they needed to go on, alright, they wanted to see Jesus, right? So, God shined a star in the east for them to follow and directed them straight to him. So, if [there is] anything that you’re going through, and you need direction, and you need a plan, and you need to know where to go, don’t spend one minute without God,” Mitchell [encouraged](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1PoqxgJI4h/). The former Nickelodeon star has been outspoken about his faith, often encouraging his fans to turn to and trust God. This Christmas season, the actor partnered with World Vision to help those in need. “I’ve been working with World Vision for years,” Mitchell [told](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/) The Hollywood Reporter. “They reached out to me because they know that I love giving back and helping others…I love God and giving back and putting a smile on people’s faces. And one of the quotes that I use all the time is ‘spread love like confetti.’” World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, [aims](https://www.worldvision.org/about-us) to show Christ’s love and “partner with children, families, and their communities to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.” As part of his partnership with the organization, Mitchell participated in its Global 6k for Water race. This represents the average distance women and children must walk to get water in developing countries. “It’s a blessing to be a blessing,” he [said](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/). This is something he’s teaching his children, too. “It’s a great way to show your kids how to help as well,” he [said](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/). “We just put up the Christmas tree and we have an alpaca ornament. And when my kids see that, they also know that we also got a real alpaca to help someone overseas and help a family. It’s really just about giving back and letting everyone know that we’re all God’s children and we’re all family.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/kel-mitchell-encourages-us-to-lean-on-gods-understanding.html) on Mitchell: Actor Kel Mitchell is encouraging people to “lean” on God and work with Him to “create something cool within your life.” “When I was a kid, I wanted to learn the Michael Jackson ‘lean’ move,” the GOOD BURGER star [explained]in an Instagram video, adding that it was a difficult move that could “break your face” if you didn’t do it correctly. Mitchell went on to say that he later found out Jackson worked with a designer who made him magnetic shoes, which allowed him to perform the move. “They were working together and created something really, really cool, and that is what God is saying to you,” Mitchell said before reciting Proverbs 3:5-6. “Lean not on your own understanding…[because] you’ll end up hurting yourself. But lean on my understanding, lean on my knowledge, my ideas, and I will direct your path, and we can really create something really cool together.” He concluded, “Let the Creator who created you create something cool within your life every day. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.” We are a crowdfunded organization, supported by people like you. These are some of the reasons why our supporters choose to give. \"Your efforts to promote that which is of the highest value. \" You can make a difference with as little as $7.

    "text": "Video: Boeing 777 makes 'terrifying' landing at London airport amid strong winds An American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to London recently experienced a turbulent landing at London's Heathrow Airport, which was captured on video. Despite the dramatic landing, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to the aircraft. Listen to Story An American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to London made a tumultuous landing at London Heathrow Airport on Wednesday (UK local time). The incident took place amidst the intense Storm Gerrit, which brought gale-force winds across the United Kingdom, as reported by Fox Business. The Boeing 777, identified as Flight 134, was captured on video by Big Jet TV as it approached the runway around 11:40 am local time. The footage shows the aircraft being buffeted by strong crosswinds, causing it to veer and tip alarmingly to the left. The pilot managed to nearly stabilise the plane before it made contact with the runway, only to bounce dramatically upon touchdown, as per the report. The video, now widely circulating online, shows the front landing gear making contact with the ground, causing the nose of the plane to rebound into the air before eventually settling back onto the tarmac. Onlookers and aviation enthusiasts watched with bated breath as the plane eventually came to a halt without further incident. Despite the dramatic landing, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to the aircraft, according to Fox Business. American Airlines has yet to release a statement regarding the incident.",

Un video difundido en redes muestra a un grupo de personas manifestando su inconformidad a las afueras de la casa de campaña de la morenista Azucena Cisneros de Ecatepec, y señalando que habrían votado por ésta motivados porque recibirían una remuneración económica. \"Así como le dimos el gane ahora que nos pague\", se escucha decir entre las protestas. Al lugar llegó una mujer quien dijo ser la coordinadora de la casa de campaña de Azucena Cisneros, señalando que 'Ahí no es una sede de pago' y que 'para recibir el dinero que les prometieron' tienen que ir directamente a las sedes. Como era de esperarse, la escena no tardó en llenarse de críticas y burlas por parte de internautas en redes sociales, reprobando las acciones de los pobladores al supuestamente vender sus votos.",

This is good news as Dennis Allen had said yesterday his hope was to get Hill on the practice field in at least a limited capacity .\nOne day after Marshon Lattimore returned to practice, the Saints got back Hill, who is a critical component in their offense. He was used primarily in a blocking role last week but we all know what his talents truly are.\nWe will get further information when the official injury report releases later Thursday afternoon as to whether or not this was a limited practice for Hill or a full practice. The assumption would be the prior, but any status update that results in positive momentum towards him playing Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles is a great sign.\nArticles The Saints are taking a unique approach to the NFL's new kickoff format Tyrann Mathieu discusses why he's excited to come to work every day Blake Grupe ranks among the best kickers in the NFL with this advanced metric Report: Derek Carr fined $14,000 by NFL for Michael Jackson TD celebration Taliese Fuaga crowned as the NFL's best rookie through two weeks",

Un motard de 48 ans a été tué ainsi qu'une femme de 56 ans.\nSecouristes et services de nettoyage sont à l'oeuvre vendredi à Taïwan après le passage de Kong-rey, l'un des plus gros typhons que l'île ait connu ces dernières décennies et qui a fait au moins deux morts et plus de 500 blessés.\nLa tempête, accompagnée de bourrasques atteignant 184 km/h et de pluies torrentielles, a touché terre jeudi en début d'après-midi au sud-est du territoire, et a balayé l'île entière, arrachant des arbres, provoquant des inondations et des glissements de terrain.\nUn motard de 48 ans a été tué jeudi par la chute d'un poteau électrique à Taipei, et une femme de 56 ans est morte après la chute d'un arbre sur son véhicule, dans le comté de Nantou (centre), a déclaré l'agence nationale des incendies, tandis que plus de 500 autres personnes ont été blessées.\nPrès de 100.000 foyers sont toujours privés d'électricité\nÀ lire aussi\nPlus d'articles dans International\n[Inondations en Espagne : pourquoi un nombre de victimes si élevé ?](/fr/inondations-en-espagne-pourquoi-un-nombre-de-victimes-si-eleve)\n[Espagne : les \"inondations du siècle\" font 95 morts, la recherche de survivants se poursuit](/fr/espagne-les-inondations-du-siecle-font-95-morts-la-recherche-de-survivants-se-poursuit)\n[Taïwan : le puissant typhon Kong-rey fait au moins un mort et 73 blessés](/fr/taiwan-le-puissant-typhon-kong-rey-fait-au-moins-un-mort-et-73-blesses)\n[Inondations en Espagne : pourquoi un nombre de victimes si élevé ?](/fr/inondations-en-espagne-pourquoi-un-nombre-de-victimes-si-eleve)\n[Espagne : les \"inondations du siècle\" font 95 morts, la recherche de survivants se poursuit](/fr/espagne-les-inondations-du-siecle-font-95-morts-la-recherche-de-survivants-se-poursuit)\n[Taïwan : le puissant typhon Kong-rey fait au moins un mort et 73 blessés](/fr/taiwan-le-puissant-typhon-kong-rey-fait-au-moins-un-mort-et-73-blesses)\nDes recherches sont en cours pour retrouver quatre personnes parties chasser dans les montagnes du centre de Taïwan mercredi et dont on est sans nouvelles. Deux randonneurs tchèques coincés dans le parc de Taroko du comté de Hualien pendant le typhon ont été secourus vendredi.\nEn traversant le détroit de Taïwan en direction de la Chine vendredi, Kong-rey s'est affaibli pour devenir une forte tempête tropicale, selon l'Administration météorologique centrale.\nDans tout Taïwan, le travail et les cours ont repris, et les magasins et les restaurants ont rouvert. Cependant, près de 100.000 foyers sont toujours privés d'électricité et 191 vols intérieurs et internationaux ont été annulés. Des dizaines de liaisons ferrys et ferroviaires restent suspendues.\n\"Le typhon était tellement fort\", rapporte Pan Li-chu, interrogé par l'AFP devant son restaurant à Taipei, où le store s'est plié avec la force du vent.\nDes pluies torrentielles se sont abattues sur la ville de Toucheng, dans la région d'Yilan, et ont fait couler de la boue et des débris dans les rues. Les inondations ont atteint le jardin de Wu Hsuan-Kai, 55 ans, qui regardait la télévision jeudi, quand il a entendu un étrange \"grondement\". \"Quand j'ai ouvert la porte, j'ai vu un coulée de boue arriver lentement, j'ai attrapé mes clefs de voiture et je suis parti en courant\" raconte-t-il à l'AFP.\nDans la région de Taitung (sud-est) où le typhon s'est abattu en premier, les dégâts concernent \"surtout des arbres qui sont tombés et se sont écrasés sur les poteaux électriques et provoqué des pannes de courant\", a expliqué un responsable des pompiers, qui n'a donné que son nom de famille, Huang.\nUn typhon très tardif\nDans toute l'île, des employés des services d'entretien se sont levés aux aurores afin de ramasser les arbres, les branches et autres débris sur les routes. \"Nous avons commencé à nettoyer à partir de 5 heures du matin et nous n'avons nettoyé qu'un seul tronçon de route, cela nous a pris a peu près deux heures et demi\", a déclaré à l'AFP Lee Chia-hsin, un membre de l'équipe de nettoyage de la ville de New Taipei.\nTaïwan est habitué aux tempêtes tropicales, fréquentes de juillet à octobre, mais il est \"inhabituel pour un typhon si puissant de frapper l'île aussi tard dans l'année\", note le météorologue Chang Chun-yao. Le changement climatique augmente leur intensité, avec de grandes averses, des crues soudaines et de très fortes rafales de vent, selon les scientifiques.\nKong-rey est le troisième typhon à frapper Taïwan depuis juillet. Cet été, le typhon Gaemi a causé la mort de dix personnes et fait des centaines de blessés, provoquant de vastes inondations dans la ville méridionale de Kaohsiung.\n(upday avec AFP)",
