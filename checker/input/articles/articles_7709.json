    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

During the initial investigation, evidence found at the location indicated that the male may have overdosed from the use of illicit narcotics. After the autopsy, results provided by the Montgomery County Forensic Center confirmed that the male died of the toxic effects of Heroin and Methamphetamine.\nAs a result of the investigation, the individual responsible for providing the Heroin and Methamphetamine to the decedent was identified as 62-year-old Douglas Hendon from Livingston, Texas. An arrest warrant was obtained, and he was arrested on April 7, 2025. Douglas was transported to the Montgomery County Jail, where he was charged with Delivery of a Controlled Substance causing Death for supplying Heroin and Methamphetamine that resulted in the death of a Montgomery County resident.\nThe Montgomery County Narcotics Enforcement Team is a cooperative multi-agency task force which consists of law enforcement agencies from, Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, Walker County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Department of Public Safety-CID, Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office, Homeland Security Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Participating agencies recognized that a special collaborative effort was necessary to more effectively combat the drug distribution throughout the area.",

Jeffery Lynn Meche, 65, was arrested and charged last Friday with vehicular homicide, driving on the right side of the road and not wearing a seat belt, Jeff Davis Parish Sheriff Office's rosters show. Louisiana State Police issued a warrant to arrest Meche after toxicology results alleged Meche to be intoxicated when his pickup truck struck the vehicle of Chelsey E. Benoit, 29, which resulted in her death on Sept. 17, 2023, Louisiana State Police said. On Sept. 17, Troopers responded to two vehicle crash near the intersection of Louisiana Highway 26 and Hillias Road in Jefferson Davis Parish about 5 miles south of Jennings. Meche's 2014 GMC pickup truck traveled north on LA 26., according to police. Meche struck Benoit's 2006 GMC Envoy when his vehicle entered the southbound lane. It is unclear why his vehicle entered the lane, a Troop D press release said. Toxicology analysis show that Meche was intoxicated at the time of the crash. Benoit and Meche were both unrestrained when they crashed. Benoit was transported to a local hospital and later died to her injuries. Meche received moderate injuries and was transported to a Lafayette hospital. Meche was booked at the Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff's Office jail with a bond of $250,000.",

    "title": "Rodgers veut être « grandiose », rien de moins!",
    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main)\nAaron Rodgers est prêt à faire un retour mémorable\nÀ quelques jours d'entamer sa 20e saison dans la NFL, le quart-arrière des\nJets de New York Aaron Rodgers était d'un moral si enjoué qu'il était désormais capable de rire de la blessure qui l'a affligé la saison dernière.\nComplètement rétabli, le très confiant joueur vedette dit s'attendre à faire un retour mémorable.\n« Je tire beaucoup de fierté de mes performances, alors quand j'embarque sur le terrain, je m'attends à offrir du jeu grandiose parce que je l'ai déjà fait avant », a dit Rodgers avant l'entraînement. « C'est le genre de standard que je place pour moi. »\nÀ 40 ans, Rodgers est le joueur le plus âgé de la ligue. Il fera face aux\n49ers de San Francisco lundi soir, à deux jours de la date d'anniversaire de cette fameuse déchirure du tendon d'Achilles survenue dès la quatrième remise de la première possession offensive des siens, ce qui a fait essentiellement dérailler la saison des Jets.\n« Il pourrait y avoir un petit sourire en coin après la quatrième remise cette fois », a admis Rodgers.\nRodgers n'a pas disputé de match complet en 20 mois, ce qui remonte à sa dernière rencontre avec les\nPackers de Green Bay en 2022. Il n'a pas non plus joué durant la présaison, bien qu'il ait pris part à de beaucoup de répétitions (approximativement 800) durant le camp d'entraînement.\nMalgré ses nombreux accomplissement, incluant le fait d'avoir été nommé quatre fois joueur par excellence et d'avoir remporté un Super Bowl, Rodgers dit avoir encore des choses à prouver, mais surtout à lui-même.\nLes Jets aspirent au Super Bowl et ils comptent grandement sur le vétéran pour y parvenir.\n« Je crois qu'il est à une bonne place, pas juste mentalement, mais physiquement aussi », affirme l'entraîneur Robert Saleh. « Vous le voyez ici chaque jour, il paraît bien. C'est un professionnel, ça fait longtemps qu'il fait ça. Mais il n'a pas l'air d'avoir 40 ans. »\nRodgers a bien lancé durant le camp, mais une des choses qui a impressionné ses coéquipiers est sa façon de bouger à l'extérieur de sa pochette. Il ne semble pas avoir de séquelle de sa blessure, mais bien sûr, il n'a pas encore fait face au même type de pression qu'en match régulier.\nRodgers a lui-même réitéré que les Jets, qui ont affiché un dossier de 7-10 lors des deux dernières campagnes, sont des aspirants au Super Bowl.\n« Bien sûr », assure Rodgers, qui a vanté notamment sa ligne offensive. Il a également souligné la maturité qui règne au sein du vestiaire, avec une mentalité qui aidera l'équipe à bien réagir face à l'adversité. »\nIl avait émis des commentaires similaires à la fin de la dernière saison, en disant que l'équipe devait éliminer les distractions et \"flush the B.S.\", en référence à certaines critiques qu'il a attirées. Rodgers a défrayé les manchettes quand des rumeurs évoquaient son nom à titre de candidat comme vice-président ou entourant un voyage non autorisé pendant un minicamp obligatoire qui lui a valu une amende de la part de l'organisation.\nDepuis, ses entraîneurs et coéquipiers affirment que toute sa concentration est sur le football.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "El Cristo de las Aguas recupera la fisonomía que le dio Antonio Illanes",
    "text": "El Santísimo Cristo de las Aguas ha regresado este viernes 29 al calor devocional del fervor de sus hijos y devotos, en medio de este frío y crudo diciembre, como si de un regalo de Navidad se tratase antes de que se escriba el punto final de este año 2023. Desde el pasado verano se hallaba esta efigie de Antonio Illanes Rodríguez en el taller de la empresa Musae Restauración de Arte, que tiene su sede en el Polígono Calonge, donde el crucificado ha sido acertadamente intervenido por las conservadoras y restauradoras Esther Soler y Ana Cordero, quienes han contado con un equipo multidisciplinar integrado, como ya suele ser habitual por parte de estas profesionales, por el historiador del arte Ramsés Torres, así como por químicos y biólogos pertenecientes a Sanit-Arte, además del equipo técnico de radiología Axati. Según hacen saber las citadas Soler y Cordero, «la fase cognoscitiva ha sido fundamental antes de iniciar la intervención», ya que la misma consistió en «la realización de varios análisis previos fundamentales». Además, durante estas tareas se pudieron determinar los agentes de deterioro, lo que ha sido clave para tratar de discernir la historia material de la talla cristífera, siendo posible todo ello «mediante el reconocimiento organoléptico, la recopilación de datos y estudios, la extracción de muestras con el examen de los distintos estratos, así como observaciones realizadas gracias a la aplicación de técnicas radiológicas». Esta restauración ha permitido que se elimine la suciedad superficial que presentaba el Cristo de las Aguas, así como sanear las grietas que presentaba y las aberturas del soporte, que se localizaban fundamentalmente en las uniones de los brazos con el tronco de la bendita imagen y con su sudario o paño de pureza. Especialmente llama la atención la perfilada barba que presenta ahora, ya que en una intervención efectuada por Peláez del Espino décadas atrás, éste retocó la policromía del rostro, trastocando la concepción original de Illanes en la fisonomía. De hecho, la recuperación de estos rasgos faciales, especialmente en el bigote y en los pómulos, donde la barba está realmente más rebajada, permite destacar más aún la honda expresividad de la boca del Señor. Illanes, que fue hermano mayor de esta cofradía y precisamente ocupaba dicho cargo cuando esta talla se convirtió en titular tras perderse la anterior en el incendio acaecido en la Iglesia de San Jacinto en octubre de 1942, obra también de este mismo artista, realizó la actual imagen en el año 1941, como queda reflejado en el sudario junto con su firma, y con la que el escultor alcanzó la primera Medalla de Plata en la Exposición Nacional de Arte Sacro en 1942, por lo que la efigie no se hizo originalmente para esta hermandad, un dato que ya se conocía, eso sí. Durante esta intervención, según apuntan las restauradoras, «se han llevado a cabo reintegraciones con técnicas al agua de áreas de la policromía que se habían perdido, así como completar la ornamentación tan característica del paño de pureza que se encontraba deteriorada».",

    "text": "Reenlistments on the USS Carney destroyer spiked after the ship’s first engagement with attack drones launched from Houthi-controlled Yemen, a top Navy officer said, according to Military Times.\nThe Carney, along with other guided-missile destroyers, have\ndowned dozens of drones and missiles in the Red Sea to protect international shipping from the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in recent months. When the Carney shot down missiles the Houthis appeared to launch toward Israel in October, the urgency and importance of the warship’s mission appeared to resonate with crew members, Cmdr. Jeremy Robertson, commander of the Carney, reportedly told Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, who formerly commanded the warship and is now the head of Naval Surface Forces, according to Military Times.\n“[Robertson] told me that, two days after their first engagement, he had 15 reenlistment contracts on his desk,” McLane told Military Times. “I think this has something to do with the investment that we’ve made in [weapons tactics instructors], and the investment that we’ve made in developing a warfighting culture.”\n“Our sailors are incredibly energized by being able to operate their weapons systems in the way that they are intended and seeing success in doing that,” he added.\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebels have sought, sometimes successfully, to attack commercial vessels. Missiles and drones have also been aimed at U.S. Navy vessels. The Houthis say they are targeting Israel-linked vessels in response to the country’s war against Hamas in Gaza, but so far the attacks appear indiscriminate.\nExperts and officers agree the Navy surface fleet is\nlearning from the type and volume of engagements, which come at a pace unknown in modern history, according to Military Times. Destroyers have not participated in major gunfights since they were tasked with providing support during the Vietnam War, Jan van Tol, a retired forward-deployed warship captain and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said.\nMcLane did not say how the incidents have informed tactics or ongoing training, but added that the fleet is monitoring developments “very closely,” the outlet reported.\nThe real fight continues. BZ to both teams for playing a good game. 🤝 Until next year.\nHooyah USS Carney (DDG 64)!\n[#GoNavy]! [#AlwaysForward] [#ArmyNavyGame2023] [pic.twitter.com/zNrLqtN8TJ]\n— U.S. Navy (@USNavy)\n[December 9, 2023]\n“We have our warfare tactics instructors involved in analyzing the data that we’re getting from the tapes on the Carney and the other ships,” he said. “And we’re looking very closely at profiles and what we have to do when it comes to radar tuning. And what we have to do when it comes to setting up our weapons system on the ship to make sure that we have … maximum defensive capability at all times.”\nThe fleet is also\nwrestling with the cost differential of shooting down cheap drones and crude, Iranian-made anti-ship cruise or ballistic missiles with the expensive systems outfitted on destroyers.\n“This is a mix we haven’t seen before, and it does represent a new wrinkle,” retired Vice. Adm. Robert Murrett, head of the Institute for Security Policy and Law at Syracuse University, told Military Times.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I recently got my mom to use this and she loves it too she said it makes her skin look tighter and lowers the appearance of wrinkles.\" —\nJaclyn B.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$15.92+ (available in two sizes).\n2. Some\ncallus remover to eliminate the hard skin on your hooves (ahem, :::clears throat::: feet) if you're too terrified to face the glorified cheese grater at your local salon.\nPromising review: \"OMG!! I HAD horrible feet! They were hard and nothing seemed to work until I tried this. I have tried so many different products that I actually thought it was impossible to remove the thick skin. When I saw this product and read some of the reviews... I decided to try it. I put this callus remover on for about 20 minutes (the instructions say 5-10 minutes but my feet were so AWFUL that I decided to double the max recommended time lol)... then I scrubbed them with a\npumice stone. All of the gross hard skin came off... I could not believe it! When I tell you, it felt like I had new feet, I mean that!!\" — Sheena\nGet it from Amazon for\n$14.99.\n3. A\nWet & Forget weekly cleaner you can spritz on your shower walls and tub after you're done cleaning yourself. Leave it on overnight — no scrubbing necessary — and just wash it off the next time you're in the shower!\nPromising review: \"I never write product reviews, but this product was so amazing that I had to. We have hard water making the soap scum build up in our shower impossible to scrub away. I have tried every cleaning product there is and spent hours scrubbing and trying to clean our shower. This product arrived today and I immediately sprayed it on. It set for about 8 hours and then I went to start scrubbing. I barely had to scrub and my shower is spotless!! AMAZING!!\" —\nRobyn Smith\nGet it from Amazon for\n$20.98+ (available in two scents and various sizes).\n4. An\nindoor insect trap that can contend with mosquitoes, gnats, moths, and fruit flies because if they're not eating you alive, they're messing with your plants and produce and you won't stand for it!!!!\nPromising review: \"We have had an ongoing issue with drugstore beetles for the past 9 months. Nothing we did resolved it, in spite of thorough cleaning, removal of all possible food sources, and clearing every potential site we could think of for eggs. Getting rid of them seemed almost impossible, as they do not respond to most insecticides, and can survive temperatures below freezing. We were at a loss. This bug catcher has been a massive help. It sucks up any little bug that gets near it. It is quiet, low maintenance, and easy to change when you need a new glue sheet.\" —\nTegan A Beechey\nGet it from Amazon for\n$39.99 (available in two colors).\n5. A\nportable car vacuum if your toddler's favorite game is to throw their Cheerios all over the backseat and then grind them into the cushions and floorboards on their way out of the car. 🙃\nPromising review: \"This item is perfect. As a busy wife and mom it is nearly impossible to keep my vehicle clean. This portable vacuum makes it much easier. It’s so convenient to have on hand and clean up crumbs 'as they fall' lol. My husband likes it so much that he ordered one for his vehicle.\" —\nChristian Love\nGet it from Amazon for\n$29.99+ (available in three colors/configurations).\n6. A tub of\nThe Pink Stuff that can clean anything you throw at it be that tires, pots and pans, stove tops, showers, or the sticky White Claw patch in your kitchen.\nCheck it out on TikTok\nhere!\nAnd here's what BuzzFeeder/The Pink Stuff fan\nHeather Braga has to say:\n\"After hearing what incredible things The Pink Stuff can do, I finally ordered it and tried it for myself. Honestly, wow! It really does work wonders. I tried it first on my Le Creuset cast-iron pan and really was amazed at how just one pass with The Pink Stuff (and a\nscouring brush) took off almost every stain! I can't wait to try it on literally everything in my home that needs a deep cleaning.\"\nPromising review: \"I have an acrylic shower pan with a textured surface that has proven impossible to clean. The Pink Stuff finally did the job with a little elbow grease. This will be a staple in my cleaning products.\" —\nBetty Parsons\nGet it from Amazon for\n$4.99.\n7. An\n ~instant~ carpet spot remover you can rely on to get your space back in shape after you accidentally trip while holding a whole bowl of queso. (It happens to the best of us.)\nPromising review: “I have tried many stain removers over the years and this is by far the best one. It has removed stains left behind by other products; stains I really thought were impossible to clean. Have been using this for several years and intend to stick with it. Definitely recommend.\" —\nPat H.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$6.65.\n8. A\nwinged eyeliner stamp for those who LOVE the look of winged liner, but can't help but shake like a leaf when attempting to paint them on. Now, you can stamp 'em on and call it a day.\nCheck it out in action on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@jadequijano_/video/7040467026170924335!\nPromising review: \"This is the best invention EVER! I have a scar at the corner of my eye that made applying liquid liner impossible because of the uneven surface. This stamp goes right over the scar perfectly and I have perfect winged liner in seconds! Truly amazing. I'll be using this forever!\" —\nChristine\nGet a set of two from Amazon for\n$14.97 (available in three styles).\n9. A\npack of K-Cup cleaning pods that are basically like a full-body tune-up for your coffee maker. Just look at the nasty stuff it flushes out!\nPromising review: \"My Keurig had started to sputter and trying to get 10oz out of it was becoming impossible. I was having to run water through it before every cup just to get a full cup. I got these and used them immediately. What a difference!!!! My Keurig is like I just took it out of the box. I cannot recommend these enough.\" —\nRoger\nGet a pack of six from Amazon for\n$9.45.\n10. A\nbeard straightener if oils and balms have proven insufficient in your efforts to tame your facial hair. This lil' tool has three heat settings, reaches your desired temp in just 30 seconds, and reduces frizz as it works.\nPromising review: \"My beard hair is coarse and wavy. I have tried\nboar bristle brushes and an ungodly amount of beard balms and oils to get my beard to lay straight. Then along comes this straightener. IT WORKS! Heats up fast, and is very effective. The digital readout makes it easy to choose a precise temperature. Even just one use keeps my beard looking straight for a couple of days. Daily use seems to keep it looking like I had a barber trim every day. I used to stop my beard from growing beyond a certain length because it would curl up and was impossible to get the look that I wanted. Now my beard looks exactly as I always wanted it to.\" — Keerthan Krishnan\nGet it from Amazon for\n$23.65+ (available in two models).\n11. A\nChomChom roller — a MUST for any pet parent — ready to put your regular old lint roller to shame. Forget ripping off sheets till you run out — this collects everything in a neat little compartment you simply empty out.\nHere's what BuzzFeeder\nJenae Sitzes has to say:\n\"I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, but I took the photos above literally just now to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller — at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside, which does require you to apply a bit of pressure.\"\nPromising review: \"I was skeptical that this would would work. I have two cats and a dog. Cleaning hair off clothing and furniture is near impossible. But this really works. Black pants... fur free. Couch... fur free. It's amazing. Even the cat tower looks clean. Works on the rug, too. I got carried away and de-furred my whole living room. Next is the bedroom.\" —\nA Jenkins.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$24.99 (available in three colors).\n12. An\nenzyme-based stain spray capable of taking on the *peskiest* stains from grass and mud to wine and even cosmetics. If you've ever gotten a drop of foundation on your clothes, you know what a big deal that last one is! Puracy is a small, family-owned business dedicated to creating natural and organic formulas that are not only effective but safe for kids and pets. Aside from food stains, this spray also does a number on all other miscellaneous spots in your life like wine, coffee, makeup, and period blood!\nPromising review: \"I was reluctant to purchase a 'natural' stain remover, and I was surprised how great it works on ALL types of stains. My husband is a Greens Keeper on our local golf course. Needless to say, he comes home with a huge variety of nearly impossible-to-get-out stains on his clothes; from grease to grass stains, and everything in between. So, far, I have not had a stain that the Puracy stain remover (applied with a toothbrush) cannot tackle. It beats all the commercial stain removers, and I’ve tried them all. It also removes chocolate, blood, and tomato stains. One of the best cleaning products I’ve used.\" —\nDee Marie\nGet it from\nPuracy on Amazon for $7.99+ (available in various sizes and with or without a cleaning cloth).\n13. A\ntube of silicone grout whitener if you're dealing with mold and mildew that will. not. go. away. no matter how much you clean it.\nThe gel formula is safe to use on/around windows, sinks and baths, shower-heads, pools, tiles, silicone sealant, and more. Leave it on the area you're looking to clean for six to eight hours (no scrubbing required). Some reviewers with really bad mold/mildew note that leaving it on for longer and/or doing a second round of cleaning made a huge difference!\nPromising review: \"We bought this as a last ditch effort to clean a shower that seemed impossible to clean. We were seriously on the verge of just remodeling the bathroom to fix the problem. But this little bottle cleaned up every nook and cranny that we thought were done for. So very impressed, and we will be ordering more!\" —\nAlex Hawman\nGet it from Amazon for\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B076KS1VYQ?tag=bfchelsea-20&ascsubtag=7577674%2C13%2C38%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0.\n14. An\nAngry Mama microwave cleaner that, once filled with water and a dash of vinegar, will steam clean the grimiest of appliances. Hot Pocket grease, butter splatters, and burnt popcorn smells are no match for her.\nPromising review: \"The Angry Mama did the impossible. I used it to clean an impossibly dirty, caked, hasn't-been-cleaned-for-years work microwave. Even though I had trouble taking it apart and putting it together during the first use, this lil' Mama did her job to a T. Years of hardened and re-microwaved gunk released their foul grasp from the walls of the microwave and were wiped clean. The microwave looks almost new. I couldn't believe it.\" —\nChelsie Sanchez\nGet it from Amazon for\n$6.99+ (available in different sizes and packs of one or two).\n15. A\nfull-body bath pillow so you can roll off of your regular mattress and onto your submerged mattress.\nPromising review: \"I love this thing so much. I have a standard tub/shower that is impossible to be comfortable in. This mat made my bath usable again! The quality of this thing is great and it has a little loop for easy hanging. I now I have to set a timer to remind myself to get out the bath. I could sleep in it now.\" —\nAutumn White\nGet it from Amazon for\n$47.02+ (available in two styles and colors).\n16. A\nfoot peeling mask that's SO effective, the before and after photos will both give you nightmares and earn a spot on your vision board.\nIf\nfoot graters give you the heebie-jeebies (hi, hello, it's me!), try these instead. Just slip on the booties for one hour, wash away the leftover solution, and then wait patiently as it takes 7–14 days before your feet shed like a freakin' iguana. At the end, you'll be left with moisturized, baby-soft tootsies!\nPromising review: \"I have tried other foot peels but the completeness of this peel is gratifying! Results started in three days and at 10 days, it is nearly done. My husband did the mask the same day — I thought his heels were impossible, but the callouses keep peeling more each day!\" —\nConnie Schmidt\nGet it from Amazon for\n $12.99+ (available in five scents).\n17. Some\n Bissell Stomp 'N Go pads capable of lifting whatever nasty stain your pet left you on your new area rug. Whether you're picking up slobber, mud, or an \"accident\" (let's be real — it was just raining and they didn't want to go outside) your fingers don't have to get anywhere near the mess — just throw on a house show, toss the pad on top of the stain, and give it a good ol' stomp.\nPromising review: \"I am FURIOUS at how great these things worked. FUMING. What sorcery is this? What kind of magic was cast? What spell was spoken? How...how do these things DO THIS. Now I have to cover my whole house! This... was impossible to remove prior. Every 👏🏻Single👏🏻Cleaner👏🏻Has👏🏻Been👏🏻Tried👏🏻 Then these little babies…they come in and swoop up every ounce of elbow grease and every tear I have poured into these SPOTS. IN SECONDS. Son of a..there goes my life savings. Everyone..put your stocks into Bissell..\" —\nKathy Prentkowski\nGet a pack of 20 from Amazon for\n$27.49.\n18. An\nAngry Orange pet odor eliminator if you precious wittle baby is literally PERFECT except for the fact that they treat your area rug like a pee pad.\nPromising review: \"This is very powerful which I love because trying to get rid of the smell of cat urine is nearly impossible. The scent is pleasing and the product does a good job of getting rid of stains also. A little goes a long way, so I don't use too much — just two or three sprays and it's enough to cover the area. Plus, it deters my cat from spraying on furniture and I haven't had any problems since.\" —\nAmazon Customer\nGet it from Amazon for\n$19.97.\n19. A\nConair fabric defuzzer powerful enough to remove pills and matted fibers from your sofa (and even clothes) but gentle enough that no damage is left in its wake.\nThe battery-operated model requires two AA batteries that aren't included, but you can buy some right\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNV8E0C?tag=bfchelsea-20&ascsubtag=7577674%2C19%2C38%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0!\nPromising review: \"I don't know how I lived without this fabric defuzzer all my life! It is fast and leaves clean fabric. I have a hoodie that came out of the wash full of pilling a couple of washes ago. It is my favorite hoodie, because it was my son's senior hoodie, and I lost him eight months ago without warning. Picking the pilling off was an impossible task but this Conair fabric defuzzer had it spotless in about five minutes.\" —\nLeslie J.

A\nTubShroom so you don't have to worry about a wig's worth of hair accumulating in your drain every week.\nThis fits any standard 1.5-inch tub drain or bathroom sink drain. But, if you want to keep your hair catching separate between your tub and sink, then treat yourself and your home to the\nSinkShroom!\nPromising review: \"Does exactly what it claims. With three long-haired women in the house, keeping hair out of the drains was impossible.

Be warned, though: Reviewers say once you start, you won't stop.\nPromising review: \"Uhhhhhhmazing! I had to instantly use this product when I got home just because I've been so anxious with ordering it. But I am really impressed. We have a new puppy and a German Shepherd adult so keeping my carpet clean is almost impossible. I've already cleaned my stairs and bedroom and I have plenty more areas I wanna try it on!\" —\nBrittany\nGet it from Amazon for\n$109.59+ (available in nine configurations).\n23. A\ngooseneck tablet and phone stand you can hook up to your bed frame or nightstand so you can mindlessly scroll TikTok — look, Ma, no hands! — while Netflix also plays in the background. 😈\nPromising review: \"My girlfriend and I will occasionally watch a show/movie on our\nKindle Fire before going to bed, and holding the Kindle while trying to fall asleep was obviously impossible. This holder attachment has been the perfect solution! The clamp expands to a surprisingly large distance, and I had no problem clipping to the headboard of our bed. Really happy with this purchase!\" — Jim H.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$22.99+ (available in black and white).\n24. A\nSwitchBot button pusher you can install over any light switch or button-activated device so you can turn everything you own into a smart device. That way, when you're seven hours deep into a Love Island marathon and you literally couldn't be more comfy, you can turn off your lights or turn on your fan — via Alexa, Google Home, or an app on your phone — without having to get out of bed.\nReviewers love this because it doesn't require you to \"smart enable\" other parts of your home. It's also a great way to turn on your kettle or coffee brewer from the other room so it's ready for you when you get out of bed!\nPromising review: \"Solved an impossible problem for me. The wild wiring in the house I’m staying in prevents me from using an in-wall electrical smart switch, so I ordered this with a lack of any other options, and it works amazingly well. It’s worked to control a light switch without fail for the past two months. Yes, you’ll need the hub to work with\nAlexa, but it’s not that expensive and the ecosystem for this company is actually really nice. I ended up buying a bunch more of their stuff and it’s all been great.\" — David V\nGet it from Amazon for\n$29+ (available in white and black).\n25.

A six-pack of\nwashing machine cleaner tablets so leftover dirt, residue, and musty odors don't affix themselves to your laundry and make it even dirtier than when it went in.\nPromising review: \"I bought two of these products; one for a clothes washer, and\nanother for my dishwasher.

A\npair of *affordable* down-alternative cooling pillows if you're a particularly sweaty sleeper.\nPromising review: \"As someone who has had migraines for many years, these pillows have been life changing. My migraines always start in my neck, and finding pillows that don't aggravate my neck has been impossible. Until now. Before I started using these pillows, I would wake up many times a night, because my neck would get stiff and sore. I was never getting a solid, peaceful rest. The very first night that I started using these pillows, I got a full night's sleep, without tossing and turning and readjusting my pillow. I've been using them for two months now, and I haven't woken up with a migraine once.\" —\nDaniel K. Vallus\nGet a set of two from Amazon for\n$60.91+ (and clip the coupon for 40% off!).\n29.

It also comes with an adhesive strip so installation is easy peasy.\nPromising review: \"This is a great product. Every year during the warmer months, we have to deal with flies getting in our trash can and then we would have maggots in our trash can that are impossible to get rid of, not to mention how disgusting! We attach to this to the top of the trash can lid and no more disgusting problems. Just make sure the small device doesn't fall off into your trash, or you'll be wishing you had bought more than one.

This is STRONG so if you have sensitive skin, the manufacturer suggests you do a spot test first.\nPromising review: \"I had been trying to find a product that would help with sweating and keeping dry while going through menopause. Keeping embarrassing sweating down was impossible. I must have purchased 6 different products and aside from being expensive, nothing seemed to both eliminate sweat and stop odor. I was watching Rachael Ray one morning and the show was about remedies that worked. SweatBlock was mentioned so I became curious. SweatBlock really worked. It was affordable and I have raved to my other menopause friends. They too are now happy, dry, and satisfied customers.\" —\nMs. Dry/Confident\nGet a pack of 10 from Amazon for\n$19.99.\n31.

I have a Korat mix cat with short hair that's impossible to groom with a brush. I've tried all kinds of combs and brushes and nothing has worked well on him. I took this out of the package, I showed it to him and let him sniff it, and then pet him with it. This thing is awesome! With just a few strokes I removed a ton of cat hair.

A handy dandy\nwad preventer to ensure your sheets don't tangle themselves up into a Boy Scout badge–worthy knot *and* not even get clean in the process. Wad-Free is a small biz from Cyndi Bray. Their products are made in the USA. Just pop the corners of your flat or fitted sheet into the device, and you'll never have to deal with tangling and twisting again! Believe it or not (I mean believe it...the reviews are there), the manufacturer even says that your sheets will dry 75% faster and with fewer wrinkles.\nPromising review: \"Who knew I needed this.

A\nfur-eliminating broom capable of squeegeeing enough fur from your carpet that if magically animated — you know, like those brooms in Fantasia — it would transform into a Pekingese.\nPromising review: \"I have a giant Saint Bernard who sheds constantly no matter how much I brush her. My carpet was covered with fur, and I felt so overwhelmed with how impossible it was to get clean. I actually feel like my carpet is clean now! I rake about once a day just to keep up with all the fur she sheds. I definitely recommend this for dog owners. It also helps bring life back into carpet that got matted down by heavy furniture or in walkways.

No more readjusting every five minutes so all parts of your body can experience what it's like to actually be underwater!\nPromising review: \"I have an older bathtub and found it impossible to get a nice relaxing bath without the overflow safety decreasing the water level to a less than enjoyable amount. Enter this handle little gizmo. It works perfectly. Allows me to fill the tub to a nice amount but still has a safety in place so as to not completely overflow.
