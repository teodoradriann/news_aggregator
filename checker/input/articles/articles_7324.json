During this visit, the two men discussed the war with Russia and their bilateral relations. The Turkish president said he was ready to host a “peace summit” and work on relaunching a secure corridor in the Black Sea. But this will depend above all on the goodwill of Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a press conference in Istanbul, March 8, 2024. © Umit Bektas / Reuters By: RFI Follow Advertisement Read more With our correspondent in Istanbul, With our correspondent in Istanbul, Anne Andlauer Proposing only initiatives that include Russia has, for two years, been a constant in Turkish diplomacy, which strives to play an intermediary role between kyiv and Moscow. Thus, while Volodymyr Zelensky informed him of the preparations for an upcoming peace summit in Switzerland from which Russia will be absent, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was ready to host a Russia-Ukraine summit in Turkey for peace negotiations. . The Turkish head of state hoped to obtain \" certain results \" on prisoner exchanges and security in the Black Sea, noting \" positive approaches \" in his country's exchanges with the two belligerents. Tayyip Erdogan hopes in particular to convince Russia to relaunch the agreement on a secure corridor in the Black Sea, which would guarantee the transit of commercial ships. Cooperate on defense This agreement, which brought together Ukraine and Russia under the aegis of the UN, allowed Ukraine to export nearly 33 million tonnes of cereals . It became inoperative when Moscow withdrew from it a year later. Since then, kyiv has used an alternative route along the Bulgarian and Romanian coasts, but Turkey believes that a mechanism excluding Russia cannot be viable in the more or less long term. Volodymyr Zelensky's visit was also devoted to Turkish-Ukrainian defense cooperation. Without going into details, the Ukrainian president announced that the two countries had agreed on joint projects, both at the governmental level and between their defense industries. In Istanbul, Volodymyr Zelensky visited a shipyard where Turkish corvettes are being built for the Ukrainian navy.

    "text": "Matthew Stevenson is the lead pastor of All Nations Chicago, a charismatic church that emphasizes the 5-fold ministry.” Stevenson’s bio describes him as a “global influencer, culturalist and visionary, violently raised up by God during this complex moment in history” whose ministry is “earmarked by powerful preaching, bold delivery and unusual supernatural activity.”\nClaiming to be “Intensely gifted in the prophetic” whereby “thousands around the world have been dramatically impacted by his very timely, direct, and specific prophetic words,” he reveals he is “an apostolic leader with the Father’s heart entrenched in his life.”\nAs some have already identified, he’s also preaching and teaching some very, very bad things.\nDuring a Jan 24, 2023 sermon, Stevenson preached the importance of having a robust prayer life, including the need to be in prayer throughout the day, because their lack of prayer reflects their circumstances. He insists a lack of prayer explains why their boss is getting on their nerves, why their child is not acting right, or why their relationship has no peace.\nHe claims the Lord has revealed to him that some in his congregations are slaves to the booty call, likening it to a demon that must be bound and cast out.\n“In the name of Jesus get rid of the booty call!” Come on will you help me real quick?…Slap somebody and say “break the booty call, break the booty call!” I give you permission right now, tell ’em “in the name of Jesus, I take authority over the booty call.”\nI know what I heard by the spirit of God, break the booty call!”",

    "text": "2024-08-30 15:14:31\nL’étoile filante espagnole Carlos Alcaraz est inopinément ralentie dans sa quête de la première place du classement mondial. Il a perdu contre le Néerlandais Botic van de Zandschulp, qui a récemment perdu contre un Suisse inconnu lors du tournoi Challenger de Zoug.\nC’était frappant : Carlos Alcaraz a perdu au deuxième tour de l’US Open. Imago / Robert Deutsch / www.imago-images.de\nL’US Open a débuté récemment comme la plupart des tournois du Grand Chelem : les favoris ont gagné, les Suisses ont perdu. Le trio suisse (Stan Wawrinka, Viktorija Golubic, Dominic Stricker) a été éliminé dès le premier tour.\nLa première nouvelle inattendue en provenance de New York est arrivée vendredi soir : Carlos Alcaraz, l’étoile filante espagnole, a dû faire ses adieux après le deuxième tour. Le vainqueur de l’US Open 2022 a été battu par le Néerlandais Botic van de Zandschulp en trois sets (1:6, 5:7, 4:6). Alcaraz avait déjà remporté 15 matchs consécutifs lors de tournois majeurs, ce qui lui avait valu les titres de Roland Garros et de Wimbledon. Van de Zandschulp, 74e au classement mondial, a surpris le favori en recherchant dès le début l’offensive.\nL’échec d’Alcaraz donne une autre chance à Djokovic Pour van de Zandschulp, cette victoire est le plus grand succès de sa carrière. Lors de l’entretien sur le terrain après le match, il a déclaré : « Je suis à court de mots en ce moment. Pour moi, ce fut une soirée incroyable. C’était la première fois que je jouais en soirée et le public était fantastique. A 28 ans, il est tout sauf un nouveau venu sur le circuit. Il est entraîné par Sven Groeneveld, qui est l’un des entraîneurs les plus établis de la scène et qui, pour le compte de Swiss Tennis, a accompagné pendant quelques mois le jeune Roger Federer dans son chemin vers la classe mondiale.\nLes traces laissées jusqu’à présent par van de Zandschulp sur le circuit ATP étaient gérables. Il était autrefois numéro 22 au classement, mais il n’a encore remporté aucun titre. Il y a quelques semaines, il a perdu contre le Suisse Mika Brunold (ATP 453) au premier tour du tournoi Challenger de Zoug. A New York, van de Zandschulp avait déjà impressionné lors de sa victoire au premier tour contre Denis Shapovalov. Ce succès lui a donné beaucoup de confiance en lui, a déclaré le Néerlandais.\nCarlos Alcaraz a échoué au deuxième tour d’un tournoi majeur pour la première fois depuis le tournoi de Wimbledon 2022. En 2022, il a remporté quatre titres du Grand Chelem. Vendredi soir, cependant, il a joué de manière inhabituellement incorrecte. Il a commis 27 fautes dites « directes », dont 12 avec son coup droit, qui est en fait sa grande force. Il n’a réussi aucun coup gagnant dans le premier set. Après 2h19, le match était perdu.\nLe prochain adversaire de Van de Zandschulp est le Britannique Jack Draper, numéro 25 au classement. Alcaraz, en revanche, subit un revers dans son retour ciblé au sommet du classement mondial. Néanmoins, sa saison est exceptionnelle. Il a remporté 39 des 48 matchs et a également remporté le tournoi Masters 1000 à Indian Wells. Aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris, Alcaraz a remporté l’argent après avoir perdu en finale contre Novak Djokovic.\nL’échec d’Alcaraz à New York donne désormais une autre chance à Djokovic. Le Serbe, aujourd’hui âgé de 37 ans, se rapproche de son prochain grand objectif, le 25e titre majeur et unique record du Grand Chelem. Il disputera son troisième match à New York samedi soir contre l’Australien Alexei Popyrin (ATP 28).\nLes pécheurs gardent leur sang-froid ? A l’US Open, beaucoup de choses s’opposent entre Djokovic et l’Italien Jannik Sinner. Mais le numéro un mondial originaire du Tyrol du Sud a eu des problèmes de nerfs à New York. Sinner a connu une période particulièrement difficile au premier tour face à l’Américain Mackenzie McDonald (ATP 140). Après tout : lors du deuxième match contre Alex Michelsen (ATP 49), il s’est amélioré et n’a eu besoin que d’un peu moins de cent minutes pour remporter sa victoire en trois sets.\nLa question qui entoure Sinner est la suivante : ses nerfs tiendront-ils le coup ? Son affaire de dopage, rendue publique la semaine dernière, le dérange visiblement toujours. Sinner a été testé positif à deux reprises au stéroïde Clostebol au printemps. Mais un tribunal indépendant l’a acquitté de toute culpabilité. La substance interdite serait entrée dans son sang par les mains de son physiothérapeute. Le thérapeute aurait ingéré la substance alors qu’il soignait une coupure à l’un de ses doigts.\nLa raison a suscité un certain scepticisme sur la scène du tennis et parmi les concurrents de Sinner. Est-ce protéger un joueur trop important pour être sanctionné ?\nNovak Djokovic a choisi des mots étonnamment ouverts lors de sa conférence de presse avant l’US Open : « Je comprends la colère de ses concurrents. Certains se demandent si les mêmes normes s’appliquent à tout le monde. Il y a des joueurs qui sont dans une situation similaire. L’issue d’une telle procédure ne devrait pas dépendre de la question de savoir si l’on dispose de suffisamment d’argent pour pouvoir s’offrir de bons conseils juridiques.»\nCe que dit Novak Djokovic à propos de l’affaire de dopage de Jannik Sinner. Youtube\nDjokovic s’est exprimé non seulement en tant que concurrent de Sinner, mais également en tant que président de la Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), une organisation concurrente de l’ATP, qu’il a fondée en 2019 avec le Canadien Vasek Pospisil. La PTPA s’engage à protéger les joueurs les moins privilégiés.\nL’affaire du dopage met évidemment beaucoup de pression sur Sinner. Avant le début de l’US Open, il a apporté des changements à son équipe de soutien de longue date. La défaite d’Alcaraz le rend désormais temporairement flou. Mais l’affaire n’est peut-être pas terminée pour lui.\n#Van #Zandschulp #bat #Alcaraz\n1725022143",

    "text": "News I Love My Stanley Cup—But No, I Won’t be Fighting Anyone for a Limited-Edition Color The Stanley craze has taken over the lives of parents, tweens, and teens. By Zara Hanawalt Updated on January 5, 2024 Fact checked by Sarah Scott Trending Videos Target/Stanley I spent the first few years of motherhood in a perpetual state of dehydration. Okay, fine. That’s a little dramatic, but I remember thinking to myself multiple times “I’m definitely not drinking enough water.” In the earliest days of motherhood, I was constantly hunkered down nursing twins (as anyone who has ever breastfed premature multiples will tell you, it’s pretty much a round-the-clock commitment, with few breaks in between feedings). I’d fill up a glass of water every morning, but inevitably I’d take the whole glass down and not be able to go refill it as needed in between feeding two infants. Drinking enough water remains a challenge even as the days of constant nursing faded away: I can’t tell you how many times one of my kids has thrown a toy into my water glass, or taken a sip from my cup and spewed backwash into it (lovely!) or knocked over a glass I’d just filled. Eventually, I decided to give in to the hype and do the thing multiple influencers told me would change my life: I bought myself a Stanley cup. If you haven’t checked TikTok in a while and are unfamiliar, no, this particular Stanley cup has nothing to do with hockey. It’s essentially a water tumbler with a straw. It comes in multiple sizes, though the massive 40-ounce version is arguably the most popular iteration. It holds a ton of water, has a lid, and is easy to drink from its attached straw…and yes, it has solved a lot of my hydration problems. The Stanley tumbler has become something of a must-have accessory. Chalk this up to the item’s wild social media popularity, as well as its wide color selection. Stanley cups are, for lack of a better word, cute, and the range of colors, (combined with the exclusivity of many of these colors), gives them a real cool factor. That cool factor was on full display recently as Target rolled out a limited-edition Valentine’s Day-inspired collection…and caused total pandemonium at one Arizona store. A TikTok clip captured the scene at the store, where the tumblers reportedly sold out in just four minutes. Of course, that’s just one store; I imagine something similar happened at many, many Target locations immediately after they rolled out these products. The History of Stanley The Stanley brand has been around since 1913. Inventor William Stanley, Jr. fused vacuum insulation with steel to create a portable bottle that could keep drinks hot. The thermos became a staple of the outdoors and the workday. Now the company boasts a whole line of products to keep your drinks both hot and cold. Are Stanleys Worth The Hype? Look, as a busy mom, I get the appeal. I use mine all the time — for all the reasons I shared above, plus many more, it really does help me drink more water. I love that, thanks to its tapered design, I can still fit my 40-ounce Stanley in my car’s cup holder, which is perfect for days when I’m shuttling my kids around to multiple activities or running errands. I love the easy-to-grasp handle on my cup, which makes one-handed drinking while I’m holding a sick kid, working on my computer, or driving somewhere a breeze. I love that I don’t have to mess with a screw-top or a lid or even a flip straw when I want a drink of water in the middle of the night. I love that it keeps my water nice and cold all day long. And okay, I’ll admit it: I love the cute color offerings and look of my cup…the aesthetic value is one of those things that doesn’t really matter, but also…kind of matters when it comes to the overall enjoyment of a product. But I can also concede that the Stanley trend has gotten a little out of hand. Multiple influencers have showcased their collections of Stanleys—which is fine, they’re entitled to spend their money the way they choose to. But the hype also feels…a little unnecessary. A dad shared a video of himself and his daughter camping out all night in 40-degree weather to get a pink cup from their local Target…and shared an image of a long line forming before the store opened. It’s the type of hype you’d expect from, say, a big, new iPhone release. Or Cabbage Patch Kids for those of us who remember those lines in the 80s. But it’s for a water cup, one you can get your hands on with relative ease if you’re willing to compromise on the color. Then again, if you don’t get the Stanley cup color of your choosing from the source, you may have to pay a large markup in order to buy it from a reseller…as the kids would say “it’s giving” Eras Tour ticket vibes. Speaking of the kids, they’re driving this trend too. Teens and tweens seem to actually be in agreement with their moms on this one. They're the biggest Stanley enthusiasts out there, as evidenced by the incredible amount of TikTok content around this cult-favorite item. It was one of the hottest gifts of the 2023 holiday season. In one TikTok with nearly 24 million views, a little girl starts crying when she opens her Stanley. In a sweet moment, she hugs and thanks her parents so appreciatively. There are so many videos like this on social media. My own five-year-old has asked for a Stanley to match mommy’s, and ultimately we decided the type of cup I have is too big and heavy for her little hands—but if she wants one in a few years, I think I’ll view it as a harmless ask (and a way to get her drinking more water, to boot!) and indulge it. If she asks for an entire collection of Stanley cups, though? That’s where I’ll draw the line. The Trend of Over-Consumption No one needs a whole cabinet full of water tumblers, after all. Ultimately, the people on social media who showcase their Stanley collections aren’t doing anything terribly harmful, but they are setting a standard of over-consumption, which feels par for the course on social media. In the grand scheme of TikTok trends, though this one is fairly benign, at least in my opinion. Over-consumption aside, I also don’t love that dads are poking fun at women and girls loving these cups. (Although somewhat amusing.) After all, no one shames men for collecting baseball cards or beer cans or rare coins or whatever it is men are collecting these days. Yet when women or girls want to get their hands on something, that thing is automatically deemed frivolous and silly, and their desire to have it is viewed as indulgent or “cringe”. At the end of the day, I get (some of) the hype. My Stanley (okay, fine—my two Stanleys) have made staying hydrated easier, more convenient, and more fun. As a mom, I know how hard it can be to splurge or do something for yourself—so I also love the idea of this type of low-stakes purchase that can make life a little easier and a little more exciting for moms. And yes, I realize it’s slightly ridiculous to think of a water cup as something that can “spark joy”, so to speak, but it is what it is. The bottom line? I like my Stanley a lot. It didn’t change my life, but I think it’s a great product for “mom life” and ultimately I’ve got to hand it to the brand for designing a good product and taking it up a notch to really appeal to female consumers. It’s an effective business strategy if I’ve ever seen one. Does anyone need a whole collection of this thing? No, of course not. But should we be shaming or judging parents who want to buy themselves a few Stanleys, or camp out with their kids to get their hands on this trendy item? Also no. At the end of the day, it’s just not that serious…and that’s more than we can say for a lot of other social media fads. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why! Other Submit",

The Kremlin has previously dismissed reports about the North's troop deployment as \"fake news\". But Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that it was Moscow's business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang. Putin did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia. \"The first units of the military from the DPRK, which were trained at the eastern Russian training grounds, have already arrived in the combat zone of the Russian-Ukrainian war. In particular, on October 23, 2024, their presence was recorded in the Kursk region,\" the Ukrainian intelligence agency said in a statement. It said a total of around 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia, and training was taking place on five military bases.",
