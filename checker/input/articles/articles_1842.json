    "title": "A cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock to perform at Cranbrook",
    "text": "Sweet Honey in the Rock, an a cappella vocal group, coming to Cranbrook this weekend Duante Beddingfield Detroit Free Press Internationally renowned, Grammy-nominated African American vocal ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a stop in Detroit on Saturday, April 20. The 7 p.m. performance serves as The Cranbrook Project’s annual Sacred Jazz Concert, held at Christ Church Cranbrook, 470 Church Road in Bloomfield Hills.\nThe a cappella vocal quartet has spent decades touring the globe with musical messages of positivity, love and social consciousness. Their activism will be on full display during the Sacred Concert, which celebrates the intersection between jazz and worship music.\nCarol Maillard is one of the group’s founding members and, despite a few years’ absence, has remained with Sweet Honey for more than 30 years.\n“We are coming with a show that we have put together for our 50th anniversary offerings,” said Maillard. “There are so many songs, and so many stories, and we don’t have time to do them all, but we have tried to pick from our a cappella repertoire — some of the older songs, the topical songs and some of the new things that we do with our bass player who’s been traveling with us since 2014.”\nShe spoke of the craftsmanship it’s taken over the years to hone the group’s repertoire.\n“We focus on making sure that we’re presenting songs that mean something very deeply to us,” she said, “so (audience members) find meaning for their own lives in some of the songs that we sing. And we know every song doesn’t hit every person; every melody doesn’t ring true for everybody. But we know in a Sweet Honey experience, there’s something for everyone … it’s going to touch somebody, somebody’s going to hear themselves in a song. One song could mean one thing on one day, and something else comes up and you pull that song out of the repertoire because it refers to another situation or emotion.\n“The songs are alive. What Sweet Honey does is organic. It’s true. It’s a living energy. Sometimes we think things are going to go one way, and The Spirit says, ‘I think this song, this time, this place, the audience members need this.’ And we listen. And we offer.”\nMaillard said when it comes to a live Sweet Honey concert, audience members take away as much as they put into the experience.\n“Are you going to sing along when someone asks you to sing along? Are you going to sing your part? Are you going to let yourself be free enough to clap? Are you going to say, ‘Yes, Lord! I hear you! Amen!’ Are you going to talk back if you need to, dance, let something out or cry? Or let some emotion through, even if it’s anger about the way things are in this world right now?\n“Come, and leave feeling better than you did when you got there. And give us some energy back, too, because we do feed off the audience. We love it when people talk back, and we love when people bring their babies and we’re singing with the babies in the background, and we say, ‘That’s right, baby! You know what’s going on!’ We really feel like it’s a conversation with our audiences because people are feeling so much, so deeply.”\nTickets for Sacred Concert 2024 are available for purchase at www.ccc-info.org/sacred and start at $45.\nContact Free Press arts and culture reporter Duante Beddingfield at dbeddingfield@freepress.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "Lukas McClish was rescued Thursday evening with no major injuries after wandering Big Basin Redwoods State Park for 10 days, telling KSBW News that he had left home on the morning of June 11 and \"didn’t bring anything, because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work.\" McClish said that after he realized he was lost \"I kind of just hiked each day. I’d go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall and sit down by the waterfall and drink water out of my boot,\" adding that he also foraged wild berries. He said that what he wanted the most was a burrito and a taco bowl, telling KSBW, \"That’s what I thought about every day after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.\" Experts say that getting lost without food or supplies can quickly become a question of survival, and that trying to find help should be the first priority, as well as proper preparation before setting out on even a short hike. \"Use any available resources to signal for rescue significantly increasing your chances of making it through,\" Trail Hiking Australia founder Darren Edwards told The Washington Post in an email. He added that \"beyond help seeking and making your location known, the priorities become shelter, water and food [not always in that order].\" The National Park Service stressed that preparation before a hike should include leaving details about your trip with friends or family, where you will be hiking, your contact information, when you plan to arrive and return, and who is coming with you. In addition, it is best to bring a personal locater beacon that can send a distress signal, along with a fully charged cellphone.",

    "text": "19/02/2025 / Exitosa Noticias / Mundo / Actualizado al 19/02/2025\nEl Papa Francisco atraviesa un cuadro \"complejo\" de salud. Este hecho se conoció luego de que los médicos le detectaran una neumonía bilateral que pone en riesgo su vida. Ante ello, se viene especulando quién sería el posible sucesor del sumo pontífice si una situación crítica se presenta.\n¿Quién podría suceder al Papa Francisco?\nAnte la posibilidad de que el estado de salud del Papa Francisco empeore hasta llegar al punto de la muerte, circulan fuertes rumores relacionados a quién podría ser el encargado de sucederlo. En un primer momento, un cardenal asumiría temporalmente el cargo hasta que se convoque el cónclave que elegirá al nuevo Sumo Pontífice.\nComo se recuerda, el pontífice de 88 años fue hospitalizado el pasado viernes, 14 de febrero, debido a molestias con su sistema respiratorio, las mismas que se vieron expuestas durante la misa especial que ofició en la Plaza San Pedro, en el Vaticano, por el Jubileo de las Fuerzas Armadas.\nEs así que al modificarse su diagnóstico médico y ante un posible retiro de funciones, se ha comenzado a conocer los nombres de algunos cardenales candidatos a Papas y a continuación lo detallaremos.\nDe acuerdo al periodista Edward Pentin en su libro 'El próximo Papa', se difundió un listado con 19 posibles papas, de los cuales 10 ya fueron descartados debido a que superarían los 80 años, requisito importante para ocupar el trono de San Pedro.\nCardenales con posibilidad de convertirse en el próximo Papa\nGerhard Ludwig Müller (Alemania, 77 años): Fue prefecto de la Congregación para la Doctrina de la Fe.\nMalcolm Ranjith (Sri Lanka, 76 años): Arzobispo de Colombo, fue secretario de la Congregación para el Culto Divino y la Disciplina de los Sacramentos.\nPeter Turkson (Ghana, 76 años): Actual arzobispo de Bolonia y presidente de la Conferencia Episcopal Italiana.\nPietro Parolin (Italia, 70 años): Fue designado como presidente del Dicasterio para el Desarrollo Humano Integral hasta 2021. Es un candidato moderado, con sensibilidad social y abierto a temas como la justicia económica y el medio ambiente.\nWillem Eijk (Países Bajos, 71 años): Es Arzobispo de Utrecht y teólogo conservador. Se ha opuesto a los cambios en la doctrina relacionada a la moral sexual y la comunión a los divorciados.\nPeter Erdő (Hungría, 72 años): Es arzobispo de Esztergom-Budapest y primado de Hungría.\nLuis Antonio Tagle (Filipinas, 67 años): Es una de las figuras más destacadas del ala progresista de la Iglesia y ha sido considerado papable desde el cónclave de 2013. Es el más afín a la línea del Papa Francisco, por lo que es un probable continuador de su legado.\nDe esta manera, se conoció quiénes podría ser el posible sucesor del Papa Francisco ante un deterioro mayor en su salud tras padecer neumonía.",

    "title": "The Role of Corporate Wellness in Attracting Top Talent",
    "text": "In today's fiercely competitive job market, organizations are constantly on the lookout for ways to distinguish themselves and entice top-tier professionals to join their teams. At the heart of this effort lies the implementation of comprehensive corporate wellness programs, which have evolved significantly over the years. These programs have transcended mere health initiatives to encompass the holistic well-being of employees, encompassing physical, mental, and emotional aspects. As such, corporate wellness programs play a pivotal role in attracting top talent, making it a vital topic of exploration for industry professionals. In this extended article, we will delve deeper into the significance of corporate wellness in talent acquisition and outline the crucial factors to consider when evaluating wellness program options.\nThe Appeal of Corporate Wellness Programs\n- Enhanced Employee Well-Being\nCorporate wellness programs are a clear manifestation of a company's commitment to its employees' health and happiness. Top talent actively seeks employers who prioritize well-being because they understand the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Wellness initiatives that offer access to fitness facilities, stress management resources, nutrition counseling, and mental health support can significantly enhance the overall well-being of employees.\nEmployees who feel supported in their well-being journey are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and satisfied with their work. This positivity is contagious, creating a work environment that attracts top-tier professionals looking for an employer that prioritizes their health and happiness.\n- Increased Productivity and Engagement\nA healthy, engaged workforce is a productive one. Corporate wellness programs can significantly boost employee morale, reduce absenteeism, and improve overall job satisfaction. Prospective top talent recognizes the value of a thriving work culture and is more likely to gravitate toward organizations where employees are motivated and enthusiastic about their work.\nWhen evaluating potential employers, top talent considers the work environment as a crucial factor. Companies that invest in comprehensive wellness programs tend to exhibit higher levels of employee engagement, a factor that is particularly appealing to the most sought-after candidates.\n- Competitive Advantage\nIn the race to attract top talent, companies that invest in their employees' well-being gain a considerable advantage. Prospective employees are more inclined to choose an employer that demonstrates a commitment to employee health over one that lacks such initiatives. In essence, a robust wellness program can be a pivotal differentiator that helps your organization stand out in a crowded marketplace.\nAs an industry professional, it's imperative to understand that top talent has options, and they are discerning in their choices. Demonstrating a commitment to employee well-being through a corporate wellness program can be the decisive factor that sways them in your organization's favor.\n- Reduced Healthcare Costs\nCorporate wellness programs that emphasize preventive care can lead to reduced healthcare costs for both employees and the organization. This financial benefit can be an attractive perk for potential hires, as it underscores the company's commitment to long-term employee well-being.\nAs industry professionals, you are likely aware of the economic challenges that companies face. A well-structured wellness program can have a direct impact on the bottom line, making it an appealing proposition for top talent who wish to work for an organization that not only cares about their health but also allocates resources efficiently.\nWhat to Look for in Corporate Wellness Programs\nWhen evaluating corporate wellness programs, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure you're making the right choice to attract top talent. Here are some key aspects to keep in mind:\nComprehensive Approach\nLook for wellness programs that address physical, mental, and emotional health comprehensively. Holistic programs are more appealing to top talent as they cater to all aspects of well-being. These can include initiatives like on-site fitness facilities, mental health resources, nutrition programs, and stress management workshops.\nPersonalization\nEmployees have diverse needs and preferences when it comes to well-being. Seek programs that offer personalized wellness plans, allowing individuals to tailor their wellness journey according to their unique requirements. This customization ensures that top talent can access the resources and support they need to thrive.\nAccessibility\nIn today's flexible work environment, employees may be working on-site, remotely, or in hybrid setups. Ensure that wellness resources and activities are easily accessible to all employees, regardless of their work location. Digital platforms, mobile apps, and virtual wellness programs can be valuable tools for offering inclusive access.\nEngagement and Incentives\nWellness programs that promote employee engagement through challenges, incentives, and rewards tend to be more effective. Top talent is likely to be motivated by these initiatives, as they not only encourage participation but also foster a sense of community and friendly competition among employees.\nData Analytics\nChoose wellness programs that provide data-driven insights to track and measure the impact of the program on employee health and overall organizational performance. These analytics can help in fine-tuning the wellness program to ensure it aligns with the evolving needs of your workforce.\nSupportive Culture\nA company's culture should align with its wellness program. It's essential to foster a workplace culture that encourages well-being and work-life balance. A supportive culture is attractive to top talent, as they seek environments that prioritize their overall health and happiness.\nCorporate wellness programs have evolved into indispensable tools for attracting top talent in today's cutthroat job market. Organizations that prioritize employee well-being not only enhance their appeal to prospective hires but also reap the benefits of a more engaged and productive workforce.\nAs industry professionals, you understand that the success of your organization hinges on its ability to attract and retain top talent. Therefore, investing in corporate wellness is an investment in the future of your organization. It's a strategy that will help you consistently attract, retain, and empower the best talent in your industry.\nFor those seeking expert guidance in designing and implementing a winning wellness strategy, consider partnering with wellness consulting experts.

Kyiv, which is fighting Russian forces in Ukraine, has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane, but has challenged details of Moscow’s account and called for an international investigation.
