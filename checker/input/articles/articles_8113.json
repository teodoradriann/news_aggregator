The Kavkaz port is located in the Krasnodar region on the eastern side of Kerch Strait, reports Xinhua news agency.\nGovernor of Krasnodar region Veniamin Kondratyev confirmed that the ferry had sunk due to the damage sustained in the attack, though no fires were reported within the port itself.\nTo prevent the spread of fuel, containment booms were deployed, and the water’s surface was treated with absorbent material.\nEarlier on Thursday, a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at a military facility in Russia’s Volgograd region.\nRussian air defence forces repelled the assault, destroying most of the Ukrainian drones, Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov was quoted by the regional administration’s Telegram channel.\nThe attack occurred near the village of Marinovka, where the Ukrainian drones targeted a Russian military site, however, no casualties were reported.",

    "text": "CBC Temporary shelters in Sydney will bring 30 people in from the cold Read full article CBC January 12, 2024 at 12:08 a.m. · 2 min read Thirty Pallet shelters are expected to be delivered to a location on Henry Street in Sydney this month. The units and accompanying services will be managed by New Dawn Enterprises and the Ally Centre. (Jim Meyers/VertizonPhoto - image credit)\nNew temporary shelters coming to Sydney, N.S., will help 30 people experiencing homelessness, but there are still more people in need of housing, says the executive director of a local organization that will help manage the units.\n\"I mean this is just going to be a drop in the bucket, right? I know the homeless shelter itself is full to capacity at all times,\" said Christine Porter of the Ally Centre.\nThe Ally Centre and New Dawn Enterprise will co-manage the self-contained units which each contain a bed, heater, lighting, desk and shelving. Separate temporary buildings for toilets, showers, laundry and administration will be staffed 24 hours a day.\nTwo people who work through the Ally Centre will be on site and will help people who require treatment for addiction, harm reduction services or mental health care.\nPorter said although the 30 units coming to Sydney does not address the full need, it will get some people off the streets and into a more stable living environment.\n\"From our client list, there are 58 who are unhoused, right? So totally unhoused, not in the shelters or anything like that,\" she said. \"I know the homeless shelter itself is full to capacity at all times and when we have overnight stays here, there's always, you know, 10, 12, 13 people that stay here.\"\nOn Wednesday, the province announced the locations and number of Pallet shelters that will be coming to select areas. They are some of the 200 purchased by province last fall at a cost of $7.5 million.\nSydney will receive 30 units, 20 will go to Kentville, 19 to Lower Sackville and an undetermined number will be located at the Halifax Forum.\nChristine Porter, executive director of the Ally Centre. Christine Porter, the executive director of the Ally Centre, said her organization has a list of nearly 60 people who are living with homelessness this winter. (CBC)\nThe Cape Breton Regional Municipality will provide running water and electricity to the site which will also be fenced in for security reasons. The location selected near Whitney Pier is close to stores, public transit and other services.\nStory continues \"It was tricky to find a location that is like a certain distance from grocery store, a certain distance from a bus stop, a place where you know you're not having to incur an exorbitant cost in installing water and sewer, things like that,\" said Alyce MacLean, project manager through New Dawn.\nThe shelters will be delivered and installed within the next several weeks, according to MacLean. \"We'll get people housed as soon as humanly possible. I regret deeply that we couldn't have housed people before the winter set in, but you know, we're just doing our best,\" MacLean said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "厦门市园林植物园成为我省首个、全国第八个保育植物超万种的植物园。\n3月12日植树节前夕，素有“绿色博物馆”美誉的厦门市园林植物园（下简称“植物园”），迎来重要高光时刻，该园保育植物超1万种，是福建省首个、全国第八个保育植物超万种的植物园。\n全球植物园约3700个，但能够引种保存1万种以上活植物的植物园，仅有20多个；在我国200多个植物园中，此前也只有7个，包括华南国家植物园等。多年潜心耕耘，厦门市园林植物园终于成为福建首个“万种园”。\n我国首个“国家三角梅种质资源库”、国家棕榈植物迁地保育中心、中国首个以台湾和福建特色植物为主题的专类园区、中国生物多样性保护示范基地……一长串国家级荣誉等身，是对生物多样性保护和生态文明建设多年的坚守。日前我们走进这座园区，解锁福建首个“万种园”背后的生态密码。\n深耕植物引种驯化和品种选育\n植物物种收集和保护，是衡量科学植物园的一个最重要指标。\n深耕探索，久久为功。据厦门市市政园林局副局长陈阳都介绍，建园以来，植物园坚持开展植物引种驯化和品种选育工作，推动绿色发展与生态保护良性互动，生物多样性保护成效显著。\n截至2025年2月，园区已从国内外引种和选育保护植物306科2023属10058种（含品种和种下分类单元），主要包括棕榈科、秋海棠科、凤梨科、苏铁科、三角梅、多肉植物、姜目植物及闽台特色植物等热带亚热带植物。\n其中，世界自然保护联盟（IUCN）濒危物种红色名录约900种；国家一级保护植物11种，二级保护植物73种；国家重点保护野生植物45科57属115种，福建省级重点保护植物29种，中国（含福建）特有种36个；自主培育植物新品种35个，其中三角梅、福建山樱花16个品种获得国家植物新品种授权，三角梅、秋海棠、姜花等19个品种获国际登录。\n三角梅是厦门市花，植物园更是我国首个国家三角梅种质资源库，截至目前，保存了1000余份三角梅种质资源，500多个三角梅品种，其中16个品种为自主培育，成为国内保存三角梅品种资源最丰富的机构之一。\n植物园花木生产科科长周群说，“2007年我园开始开展三角梅的杂交育种研究，已筛选出200余份优质的三角梅可育资源，自主选育出授权三角梅新品种10多个，我国首个三角梅新品种‘中闽1号’正是其中的佼佼者”。\n该品种历经8年自主选育而成，具有抗虫，抗病，花期长，花量大的优点，同时因其植株较为直立，植株节间极短，叶呈罕见的圆形或近圆形，叶厚，带革质，是做三角梅盆花与盆景的极佳材料。\n多年育种实践，成就硕果累累——2020年，新品种“中闽2号”等10个新品种通过国家林草局评审；同年，清香型三角梅通过国际新品种登录，填补“叶子花属无香味”的行业空白。\n“未来我们还将规划收集全球三角梅种质资源11个种1500余个品种，采用DNA、植物活植株等多方位资源保存方式，实现全球三角梅种质资源全覆盖。”周群表示。\n深度探索珍稀濒危植物保护利用\n笔筒树被誉为植物界的“活化石”，早在3亿6000年前就存在，被列为国家二级保护植物和世界濒危物种，原来只发现分布在中国台湾、琉球群岛和菲律宾，于1981年首次在厦门发现，是研究台湾海峡两岸植物起源与演化、亲缘与传播关系的标志性植物。\n去年10月，植物园科研项目《福建省厦门市笔筒树珍稀濒危野生植物人工扩繁与野外回归》获得中央财政林业发展项目支持，将首次启动这一珍稀濒危植物的野外回归工程。\n对这一珍稀植物的保护，厦门走在前头。此前，通过对笔筒树的孢子繁殖、无菌培养以及拳卷叶组织培养技术的研究，取得系列研究成果，获得笔筒树1万多株，并立项制定两岸通用标准《笔筒树栽培技术规程》。\n“作为中国生物多样性保护示范基地，我们致力于植物物种多样性和基因多样性两方面的工作，制定长期的植物收集规划，在引种栽培保育超万种植物中，濒危物种超1000种。”厦门市园林植物园主任丁印龙说。\n积极践行珍稀濒危植物保护责任，植物园发挥迁地保护场所的作用，与国家植物园体系建设相呼应，建成16个植物专类园区，形成了较为系统的植物保护和展示体系——\n在多肉植物区，厦门引种栽培45科3208种，数量位居国内外植物园前列，科研成果获厦门市科技进步奖1项。\n在棕榈科植物区，引种收集约97属446种，数量名列中国植物园前茅，2011年获批设立“国家棕榈植物保育中心”。\n在雨林植物区，构建热带雨林景观与热带雨林植物多样性保护网络，将热带雨林北移并建成梦幻如仙境的城市园林景观，成为超级网红景点。\n此外，在福建山樱花、朱砂根、姜花属植物、沙漠玫瑰、秋海棠属植物、凤梨科植物和竹类植物引种保育方面，植物园也走在全国前列。\n保护古树名木10株，为每一株古树名木建立详细档案；发表植物新分类群7个，填补植物相关类群分类学空白……\n对种群的分类命名，是植物园对于业界的又一重大贡献。据植物园二级研究员陈松河介绍，厦门在国内外首次发现命名和发表的植物新分类群就有7个，分别是匍匐廉序竹、长耳吊丝竹、中岩茶秆竹、万石山思劳竹、耶耳竹、花叶唐竹（新变种）、黄果野鸦椿（新变种），其中前三者分别被《全球生物物种名录》和《中国生物物种名录》收载。\n深入开展两岸植物引种交流融合\n“去年11月首届三角梅产业高质量发展大会举办期间，台湾同行为我园带来了自主培育的三角梅新品——‘四倍体马尼拉小姐、四倍体玫瑰红’等，为我园的三角梅种质资源库再添新品种。”厦门市园林植物园副主任蔡邦平表示。\n两岸开展植物引种交流，源自2003年，当年在厦门首次举办的“厦金植物园建设与城市绿化学术研讨会”上，厦门向金门县植物园赠送新优苗木200多种，拉开了两岸植物物种交流的序幕。\n此后，两岸交流不断。2014—2015年，厦台开启秋海棠的交流合作与互访，台湾业界友人送来近200种秋海棠，从此开启植物园在秋海棠的收集保护与研究工作，目前已成为国内收集秋海棠种类最多的植物园。\n蔡邦平说：“2022年7月，我们在园区南门建设闽台植物专类园，这是中国首个以台湾和福建特色植物为主题的专类园区，种植台湾赤楠、兰屿肉桂、福建山樱花、福建紫薇、闽楠等约500种（含品种）台湾和福建特色植物，种苗大多来自长期合作的台企，为两岸植物交流提供了重要展示平台。”\n通过建设闽台植物园区、与台企和科研机构合作等方式，植物园在植物引种交流方面先行先试，为两岸融合发展提供了生动实践，推动两岸在植物领域的深度融合和共同发展。\n“十五五期间，我们将再引种新增植物2000种以上，进一步丰富植物种质资源，加强新优品种选育、研究和推广，积极拓展海峡两岸植物学术交流合作，为厦门高颜值城市建设和生态文明建设作出更大的贡献。”丁印龙主任表示。\n（陈挺 黄宇燕 林婕）",

    "text": "[NPC1](/user/NPC1)a [lavanguardia.com](/go/link/3974042)\n¿Como de subnormal hay que ser para pagar por mostrar a una ciudad de un millón de habitantes lo subnormal que eres?\n[#4](c4#c-4) a mí esto me suena a felicidad impostada. A Mr Wonderfull, a querer tapar una fuga de agua con buenas intenciones, a Teletubbies modernos. Pero que sabré yo que soy un triste\n[#4](c4#c-4) Eso digo yo, otra cosa sería que lo hicieran con música en altavoces. Si a la gente no le importa hacer el ridículo, y se lo pasan bien así, por mi perfecto.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Depende de cuantos sean y por dónde pasen, supongo. Si se meten en medio de la plaza de la reina o delante del palau de la música y son 25 personas caben tranquilamente, pero si se meten esos mismos 25 en una acera de 3 metros como se ve en la captura... pues joden 15m de acera \"a su ritmo\" por la puta cara.\nHace años ya se liaron pollos con los segway, porque ni contaminan ni hacen ruido, pero cuando van unos cuantos juntos colapsan calles y cruces.\n[#14](c14#c-14) porque seguramente moleste al resto, tu ves un grupo de flipados bailando, te mererias en su camino? pasarias entre ellos? le dejarías paso a todos priorizandolos?\nTampoco hay que pensar mucho para darse cuenta que es una molestia\n[#4](c4#c-4) Pues sí. Esa parece la moda, criticar a una de las actividades que más ingresos generan en este país. Otra cosa que sí es criticable es la actitud de la gente, la mala educación, etc. Pero eso desgraciadamente lo padecemos a diario en todos los ámbitos, en el trabajo, en la calle, en el supermercado, etc. No es exclusivo del turismo. Pero vamos, que si tan malo es puede que tengamos que reorientar la producción hacia el sector primario.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Mucho amargado que no tiene un duro para irse de vacaciones y en vez de cagarse en la madre que pario a su empresa que le paga una mierda, se desahoga odiando turistas\n[#4](c4#c-4) Estoy de acuerdo pero... No es lo mismo una persona con auriculares bailando por la calle que un grupo de diez o veinte, con \"coreografías\" y ocupando todo el espacio. Sin ver ningún vídeo es difícil opinar, pero por lo leído tiene que ser un poquito incordiante.\n[#4](c4#c-4) No es quejarse por quejarse, mucha gente si, pero otros no tanto.\nVivo en mallorca y mi ingresos vienen gracias al turismo.\nAún así, hay que reconocer que no todo vale. Ya que hay actividades que pueden ser muy guays para los turistas pero realmente molestas para la gente que vive en la zona.\nPor ejemplo, aquí se han limitado los tours de buggies y motos de agua. Debido a que hacen un tour cada hora durante 8 horas por los mismos caminos y calas. Para la gente que vive en las zonas de paso es insoportable.\nY volviendo a la noticia, realmente es muy molesto los grupos de turistas. Como cruceristas, estos bailando, etc, debido a que no es lo mismo 50 turistas paseando a su bola que 50 turistas haciendo lo mismo, los segundos bloquean por completo.\nY el problema no es que haya 1 grupo, es que hay 3-4 grupos cada hora.\nLas críticas que yo defiendo son contra la masificación, no se puede todo para todos.\nEnésimo artículo de mierda sobre el tema cansino del verano para que la gente haga el clic correspondiente y el periódico gane dinerito, que está la cosa mu achuchá.\nHay que ser imbécil o tener un problema mental para que te moleste que haya gente bailando sin hacer ruido.\nA ver, si no molestan con auriculares no me parece mal. Que los frivolos guiris se diviertan como quieran.",
