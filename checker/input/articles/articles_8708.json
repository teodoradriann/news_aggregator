    "title": "'I... Believe in the Power of Prayer': Actress Roma Downey on God, Tragedy, and Trust",
    "text": "'I... Believe in the Power of Prayer': Actress Roma Downey on God, Tragedy, and Trust\nActress and producer Roma Downey has built a long career in Hollywood, creating TV and film content that inspires and entertains.\nListen to them on the latest episode of “Quick Start”\nThe “Touched By An Angel” star has also carried her uplifting, family-friendly messages into literary works, including a new children’s book, “\nA Message in the Moon.”\nDowney said her touching new book is deeply personal, with the concept predicated upon her childhood.\n“This story for this book has sat in my heart for a really long time,” she recently told CBN Digital. “My mother died when I was just a little girl; I was only 10.”\nAs a result of such a monumental loss due to an unexpected heart attack, Downey said she became quite close to her father, whom she described as a “great dad.” The struggles that came along with her mother’s death, though, were profound.\n“To say that we were heartbroken would be an understatement, because we didn’t even have the preparation of illness, which I know can be traumatic and painful for a child to see their parents suffer and go through a long illness,” she said. “But … there was no warning, and so it was as if somebody just turned the lights out in our lives.”\nDowney continued, “If I was making a movie of my own life, my childhood would be in full technicolor, and then, when my mother died, it’s as if the movie then went into black and white.”\nWatch Downey tell her story:\nThe actress said she doesn’t know how she and her family would have coped without their faith.\n“If we hadn’t had faith to lean into, if we hadn’t been people of faith, I don’t know how we would have coped,” she said. “I really don’t know. … As Christians and as believers, we have an understanding of the promises of Christ around this issue, and the promise of heaven, and the resurrection of the body, and all the things that we’ve been taught and believe.”\nDowney said she believes the experience of losing her mother so young helped give her empathy and compassion. These emotions and attributes have since colored much of her personal and professional work and story.\nYears after her mother’s death, Downey, who grew up in Ireland, recalled preparing to leave her father’s home to study at a college in England; she remembered being anxious about leaving her father.\n“It [was] back in the day before there was a cell phone,” she said. “So, dad took me outside into the garden, and he pointed to the moon, and he said, ‘Wherever you are in the world, Roma, you don’t need to feel anxious or alone, because it’s the same moon that will be shining down on us, and, wherever you are, wherever you go, I’m going to leave a message in the moon for you.”\nDowney said knowing she and her dad would be looking at the same moon provided her with “great comfort” in the following months and years.\n“When I’d be walking home from college back to my lodging house, and I’d glance up, and I’d see the moon … I would pick up the message from my dad, and I would know that my dad loved me, and cared for me.”\nDowney said her dad died while she was in college, but his timeless message about the moon remained with her over the decades. And she said the lessons and story were “sitting, and growing, and tugging” at her heart for years.\n“I kept thinking, ‘There must be a nugget in this story that would make a beautiful and powerful story for young children, particularly children, perhaps, who are anxious about any kind of separation,'” Downey said. “If mom’s going off to work, or grandma’s moving across the country, your best friend doesn’t live here anymore.”\nSo, Downey wrote “\nA Message in the Moon” to help kids and families navigate those tough scenarios. She’s also hoping the book helps guide kids and families to rely more on prayer.\n“I do believe in the power of prayer and … I begin and end my day with prayer,” Downey said. “I ended my book with a prayer to encourage parents … to relax and create that peace in our little ones before they fall asleep.”\nNeed prayer?

    "text": "PARIS — Bev Priestman's time at the Paris Olympics ended before the opening ceremony.\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee has removed the head coach of its women's national soccer head coach for the remainder of the Games amid a drone spying scandal.\nThe COC added in a statement released at 1:24 a.m. local time that assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the defending gold medallists for the remainder of the tournament.\nCanada's camp was thrown into disarray this week after two team staffers were sent home for allegedly using a drone to spy on a New Zealand practice. Priestman denied any involvement, but did not attend Thursday's 2-1 victory over New Zealand as FIFA — soccer's world governing body — and the International Olympic Committee investigate.\nCanada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said in the COC release \"additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\"\nHe added Priestman is suspended from her duties until the end of the tournament and the completion of the organization's independent external review.\nThis report by The Canadia Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "KRJ leva nova tecnologia em conectores para o mercado peruano\nEmpresa brasileira de conexões para rede aérea de distribuição apresenta soluções de baixa tensão para modernização do setor elétrico no Peru\nA KRJ, empresa do segmento de conexões para rede aérea de distribuição, participa de 16 a 18 de outubro, de um dos maiores eventos do Peru de relacionamento e negócios para empresas do setor elétrico, a Expo Internacional do Setor Elétrico PECIER-FISE. Esta edição será realizada no Centro de Exposiciones Jockey, em Lima, e terá um pavilhão inteiramente do setor elétrico brasileiro. A empresa irá apresentar seu portfólio de conectores perfurantes para baixa e média tensão, sendo o destaque a linha KPB de conectores perfurantes universais que foram desenvolvidos para atender as conexões em qualquer tipo de configuração, ou seja, com aplicação em ambos os lados do produto.\nPara o gerente geral da KRJ, Marcelo Mendes, a participação em um evento tão significativo para o setor na América do Sul, reforça a expansão da empresa com produtos de qualidade. \"O Peru passa por um grande momento de modernização. Estamos levando para a expo nossos conectores universais da linha KPB que acompanham essa evolução. Por meio dos produtos da KRJ e das certificações que possuímos para operar naquele país, queremos comprovar a força da indústria brasileira, competindo de igual para igual em outros países importantes. Nesse mercado também temos parceiros de longa data, como as grandes empresas de distribuição de energia elétrica Enel Perú e a Luz Del Sur. Participar desse evento consagra, portanto, nosso excelente momento no mercado peruano\" reforçou Mendes.\nOs conectores da família KPB, que serão apresentados na PECIER-FISE, foram desenvolvidos para conexões de baixa tensão e atender as conexões do ramal de entrada do cliente entre condutores rígidos ou flexíveis (nus ou isolados) em qualquer tipo de configuração. \"Desta forma, para realizar a aplicação, o funcionário operacional não necessita mais identificar a lateral do conector, porque ambos os lados do produto aplicam estes condutores, definindo o conceito universal do produto\", destacou Mendes.\nEste conector perfurante universal para ligação com consumidores privados ou empresariais, é composto por componentes poliméricos com resistência aos raios ultravioleta e barramentos em liga de cobre estanhado. Entre as principais características da família KPB, destaca-se o balanço no barramento que realiza o efeito mola na conexão e a maior abrangência do alcance (range) de aplicação, o que reduz a quantidade de itens a serem selecionados pelo funcionário operacional. Isso reduz significativamente o índice de falhas na rede por erro de seleção. A família KPB tem alcance (range) de cabos na faixa de 6mm² a 240mm².",

    "text": "Descenso confirmado: Colón jugará la próxima temporada en la Primera B Nacional El Tribunal de Disciplina de la AFA firmó este jueves la resolución que echa por la borda el recurso presentado por el club santafesino para anular su descenso. Tras la reunión que mantuvieron este martes el titular de AFA, Claudio Tapia, y el presidente saliente de Colón, José Vignatti, para determinar si se hace curso al reclamo de la entidad santafesina solicitando la nulidad de su descenso a la Primera Nacional, el Tribunal de Disciplina de la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino firmó este jueves la resolución que indica la desestimación de ese pedido. De esta manera y luego de perder el desempate por el descenso frente a Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, el club de Santa Fe deberá jugar la próxima temporada en la Primera B Nacional. Los fundamentos que había presentado Colón para no irse a la B - La anulación del segundo descenso por promedios no corresponde, ya que la modificación debió hacerse por el Comité Ejecutivo y no por Asamblea. - En la Asamblea no estaban todos los representantes presentes, porque faltaba Talleres, de Córdoba. - Cuando se quitó el descenso, el reglamento no especificó qué sucedía si el mismo equipo que era último por promedios también lo era por tabla general, como fue el caso de Arsenal, que liberó un cupo para que descienda Colón. Ante la posibilidad de que Colón efectivamente permanezca en primera el propio Vignatti le recomendó a su sucesor en el cargo que no se apurara con la elección del próximo entrenador, luego del alejamiento de Israel Damonte, ya que \"no es lo mismo un técnico para primera que para el ascenso\", pero la tajante respuesta de Godano fue que \"pase lo que pase, el elegido es Iván Delfino\".

    "text": "SYLMAR (KABC) -- Anyone who's ever loved a dog knows what a blessing they can be -- loyal companions that better your life in countless ways. A new documentary now streaming on Hulu explores how dogs can provide an invaluable tool for children with autism.\n\"Unleashing Hope: The Power of Service Dogs for Children with Autism\" chronicles actor and comedian Rosie O'Donnell's very personal story about how a service dog transformed the life of her child Clay, who has autism.\nIt also highlights a local group that's changing lives -- \"Guide Dogs of America Tender Loving Canines\" - and is based right here in Southern California.\nCheryl Herman is director of service dog programs.\n\"We provide service dogs to veterans with, PTSD, TBI, and mobility issues, children with autism and facility dogs where they go into hospitals, courthouses, and for guide dogs for the blind and visually impaired. We do not charge anything for our dogs. It's free of charge,\" said Herman. \"We will fly you here, train you everything you need to know, and then give it up to follow up support without charging you a dime.\"\n\"Finding that right match really is going to balance that individual's life versus impacted in a negative way. If I have a high energy child, I put a low energy dog in there. The hope is it might help that child kind of calm down, find their center and kind of ground them and relax them versus bringing out more energy. Same thing with veterans,\" said Hanna Belyea, Manager of Admissions.\n\"We provide that guide dog, we provide a veteran who hasn't been out since the wars or hasn't been out from whatever incident they have, that they can go out now, they can go out and enjoy that family with the autistic child. They can go out. So we provide hope,\" said Tony Blevins, President/Director, Guide Dogs of America.\n\"In 2009, I lost my sight,\" said Teresa Blevins, Outreach Development, Guide Dogs of America. \"During those times I was walking with the cane before I got my guide dog. It was very difficult. I can tell her to find the seat for me if I don't see or hear the car coming, but she does. She won't take me until it's clear.\"\n\"I think what makes this place so special, that Guide Dogs of America and loving canines is just the community aspect of it.,\" said Katherine Juhl, Senior Manager. \"You have your network of volunteers that raise puppies, helping in the nursery and everyone their their primary goal is to move towards our mission and help us put highly trained service dogs in the hands of those who need them.\"",

    "text": "Latest Weather Blog LSU AgCenter gives advice on how to prepare your plants for the upcoming cold snap BATON ROUGE - AgCenter professionals with LSU have advised homeowners and plant owners ahead of next week's frigid weather. Temperatures are expected to drop below 30 degrees with wind chills even lower, and there are ways to prepare your home and your plants ahead of the snap. Read the statement from the AgCenter below: Winter is about to make its presence known, and with it comes many questions about protecting landscape plants, pipes and pets when the temperature drops. LSU AgCenter professionals say everyone should pay attention to the forecasts to know ahead of time when freezing weather is approaching. Carol Friedland, director of the LSU AgCenter LaHouse Research and Education Center, gives these tips to homeowners: — Running just one faucet with a small trickle of water when temperatures are below freezing can prevent water freezing in your pipes. Trending News — Use fiberglass or foam sleeves to wrap your outdoor faucets and secure that with tape or foil to prevent freezing. If you can’t find materials to wrap your faucets, household objects like old newspapers or rags can be used. — Avoid using a gas stove or oven to heat your home, this can be dangerous. — Stay near the interior parts of a home if you lose power. If you use a generator temporarily, never use one indoors, in your garage or under a carport. AgCenter horticulturist Heather Kirk-Ballard provides information for taking care of the plants during a cold snap. She said when protecting plants, start by prepping your tropical and cold-sensitive potted plants. “If temperatures begin to drop into the 30s, you need to get them indoors, in your garage, carport or protected in the corner of a patio,” she said. For landscape plants, thoroughly water them before a freeze if the soil is dry. This is especially important for container-grown plants. Shrubs in landscape beds also can be helped with irrigation prior to a freeze. Keep in mind that your cool-season bedding plants are adapted to the cold temperatures that are normal in Louisiana during winter, so cold protection typically is not needed for them. For plants growing in the ground, mulch them with a loose, dry material such as pine straw or leaves. Mulches will only protect what they cover and are best used to protect below-ground parts and crowns. Larger plants can be protected by creating a simple structure and covering it with sheets, quilts or plastic. The structure holds the covering off the foliage, preventing broken branches and improving cold protection. It need be nothing more elaborate than driving into the ground three stakes slightly taller than the plant. The cover should extend to the ground and be sealed with soil, stones or bricks. Plastic covers should be vented or removed on sunny, warm days. For severe freezes, like those expected next week, when temperatures dip into the teens, providing a heat source under the covering helps. A safe, easy way to do this is to generously wrap or drape the plant with small outdoor Christmas lights. The lights provide heat but do not get hot enough to burn the plant or cover. Be careful to use only outdoor extension cords and sockets. If necessary, you may prune back a large plant to make its size more practical to cover.

    "text": "Many Berkshire towns have large holdings of land that are open to the public. Lucky public. In the case of Pownal, Vt., most of a tract of land was open but had been inaccessible since 2011, when Tropical Storm Irene enlarged the Hoosic River and took out a riverside section of the trail. Now, with the help of numerous partners, including the Vermont Land Trust, the town has added 300 acres plus a right-of-way — soon to be ownership — on a four-acre parcel that provides public access. Members of the town’s Conservation Commission, Parks and Recreation Committee, the Hoosic River Watershed Association and the public in late June assembled in Halifax Hollow to walk the new route. Attending was Sarah Gardner of Williams College’s Center for Environmental Studies. In the fall, her planning class students will work with town boards to make recommendations about the use of the town forest. (For free.) The original 700 acres belonged to the Pownal Tannery, which treated hides in an old mill building beside the Hoosic. Earlier, the land probably belonged to the textile mill, which would have wanted to protect the clean water coming off the Taconic Range for its operations. Lewis Hine’s 1910 photograph of little Addie working there created support for a national child labor movement. Previously, the river was dammed for a grist mill. The Tannery discharged untreated wastewater into the river until 1962, when a lagoon system was installed and later the Dean Road Landfill took the contents of the lagoons. The company declared bankruptcy in 1988. The 28-acre mill site was declared a U.S. Superfund site in 1999. The Environmental Protection Agency and state environmentalist came up with an imaginative way to turn pollution into river improvement. That included tearing down the mill while leaving the dam and water intake to continue hydroelectric generation, capping the lagoons and landfill, and installing the community’s first wastewater treatment plant. Pownal homes are on a sewer line for the first time. The popular Taconic Crest Trail once ran 36 miles from Hancock Shaker Village to the Tannery land. Reportedly, unregulated four-wheelers and aggressive dogs forced a change, the terminus becoming Prosser Hollow in New York state. More recently, New York acquired land to continue the trail north to Route 346, beside the Hoosic in North Petersburg, N.Y. Pownal would like to see the town, and Vermont, once more connected with a trail that meanders between New York and Massachusetts. The Taconic Hiking Club, based in Troy, N.Y., and New York state do not want motorized vehicles on the trail, but riders have a traditional claim on some of the many trails on the Tannery property. Hiking and riding — and perhaps newer uses, such as mountain biking — would be options. In the Tannery days, most of the land was cleared, perhaps in part to get the tannin necessary to work the hides. Will logging continue? Hunters have traditionally roamed the land. The new right-of-way leads above the private holdings and onto tannery land on the steep side of the Taconics. We cut through shrubbery off Dean Road. Soon we’re on a bulldozed logging road, passing the active gravel operation on our right. We cross a log landing, with steep skidder roads dropping down to the brook on our left. A mile or so up we stop where, angling off the trail to the right, we get a view of a waterfall through the forest. Most public land is controlled by the state or nonprofits in these parts. With the 1,000-acre Tannery land, representatives of the town, aided by college students, will work through the issues. It should be exciting. At least, that’s how it looks from the White Oaks.",
