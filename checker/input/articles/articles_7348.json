    "text": "1 min read 24 May 2024, 02:39 PM IST Written By Alka Jain Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that God has sent him. Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor criticized him over not ‘born biologically’ remark. Premium\nCongress leader Shashi Tharoor. (PTI) Read Full Story Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his not ‘born biologically' remark . In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Thiruvananthapuram MP shared a snippet in which PM Modi said, “I am convinced I was not born biologically, God sent me\".\nTharoor asked an “innocent question\" from the Election Commission of India. “Can a divine being be eligible for citizenship in India, and if not, does he have the right to vote or to contest elections? \" he posted on the microblogging site.\n“Could @ECISVEEP look into the question of a self-proclaimed divinity participating in the electoral fray?\" the Congress leader asked.\nPM Modi, in an interview with News18 in the Varanasi constituency , commented in Hindi, “When my mother was alive, I believed I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\"\n“ Pehle jab tak maa zinda thi mujhe lagta tha ki shayad biologically mujhe janam diya gaya hai. Maa ke jaane ke baad in saare anubhavo ko mai jod kar dekhta hoon to mai convince ho chuka hu, galat ho sakta hoon, aalochak, left log toh meri dhajjiya uda denge, mere baal noch lenge…mai convince ho chuka hoon ki parmatma ne mujhe bheja hai .\"\n“ Ye urja biological shareer se nahi mili hai, ye urja ishwar mujhse kuch kaam lena hai, isliye mujhe vidha bhi di hai, samarthya bhi diya hai…aur mai kuch nahi hoon, ek instrument hoon jo ishwar mere roop me kiya hai (This energy could not be from my biological body, but was bestowed upon me by God. I believe God has given me abilities, inspiration, and good intentions for a purpose… I am nothing but an instrument.)\"\nThis remark quickly gathered the opposition's attention with several political leaders attacking the Prime Minister over his statement amid the ongoing Lok Sabha elections .\nRahul Gandhi said that if an ordinary person had uttered this statement, that person would have been taken to a 'psychiatrist'. On X, the Wayanad MP said, “ Desh k Pradhan Mantri chamcho k samne, interview mein khul k kehete hain, main biological nahin hoon….mujhe parmatma ne mission k liye bheja hain.\"\nThe Congress leader sarcastically referred to the remarks made by PM Modi, depicting himself as a quasi-messiah.\nMilestone Alert!

    "title": "In a harsh phone call, Biden demanded that Netanyahu release Palestinian tax revenues - voila! news - The Limited Times",
    "text": "Biden: I wish I could be there to hug Abigail/Reuters\nUS President Joe Biden had a difficult conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Saturday about Palestinian tax revenues that Israel has been freezing for two months. Biden demanded that Netanyahu solve the problem and then ended the conversation, according to two senior American and Israeli officials and a third source familiar with the issue.\nMore on the subject: Israel to US: Demand Hezbollah 10 kilometers from border Poll: Nearly half of Israelis think Netanyahu is misbehaving vis-à-vis Biden Biden: \"Bibi told me, 'You dropped an atomic bomb, many civilians were killed.'\" \"Investing in this land now can make you a millionaire.\" Why it's important: A senior US official said it was one of the most difficult and frustrating phone calls between Biden and Netanyahu since the start of the war in Gaza. The difficult conversation is another sign of the growing tension between the president and the prime minister in recent weeks. More in Walla! Biden hugs and the shekel soars: Why is the currency strengthening during our most difficult times? See full article >\nQuick reminder: Two months ago, Israel's political-security cabinet decided to deduct about 40 percent of the tax revenues Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, which it is obligated to transfer to it by virtue of agreements between the sides. The decision was made following a demand by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who claimed that the funds were transferred by the PA to the Gaza Strip and would therefore reach Hamas. Since that decision, Smotrich has refused any compromise on the issue and even threatened that if the funds were transferred directly or indirectly to the Palestinian Authority, he would resign from his position. One of the most difficult and frustrating phone calls. Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu/Government Press Office, Haim Tzach\nBackstage: The 45-minute conversation focused on the next phase of Israel's ground operation in Gaza and plans to expand it to al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, Israeli and U.S. officials said. Toward the end of the conversation, however, Biden raised his concerns about Israel's freezing of PA tax revenues. The president asked the prime minister to accept a proposal that Israel itself made to the United States a few weeks ago, according to which the offset tax lines would be transferred to custody in Norway until an agreement was reached that would address Israel's concern that the money might reach Hamas. The Palestinian Authority has already agreed to this proposal and made it clear to the US that under such an arrangement it would be willing to renew the receipt of the portion of tax money that Israel did not freeze. A senior U.S. official and a source familiar with the contents of the conversation said that Netanyahu surprised Biden by retracting Israel's agreement and said he no longer believed the Norwegian proposal was good. Netanyahu told Biden that he does not trust Norway and stressed that the Palestinian Authority should simply take part of the tax money that Israel is willing to transfer to it. Biden replied to Netanyahu that the U.S. trusts Norway and that should be enough for Israel to trust that offer as well, a senior U.S. official said. U.S. and Israeli officials said Biden told Netanyahu he had to deal with extremists in his coalition who oppose the transfer of tax dollars just as he faces political pressure on the Gaza war from some congressional Democrats. A few minutes later, Biden told Netanyahu that he expected him to find a solution to the issue, noting that \"this conversation is over.\" \"The feeling was that the president was going above and beyond for Netanyahu and taking political risks every day, but when Bibi's moment comes to give something back and take a political risk, he won't do it,\" a senior U.S. official said. Another senior U.S. official who commented on the details of the article tried to downplay the controversy, noting that Netanyahu did not reject the Norwegian proposal out of hand, but \"said that he was still trying to resolve some issues on the Israeli side.\" Snapshot: A few days after the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, a close associate of the prime minister, Minister Ron Dermer, arrived at the White House for talks with President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The issue of Palestinian tax money was one of the topics discussed. A senior US official noted that since the phone call between Biden and Netanyahu, progress has been made on the issue. \"I think this matter is on the way to being resolved,\" the U.S. official said. What they say: A White House spokesman said the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu was \"good and helpful.\" More on the subject: Benjamin Netanyahu Joe Biden Iron Sword War Gaza War Taxes Palestinians",

    "text": "Maria Bernadette Romero Published on: 10 Jan 2025, 10:00\nCopied\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries but is also being used by cybercriminals to enhance phishing scams.\nCybersecurity firm Kaspersky warns that AI is enabling highly personalized and convincing attacks that even experienced professionals find difficult to detect.\nA Kaspersky study released to the press on Friday revealed that nearly half or 49 of surveyed organizations reported an increase in cyberattacks over the past year, with phishing as the most common threat. Half of respondents expect phishing attempts to rise further as AI becomes more widely used by cybercriminals.\nAI now allows attackers to create targeted phishing emails by analyzing publicly available data, such as social media profiles and company websites. The emails mimic the tone and style of legitimate communications, making them hard to distinguish from genuine messages.\nSimilarly, the technology is also being used to create deep fakes — fake audio or video messages that convincingly impersonate executives. In one case, attackers used a deepfake during a video call to trick an employee into transferring $25.6 million.\nEven experienced employees are falling victim due to the realism of these scams, which often exploit urgency or authority to pressure recipients into acting quickly.\nKaspersky urges businesses to adopt multi-layered defenses, including regular training on AI-enabled threats and advanced security tools that detect anomalies in email communications.\nA zero-trust approach, which limits access to sensitive systems, can also reduce the risk of significant breaches.\n“Regular, up-to-date AI-focused cybersecurity awareness training is critical for employees, helping them identify the subtle signs of phishing and other malicious tactics. Alongside this, businesses should implement robust security tools capable of detecting anomalies in emails, such as unusual writing patterns or suspicious metadata,” Kaspersky said.\n“By restricting access to sensitive data and systems, this approach ensures that even if attackers breach one layer of security, they cannot compromise the entire network,” it added.\nphishing scams artificial intelligence (AI) cybersecurity firm Kaspersky",
