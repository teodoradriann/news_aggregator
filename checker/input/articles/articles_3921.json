    "text": "Powerful ocean waves continued to pound California’s coastline on Friday morning — perhaps with slightly less force than 24 hours earlier — and the National Weather Sercice said the second in a series of storms continued to move methodically toward the region. Rain is expected to begin falling by noon and then get heavy as the afternoon and evening progress, NWS meteorologist Roger Gass said. At least an inch is expected through most of the region, although “slightly less” might fall in the South Bay and “a bit more” could soak the coastal mountains, he said. “In general, it’s going to be heavy everywhere,” Gass said. The weather service also continued to advise people to avoid the beach or other pursuits that may occur just off the water. A coastal flood advisory remained in effect through 2 p.m. On Thursday, large, dangerous waves [thrashed coastal towns.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/28/beach-is-a-dangerous-place-as-high-surf-pounds-bay-area-coast-ahead-of-next-storm/) They were not expected to be quite as powerful on Friday, but Gass said they were still plenty powerful enough. “We’re expecting high waves to be crashing on-shore again. Maybe not quite as big,” he said. “We’re really gonna see an increase again (Saturday), as a new swell comes on shore” On Saturday, swells were expected to be at least 23 feet high, and they could peak at 40 feet in areas such as Maverick’s, where surfers travel for big waves. The storm arriving early Friday is expected to drop rain on the region through the overnight hours and into early Saturday morning, when it is expected to depart the region. The Bay Area won’t have a lot of time to dry out; another quick-moving storm system that won’t produce as much rainfall is expected to arrive Sunday night and last into Monday. Another system also tails that one, Gass said, and is likely to arrive Tuesday night. “We’re definitely in a more active pattern,” he said, adding that it’s typical for this time of year. “The pattern may not be as strong as previous ones we’ve seen, but it’s there.” Temperatures were expected to rise slightly with Friday’s rain, with highs moving into the mid-60s through the region and the lows curtailing in the low 50s. The arrival of Sunday’s system is likely to bring temperatures back down again, according to forecasters.",

Quien ataco primero fueron los ejercitos reformados de Jordania, Siria, Egipto, ... .\nLuego los israelies hicieron lo que hicieron, pero quien no se sento a negociar fueron, no los palestinos, si no los ejercitos de los paises arabes de alrededor por asunto religioso: una tierra del islam (en minusculas) no puede ser perdida.\n[#83](c83#c-83) lo mismo con el gobierno genocida sionista: sacarlos de israel, pero su gente y eeuu no lo permiten (no te jode). Te respondo a ti porque al prosionista/progenocida lo tengo bloqueado\n[#76](c76#c-76) No digo que los conflictos sean distintos (cuáles son iguales?) es que los túneles vietnamitas eran pequeños, de hormiguero. No con motocicletas y lanzamisiles.\nIgual tú pecas de igualar dos países sin fundamento, más que no te gustan\n[#86](c86#c-86) y qué esperas que haga el pueblo palestino ante su genocidio\nAgradecer al país que te acoge cuando lo necesitas.\n[#116](c116#c-116) La familia de Arafat. Vaya.\n¿Y a Arafat qué le pasó?\n¿Y a Isaac Rabin?\nIgual vas a tener razón con eso de que algunos no son hermanitas de la caridad.\nPero ya que quieres entrar en detalles, que sepas que la estrategia en la región siempre ha sido eliminar a moderados y financiar extremistas, en ambos bandos. Incluido Hamás, sí. Hasta Borrell lo sabe.\nAsí que yo creo que eso deja bien claro quién no ha querido nunca la paz, si no expandirse por el territorio como una mancha de aceite.\nAsí que no, amigo, no, a pesar de todo Hamás no es en realidad el problema, es tan sólo un síntoma.\nLa raíz de la enfermedad es mucho más profunda y está bien identificada, no te preocupes.\n[#143](c143#c-143) Dices esto como si no estuviéramos financiando dictaduras (como la de Guinea Equatorial mismo) o teocracias (Israel) hoy en día. Estás alejado de la realidad.\n[#145](c145#c-145) Estoy hablando de teocracias de verdad: Arabia Saudi, o simplemente Marruecos, que lo tenemos al lado y tenemos traficantes de droga cargandose a un senior con un bate de beisbol.\n[#144](c144#c-144) Pare que sea genocidio, los israelies tendrian que estar eliminando a todo el mundo en Gaza, Jordania, Arabia Saudi, Siria, Iraq, Libano,... ... por eso no es un genocidio legalmente.\n[#35](c35#c-35) probablemente uno más especializado tipo serpiente. Capaz de liberar minidrones para escanear los túneles que encuentren.\n[#66](c66#c-66) Define \"Practicas imperialistas\". Pero si, tienes razon: Arabia Saudi mete curas whatabis en mezquitas en Europa y los hace pasar como \"libertad religiosa\", China hace lo mismo que EEUU hace 40 anios en paises en desarrollo y lo llama \"prestamos\", igual que entonces.\nCreo que en Europa no tenemos la misma mano ancha para ir a dar por culo a otros sitios porque se nos ve. Rusia o China no tienen legislacion sobre eso, y los saudies ni te cuento, que esas milicias islamistas en el Sahel no se pagan solas. Lo cojonudo e interesantisimo es quien apoya a quien: Rudia/China y los Saudies/Islam, luego tenemos a los convidados de piedra: Francia, EEUU y UK.\n[#134](c134#c-134) Que tus empresas pongan fábricas en la otra punta del mundo y contraten niños, por poner un ejemplo, es una práctica imperialista. Ya no es necesario que tu gobierno vaya poniendo colonias: ya hay un imperio en occidente y sus \"aliados\" se aprovechan.\nLas sanciones económicas, son una práctica imperialista. Los bloqueos económicos son otra práctica imperialismo. El intervencionismo, económico o militar, son prácticas imperialistas.\n[#135](c135#c-135) Que hay un imperio en occidente? Ojala.... Porque no tendriamos dictaduras teocraticas controlando recursos como el petroleo.\n[#83](c83#c-83) No, se llama emigracion. Supongo que no estas de acuerdo con devolver a todo los inmigrantes de otros paises en Espania a sus paises a menos que tengan status de refugiado.\n[#132](c132#c-132) No, se llama emigracion.\nSi es forzosa y de una etnia concreta, se llama limpieza étnica.\nSupongo que no estas de acuerdo con devolver a todo los inmigrantes de otros paises en Espania a sus paises a menos que tengan status de refugiado.\n¿Y eso qué tiene que ver con entrar en territorio de otro país y exigir que se vayan todos?\nTe respondo aunque no tenga nada que ver: Si tienen estátus de refugiado todavía estoy menos de acuerdo. Solamente si son ilegales o cometen algún crímen se debería intentar devolverlos, aunque eso no es tan sencillo. Luego otro tema es si la ley de inmigración es la adecuada, pero la ley está para cumplirla porque si no, no hay Estado de derecho.\n[#136](c136#c-136) \"Si es forzosa y de una etnia concreta, se llama limpieza étnica.\"\nLo cual no es el caso en Gaza.\n[#67](c67#c-67) este túnel ya está destruido y aún no se han enterado. Esperemos por el bien de hizbula que no haya meta información que sirva para geo posicionar las imágenes.\n[#102](c102#c-102) El GPS no suele funciona bajo tierra. En sitios con muchos edificios,algunos GPS solian fallar.\nOtra cosa es que conserve la ultima posicion desde que entro o gravo parte del exterior.\nDeberian estar entrenados para no dar esa informacion al enemigo, Pero salio notiicas de los Escoltas o alguien de seguridad publicaban en un famosa pagina web las rutas de sus entrenamientos y tamien paso con soldados USA destiandos en oriente medio.\n[#140](c140#c-140) Creo que no entiendes cual es el problema de explorar un tunel. Un dron es ideal porque se puede mover por cualquier sitio sin chocar con las paredes. Así ves lo que hay. No hay ninguna necesidad de atacar nada, que eso ya se hace después.\nLo de las comunicaciones es un problema técnico que es posible solucionar. Tampoco quieres avanzar cien metros cada vez. Está claro que no vas a usar un solo dron.\nEs único problema real de un dron es que puede pasar por encima de una trampa sin activarla.\n[#112](c112#c-112) La OTAN sí es una banda armada que existe para hacer caja.\nEl motivo del apoyo a Ucrania son las multimillonarias inversiones de Blackrock, entre otros, además de otras cuestiones estratégicas.\nEn cambio Palestina se halla bajo una amenaza existencial, están por cosas más importantes.\nAsí que, visto desde este lado, de ahí que me acuerde de ese refrán.\n[#114](c114#c-114) Y has llegado a la conclusión que yo soy pro-otan o favor de esta como exactamente? El ejemplo que das de ucrania lo suscribo totalmente.\nUna cosa no quita la otra. Hamas y grupos como Hezbollah son organizaciones mafiosas. Eso no hacen que yo este de acuerdo con la OTAN o que crea que la CIA o el Mossad son hermanitas de la caridad.\nDigo que os poneis de parte y apoyamos a grupos que se están lucrando a costa de la gente.\nNadie quiere ayudar a Palestina. Si así fuese, se hubiera dado un conflicto de inmediato con Jordania y Egipto. No es todo tan sencillo como buenos unos y malos los otros. Hay mucha gente sufriendo por la acción de israel, y muchos que podrían hacer algo en la misma región no lo hacen.\nSi hubiesen querido que palestina fuese un estado, han tenido multitud de oportunidades antes. El mensaje ahora es confuso, quieres liberar un pueblo una vez está masacrado? Si no hay un genocidio nadie te puede tomar en serio?\nPorque hace 20, 10 5 anos atras no y ahora si? Porque ahora sí que hay muchos muertos? Mirad bien que es Hamas y que quiere realmente y si su plan es para la liberación de Palestina o es otra cosa. Lo mismo con la ANP, etc:\nhttps://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Who-will-get-Arafat-s-millions-Wife-is-2637911.php\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3965541.stm\nLa familia de Arafat vive con estatus e refugiada con dinero que le asigna UNRWA ( una ong especifica para Palestinos ), tienen varias propiedades en Londres, viven entre París y Malta ( vaya! ), y la hija ni tan solo habla árabe.\nEsta gente NO quieren liberar a su pueblo, los quiere pobres e incultos para poder seguir viviendo a su costa.\nSu modo de vida es hacer del sufrimiento ajeno un negocio.\n[#120](c120#c-120) además, el fuego lo iniciaron los sionistas europeos, hace más de 75 años... y ni un solo día han dejado de meter más fuego. A lo mejor esperarán que la resistencia los reciba con pastitas y té.\n[#111](c111#c-111) Y qué cojones tiene que ver eso con meter un dron en una puta cueva con galerías de dimensiones y distribución desconocidas? O estás diciendo que todos los drones reenvían paquetes de comunicación entre cada control remoto y el dron? Y cuando pierden visibilidad entre ellos qué? anda que no habría problemas con eso también, y ni siquiera estoy seguro de que eso sea lo que estés sugiriendo... cuando a lo mejor más allá de la entrada pierdes total contacto con nada que haya dentro, por diversos motivos. En fin, que NO, que no es el \"perfecto\" sitio para atacar con drones ni de lejos.\nEsas imágenes son CGI clarísimo. Desde la animación de los personajes, las texturas, la iluminación...\n[#123](c123#c-123) te lo repito, repasate la historia de los últimos 100 años en esa zona y luego vuelve a intentar dar lecciones de moralidad .\n[#122](c122#c-122) no querer que mueran niños es ahora un argumento emocional es menester que os actualicen el firmware, porque canta a lo lejos vuestro botismo\n[#99](c99#c-99) Los argumentos te los han dado, pero vienes con protección de serie. El otro día me molesté en hacer recopilación de fuentes y de datos para un usuario con el que tenía una \"discusión\" acá. Y sabía que estaba perdiendo el tiempo, porque a pesar de que lo que le dije era notable y palmario, el tipo pedía \"datos\" y una vez que se los di, como me temía, no valió para cambiar su opinión. Simplemente desapareció pues la realidad no casaba con su argumentario (bueno, el que le habían dado desde el PSOE).\n[#113](c113#c-113) cualquier cosa para justificar que mueran niños e inocentes. Si, he pillado cuál es tu rollo y te puedes meter esos argumentos tan chulos y tan secretos por dónde te quepan",

    "title": "This Secret Sanctuary in Bodega Bay Has a Jewel Box of a Japanese Garden",
    "text": "Concealed behind a gate just steps from Highway 1 in Bodega Bay is is a jewel box of a Japanese garden, filled with meticulously sculpted cypress and pine trees, a flowering cherry, a dry stone river—even a tiny teahouse. It’s the result of owner and gallerist Ren Brown’s lifelong passion for the art and culture of Japan.\nBrown and his late husband, Robert DeVee, moved to Bodega Bay in 1989 to open a gallery dedicated to Japanese art. The couple quickly found a location—a well-lit space with frontage along Highway 1 to capture coastal visitor traffic. Fortunately, just behind the gallery was a sturdily built, though rather dated, cottage.\nRealizing their luck, the couple bought the property and made plans to remodel the home. Both home and garden now incorporate Japanese design principles and aesthetics. Outside, that means a restful, peaceful garden with such hallmarks as a rock garden, carefully trimmed evergreens, bonsai, and wabi-sabi stone footbridges. Inside, the Japanese touches include shoji screens, tatami mats, and antique tansu chests of every size to display Brown’s collection of Japanese ceramics.\n“It’s what I love,” says Brown.\nThough Brown grew up in the East Bay, his childhood was steeped in the culture of Japan. His mother had been born and raised there, the daughter of a Presbyterian missionary who traveled throughout Japan’s smallest island on horseback to convert the locals. As a young college graduate, Brown’s father traveled to Japan during the Depression, looking for teaching work. His father later earned a doctorate in Japanese history and taught the subject at UC Berkeley for many years.\n“I was always surrounded by Japanese visitors coming to the house, Japanese art and ceramics,”says Brown.\nFrom the mundane to the sacred\nHis tranquil courtyard garden, completely enclosed by a wooden fence, feels worlds away from the highway just beyond. One enters through a traditional torii gate, a gate commonly found at the entrance to or within a Shinto shrine, symbolically marking the transitional step from the mundane world to the sacred one.\nThe torii at the entrance to Brown’s garden was made by Sonoma County sculptor Bruce Johnson. Brown first became familiar with Johnson’s piece when he was curating an exhibit at Sebastopol Center for the Arts. The exhibit was meant to allow the local Japanese American community to show appreciation for those who supported them while they were incarcerated during World War II.\nThe torii, which features hammered metal and redwood and a sculpted juniper tree growing in the middle, is angled to frame a view of the garden. It centers on the pond, where shimmering koi glide peacefully through the water and the gentle sound of a small waterfall echoes peacefully among the stones.\nIn the jewel box space, serpentine stone pathways lead past water features and plantings of Japanese maples, now mostly bare in the winter season.\nThere’s a small dry-gravel garden, much like ones seen in Japanese homes and temples in Kyoto. The raking of the gravel around the islands of stone is a meditative, cleansing ritual, particularly after a winter rain.\nMasterly sculpted evergreens\nPrecisely sculpted evergreens are a fundamental feature of traditional Japanese gardens. To shape his trees, Brown sought out Michael Alliger, a master aesthetic pruner who for many years has also maintained the exquisite garden at Osmosis Day Spa in Freestone.\nAlliger says that while Brown’s garden is smaller than the one at Osmosis, it is very authentic in both hardscape and in the palette of plants and koi. Standout specimen trees, winding paths that reveal new views around each small bend, and the innovative use of stone are all hallmarks of traditional Japanese garden design, explains Alliger.\nJapanese black pines and other specimen trees are carefully trimmed to open up the branches and showcase the trunk and branching structure. The pruning isn’t hard, says Alliger, but it does take a lot of focus, concentration, and timing.\nEach season has its own beauty\nWinter reveals details that might be missed at other times of the year: the shape of branches bare of leaves, delicate catkins cascading down from the twisted walking-stick tree. Even the borrowed scenery: a reflection of sky and hillside on water, or a glimpse of the coast over the garden wall, seems more vivid in winter. Brown says that the garden receives less moisture than gardens do in Japan, so the moss isn’t as lush as it might be, but there are softened edges of green that might not be as apparent in summertime.\n“The garden has beauty every month of the year,” says Brown. “There are different things that bloom, new views revealed. But the strength and power of the shaped tree is what holds everything together and makes it unified.”\nBrown often reminds himself to slow down and take time to enjoy the serenity of the space.\n“Too often, gardeners find themselves focusing on all the things to do—the deadheading and the weeding. They don’t spend time just enjoying,” he says. “Japanese garden styles are meant to make you slow down—to take the sharply angled path, to follow around the corner, to take in that next view. You’re compelled to breathe it in.”\nVisiting the gallery and garden\nGallery owner Ren Brown will happily share his garden with gallery guests who would like share in the space’s serenity.\n“The whole point of a gallery is to offer beauty, and the garden is another way of doing that,” says Brown. “We often find that people who come to visit the gallery can enjoy the art even more after spending a few minutes in the garden.”\nRen Brown’s gallery of Japanese art features rotating exhibits of ceramics, works on paper, and other finds and is open year-round, 10 a.m.5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday.\nThe Ren Brown Collection, 1781 Highway 1, Bodega Bay. 707-875-2922,\nrenbrown.com",

    "title": "En Savoie, Gonthier espaces verts et piscines verdit ses pratiques - Journal du Bâtiment et des TP",
    "text": "Pour ses 50 ans, [Gonthier, spécialiste de l'aménagement d'espaces verts et de la réalisation de piscines* à Cognin](https://mesinfos.fr/73000-chambery/savoie-regeneterre-reconstitue-de-la-terre-vegetale-en-mode-durable-200923.html), s'est lancé dans une profonde remise en question en participant à la Conférence des entreprises pour le climat, aboutissant à des choix courageux, à une feuille de route intitulée Cap 2030. Consciente qu'en travaillant avec le vivant, et même dans le vivant, l'entreprise pouvait avoir un impact positif mais aussi négatif sur celui-ci. Christophe et Jérôme Gonthier se sont alors posé cette question : \"Comment faire évoluer nos aménagements au service du vivant sans sacrifier les aspects esthétiques et pratiques ?\". En gardant en tête que ce virage pouvait engendrer pénibilité et insatisfaction pour les équipes sur le terrain. Et qu'il fallait aussi convaincre les clients de se tourner vers des plantes endémiques plutôt que d'opter pour des palmiers, par exemple. L'équipe a déterminé cinq leviers d'action. \"Il faut d'abord revoir notre offre de conception réalisation pour réduire de manière continue notre empreinte carbone\", commence Thomas Dury, directeur adjoint études et projets. Puis donner envie aux clients, collectivités, particuliers, entreprises, de revoir leurs attentes en matière d'espaces extérieurs, à travers la transformation du showroom en jardin à impact positif, qui sert, par la même occasion, de zone test. Il s'agit aussi de convertir les sites entretenus en refuges pour la biodiversité. Tout cela impose une montée en compétence des équipes, de nouvelles pratiques, des formations en agronomie, écologie, connaissance du vivant. Gonthier repense les usages et fonctionnalités de la piscine Et, bien sûr, rediriger l'offre piscine : construire différemment, rénover les piscines en les améliorant, et transformer les usages et le concept. \"Que les piscines soient au service du vivant, ne servent pas uniquement à se baigner, et peut-être qu'elles soient collectives, plus seulement individuelles mais à l'échelle d'un quartier\", propose Christophe Gonthier. \"Aujourd'hui, nous n'avons pas toutes les solutions\", clame Camille Jugand, directeur du service piscine. Trouver une alternative au chlore n'est pas aisé. Même si des pistes sont à l'étude. Réduire la consommation en eau peut être rendu possible par l'installation d'une cuve de rétention, récupérant l'eau de toiture et de piscine pour assurer le réassort. Quid de l'électricité ? Déjà, ne plus pousser à l'achat d'une pompe à chaleur. Ensuite, réfléchir à l'énergie solaire ou hydroélectrique (turbine). \"Les barrières aujourd'hui, ce sont les normes\", lance Christophe Gonthier. Suivre ce Cap 2030, c'est aussi se fermer des marchés porteurs qui ne collent pas avec cette nouvelle démarche. \"Il y a un an et demi, on nous a proposé de nous lancer dans les terrains de sport. Ça paraît sympa de prime abord et puis il faut considérer le fait qu'on est passé du naturel au synthétique. C'est la première fois que je décline une opportunité économique par rapport à ce Cap 2030\", confie l'entrepreneur. Combien cet engagement coûte-t-il à l'entreprise ? \"Nous n'avons pas établi de feuille de route économique. Tant que l'entreprise est viable, on estime que c'est correct. On veut simplement ne pas perdre de salarié.\" *La partie espaces verts génère 8 millions d'euros de chiffre d'affaires et emploie 48 personnes, contre respectivement 2 millions d'euros et dix personnes pour la partie piscine. Des exemples de pratiques régénératives Avoir un impact positif peut se traduire par le choix de végétaux supportant le stress hydrique, qui présentent un intérêt nourricier ou d'abri pour la faune. \"L'entreprise travaille à 90 % avec des pépinières locales\", précise Elodie Grangeat, responsable des achats. C'est aussi se donner pour objectif le zéro surface imperméable grâce à des solutions minérales, le bois et le dallage, la végétalisation et le paillage. C'est remettre l'eau (mare) au cœur des jardins pour ramener la faune, conserver des zones où la nature reprend ses droits, créer davantage de zones de forêt, moins tondre. Ou encore végétaliser les façades, jouant un rôle thermique, esthétique et favorable à la biodiversité. C'est intégrer des matériaux de réemploi, recadrer la politique d'achat en optant pour la sobriété, la transversalité et l'économie circulaire.",

    "text": "While Rachael Gunn aka Raygun‘s Olympics performance in the new Breakdancing category will likely live on in infamy\nin memes, you won’t be able to rewatch her on Peacock.\nThat’s because the streaming service that has been home to the Olympics is no longer home to recaps of the sport, which won’t be returning for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\nMeanwhile, while Gunn’s performance was widely mocked — primarily because it was free of most of the signature moves associated with the dance form that got its start in the South Bronx — she\nmaintains, “I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics.”\nShe continued on her Instagram, “While I went out there and I had fun, I did take it very seriously.”\n“I really appreciate the positivity, and I’m glad I was able to bring some joy into your lives. That’s what I hoped,” Gunn expressed. “I didn’t realize that that would also open the door to so much hate, which has, frankly, been pretty devastating.”\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
