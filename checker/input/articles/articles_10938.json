    "text": "Gold has surged to new highs amid persistent overnight buying from Asia, with volumes well above average. Goldman Sachs highlights that despite the rally, positioning is not yet stretched. Their bullish year-end forecast now stands at $3,700/oz, with a $4,500/oz tail-risk scenario under potential Fed policy shifts.\nKey Points:\nAsian Buying Momentum:\nSpot gold broke Monday’s highs, marking eight consecutive overnight rallies driven by strong Asia session demand.Elevated Volumes:\nTrading volumes are currently running ~40% above the 10-session average at this time of day.Positioning Still Roomy:\nCFTC, ETF, and open interest data indicate speculative positioning is not yet extended, suggesting room for further upside.Goldman’s Upgraded Outlook:\nGS recently raised their 2025 year-end forecast to $3,700/oz, citing:Increased ETF inflows\nContinued central bank buying\nElevated geopolitical and macro uncertainty\nTail Scenario:\nIf the Fed is forced to subordinate policy due to debt concerns or US reserve currency shifts, GS sees gold potentially spiking to $4,500/oz.\nConclusion:\nGoldman views the current rally as sustainable, with strong physical demand and investor inflows from Asia underpinning the move. Positioning remains far from euphoric, supporting their constructive outlook, while macro risks could trigger a super-spike scenario in the months ahead.\nFor bank trade ideas, check out eFX Plus.

    "title": "Clinical trials: How patients and scientists team up to fight cancer",
    "text": "Sudbury residents were told this week how the Health Sciences North Research Institute (HSNRI) is making progress in helping cancer patients get through their treatments and have better outcomes. A public event at Science North's Vale Cavern was held Thursday to let people know the importance of the work being done by HSNRI, especially with respect to cancer care. Many might not realize the level of state-of-the-art cancer research being conducted in the Nickel City, or that local cancer patients can sign up to participate in clinical trials of treatments in Sudbury. One person who is well aware of the importance of cancer research and how much research is being conducted locally is Amanda Snyder, a clinical research study coordinator in cancer research at Health Sciences North, who works closely with HSNRI. Through that role, Snyder works with cancer patients participating in clinical trials, helping them through their treatment by providing them with relevant information and support. Clinical trials, she said, give patients access to cutting-edge treatments under development, giving them better patient outcomes, but also helping drive cancer research forward. \"So we currently have 10 open trials. They range from academic studies to radiation trials to investigational drug trials,\" said Snyder. \"Whether it's a better outcome for overall survival or overall symptom management is usually what we're aiming to alleviate.\" Snyder added that the drug trials or radiation trials local patients participate in are all carefully scrutinized by ethics boards and formally approved by such organizations as Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ). \"What the patients are getting, you know, essentially are cutting-edge treatments … that just haven't come to market yet,\" said Snyder. As an example, she mentioned one study done in Sudbury for patients who had oral mucositis , which is a complication from radiation therapy. Snyder said the condition is one of the unpleasant things that can happen to cancer patients who are on a regimen of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It can cause a series of mouth ulcers that make it difficult for people to eat or drink. In many cases, patients need to be fed by a G-tube (gastrostomy tube). She said the drug trial allowed staff to provide medication to enable patients to eat and drink and not live in pain for several weeks during the chemo and radiation treatments. Snyder said this also made it easier for the patients in that most did not need to be admitted for hospital care during the course of their treatments. Plus, patients’ participation helps push research forward. \"It was kind of a dual purpose of the study, and it was actually really cool how the medication did benefit the patients in the long term.” She said the success of the study also had FDA representatives coming to Sudbury to monitor the results. \"It worked out really, really well,\" Snyder said. \"This was the first time the FDA actually came to our site to monitor the study.” She added that she is not sure if the data collected by the FDA from other hospitals was as positive as what happened in Sudbury, but she said it was an example of the importance of the work being done. Snyder added that HSN anticipates the FDA will be returning at some point in the future to monitor other studies underway at the hospital. Snyder said not all patients fully grasp the importance of the research work or that participating in a clinical trial could benefit them in their cancer treatment. Snyder said when patients learn they have cancer, they have a lot of information to absorb and being told about research studies can lead to information overload for people who are already having to take in a lot of info. Snyder said it helps when patients have a lot of family support, especially if there is a health care person in the family, to help patients understand the potential long-term benefits of getting involved with a clinical trial. Snyder said she tries to put herself in a patient's shoes, so she can understand how overwhelming it might be when they are being told of the many things they could do or should do. She said one of the key benefits is that when a patient is selected to be part of a clinical trial, their level of care goes up. It usually results in one-on-one direct nursing care, Snyder said. \"So we're with them all of the time, bringing them to where they need to be so that they're not feeling overwhelmed or lost at any time, that everything's pretty seamless for them in that sense,\" said Snyder.

    "title": "Valspar Championship: PGA Tour pros playing through brutal conditions - SBNation.com",
    "text": "The Tampa Bay area is no stranger to inclement weather, as harsh conditions continue to impact play at this week’s [Valspar Championship](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/21/24107663/justin-thomas-valspar-championship-post-tiger-woods-era). Scores during the second round have ballooned thanks to the 30-mile-per-hour winds blowing across the golf course. Rain is also expected to impact play during the afternoon wave. “Anything under today was a heck of a round,” said [Lucas Glover](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/9/24095524/pga-news-lucas-glover-trashes-liv-golf-response-signature-event), who carded a 2-under 69 on Friday morning. “Anything around par today was a heck of a round.” The Copperhead Course at Innisbrook hosts the Valspar Championship each year, and it routinely stumps the field thanks to its difficulty. Throw in severe weather, and the Valspar Championship now resembles major championship scoring. “It’s such a chess game today, hole by hole,” added first-round leader Kevin Streelman, who shot a 1-over 72 on Friday. “Definitely a grinding round... On courses like this and days like this, you’re not pumping it as hard as you can down the fairway. It’s more of missing it in the right spots a lot of times. It’s all about angles. It’s about not getting yourself into certain positions that are so difficult to be in.” Streelman carded a brilliant 7-under 64 on Thursday, a round that featured seven birdies and zero bogies. He also led the field in strokes gained approaching the green during the first round, an essential attribute of this course. The Copperhead Course, much like [TPC Sawgrass](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/12/24097805/pga-tour-players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-toughest-4-holes), is a ball-strikers course. But during Friday’s blustery second round, Streelman struggled to gain momentum. As of this writing, he shares the lead at 6-under with Chandler Phillips. “I knew it would be a very challenging day, and it’s Friday, so I’m not really too worried about leaderboards anyway; really try to wait until Sunday afternoon,” the 45-year-old Streelman added. “You just have to take what the course can give you. It’s not giving you much right now.” Indeed, the course has not offered any reprieve for the players. “Windy day. Pretty hard conditions. But I tried to be patient,” added K.H. Lee, who shot a 4-under 67 to shoot up to 4-under overall. “I tried more to play smart, more center of green, and sometimes if I had a good number, I attacked the pin.” Patience is another key to success at this golf course, often regarded as the most underrated on the PGA Tour. “I think this place, you understand that not all the holes are really attackable, especially on a day like today where it’s, let’s get in the fairway first, and then we’ll go from there, that type of thing,” Glover added. “I did a nice job of that today. My only bogey was because I missed the fairway, and that’s what this place can do to you.” Many notable players struggled on Friday, with no one more so than [Kevin Kisner](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/1/6/24027939/kevin-kisner-nbc-analyst-debut-the-sentry-fans-vibing), who signed for a 4-over 75. He opened with a 9-over 80, and will thus miss the cut. So, too, will young Aussie [Min Woo Lee](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2023/10/18/23921702/tom-kim-min-woo-lee-golf-next-2-international-superstars), who also shot a 4-over 75 on Friday. But [Jordan Spieth](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/2/1/24057638/pga-news-jordan-spieth-saudi-pif-liv-golf-ssg-deal), who missed the cut last week at [The Players](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/18/24105321/scottie-scheffler-win-playing-through-nails-the-players-pick), is in danger of missing the weekend once more. He shot a 3-over 74 Friday and is currently 1-over for the championship. Spieth is currently on the outside looking in, but that could change as the wind continues to blow across the golf course Friday. And yet, it does not appear the blustery conditions will subside anytime soon, so who knows how the second round will play out. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation’s Playing Through.

    "text": "Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) have developed an innovative method to study ultrafast magnetism in materials. They have shown the generation and application of magnetic field steps, in which a magnetic field is turned on in a matter of picoseconds.\nMagnetic fields are fundamental to controlling the magnetization of materials. Under static or slowly varying conditions, a material's magnetization aligns with the external field like a compass needle. However, entirely new magnetization dynamics emerge when magnetic fields change on ultrafast timescales -- faster than the material's response time. These rapid transients are of great interest for fundamental research into non-equilibrium states of matter and for potential applications in next-generation magnetic memory, where faster writing speeds are critical.\nTo address this challenge, the research team designed a novel superconducting device capable of producing ultrafast, unipolar magnetic field steps -- sudden magnetic changes with picosecond-scale rise and super-nanosecond decay times. \"Our goal is to create a universal, ultrafast stimulus that can switch any magnetic sample between stable magnetic states,\" says lead author Giovanni De Vecchi. \"This breakthrough could drive advances in both fundamental science and technology.\"\nHarnessing Superconductors for Ultrafast Magnetic Steps\nThe team, led by Andrea Cavalleri, achieved this feat by rapidly quenching supercurrents in a superconducting YBa₂Cu₃O₇ thin disc exposed to an external magnetic field. Supercurrents naturally form to expel magnetic fields from superconductors. \"By abruptly disrupting these currents using ultrashort laser pulses, we could generate ultrafast magnetic field steps with rise times of approximately one picosecond -- one trillionth of a second,\" says fellow co-author Gregor Jotzu.\n\"Devising a method to track these magnetic transients in real-time was a major challenge,\" explains co-author Michele Buzzi. The researchers placed a spectator crystal near the superconducting sample to achieve this. The crystal's optical properties change in response to the local magnetic field. This effect allows the team to track the magnetic field evolution by analyzing the polarization rotation of a femtosecond laser pulse. \"With this approach, we achieved sub-picosecond resolution and unprecedented sensitivity,\" adds co-author Sebastian Fava.\nTowards Ultrafast Magnetic Switching\nWhile the current magnetic steps do not yet achieve complete magnetization switching, the researchers believe optimizing the device geometry could enhance the amplitude and speed of the magnetic field transients. \"With suitable improvements, we envision applications ranging from phase transition control to complete switching of magnetic order parameters,\" says Andrea Cavalleri.\nThe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft supported the study through the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter. The MPSD is a member of the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), a joint enterprise with DESY and the University of Hamburg. The research was conducted in collaboration with Alexey Kimel, Professor at Radboud University.\nhere.",

The Northtowns\nreceived a dusting or less.\nBut dozens of schools in the region closed across the board, regardless of geography.\n\"It's a tough decision. We monitored the weather all day,\" said Mike Ginestre, Superintendent of Sweet Home Central Schools on WBEN. \"We were not sure how far North the snow band would go.\"\nHe said snow is not the only factor.\n\"It's also getting our staff into school, which is not only teachers, but bus drivers and aides.\"\nGinestre said there is something else.\n\"When the governor proclaimed a state of emergency in Erie County, we wanted to make sure that our students were safe, as well as faculty and staff.\"\nDid the state of emergency influence the decision to close schools?\n\"It does play a factor,\" he admitted. \"These significant weather events seem to be happening more and more. When we have a state of emergency, it gives us a little protection when it comes to aid. We have to be in school a certain amount of days to claim our state aid. So, when that state of emergency is issued, if we use all of our emergency days, (typically five per year), we have that as a tool to reclaim aid.\"\nSweet Home staff is spread throughout Western New York. It can be a challenge for many of them to get to work on snowy days.\nGinestre said there is also a teacher shortage and a shortage of substitute teachers in the district and he has to consider staffing when it snows, to make sure that he has the proper coverage.\n\"It's not an easy decision, but safety is number one.\"\n4",

    "text": "„Würden sonst Deutsch sprechen“: Trump gibt bizarre Erklärung für Militärparade\nEine gigantische Militärparade rollt an Trumps Geburtstag durch Washington DC. Die Feier will sich der Präsident auf keinen Fall vermiesen lassen.\nWashington, D.C. – Während Demonstranten an der Westküste gegen die Abschiebepolitik von Donald Trump protestieren, laufen an der Ostküste längst die Vorbereitungen für die Militärparade. Am Samstag (14. Juni 2025) sollen Panzer und Kriegsgerät begleitet von hunderttausenden Soldaten durch Washington DC rollen, um sowohl den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee als auch den 79. Geburtstag des amtierenden US-Präsidenten zu feiern.\nDoch die Eskalation in Los Angeles macht Donald Trump mit Blick auf die geplanten Feierlichkeiten am Wochenende offenbar nervös. „Haben Sie eine Botschaft an die Kritiker der Feierlichkeiten?“, fragte ein Journalist den US-Präsidenten bei einem Presse-Meeting im Weißen Haus. „Wenn irgendjemand zum Demonstrieren auftaucht, dann werden wir ihm mit sehr großer Gewalt begegnen“, sagte Trump und wiederholte die Drohung sogar noch einmal. „Jeder, der demonstrieren will, wird mit sehr großer Gewalt empfangen“. Ihm seien aber keine geplanten Proteste gegen seine Militärparade bekannt.\nDonald Trump schwärmt von „Panzern“ bei der Militärparade\nDer Plan der US-Regierung für Samstag sieht eine gigantische Show der eigenen Stärke in Washington, DC vor. „Wir haben Panzer, Flugzeuge, wir haben alles mögliche“, schwärmte Donald Trump bereits im Vorfeld über die geplante Militärparade. Nach aktuellen Informationen sollen an dieser mehr als 200.000 Soldatinnen und Soldaten teilnehmen. Daneben werden Panzer, Flugzeuge und Militärgerät aller Art aus verschiedenen Epochen in Washington zu sehen sein.\nDonald Trumps Militärparade: Infos zur Geburtstagsfeier in der Übersicht\nDatum | 14. Juni 2025 |\nBeginn | 18.30 Uhr Ortszeit (0.30 Uhr in Deutschland) |\nThema | Die Kriege der USA |\nUmfang | mehr als 100 Militärfahrzeuge und bis zu 200.000 Soldaten |\nDie US-Armee will mit der Militärparade in Washington DC an alle Konflikte erinnern, die das Land seit seiner Gründung erlebte: vom Revolutionskrieg über die Weltkriege bis zum Vietnam-Krieg. Jeder Krieg wird von 60 Soldaten in historischen Kostümen repräsentiert, gefolgt von 400 Soldaten der gleichen Einheit in ihren modernen Kampfanzügen. Außerdem werden hunderte Militärfahrzeuge in Washington DC erwartet. Die Parade dürfte damit anhand der Bilder, die durch die Welt gehen werden, stark an Russlands jährliche Militärparaden erinnern.\nPanzer und Hubschrauber bei der Militärparade in Washington DC\n- M1A2/Abrams-Panzer\n- Bradley-Kampffahrzeuge\n- Black Hawk-Hubschrauber\n- Apache-Hubschrauber\n- Chinook-Hubschrauber\nDer Prunk zum Doppelgeburtstag kostet die US-Politik offenbar eine Stange Geld. Bis zu 45 Millionen US-Dollar sollen laut US-Medien die geplanten Ausgaben für die Militärparade und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in Washington DC betragen. Donald Trump aber hat dafür eine Begründung parat. „Zur Abwechslung werden wir unser Land mal feiern“, sagte Trump. Die USA seien das einzige Land, das seinen Sieg im Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht feiern würde. „Ich habe andere Länder angerufen. Alle feiern es. Dabei sind wir diejenigen, die den Krieg gewonnen haben. Ohne uns würden Sie alle sonst heute Deutsch sprechen. Vielleicht würden Sie auch Japanisch sprechen.“\nDonald Trump bekommt die lang ersehnte Militärparade zum Geburtstag\nDie Militärparade in Washington DC an Donald Trumps Geburtstag ist der Höhepunkt der Feier zu Ehren des US-Militärs, die bereits seit Montag (7. Juni) laufen. Der amtierende US-Präsident hatte bereits nach seinem Sieg bei der US-Wahl 2016 eine Militärparade in der Hauptstadt verlangt. Die Behörden des „District of Colombia“ hatten das aber verhindert, weil Kosten und logistischer Aufwand als zu hoch eingeschätzt wurden. Nun aber bekommt Donald Trump seine Militärparade. Das verdankt der US-Präsident wohl der Tatsache, dass seine zweite Amtszeit den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee umschließt.\nDoch die anhaltenden Proteste gegen Trumps Abschiebepolitik in Los Angeles dürften dessen Vorfreude auf die Militärparade trüben. Laut einem Bericht der New York Times mache man sich auch innerhalb der Republikaner große Sorgen, die Bilder von Panzern und Soldaten in der US-Hauptstadt könnten im Angesicht der Unruhen in Kalifornien ein falsches Bild erzeugen. Es könne der Eindruck entstehen, die US-Armee würde den Sieg über die eigene Bevölkerung feiern. „Das unglückliche Zusammentreffen der Parade und des Einsatzes der Nationalgarde in Kalifornien wird sich verhängnisvoll anfühlen“, sagte Kori Schake, ehemaliger Verteidigungsbeamter in der Regierung von George W. Bush, gegenüber der US-Zeitung.\nMilitärparade in Washington DC: Trump hält Rede zu Ehren der US-Armee\nDas wiederum dürfte Donald Trump aber nicht abschrecken. Der amtierende US-Präsident ist ein Meister der Selbstinszenierung und wird die Militärparade am 14. Juni vor allem dafür nutzen, um sich und seinen Geburtstag zu feiern. Auch eine Rede Trumps ist geplant. Laut der Website der Veranstaltung will das Staatsoberhaupt „250 Jahre außergewöhnliche Dienste, bedeutende Errungenschaften und ein bleibendes Vermächtnis der US-Armee“ ehren.\nOffiziell sind die Feierlichkeiten und der Soldatenaufmarsch in Washington DC aber nicht für Donald Trumps Geburtstag gedacht. Geehrt wird am „nationalen Flaggentag“ dagegen nur das Militär. Vor 250 Jahren, am 14. Juni 1775, hob der Kontinentalkongress im laufenden Unabhängigkeitskrieg zehn Kompanien aus. Der spätere US-Präsident George Washington wurde zum Oberbefehlshaber der so gebildeten Kontinentalarmee ernannt.\nDamit ist die US-Armee sogar älter als die USA selbst. Die wurde nämlich erst am 4. Juli 1776 mit Unterzeichnung der Unabhängigkeitserklärung ins Leben gerufen. Noch jünger ist Donald Trump. Der feiert am 14. Juni 2025 erst seinen 79. Geburtstag und ist damit nach Joe Biden der zweitälteste amtierende Präsident in der 250 Jahre dauernden Geschichte der USA. Sollte er seine Amtszeit beenden, würde Trump seinen Vorgänger noch überholen, und mit dann 82 Jahren und sieben Monaten zum ältesten US-Staatsoberhaupt der Geschichte werden. (dil)",
