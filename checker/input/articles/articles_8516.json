    "text": "The two-year-old son of famed Canadian producer David Foster and singer Katharine McPhee is lighting up the internet with his musical talents. In a video posted to TikTok by McPhee and Instagram by Foster, the pair’s son is seen playing an impressive drum solo alongside a recording of Michael Jackson’s song “Rock with You.” Foster is seen in the video seated watching his son, bopping his head along to the beat while the two-year-old rocks out on a mini drum set complete with his name, Rennie Foster, splashed across the bass drum. McPhee’s video included the caption “my 2 year old baby is a genius.” Foster, the 74-year-old musician and composer, is a 16-time Grammy winner who was born in Victoria. He married McPhee, a 39-year-old singer and actress who was the runner-up in the 2006 season of American Idol, in 2019. Celebrities like Kristin Chenoweth, Questlove, Nicole Sherzinger, Joey McIntyre, Sharon Stone, Debra Messing, Charlie Puth and others took to the video comments to hype up the young drummer.

    "text": "States » NorthPosted at: Jul 19 2024 11:17AM Sweet success: Kashmiri farmer's watermelon dream bears fruitSrinagar, July 19 (UNI) In the picturesque village of Wantarak Chak, six km from Mattan in south Kashmir's Anantnag district, a 45-year-old farmer, Mohammad Aslam Khan, has turned his long-cherished dream into a reality as he has successfully grown hybrid watermelons on a commercial scale, attracting a lot of attention and admiration. Khan's journey began in 2008 when he started growing watermelons on a small plot of land on a trial basis. Encouraged by the good crop and financial benefits, he gradually increased the plantation area to 16 kanals. Today, his watermelons are in high demand, and other farmers in the village have also started growing them on over 80 kanals of land. What sets Khan's watermelons apart is their unique taste, color, and size. “They are sweeter, fully red, and can weigh up to 20 kgs. Although the current crop is slightly smaller, weighing around 13 kgs, I am confident that the size will increase with time,” Khan said. The Agriculture Department has played a significant role in Khan's success, providing him with a hi-tech poly house for preparing nursery and hybrid seeds. The department's support has not only benefited Khan but also other farmers in the area who are now keen to grow watermelons. According to Chief Agriculture Officer Anantnag Aijaz Hussain Dar, this is the first time that watermelons have been grown on a commercial basis in the district. He believes that if more farmers take up this crop, Kashmiri watermelons could be exported to other parts of the country at good rates, given their unique taste and availability during the off-season. “This sweet and juicy fruit is not available anywhere else in India during the July-August period, making it a unique offering from the region. If we can increase the output and more farmers join in, we'll soon be exporting our watermelons to other parts of the country at attractive rates,\" he said. As the demand for his produce continues to grow, Khan says he remains committed to providing high-quality watermelons to his customers, ensuring that his dream bears fruit for years to come.

    "text": "A little under a year ago my friend brought me back a beer from [3 Sons Brewing Company](https://www.3sonsbrewingco.com/), out of Dania Beach, Florida. And, [since it was so good](https://www.hustlebelt.com/belts-beer-garden/2023/2/3/23583953/belts-beer-garden-so-dope), I have made it a mission to get my hands on more of their beers. Well that day has finally come, as I was able to snag a can of their All Star. All Star is a hazy Pale Ale that was double dry-hopped with 100% Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand’s [Freestyle Hops](https://www.norfolk.net.nf/). It features a solid 5.5% ABV and I was able to get each 16-ounce can for about $6. The brew poured a cloudy, yet bright, golden straw color with minimal head building up. The eggshell white foam barely measured a finger tall and was quite light, disappearing almost instantly. After about 30 seconds, all that remained was a single cloud in the middle and one or two bubbles along the edge of the glass, with no lacing what-so-ever. On the nose, the beer was light and inviting with a blend of hoppy characteristics. The Nelson hops offered up fruity notes of white grapes, citrus, and grapefruit rind along with an herbal and resinous dankness that had a twinge of diesel. Quite the combination for such a light beer. My first sip was, as expected, quite light. It had a thin and watery feel but packed a bunch of flavor! And it mirrored the aroma almost exactly. There were big bursts of juicy citrus fruits, like tangerine and papaya, that marched side by side with the sparkling grape flavor that Nelson hops are known for. But, as with the smell, there were also massive spikes of dank diesel and some resinous grassy flavors. And it seemed to switch every sip and nearly every few seconds as to which flavor profile you would get more of. It was an epic and tasty battle that played out on your very own taste buds. Usually Nelson hopped beers can end rather pithy and dry but All Star does not. It finishes super cleanly. Towards the bottom of the pint, there was a bit of grapefruit peel and dryness that lingered for a second or two but, for the vast majority of it, this was a super clean brew. Overall, this was a delightful Pale Ale that really showcased the two sides of hops in each and every sip. Those two sides fought back and forth as to which would lead…sometimes the fruits would win, sometimes the dankness would win. But no matter which flavor combination led the way, your taste buds won. This was a damn good beer.",
