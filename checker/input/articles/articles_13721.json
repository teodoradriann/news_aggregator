    "text": "'Wolf in sheep's clothing': Report flags Starlink's US military ties Starlink operates through a constellation of satellites to provide internet access worldwide, a model distinct from traditional telecom services that rely on ground-based towers. In Short - Kutniti report warns of Starlink's US military ties - India demands Starlink's compliance with security norms - Caution urged over Starlink's geopolitical influence When Elon Musk’s Starlink appears on the horizon, it might seem like just another internet provider promising global connectivity. But is there more to this satellite constellation than meets the eye? As Starlink is hustling to launch in India,[ a report by think tank Kutniti Foundation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kBfl5sl88Y2mlRgvMl1zzaqljOjY23BU/view) warns that Elon Musk's company is a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and could bring more than just high-speed internet to the table. The report highlights Starlink's deep ties with US military and intelligence agencies, raising questions about national security. With satellite technology unbound by geographic boundaries, could Starlink be offering a fast lane to the American government’s global reach? STARLINK’S TECHNOLOGY AND CONCERNS Starlink operates through a constellation of satellites to provide internet access worldwide, a model distinct from traditional telecom services that rely on ground-based towers. However, Kutniti's report points out that the satellites are controlled from outside India, raising sovereignty concerns as Starlink would allow direct access to Indian users without local governance over its infrastructure. Kutniti describes the service as “a new form of internet provider” that can bypass geographic and political boundaries, noting that “the American government, through Starlink, gains access to every citizen without an intermediary governance structure.” This unrestricted reach, according to Kutniti, could potentially be used to serve US military interests, citing the fact that the “biggest customer and promoter” of Starlink has been the American intelligence and military sectors. INDIA’S RESPONSE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS India’s Communications Minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said on Tuesday that Starlink must comply with India’s security norms before it can receive a licence for satellite broadband services. While the minister acknowledged Starlink’s application to enter the Indian market, he highlighted that no services would be permitted until all regulatory conditions are met. As of now, Starlink has not responded to Kutniti’s claims or clarified its stance on meeting India’s regulatory requirements. The company has previously expressed interest in expanding satellite internet services to rural and remote regions, positioning itself as a solution for areas with limited internet access. CONNECTIONS TO US DEFENCE AND INTELLIGENCE Kutniti highlights Starlink’s close association with the US government, particularly intelligence and military agencies. Elon Musk’s aerospace company, SpaceX, is reportedly involved in constructing a network of satellites under a classified contract with a US intelligence agency. According to the report, there are several confidential agreements between Starlink and the US defence sector, suggesting a strong link between Musk’s companies and American military interests. The report also notes that Musk has faced political controversies in the US over Starlink’s role in international conflicts. For instance, he declined a request from Ukraine to use Starlink’s satellite network for military purposes, which stirred debate over his influence and control over a technology that could impact global events. KUTNITI’S CALL FOR CAUTION Kutniti Foundation warns that Musk’s business dealings, including his connections with private intelligence companies and his political visibility in the US, should prompt caution from India. The report mentions Musk’s alleged ties with organisations like Palantir Technologies, known for its close association with American intelligence. Furthermore, it points out that Starlink’s technology has been used in politically sensitive regions like Brazil, Ukraine, and Iran, sometimes without considering the sovereignty of these nations, according to Kutniti. The foundation claims that Starlink’s reach extends beyond internet services, potentially allowing it to provide high-definition satellite images and live video feeds. Kutniti suggests that Starlink is a tool of “geopolitical control,” developed to maintain American dominance in space and, by extension, influence over other countries. IMPACT ON INDIA AND CALL FOR SECURITY MEASURES Kutniti recommends that India exercise caution and enforce strict security checks if Starlink is allowed to enter the country. The think tank mentions that India’s interests must be safeguarded against foreign entities with military and intelligence affiliations. It further calls attention to US policies, which, as outlined in the report, could mandate US companies to act in ways that enhance American security and economic interests.",

Hasta la fecha, FEMA ha obligado unos $33,900 millones para cerca de 11,000 proyectos de recuperación en Puerto Rico tras el paso del huracán María. “Los fondos de FEMA aportan a infraestructura esencial como la que nos provee agua y energía, pero también contribuyen a una recreación diversa para todas las edades. Nuestra isla cuenta con turismo verde, recreativo, educativo y cultural, y la agencia sostiene su compromiso con los proyectos que siguen su curso de reconstrucción para que podamos disfrutar de estos espacios durante todo el año”, indicó José G. Baquero, coordinador federal de Recuperación por Desastres. Aquí se presentan cuatro de los lugares restaurados y compartidos por la agencia federal. Por su parte, el director ejecutivo de la Oficina Central de Recuperación, Reconstrucción y Resiliencia ( [Cor3](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/cor3/), en inglés), Manuel Laboy, sostuvo que “las instalaciones recreativas componen un segmento significativo de los proyectos de reconstrucción y tienen un efecto positivo tanto para el pequeño como mediano comerciante. Estas instalaciones también añaden valor a la oferta turística que se enriquece por la diversidad de las atracciones que van desde actividades en la costa hasta la montaña”. Hasta el momento, existen 1,095 proyectos en construcción en instalaciones recreativas y deportivas alrededor de la isla con un valor aproximado de $420.4 millones, informó Laboy.

    "title": "Venezuela to hold military exercises as British warship heads to Guyana | Shropshire Star",
    "text": "Nicolas Maduro described the impending arrival of HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a ‘threat’ to his country. President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "title": "The Haitian-American US attorney handling the Trump gunman case personifies the American Dream",
    "text": "Haitian-American immigrant Markenzy Lapointe, the Biden-appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, personifies the immigrant American Dream story. Just days after Trump spewed vile conspiracies about Haitian migrants during his debate debacle with Vice President Kamala Harris, Lapointe was thrust into the spotlight after taking charge of the prosecution of Ryan Routh, who is suspected of attempting to assassinate the former president at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Here is Lapointe describing the charges against Routh at a news conference on Monday. So far Routh has been charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person — convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He was ordered held in pre-trial detention as the FBI continues its investigation. i Trump has said that immigrants from Haiti and other countries are “poisoning the blood of our country.” Adolf Hitler used the term “blood poisoning” when he criticized immigration in his manifesto “Mein Kampf.” But if anyone is spreading poisonous venom in the country it is Trump and his MAGA cultists with their anti-immigrant hate speech. So it is quite ironic that the federal prosecutor handling the investigation into a suspected assassination attempt against Trump by a middle-aged white male is a Haitian-American who came to the U.S. as a teenager. Lapointe is not only the first Black lawyer to hold the position of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, but also the first Haitian-American ever to serve as a U.S. Attorney in any of the 94 federal districts. And his appointment wouldn’t have been possible without President Joe Biden’s commitment to diversify the federal judiciary, not only by his nominations of federal judges but also by ensuring that U.S. attorneys come from diverse backgrounds, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In his first year in office, Biden nominated 37 people to the office of U.S. Attorney around the country, 20 of whom were Black and 13 were women. By contrast, over 85% of Trump’s appointments to the office of U.S. Attorney were white males, even though white men constitute less than 1/3 of the nation’s population, according to the Hispanic National Bar Association. Biden appointed Lapointe to the post of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida in September 2022. After his December 2022 Senate confirmation by a bipartisan voice vote, Lapointe took up the post as the top federal prosecutor for Southern Florida in January 2023. “One of the things you realize being the first of anything, first Haitian-American, first Black U.S. attorney, is there's a tremendous responsibility that comes with that. Part of that is recognizing it means a whole lot more than you thought it would because there’s an entire community who may have felt outside of the process, outside of the mix,” Lapointe told South Florida’s NBC 6 in February 2023. “And now they see you and they feel, ‘Oh. Finally now there's somebody who's from my neck of the woods who is there.’” “One of the things you realize being the first of anything, first Haitian-American, first Black U.S. attorney, is there's a tremendous responsibility that comes with that. Part of that is recognizing it means a whole lot more than you thought it would because there’s an entire community who may have felt outside of the process, outside of the mix,” Lapointe told South Florida’s NBC 6 in February 2023. “And now they see you and they feel, ‘Oh. Finally now there's somebody who's from my neck of the woods who is there.’” Just consider the obstacles and hardships Lapointe had to overcome to reach his position. NBC 6 wrote: He uses words like “surreal” and “suspended reality,” but most often \"blessed\" when reflecting on his journey from a 16-year-old Haitian kid who did not know English sharing a two-bedroom Liberty City apartment with a single mom and four siblings to the top of federal law enforcement in South Florida. He uses words like “surreal” and “suspended reality,” but most often \"blessed\" when reflecting on his journey from a 16-year-old Haitian kid who did not know English sharing a two-bedroom Liberty City apartment with a single mom and four siblings to the top of federal law enforcement in South Florida. And he told the television station that he considers his mother to be his “superhero.” “For somebody who did not have an education, she clearly understood being part of this required her to work, required her to take care of her children on her own, making about $16,000 a year,” he recalled. “So to this day, I think she’s not just my hero, my superhero.” “For somebody who did not have an education, she clearly understood being part of this required her to work, required her to take care of her children on her own, making about $16,000 a year,” he recalled. “So to this day, I think she’s not just my hero, my superhero.” The Miami Herald wrote this about Lapointe’s background after Biden announced his appointment in 2022: He grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where his mother worked as a street vendor and his father as a tailor. He came to Miami as a 16-year-old to live with his mother and other siblings in Liberty City, during the racially turbulent 1980s. His mom worked as a cleaning lady at Stefano’s restaurant on upscale Key Biscayne, but his dad was absent from the home. The temptation of the drug trade was right outside his front door. “A lot of folks around me made those choices, but they were never mine,” said Lapointe, who worked as a cab driver and at a bar at the same Key Biscayne restaurant where his mom worked. He graduated from Miami Edison Senior High School in 1987, and joined the U.S. Marines as a reservist while attending Miami-Dade College for a couple of years. In 1990, he transferred to Florida State University. But Lapointe, still not a U.S. citizen at the time, had to put school on hold when he was called up as a reservist by the Marines after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War erupted. “I was there for six months,” said Lapointe, who missed his first year at FSU while serving a tour of duty in Iraq. “Going to war representing the United States was particularly meaningful to me,” Lapointe, who left the Marines as a corporal after serving six years as a reservist, told the Herald in an interview earlier this year. “It mattered to me as an immigrant who came here and could contribute to this country in a special way.” He grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where his mother worked as a street vendor and his father as a tailor.

Trump considers military service to be for “suckers” and “losers.” Lapointe graduated from Florida State University in 1993 with a B.S. degree in finance, and became a U.S. citizen two years later. In 1999, he graduated from FSU’s law school, and then worked as a law clerk for a Florida Supreme Court justice. He then joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami in 2002, where he remained until 2006. The Miami Herald wrote: In an Attorney at Law profile, Lapointe said that as a prosecutor he learned the critical importance of fairness in pursuing justice. “As a prosecutor, there is no better compliment than being fair because you have tremendous discretion and enormous power, and showing the appropriate responsibility in exercising that power is essential,” Lapointe said. In an Attorney at Law profile, Lapointe said that as a prosecutor he learned the critical importance of fairness in pursuing justice. “As a prosecutor, there is no better compliment than being fair because you have tremendous discretion and enormous power, and showing the appropriate responsibility in exercising that power is essential,” Lapointe said. He then became a successful attorney and partner at two prestigious law firms in Miami. He also was awarded for his pro bono work in the community, including a case in which he helped reunite an infant rescued from the rubble of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and flown to Miami for treatment with her parents. Thanks to his efforts, the family was allowed to remain in the United States. Nadeon Gedeon, president of the Haitian Lawyers Association, interviewed by the South Florida Times in December 2022, praised Lapointe for his service “through extensive pro bono legal work, mentorship and active community involvement.” \"A naturalized citizen himself, Mr. Lapointe passionately assists in legal clinics aimed at providing information and helping eligible persons complete applications for United States Citizenship and Temporary Protected Status. With a heart to help the youth in inner-cities, Mr. Lapointe … remains a constant voice and necessary presence in our community.” \"A naturalized citizen himself, Mr. Lapointe passionately assists in legal clinics aimed at providing information and helping eligible persons complete applications for United States Citizenship and Temporary Protected Status. With a heart to help the youth in inner-cities, Mr. Lapointe … remains a constant voice and necessary presence in our community.” Until the Trump case, the most prominent case he handled was against the alleged assassins of Haitian President Jovenel Moise in July 2021. It led to a grand jury indictment against 11 people and the arrest of four Florida residents allegedly involved in the scheme. In February 2024, Lapointe released this Public Service Announcement about how to report hate crimes. Lapointe said: “Hate crimes tear us apart. That’s why the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida alongside the FBI and all other law enforcement partners stand united to protect and serve every community. If you commit a hate crime, we will charge you federally and hold you accountable in a court of law. … Together we can build a world free of hate crimes.” “Hate crimes tear us apart. That’s why the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida alongside the FBI and all other law enforcement partners stand united to protect and serve every community. If you commit a hate crime, we will charge you federally and hold you accountable in a court of law. … Together we can build a world free of hate crimes.” Hint. If you want to build a world free of hate crimes, one place to start might be at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, which is under the jurisdiction of the Southern District of Florida, Lawrence O’Donnell in the opening of his MSNBC show on Monday night noted the historical twist that the federal prosecutor in charge of investigating a possible attempted assassination of Trump is an immigrant from Haiti. (O’Donnell’s remarks about Lapointe begin at the 6-minute mark) O’Donnell emphasized just how high the stakes are in the upcoming election for the American judicial system. “These are the days to remember that there’s one political party in America that wants to defund the police, and the police that they want to defund are FBI agents and other federal agents. … If Republican win the White House and if they win the U.S. Senate, they will replace Markenzy Lapointe and every Biden-appointed U.S. Attorney throughout the country with a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney. … “Republican control of the Senate would guarantee that Donald Trump could appoint anyone he wants to anything. At stake in the election and especially in the Senate election is the future of the American court system. Markenzy Lapointe is the first Haitian-American U.S. Attorney in U.S> history. There won’t be another one in a Trump administration.”",
