    "text": "Indian court seeks renaming Sita and Akbar lion pair amid religious furore Sita and Akbar were shipped to Siliguri zoo in West Bengal this month as part of an animal exchange programme from a neighbouring state, irking a prominent right-wing Hindu organisation that campaigns against interfaith relationships. An Indian court has asked authorities to find new monikers for two lions named after a Hindu goddess and a Muslim emperor, following a religious group's petition to stop them from sharing an enclosure. Sita and Akbar were shipped to Siliguri Zoo in West Bengal this month as part of an animal exchange programme from a neighbouring state. That irked the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a prominent right-wing Hindu organisation that has campaigned against interfaith relationships. The group took the matter to court saying the lion pair's cohabitation was an act of \"blasphemy\" that hurt Hindu religious sentiments. Justice Saugata Bhattacharyya of the Calcutta High Court asked government counsel to rename the pair on Thursday. \"These names should be avoided and discontinued to avoid unnecessary controversy,\" he said from the bench, according to the Hindustan Times newspaper. Government counsel Joyjit Choudhury told the judge that the state was \"already thinking of renaming\" the pair. Sita is one of the main characters of the Hindu epic Ramayana and the wife of Ram, one of the Hindu faith's most revered deities. Akbar was a 16th-century Mughal emperor who extended Islamic rule over much of the Indian subcontinent — a time Hindu nationalist groups say was a period that their religion was oppressed. The VHP also claimed that Akbar the lion had originally been named after Ram before the pair arrived in Siliguri. Critics say religious intolerance towards India's 200-million-strong Muslim minority has grown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government came to power in 2014. The VHP, a group loosely affiliated with Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has campaigned against interfaith marriages and supported efforts by state governments to make them more difficult. It has also promulgated a \"Love Jihad\" conspiracy theory that alleges India's Muslim minority hoodwinked Hindu women into marriage to convert them to Islam.",

That took deaths from hits overnight and on Thursday to 28 and over 600 since Monday.\nThe strike killed the head of one of Hezbollah's air force units, Mohammad Surur, Hezbollah said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations among the group's top ranks.\nIsrael said it has struck about 220 Hezbollah targets over the past day.\nOn the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon, the army staged an exercise simulating a ground invasion - a potential next stage after relentless airstrikes and explosions of communications devices.\nIsrael's air force is planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran, Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said late on Thursday.\n<div class='ads__container inline-story-add id ='v-indiatoday-in' > \"We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with Northern Command for a ground maneuver. Prepared, if activated. This is a decision to be made above us,\" he told soldiers, in a video distributed by the Israeli military.\nIsrael has vowed to secure its north and return thousands of citizens who have evacuated since Hezbollah launched a campaign of cross-border strikes last year in solidarity with Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza.\nLanding in the US to address the UN General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters the military will keep hitting Hezbollah with \"full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals, first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes.\"\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X, \"There will be no ceasefire in the north.\"\nIsrael's stance dashed hopes for a swift settlement after Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, whose government includes Hezbollah elements, had expressed hope for a ceasefire.\nWhite House spokesperson John Kirby told a briefing on Thursday that Israel had been \"fully informed and fully aware of every word\" in the ceasefire proposal and allies expected it would be taken seriously. The US is Israel's longtime ally and biggest arms supplier.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he did not believe Israel's rejection was definitive. \"It would be a mistake by the prime minister to refuse it because he would be taking responsibility for regional escalation,\" Macron told reporters in Canada.\n\"We will do everything to ensure this proposal is accepted,\" Macron said, adding that France was ready to call a new UN Security Council meeting to endorse the proposal.\nHundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes during the heaviest Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since a major war in 2006.\nHezbollah has faced off against the Israeli military since the Shi'ite Muslim movement was created by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to counter an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It has since evolved into Tehran's most powerful Middle East proxy. WASHINGTON STILL SEEKS CEASEFIRE\nThe White House said that US and Israeli officials, including US Mideast envoy Brett McGurk, were holding discussions on Thursday in New York.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to meet with Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer.\nIn London, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned there was a risk of all-out war in the Middle East, but a diplomatic solution was still possible.\nadvertisement \"So let me be clear, Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path, despite the sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable,\" Austin said.\nHezbollah has fired hundreds of missiles at targets in Israel, including its commercial hub Tel Aviv, although Israel's aerial defense system has ensured the damage has been limited.\nIsraeli fighter jets on Thursday also hit infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel's military said.\nThe Lebanese health ministry said most of the victims on Thursday were Syrians killed in the town of Younine in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanon is home to around 1.5 million Syrians who fled the civil war there.\nHezbollah said in a statement it had struck the town of Kiryat Shmona in north Israel and an Israeli military northern command base, as well as using air defence weapons to force two Israeli warplanes back.\nIn Beirut, thousands of Lebanese have sought shelter in schools. In one, women could be seen leaning out of classroom windows, smoking cigarettes or airing out foam mattresses they had slept on this week.\nAid organisations were distributing clothes and food, and checking on medication needed by elderly people who fled too quickly to bring prescriptions with them.\nPublished By: Sudeep Lavania Published On: Sep 27, 2024 Must Watch",

    "text": "Desesperación y miedo: Esaud Suárez denuncia extorsión y sufre insomnio. | Latina Esaud Suárez conocido cantante de cumbia e integrante de orquestas como Kaliente, Caribeños de Guadalupe y Papillón, realizó una grave denuncia pública, revelando que está siendo víctima de extorsión por parte de delincuentes trujillanos que le exigen el pago de 30 mil soles.\nLa situación ha generado un grave impacto en su vida personal y profesional, al punto que sufre de insomnio y se ha visto obligado a medicarse para poder descansar. El recordado intérprete de ‘Triste Payaso’, también reveló que ha tenido que poner en pausa sus presentaciones para evitar posibles atentados.\nCantante Esaud Suárez teme por su vida Esaud Suárez relató a una radio local que hace 20 días que no ha podido trabajar debido al temor por su seguridad y la de su familia. “Es muy preocupante para mí. No puedo dormir, estoy preocupado. No puedo viajar, quién me garantiza la seguridad para dar mis shows”, narró con gesto de preocupación.\n“Tengo que irme de aquí de Iquitos a la capital y moverme por todo el Perú para mis presentaciones; pero, así como estamos, no puedo viajar”, añadió en charla con RPP. El artista mencionó al medio de comunicación que ha recibido constantes llamadas y mensajes amenazantes, incluyendo audios que detallan planes para atentar contra su vivienda y el bus en el que se transporta. El programa Latina también mostró parte de las conversaciones que le enviaron los delincuentes.\nIntimidaron a sus hijas Con una creciente intensidad, los extorsionadores también han comenzado a enviar mensajes intimidatorios a sus hijas menores, exacerbando la angustia del intérprete de cumbia al involucrar a su familia en las amenazas.\n“Los delincuentes les han escrito a mis hijas menores de edad. Cada vez que voy a entrar a Trujillo me han mandado amenazas. Al principio era suave, pero ahora se han metido con mis hijas y estoy preocupado”, confesó Suárez, visiblemente afectado por el acoso constante y el peligro que esto representa. La situación se agravó aún más cuando recordó el reciente asesinato de un colega cumbiambero durante un concierto en vivo, lo que aumentó su preocupación por la seguridad en el ambiente musical. Debido a esto, decidió suspender todas sus presentaciones.\nPide ayuda a ministro del Interior El cantante se ha visto obligado a llevar su denuncia a la opinión pública, buscando llamar la atención de las autoridades para obtener protección adecuada. Durante su intervención en la radio local, suplicó al ministro del Interior para que tome cartas en el asunto y garantice su seguridad.\n“Esto no es broma, se trata de artistas, de peruanos, compatriotas, de padres, tome cartas en el asunto”, imploró Esaud Suárez. La cumbia bajo la amenaza de extorsionadores El cantante de cumbia Jaime Carmona fue asesinado el pasado lunes 10 mientras realizaba una presentación en una cebichería del distrito de Independencia, en Lima. El crimen quedó registrado en un video, ya que el intérprete estaba transmitiendo en vivo a través de la plataforma TikTok su actuación musical.\nLa Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) ha iniciado una investigación para esclarecer los hechos. Según las primeras informaciones, él estaba siendo extorsionado para que pagase una gran cantidad de dinero; de no hacerlo, no podría continuar cantando en Lima Norte.\nSin embargo, el entorno cercano al artista asegura que no tenían conocimiento de tales amenazas. Su hermano informó a varios medios que se enteró de los mensajes extorsivos a través de las autoridades.\nSus restos fueron velados en ‘El Huaralino’, un conocido local de eventos y espectáculos en Los Olivos. Amigos, familiares y colegas se congregaron en el lugar para despedirlo. Durante el sepelio, el administrador del establecimiento, Juan Pablo Fernández, lamentó que las extorsiones sean algo común para solistas y agrupaciones musicales, relatando que él mismo ha sido víctima de estos actos delictivos.",

    "title": "IDF combat unit recruitment attracts record number of Israeli men and women",
    "text": "Almost seven months into the war in Gaza, Israelis are flocking to combat units in the Israeli Defense Forces at higher than expected numbers. The IDF published data on April 30\nreflecting the percentage of recruits for various units in the army over the last two months. The data showed that men and women in Israel were seeking higher than expected recruitment to combat units, a choice which requires them to meet certain standards of fitness and complete other tests depending on the unit.\nThe women’s recruitment data for March and April was especially striking, showing that the artillery corps received 195% of the female recruits that it had sought. This would mean for every woman the corps expected to recruit, two were seeking the position. The IDF did not present precise numbers or reveal whether the corps would induct the additional women. Many combat units are not open to women in the IDF, even though more than 90% of units and roles in the IDF are open to women. Recent years have seen strides for women in combat, including a series of new border protection units that are coed as well as the first attempts to integrate women into tanks with all-female crews.\nWomen-led tank crews played a key role on October 7, driving tanks from an Egyptian border post to confront hundreds of terrorists on the Gaza border. Women in the artillery serve in various positions,\nincluding in the Sky Rider unit which uses Skylark drones to aid the 215th artillery brigade in targeting. In September 2023, the IDF also opened two commando units, the Yahalom combat engineers and 699 helicopter rescue unit, to female recruits to try out the intense training required.\nThe wave of women joining combat units began after the war started in October 2023. December 2023 recruitment data\nshowed units receiving more than 100% of the number of female recruits it had aimed for. The March and April data confirms the trend, illustrating how women are flocking to the combat units and combat adjacent units that are open to them.\nIn 2023, a total of\n62% of IDF recruits were men, reflecting the fact that women have more exemptions for army service. However, motivation to serve in combat units had declined among Israeli men before the war. In December 2022, only 66% of male recruits said they wanted to serve in combat roles. That trend appears to have been reversed due to the war. Among the units that saw the highest number of additional men seeking recruitment compared to what was expected were the combat engineers, artillery and the Nahal, Givati, Golani and Kfir infantry brigades. The armored corps also saw a 130% increase over its numbers from March 2023. The armored corps will need the additional men because it is currently expanding the number of regular army tank companies it has, adding a regular army company to each battalion in the coming years. The process has already begun with three new companies being trained. This won’t alter the number of tanks in the battalion, because in the past the battalions had two regular companies and a reserve company, meaning around 36 tanks per battalion. It will essentially mean the three regular armored brigades of the IDF, the 7th, 188th and 401st, will now have access to more regular army soldiers, rather than relying on reservists to fill out the ranks. The IDF has a number of reserve armored brigade units.\nOverall, the numbers show that almost every combat unit is receiving over 100% of the number of men it had been seeking and planned to receive, and the numbers among women joining are even higher. In January, Israeli media reported that the IDF was seeking an\nadditional 7,000 soldiers, apparently above the numbers it estimated it would recruit. This comes as the IDF has also suffered the loss of 608 soldiers with more than 3,000 wounded.",

    "text": "GP Baréin Carlos Sainz confirma las buenas sensaciones de Ferrari y espera una clasificación «apretada»\nCarlos Sainz ha completado un buen jueves con Ferrari. El piloto español ha afirmado que el equipo italiano está dónde esperaba en este inicio de temporada. Sainz cree que van a tener una clasificación igualada.\n4 19:25\nFerrari terminó los test de pretemporada con buenas sensaciones y parece que estas se han extendido al primer día de la temporada de 2024. En los primeros libres, no destacaron sus tiempos y, como la mayoría, se centraron más en hacer pruebas y recabar información.\nEn los segundos libres, Carlos Sainz terminó cuarto, por detrás de los dos Mercedes y Fernando Alonso. En esta sesión, tampoco tuvimos al equipo italiano centrándose en marcar tiempos. Pero, sus simulaciones de carrera fueron bastantes positivas.\nFerrari parece estar muy igualado con Mercedes, McLaren y Aston Martin. Además, en los stints de hoy de Sainz y Charles Leclerc, parece que los neumáticos se han comportado bien y que no tendrían los problemas de degradación que vienen arrastrando desde hace varias temporadas.\nSainz ha confirmado que las condiciones de la pista hoy hicieron que no pudieran ser tan consistentes en las dos sesiones. El español ha explicado que el equipo italiano está donde esperaba estar en este inicio de temporada.\n«Fue un día de entrenamientos más complicado en comparación con los test, con temperaturas más bajas y vientos más fuertes, lo que hizo más difícil ser consistente en la pista. Obviamente, no conocemos el plan de carrera de los demás, pero en términos de competitividad parece que estamos más o menos donde esperábamos estar», explica Sainz.\nTodo muy igualado\nEn el caso de Red Bull, todo indicada a que se estarían escondiendo. Ni Max Verstappen ni Checo Pérez han destacado por sus tiempos hoy. Sin embargo, en simulación de carrera, parece que Red Bull sigue por delante y que los equipos de detrás sí que se han comprimido más.\nSainz ha afirmado que espera una clasificación muy apretada mañana. En conjunto, el piloto de Ferrari confirma que han empezado con buen pie esta temporada de 2024 y que se va con buenas sensaciones de este jueves de entrenamientos libres.\n«Aparte de eso, creo que hemos tenido un buen jueves, completando todo nuestro programa y pruebas de neumáticos. Ahora toca analizar los datos y prepararse para la clasificación de mañana. ¡Lo espero con ansias, parece que va a estar apretado!», concluye Sainz.\nMañana viernes, debido a las modificaciones del calendario por el Ramadán, veremos si de verdad Ferrari ha conseguido dar un paso adelante durante el invierno. De momento, parece que podrán medirse con Mercedes. ¿Podrán superar a Red Bull? Habrá que esperar a las próximas sesiones para tener los primeros resultados representativos de esta temporada.\nFotos: Scuderia Ferrari",

    "text": "Éxodo en X: plataforma de Elon Musk pierde adeptos Tras las elecciones estadounidenses, periódicos como 'The Guardian' y 'La Vanguardia' dejaron de publicar en la red social. También usuarios particulares abandonan la plataforma. Los usuarios parecen estar abandonando una vez más la plataforma de redes sociales X, propiedad de Elon Musk, mientras otros sitios de microblogging se disparan a lo más alto de las clasificaciones de descargas de aplicaciones y cortejan a millones de nuevos usuarios en la semana transcurrida desde las elecciones estadounidenses. No está claro si los usuarios abandonan definitivamente X (antes Twitter) o simplemente abren nuevas cuentas en otros sitios. Pero tanto empresas como particulares mencionan como motivo de su salida el importante respaldo financiero y retórico de Musk a Donald Trump en las elecciones estadounidenses, así como la naturaleza polarizadora de la plataforma. No es la primera vez que X registra un descenso de usuarios activos. Lo hubo especialmente después de que Musk adquirió Twitter en octubre de 2022 y cuando Brasil prohibió la plataforma este año. Pero parece que el apoyo de Musk a Trump ha sido la gota que ha colmado el vaso para algunos usuarios. Otros factores \"Hasta cierto punto, se trata de un momento decisivo\", dijo a DW Bart Cammaerts, investigador sobre comunicación y democracia de la London School of Economics. Pero no cree que lo que ocurre obedezca solo a las elecciones. Cammaerts señala la reducción de la moderación y la retórica del propio Musk en torno a la futura dirección de X como factores que llevan tiempo cociéndose a fuego lento y que pueden haber inducido a los usuarios a alejarse. ¿Quiénes abandonan X? Este jueves 14 de noviembre, el periódico La Vanguardia se sumó a The Guardian, que en la víspera anunció que dejaría de publicar en X, aunque no suprimiría sus cuentas. No son los únicos que abandonan o reducen su presencia en X. Los medios de comunicación estadounidenses NPR y PBS dejaron de publicar en la plataforma el año pasado. La Australian Broadcasting Corporation también redujo sus decenas de ofertas en X a sólo cuatro. Más notables han sido las salidas de personajes famosos. Las actrices estadounidenses Jamie Lee Curtis y Bette Midler han eliminado sus cuentas en X, pero siguen presentes en otros sitios. Se suman así a Elton John, Jim Carrey, Whoopi Goldberg y Gigi Hadid, que abandonaron o dejaron de publicar tras la adquisición de Musk en 2022. En Alemania, también el Festival de Cine de Berlín y el equipo de la BundesligaFC St Pauli han anunciado su salida. ¿Por qué se van? Entre las razones citadas para abandonar la plataforma se cuenta el continuo aumento de contenidos negativos en la misma. En su declaración, The Guardian se refiere a \"contenido a menudo perturbador promovido o encontrado en la plataforma, incluyendo teorías de conspiración de extrema derecha y racismo\". Pero puede resultar difícil señalar una única causa de la salida. El periódico explicó que sus recursos podrían \"emplearse mejor\" en otra parte. \"Las empresas de noticias no tienen recursos ilimitados, las audiencias no tienen una atención ilimitada, por lo que podrían tener que tomar una decisión estratégica\", dijo a DW Silvia Majo-Vázquez, investigadora de comunicación política en la Universidad Libre de Ámsterdam. \"Otras plataformas están ganando atractivo, así que probablemente movilizarán sus recursos hacia aquellas plataformas que proporcionen nuevos [grupos] más difíciles de alcanzar -públicos jóvenes- y que quizá ofrezcan mejores entornos\". En cuanto a los particulares, muchos comentan que la \"sensación\" que ofrecen otras plataformas es como la del Twitter de antaño, con menos bots y más interacciones uno a uno. Es difícil predecir el rumbo futuro del discurso público en Internet, pero Cammaert cree que es una conversación que debe empezar ahora. \"¿Cómo queremos que sea nuestro entorno mediático democrático? ¿Y podemos, por medios democráticos, regularlo de tal manera que alcance ese ideal, más de lo que lo hace hoy? Ese también puede ser un debate polémico\".",
