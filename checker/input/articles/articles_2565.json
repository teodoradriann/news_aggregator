    "text": "BBC Police record rise in religious hate crimes after Israel-Gaza war Read full article Steve Swann & Emily Atkinson - BBC News 29 December 2023 at 2:44 am · 4-min read London’s Metropolitan Police force has already reported a rise in antisemitic incidents across the capital Antisemitic hate crimes rose sharply in the month after the Hamas attack on Israel, figures from some of the UK's largest police forces suggest.\nSome forces also recorded a rise in Islamophobic offences, though the picture is more mixed.\nThe Community Safety Trust, a Jewish charity, has called the figures \"shocking\".\nMeanwhile, campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse have described them as \"deeply worrying\".\nThe figures, obtained by PA news agency, show antisemitic offences rose significantly in the larger police force areas in the month following the 7 October attacks.\nGreater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic incidents compared with 15 during the same period the previous year, while the number of Islamophobic offences dropped to 34 from 43.\nMeanwhile, West Yorkshire Police recorded 53 antisemitic offences, up from 10 in 2022. Islamophobic offences rose to 49 from 29, it said - representing the biggest increase in such incidents.\nWest Midlands Police reported 22 antisemitic offences in the month to 7 November, compared with one in 2022, while Islamophobic offences fell to 25 from 33 in 2022.\nMerseyside Police said the number of antisemitic incidents had risen from four to 20. Islamophobic offences there rose from six to 10.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas showed a similar pattern in recorded antisemitic incidents, though with lower volumes of offences.\nHertfordshire Police recorded 17 antisemitic offences during the same in 2023, up from six in 2022, while Thames Valley Police saw its numbers rise from one to 21.\nThe greatest increase, however, was recorded by the British Transport Police - noting 87 antisemitic offences up from eight over the same period in 2022. Islamophobic offences jumped from from two to 22, it said.\nA spokesperson for the Community Security Trust said the figures made clear \"the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country\" since 7 October.\nStory continues They stressed it was essential for perpetrators to be identified and prosecuted, and that \"wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime\".\nIman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim abuse, described the levels of Islamophobic hatred and discrimination as \"deeply worrying\", adding it was affecting communities' \"trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging\".\nShe said: \"We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time.\"\n\"Please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish,\" she added. \"We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.\"\nPA received responses from 31 of the UK's 46 police forces to its Freedom of Information request.\nThe research does not include figures from London's Metropolitan Police, which has previously reported big surges in both antisemitic and Islamophobic offences.\nThe force said delays prevented it from supplying full data until the new year.\nThe Met previously recorded 188 arrests involving hate crime and acts of violence in the month to 7 November. A majority of the arrests were for suspected antisemitic offences and were linked to protests held in London, it said.\nThe Met Police last provided figures on arrests relating to hate crimes ahead of a day of mass protest in London in November At the time, the Met's commander for criminal justice Paul Trevers called the rise in religious hate crime in the capital \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\"No one should be subjected to hate because of their faith or race, and we are taking action against those who are offending,\" he said.\nSince police forces use different methods to record hate crimes, the data obtained by PA cannot be used to compare the number of offences across different areas.\nDue to the same reason, the figures cannot be used to provide a UK-wide total.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n\"We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n\"Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.\"\nThe unprecedented Hamas attacks on Israel killed 1,200 people. About 240 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 21,300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nTRENDING Lehrmann judge’s extraordinary court order NCA NewsWire · 3-min read Water bill shock after neighbour's dodgy act with couple on holiday Yahoo News Australia · 3-min read Two dead, five critical in horror crash NCA NewsWire · 4-min read ‘Sat on fat backsides’: Katter’s flood rant NCA NewsWire · 2-min read Aussie storm pictures that shocked the world NCA NewsWire · 2-min read",

    "text": "For years, patients and visitors at Melur Government Hospital in Madurai district have been plagued by repeated invasions by monkeys, turning hospital visits into nerve-wracking experiences. Despite multiple rescue operations and relocations, the monkey population continues to resurface, especially during late mornings.\nBelieved to have migrated from forest zones near Alagarkoil, these monkeys have now made the hospital blocks their daily haunt. “They swing between wards, rummage through garbage, and startle patients. They show up almost like clockwork between 10 am and noon,” said Vijayamohan, who was attending to a patient.\nSathyamoorthy, a regular visitor to the hospital’s maternal care centre, added, “They attempt to snatch our bags. It’s only when staff arrive with sticks that they flee. Even after being caught once, they come back. Now, they’re everywhere in the hospital.”\nHospital officials confirmed that while no attacks have occurred, fear among patients and staff is growing. Over ₹40,000 has been spent on cages, and several monkeys were relocated with forest department assistance. However, the issue resurfaces due to patients and attendants continuing to feed them.\nDistrict Forest Officer Tarun Kumar acknowledged the repeated rescues. “Relocated monkeys often return because people still feed them. We’re planning an awareness campaign and will address this in upcoming district-level meetings,” he said.\nOfficials now stress that public cooperation is essential to ending this monkey menace.",

    "title": "Domestic workers upskill for decent work",
    "text": "By Alois Vinga THE Domestic Workers Association in Zimbabwe (DWAZ) is pioneering efforts to equip domestic workers with skills, knowledge, and tools to enhance their opportunities to access decent employment work in the domestic and household sectors. Domestic workers in Zimbabwe, as in many parts of the world, are largely marginalized, work under highly informal conditions, and endure unfair labour conditions. Most of them are women and migrant workers. Domestic workers – are variously referred to by demeaning terms such as “garden boys” and “house girls” and are regarded as uneducated and underqualified workers who can be hired and fired at will. They are often invisible, denied their fundamental rights and lack social protection. According to Lusaba, founder of DWAZ, equipping domestic workers with skills is key to enabling domestic workers to gain the necessary skills that increase their employability and allow them to progress in their careers in the services and care work sectors. The Centre which was established in 2017 has members in Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. In 2020, DWAZ won the Innovation Challenge with a proposal to empower domestic workers with skills to improve their employability. In 2021, DWAZ set up and launched the Domestic Workers Training Centre to deliver accredited training packages to domestic workers. The Training Centre has developed a training curriculum offering training in housekeeping, cooking and baking, gardening and care work that has been accredited by the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development’s Higher Education Examinations Council (HEXCO). This accreditation will enable domestic workers to be trained, certified, and get better jobs. “We want to formalize and professionalize the industry of domestic work. It is one of the oldest professions but it is still not professionalized. Oftentimes the background of domestic workers is not matched with what they are expected to do. “It is a skills mismatch gap that needs to be filled through training to enable domestic workers to transition from the informal to the formal economy. We provide blended training including via WhatsApp,” said DWAZ. DWAZ said that there is a lot of child labour and human trafficking associated with domestic work that will need to be addressed through the training program and other interventions by the government, employers, and workers. The training modules will form the foundation for the domestic worker’s career advancement in care work, hospitality and tourism sectors.",

    "text": "WVU Medicine Wheeling and Reynolds Memorial hospitals made the generous donation after the June 14 wall of water swept through parts of the county, leading to water searches and rescues.\nWHEELING, W.Va. — An underwater drone was donated to the Ohio County EMA on Wednesday, marking the first of its kind in the region.\nThe state-of-the-art, $4,000 device will be able to move through water and ravaged areas.\nThe tethered drone extends to 300 feet under water -- and can be used in all counties if need be.\nOhio County EMA Director Lou Vargo says it will be on standby in all types of underwater emergencies.\n\"Anytime we have a drowning in the creek or looking for evidence for law enforcement,\" Vargo said. \"So, if we're helping the sheriff's department or law enforcement and we're looking for evidence, and they see a gun or a knife or something like that, the drone could actually go down and grab it.\nThe device will be administered by the county's swiftwater team, making it a gamechanger in search and rescue efforts for all involved.\n\"If we see something, it's better to send the drone if we can first, so we can do it safely to make an initial situational awareness. If we do see something that we need to send a rescuer in, then the commander would make that choice.\"\nWVU Medicine Wheeling and Reynolds Memorial hospitals made the generous donation after the June 14 wall of water swept through parts of the county, leading to days of water search and rescue.\n\"With the events over the last couple of weeks, obviously emergency management and our first responders have a very important job and all of us really work together, so we want to make sure that they have all of the equipment they need to be safe and keep the community safe,\" Director of Operations at Reynolds Memorial Hospital Chris Mercer said.\nOfficials are now actively seeking locations to begin drone training in local waterways.",

    "title": "Is this village near Mumbai an Islamic State 'liberated zone'? | Mumbai News - Times of India",
    "text": "Barely 60 kilometres from Mumbai lie the villages of Borivali and Padgha. Surrounded by the slopes of Mahuli Hills, this quaint locality in Bhiwandi taluka in Thane district has for long earned notoriety for being an alleged terror hotbed. And a recent crackdown by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took it a notch higher.In the early hours of December 9, the NIA busted a ‘terror network’ in Borivali-Padgha. The federal counter-terror agency arrested 15 people for their alleged links with the proscribed Islamic State (also known as Isis).The crackdown was part of simultaneous operations conducted in 44 locations across Maharashtra and neighbouring Karnataka.“NIA investigations have revealed that the accused, all members of Isis Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali, where they had hatched a conspiracy to spread terror and violence across India,” the agency said in a statement.“The arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone’. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence for strengthening the Padgha base,” the statement read.But this is not the first time that the village has seen such a crackdown. Almost two decades ago, some of its residents were accused of indulging in terrorist acts as well. medium106348945A blast from the pastFive residents of the Muslim-dominated village were convicted in the 2002-03 Mumbai serial blasts case. The key accused, Saquib Nachan, is one of the 15 people arrested during the December 9 raids. He has been named as the kingpin and head of the Islamic State module in Maharashtra. In August this year, Saquib’s son Shamil was arrested in connection with the Isis sleeper cell that was busted by the police in Pune.Saquib has been booked in over a dozen terror cases and convicted twice. In 1997, he was convicted by the Supreme Court for planning terror attacks in India, along with Khalistani terrorists. He was convicted again in 2016 by a Mumbai court under the Arms Act. He served both the sentences and was released in 2017. medium106349118A ‘liberated zone’ The Islamic State and its various offshoots are banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, or the UAPA. According to the US’ Director of National Intelligence, Islamic State is a Salafi-jihadist group that has conducted and inspired terrorist attacks worldwide, resulting in thousands killed or injured.Voice of Hind, a propaganda magazine suspected to be published by the Islamic State a few years ago, appealed to Indian Muslims to “wake up” and fight against the alleged oppression and atrocities meted out to the community.In its statement, the NIA claimed to have recovered a pistol, two air-guns, eight swords or knives, more than ₹68 lakh in cash, 51 Hamas flags, incriminating documents, smartphones and other digital devices, during the raids on December 9.The agency also said that the arrested men, who are in police custody, had self-declared the village of Padgha as a ‘liberated zone’ and as ‘Al Sham’ (an Arabic word used for Levant or greater Syria). They had allegedly motivated impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha for strengthening the Islamic State's base.The prime accused in the Padgha case, Saquib Nachan, used to administer a 'bayath' (oath of allegiance to the Khalifa of Islamic State) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation, the NIA claimed.Locals, however, deny any such attempts to declare Padgha as a “liberated territory” or asking Muslims to relocate to the area. “Most of the people in the village have been here for generations. We all know each other, people who have relocated are the ones who have found work in the nearby warehouses,” a local says speaking on condition of anonymity.He stresses that the Padgha gram panchayat and all other government offices in the area still retain their names, “Where is the question of declaring the village as ‘Al-Sham’?” he asked. 106351657Other side of the storyVillagers tell TOI+ that police and NIA are telling just one side of the story. They say Padgha finds mention in India’s history for its contribution to the freedom struggle. Village women had then stepped out of their houses during the Swadeshi movement and set afire British goods in Borivali. “That part of the history has been conveniently forgotten,” says another local. Families and friends of the arrested men says that none of them were involved in any illegal activities, let alone terrorism. They also express concerns over the manner in which the village was being linked to terrorist acts repeatedly.The villagers have now appointed a common lawyer to fight their case although it is not clear as to what charges the NIA has pressed against the 15 accused.“Padgha has been given a bad name because of one family, but that doesn’t mean the entire village has criminals. We have had instances of job letters being cancelled when the employer came to know that the person lives in Padgha. Many of our young boys are also struggling to find a match [for marriage]. Why should they be punished?” sayss Ravish Khot, a small-time realtor.“My son [26-year-old Yahya Khot] got married last year and his wife is expecting. Like in most houses of the village that were raided, nothing was found from our house too,” says Khot, who suffered a heart attack at the time of the raid and had to be rushed to a hospital in Bhiwandi. “Besides the men who have been arrested, the NIA officers are calling other people, as young as 14-15 year old, for questioning. Is that even fair?” asks Khot. Families cry foulSitting inside her partially dilapidated house, Rameeza Nachan (not related to Saquib Nachan) says she hasn't seen her two sons – Rafil (21) and Razil (22) since the day they were arrested by the NIA. “I was in Ajmer for a pilgrimage when the raids happened; both my boys were in the house at the time. Had I known this would happen, I would have never left them alone,” says Rameeza.“When I came home, the entire house was in a mess. I still don't know what the central agencies found in my house and arrested my children in such a serious case,” Rameeza wonders. 106349355Her two sons have been the only breadwinners for the family since her husband’s death five months ago. They used to drive a shared taxi on the Padgha-Bhiwandi route to feed the family. “We were waiting for Razil to finish his graduation so that he can look for a good job and earn better. But after this [the raid and arrest by NIA], we don't know what is in store for all of us. I don't even have money to pay for a lawyer,” she says. Claiming that her family has been living in Padgha for several decades now, Rameeza says the entire locality can vouch for the innocence of her family members. She has filed an application in the court, pleading that Razil be allowed to appear for his exam which he had missed due to his father’s death. Abubakar Kunnathpeedikal, father of another accused Munzir Kunnathpeedikal (37), says his son is a hardware engineer and runs his own internet and CCTV camera business. Munzir is married and has three children.“Officers started banging the door in the middle of the night. When I opened the door, they barged in and asked for Munzir. I woke him up and they said they had a search warrant. After searching the house, they took Munzir with them,\\\" says Abubakar. He shows TOI+ a document in which the officers had written that no item was seized from their house. “My son doesn’t even have an NC (non-cognisable offence) registered against him. Our family has nothing to do with the charges the police have levelled. In fact, Munzir worked on installing the internet line at the Padgha police station and the officers there knew him very well,” says Abubakar.",

O suspeito é marido de uma paciente da vítima e foi preso ao chegar no condomínio onde morava, em Natal, no Rio Grande do Norte.\nImagens de câmeras de segurança flagraram o momento em que ele foi surpreendido por policiais civis, ao entrar com o carro de luxo. Ele foi rendido e levado para a delegacia.\nA prisão só foi possível graças a imagens internas da casa da vítima e o depoimento de testemunhas, que fizeram com que em menos de 24 horas a polícia identificasse e prendesse o suspeito. O corpo de Fabiana Maia Veras foi encontrado amordaçado, amarrado e com marcas de cortes de arma branca dentro do próprio imóvel no interior do Rio Grande do Norte.\nNas câmeras o acusado aparece chegando na casa de Fabiana, usando capuz, máscara descartável para esconder o rosto e luvas nas mãos, além de uma sacola. Ele toca a campainha e a vítima atende, o cumprimenta e eles conversam. O homem entra no imóvel, usado também para atender pacientes. Eles conversam por um tempo até que caminham pelo imóvel e em seguida, somem das imagens ao entrar em um quarto. Em seguida, ele foge do local.\nO que a polícia busca confirmar é a relação entre suspeito e vítima. A principal linha de investigação é que a ex-companheira estava sendo atendida pela psicóloga, que teria dado conselhos para a mulher não retomar o relacionamento.\nVeja também\nPolícia conclui inquérito e pede pela 3ª vez prisão de motorista de Porsche\nMP pede novo teste para avaliar progressão de Nardoni para regime aberto\nVídeo: policial de folga flagra assalto, reage e dispara contra criminosos em SP Newsletter Notícias Inscreva-se na nossa newsletter e receba as notícias mais importantes do dia direto no seu e-mail.

    "text": "Татьяна ПономареваОпубликована сегодня в 6:55\nОпасность в каждом офисе: в воде из кулера нашли то, что точно не должно контактировать с человеком\nУчёные из Китая обнаружили опасные для здоровья фосфорорганические эфиры в воде из кулеров. Больше всего подобных веществ зафиксировано в горячей воде и жидкости комнатной температуры.\nТем не менее генеральный директор главного контрольно-испытательного центра питьевой воды, кандидат технических наук Юрий Гончар счёл эту информацию \"очередной страшилкой\".\n\"Это всё отравляющие вещества, которые убивают всё живое. Естественно, это не может использоваться при производстве всего, что контактирует с человеком. Фосфорорганические эфиры могут проникать через органы дыхания, через желудочно-кишечный тракт и даже через кожу. Поэтому ни в коем случае в быту это не может встречаться\", — объяснил специалист, подчеркивая недопустимость использования этих веществ в контакте с человеком.\nАгрессивный маркетинг: антиреклама бутилированной воды\nГончар дополнил, что указанные умозаключения являются агрессивным маркетинговым ходом против бутилированной воды, своего рода антиреклама кулеров.\nПо словам эксперта, все производители используют ионообменную смолу, чтобы убрать хлор, железо, тяжёлые металлы и активированный уголь. Специалист подчеркнул, что это необходимо для улучшения показателей питьевой жидкости.\nСамая большая опасность: необслуживаемая тара\nСамое опасное в кулерах — это необслуживаемая тара, в которой могут размножаться бактерии и микроорганизмы, загрязняющие воду. Поэтому важно регулярно чистить и дезинфицировать бутыли и сами кулеры.\nИнтересные факты о питьевой воде:\n- Человеку необходимо выпивать не менее 1,5-2 литров воды в день.\n- Качество питьевой воды влияет на здоровье и самочувствие.\n- Важно выбирать проверенных поставщиков питьевой воды и следить за чистотой оборудования.\nХотя информация об опасных фосфорорганических эфирах в воде из кулеров может быть преувеличением, важно помнить о необходимости следить за качеством питьевой воды и регулярно обслуживать кулеры, чтобы избежать размножения бактерий и микроорганизмов.\nПодписывайтесь на NewsInfo.Ru",
