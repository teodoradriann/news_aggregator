Its statement did not specify how it learned that she had died in the attack.\nThe couple’s bodies are being held by Hamas, according to the kibbutz, their family and the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. The groups said the couple were citizens of both Israel and the United States, and that Ms. Haggai also had Canadian citizenship.\nPresident Biden said he and Jill Biden, the first lady, were holding the couple’s “four children, seven grandchildren and other loved ones close to our hearts.”\n“I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me,” he said in a statement . “They have been living through hell for weeks.”\nMs. Haggai would be remembered “for the creative life she built with her husband,” her family said, adding that “their murders are a reminder for leaders everywhere to bring the hostages home now before it is too late.”\nThe post Israeli-American Thought to Be a Hostage Was Killed on Oct. 7, Her Family Says appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "However you intend to celebrate the start of 2024, the Met Office is predicting a miserable and rainy wash out weekend in Devon. There is little respite from Storm Gerrit, as meteorologists say more unsettled [weather](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/weather) is on its way, with a band of heavy rain is expected to move in from the south west. The Exeter-based forecaster has said rainfall in the UK has been above average during 2023, brought about by a wetter-than-usual autumn and it seems as though the start of 2024 will be more of the same. Scattered, heavy showers are set to sweep across Devon on December 31, with a heavy deluge arriving in Devon from 9am on January 1. While strong winds are still expected over the new year weekend, the Met Office says these won't be nearly as strong as those brought by Storm Gerrit, which is still playing havoc with the British weather. In the West Country, trees were brought down and some road bridges were closed, while a reported 'tornado' damaged around 100 homes in Greater Manchester amid 160mph winds. The heaviest rain will start to move in from Cornwall by around 12pm on January 1 and, according to Met Office weather maps, is unlikely to let up until the following day. While still breezy, wind speeds will be lower than seen recently, and are likely to drop further on January 1. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Temperatures across Devon are unlikely to reach more than 8-9C, and it will feel colder than is has during this [Christmas](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/christmas) Week. The Met Office says there is low confidence in the forecast heading into 2024. Nick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” Met Office South West forecast Today Another day of blustery showers, heavy at times, with some sunny spells. Staying rather mild and remaining breezy, especially in any heavy downpours though less windy than recent days. Maximum temperature 11 °C. Tonight Any day time showers gradually easing through the evening allowing for clearer skies for a time and lighter winds. Turning cloudier by dawn with some patchy rain from the west. Minimum temperature 4 °C. Saturday Turning unsettled with cloud and outbreaks of rain pushing in from the west. Rain turning heavy at times, especially later over the hills with strong gusty winds and coastal gales. Maximum temperature 12 °C. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday Often cloudy on Sunday with some blustery showers in the west. Largely fine on New Year's Day with a few showers. Cloudier on Tuesday with rain and stronger winds.",

    "title": "‘A tired old political stump tactic’: Republicans of color dismayed by Haley - POLITICO",
    "text": "Among other points of frustration is the sense that the GOP candidates still can’t seem to talk about the horrors of slavery. Republicans of color said on Thursday they were dismayed by Nikki Haley’s initial refusal to say that slavery was the cause of the Civil War. It wasn’t just an offensive historical omission, they argued, but a tactical blunder too. “She easily could’ve communicated better in that moment, but chose to use a tired old political stump tactic by tossing the same question back to the guy who asked,” said Rina Shah, a Republican strategist based in Washington, D.C., in a text to POLITICO. “What I do see is her having left out the word ‘slavery’ because she was scared to talk about anything regarding our nation’s complicated history. I think by acknowledging slavery she felt she might be alienating” Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis voters. Haley, who is currently running in second among GOP primary voters in both New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average , declined on Wednesday night to say slavery was the cause of America’s deadliest war. The next morning, she attempted to clarify her statement during an interview with The Pulse of NH . “I mean of course, the Civil War was about slavery,” said the former South Carolina governor. “We know that, that’s the easy part.” She also claimed that the questioner during the town hall was a “Democratic plant.” Black Republicans like Shermichael Singleton, who has worked on previous Republican presidential campaigns including Mitt Romney and Ben Carson, remained disenchanted. Singleton said he believed Haley was right that her questioner was a plant. But he didn’t think that was an excuse for fumbling the answer. “She should’ve been able to answer the damn question and move on,” he said. He added that her comments likely alienated moderate Republicans and swing voters she desperately needed to mount a successful challenge for the nomination. “She had a chance to be competitive even though she was always likely to lose [the nomination]. However, that’s over now. She’s toast,” Singleton said. Not all Republicans of color who spoke to POLITICO thought the moment would trip up Haley’s campaign. Though arguing that she could have been more nuanced in her answer, conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams called the episode a teachable moment. “There were so many other issues that caused the Civil War, whether it be states’ rights, the role of our federal government at the time, … the economy [Americans at that time] felt was in shambles,” Williams said. “But what she has to realize is all these issues, no matter what they were, were inextricably bound to the institution of slavery. She cannot separate slavery from any of these issues no matter how many she mentions.” But, Williams added, he didn’t think the episode would torpedo her campaign. “No, nor should it,” Williams said. “Listen, Nikki Haley is not a racist. She’s not a bigot. She’s a politician,” he said. “And sometimes politicians do what politicians do and they pay the price for it. And she’s paid the price for not being the person of courage and having the moral clarity to speak the truth.” For Republicans of color, the Haley maelstrom was frustrating in part because she’s not the first GOP candidate who has been tripped up by the issue of slavery. In August, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis found himself in the crosshairs of fellow Republicans of color after his state issued revised guidelines requiring teachers to instruct some school-age children that “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” Among others, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), took issue with the instructions, saying the personal benefit characterization was “wrong and needs to be adjusted.” The DeSantis camp dug in, saying Donalds, who is Black, was parroting talking points of Vice President Kamala Harris. It led to a slew of Black Republicans coming to Donalds’ defense and openly questioning the viability of the DeSantis campaign. DeSantis’ campaign was one of several that piled on Haley after her remarks, with the Florida governor calling her response “incomprehensible word salad.” Still, it is unclear how big an impact it will have with voters in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Some Republicans said a stumble like this, with just 18 days before the Iowa Caucus, is something Haley could ill afford. “Why Nikki Haley felt the need to sidestep a question that should’ve been a lay up is beyond me,” said Gen Z GOP activist CJ Pearson. He pointed to a common pushback by conservatives: that southern Democrats were defenders of the institution of slavery before splintering off from their party brethren. “We are the party of Lincoln, the party of abolition. We should stand on that, unapologetically and unequivocally,” said Pearson. And as for blunting her momentum, he added that the Haley camp had cause to be concerned. “I will say that a lot of independent voters who have rallied behind her probably woke up with a lot more pause this morning about her candidacy than they went to sleep with.”",

    "title": "Los cinco cócteles que serán tendencia para celebrar el Año Nuevo en Colombia",
    "text": "Faltan pocos días para que se acabe el 2024 y son varias las personas a las que les gusta despedir el año con unas buenas bebidas. Según cifras de Fenalco, el consumo de las bebidas alcohólicas el 31 de diciembre se incrementa hasta un 30 % frente a otros meses del año, sin contar el aumento en ventas de hasta un 20 % que registran los establecimientos de comercio en esta noche de rumba.\nCabe mencionar que la demanda de cócteles viene en aumento y estos se están posicionando como la bebida preferida de las personas. Muchos se están yendo por opciones como el mojito, el gin tonic o la margarita, por encima de otros tragos tradicionales como una cerveza o un shot de aguardiente o ron.\nTeniendo en cuenta esto, el Grupo La Movida, dueño del club nocturno La Movida en Cartagena, realizó un informe de cierre de año que revela cuáles son los cinco cocteles que serán tendencia para celebrar el Año Nuevo en Colombia.\nTambién: La destilería Laizhou: Líder en la producción de whisky y baijiu en Sichuan, China\nLos cócteles en tendencia\nCarlos Sierra, director creativo de Barra 7, otro de los bares operados por el Grupo La Movida y especialista en coctelería, destacó los cinco cocteles temáticos que serán tendencia en San Silvestre.\n1. Zuly: Se prepara a base de mezcal, coco, extracto de piña, zumo de limón, bitter (hierbas, flores, especias, frutas o raíces maceradas en alcohol que luego son infusionadas) y picante.\n2. Mangroove: Tiene un sabor frutal y picante, que combina el tradicional Margarita con el mango viche, la sal y el limón, sumando un toque especial de buen tequila, licor de naranja y tajín.\n3. Rola Plum: Se sirve en una copa coupé adornada con una espuma con aroma a cereza. Se hace con ciruela roja, mejor conocida en la costa como ciruela rola, vodka y polvo de flor de Jamaica.\n4. Mezcal Paloma: Con su sabor cítrico y ahumado, este año fue tendencia mundial. Cuenta con una mezcla de tequila, mezcal, licor de toronja, miel de agave, soda y sal de togarashi (combinación de chile, piel de mandarina, semillas de amapola, pimienta, ajonjolí, jengibre y nori o algas comestibles).\n5. Moscow Mule: Es picante y a la vez refrescante. Se prepara con vodka, jengibre, zumo de limón y soda.\nRecomendado: Este es el licor que prefieren consumir los colombianos para celebrar Navidad y año nuevo\nEl informe de fin de año de Grupo La Movida además indica que las tendencias en coctelería para 2025 serán: cócteles sostenibles, consumo consciente, uso de ingredientes saludables y bebidas listas para tomar que ya están preparadas y envasadas, a las que solo se necesita ponerles hielo.",
