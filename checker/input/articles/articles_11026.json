    "title": "Pedro Troglio fue presentado como nuevo técnico de Instituto de Córdoba",
    "text": "Instituto de Córdoba inauguró una nueva etapa con la presentación oficial de Pedro Troglio como su flamante director técnico. En una conferencia de prensa realizada en el bar Mi Barrio, ubicado en la sede del club, el entrenador expresó su entusiasmo por asumir este desafío en su regreso al fútbol argentino tras un exitoso ciclo en Olimpia de Honduras, donde conquistó nueve títulos.\nAcompañado por Claudio Caniggia, su representante, y en presencia del presidente Juan Manuel Cavagliatto y el manager Federico Bessone, Troglio aseguró estar listo para llevar a “La Gloria” a nuevos horizontes.\n“Estoy contento de estar acá. Fue todo muy rápido desde el llamado de Juan (Cavagliatto) y la visita de Fede (Bessone). Este club tiene ambición y ganas de progresar, y para mí es una gran oportunidad a mis 59 años. Espero no defraudar y llevar a Instituto al lugar donde merece estar”, declaró Troglio.\nSobre su visión de juego, adelantó: “Quiero un equipo intenso, que recupere rápido la pelota, sea protagonista y directo en sus acciones. Pero, sobre todo, que deje el alma en cada pelota”.\nEl técnico destacó el buen trabajo realizado por el equipo en la última temporada y aseguró que su intención es mantener la base del plantel, reforzarlo y consolidar la identidad del equipo: “Miré todo desde Honduras. La intención es mantener el plantel, evaluar a los que regresan, retener a los necesarios y reforzarnos en las posiciones que hagan falta para tener un plantel equilibrado”, comentó.\nPor su parte, Bessone señaló: “Estamos trabajando en renovaciones y scouting. Será un mercado corto, pero confiamos en cerrar nombres la semana próxima para arrancar bien la pretemporada”.\nTroglio comenzará los entrenamientos el 2 de enero y tendrá su debut oficial el 26 del mismo mes frente a Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, un rival especial por su fuerte vínculo afectivo con el club. Sobre el desafío, afirmó: “Lo importante es que los hinchas vean un equipo que los represente, que les genere sensaciones lindas. Mi criterio es consolidar lo bueno que se hizo este año y mejorar lo necesario”.\nAdemás, mencionó la relevancia de jugadores como Fernando Alarcón: “Es un referente y me encantaría que siga, pero a veces hay ofertas que no se pueden rechazar ni para el club ni para el jugador”.\nCon un contrato de un año, Pedro Troglio llega a Alta Córdoba con la misión de consolidar a Instituto en la Primera División y luchar por objetivos más ambiciosos, como la clasificación a una copa internacional. Su regreso al fútbol argentino genera expectativas entre los hinchas de “La Gloria”, quienes sueñan con un equipo que recupere su protagonismo y los represente dentro y fuera de la cancha.",

    "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Members of Kalamazoo Central's basketball teams kick-started the new year by giving back to the community. Outside in the cold rain Wednesday, freshman and junior varsity players handed out coffee and doughnuts to the homeless at three Kalamazoo parks. \"This is something that we chose to do this year,\" Kalamazoo Central Head Coach Ramsey Nichols said. \"We've done different community service events and this one here is just one where we give back to the community. We raise money every year through our Maroon Foundation and it's just something that we get together give back. Sometimes we just give it right out of our own pockets.\" Kalamazoo Central's teams had participated in community service events for the last 8-10 years. For 2024, Nichols' goal was to instill the value of giving back to the community within his players. \"I think it's a good experience for our kids to understand, you know, how people got where they are in life from certain circumstances and what not,\" Nichols said. \"You know, that's what we want them to gain from this experience.\" More information about Kalamazoo Central's Maroon Foundation can be found [online. ](https://www.kalamazoopublicschools.com/Page/2427)",

    "text": "Beyoncé's Intense 22-Day Vegan Diet Plan Once Sparked Controversy as it Baffled Her Fans and Doctors\nGrammy winner\nBeyoncé's 22-day vegan diet plan that allowed her to lose an insane 20 kilos baffled fans and doctors despite the stunning results, sparking controversy. The \"Cuff It\" singer wanted to shed some extra pounds post-birth of her twin babies and in an attempt to do so, she followed a strict all-vegan diet for a total of 22 days, reports Marca. At the beginning of the diet, she weighed roughly 100 pounds, which the singer didn't want to maintain so she devised a plan to get back into shape.\nDuring those days, she firmly refused to consume meat, eggs, dairy, bread, fish, and alcohol. 'I'm hungry!' said Beyonce after listing all the things she cannot eat. Her diet is completely plant-based and healthy, inclusive of multiple veggie-based recipes for every craving, sweet or savory. While the multiple Grammy award-winning singer is completely at peace with her journey of losing weight in that manner, doctors and nutritionists say otherwise. One such nutritionist, Daniel O'Shaughnessy entailed the dangers of this diet, as it only provides 1,400 calories to the consumer and emphasizes it as an abnormal portion to consume. Reports from Marca Lifestyle further advise against following the dietary plans of celebrities as it may not agree with everyone but instead with each individual's requirements.\nIn a\npost on Instagram, while promoting her collaboration with Park Trail, she flaunts her toned abs in a casual and chic blue ensemble featuring a blue crop top and blue cargo pants. She sported a wholesome smile along with minimalistic jewelry – a layered silver chain with a crucifix pendant along with big silver hoops that complimented her outfit's aesthetic perfectly.\nQueen Bey then surprised her fans with the announcement of her \"Renaissance\" World Tour in a post on Instagram in a sexy embezzled one-piece silver outfit studded with rhinestones and diamonds. Fans initially speculated about the return of the album or further parts of it since its release last year. However, the queen herself gave the fans more than what they asked for and surpassed expectations as she announced her tour. The last world tour the singer did was \"Formation,\" which earned her global success and $256 million in sales, according to reports.\nThis isn't the first time she's surprised her fans with news in the most extravagant manner possible. The\nannouncement of her pregnancy for her first child not only took fans by surprise but even her rapper husband Jay-Z was floored by the news. She certainly stole the show at the 2011 VMAs. Right before she began to perform \"Love On Top,\" the singer subtly hinted at the crowd to feel the love growing inside her. At the end of the performance, she dropped her mic, and unbuttoned her purple sequence coat with her baby bump in full view, earning cheers and roars of congratulations from fans and fellow associates of the industry.\n May 4, ",
