    "title": "Two priests arrested in Nicaragua after public prayer for the release of Bishop Rolando Alvarez - The Limited Times",
    "text": "Nicaraguan police arrested two more Catholic priests on Thursday, a source familiar with the case said. The new arrests bring to at least six the number of clerics imprisoned in the past week. The source, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of being arrested, said the two priests are being held for publicly praying for the release of Rolando Alvarez, bishop of the diocese of Matagalpa, who is highly critical of President Daniel Ortega and is also imprisoned.\nAccording to local media outlet Confidencial , they are Carlos Aviles, vicar general of Managua, and Hector Treminio , treasurer of the same diocese. In a homily in 2020, he reportedly criticized the Ortega family's enrichment, accusing them of being \" the biggest capitalists (in) the country .\" \" Aren't they the ones who were supposed to take care of the poor, and now they drive around in $240,000 cars? Where is the slogan for the poor?\" he claimed at the time.\nTheir arrest would bring to at least six the number of priests detained in the past week, two of whom have already been released, the media outlet said. Contacted by Reuters , the government's press office did not immediately respond.\nThe Catholic Church Targeted In recent years, the government of Daniel Ortega, who was re-elected in November 2021 for a fourth consecutive term, has targeted members of the Catholic Church. A few days before Christmas, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the diocese of Siuna, the second bishop to be detained after Bishop Alvarez.\nRolando Alvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, who had sharply criticized the government's deadly response to the 2018 mass protests demanding Ortega's departure, has been in captivity for more than 500 days. He was convicted of treason in early 2023 and sentenced to 26 years in prison.\nAccording to local media, many of the recently detained clerics were arrested for publicly praying for Bishop Alvarez's release. Nicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019, called for the priests to be released. \" I ask God to protect them and that they be released immediately!\" he posted on December 28 on X .",

    "text": "You know he cares about you, but something seems to hold him back.\nHe's sending mixed signals that confuse you: the smiles, sweet texts, and thoughtful little gifts – but then he shies away when things get more serious.\nWhat gives?\nThe truth is, he may love you but still have fears about relationships.\nDon't assume it's something lacking in you; his hesitation likely stems from his own issues with vulnerability or past romantic struggles.\nThe good news is that subtle signs can reveal his true feelings if you know what to look for.\n[show](#)] 17 Signs a Man Loves You But Is Afraid 1.

How to Handle It When You See the Signs He Is Into You But Afraid? Is He Scared of Me or Not Interested?\n17 Signs a Man Loves You But Is Afraid\nThese subtle signs show that he has strong feelings for you but is scared, revealing the clues your heart already senses – he truly cares, yet fears risking it or getting deeper emotionally.\nKeep reading to discover the top 17 ways to tell if the man in your life adores you but\nhas relationship jitters.\n1. He opens up to you about personal things.\nIf a man feels comfortable being vulnerable and sharing secrets, worries, or painful memories from his past, it signals he trusts you and sees you as a safe space. When someone typically guarded starts confiding in you about intensely private matters, it indicates care and emotional connection, even if he shies from commitment.\n2. He gets nervous when talking about the future.\nHave your conversations ever stalled when you try discussing future plans or dreams? Does he squirrel his way out of the talk and change the subject? If so, this evasiveness stems from fear, not disinterest. He loves sharing today with you yet panics about promises for tomorrow.\n3. He pulls away after getting very close.\nHave you noticed a pattern where, after a wonderful, close period of bonding and intimacy, he distances himself a bit emotionally? This rubber band effect happens when intimacy causes him to feel too vulnerable. He cares deeply but feels scared of the intensity, so he recoils.\n4. You notice his anxious ticks around you.\nPay attention to physical signals that indicate comforting you makes him anxious. These include fidgeting, sweating, stuttering, throat clearing, or blushing when expressing affection or chatting about the relationship. These signs reveal he's flustered by how much he likes you.\n5. He sends mixed messages about plans.\nDoes he mention wanting to visit your hometown, then claim he hates to make plans? Does he suggest a vacation together, then later say he prefers traveling solo? These mixed messages signal he envisions you in his future but doesn't know how to integrate you into it.\n6. He gets jealous but won't commit.\nIf he asks targeted questions about other men in your life or sulks when you spend less time together,\nit's jealousy. He wants to be your priority but also wants to avoid the responsibility of a relationship. His possessive actions without commitment reveal he cares deeply but has commitment phobias.\n7. He makes an effort to be close to you physically.\nNotice if he goes out of his way to sit near you, give long hugs, subtly touch your arm during conversations, or snuggle a bit closer on the couch. These affectionate gestures that gradually increase contact show he really likes you but finds verbal expressions of feelings difficult.\n8. He shares his dreams but not his problems.\nHave your deep talks revolved around hopes, goals, or lighthearted stories rather than problems? Sharing dreams requires trust and emotional bonding, so his willingness shows you matter. But by avoiding gloomy topics, he deflects anything “too real” that might propel the relationship forward faster.\n9. His friends know about you but not his family.\nIf his friends are familiar with details about you while his family remains strangers, it reveals he cares tremendously but isn't ready for you to enter his world fully. Introducing partners to friends is easy; integrating them with family signals a deep attachment he's not ready to acknowledge.\n10. He puts his guard down only while drinking.\nDoes he profess adoration or say he misses you only when he has liquid courage flowing? If sober conversations focus on surface-level fun but after a few drinks, he gets emotionally expressive, the alcohol is reducing inhibitions. He temporarily feels safe to say how much you truly mean to him.\n11. He gets scared after milestones.\nHave you noticed he pulls away or needs space for a bit after any significant relationship milestone – the first big argument, your first vacation together, exchanging “I love you,” or becoming intimate? These markers make the relationship more “real” for commitment-shy men.\n12. He gives you meaningful gifts but won't call you his girlfriend.\nWhen a man invests time into selecting gifts with significance just for you, like favorite candies from childhood or a piece of art resembling your personality, it signifies sincere care and attention. But if he balks at labels like “girlfriend,” he may have\nemotional availability issues.\n13. He talks problems out calmly with friends but stonewalls you.\nObserve how he handles disagreements with others compared to conflicts between the two of you. If he easily discusses problems with friends yet retreats emotionally or shuts down during your difficulties, he may fear being vulnerable regarding emotional intimacy.\n14. He remembers everything you say but forgets dates.\nTake note if he recalls tiny details about your life, interests, and stories yet somehow forgets plans you've scheduled together or mixes up important dates like your birthday. This dichotomy signals you've made a huge emotional impression, but he's scared of planning ahead.\n15. He hides his phone around you.\nHiding his phone when you enter a room, tilting the screen away from your view, or taking calls in private hints that closeness makes him squirrelly. He cares immensely but worries about losing independence within a committed relationship.\n16. He confides his inner world to you.\nIt takes tremendous trust for a man to unveil his secret dreams, spiritual beliefs, childhood traumas, or quiet quirks. If he chooses you as the guardian of his most vulnerable self, it reveals powerful caring despite lingering commitment issues.\n17. His actions don't match his words after a certain point.\nIn the initial stages, does he shower you with texts, compliments, and lavish dates? Then suddenly, as things progress, you feel emotionally distant as his affectionate words and deeds slowly taper off. This inconsistency exposes his fear of losing himself the deeper he dives into commitment.\nWhy Would a Guy Be Scared to Fall in Love with You?\nDuring those mystifying moments when your guy leaves you scratching your head about why he's resisting your oh-so-splendid partnership, it’s often nothing personal. In fact, he may have deep, squishy feelings bursting inside. Still, these terrifying ties to love trigger profound fears about vulnerability that breed evasiveness. Check out these root causes for his dread below the surface:\nHe feels unworthy.\nShame about past relationship failures or old emotional wounds can create heavy guilt. Deep down, he believes you're amazingly out of his league, so he self-sabotages intimacy before risking rejection or disappointment.\nHe fears losing his independence.\nMen commonly cherish autonomy. Accustomed to solo routines or space to pursue interests without compromise, they see “locking down” as noose-tightening. Though he desires intimacy, sacrificing freedom seems terrifying.\nCommitment equals trapped to him.\nIf he's dealt with messy breakups or watched his parents' marriage implode, it probably left some scars. To him, relationships just mean feeling trapped and suffocated. Even though the guy totally digs you and feels the chemistry heating up, taking that next step freaks him out big time.\nHe's paralyzed by rumination.\nIf he tends to overanalyze everything, his brain gets overwhelmed with doomsday “What if?” thoughts all the time. He might be totally blissed out about how awesome you are right now, but in the back of his head, he assumes this too-good-to-be-true phase won't last. His fear tells him sooner or later, feelings will fizzle, and boredom will kick in.\nIntimacy feels awkward to him.\nSome men lack maturity, positive role models, or experience navigating vulnerability. Expressing emotion stresses them out. Though the inner teenager may shout, “She's the one!” outwardly, he squirms when discussing anything too real, sweet, or romantic.\nHow to Handle It When You See the Signs He Is Into You But Afraid?\nWhen you start recognizing that internal war is raging inside him – intense attraction, battling equally intense fear – it leaves you puzzled and anxious. You see he cares for and enjoys you, yet something is blocking him from fully diving in emotionally. Before you panic, take a deep breath. With some insight into commitment phobia, you can handle his fears compassionately in ways that give the relationship room to grow:\n- Don't take it personally or blame yourself. His resistance likely ties to past pain or ingrained beliefs rather than flaws he perceives in you or the partnership.\n- Give him space if he seems overwhelmed. Don't chase or smother him, as that will heighten anxiety. Show you represent comfort, not demands.\n- Build trust and foster intimacy slowly versus expecting premature declarations of commitment status or the future.\n- Communicate your desire for his happiness, with or without you. Remove implied pressure.\n- If needed, suggest counseling to unlock avoidance patterns and build communication tools. Seek support yourself, too.\nAs you focus on yourself rather than changing him, either he will organically become capable of intimacy, or you'll realize you deserve someone fully available without reservations. Either way leads to self-understanding and peace.\nIs He Scared of Me or Not Interested?\nSometimes, it's tricky to decipher if his distance stems from emotional unavailability or plain old disinterest. But some signs point to waning attraction versus temporary walls triggered by intimacy fears. Notice these cues that signal he's moving on, not just going through a fearful phase:\nHe stops initiating contact.\nIf effort feels one-sided and your texts sit unanswered for days, it may mean you're no longer on his priority list. If he’s serious about you, he will respond promptly. But silence signals more disinterest than mere distancing.\nHe dodges making plans.\nOccasional rain checks are expected. But when you try to make plans, does he keep responding with wishy-washy excuses and no offers for alternative days/times? If so, he likely doesn't see a future with you. He would suggest rescheduling if he was still interested rather than just leaving things vague.\nYour jokes, stories, and vulnerabilities are met with deaf ears.\nEveryone zones out sometimes. However, consistent disinterest and distraction when you open your heart hints he's checked out. Scared men may listen intensely but need breaks from heavy discussions.\nPassion and affection are non-existent.\nLacking verbal praise is one thing; lacking kisses, hand-holding, and snuggles is another. Men who are enamored yet wary of relationships still find physical intimacy natural. A sexless, non-tactile dynamic spells game over.\nHe wants sex with no emotional intimacy.\nOn the other hand, he might be happy to be physically intimate, but stonewalls when you try to get closer emotionally. It’s not just fear holding him back; he just doesn’t feel the deep connection that real love requires.\nNo emotions surface when problems arise.\nHe doesn’t show remorse, tension, or sadness when he lets you down, misses an important date, or hurts your feelings. Zero emotion means the relationship flame has likely fizzled.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf the man you care for displays signs rof powerful feelings yetintense fear, exercise compassion for him and yourself. Avoid pressure. If your efforts remain one-sided or he shows little motivation to work through barriers, you may have to walk away, even with a heavy heart. But if willingness exists underneath the walls, give intimacy room to blossom organically.",

    "title": "The 9 Grooming Products We're Excited About Right Now",
    "text": "The calendar might say February, but as I write this, the warm-ish weather tells another story. I’ve been hibernating for what feels like an eternity, through the frigid temperatures, snowy weather, and early sunsets—and it’s tempting to believe that we’ve made it through. But if I’ve learned anything from past years, it’s that this is fake out. Hibernation season is still very much in full gear, my friends.You know what always helps me get through the winter doldrums? Grooming. That probably won’t surprise you, since I’m a grooming editor and all, but a little self care in the depths of winter goes a long way to lighten my mood, improve my seasonal depression, and generally make me feel less gross and more like a real human. And while my hibernation grooming routine borders on the psychotic (lots of Everything Showers, baths, and head-to-toe moisturizing), it could mean something very different for you. Maybe you don’t want to spend an hour in a bathtub, but you do want to chill out with the help of the perfect scented candle. Perhaps you just want your sheets to smell great while you’re bed rotting on the weekend. Or maybe all it takes is for your eyes to look bright and alert to perk up on those dark mornings. Whatever your hibernation self-care looks like to you, I celebrate it. I’ve spent the last few dark months doing all the things and I’ve found some pretty great new products that are ideal for this time of year. So whether you want to exfoliate away your Seasonal Affective Disorder or you just want to take this time to (finally) get into retinol, these are the best products to check out right now. Exfoliating Body Duo This new body care brand was inspired by the ancient hammam rituals of the Middle East and, frankly, there is nothing I would rather be doing in the winter than spending every waking moment in a steamy hammam. Sadly, that’s not a reality my calendar or wallet will allow, which is why I fell in love with this at-home version. The brand’s full cleansing ritual is meant to mimic the steps of a hammam, but if we’re really going to get to the crux of it, it’s all about this exfoliating duo. Apply the pre-exfoliating foam to help start releasing dead skin cells and nourish and protect the skin once you get to step two: sliding on the exfoliating glove and scrubbing away. It’s made from plant fibers that are gentle enough to not wreck your skin’s microbiome (provided you don’t scrub too hard) and the combination leaves your skin feeling smooth and conditioned. Eye Defy I’ve been a fan of GoldfadenMD’s OG eye cream, Bright Eyes, for years, but this new one hits a different need in my routine. It’s creamier and more nourishing and is designed to target signs of aging like fine lines with an infusion of peptides that promote collagen production. It’s also deeply hydrating thanks to ingredients like squalane, hyaluronic acid, and meadowfoam seed oil, which is doubly welcome during the cold winter months when my skin feels extra dry. I’ve been using this at night and haven’t woken up with sagging skin or eye bags once. Temple des Mousses Refillable Candle Candles are a mainstay in my house no matter the season, but in winter they become even more important. I’m spending more time inside nesting up, which means home scent becomes paramount. I’ve enjoyed playing around with the new Les Mondes de Diptyque (\\\"The Worlds of Diptyque\\\") collection, the first refillable candles from the iconic French candle brand. They come in beautiful reusable glass vessels and once you’ve burned through, popping in a refill is easy as pie. I’ve cycled through all five scents and Temple des Mousses (\\\"Temple of Moss\\\") is by far my favorite—a meditative green scent that’s slightly woody, slightly earthy, and inspired by Japanese zen gardens. UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 I know I’m approaching broken record territory here, but yes, wearing daily sunscreen is important, even in winter and even if you’re not outside. Finding the perfect sunscreen is a year-round pursuit for me and I’ve been really impressed with this new one from EltaMD. It’s mineral based, but slightly tinted, so it doesn’t leave any sort of white cast on my skin. It’s also packed with antioxidants that also help further protect my skin against photoaging (that’s aging caused by sunlight). There’s also hyaluronic acid in the formula and I found that it’s hydrating enough that it can replace my moisturizer as long as I’m not too dry. Aqua Universalis Fabric Care Set Here’s some advice for anyone looking to seduce me: the way to my heart is fancy laundry detergent.There are plenty of good smelling options out there, but I’ve never used anything quite like this super insanely fancy detergent from Maison Francis Kurkdjian. Like the perfect summertime eau de toilette, notes of musks, white flowers, Italian lemon, and Calabrian bergamot create an airy, fresh vibe that’s subtle but unmistakable. The first time I washed my sheets in this stuff (and the accompanying fabric softener) I felt like I was going to sleep in a chic, sun-dappled hotel on the Amalfi coast. If that’s not the vibe you want in the depths of winter, I don’t know what is. My only gripe is that the bottles are small—so I have to save it only for the most special occasions. Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer For me, winter is all about finding the right moisturizer to keep my skin protected from the cold air outside while helping prevent it from drying out in the warm air inside (thanks radiators). I spend most of the season trying different combinations of creams, lotions, serums—you name it—and the moment I tried this one, I knew it was going to be a winner. It’s a rich cream, which for me means it works best as a night cream, and it’s packed with ceramides that help to strengthen the skin and prevent signs of aging. It’s also ultra-moisturizing, so I’ve never woken up looking like a raisin. If you choose to wear it during the day, there’s also something in it called Gransil Blur, which is supposed to have a blurring effect, kinda like a filter IRL. I haven’t seen much of that, but I’ve almost exclusively been wearing it at night, so who’s to say. With or without, it’s become my favorite winter moisturizer. Software Update Retinol Body Serum Regular readers of this column will know that I’m a huge fan of body retinol, so I was really excited to try this new one. It did not disappoint. The low concentration of retinol makes it safe to use on your body and while the serum itself is billed as an anti-aging product for below the neck, I found that I really use it to address things like dark spots and post-breakout hyperpigmentation (there’s also niacinamide in the formula to help with that). I use it on areas like my back where I’ve broken out before and after only a few uses, I could swear the dark spots were already lighter. Clean Retinol I had the pleasure of recently meeting Dr. Julius Few, a Chicago-based “holistic” plastic surgeon whose celebrity clients are kept under wraps but come to him for his minimalist approach to surgery in favor of combining it with other treatments like lasers and skincare. He’s brought that philosophy to his new brand and I’ve been impressed with the whole range, but especially the Clean Retinol. Combining a low concentration of retinol with antioxidants, peptides, and botanicals, this ultra-gentle retinol serum is perfect for sensitive skin and works to stimulate collagen production and reduce signs of aging. It’s basically the only thing I put on at night (besides night cream) and my skin has been loving it. Purifying Whipped Cleanser In the grand scheme of skincare, cleansers can get overlooked because they’re kind of boring and they get washed off your face pretty quick. I think that’s wrong! I’m a total freak for cleansers and really geek out when I find a good one. Consider me geeked with this new one, then, because it is pretty perfect. It’s thick, pillowy, and barely lathers, but still deep cleans your pores and leaves your face feeling super clean but not tight. It’s suitable for all skin types, but I find it feels best when my skin is a little dry because it’s creamy and nourishing. Basically, it’s the platonic ideal of a face cleanser and I keep reaching for it over and over.",

    "text": "GARY, Ind. (WISH) — A police officer in Gary fatally shot a man during an armed hostage situation, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Department in a Wednesday news release. At 9 p.m. Tuesday, Lake County deputies responded to an apartment in the 2200 block of Carolina Street to assist Gary Police Department officers with securing a perimeter around the building. An armed man inside the apartment had reportedly held at least two people hostage: A 35-year-old male relative and a 1-year-old boy. Shots were fired inside the apartment and the relative suffered a minor injury. The relative was able to run from the apartment and refused medical treatment at the scene. The suspect refused to leave the apartment and fired multiple rounds at police during the incident. The Gary Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team requested the use of a Lake County Sheriff’s Department specialized tactical armored vehicle in an attempt to safely position officers closer to the scene. The department deployed the armored unit with four SWAT officers. The Lake County Sheriff’s Department Drone team provided real-time aerial surveillance. A ramming tool on the armored unit was used to breach the back door to the apartment, removing it. SWAT officers deployed tear gas inside the apartment, but the suspect refused to come out. He was seen approaching the front door several times with a gun in one hand and the boy in the other. Sometime around 4:20 a.m. Wednesday, the suspect walked out of the back door toward his vehicle holding the boy and pointing a gun at police. At that time, a Gary officer opened fire and the suspect was wounded. The suspect was later pronounced dead. The boy was not harmed. Investigators identified the suspect as a 38-year-old man, but they did not immediately provide his name. Lake County Crime Scene Investigation collected evidence at the scene. The investigation of this incident is ongoing.",

    "text": "LAS VEGAS — Needing a sweep through the Pac-12 Tournament to become the NCAA Tournament team they were expected to be, USC had a clear motivational edge over Arizona on Thursday. Except in one area. Arizona has never lost back-to-back games under third-year coach Tommy Lloyd and the Wildcats weren’t about to end that trend Thursday, avenging a loss at USC on Saturday by smashing the Trojans 70-49 in a Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinal game at T-Mobile Arena. The win moved UA to 25-7 and into a Pac-12 semifinal game Friday at 5 p.m. against the winner of Thursday afternoon’s UCLA-Oregon game. Arizona shot 45.6% from the field, while holding USC to just 35.7% shooting and outrebounding the Trojans 44-30. KJ Lewis had 15 points off the bench to lead UA in scoring while Jaden Bradley added 12 in reserve, while Oumar Ballo had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Leading by 12 at halftime, Arizona first took a 20-point lead, 44-24, when KJ Lewis grabbed a rebound of Caleb Love’s missed shot and made a second-chance layup. But Bradley later starred in a sequence that gave UA a 54-32 lead and brought the T-Mobile “McKale” crowd to a roar. Bradley drove through the USC defense for a layup to make it a 52-32 lead and then, while guarding USC’s Isaiah Collier as he drove around USC center Joshua Morgan, lunged to tap the ball out of Morgan’s hands. The ball rolled to UA forward Pelle Larsson in the center of the lane and Larsson fired it back to Bradley as he led on a break, with Bradley then turning into an emphatic dunk that gave UA a 54-32 lead. USC called a timeout after the play, and the celebration began, with Lewis gesturing with his hands up toward the UA fans. Less than a minute after the timeout, USC standout guard Boogie Ellis fouled out, having scored just six points on 2-for-11 shooting and the Trojans were all but done at that point. USC cut UA’s lead to 60-43 with 3:42 left but Pelle Larsson hit a 3-pointer to put the Wildcats back ahead by 20 and didn't lose ground the rest of the way. Bogged down in a sloppy, defensive-minded game early, the Wildcats managed a 28-16 halftime lead. The Wildcats shot just 38.5% from the field but held USC to just 23.3%, while the Trojans made just 2 of 12 3-pointers. Sun Devils: What went wrong with ASU basketball, what does Bobby Hurley do next? Ballo led the Wildcats before halftime with seven points and seven rebounds. Committing six turnovers in the first 10 minutes of the game, Arizona couldn’t establish an early rhythm, with the game in a 10-10 tie after Boogie Ellis hit a 3-pointer with 12:49 left in the half. USC later pulled within 16-14 on a driving layup from Isaiah Collier before Arizona began gradually expanding its lead. The Wildcats went ahead 23-17 with 3:49 left when Larsson hit an unguarded 3-pointer on the break while Caleb Love later added a 3-pointer for the Wildcats' 12-point halftime advantage with 26 seconds left before halftime.",

He marcado goles, todo va bien “, destacó la estrella francesa en una rueda de prensa de la selección francesa previa al partido de la Liga de las Naciones que va a disputar este viernes frente a Italia en París.\nEl encuentro se disputará en el Parque de los Príncipes, la que fue su casa deportiva durante sus siete años en el París Saint Germain (PSG), ya que el Estadio de Francia está ocupado por los Juegos Paralímpicos.\nEl atacante estrella y capitán de Francia dijo que estaba encantado de volver a París y al estadio de su antiguo club, y aseguró que no le preocupa la acogida que pueda tener por parte de los aficionados.\nVolver al Parque de los Príncipes “ es algo especial. He pasado muchos años aquí “, señaló. “Sobre la acogida, no espero gran cosa, me da igual.

    "text": "4 Min Read Boeing Co. factory workers walked off the job for the first time in 16 years, crippling manufacturing across the planemaker’s Seattle commercial jet hub after members of its largest union rejected a contract offer and voted to strike. Members of the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers, which represents 33,000 Boeing employees across the US West Coast, voted overwhelmingly to strike on Thursday in Seattle, with 94.6% voting to reject the offer and 96% supporting a strike. They downed tools officially at midnight local time. While both parties have expressed a desire to get back to the bargaining table sooner rather than later, the move adds to the strain on Boeing. The company was already reeling from the fallout over quality lapses after a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024 that spurred investigations, a customer revolt and an executive shake-up. “This has been a long time coming, our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, said to a packed hall of union members and media. “Clearly there were aspects of this agreement that weren’t good enough.” By the time he’d finished speaking, the chants of “strike, strike” were deafening. Boeing builds 737 Max jetliners at its Renton factory on the outskirts of Seattle and makes 777 and 767 models at its Everett facility to the city’s north. Holden added that Boeing’s offer didn’t compensate for 16 years of stagnated wages, higher out-of-pocket health care costs and the relocation of thousands of union jobs. “There’s a lot at stake here for our members, so I am proud of them,” he said. “And we’re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can.” Boeing said in a statement that it remains “committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.” By striking, members ignored a plea for peace by new Boeing Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, who has vowed to reset labor relations. And they bucked the recommendation of their own union leaders that they accept terms that included a 25% guaranteed wage increase over four years. While that’s the largest such pay hike ever offered by the planemaker, workers had expected a far greater increase. They were also angered that the terms also eliminated an annual bonus. Boeing has been in a financially difficult situation since a Jan. 5 accident exposed deficiencies at its factories and forced the planemaker to reduce production. The company has been bleeding cash as a result, and its credit rating is hovering one step above speculative grade, putting the planemaker in a difficult position as it contends with a heavy debt load of $45 billion. The defeat at the hand of workers means that Boeing and IAM District 751 will need to head back to the negotiating table to try and find terms that satisfy members of a union with a long history of activism. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at TD Cowen, has estimated a 50-day walkout, in line with previous strikes, clipping between $3 billion and $3.5 billion from Boeing’s cash flow. Boeing workers will now start to man picket lines at about 30 company gates from California to Moses Lake, in eastern Washington. Because the union is claiming an unfair labor practices strike, a mediator will be assigned by the federal National Labor Relations Board, Holden said. Boeing said earlier its offer was the best it could put forward given its strained finances. Managers have been canvassing other workers this week to see if they have the skills to temporarily replace striking IAM members. In the lead up to the late-night decision, IAM members outside of Boeing’s Renton factory voiced their anger at the offer and described the frustration of seeing wages stagnate under a long-term deal struck in 2014 that also eliminated pensions. They’re also mad the company kept a provision that forces hourly workers to be on the job for six years before they reach the maximum pay categories. “I’m working stupid amounts of overtime just to get by,” said Zachary Haley, a 737 quality assurance inspector who’s been with Boeing for five years.
