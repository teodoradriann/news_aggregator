    "text": "Dopo i due argenti di Angela Procida (nuoto) e di Assunta Legnante (disco), arriva la terza medaglia alle Paralimpiadi di Parigi 2024 per la Campania. Mette al collo un bronzo pesante Rossana Pasquino (fioretto), la professoressa federiciana, che condivide la grande gioia in pedana con capitan Loredana Trigilia, Andrea Mogos e Bebè Vio sulla pedana del Grand Palais. Quartetto Italico. «E' stata una palestra di vita stare in questa squadra, le ragazze mi hanno insegnato tantissimo», racconta entusiasta la campionessa classe 1982. Lezione di vita e di sport. «Non mollare mai, non si recrimina niente e bisogna sempre lottare per vincere. Sempre. Così abbiamo fatto, spiega la plurititolata schermitrice. Percorso. Le ragazze hanno superato Hong Kong 45-33 nella finale per il testo posto. Ai quarti hanno superato gli Stati Uniti (45-16), fermate soltanto dalla Cina in semifinale (45-41). Auspicio. «Spero di mettere in campo questi insegnamenti nella gara individuale di spada domani», conclude fiduciosa Pasquino.",

    "text": "BARÇA FEMENÍ\nWolfsburg 1-4 Barça Femení: a thrashing to get closer to the Champions 'semis'\nPublished:19/03/2025 - 23:26h\nUpdated:19/03/2025 - 23:26h\nFC Barcelona Femení took a big step towards the 'semis' of the Champions with a resounding victory in Germany against Wolfsburg (1-4)\nThe UEFA Women's Champions League held its other two first-leg matches of the quarter-finals this Wednesday. FC Barcelona Femení visited the always challenging Wolfsburg, but Pere Romeu's team once again imposed themselves with authority in Germany (1-4) to pave their way to another European semi-final, a stage they have reached in the last six seasons.\nThe azulgranas took possession from the start, but the first quarter of an hour was quite even, with few chances in the areas. In the 25th minute, a cross from Aitana ended in a goal after a failed clearance by Dijkstra, who in her effort to prevent the pass from finding a recipient in a rival ended up sending the ball into her own net. Despite the blow, the locals managed to stay in the game until halftime.\nBarça sealed the match and the tie in the second half\nAfter the break, Wolfsburg pushed forward to seek the equalizer, a factor that the Catalans took advantage of to wreak havoc in the opponent's field. In the 50th minute, Irene Paredes took advantage of a shot from Mapi León that seemed to be going wide to extend the lead. Three minutes later, the sentence would come through Salma Paralluelo, thanks to Aitana's assist.\nWith the score at 0-3, the Germans made substitutions to try to stem the bleeding at the back, while Pere Romeu waited until the 70th minute to bring on Ingrid Engen and Fridolina Rolfö for Salma and Esmee Brugts. The culés took their foot off the gas and Wolfsburg took advantage to score thanks to a header from defender Janina Minge. Immediately after, Sydney Schertenleib came on for Alexia Putellas.\nWith only a couple of minutes on the field, the Swiss player scored the definitive 1-4 taking advantage of a recovery by Aitana, who passed the ball to Rolfö and she to Schertenleib to complete a great collective action. Towards the end, Vicky López and Marta Torrejón would come on for Jana and Aitana, already in stoppage time. The rematch will be next Thursday at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, at 18:45.\nBarça and Lyon, one step away from facing each other in the 'semis'\nThe Barça Femení is aiming for its fourth crown in the Women's Champions League and the third in a row. The Olympique Lyon, the tournament's top winner with 8 titles, won five consecutive editions between 2016 and 2020. This season, the final will be held at the José Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, on May 24. The French team will almost certainly face the culés in the 'semis', after the 0-2 obtained in the first leg against Bayern Munich.\n⚽First-leg matches of the Champions quarter-finals\n- Real Madrid 2-0 Arsenal, in Madrid.\n- Bayern Munich 0-2 Olympique Lyon, in Munich.\n- Wolfsburg 1-4 FC Barcelona, in Wolfsburg.\n- Manchester City 2-0 Chelsea, in Manchester.\n⚽Second-leg matches of the Champions quarter-finals\n- Olympique Lyon vs Bayern Munich, Wednesday, March 26 in Lyon (18:45 CEST).\n- Arsenal vs Real Madrid, Wednesday, March 26 in London (21:00 CEST).\n- FC Barcelona vs Wolfsburg, Thursday, March 27 in Barcelona (18:45 CEST).\n- Chelsea vs Manchester City, Thursday, March 27 in London (21:00 CEST).\n⚽Semifinals of the UEFA Women's Champions League\n- Madrid/Arsenal vs City/Chelsea (April 19-20 and 26-27).\n- Barça/Wolfsburg vs Bayern/Lyon (April 19-20 to 26-27).",

    "text": "India's Best Colleges 2024\nHow executive upskilling is fueling India’s leadership pipeline\nUpskilling is a mindset that empowers individuals and organisations to grow together, shaping stronger leadership and future-ready workplaces\nIn today’s fast-moving world, those who grow with change are the ones who stay ahead. Leadership today isn’t defined by how long someone has been in the system or what title they hold. It’s defined by how open they are to learning, adapting and helping others move forward.\nUpskilling is one of the most powerful ways professionals can unlock new opportunities. It builds confidence, sharpens thinking and deepens the sense of responsibility. It’s not just about career growth.\nThe best leaders are lifelong learners. They stay curious. They don’t wait for someone to push them. They actively seek new skills, perspectives and ideas. And when teams see their leaders learning, they feel inspired to grow as well. This kind of mindset builds a strong connection at work. It’s no longer just about ticking off tasks. It’s about growing together and creating a culture where people feel seen, heard and supported.\nUpskilling is for everyone, not just leaders\nIn today’s work culture, learning and development must be for everyone. It should not be seen as a one-time activity but as part of the system. In fact, upskilling should be included in every employee’s KRA and KPI. It should be measured, supported and recognised like any other key performance area.\nOrganisations also need to actively encourage a culture of continuous learning. When learning is championed from the top and made accessible across levels, it becomes a shared priority, not just a personal initiative.\nIt also needs to be sector agnostic. Every department, not just sales or tech, needs access to learning that aligns with the company’s vision. Whether it’s HR, marketing, finance or operations, every team has a role in shaping the future. And they deserve tools that help them grow with it.\nWhen companies make upskilling a regular practice, they send a clear message: growth is for all. Skills should evolve with changing business needs, and that evolution should happen at every level.\nIt reflects company ambition and builds stronger bonds\nUpskilling also says a lot about the direction in which a company is headed. A business that invests in its people is serious about long-term success. In many ways, upskilling reflects the growth rate of a company. It’s a one-time investment in each employee, but the returns are long-lasting. It improves retention, strengthens trust and creates stronger alignment between individual goals and business outcomes.\nBefore launching any upskilling programme, it’s important to begin with conversations. Understand employees' aspirations and help them see how their growth aligns with where the company is going. These discussions bring clarity and show that the organisation values its people, not just their performance.\nHowever, it’s important not to run generic courses just for the sake of having a programme in place. Every learning initiative should be purpose-driven and future-ready. When upskilling is planned with intention, the outcomes are more impactful for both the company and its people.\nStaying relevant means staying curious\nAs industries continue to evolve, staying relevant means staying open to learning. New technologies and shifting market dynamics are changing not just how businesses operate, but also how roles are defined. As marketing, operations and even customer service evolve through AI, automation and analytics, the nature of jobs is transforming too.\nPeople who invest in their development don’t just cope with change, they embrace it. They adapt faster and take on larger roles with confidence. This same thinking applies to leadership. Upskilling helps professionals move from simply managing tasks to leading with clarity and care. It strengthens decision-making, communication and problem-solving, all of which are critical in today’s unpredictable environment.\nIndia’s growth story is closely tied to the kind of leadership we nurture. We need professionals who are driven by values, grounded in ethics and ready to guide teams through change. This kind of leadership doesn’t come from titles. It comes from a commitment to learn and lead with purpose.\nWhen companies and employees grow together, the bond becomes stronger and more meaningful. That mutual investment lays the foundation for long-term success.\nThe future of work is not about standing still. It’s about moving forward with intention. Upskilling is the fuel that drives this journey. It’s not just a learning tool, it's a mindset. One that shapes careers, strengthens companies and supports India’s leadership pipeline for the future.\nThe author is the CEO, Jaro Education",

Credit: Josh Robenstone\nMcCulloch and administrator Mark Irving, KC , were appointed following revelations of corruption, intimidation and criminal infiltration in the CFMEU in the Building Bad series published by this masthead, The Australian Financial Review and 60 Minutes .\nMcCulloch, the founding general secretary of the left-wing National Tertiary Education Union, was expected to lead the effort to clean up the CFMEU’s Victorian branch.\nOn Friday morning, a spokeswoman for the administrator confirmed McCulloch’s departure but declined to answer further questions about the reasons for his resignation.\nSources, not authorised to speak publicly, said Irving had received informal information that he believed necessitated McCulloch’s immediate departure.\nGovernment sources familiar with the matter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said McCulloch had used inappropriate language to women in work contexts since his appointment.\nMcCulloch did not respond to numerous attempts to contact him on Friday. The allegation was made informally and was not investigated.\nMcCulloch was a Communist Party member in the 1980s, a trait that could have enhanced his credibility with militant CFMEU members, but he has held senior Labor and superannuation roles in the years since leaving the university union in 2018.\nAdvertisement As Irving grapples with what he called the “massive” task of assuming control of the union, the old leadership regime he replaced – which includes two now-ex senior officials contesting serious criminal charges – has scrambled to fill the void created by the transition to administration.\nEx-CFMEU bosses Setka , Darren Greenfield and Michael Ravbar are organising fighting funds and alliances with sympathetic unions, led by the Electrical Trades Union, to create a rearguard movement aimed at destabilising Irving’s administration.\nOn Thursday, several large unions resolved to organise a second day of protests next week.\nUnion members and delegates are getting regular text messages as part of a campaign by those opposed to the administration, portraying it as an attack on hard-fought wages and conditions.\nIrving, though, has stressed his intention is to keep fighting for wages and conditions while using his extensive powers to fight bribery and other forms of corruption that have become entrenched in pockets of this industry.\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Au lendemain de la victoire de Donald Trump et de son meilleur soutien, le propriétaire milliardaire du réseau social X Elon Musk, les concurrents du réseau social se frottent les mains. 1. Pourquoi parle-t-on de chute du réseau social X ? Les résultats économiques du réseau social ne sont pas au rendez-vous. Depuis le rachat de Twitter pour 44 milliards de dollars en 2022, le réseau social rebaptisé X est en pleine décote. Le géant de l’investissement Fidelity a révisé plusieurs fois à la baisse sa valeur : aujourd’hui estimé à [9,4 milliards de dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/09/30/elon-musks-x-is-now-worth-around-a-fifth-of-the-44-billion-he-paid-for-it-fidelity-says/). Le [cabinet Brand Finance ](https://brandfinance.com/press-releases/the-decline-of-x-musks-rebrand-wipes-billions-in-brand-value)estime que la valeur de la marque X est en chute libre : de 5,7 milliards en 2022 à 673 millions de dollars en 2024. X revendique de son côté 547 millions d’utilisateurs actifs. Selon plusieurs observateurs économiques, cette affirmation est fausse. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/303681/twitter-users-worldwide/) estime que le nombre d’utilisateurs est en baisse : 368 millions d’utilisateurs en 2022, 335 millions en 2024. Côté annonceurs, [la société Kantar](https://www.kantar.com/Company-News/More-marketers-to-pull-back-on-X-ad-spend-than-ever-before) affirme que seulement 4 % des annonceurs considèrent désormais X comme une plateforme sûre pour les marques. C’est peu par rapport à d’autres réseaux sociaux comme Youtube ou Instagram. 2. Un exode vers d’autres réseaux sociaux est-il en cours ? Bluesky a gagné plus d’un million d’utilisateurs en une semaine, 4,5 millions depuis l’intensification en septembre de la campagne présidentielle aux Etats-Unis. Même constat pour Threads détenu par le groupe Meta qui atteint les 275 millions d’utilisateurs, soit un gain de 100 millions d’utilisateurs en moins 6 mois. « Salut monde moins haineux », publie mardi sur Bluesky le milliardaire Mark Cuban, soutien de Kamala Harris. Côté média, le célèbre journal britannique [The Gardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk) et le journal espagnol [Le Vanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/) ont décidé de ne plus rien publier sur la plateforme X. « La campagne électorale présidentielle américaine n’a servi qu’à souligner ce que nous considérons depuis longtemps : X est une plateforme médiatique toxique et son propriétaire, Elon Musk, a pu utiliser son influence pour façonner le discours politique », publie le journal dans un communiqué. 3.

Quelques jours plus tard, il licencie 7 500 personnes dénigrant les besoins de modérations de certains contenus haineux ou sensibles. Il supprime certaines fonctions du réseau social, comme les badges de vérifications, désormais obtenables moyennant paiement. Le propriétaire de Tesla ne se cache pas d’utiliser la plateforme à ses fins personnels. En avril, l[’homme le plus riche du monde selon Forbes](https://www.forbes.fr/classements/classement-milliardaires-forbes-novembre-2024-qui-sont-les-dix-personnalites-les-plus-riches-au-monde/) remplace le logo de l’oiseau bleu par celui de sa cryptomonnaie,[ le Dogecoin](https://www.lunion.fr/id593961/article/2024-04-26/le-fabuleux-destin-de-kabosu-chienne-star-dinternet-et-embleme-du-dogecoin). Ces dernières semaines, il s’était montré très actif pour promouvoir la candidature de Donald Trump qui vient d’annoncer sa nomination au ministre. Une nomination qui en dit long. De multiples conflits d’intérêts sont d’ores et déjà pressentis. Reste à connaître les limites du « free speech » que promeut Musk à propos du réseau social non censuré, accusé de devenir une plateforme submergée par la violence, le porno, et les « fakenews ».
