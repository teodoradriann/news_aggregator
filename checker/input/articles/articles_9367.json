    "text": "MANILA, Philippines -- Coming off back-to-back defeats, the second of which was a horrendous loss, the Magnolia Hotshots needed a huge bounce-back win as the PBA Philippine Cup quarterfinals race ramps up.\nAgainst the hungry Terrafirma Dyip, who are on the verge of making the playoffs for the first time since 2016, the Hotshots turned to 46-year-old Rafi Reavis for a much-needed boost.\nReavis, who has been in the league for 22 years, went back in time and delivered a crucial double-double of 10 points and 13 rebounds to help the Hotshots secure a 108-100 win over the Dyip Friday.\nThis is his first double-double performance since October 2020, when he had 12 points and 10 rebounds against the Phoenix Fuel Masters.\nThe big man said that more than the scoring output and numbers, he is just happy to contribute to the team’s victory.\n“I just got lucky, really. If I’m open in some spots, then I’ll try to make the best of that, just take advantage of what I can see in that time,” he told reporters after the game.\n“But if you’ve been following me over the years, you know I don’t care about points. [If] one of my teammates score, we all score. So, I’m just trying to play with a sense of urgency, and be a leader for my team on and off the court,” he added.\nOn Friday, Reavis made all five of his shots, scoring all 10 of his markers in the second half.\nHe also recorded a steal in 26 minutes of action.\n“Not really. Because again, I don’t really care about [being the] best player or points. I care about wins, championships… I’m just glad we won,” Reavis said.\nMagnolia head coach Chito Victolero also lauded the veteran’s play, saying just how important his contribution is, on and off the court.\nThe Hotshots will be ending their elimination round play against the TNT Tropang Giga on Sunday, May 5, at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in Manila.",

    "text": "OAN Staff [Blake Wolf](https://www.oann.com/tag/blake-wolf) 1:34 PM – Thursday, August 15, 2024 An 11-year-old boy has been arrested along with a 17-year-old boy following a series of violent subway mugging in Queens, New York. A number of robberies in NYC’s Central Park have been linked to a group of juvenile illegal migrants. Officials believe that the violent Venezuelan street gang, Tren de Aragua, holds responsibility for recruiting and orchestrating the boys’ criminal behavior. The two boys were arrested following a recent attack and mugging on a train headed for Manhattan on Tuesday night. “When I fought back to try and get my phone, they attacked. They jumped me,” the victim stated. “It’s pretty upsetting since he’s 11 and out on the subway doing this stuff.” Additionally, The victim, who requested that his name not be published in the press, claims that the 11-year-old was the “primary aggressor,” and “was essentially provoking it.” The boys were soon arrested that same night near a taxpayer-funded migrant shelter in Midtown Manhattan, as police had tracked the stolen phone to that location and found it in their possession. “The 11-year-old boy has stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel migrant shelter with his mother and three siblings since last year, said Kataleya, 44, a fellow Venezuelan asylum seeker at the hotel who spoke with The Post Thursday,” New York Post reported. Law enforcement officials also claim to have video footage of the 11-year-old boy using stolen credit cards. “At this point in time, we’re ready to call it: This is a migrant robbery pattern,” stated NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell. The 11-year-old was later released to an unidentified guardian, while the 17-year-old was taken into custody as a juvenile, police stated. “This is a product of a government with no plan on how to properly integrate these immigrants into our society,” said a NYPD supervisor.

    "text": "Read full article Fox News Israel forced to work on Jewish Sabbath as UN court judge calls out colleagues in scathing dissent Bradford Betz May 25, 2024 at 11:27 PM · 3 min read 703 Link Copied Israel forced to work on Jewish Sabbath as UN court judge calls out colleagues in scathing dissent\nOops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nA U.N. International Court of Justice (ICJ) chided her colleagues on Friday for requiring Israel to work on the Sabbath when responding to a case brought by South Africa to the ICJ under the Genocide Convention.\nThe dissenting opinion from ICJ Vice President Julia Sebutinde came in a nine-page document, issued in response to the court's order for Israel to end its military offensive in the southern city of Rafah in Gaza. That ruling stems from South Africa's request, which accuses Israel of genocide in its ongoing war with Hamas terrorists in Gaza. Israel has vehemently denied these charges.\nAmong her disagreements with her colleagues, Sebutinde, who is Ugandan, objected to the court's handling of South Africa's request, and the \"incidental oral hearings.\"\nJudge Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), speaks next to Judge Julia Sebutinde, vice president of the ICJ, at the start of a hearing in The Hague Netherlands, on May 16.\n\"In my view, the Court should have consented to Israel's request to postpone the oral hearings to the following week to allow for Israel to have sufficient time to fully respond to South Africa's Request and engage counsel,\" Sebutinde wrote, noting that the Israel's preferred Counsel was not available on the dates scheduled by the Court.\n\"It is also regrettable that Israel was required to respond to a question posed by a Member of the Court over the Jewish Sabbath,\" Sebutinde said. \"The Court's decision in this respect bear upon the procedural equality between the Parties and the good administration of justice by the Court.\"\nSebutinde also argued that the court’s initial ruling \"does not entirely prohibit the Israeli military from operating in Rafah.\" She also urged the court, to maintain its judicial integrity, to \"avoid reacting to every shift in the conflict and refrain from micromanaging the hostilities in the Gaza Strip, including Rafah.\"\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nLINDSEY GRAHAM TELLS UN INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE TO ‘GO TO HELL' OVER RULING AGAINST ISRAEL\nSebutinde clarified that the ruling operates to \"partially restrict Israel’s offensive in Rafah to the extent it implicates rights under the Genocide Convention.\" She warned that the ruling is \"susceptible to ambiguity and could be misunderstood or misconstrued as ordering an indefinite, unilateral cease-fire, thereby exemplifying an untenable overreach on the part of the Court.\"\nSmoke billows during Israeli bombardment in eastern Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 19, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\nThe judges’ ruling on Friday stopped short of ordering a full cease-fire across the entire Palestinian territory, and Israel is unlikely to comply with the court's ruling. Friday's decision comes just days after Norway, Ireland, and Spain said they would recognize the Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor of a separate international court sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as leaders of Hamas.\nSince Oct. 7, Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians.\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\nOriginal article source: Israel forced to work on Jewish Sabbath as UN court judge calls out colleagues in scathing dissent\nView comments",

    "text": "Baldur’s Gate 3 player shows simple trick to decimate undead armyLarian Studios\nMany Baldur’s Gate 3 players have recounted a myriad of battle strategies in this incredible TTRPG, and often, they decide to share their smoothest moves with the community. This time, a BG3 player has showcased the best way to deal with a pesky undead swarm.\nMost RPG players know that the undead are the most annoying (if not the worst) enemies you can face in a game, and in\nBaldur’s Gate 3, there’s no exception to the rule. Though brittle in comparison with other types of enemies, undead monsters have certain qualities that make them hard to deal with.\nWhen facing the undead enemies in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to be conscious of your surroundings and avoid getting swarmed. In small numbers, they represent a mild threat since they are pretty squishy. But the problem resides when their number multiplies significantly. More so if they are accompanied by Aberrations, Skeleton Champions, and Lesser\nDemons.\nBut a BG3 player found a smart way to deal with these pest-like enemies with ease, and they shared it on Reddit. Be advised though, that the following part contains spoilers for Acts 2 and 3.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nReddit user ‘Rain_BMW_46’ posted this on the\nhttps://baldursgate3.game/ subreddit: “Easy way to deal with Balthazar’s minions.” The OP then explained: “I had a lot of trouble with him, then I figured you can move the skeletons around before the fight. I clumped them all together with mage hand and used Ice Storm + Fireball to instantly wipe them out as soon as the fight begins.”\nMany players hurried to recognize the OP’s ingenuity, one of them, found this easy trick incredibly useful and said: “This is awesome. Thanks OP.” And another one wrote: “This is Genius. Never thought about that move!”\nMeanwhile, another BG3 enthusiast suggested: “Wait couldn’t you also push them off the edge with Thunderwave or whatever it’s called?” However, many players explained that the spell Thunderwave can be resisted by some of the undead enemies, thus making it ineffective in dealing with Balthazar’s army of the dead.\nIf you are considering yourself an undead army,\nthis Necromancer build is for you. But if you want to look for the quickest way to purge unholy creatures from existence, then we suggest the strongest Cleric Build.",

    "title": "Why do diets fail? Study discovers your fat cells remember being fat",
    "text": "ZÜRICH, Switzerland — If you’ve ever lost weight only to watch the pounds creep back on, you’re not alone. Now, scientists have uncovered a biological explanation for this frustrating phenomenon known as the “yo-yo effect” – and it turns out our fat cells have a surprisingly long memory.\nResearchers at ETH Zurich have discovered that being overweight leaves a lasting imprint on our fat cells through a process called epigenetics – chemical markers that act like tiny switches controlling which genes are turned on or off in our cells. These markers can persist for years, making it easier for the body to regain weight even after successful dieting.\n“The fat cells remember the overweight state and can return to this state more easily,” explains Professor Ferdinand von Meyenn, who led the study published in Nature.\nTo reach this conclusion, the research team first studied mice, examining fat cells from both overweight mice and those that had successfully lost weight through dieting. They found that obesity created distinctive epigenetic “stamps” on the fat cells that stubbornly remained even after weight loss. When these mice were later given access to high-fat foods, they regained weight more quickly than mice without these cellular memories.\nThe findings weren’t limited to mice. The team also analyzed fat tissue samples from formerly overweight people who had undergone weight loss surgery, using samples from medical centers in Sweden and Germany. While they looked at different cellular markers in the human samples, the results aligned with their mouse studies, suggesting that human fat cells also “remember” their previous size. Perhaps most striking is how long this cellular memory might last.\n“Fat cells are long-lived cells. On average, they live for ten years before our body replaces them with new cells,” says Laura Hinte, a doctoral student involved in the research.\nCurrently, there’s no way to erase these cellular memories with medication, though that could change in the future. For now, the researchers emphasize that prevention is key, particularly for young people.\n“It’s precisely because of this memory effect that it’s so important to avoid being overweight in the first place. Because that’s the simplest way to combat the yo-yo phenomenon,” von Meyenn notes.\nThe team is now investigating whether other types of cells, such as those in the brain or blood vessels, might also harbor memories of previous weight gain. If so, this could help explain why maintaining weight loss is such a complex challenge for so many people.\nThis breakthrough research not only helps explain a frustrating aspect of weight loss that millions have experienced but also underscores the importance of preventing weight gain in the first place – our cells, it seems, never quite forget.\nPaper Summary\nMethodology\nThis study investigated how the body “remembers” obesity, even after significant weight loss. Researchers analyzed human and mouse fat tissues before and after weight loss, focusing on how cells in these tissues change at the molecular level. Advanced techniques, like single-nucleus RNA sequencing, were used to zoom in on individual cells and see how their behavior changed.\nIn mice, researchers also studied how these changes impacted future weight gain after a high-fat diet. To dig deeper, they looked at the epigenetic “instructions” that control how fat cells function, identifying patterns that might explain why the body seems primed to regain weight.\nKey Results\nThe study found that both human and mouse fat tissues keep a “memory” of obesity. Even after weight loss, certain genes in fat cells stayed active or inactive in ways that made the cells less efficient. This “obesogenic memory” made it easier for the body to gain weight again.\nFor example, mice that lost weight regained it faster when put back on a high-fat diet compared to mice that were never obese. This suggests that weight loss doesn’t erase the body’s history of obesity—it leaves behind molecular traces that influence future weight and health.\nStudy Limitations\nIn humans, researchers could only analyze fat tissue from individuals who had bariatric surgery, which might not represent all forms of weight loss. Additionally, the molecular changes in mice may not perfectly match those in humans. The study also couldn’t confirm whether these epigenetic changes directly cause the “yo-yo” effect or if they’re just one piece of a larger puzzle.\nDiscussion & Takeaways\nThe research highlights a critical challenge in obesity treatment: even after significant weight loss, the body’s fat cells seem primed for weight regain. This discovery suggests that long-term weight management may require treatments targeting these persistent molecular changes. Future therapies might involve altering the epigenetic markers in fat cells to “erase” the memory of obesity. For now, the findings emphasize the importance of continuous lifestyle and dietary management after weight loss.\nFunding & Disclosures\nThis study was supported by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), which also provided open-access funding for publication. The research involved contributions from multiple institutions, reflecting a collaborative effort across international research centers. Authors affiliated with ETH Zurich and the Functional Genomics Center Zurich contributed to the study’s experimental design, data analysis, and human sample collection.\nResearcher Matthias Blüher received honoraria for consulting and speaking engagements with several pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. Researcher Mikael Rydén also received honoraria for similar roles with AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. No other authors reported conflicts of interest.",

    "title": "Una parada-nevera para esperar el autobús: el deseado refugio climático para combatir el hostil verano de Sevilla",
    "text": "El Ayuntamiento de Sevilla ha sacado a licitación pública la puesta en marcha en la ciudad de la primera parada de autobús que baja 20 grados la temperatura exterior mediante un prototipo desarrolla en la Universidad sevillana en los últimos años. Según se refleja en el documento de licitación y ha confirmado el creador del prototipo, el profesor investigador del Departamento de Ingeniería Energética de la Hispalense, José Sánchez, se trata de un contrato que asciende a 768.362,43 euros, impuestos incluidos, destinado a poner en marcha la citada marquesina climatizada, además de un aula abierta de colegio y una plaza bioclimática. Todo ello ubicado entres las calles Cruz Roja, Doctor Jiménez Díaz y Manuel Villalobos de la capital andaluza, con la posibilidad para las empresas interesadas de enviar sus ofertas antes del próximo 22 de julio. Un refugio climático La idea, que Sánchez sacó adelante junto a su compañera Mari Paz Montero y varios expertos más, se ha concebido como un refugio climático, y ejercería su función de enfriamiento durante las horas más calurosas del día, mediante un sistema de radiación térmica, una forma de transferencia de calor o frío que ocurre cuando un objeto emite ondas electromagnéticas debido a su temperatura. José Sánchez explica que no tiene nada que ver con un aparato de aire acondicionado, \\\"que se limita a producir aire frío, sino que la propia estructura de la parada emite frescor, como ocurre con los frigoríficos\\\", y funciona contra la \\\"situación hostil\\\" del verano sevillano, con una marquesina compuesta por un tanque subterráneo donde se almacena agua depurada que está conectado a la propia estructura mediante tubos que recorren su interior y hasta el techo, que es el lugar donde hay instalados sensores y placas solares. El ingenio posee un sistema de autosuficiencia que produce electricidad y agua fría, además de una serie de sensores que perciben la temperatura exterior, la presencia humana y el clima del entorno, de modo que \\\"toma decisiones\\\" de forma autónoma, por lo que detendría su funcionamiento en caso de que bajaran las temperaturas. Un sistema perfecto Todo ello gracias a que, por la noche, el agua del tanque asciende hacia las placas solares, se enfría y retorna al tanque subterráneo, donde se almacena y mantiene el frescor, mientras que no está siempre funcionando, sino que cuando la parada detecta mediante sus sensores la presencia de una o varias personas, activa su sistema de enfriamiento y el agua recorre el interior de la estructura. Para que sea eficaz, durante el día los paneles fotovoltaicos acumulan la energía que impulsa el agua, y el enfriamiento tiene una duración de 10 a 20 minutos, periodo máximo que un usuario suele esperar el autobús, un refugio climático que hace que, si se llega a él con 42 grados centígrados, la sensación térmica sería aproximadamente de 23. Su creador confía en que varias empresas opten a la licitación y se adjudique en breve, de modo que en el verano de 2025 puedan funcionar los primeros prototipos.",
