    "text": "Kent middle school student arrested following threat KENT, Ohio (WOIO) - A 14-year-old Stanton Middle School student was arrested Thursday after a school threat was reported late Wednesday night. According to Kent police, around 10 p.m. Wednesday evening they received a report that an eighth grade student was rumored to have a list of students’ names that he referred to as a “kill list.” Police immediately talked with the suspect and his parents, with the suspect denying that the list existed, or that he had any intentions to harm anyone. The suspect told police that he was joking. Police said no weapons were found and the student was kept out of school Thursday as a precaution. Investigations later uncovered the suspected “kill list,” leading police to issue an arrest warrant and take the 14-year-old into custody around 3 p.m. The Stanton Middle School student is charged with making false alarms, and Kent police continue to investigate the incident. “Kent PD takes any threat to our schools very seriously, and the safety of our students, staff and community will always be our highest priority,” police said.

    "text": "The Department of Health has received a batch of mpox specific treatment, Tecovirimat (also known as TPOXX or ST-246) for treatment of patients who experience severe health complications as a result of mpox disease. The process to secure more treatment including vaccine is underway in case the need arises. However, all mild cases will continue to be managed with supportive treatment used to manage complications like fever, pneumonia and skin infections. The department urges all people regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, with suspected mpox symptoms or who had physical contact with known cases to present themselves at the healthcare facility for clinical evaluation because anyone can contract this preventable and treatable disease. The country has detected six more laboratory-confirmed cases of mpox (previously known as monkey pox). This brings the total number of cases from 7 to 13 cases. Seven of the cases were confirmed in KwaZulu-Natal, five in Gauteng and one in the Western Cape. Hand hygiene is one of the effective ways to protect people from getting sick and prevent transmission of the diseases, hence people are reminded to always wash hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating or touching your face and after you use the bathroom. Some of the common symptoms of mpox include a rash which may last for 2â€“4 weeks, fever,headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands (lymph nodes). The painful rash looks like blisters or sores, and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles ofthe feet, groin, etc. For more information and media enquiries, please contact: Mr Foster Mohale Health Departmental Spokesperson 0724323792 [Foster.mohale@health.gov.za](mailto:Foster.mohale@health.gov.za) Mr Doctor Tshwale 063 657 8487 [Doctor.tshwale@health.gov.za](mailto:Doctor.tshwale@health.gov.za) EIN Presswire does not exercise editorial control over third-party content provided, uploaded, published, or distributed by users of EIN Presswire.

During the meeting, Siddiqui provided details about the upcoming activities under the Behavior Change Campaign. This initiative, part of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Services Improvement Project (KWSSIP) funded by the World Bank, is set to launch “WASH Wall Messages” in Essa Nagri in District East and Soba Nagar in Gulberg Town. These messages are designed to promote better hygiene practices and emphasize the importance of clean water and sanitation for public health. Both areas have faced significant challenges with water scarcity and inadequate sanitation. KWSSIP aims to address these issues by transforming infrastructure and engaging the community through sustainable social mobilization. Behavior change efforts are a key component of this project. The “WASH Wall Messages” will highlight practices such as handwashing, safe water use, and proper waste management to reduce waterborne diseases and improve health. Siddiqui noted, “These messages are crucial for driving better hygiene habits and enhancing community well-being.” The campaign will involve local WASH Committees, Children’s WASH Clubs, and community members to ensure the messages are culturally relevant and impactful. The broader KWSSIP initiative, in partnership with the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP), focuses on both infrastructure improvements and social mobilization, with a strong emphasis on empowering women in decision-making processes. Journalists affirmed their commitment to supporting this important cause and stressed the need for ongoing media engagement to maximize the campaign’s impact. The KWSSIP project remains dedicated to benefiting Karachi’s residents through both infrastructural upgrades and educational efforts.",

    "text": "En la Ciudad de México se estableció un nuevo récord histórico de temperatura máxima: 34.3 grados en la estación de Tacubaya, esto a causa de la segunda ola de calor que afecta a la mayor parte del país y [que también ocasiona efectos como una nueva contingencia ambiental](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/nacional/2024/5/9/otra-vez-la-contingencia-ambiental-estos-autos-no-circularan-manana-en-cdmx-edomex-814844.html), aparte de la alerta en el sistema eléctrico. La temperatura máxima histórica se registró en el Observatorio de Tacubaya donde los termómetros subieron a los 34.3 grados; mientras que la anterior marca era del 15 de abril de este año, cuando se alcanzaron los 34.2 grados. Esta marca también es la máxima para un 9 de mayo y para dicho mes. ¿Por qué Tacubaya es la zona donde hace más calor en la CDMX? La estación del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) ubicada en el Observatorio de Tacubaya es la que, históricamente, registra las mayores temperaturas en la Ciudad de México. Dicha instalación se ubica en lo alto de una loma al poniente de la capital del país, ya que también sirvió para realizar observaciones astronómicas desde 1878. José Martín Cortés, un meteorólogo consultado por El País, apunta a que estos récords se pueden deber a que la estación del Observatorio de Tacubaya se encuentra rodeada de asfalto, lo cual haría aumentar los valores, pues asegura que otras estaciones registran valores que sólo alcanzan los 31 ó 32 grados. Por ejemplo, la estación de Molino del Rey, que se encuentra a escasos 3.5 kilómetros, registró 32.1 grados este jueves 9 de mayo. Mientras que la estación de Tezontle, que se localiza en la alcaldía Iztacalco, registró una temperatura bastante similar, pues llegó a 32.3 grados este jueves. ¿El asfalto puede ser el culpable de que Tacubaya registre una mayor temperatura? De acuerdo con la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), el asfalto está compuesto por una serie de hidrocarbonos que reaccionan con el oxígeno presente en el aire y desprenden vapor, a esto se le suma que acumula radiación solar a causa de su tonalidad oscura, \"la radiación sobre el asfalto genera grandes acumulaciones de calor\". A todo esto se le suma un factor conocido como olas de calor, que son variaciones en las temperaturas máximas de diferentes regiones, sobre todo en las ciudades. Estas zonas de mayor temperatura están relacionadas con fenómenos como el fenómeno de El Niño y \"el crecimiento del asfalto urbano\", reitera la UNAM. Es importante precisar que las olas de calor en la CDMX son más comunes entre febrero y mayo, lo que puede ser causante de que se eleven las temperaturas en algunas zonas de la capital del país.",

    "text": "Pamire not happy with Zifa NC\nLovemore Dube\nFORMER Zifa president Vincent Pamire has castigated the Zifa Normalisation Committee for failing to give the nation hope on the way forward for the game.\nPamire was in charge of Zifa when Zimbabwe qualified for the 2004 Afcon finals held in Tunisia.\nIt was the first ever qualification for Afcon finals by Zimbabwe.\nThe Lincoln Mutasa normalisation committee was put in place by Fifa in July to chart a way forward for the game.\nSix months down the line, there has been little progress on what the nation expects according to Pamire.\nZimbabwe had been banned from international football for almost 18 months. During the time there were no international matches, referees were not given matches in continental and regional football and courses were frozen.\nWith the ban, Zifa were not getting any Fifa funding until July when the ban was lifted.\nBut now there are concerns that Mutasa and his team are not being open about their plan for Zimbabwe football.\n“These guys have been in office for six months and there are few tangibles to talk about if there are any. I am disappointed with the pace at which they are doing things.\n“We want football back to its feet run by people from within the game’s ecosystem. We can’t go on with temporary solutions, they are not meant to be there forever and their time is up in six months.\n“If we objectively look at their first six months what have they achieved? Is there hope for the game at this tortoise pace of doing things,” asked Pamire.\nThe normalisation committee’s term is up on June 30, 2024 and fears are that it is unlikely that elections would have been held at all levels and a new board put in place.\n“Another key assignment given to them is to organise elections. This entails putting in place electoral committee to oversee the process. Elections start at Area Zone level, you go to provinces, regions and then board.\n“This is a cumbersome exercise that should take longer than the six months of their tenure which is left.\n“This could point to that they know their stay will be extended otherwise they would have put in a better shift and ensured Zimbabweans run their game.\n“Whatever they are doing should be visible. Football can’t afford ambiguity. Let them share what they are doing, plans for the short term, medium term and long term which should be the culmination of elections and return of the Zifa Assembly and board to run Zimbabwe,” Pamire said.\nPamire also castigated individuals who are lining themselves up for positions.\n“The jockeying has started, people are strategically aligning themselves with individuals and groups. Foot-ball has always had order and a reward system for good leaders, man of integrity who are available to serve the game not for money but service to the nation and the game.\n“These should be identified by the people because this is not a job but voluntarism,” said Pamire.\nPamire was Zifa vice president from 1996 when he replaced Rodger Muhlwa who stepped down before winning the right to stay in power through elections from 1996 to 2003 when he was in charge for a few months after Leo Mugabe was recalled by Assembly.\nIn the few months he was at the helm Zimbabwe won the Cosafa Cup and qualified for the Afcon finals held in Tunisia in 2004. He was however beaten by Rafiq Khan in the Zifa elections held in November of 2003.",

A Axencia para a Modernización Tecnolóxica de Galicia respondeu así a unha consulta pública do Ministerio de Transformación Dixital e Función Pública ante a finalización do período de concesión deste servizo en xaneiro de 2025.\nNa actualidade, están considerados como parte do servizo universal as comunicacións fixas con capacidade de banda larga a unha velocidade mínima de 10 Mbps e os servizos de comunicacións vocais nunha localización fixa. Esta consideración debe manterse ata que se comprobe que calquera destes servizos poida ser proporcionado por calquera operador en competencia, condicións de prezo, cobertura e calidade de servizo. Para cambiar esta situación é necesario un informe da Comisión Nacional dos Mercados e da Competencia e audiencia ás partes interesadas. Neste contexto enmárcase a consulta pública do Goberno.\nNa súa resposta, a Xunta lembra que a telefonía fixa “continúa a ser de especial importancia entre a poboación de maior idade e de zonas máis rurais”. Tamén sinala que en Galicia “polas súas características orográficas e sociodemográficas, a dispoñibilidade da telefonía fixa no fogar segue a ser un servizo demandado e de vital importancia para as persoas de avanzada idade ou en situacións vulnerables, que aínda necesitan un terminal fixo de voz no día a día”.\nNa actualidade, nin o programa UNICO Demanda Rural, que remata en 2027, ni o resto dos programas estatais contemplan entre as obrigacións aos operadores a universalización deste servizo de voz nunha localización fixa coas necesarias garantías, calidade e prezo accesible.\nComo xa fixera en anteriores ocasión, no documento remitido hoxe ao ministerio, a Xunta volve a solicitar que a telefonía móbil de voz e datos sexa incluída no servizo universal, “ao menos nos municipios rurais e noutras zonas xeográficas con características sociais, económicas ou culturais especiais”. Cita como exemplos destas últimas o Camiño de Santiago, os parques naturais ou os grandes acontecementos.\nNeste sentido, lembra que “a necesidade de acceso a servizos de emerxencia en calquera situación e o potencial para a dinamización económica do rural fai que os servizos en mobilidade, tanto de datos como de voz, sexan necesarios e imprescindibles”.",

    "text": "Des détenus dans une cellule de la méga-prison du Centre de confinement contre le terrorisme (CECOT), le 21 août 2023 à Tecoluca, au Salvador ( AFP / Marvin RECINOS )\nQuelque 75.000 personnes ont été emprisonnées au Salvador dans le cadre de l'état d'urgence en vigueur depuis mars 2022. Si 7.000 ont été innocentées depuis, nombreuses seraient encore derrière les barreaux sans preuves, selon des ONG, dévoilant la face obscure de la \"guerre contre les gangs\" du président Nayib Bukele.\nSi la criminalité s'est effondrée dans le pays d'Amérique centrale, des organisations de défense de droits humains comme Amnesty international ou au Salvador le Mouvement des victimes du régime (Movir), dénoncent détentions arbitraires, mauvais traitements, cas de torture et même des décès dans les prisons.\n\"Certaines arrestations étaient fondées sur le seul fait que les personnes concernées avaient des tatouages, un casier judiciaire ou vivaient dans une zone contrôlée par des gangs\", dit Amnesty dans son rapport de décembre 2023.\nSandra, Maricela, Josefina et Irma, mères ou grand-mères de familles ayant en commun de vivre dans une extrême pauvreté, affirment à l'AFP que leurs proches sont des victimes innocentes des dérives de l'état d'urgence.\n- \"Des innocents meurent\" - Sandra Hernandez, 36 ans, mère de deux enfants de 17 et 13 ans, raconte dans sa maison sans eau ni électricité, à 50 km de San Salvador, l'arrestation de son mari, le 26 mai 2022.\nSandra Hernandez montre une photo de son mari Jose Medrano, décédé en détention, lors d'une interview avec l'AFP à El Rosario, le 29 janvier 2024 au Salvador ( AFP / STRINGER )\n\"Ils l'ont accusé d'appartenance à un gang. Il n'avait pas de tatouages\", assure-t-elle. En prison, José Medrano est tombé malade, souffrant d'insuffisance rénale.\nLa dernière fois que Sandra Hernandez et ses enfants l'ont vu, c'est lors d'un appel vidéo au moment de son transfert à l'hôpital pour une hémodialyse. Il y décédera le 26 mars 2023. \"Des innocents meurent, pas les membres des gangs (...) Ce qu'ils ont fait, c'est instaurer la terreur, et ce sont les pauvres gens qui tombent\", fustige-t-elle.\n- \"Peur qu'ils m'emmènent\" - Maricela Méndez raconte avoir été arrêtée chez elle, à Alta Vista, dans le nord-est de San Salvador, le 19 juillet 2022 et ses enfants alors âgés de 11 et 7 ans confiés à leur grand-mère.\nMaricela Méndez, qui a été détenue dans différentes prisons, tient sa fille dans ses bras, lors d'une interview avec l'AFP à San Salvador, le 29 janvier 2024 ( AFP / STRINGER )\n\"Ils m'ont accusée d'être une délinquante du quartier, la police avait un quota de cinq arrestations\", affirme-t-elle estimant avoir été dénoncée sans preuves par des voisins.\nElle a séjourné dans trois prisons, dormant à même le sol, nourrie de simples galettes de maïs et d'eau sucrée. \"Ils nous punissaient, nous battaient, ne nous donnaient pas d'eau\". Enceinte lors de son arrestation, elle a obtenu une libération conditionnelle deux mois avant l'accouchement. A sa sortie, son mari l'avait quittée.\nCette mère de 35 ans qui travaille dans un salon de beauté dit ses enfants \"traumatisés\". \"Lorsqu'ils voient une patrouille de police, ils pleurent, ils ont peur qu'ils m'emmènent à nouveau. Je ressens la même peur\".\n- \"Ils n'enquêtent pas\" - Les yeux gonflés d'avoir mal dormi à côté du berceau où se reposent ses petits-enfants de deux et trois ans et demi, Josefina Bonilla essuie ses larmes.\nJosefina Bonilla, qui s'occupe de ses deux petis-enfants pendant la détention de sa fille Stefany Santos, lors d'une interview avec l'AFP à Soyapango, le 29 janvier 2024 au Salvador ( AFP / STRINGER )\nElle dit n'avoir \"pas de nouvelles\" de sa fille Stefany Santos, 24 ans, arrêtée le 2 juin 2022. La grand-mère évoque un conflit avec la famille du père, assassiné pour un problème de dettes.\n\"Elle est innocente. Ils arrêtent des gens et n'enquêtent pas\", affirme-t-elle dans sa modeste maison de Soyapango, disant vivre grâce à l'aide de voisins.\n\"Ma fille est asthmatique et a des problèmes psychologiques. Je suis inquiète qu'elle n'ait pas de médicaments\", se lamente-t-elle, déplorant qu'en un an et demi, elle n'ait pu lui apporter que trois colis de nourriture et de vêtements.\n- Avenir \"volé\" - Irma Garcia, 42 ans, dit vouloir parler pour ne plus se sentir \"impuissante\" après l'arrestation de son fils, bientôt 18 ans ce 7 juin 2022, dans l'atelier de mécanique où il travaillait.\nIrma Garcia tient une photo de son fils Isaias Galicia, emprisonné, dont elle n'a pas de nouvelle, lors d'une interview avec l'AFP à Mejicanos, le 28 janvier 2024 au Salvador ( AFP / STRINGER )\n\"Depuis qu'ils l'ont emmené, je ne l'ai plus vu. Je ne sais pas s'il va bien, s'il est vivant\", dit-elle dans sa chambre à Mejicanos, au nord de San Salvador.\n\"Mon fils n'est pas membre d'un gang, il n'a pas de tatouages, il n'a fait de mal à personne\", assure-t-elle, évoquant une dénonciation anonyme.\n\"Ils arrêtent des jeunes innocents, ils volent leurs rêves, leur avenir, comme celui de mon fils\", se lamente cette veuve, mère de trois autres enfants de 13, 15 et 21 ans qui dit vivre \"avec l'inquiétude qu'on me dise qu'il a été tué\".",

    "text": "Opioid-fighting windfall sitting unspent in Massachusetts municipal coffers\nUse it or lose it. That's the message from one state lawmaker to cities and towns across the state over their sitting on more than $80 million in money given to them to fight opioid addiction.\n\"You've had more than ample time to do this. Get this money out the door. People are dying,\" said state Sen. John Velis, D-Westfield. \"I fundamentally do not understand why municipalities are slow rolling this the way that they are.\"\nVelis, himself in recovery, has served as Senate chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery. He said if cities and towns don't start spending the money, the state should consider taking the money back.\n\"We know the gold standard. Get Narcan out there. Focus on harm reduction, focus on prevention,\" he said. \"We are getting dangerously close to the point where I would say that if that money isn't going to get out there, is it time to set deadlines? And if deadlines aren't met, to kind of bring that money back, almost some type of a clawback provision.\"\nThe money comes from the state's share of the national opioid settlement fund, a landmark deal with opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers to settle lawsuits in exchange for payments over time.\nMassachusetts is set to receive $1 billion over 18 years, with 60% going to the state to spend and the rest mostly going to cities and towns, with the requirement that the money be spent on things like prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery.\nIn the last two years, Massachusetts cities and towns have received $91 million in opioid settlement funds but spent just $6.7 million, according to the state Department of Public Health. That's just 7%of the money in hand, with more on the way.\nIn all, 135 communities had not used any of the opioid settlement money they received, according to state data analyzed by 5 Investigates. And the vast majority of cities and towns spent less than 10% of the money.\nIn the two years since the money began flowing, at least an estimated 4,000 people have died in Massachusetts from opioid-related overdoses.\nSee how much opioid settlement money your city and town has received and spent so far.\nThe city of Lynn received $1.5 million in opioid settlement funds in the first two years of the program, the beginning of what's expected to be about $6 million in all over the next 13 years.\nIt has paid for a community wellness vending machine that gives 24-hour access to everything from sexual health supplies to wound care kits. It has funded naloxone, the drug that can reverse overdoses, and sharps containers for used needles.\nBut the city has only spent about $120,000 of what it has on hand. While deaths are down, 45 people from Lynn died from overdoses in 2023, the ninth hardest-hit community in the state.\nCandice McClory, the city's substance use coordinator, defended the pace of spending.\n\"It's really important for us to make sure that we're not spending down to the dollar. We don't know what funding will look like in the future,\" she said. \"I feel like we, as the city of Lynn are doing exactly what we're supposed to be doing. We have spent a lot more money than other cities.\"\nBoston, with the highest number of fatal overdoses, also is set to receive the most money: $39 million through 2038. So far, the city has received $12 million but only spent $525,880 as of Feb. 7.\nBoston Public Health Commission executive director Dr. Bisola Ojikutu said all of Boston's $12 million has been allocated, but the city did not provide a detailed breakdown of where the money's going.\n\"Obviously this crisis is not going away, so we're not spending the money as one lump sum. Instead, we're spending this money that we have currently that's been allocated over the course of the next four years,\" she said.\nVideo: Boston has the highest number of fatal overdoses in Massachusetts\nAcross the river in Cambridge, 31 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2023. It's only spent 4% — $170,325 — of the $4.6 million received so far in opioid settlement funds. It's receiving $16.2 million in all.\nThat money paid for a medical outreach van, run by CASPAR, the Cambridge And Somerville Programs for Addiction Recovery, to meet people in the community.\n\"They stay outside, they don't deal with the problem. And so bringing it to them and also being able to see the actual situation in the van with the right lighting has been huge,\" said Alexis Grandberg, director of the First Step Outreach program\nThe city said it will spend about $600,000 a year for the van's operations and it is still evaluating how to spend the rest of the money.\nAdam Chapdelaine, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, said city and town leaders want to be responsive to the opioid crisis. Some of the delays at first were caused by a technical difficulty that cities and towns had accessing the funds.\n\"It certainly could display a lack of urgency, but I have a confidence that the communities are trying to plan for the best use of those funds,\" he said.\nThe Mass. Department of Public Health initially refused to release detailed, municipal-level data to 5 Investigates, only doing so after we appealed to the Secretary of State's office.\nThat data shows that just four Massachusetts cities have spent all of the money. One of those is the central Massachusetts city of Gardner.\n\"It was one of those things that once we had an idea in place, it was pretty easy to put all the puzzle pieces together. It took us about a week,\" said Gardner Mayor Michael Nicholson.\nGardner partnered with neighboring communities to fund a recovery support navigator who responds after an overdose.\n\"They'll do an assessment with the individual or the family, whatever it may be, and really get a feel for what kind of need that person has,\" explained Shawn Hayden, president of GAAMHA, a human services provider in Gardner, which received the opioid settlement money to pay for the shared clinician.\nHayden understands first-hand how resources can make a difference. He started at GAAMHA as a client.\n\"My introduction to opioids started with a back injury and a well-intentioned family practitioner and a prescription,\" he said.\nThat prescription launched him on the path to addiction. He ended up in and out of jail.\n\"My own life had become a mess through my own struggle with opioids. And in 2009, I was homeless and pretty helpless,\" he said.\nHis message: recovery is possible, and the opioid settlement funds can help.\n\"Are you surprised to hear that some communities are having trouble apparently spending this money?\" 5 Investigates' Mike Beaudet asked.\n\" I don't know if I'm surprised, disappointed. I think,\" he said.",
