    "text": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes [will shift away from military commanders](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190731402/military-code-sexual-assault-biden-gillibrand) to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's [Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military](https://www.sapr.mil/sites/default/files/public/docs/reports/AR/FY22/DOD_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military_FY2022.pdf) showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3627334/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-offices-of-special/), Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the [National Institute of Military Justice](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nimj.org/__;!!Iwwt!UbPCvSmbGISuvrCLw1BPxxJS6qOL83gyaz8yBDSEXfcqUNpX0M2GK3oeNrdji2ifc4zOhakHQBUDl2_hTJPlMVGkag$), said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will still be handled by those in the chain of command who are no longer trusted to decide whether to charge murder or rape. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias, then this is all for naught.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "title": "Opinion | Why Was It So Hard for Nikki Haley to Say \"Slavery\"? Civil War History Has the Answer - POLITICO",
    "text": "The presidential candidate’s recent (and swiftly qualified) comments about the Civil War helped spread a myth that has warped American history for over a century. In William Faulkner’s novel, Sartoris, someone asks the title character, Colonel John Sartoris, why he had fought for the Confederacy so many decades before. “Damned if I ever did know,” replied the aging veteran, now a pillar of his community in fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. Of course, we know why Colonel Sartoris raised arms against the United States. So does anyone with a high school diploma — assuming they used up-to-date textbooks. And so did Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, who in 1861 famously asserted that the “cornerstone” of the new Southern nation rested “upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.” All of which makes it disappointing, though not surprising, that at this late date — almost 160 years after the Civil War — Nikki Haley, a leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination, shares Colonel Sartoris’ selective amnesia on the topic. When asked a softball question this week about the causes of the Civil War, Haley, a former South Carolina governor, flubbed the answer , calling it a “difficult” question and mumbling on about “basically how government was going to run — the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.” This morning, Haley qualified the comment on a radio show called “The Pulse of New Hampshire,” and followed the clean-up job with a press release, stating: “Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government.” But as Haley must know — after all, as governor of South Carolina, she presided over the removal of Confederate flags from the Statehouse — many Americans do question the fundamental fact that slavery precipitated the Civil War, and her equivocation played into a long-standing agenda to rewrite American history. Haley was effectively parroting the Lost Cause mythology, a revisionist school of thought born in the war’s immediate aftermath, which whitewashed the Confederacy’s cornerstone interest in raising arms to preserve slavery. Instead, a generation of Lost Cause mythologists chalked the war up to a battle over political abstractions like states’ rights. With red states doing battle with American history , seeking to erase the legacy of violence and inequality that counterbalance the great good also inherent in our national story, it’s worth revisiting the rise of the Lost Cause, not just to remember how damaging it was, but to confront just how damaging it still is. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the work of interpreting the rebellion fell to a small group of unreconstructed rebels. The pioneers of Confederate revisionism included wealthy and influential veterans of the Confederacy like Jubal Early, B. T. Johnson, Fitz Lee and W. P. Johnson, who helped formulate the Lost Cause myth that would take hold by the 1880s. The narrative strains were simple. They painted a picture of Southern chivalry — mint juleps, magnolias and moonlight — that stood in sharp contrast with the North, a region marked by avarice, grinding capitalism and poverty. The rebellion, by this rendering, had been a legal response to the North’s assault on states’ rights — not a violent insurrection to preserve chattel slavery. Even Confederate veterans like Hunter McGuire knew that to admit the war had been about slavery would “hold us degraded rather than worthy of honor … our children, instead of revering their fathers will be secretly, if not openly, ashamed.” The myth gained steamed by the end of the century, largely because of the work of organizations like the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), groups that offered a compelling story that people could wrap their minds around — including many Northerners, who were eager to put the war behind them. Because the Lost Cause emphasized heroism and honor over slavery, it venerated military figures like Robert E. Lee and swept politicians like Jefferson Davis under the rug. So it was that in May 1890 over 100,000 citizens gathered in Richmond for the dedication of a statue of Lee. The decade saw hundreds of towns across the former Confederacy raise similar monuments to their heroes and war dead. These marble and steel memorials were often planted in town squares and by county courthouses to help sanitize not only Confederate memory but the new Jim Crow order. After all, if secession had been a noble thing, so was the separation of the races. The signs of revisionism ranged from subtle to clear. During the war, for instance, Confederate soldiers had keenly embraced the term “reb,” but the new gatekeepers of Southern memory abandoned the term. “Was your father a Rebel and a Traitor?” asked a typical leaflet. “Did he fight in the service of the Confederacy for the purpose of defeating the Union, or was he a Patriot, fighting for the liberties granted him under the Constitution, in defense of his native land, and for a cause he knew to be right?” Equally important was figuring out what to even call the war. It couldn’t be the “Civil War,” which sounded too revolutionary. It couldn’t be “the War of Rebellion” which smacked of treason. In the late 1880s, the UCV and UDC approved resolutions designating the conflict that killed 750,000 Americans the “War Between the States.” The term stuck for generations to come. It wasn’t just Southerners who suffered willful memory loss in these years. Jaded by the experience of Reconstruction and in the thrall of rising scientific racism, many Northerners were equally eager to remember the war as a brothers’ quarrel over politics rather than a struggle over slavery and Black rights. The jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who began the war as a committed abolitionist, later erased the roots of the conflict and celebrated the battlefield valor of both Union and Confederate troops. “The faith is true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty,” he said, “in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has little notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use.” Of course, historians agree that most Union troops did know why they were fighting. So did Holmes. But years after the fact, he was willing to forget. As were tens of thousands of veterans who attended Blue and Gray reunions well into the 20th century, including a massive camp gathering of 25,000 people who gathered at Crawfish Springs, Georgia, in 1889, near the Chickamauga Battlefield, for a picnic and public speeches. These mass spectacles helped Yankees and Confederates rewrite the history of the 1850s and 1860s, ostensibly in the service of national reunion and regeneration, but also in a way that fundamentally reinforced the emerging culture and politics of Jim Crow. The Lost Cause mythology was more than bad history. It provided the intellectual justification for Jim Crow — not just in the former Confederacy, but everywhere systemic racism denied Black citizens equal citizenship and economic rights. Its dismantling began only in the 1960s when historians inspired by the modern Civil Rights Movement revisited the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction, adopting the views of earlier Black scholars like W.E.B. DuBois and John Hope Franklin, who always knew what the war was about and had shined a spotlight on the agency of Black and white actors alike. That’s why the recent retreat to Lost Cause mythos is troubling. One would think that a Republican candidate for the presidency might be proud of the party’s roots as a firmly antislavery organization that dismantled the “Peculiar Institution” and fomented a critical constitutional revolution during Reconstruction — one that truly made the country more free. With GOP presidential candidates waffling on the Civil War, rejecting history curricula in their states and launching political fusillades against “woke” culture, it remains for the rest of us to reaffirm the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, who in the last years of his life stated: “Death has no power to change moral qualities. What was bad before the war, and during the war, has not been made good since the war. … Whatever else I may forget, I shall never forget the difference between those who fought for liberty and those who fought for slavery.”",

    "text": "A young NI man is taking on the London Marathon this weekend to raise funds for Cancer Fund for Children.\n20-year-old James Greer&apos;s younger brother Daniel (16) was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2022, with the Newry family having been supported by the charity.\nDaniel has undergone three stem cell transplants and is currently still in hospital.\nREAD MORE: Co Antrim mum diagnosed with stage 4 cancer after being told she was too young\nREAD MORE: Family raise over £10k in one day for mum battling bowel cancer\nThe brothers&apos; mum Anne told Belfast Live that Daniel received his Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) diagnosis in June 2022.\nShe said: \"He had a bit of back pain, I took him to the GP to get some bloods done and she rang me that evening to say we needed to look at it further, that potentially it didn&apos;t look great.\nBrothers Daniel and James Greer (Image: Submitted) \"He was admitted the following day to the Royal in Belfast and had further tests, and was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). From [that] June, he had two very intense rounds of chemotherapy. He had ten days of chemo the first round and was in hospital for nearly seven weeks at that stage, then got out for a couple of days, and started the second round, the same thing all over again.\n\"Between round one and round two we discovered that had what is called high-risk AML, which meant that he had a genetic change in his cells and that is why then we knew he was going to need a bone marrow transplant.\n\"So then the search was on for a donor and to try and raise awareness of bone marrow/stem cell donation. We were unsuccessful, we found there were potential donors that then fell through for various reasons, so we were delayed then further waiting.\"\nThe mum-of-two added that by the time a suitable donor was found, Daniel had to have another reduced dose of chemo \"to try to keep his disease at bay\".\nDaniel, with his parents Anne and Paul, was then flown by Air Ambulance to Bristol on October 10, 2022, and he had his first bone marrow transplant ten days later.\nAnne added: \"We remained in Bristol until 21st December, we got home then and he hit one complication after the other. We were daily running up and down to Belfast.\nAnne, Daniel, James and Paul (Image: Submitted) \"When we took him back to clinic on January 3, he had shingles and was admitted. He practically spent all of January to the end of June 2023 in the Royal or then back to Bristol.\n\"He has practically lived in hospital for the last two years.\"\nDaniel has since had two further stem cell transplants.\nAnne said: \"The second one was on January 31, 2024 in Manchester. We were absolutely devastated mid February when we were told it hadn&apos;t worked.\n\"The third was in February, the following week and it was split over two days, they gave us the option of &apos;we don&apos;t think this is going to work, take him home&apos;, but it has miraculously.\n\"We didn&apos;t think we would get this far to be perfectly honest. Because in November 2023... he had a form of palliative chemotherapy. But he has such fight in him. He has such determination, he turned a corner.\"\nThe Greer family have been helped by Cancer Fund for Children, which offers support to families in their home, in the community, on the hospital ward and at Daisy Lodge, a purpose-built therapeutic centre.\nJames and Daniel earlier this month (Image: Submitted) Anne explained: \"When Daniel has been in Belfast on the ward, there have been Cancer Support Specialists. Daniel had a girl called Lucy Ford, just bubbly, bright, young, fun. She would call in and out, sometimes she would just sit and talk to him if he&apos;s not feeling great or he&apos;s not up to playing a game, just for a change of a face.\n\"Daniel has been in complete isolation every time he&apos;s been in hospital, the only people he seen were the nurses, doctors, me and his dad.\n\"Lucy would call in and bring a bit of brightness and cheer. Distraction from the horrible hell he&apos;s been in.\"\nAnne also highlighted the difference Cancer Support Specialist Gareth also made to their family.\nThe Newry woman continued: \"He&apos;s also been a brilliant support for James, Daniel&apos;s older brother.\"\nJames takes on the London Marathon this weekend (Image: Submitted) James takes on the London Marathon on Sunday, with his mum feeling \"exceptionally proud\" of him.\nAnne said: \"It has been very hard for him, he has no other siblings. Myself and Paul are completely wrapped up in Daniel&apos;s care and I&apos;m sure at times, he has never voiced it, but I&apos;m sure at times it has been a very lonely path for him.\n\"James is the only one running for Cancer Fund For Children. He was only 19 at the time when he decided he was going to do it to give something back, still in the throws of all of this.\"\nShe added: \"We&apos;ve been offered multiple breaks at Daisy Lodge, which we&apos;ve been so looking forward to and then unfortunately Daniel, with another complication, we&apos;ve had to cancel. This is other work that they do, and we are so much looking forward to be able to do that when Daniel is well enough.\"\nThe Newry brothers (Image: Submitted) On his fundraising page, James said: \"Throughout the course of Daniel’s battle, these amazing workers have been there for him, whether that be someone to sit and play Xbox with him (because we all know how tech savvy mum and dad are), or to listen to his worries or fears and bring a voice of reassurance, and even call out to the house in the evenings and check in on us all or to grab a coffee if one of us needs a chat.\n\"Without their hard work, dedication and selflessness, Daniel’s battle would be almost impossible.\n\"And Daniel isn’t the only recipient of their support. The ward is full of children in Daniel’s situation, who all can avail of the support of this amazing charity, so please, if you can spare anything, consider donating to this charity. Every penny you give massively changes the lives of all the children that are helped by these workers.\"\nYou can donate to James&apos;s fundraiser for Cancer Fund For Children HERE .

    "text": "By Ben Crnic ,\n4 hours ago\nAfter nearly three decades, a nursery school in Westchester has announced that it will shut its doors for good.\nNew Beginnings Nursery School , located in Tarrytown at the Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns at 42 North Broadway (Route 9), is now closed, owner Patricia Kreamer announced on Wednesday, Aug. 14.\nAccording to Kreamer, the church's consistory voted on Tuesday, Aug. 6 to close the school \"without any regard\" to the school's staff or families.\n\"I was not allowed to voice my concerns or advocate for our school since it was behind closed doors,\" Kreamer said in her announcement.\nNew Beginnings was originally founded in 1996 when Kreamer was searching for a school for her 3-year-old daughter. She decided to team up with the church, which had been looking to begin a school at the time.\nThe Christian school accepted families and children of all religious backgrounds and served those aged 2 to 4, according to its website.\nIn her closing announcement, Kreamer thanked those who helped support the school over the years.\n\"I am so grateful for every person who has been a part of our NBNS family!\" Kreamer wrote, adding, \"Whether you attended a spaghetti dinner, donated, referred someone, or simply walked through the doors, your presence has meant the world to me!\"\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Hasta el momento solo se había pagado el de diciembre, pero no se sabía qué decisión iba a tomar el gobierno de Milei.\n(Foto: ANSES) Bono ANSES de $55.000: quiénes lo cobrarán en enero y febrero de 2024 El refuerzo extraordinario de $55.000 está destinado a:\nJubilados y pensionados que no superen el haber mínimo ( $105.713 ). Titulares de la Pensión No Contributiva (PNC). Jubilados que no accedieron a moratorias ni planes de pago. Titulares de la Pensión Universal para el Adulto Mayor ( PUAM ). Ley Ómnibus: el Gobierno busca suspender la movilidad jubilatoria Javier Milei envió la Ley Ómnibus al Congreso para hacer una reforma del Estado. Dentro de los temas que contempla el proyecto, busca suspender la movilidad jubilatoria y los aumentos podrían definirse por decreto. El Presidente ya envió el proyecto al Congreso y se espera que sea tratado en los próximos días.\nLeé también: Cambios en el plazo fijo UVA: serán como mínimo de 6 meses y tendrán un límite de $5 millones\nEl capítulo III del proyecto plantea quitar la actual modalidad de las prestaciones establecidas en la Ley 24.241. Por medio del artículo 106, le otorgarían al Poder Ejecutivo la autoridad para definir una fórmula que ajuste automáticamente , “teniendo en cuenta la justicia y la sostenibilidad económica”.\nEl documento también aclara que mientras se establece esta fórmula automática, el Gobierno tendrá la facultad de realizar aumentos periódicos , dando prioridad a los beneficiarios de más bajos ingresos, es decir, a los jubilados y pensionados que cobran la mínima.\nMientras no se apruebe el proyecto de Ley Ómnibus, seguirá rigiendo la fórmula actual , vigente desde 2021, que actualiza los haberes de los jubilados cada tres meses.\nEl último ajuste que surgió de esta fórmula dio un aumento del 20,87% desde diciembre y el próximo aumento se definiría en marzo. Este suba dependerá de lo que defina el Congreso en sesiones extraordinarias.",

    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list.\nThe newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder.\nKempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year.\nGrace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan have been honoured (PA) Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”.\nThey described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to.\n“She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.”\nLove Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls.\nGrace Millane was murdered (Lucie Blackman Trust/PA) Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive.\n“If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that.\n“We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area.\n“This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter.\n“So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace.\n“We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.”\nThe handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said.\nShe added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag.\n“Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace.\n“We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.”\nThe next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it.\n“Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.”\nSince Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women.\nThe body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland.\nIn February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far.\nHe was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane.\nThe rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane.\nThe sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "text": "By Julia Mueller ,\n2 hours ago ( The Hill ) — A Republican candidate in Missouri who has faced sharp criticism for anti-LGBTQ videos during the race for secretary of state lost her Tuesday night primary by a big margin.\nRepublican Valentina Gomez had sparked controversy earlier this year over a video in which she lit LGBTQ-inclusive books on fire, pledging to “burn” such books if she won the office and touting former President Trump’s Make America Great Again platform.\nIn May, she drew harsh blowback from Democrats and LGBTQ rights groups over a video in which she advised voters not to be “weak and gay.” Another recent post on a gender controversy at the Olympics was flagged on X as a potential violation of the platform’s “rules against Hateful Conduct.”\nTeachers swoon over Walz joining Democratic ticket “To all LGBTQIA Missourians, your existence should not be used as a political football,” Missouri state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade (D), who won the Democratic primary for governor, said after the May post .\nGomez boasts nearly a quarter of a million followers on X, but came in single-digits during the Tuesday night Republican primary.\nShe earned just 7.4 percent of the vote, according to the latest tallies from Decision Desk HQ , sixth place in the crowded field with 94 percent of ballots tallied.\n18 House Republicans ask Johnson not to target IRA clean energy tax credits Missouri state Sen. Denny Hoskins emerged the winner , scoring roughly a quarter of the vote.\nThough Gomez is out of the race, Hoskins has also come under scrutiny for anti-LGBTQ moves, including voting last year for a bill in the state Senate aimed at banning gender-affirming care for trans youth.\nNearly $1 million in Harris-Walz camo hats sold since launch Hoskins was a founding member of the Missouri state senate’s hard-right Freedom Caucus, according to the Kansas City Star , and is vying to succeed Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft (R), who lost his primary bid for Missouri governor on Tuesday.\nHoskins will go up against Democratic state Rep. Barbara Phifer in the fall.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
