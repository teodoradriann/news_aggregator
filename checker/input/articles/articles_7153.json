    "text": "Unlocking Gold’s Rally: Technical Analysis Points to New Heights [Bruce Powers](/author/brucepowers) Gold Forecast Video for 08.01.24 by Bruce Powers [Gold](https://www.fxempire.com/commodities/gold) drops to a new retracement low before finding support at the uptrend line and turning higher with enthusiasm. The subsequent advance triggered an inside day breakout of yesterday’s relatively narrow range day and tested resistance just below the three-day high. It looks like it will close green for the day and above support of the 20-Day MA, currently at 2,037. Support was seen at a price of 2,024 and today’s high is 2,064. Today Should Set Stage for Higher Prices Today’s price action should begin to set the stage for a continuation of the rally into higher target zones. A daily close above the 20-Day MA and subsequent advance will confirm a successful test of support of the 20-Day line. Since today’s high is close to the three-day high of 2,066, the three-day high should provide a more reliable signal of strength. If triggered gold should be complete with the minor retracement and ready to proceed to higher prices. Short-term Targets Tested First The next higher short-term targets begin with the recent swing high of 2,088 (B), followed quickly by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at 2,100. Further up into record high territory is the completion of a rising ABCD pattern at 2,140. Moreover, given the symmetry (measured moves) between the two prior rallies, gold would be expected to eventually reach a 2,177-price target at a minimum. Swing Symmetry Points to 2,146 To illustrate, the previous two rallies show symmetry in both time and price. Starting from the recent trend low from October 6 gold rallied 199 points or 11% in 16 days. Subsequently, the second leg up began off the November 13 swing low. It saw the price of gold rise by 203 points or 10.5% in 16 days. Although the current advance begun from the December 13 swing low matches time today, it looks like it will mark a bottom rather than a top. We can also derive an extended target for time by multiplying 16 days by the 127.2% Fibonacci ratio, which comes to 20 days. The price target which will match the previous 203-point advance is 2,177.

Florida starting offensive guard Micah Mazzccua is expected to enter the transfer portal, a source tells [@247sports]. Mazzccua was a standout guard at Baylor before transferring to Florida last year. [https://t.co/qgXqEAp4Fr] [pic.twitter.com/8N2MfajT8Z] — Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) [December 29, 2023] Mazzccua was a standout guard for the Baylor Bears before transferring to the Gators for the 2023 season. Mazzccua started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gators in 2023. Mazzccua is the 19th player to enter the portal for the Gators in 2023. Fellow standouts Princely Umanmielen, Trevor Etienne, and Will Norman are other notable Gators who went in the portal at the conclusion of the regular season. The Gators have added one offensive lineman thus far. Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson comes to Gainesville from San Diego State and should provide depth to a thin unit. The Gators struggled mightily in pass protection in 2023. The unit finished No. 115 in sacks allowed, giving up 39 on the season. The unit was much better at run blocking as the team averaged just under 150 yards per game on the ground.",

    "text": "Key Points Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has used a speech at the United Nations to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Abbas urged a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the enclave. Israel's UN ambassador responded to Abbas in a statement, criticising his failure to condemn Hamas' October 7 attack. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has urged the United Nations General Assembly to stop the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants, saying Israel has almost entirely destroyed the enclave and it is no longer fit for life.\n\"This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people,\" he told the 193-member General Assembly on Thursday.\nHamas-led militants stormed Israeli communities on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza.\nSince then, Israel&apos;s military has destroyed large areas of the Palestinian enclave, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.\nREAD MORE Penny Wong voices support for Palestinian self-determination despite abstaining on UN vote\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying unsuccessfully to broker a ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas.\nDuring his speech, Abbas called for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, an end to attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza and a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the enclave.\n\"We refuse the establishment of buffer zones or taking any part from Gaza,\" he said.\n\"We will not allow a single centimetre of Gaza to be taken. The State of Palestine must shoulder its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and impose its full mandate on it and jurisdiction on it.\"\nREAD MORE Israel rejects calls for a 21-day Lebanon-border ceasefire and continues deadly airstrikes\nAbbas said the Palestinian Authority, which he leads, should have control over all Palestinian territories and that it would hold elections once the war is over.\nIsrael&apos;s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, responded to Abbas’ speech in a statement, accusing him of only talking about a peaceful solution when he is at the UN and failing to condemn the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",

    "text": "Warm temperatures have continued into the weekend as we saw the mid 80s this afternoon. Paired with that was abundant sunshine which made for a perfect Saturday outside. These above average temperatures and clear conditions will continue into our Sunday. High pressure will keep us dry and keep those skies clear if anyone is planning on heading to the park or the pumpkin patch. Temperatures will start in the upper 50s and rise into the upper 80s and maybe even low 90s for some of us. This is abnormally warm for this time of year, but that'll change quickly into the work week. A cold front will move through the area Monday morning causing those temperatures to change as soon as that afternoon. High temperatures for Monday will be in the low to mid 70s. Much more like what we'd expect this time of year. The cold front will be a dry front, so no rain and barely even any clouds are expected for the start of our work week. As the week continues, the temperatures get colder and colder. By midweek, our high temperatures will only be in the mid 60s and low temperatures will be in the low 40s with some of us seeing the upper 30s. It may be time to check on those heaters if you haven't already.",
