Battue par la taïwanaise Lin Yu Ting, l’une des deux boxeuses au cœur d’une controverse sur le genre, la Turque Esra Yildiz Kahraman s’est fendue d’un geste pour dénoncer implicitement la présence de cette dernière dans le tournoi olympique féminin.\nAprès avoir été battue aux points, par décision partagée, en demi-finale des -57 kg de ces Jeux olympiques, Esra Yildiz Kahraman est retournée au milieu du ring et fait un X avec ses doigts, pour représenter le signe des chromosomes XX, et ainsi pester contre la présence de son adversaire sur le ring. Un\ngeste qu’avait déjà réalisé la Bulgare Svetlana Staneva dimanche matin, qui était sortie furieuse suite à sa défaite contre Lin Yu-ting en quart de finale.\nTout comme pour la boxeuse algérienne Imane Khelif,\nla présence de Lin Yu-ting a beaucoup fait parler depuis le début de ces Jeux olympiques à cause de son hyperandrogénie, et des fausses allégations affirmant qu’il s’agit d’un « homme ». Les deux femmes avaient été exclues des Championnats du monde 2023 à New Delhi car elles avaient soi-disant échoué à un test destiné à établir leur genre, selon la Fédération internationale de boxe (IBA).\nSi leur éligibilité ne fait aucun doute pour le Comité international olympique (CIO), de nombreuses personnes, dont des boxeuses, ont remis en cause leur participation. C’est notamment le cas de la hongroise Anna Luca Hamori, qui avait\nmultiplié les provocations avant son combat perdu contre Imane Khelif.\nMalgré les critiques, Imane Khelif et Lin Yu-ting combattront toutes les deux pour l’or, vendredi et samedi, respectivement dans les catégories -66 kg et -57 kg.",

    "title": "Worship for sale: Rescuing the Nigerian church from the hands of praise and worship \"dealers\"  (1), By Ayo Akerele",
    "text": "“My fee is one million naira for a two-hour session of worship, amounting to a service charge of N500,000 per hour. Any additional worship will require you to top up my fees. Your invoice will be issued by my manager.” How low could a man fall as a worship minister? At the root of this widespread desecration of the sacred music ministry is the spirit of mammon which obviously is a major stronghold in the Nigerian church. It is the same spirit working on the hearts of several ministers of the word at several levels of ministry. But my focus today is within the scope of the music ministry.\nAs far as I’m concerned, music dealership has taken over music leadership in the church, resulting in the pollution of the sacred altar of Christ. These breeds of worship leaders (dealers) share striking similarities with the biblical sons of Eli — Hophni and Phinehas whom God judged for their attitudes towards His sacred Altar.\nIn 1 Samuel 2:17, the Bible says, “The sin of the sons of Eli was extremely serious in the Lord’s sight, because they treated the offerings to the Lord with such disrespect.” It has never been this bad in the Nigerian church. I was privileged to know the Lord in the early 80s. There was no time in the history of the Church that the offering of praise and worship became a commercialized venture for branding and marketing purposes.\nToday, it is an industry of proud, arrogant, greedy, and egocentric people—many of whom are not really saved, much less being broken.\n|\n---|\nWe have lost it completely in this aspect of our service to God, and the earlier the fathers in the land stand up to this menace, the better for the next generation. Who are these worship dealers? They are many of our brothers and sisters whose faces adorn fliers and posters in our conferences and meetings. They are the products of our churches. Sadly, many of them have turned their backs on God—blatantly violating the tenets of His word as ministers of Christ that they all claim to be. It is a generation populated by plenty of unsaved people and carnal worship dealers, all of whom have found a safe haven to market their singing skills to the highest bidder. It is not about the desire to advance the gospel of Christ, but to build image empires and global brands for themselves that will ultimately convert to financial gains for them.\nRoot Causes\nBut what is the root cause of this problem? The Church, our fathers, and society at large is responsible for this menace. Many of the “superstar” worship dealers that are grinding the noses of pastors on the ground in Nigeria with their “pay me my fees before I lead worship” practices were influenced by some of our fathers.\nMy conversation with worship leaders in Nigeria, coupled with my many years of experience in the Church, proves to me beyond all doubts that this menace has its roots firmly entrenched in the values and practices of many of our church leaders. Here are my findings from my research on this subject matter. Many of our church leaders publicly boast and brag about their global influence; they spread branches all across the globe and rake in funds in their billions on a regular basis; they come to the church on Sundays and speak glowingly about how much money they’ve got; they boast about the experience of their family and children in their last holidays to the Bahamas and to Hawaii; they revel in their acquisition of state-of-the-art automobiles and choice properties; they invite pastors from other parts of the world and pay them fortunes.\nAccording to my findings, these praise and worship leaders told me that aside from the sacrifices of these pastors, their own labor and sacrifices equally contribute to the growth of the church. They told me that as they sit in church every Sunday to listen to the mouth-watering financial success of the pastor and the church, they feel used and abandoned. “We’ve got families too,” they told me. “We studied music in school and hold music as our major calling in life.”\nConsequently, Satan hijacked the process and pushed these young, talented worship leaders to rebel against the system, “Me too will make money with my skills and talents, anyhow, anywhere.” And to make matters worse, when the pastor invites a “superstar” worship dealer with a large following to his convention with mouth-watering reception and a red carpet to match, the faithful worship leaders in the church become frustrated and influenced to toe the same path, “Me too must become a superstar,” “Me too must be received at the airport with a red carpet.” And then the cycle of desecration continues. Further to this is the role of our declining culture. Nigeria is a nation deeply rooted in the culture and value of greed and waste, ably promoted by corrupt politicians, impoverished population, and massive unemployment. These socio-economic factors, coupled with the role of the fathers, constantly sweeten the narrative, “There is no other means of paying my bills if I don’t charge fees prior to accepting invitations.” Second, these superstar worship dealers are instruments for pulling crowds to programs. So, the supply chain of ministries is fraught with compromised church leaders who eventually mentor and nurture compromised worship dealers. It’s a joint venture—bring crowd to my meetings, pay me my fees.\nRemedies\nIt is important for me to tell whoever cares to listen that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. Your present needs, my present bills, and our collective challenges do not and will never be the logical and rational excuse for desecrating the hallowed chambers of the church of Christ. You may not know, but what you’re doing is selling the grace of God on your life. It’s a very grievous sin against God.\nFor those churches in Nigeria that are actually founded on Satanic covenants, it is logical to desecrate and re-desecrate their altars with any method or practices available to the mind. But for every pastor or church leader who is standing for Christ, what we say in public and our practices in private must align with God’s ways of doing things. It is evil and satanic to charge to preach or to charge to lead worship within the church community.\nAyo Akerele is the senior pastor of Rhema Assembly and the founder of the Voice of the Watchmen Ministries in Ontario, Canada.

    "text": "VINC FORUM initiative launched at Innovate Vietnam 2024 VINC FORUM initiative launched at Innovate Vietnam 2024 The program was held at Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park on October 1 and 2 as part of the NIC's 5th anniversary and Innovate Vietnam 2024 celebrations. The National Innovation Center (NIC), under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, has partnered with the Vietnam University and College Innovation and Startup Network (VNEI) to launch the Vietnam Innovation Forum for Netzero and Climate Change Adaptation (VINC FORUM) initiative. This program aims to strengthen networking and exchange on innovation among universities, both domestic and international, as well as with enterprises, businesses, and policy makers. Hub Langstaff, Country Manager of the Swiss EP Program Vietnam, speaks at the conference. Photos: MPI | The program represents a significant milestone in VNEI's collaborative efforts and underscores the strong commitment of local and global universities and innovation organizations to address pressing challenges such as climate change, emissions reduction, and creating a sustainable future. Participants provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of innovation in higher education, as well as international perspectives on Vietnam's innovation landscape. Speaking at the seminar, Vu Quoc Huy, Director of NIC, emphasized the importance of innovation in the higher education system and its role in achieving the goal of building a prosperous nation. He expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the cooperation between domestic and foreign universities and NIC to train quality human resources. Hub Langstaff, Country Manager of the Swiss EP Program Vietnam, shared insights on Swiss innovation models, highlighted Vietnam's significant innovation potential, and offered recommendations to strengthen the local innovation ecosystem. Dr. Sarah Mamiese, Director of the AFD Campus, praised Vietnam's recent strides in innovation, particularly the establishment of the NIC as a symbol of successful innovation that reflects the nation's passionate commitment to progress. Tran Nam Tu, Deputy Director General of the Department of Science, Technology and Environment at the Ministry of Education and Training, suggested that the higher education system identify which institutions have the capacity to innovate and which have the potential but don't currently use it. He noted that innovation depends not only on individuals, but also on leadership and the entire system. \"This approach will provide a comprehensive view of innovation in Vietnamese universities and help refine effective policies,\" Tu stressed. The Deputy General Director announced that the Ministry of Education and Training plans to launch two initiatives, including \"Training Human Resources for High-Tech Development (2025-2035)\" and \"Developing High-Quality Human Resources for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" Tu added that these initiatives aim to build a strong workforce in high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, positioning Vietnam to attract investment from leading global tech firms. These efforts will support economic restructuring and sustainable development through science, technology, innovation, digital transformation, and green initiatives. An overview of the conference. | In addition, fostering a supportive work environment is critical to maximizing the potential of trained personnel and providing continuous learning opportunities, he said. During the seminar, the organizers announced the addition of 15 new members to the VNEI, bringing the total number of members to 71. The network was launched under the auspices of the NIC and the Ministry of Planning and Investment. Its goal is to foster collaboration among organizations that share the mission of supporting and promoting innovation and startups in universities and colleges. The network aims to implement innovative initiatives in education, research, technology transfer and overall capacity development of educational institutions.",

    "text": "El papa Francisco se reunió hoy con el presidente colombiano, [Gustavo Petro,](https://www.bluradio.com/mundo/presidente-gustavo-petro-ya-esta-en-el-vaticano-para-reunirse-con-el-papa-francisco-so35) \"Cuente conmigo, cualquier cosa me avisa\", se despidió el pontífice de Petro en la bilblioteca del palacio apostólico después de que el mandatario, como explicó después a los medios, propusiera que el Vaticano sea la sede de una ronda de negociaciones con el [ELN.](https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/cerac-reporta-el-incumplimiento-del-cese-al-fuego-por-parte-del-eln-acumula-19-actos-violentos-rg10) La reunión había comenzado con una broma, cuando el papa le pidió al presidente de Colombia que \"se pusiera elegante\" para posar en las fotos protocolarias de inicio de la audiencia. Después, durante el intercambio de regalos y la presentación de las delegaciones, Petro obsequió al papa con café colombiano y una ruana, prenda característica del altiplano de Cundinamarca y considerada un símbolo nacional. Publicidad Por su parte, Francisco regaló a Petro una escultura en bronce que representa dos manos que se unen y en el fondo una mujer con un niño y una nave de migrantes con la frase 'Llenemos las manos con otras manos'. Tras la reunión con el papa, la delegación colombiana, de la que también formaban parte el canciller, [Álvaro Leyva,](https://www.bluradio.com/mananas-blu/polemicas-declaraciones-del-canciller-alvaro-leyva-mananas-blu-diciembre-14-de-2023-pr30) \"Durante los cordiales coloquios en la Secretaría de Estado, se expresó satisfacción por las buenas relaciones entre Colombia y la Santa Sede, destacando la positiva colaboración entre la Iglesia y el Estado, con el fin de promover el diálogo, la justicia social y la reconciliación\", explicó el Vaticano en un comunicado. Publicidad También \"se abordaron los temas de la situación socio-política, del fenómeno de las migraciones y de la protección del medio ambiente en la región\". Por su parte, Petro explicó a los medios a su salida de la audiencia: \"Es posible que hagamos una ronda aquí (en el Vaticano), ya se hablará con el ELN. Pues parece que podamos construir un paso todavía mucho más profundo en la dejación de la violencia con un escenario como este, me parecería muy sugerente para toda la sociedad\". Y agregó que \"el papa está de acuerdo en que demos pasos más profundos en los Acuerdos de Paz\" El mandatario destacó que \"la Iglesia católica ha sido un gran apoyo en Colombia para todos los procesos de paz y lo es en este momento en relación al proceso de paz con el ELN\", de modo que ahora el Vaticano \"puede ser el escenario de una ronda de negociaciones\". Publicidad \"A mí me interesaría mucho que la siguiente (ronda) o la que pueda establecerse con el ELN se pueda desabrigar aquí por muchas razones que tienen que ver con la historia\", resaltó Petro en la plaza de San Pedro, dos semanas después de que el papa pidiera en el mismo lugar \"la liberación sin condiciones de todas las personas secuestradas\" en Colombia. Durante la conversación con Francisco, también salió a relucir el movimiento católico de la Comunidad de San Egidio, \"con gran experiencia en procesos de paz en Centroamérica, en África y en también en Colombia\" y que Petro visitó la víspera, aunque el presidente no desveló si formaría parte de esa negociación. Además de las negociaciones de paz, Petro señaló que también trataron la crisis climática y puso el ejemplo de algunas islas del Pacífico \"que se están hundiendo en este momento, se tienen que evacuar sus poblaciones ya prácticamente de urgencia\"; y hablaron asimismo de Nicaragua. Publicidad El presidente colombiano ya se había reunido con el pontífice en febrero de 2022, cuando era candidato presidencial, y también tuvo la oportunidad de encontrarse con él en 2015, durante un acto en Vaticano cuando era alcalde de Bogotá. Francisco viajó a Colombia en 2017, en un momento en que se celebraba el alto el fuego con la guerrilla del ELN y el acuerdo de paz con las Farc. Sobre una nueva invitación al papa a visitar Colombia, Petro afirmó: \"Primero tenemos que forjar aquí el escenario para la paz\".",

    "title": "Tariffs, Labor, Inflation: AI And Robotics Are No Longer Nice To Haves",
    "text": "Today’s advanced economies face significant pressure signals, as tariffs, trade tensions, energy volatility, labor shortages, immigration restrictions, declining birth rates and supply chain disruptions create a Gordian knot of challenges ahead. To prevent and offset these issues from spiraling, governments will need to dramatically improve efficiencies and cut red tape while businesses need to reduce costs and streamline processes wherever possible to stay competitive. The convergence of multiple crises demands scalable and transformative technological solutions. Key economic pressures—tariffs, energy volatility, supply chain disruption, rising interest rates, and labor shortages —each create ripple effects, making streamlined, cost-efficient operations essential. This means that technology is no longer a choice but an imperative, offering solutions that are sustainable, scalable, and practically deployable within the next 3-5 years. AI, robotics, and new energy solutions are promising they can tackle these issues, but can they deliver? They have to, it’s going to test the stability and success of businesses in this rapidly changing economic environment.\nThe Complex Knot of Global Economic Pressures To understand the urgency of technology’s role, we need to appreciate the interconnected nature of today’s economic challenges:\nTariffs and Trade Barriers : Tariffs are looking to be a major policy pillar among major economies, such as the U.S., China and the E.U. affecting all nations. On it’s own, it will likely increase costs for businesses and, ultimately, consumers. Industries that depend on international suppliers face higher expenses, and companies will need innovative ways to reduce dependency on long-haul, single trade routes. Electric Economy : The push for electrification across all sectors collides with rising oil and gas costs, adding pressure to industries reliant on affordable and consistent power sources. To achieve energy security and manage costs effectively, new energy technologies must meet both environmental and economic security goals. Supply Chain Disruptions : The post-pandemic period has exposed global supply chain vulnerabilities, with shortages of essential components like semiconductors slowing production. Companies are actively working to build resilient, flexible supply chain models to weather these disruptions. Interest Rates and Financial Pressures : As interest rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive, hindering growth and investments in capital-intensive projects, including critical technology and infrastructure improvements. Companies face rising costs and delayed projects due to limited access to affordable capital. Labor Shortages Due to Multiple Factors : Many of the advanced economies struggle with labor shortages in entry level and highly skilled sectors from agriculture to healthcare due to aging populations, declining birth rates, skills mismatch and tighter immigration policies. Automation is now an urgent requirement to compensate for the lack of available workers. Why Technology Must Step In—and Quickly\nAddressing these interconnected challenges requires a new technological paradigm. AI, robotics, new energy and storage solutions, and material science innovations must scale swiftly and practically across industries to keep the current population and to ensure the future state of the economy is more sustainable. These four areas are vital to businesses and to maintaining our quality of life:\n1. AI and Automation\nAI and robotics are no longer optional productivity boosters—they are going to be essential for business survival. By automating repetitive tasks, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture, robotics can fill labor gaps. AI-driven supply chain solutions provide resilience by predicting potential disruptions, identifying alternate suppliers, and ensuring continuous operations.\nWhat Time Is Netflix’s Live Jake Paul Vs. Mike Tyson Fight On Friday? Trump’s Cabinet: Here Are His Picks For Key Roles—RFK Jr, Doug Burgum, Matt Gaetz And More NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Friday, November 15th At the macro level, AI optimizes production schedules and logistics, adapting to fluctuating tariffs and supply chain shifts. The next wave of AI in logistics will adjust in real-time based on tariff rates, energy prices, and supply bottlenecks, ensuring that goods reach markets with maximum efficiency.\n2. Energy Innovation in an Electric Economy\nTraditional energy sources remain volatile and susceptible to geopolitical issues, driving the need for domestic production where feasible with clean energy generation and storage solutions. Advanced battery technologies and smart grids are crucial to making renewable energy sources viable. Affordable, durable, and recyclable batteries are essential for consistent power, allowing industries to harness renewable sources like solar and wind effectively. AI-driven energy management systems are also on the rise, capable of adaptively managing consumption to reduce costs and environmental impact.\nAdvances in cryptocurrency computer mining of fugitive energy sources, geothermal, nuclear, spaced based solar and even fusion energy are accelerating as businesses aim to secure reliable and sustainable power. However, the challenge lies in scaling these technologies quickly enough to meet current and future demands for electricity from consumer adoption of electric vehicles to scaling of AI data centers.\n3. Autonomous, Decentralized Supply Chains\nResilient supply chains have become essential rather than optional. Blockchain, IoT, and autonomous vehicles are foundational to building supply chains that are both agile and decentralized. Blockchain ensures traceable, transparent supply chains that adapt to geopolitical shifts and tariff changes.\nAutonomous vehicles, drones, and AI-enhanced warehousing systems minimize reliance on human labor, essential in light of restrictions and other labor shortages. With predictive analytics, these autonomous systems will enable companies to anticipate and navigate disruptions, ensuring timely delivery and reducing logistical dependencies.\n4. AI-Enhanced Workforce Solutions\nIn sectors facing acute labor shortages, industries will need to turn to technology to increase productivity. AI-enhanced training programs reskill workers, preparing them for in-demand roles, particularly in healthcare, technology, and engineering. AI is also being deployed in workforce management, allowing companies to optimize human resources and streamline workflows.\nRobotic process automation (RPA) reduces administrative burdens, allowing human workers to focus on complex, high-value tasks. In healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and robotic assistants will need to scale to alleviate workforce shortages while improving patient outcomes.\nScaling Technology for Practical, Widespread Use\nFor technology to effectively address these growing economic challenges, its scalability and practical applicability are paramount. Here are three essential considerations for ensuring the necessary widespread adoption of these innovations:\nAffordability for Small Businesses : Advanced technologies must be accessible not only to large corporations but also to small and medium enterprises. Open-source platforms, modular solutions, and cloud-based services help democratize technology, making it financially feasible for smaller organizations to adopt. Policy and Infrastructure Support : Governments have a critical role to play in fostering a supportive environment for technology adoption. By creating incentives, reducing regulatory barriers, and investing in key infrastructure, policymakers can accelerate the implementation of AI, robotics, and new energy solutions. Humans and Robot Skilled Workforce : Technology like automation and robotics can mitigate some labor shortages, but may not be able to close the widening gap. Skilled personnel are needed more than ever to manage, maintain, and innovate with these various tools. Businesses will need to simultaneously introduce automation and collaborative robotics while investing in training their staff to take on more complex tasks. Embracing a Necessary Technological Renaissance In the next five years, our ability to navigate the Gordian knot of tariffs, energy challenges, supply chain volatility, interest rates, and labor constraints will hinge on the successful deployment of scalable, transformative technologies. Businesses that plan ahead and embrace these advanced technologies will gain a substantial competitive edge. Without decisive technological interventions, the economic pressures binding global markets will tighten, jeopardizing economic resilience and growth. Embracing this transformation is and will be challenging.\nThe complexity of the global economy is increasing, and only those companies that adopt scalable, transformative technologies will be equipped to maintain efficiency and resilience. The race is already underway, and those who strategically integrate these technologies today will be best positioned to navigate tomorrow’s challenges.",
