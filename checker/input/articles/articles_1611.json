    "title": "Drama humanitario por los bombardeos israelíes lleva a miles en Líbano a huir del país o buscar refugio",
    "text": "Un verdadero drama humanitario se está viviendo en el Líbano tras las sucesivas jornada de ataques del ejército israelí contra el movimiento Hezbolá que están provocando no solo la migración masiva de miles de personas hacia Siria, sino también el desplazamiento interno de otros miles en busca de zonas que no se conviertan en objetivo militar. Los seis pasos fronterizos oficiales entre el Líbano y Siria se han abarrotado de largas filas de vehículos con personas que intentan huir de los bombardeos israelíes. De acuerdo con cifras de este jueves de la unidad de gestión de catástrofes, unos 16.000 libaneses y 15.600 sirios han cruzado en los últimos dos días con rumbo hacia zonas de la frontera. La historia se repite otra vez con la tragedia de miles de refugiados que huyen de los intensos ataques israelíes contra diversas regiones del Líbano, y que se aglomeran en el cruce fronterizo de Yeideh Yabus, el paso más directo entre Beirut y Damasco, donde se evocan las imágenes de la guerra de 2006. Es el drama de los miles de sirios que huyeron de la propia guerra civil en su territorio y ahora tienen que volver a buscar un lugar seguro en su país de origen. Más de medio millar de centros como escuelas y centros comunitarios acogen ya a 70.100 personas que en los últimos días han huido de una campaña de ataques israelíes sin precedentes, principalmente desde la región meridional. Es el caso de una anciana albergada en una escuela junto a su hija y dos de sus nietos. La mujer, que como casi todos prefiere no revelar su nombre, reconoce que no esperaba salir con vida del infierno que estalló en su aldea el pasado martes. “Antes solían bombardear un punto o dos, pero ahora son como bombardeos indiscriminados contra niños, contra civiles y casas por todas partes. Tenemos una vecina que está desaparecida, ¡toda su familia murió y ella aún está desaparecida!”, exclamó en declaraciones. “La destrucción es inimaginable”, sentenció. El testimonio corrobora los reclamos de la Organización de Naciones Unidas y de algunos países miembros de la comunidad internacional que reclaman a Israel por el elevado número de muertos civiles que sus operaciones están provocando, el mismo reclamo que se les hizo, y que fue desoído, a las fuerzas de Degensa de Israel en el conflicto en Gaza contra el movimiento palestino Hamás. Omar Yadalá, que gestiona una empresa de taxis que opera a ambos lados de la frontera, contó que ahora sus choferes “no pueden esperar largas horas en la cola” para entrar a Siria y por eso, “dejan a las familias en la calle para que gestionen sus asuntos en la frontera para poder regresar y traer otras tandas de personas del Líbano, donde un gran número espera la salvación”. Entre tanto, el refugiado Abas al Maula contó vía telefónica su historia de estas últimas horas, en las que llevó a su esposa e hijos de Baalbek, donde cayeron bombas israelíes, a Beirut, y ahora está llevando a su hermana y a su madre al puesto de control sirio. “Lo que vimos fue aterrador, familias enteras han sido asesinadas. Era una escena miserable”, añadió. Todo eso ocurre justo cuando el ejército israelí bombardeó por cuarto día consecutivo bastiones de Hezbolá tras realizar unos 115 ataques aéreos causando la muerte de al menos 92 personas y dejando unos 153 heridos en diferentes puntos del sur, el este y la capital del Líbano. Además, las autoridades informaron la muerte del jefe de la unidad de drones de milicia proiraní, Mohamed Srur, tras un ataque en un suburbio sur de Beirut. Por su parte, el ejército afirmó que este jueves unos 45 proyectiles fueron disparados contra territorio israelí desde Líbano, de los cuales algunos fueron interceptados y otros cayeron en zonas deshabitadas. Ante la escalada, que amenaza con arrastrar a toda la región a la guerra, Estados Unidos, Francia y otros aliados, incluidos países árabes, lanzaron un llamado conjunto para un alto el fuego de 21 días, a fin de “dar una oportunidad a la diplomacia”. Pero el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, declaró que sus tropas seguirán combatiendo a Hezbolá “con toda la fuerza necesaria”. La campaña de ataques de Israel ha dejado desde el lunes alrededor de 700 muertos, un número de víctimas sin precedentes desde la guerra civil libanesa (1975-1990). *Con AFP y Efe",

    "title": "Llegan las primeras cartas de despido a los investigadores María Zambrano que trabajan en Galicia",
    "text": "Los malos augurios se están empezando a cumplir. Los investigadores María Zambrano que fueron contratados en las universidades gallegas con cargo al programa de excelencia que había convocado el Ministerio de Ciencia , Educación y Universidades están empezando a recibir las cartas de despido . Sus contratos finalizan entre este mes y el próximo, en función de los casos, y no se ha ofrecido una alternativa para continuar en el sistema de investigación español, pese a que muchos de ellos renunciaron a puestos fijos en los centros de investigación del extranjero en los que trabajaban previamente antes de acogerse al programa de captación de talento para regresar a España. « Na última semana, a maioría de nós comenzamos a recibir as cartas de cese dos nosos contratos de traballos por parte da USC », aseguran en un comunicado. En la institución compostela están trabajando 15 científicos acogidos a este contrato, mientras que en la Universidade da Coruña (UDC) hay dos y en la de Vigo otros siete. Estos últimos son los que mejor lo tienen, porque la institución cuenta con un programa propio de retención del talento al que pueden acogerse los María Zambrano. En el conjunto de España se encuentran en esta misma situación más de 700 investigadores.\n« En Galicia, a Universidade de Vigo deu un paso adiante a través da implementación de novos contratos posdoutorais sensibles aos investigadores María Zambrano, máis esta iniciativa non se replicou ao conxunto das universidades galegas », lamentan los miembros del colectivo, que demandan la puesta en práctica de programas similares.\nEl talento retornado del extranjero se enfrenta a la incertidumbre: «Vamos camino al paro» r. romar\nOtra de sus propuestas es la extensión de sus trabajos hasta que puedan consolidarse en sus centros, de tal modo que tengan capacidad para captar fondos en programas competitivos a nivel nacional e internacional, de tal forma que con esta financiación puedan mantenerse ellos y sus equipos.\nEstos científicos llevan meses intentando encontrar una alternativa con las instituciones implicadas, pero de momento, y salvo excepciones, de forma infructuosa. El colectivo planteó sus demandas al Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades , el que hace tres años convocó el programa con fondos europeos para devolver a España el talento retornado, aunque sin ofrecer un compromiso real de continuidad a la finalización de los contratos. No obtuvieron ninguna « resposta oficial que permitise negociar coas nosas necesidades, reivindicacións e propostas ».\nEn Galicia también solicitaron reuniones con representantes de la Consellería de Educación, Ciencia , Universidades e Formación Profesional. Y la respuesta, según dicen, fue la misma: « o mesmo silencio institucional ». Simultáneamente también se mantuvieron conversaciones con las gerencias y vicerrectorías de sus respectivas universidades «sen que estes diálogos habilitaran espazos de negociación institucionalizados nos que poder tratar da nosa situación ».\nAnte esta situación, los científicos reclaman « con urxencia» un « diálogo aberto coa Xunta de Galicia , as tres universidades públicas e o Goberno de España para elaborar solucións mancomunadas que permitan a continuidade das nosas traxectorias investigadoras en beneficio do sistema universitario público ».",

    "title": "Mysterious morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy.\nThe FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels.\n“The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance.\nEven then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.”\nPeople are also reading…\nJon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms.\nAaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said.\nMany highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms.\nParker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels.\n“They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said.\nAccording to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked.\nThe North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported.\nMarian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.”\nHeather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi.\nMushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died.\nBefore the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.”\nThe FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert.\nThe study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication.\nThe study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms.\nHallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs.\nIn the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said.\nThere hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",
