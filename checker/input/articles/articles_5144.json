They were all straight to video films. Same with the Puppet Master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed this yet? Right, somehow you've stumbled across Ghoulies IV, probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this...Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? There is no need to review this film so critically. It is the fourth GHOULIES film! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because... it was 6.50.. I knew it wasn't Kubrick material. And I was right. An unremastered DVD with no extras, not even a trailer, boasts an uncared-for film.\nIt actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies film, Peter Liapis... who really didn't get many 'big' roles apart from those two films. And I don't see why... He's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun. But I guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the Ghoulies films, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco, who despite having a very small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), retains none of his acting ability... A complete idiot who's just awkward to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I don't need to look that up. She does look quite sexy, though her costume, her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility, which is no easy task for such a film.\nThen there is the Ghoulies themselves! Who also manage to let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, mistake no. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the Ghoulies are in fact KIDS in COSTUMES!!!! The filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers. Also, there's only TWO of them, and they're not the main highlight of the film, as they don't appear in a lot of it. However, at times they are MILDLY amusing... And they're not evil this time either.\nThis really is hilariously bad stuff, it's amazing that I was actually able to enjoy it. I dunno why... Some of the black humour is actually funny, though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you being that he will \"kill you, slowly...painfully...\".\nBut at least Full Moon had no involvement this time. Did they? Yeah, a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.\nYes, I watch crap. But not just any crap. Wynorski Crap!\nOkay, so I have a little thing for director Jim Wynorsky. Or at least I used to have, because it's been a while since I've seen a film of his. Wynorski must be one of my favorite bad-movie-makers ever. It's as simple as that. And \"Ghoulies IV\" really is one of the biggest stinkers of his I've ever seen. The only screen time the notorious Ghoulies have in this 4th installment is actually taken from footage out of the first movie. That's one thing you can say about Wynorski: He rips off whatever he can, even right down to his own movies (this not being the case for \"Ghoulies IV\", though - you have to see \"976-Evil II\" and \"Storm Trooper\" to understand this). But in this film we do have: Two extremely annoying and totally unfunny troll-midgets, a bunch of cheap & silly animated effects, a mysterious demon-summoning red diamond, bad acting, a retarded storyline that leads to nowhere, a drugstore shoot-out totally unrelated to the plot, yap yap yap and so on and so on... And best thing of all: Stacie Randall running around in a tight black latex suit with her boobies half exposed (all the time!). Great fun, but I have this slightest feeling that no-one is going to agree with me on that.\nRead more IMDb reviews",

    "text": "Dana White announces new multiyear partnership between UFC and Meta: “New fighter rankings system”\nJosh Evanoff- April 2, 2025\nUFC CEO Dana White has announced a new multiyear partnership with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.\nEarlier this year, the 55-year-old fight promoter suddenly joined Meta’s Board of Directors. At the time, there weren’t a lot of details about what, if anything, would be changing with Dana White joining the company. However, the two companies have now already signed a deal to work together. Earlier today, White took to social media to announce Meta’s new contract with the UFC.\nAccording to a press release issued following the video, the deal will see the tech giant “leverage its leading technologies to deliver unprecedented engagement with hundreds of millions of UFC fans.” In the aforementioned press release, Dana White and Mark Zuckerberg commented on the new partnership.\n“I’ve had a lot of great partners over the years that have helped us grow this sport, but Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans,” said UFC President and CEO Dana White in the statement. “Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level. We’ve already started to work on some innovations with Meta around a new fighter rankings system that I’ll be sharing soon. The next few years will be an absolute game changer for fans of this sport.”\nRELATED: HENRY CEJUDO CONTEMPLATING RETIREMENT FOLLOWING RECENT EYE INJURY: “I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH MY KIDS”\nThis new deal with\n[@meta]is going to be incredible for UFC fans[pic.twitter.com/hCAYed6q4m]— danawhite (@danawhite)\n[April 2, 2025]\nDana White announces major multiyear partnership between Meta and the UFC\n“I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways,” Mark Zuckerberg added in the statement, Founder and CEO at Meta.\nIn the video posted to social media, Dana White hinted at the use of Meta AI to overhaul UFC rankings. If that comes to fruition, it’s something that the promoter has wanted to do for a while now. Speaking in an interview with TNT Sports last October, White hinted at working with Meta to solve the rankings issue.\n“I could go on and on and on [about the UFC rankings] but I won’t,” Dana White stated last year. “We literally had meetings this week to work on it. I actually talked to Mark Zuckerberg, too, about AI, so yeah. I’m totally going to fix the rankings. We’re going to make a lot of strong moves here coming into 2025.”\nWhat do you make of these comments from Dana White and Mark Zuckerberg? What are your thoughts on the UFC’s new partnership with Meta?\nThis article appeared first on BJPENN.COM\nTopics:\nDana White\nUFC",

    "text": "Miracle in Wilmington: All 31 Trapped Workers Rescued After Dramatic Tunnel Collapse\nDiscover how over 100 LAFD heroes pulled off a miraculous rescue, saving 31 workers from a deep underground tunnel collapse in Wilmington, Los Angeles. Get the full story on this dramatic incident and the massive effort involved.\nMiracle in Wilmington: All 31 Trapped Workers Rescued After Dramatic Tunnel Collapse\nA massive sigh of relief swept across Los Angeles last night as all 31 workers trapped following a dramatic tunnel collapse in Wilmington were successfully rescued. The incident, which unfolded around 8 p.m. Wednesday, triggered a swift and extensive emergency response, culminating in a triumphant outcome with no injuries reported.\nThe harrowing ordeal saw construction workers brought to the surface in groups of eight, hoisted to safety by a crane operating at the bustling construction site. The efficiency and coordination of the rescue effort were nothing short of remarkable.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wasted no time in mobilizing city resources, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to commend the efforts. \"The City of Los Angeles has mobilized resources to the tunnel collapse in Wilmington,\" Mayor Bass wrote. \"More than 100 LAFD responders have been deployed, including Urban Search and Rescue teams. Thank you to all of those who are acting immediately to respond to this emergency.\" Her words underscored the gravity of the situation and the city's unwavering commitment to the trapped individuals.\nThe collapse occurred within the ambitious $630.5 million Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, a vital undertaking commissioned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. This critical infrastructure project, aimed at bolstering the region's wastewater management, has been under construction by prime contractor Flatiron Dragados. According to the company's website, the colossal tunnel stretches an impressive seven miles, boasts an approximate diameter of 18 feet, and lies a staggering 450 feet underground – a testament to the immense engineering challenges involved.\nWhile Flatiron Dragados reportedly aims for a 2027 completion, documents from the Los Angeles County Sanitation Department, dated July 2024 and obtained by CBS News, indicated that tunneling was originally slated for completion by this year. The discrepancy in timelines raises questions about potential delays or unforeseen complexities within the project.\nInitial reports from the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) on Wednesday night indicated that as many as 15 tunnel workers were isolated by the \"collapse\" near the intersection of W. Lomita Boulevard and S. Figueroa Street. The LAFD's rapid deployment of over 100 responders, including highly specialized Urban Search and Rescue team members trained in confined space tunnel rescues, proved instrumental in the successful operation.\nVideo footage from the scene painted a vivid picture of the massive emergency response, with flashing lights and a flurry of activity underscoring the urgency of the situation. While the exact cause and detailed dimensions of the tunnel at the point of collapse are still under investigation, the paramount concern was the safety of the workers, a mission that was flawlessly executed. This incident serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in large-scale infrastructure projects and the incredible bravery of the first responders who stand ready to face them.",

À Londres, à Brighton ou encore à Birmingham, même démonstration d’unité en réponse à la centaine de rassemblements d'extrême droite prévus mercredi 7 août. \"Je suis surpris de cette mobilisation, il y a du monde partout. On s’est rassemblé pour montrer qu’on est une ville unie\", déclare un manifestant.6 000 policiers antiémeutes déployésFace aux débordements prévus, 6 000 policiers antiémeutes ont été déployés, le plus important dispositif mis en place depuis plus de dix ans. Finalement, les manifestants anti-immigration ne se sont rassemblés qu’en petit nombre, comme à Portsmouth. Cette faible mobilisation peut aussi s'expliquer par les premières condamnations d’émeutiers, mercredi 7 août. Keir Starmer, Premier ministre, y voit une preuve de l’efficacité de sa réponse aux émeutes : \"Nous avons prouvé que le système de justice pénale fonctionne rapidement\", a-t-il déclaré. Le soir du jeudi 8 août, une vingtaine de rassemblements anti-immigration sont attendus.",

    "text": "Day 2: Work hit in tehsils as revenue staff on strike\nThe strike by revenue employees for the second consecutive day caused inconvenience to the general public as they could not get their work done at the registrar’s office here today. A large number of applicants who required one or the other certificate from the office remained a harried lot.\nRevenue officials across Punjab had gone on strike on Thursday, disrupting operations in tehsil and sub-tehsil offices after the arrest of tehsildar Sukhcharan Singh Channi, posted at Tapa in Barnala by the Vigilance Bureau on corruption charges. Claiming that Sukhcharan Singh Channi is an honest officer, his outraged colleagues went on strike.\nVikram Singh, a resident, who came to get a certificate from the department, said the revenue officials went on strike several times in the past in defence of their colleagues who had been arrested on corruption charges.\nThe office of the registrar at the tehsil complex wore a deserted look on Friday. Employees remained absent from their workstations. Apart from sale registration and mortgage deeds, various kinds of property-related works are handled by the registrar. Even the work of registering marriages, issuing domicile certificates and countersigning affidavits is done at the office.",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s third post-presidency book, [Save America](https://45books.com/collections/books-by-president-trump/products/save-america?variant=45465486033108), debuts on the New York Times [bestseller list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2024/09/22/hardcover-nonfiction/) this weekend, a shocker of sorts because of the newspaper’s effort to ignore the book, as well as the book’s $99 price tag. While it is just the latest [bestseller list](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/3134746/trump-new-book-save-america-surges-no-1/) to feature the [360-page large format book](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/3099342/new-trump-book-offers-peek-into-next-presidency/), it is clearly the most important for the New York real estate developer. “I just learned that my newest book, SAVE AMERICA, is a New York Times BEST SELLER! No other book takes you behind the scenes like this coffee table book. I picked each photo, and I can tell you it is FANTASTIC. Get your copy today at 45books.com,” he wrote on Truth Social. For the New York Times Sept. 22 list of hardcover nonfiction books, Trump’s opens at No. 11. Save America is similar to his two other post-presidency books that feature photos accompanied by his commentary. The first, [Our Journey Together](https://45books.com/collections/books/products/copy-of-our-journey-together-2023?variant=43455258984660), featured photos of his administration with comments on several. His second, [Letters to Trump](https://45books.com/collections/books/products/letters-to-trump?variant=43651757441236), was a collection of notes from celebrities, sports figures, and world politicians and his thoughts on each. His newest features key moments in his first administration to help lay out the foundation of his plans should he beat Vice President Kamala Harris in November, making the 45th president the 47th president. The cover is the iconic photo of Trump with his fist in the air, yelling, “Fight, fight, fight” after an assassin’s bullet clipped his right ear in July. “We are thrilled President Trump has made multiple bestseller lists, including the New York Times. Considering that his book is worth much more than any other book on the list, it’s an incredible accomplishment,” said Sergio Gor, CEO of [Winning Team Publishing](https://45books.com/), which he and Donald Trump Jr. created. [SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets) Its placement as No. 11 is surprising, considering that Save America is by far the most expensive book on all the New York Times lists, at $99. What’s more, the New York Times list does not include those sold through Trump’s publisher, with which the vast majority were preordered. Had the New York Times included all the direct sales, it is likely the book would have been the nation’s No. 1 bestseller, according to industry sources.",
