    "text": "A Day all about Mel Prideaux and the Community Religions Project\n- Date: Friday 6 December 2024, 10:30 – 15:30\n- Location: University of Leeds\n- Cost: Free\nOn the occasion of Mel leaving us soon, there will be a day of reflection and celebration focused on the Community Religions Project, which Mel has directed in recent years\nProfessor Melanie Prideaux has been a key member, shaper, and supporter of the Centre for Religion and Public Life (CRPL) over many, many years. Mel’s academic interests have spanned interfaith dialogue, Muslim-Christian relations, religion and public life, and fieldwork methodologies and practices. During her time at Leeds, she has been an inspirational educator, supervisor, and colleague, pioneering innovative teaching strategies and doing much to facilitate and nurture constructive and productive working relationships between students and academic staff, and between them and diverse religious communities in Leeds.\nOn the occasion of Mel leaving us soon, there will be a day of reflection and celebration focused on the Community Religions Project, which Mel has directed in recent years. Mel has made significant positive impact on CRPL and the School of Philosophy, Religion and History of Science and will be much missed. Please join us on 6 December 2024. Save the date (more details below and to follow).\nFrom Mel…\nThe Community Religions Project (CRP) has been a key dimension of my time at Leeds as both a student (MA and PhD) and an academic. The CRP has shaped my research and my teaching, and in the last ten years I have, to some extent, shaped it. As Director of the CRP, I have focussed on learning and teaching – with our website (completed in 2015 by Jo Henderson-Merrygold as part of a student internship) providing a showcase for student research and projects. As I leave the University, the time is right to consider both the legacy and the future of the CRP.\nThe CRP was formed in 1976, originally as an informal research group led by Michael Pye, Ursula King, and William Weaver. Kim Knott was the long-term Director of the CRP and is probably the noted academic most associated with its development. Her own research, and the modules which she developed, have left a lasting impact on the study of religion in Leeds. The original purpose of the CRP was, according to Pye:\n… to carry out and publish research into the religious communities of Leeds and neighbouring cities, and to relate such research to associated matters such as community relations, inter-religious understanding, religious education, and teaching programmes within the University.\nIn my 2008 PhD, [available here](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/531/), I noted that the CRP had led to my ‘inclination toward local, small scale, contemporary, ethnographic studies that are comfortable in interaction with theology and cognisant of the public policy debates surrounding ethnicity and religion’ (p.25). Our current PhD students and others in the Centre for Religion and Public Life (CRPL) are often adopting exactly this approach, and looking at the themes Pye suggests, though perhaps with less awareness of the ‘academic family tree’ which has made Leeds such a friendly space for such studies.\nThe extent of the research produced which has been actively associated with the CRP is visible in the range of subjects covered in the CRP monograph series (1984-1999), and in our archive of policy reports (1998-2016) which can be found in our research archive [https://crp.leeds.ac.uk/research-archive/](https://crp.leeds.ac.uk/research-archive/). Many more (and more recent) studies could doubtless be added to this archive – perhaps you might suggest some?\nChanges in the curriculum mean that once ‘core’ features of the TRS degree at Leeds (largely developed by Kim Knott) have changed. The Religious Mapping of Leeds was a Level 3 module which is still a model of authentic and engaged student research and assessment – with teams of students researching local communities and presenting their findings back to the local community. One of the most memorable was the Mapping of Chapeltown, where a senior police officer rather put the students on the spot by asking ‘So what should I do with this research?’. Of course, they replied with authority and enthusiasm! Religion in Modern Britain is a Level 1 module which is now optional but was originally compulsory – with all new Theology and Religious Studies students at Leeds required to undertake independent fieldwork in the locality. Many of our graduates (including current PhD students) remember this as a formative experience. I certainly remember the wonderful accounts including of a football match at Elland Road (‘Is football a religion?’). Indeed, for many years I would consider these reports one of my key ways of finding out what was happening in the religious life of Leeds!\nWhat next then for the CRP? This is the focus of our study day on December 6th. Between 10:30 am and 3:30 pm we will hear from academics, graduates and current PhD students as well, I’m very excited to say, from Kim Knott herself. We’ll hear about their research and their reflections on the CRP, and we will have some time in the afternoon to consider what the future of the CRP might look like, as I hand the directorship over into the capable hands of Emma Tomalin.\nIf you would like to attend, please email me ([m.j.prideaux@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:m.j.prideaux@leeds.ac.uk)) noting any dietary and access requirements, and I will send through the joining instructions and programme for the day.\nKnott, K.

    "text": "Tal y como estaba previsto, un verdadero festival de auroras boreales ha podido ser contemplado en gran parte de España esta madrugada, gracias a la potente actividad solar que ha desarrollado el Sol en las últimas horas. Este tipo de fenómenos, que ya tuvieron un episodio notable el pasado mes de mayo, han regresado a nuestro país esta noche, y han sido visibles desde Galicia hasta Baleares, pasando por Cataluña, el centro de la Península y, en realidad, casi toda España, según van comunicando diferentes observatorios astronómicos y aficionados a la fotografía, que han inmortalizado numerosas auroras de vistosos colores. Ávila, Ibiza, Cataluña, Vigo han sido algunos de los puntos desde se han podido fotografiar estas impactantes imágenes, que han teñido de colores rojizos y rosados el firmamento según avanzaba la noche. Se trata de un fenómeno inusual en nuestras latitudes, y más propias del norte de Europa, pero que son posibles gracias a la fuerte actividad del Sol que está registrándose estos meses. Una excepcional llamarada lanzada por el astro rey estos días ha sido la más potente de los últimos siete años, lo que ya presagiaba un nuevo episodio de auroras en latitudes tan bajas como la nuestra. Las auroras son provocadas por las partículas cargadas que llegan desde el Sol hasta la Tierra, donde interactúan con las capas altas de la atmósfera, iluminando el cielo. Los expertos auguran que las auroras aún podrán ser visibles durante alguna noche más en los cielos españoles.",

    "title": "Sui social il Natale inaspettato di Salah, calciatore musulmano",
    "text": "Decido di occuparmi di Mohamed Salah, attaccante del Liverpool e della nazionale di calcio egiziana, musulmano praticante al quale qualche anno fa un articolo su “La Repubblica” ( bit.ly/47hfEws) attribuiva il merito di aver mitigato l’islamofobia britannica, su suggerimento natalizio del collega e amico Lorenzo Galliani. Se lancio su Google “Salah Buon Natale”, in italiano, il robot cercatore mi restituisce poche righe sui siti dei quotidiani sportivi italiani, tutte più o meno di derivazione ANSA ( bit.ly/3H18kdY). Raccontano che Salah ha postato sui suoi plurivisualizzati account Instagram (63,3 milioni di follower bit.ly/3RWtD6E) , X (18,7 milioni) e Facebook (16 milioni) degli auguri di Natale non convenzionali, per un calciatore. Ha mostrato un abete addobbato ma in bianco e nero e ha scritto di avere «il cuore molto pesante» per «la brutale guerra in corso in Medio Oriente» e in particolare per «la morte e la distruzione a Gaza», e di «condividere il dolore di quelle famiglie che stanno piangendo la perdita dei loro cari», raccomandando di non «fare l’abitudine» alla loro sofferenza. Se interrogo Google con “Salah Merry Christmas”, in inglese, le righe e i link trovati sono molti di più e mi forniscono, oltre alla notizia, il suo contesto e il suo seguito. Il contesto è che da qualche anno Salah diffonde sui social un messaggio di auguri con immagini natalizie (la famiglia riunita sotto l’albero carico di addobbi). Il seguito è che anche quest’anno, come in passato, il suo post ha incontrato il biasimo digitale di una percentuale di persone (il 10% delle reazioni, secondo una fonte) che, dichiarandosi musulmane, gli ricordano: a chi appartiene alla nostra fede è vietato festeggiare il Natale, festa cristiana. E questo a prescindere dal riferimento alla guerra in corso in Medio Oriente, che pure domina il messaggio. Ma il tono e il contenuto del post sono quelli di un personaggio che, divenuto popolare grazie al calcio, sa di avere in pubblico un’autorevolezza tale da consentirgli di parlare d’altro oltre che di calcio, e di farlo con libertà: ieri condividendo, semplicemente, le tradizioni del paese in cui vive, e oggi schierandosi, nientemeno, con quella parte dell’opinione pubblica mondiale che rifiuta la guerra come metodo di risoluzione dei conflitti tra i popoli. © riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "Registran subida \"casi récord\" de temperaturas en la Antártida Las temperaturas del suelo en la Antártida Oriental se han disparado más de 28 ºC por encima de la norma en la segunda gran ola de calor que azota la región en los últimos dos años, informó el miércoles The Washington Post . La mencionada ola de calor se produce en pleno invierno antártico, por lo que las temperaturas todavía rondan los -20 ºC. No obstante, la anomalía térmica en el continente es la mayor del planeta, según los modelos meteorológicos. Se espera que las temperaturas se mantengan entre 20 y 30 grados por encima de la media en algunas zonas de la Antártida Oriental en los próximos diez días. Cabe señalar que han estado sustancialmente por encima de lo habitual durante la mayor parte del mes de julio, pero no tan altas como ahora. A modo de ejemplo, la semana pasada se situaron en 12 ºC por encima de la media. \"Esta ola de calor es un evento casi récord (o récord) para la región de la Antártida en la que está teniendo el mayor impacto. La gran huella de la ola de calor también es notable\", explicó Edward Blanchard, científico atmosférico de la Universidad de Washington, en un correo electrónico enviado al periódico.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",
