    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "title": "7 Ways To Revamp Your Resume For A Leadership Position",
    "text": "Popular\n7 Ways To Revamp Your Resume For A Leadership Position\nAre you a prime candidate for a mid-level or senior-level leadership role? If so, you have to shake up the way you tailor your resume for that position.\nThe way recruiters and hiring managers look for leadership candidates is a bit different than the way they search for candidates in other roles. They’re not just looking for technical skills. They want to see evidence of your ability to inspire teams, drive results, and lead through challenges.\nYour resume needs to tell a compelling story about your leadership journey, showcasing both your achievements and the impact you’ve made on organizations. Before you apply for that leadership position, make sure you leverage these seven strategies to tailor your resume for maximum impact.\n1. Revamp Your Resume's Keywords\nAs you may know, the computer databases, or applicant tracking systems, that store and analyze incoming resumes for job board, employer, and recruiter sites count the number of times certain words are used in your resume. These keywords are industry-specific and unique to each role in each company. Your resume ranks higher if you include more of these words in the document.\n- Include a keyword section in your summary and stock it with 12 to 15 keywords pulled from the job description of the role you are pursuing.\n- More importantly, use these keywords in each relevant job listing you include in your document. They can be easily woven into sentences in your position overview statements, as well as your achievements.\n- If you're a new grad, have recently attained an\nMBA, or don't have all of the experience sought in the job posting you're applying for, try listing relevant coursework in your resume's education section. This will boost your keyword count. - Fairly universal keywords include terms such as strategic planning, operations leadership, business management, cross-functional, cross-cultural, global, talent management, organizational restructuring, and P&L accountability.\n2. Reposition Your Resume's Summary\nBigstock\nEach time you apply for a new role, you need to tweak your summary to highlight the right skills and keywords relevant to the position. You also need to emphasize the right capabilities.\nWhen you apply for a leadership role, it is imperative to showcase your skills and experience with strategy creation. In lower-level jobs, you have to demonstrate your tactical execution strengths; in director-level plus positions, designing and implementing strategic plans is absolutely critical.\nInstead of writing a typical summary on your resume, change your top fold to an experience summary, which is a list of 6-8 hard or transferable skills needed for the specific job you're applying for.\nHere are some tips to make your experience summary stand out for a leadership position:\n- Tailor your skills: Identify the most critical skills for the leadership role you’re targeting by studying the job description and aligning your experience to those requirements.\n- Use industry-specific keywords: Incorporate terms commonly associated with leadership in your field, such as \"organizational transformation,\" \"team development,\" or \"market expansion.\"\n- Keep it concise: Each skill or experience point should be clear, impactful, and tailored to the role, avoiding unnecessary detail.\nA well-crafted experience summary gives hiring managers an immediate sense of your suitability for a leadership position and ensures you stand out as a candidate.\n3. Clarify The Context Of Each Position, Promotion, Or Achievement\nBigstock\nOne of a resume's key tasks is to tell the story of your career. Yours must convey the importance and relevance of each position change you've made while simultaneously clarifying the key challenges you faced in the role.\n- Include a brief position overview or introduction to each role on your resume. If the position was a promotion or special assignment, make that clear.\n- Showcase the context of your hire or promotion. Were you the first salesperson in a new territory, or the newest manager in a series of five within a short time frame? Were you hired or promoted with specific challenges in mind? Were you hired or promoted based on specific skills or experience you possessed?\n- If you were placed in the role to resolve specific challenges, it's vital to note the circumstances of your entry into the position. For example, if you were hired to turn around declining sales, what was the sales level when you started? What sales level or position did you attain during your tenure?\n- Keep it brief. Your position introduction should take up only two to three lines of text. Make every word count!\n- Do the same thing with your achievements by including key details that reveal the larger context of your actions. If you averted a division closure by turning around sales, that's vital to highlight. If your marketing efforts helped open new market sectors that paved the way for a mission-critical merger, say so. Use numbers to quantify these achievements. Don't just focus on results; put your results in a larger context that makes your overall contributions more clear.\n4. Front-Load Your Resume’s Achievements With A Strategic Focus\nBigstock\nMost job seekers assume that recruiters read resumes the same way that they do. However, that's not the case.\nMany recruiters read a resume \"out of order\" (aka in pieces and parts) to see the big picture of the prospective candidate's career. This often includes reading achievement statements differently than you do.\nBefore reading them in their entirety, some recruiters briefly review the first few words of each bulleted statement to test the waters, so to speak. They also do this to see if the accomplishments are more tactically or strategically focused. It's imperative that you front-load your achievements with the strategic focus they're looking for, assuming you have that experience.\n- In leadership positions, your strategy influence is often a bigger deal than your monetary impact. Begin your bulleted statements by clarifying your strategic impact, then note the specific impacts you achieved.\n- For example, here's a typical \"homemade\" bullet written by a real job seeker: \"Working on a green field project that would double the capacity of the plant.\" Here's a revamp that shifts the emphasis to strategy: \"Road mapped Greenfield plant start-up from strategic planning to on-time, on-budget rollout in 1 year. Outcome: Doubled throughput and increased revenue by $42M.\"\n5. Align Your Education & Extra Sections With A Leadership Focus\nBigstock\nIt's always vital to include up-to-date listings of your educational credentials, including certifications, relevant affiliations, and professional development coursework. However, you shouldn't overlook other details that can bolster the leadership focus of your resume.\n- Any evidence of your present or past leadership experience may be relevant. So, consider adding present or past\nvolunteer leadership rolesin professional or community organizations. - Make sure you include any for-profit or not-for-profit board or committee roles you have fulfilled. If space permits, include key initiatives you have contributed to during your tenure on these boards or committees.\n- Leadership courses completed at major grad schools deserve emphasis as well.\n- When you list industry-specific certifications, include them in acronym form as well as spelled out because either form is a keyword.\n- If you have won leadership awards or been selected for leadership development programs with any of your employers, make sure you note these.\n6. Use The Job’s Title As Your Resume’s Title\nBigstock\nThis is a quick change but a critical one: make sure you insert the exact title of the position you're pursuing into your resume as its title. This will add more keywords to your resume, and, more importantly, it will shape the perception of your resume's readers to see you as qualified for the position you are targeting.\nNow, this won't work if you apply for a leadership role for which you have few qualifications. However, if you are well-qualified for the position you're targeting and meet 75% or more of the role requirements, then this is a wise and appropriate thing to do.\n7. Harness Your Personal Brand In A Tagline\nBigstockWhether you call it a tagline or personal branding statement, these single-line headlines are the perfect length to encapsulate the problem you solve for employers. These kinds of statements are big-picture by nature, so they encompass the whole of your career rather than just your most recent role.\n- Highlight your leadership value: Craft a statement that emphasizes your ability to drive results, inspire teams, or implement transformative strategies. For example, \"Empowering cross-functional teams to achieve record-breaking growth through innovation and strategic planning.\"\n- Showcase your unique approach: Use the branding statement to reflect your leadership style or the specific value you bring, such as \"Transforming underperforming departments into high-performing units through data-driven decision-making and motivational leadership.\"\n- Align with the target role: Tailor your branding statement to the leadership position you're seeking by aligning it with the company’s mission or industry needs, like \"Driving sustainable growth and operational excellence in fast-paced technology environments.\"\n- Incorporate quantifiable achievements: If space permits, include a standout metric to demonstrate impact, such as \"Proven leader with a track record of delivering 30% year-over-year revenue growth through innovative market strategies.\"\nAll of the foregoing are content shifts you need to make in your resume to properly position yourself as a leadership candidate. In addition, consider overhauling your resume's “look and feel\" to call attention to executive-level experience. Use a clean, professional design with consistent formatting to exude sophistication and clarity. Incorporate subtle elements, such as bold section headers and plenty of white space, to emphasize key achievements without overwhelming the content. Finally, ensure your resume aligns with your personal brand and reflects the qualities you bring to a leadership role.\nIf you're looking to land a leadership role, we can help!\nBecome a member today and learn how to earn more, stress less, and truly love what you do.\nHow To Explain Wanting To Step Down From A Leadership Role ›7 Ways To Stand Out As A Leader At Work - Work It Daily | Where ... ›Moving Up: How To Transition Into A Leadership Role - Work It Daily ... ›6 Simple Ways To Position Yourself For A Promotion - Work It Daily | Where Careers Go To Grow ›3 Tips To Improve Your Executive Resume - Work It Daily ›",

    "text": "Christmas wishes continue to be granted for Waco students thanks to program created by dearly departed coach Mike Chapman\nWACO, Texas (KWTX) - Shopping is underway as hundreds of Christmas wishes are being granted for students in need as a program continues for the 16th year and fourth year after losing its founder, beloved University Head Soccer Coach Mike Chapman.\nThe Make A Wish Come True program is poised this year to be a huge success.\n“This year, between all four elementary schools, we will be sponsoring 300 students,” Dylan Chapman said.\nDylan is the head baseball coach at University High School and nephew of Mike Chapman.\nHe, along with family, supporters and friends, knew they wanted to keep Mike’s passion project going following his shocking death from a heart attack in 2020.\nMike saw a need in 2008 to help struggling kids at Christmas time and started the project by granting a few wishes.\nWith the help of the school’s Junior ROTC program and First Sgt. Leonard Montelongo, Make a Wish Come True has grown bigger very year.\nThe wishes are primarily granted for students at Alta Vista Elementary School, Bell’s Hill Elementary School, South Waco Elementary School and Kendrick Elementary School.\nThe students write a short essay in response to the question, “What would you do with 100 dollars.”\n“Most kid would write you’d think for toys and their Santa wish lists but you’d be surprised how many letters of kids we get asking for blankets, jackets, coats, money so that the heat can be turned back on , things that truly touch your heart,” Dylan said.\nDylan says the elementary gifts have all been sponsored, with the Bowen Family Foundation, founded by Waco native and singer Wade Bowen, taking care of the wishes of two entire elementary schools as they’ve done several years in the past.\nThe Baylor Business School sponsors one other elementary with Bird-Kultgen Ford sponsoring Alta Vista.\nDylan says that organizers are now focused on gathering gift cards for older students at Cesar Chavez Middle School and University High School.\n“What we still need right now is either cash donations or gift card donations to like Walmart, Target, or HEB in $25 increments that we can use to sponsor our middle school and high school kids so we can sponsor their Christmas wishes, too,” Dylan said.\nIf you’d like to donate a gift card you can deliver to University High School.\nIf you’d like to help in any other way you can contact Dylan by emailing him at [Dylan.Chapman@wacoisd.org](mailto:Dylan.Chapman@wacoisd.org) or Kyle Chapman at [Kyle.Chapman@wacoisd.org](mailto:Kyle.Chapman@wacoisd.org).\nCopyright 2024 KWTX.
