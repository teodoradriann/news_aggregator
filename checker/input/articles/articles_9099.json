    "title": "Should You Buy Enbridge Stock for its 7.65% Yield?",
    "text": "Pipeline\nMost investors are aware of how lucrative an investment option Enbridge (TSX:ENB) is. More specifically, most investors are aware of Enbridgeâs juicy dividend. But is that enough? Should you buy Enbridge stock for its insane yield?\nLetâs try to answer that question.\nFirst, an introduction As I mentioned, most investors are aware of what Enbridge does. That being said, prospective investors may not realize how connected the energy infrastructure behemoth is to different segments of the market.\nEnbridge is best known for its lucrative pipeline network, and thereâs a good reason for that. The company hauls massive amounts of crude and natural gas along its vast pipeline network. That network, which happens to be the largest and most complex system on the planet, generates the bulk of the companyâs revenue.\nIn terms of volume, Enbridge transports one-third of North American-produced crude. The company also hauls nearly one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by the United States. Suffice it to say, thereâs a massive moat around Enbridgeâs core business, making it a great investment option.\nBut thatâs not all the company does.\nEnbridge also operates a growing renewable energy business. The company has invested over $8 billion into the segment over the past two decades. Today, the segment comprises over 40 renewable energy facilities located across Europe and North America.\nCollectively, those facilities (which include solar, wind and geothermal elements) have a net generating capacity of over 2,300 megawatts. Thatâs enough to power over 1.1 million homes.\nBeyond renewables, Enbridge also operates the largest natural gas utility in North America. The utility business serves nearly seven million customers, hauling 9.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day.\nIn other words, Enbridge is a massive energy infrastructure company that offers a massive defensive moat.\nEnbridge offers a juicy income One of the primary reasons why investors continue to flock to Enbridge is for the massive dividend that the company offers. As of the time of writing, the yield on Enbridgeâs quarterly dividend works out to an insane 7.65%. That handily makes it one of the best-paying dividends on the market.\nProspective investors who drop $40,000 into Enbridge (as part of a larger, well-diversified portfolio) can expect to generate an income of over $3,000 in just the first year.\nThe reason I say first year is because Enbridge has an established history of providing annual upticks to that dividend for three decades. Enbridge has also planned to continue that tradition over the next several years.\nAnd keep in mind that investors who arenât ready to draw on that income can choose to reinvest it until needed. This allows any eventual income to grow further.\nShould you buy Enbridge stock for its yield? Investors should never consider a stock solely on its yield. Fortunately, in the case of Enbridge, the company has much more to offer investors than a shiny 7.65% yield.\nEnbridge offers a wide defensive moat and significant growth appeal across multiple segments in addition to that juicy yield.\nIn my opinion, Enbridge is a great long-term investment that should be a core holding in any well-diversified portfolio.\nShould You Invest $1,000 In Enbridge? Before you consider Enbridge, you’ll want to hear this.\nOur market-beating analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best starter stocks for investors to buy in 2024… and Enbridge wasn’t on the list.\nThe online investing service they’ve run for nearly a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor Canada, is beating the TSX by 32 percentage points.

In this captivating work, Herrick draws on his extensive real-world experience, crafting a story that transcends the traditional boundaries of the genre. Readers will be transported into the life of veteran Border Patrol Agent Kelly Smith, a character navigating not only the complexities of border security but also the profound emotions of love, loss, and sacrifice. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a glorious and militarized plan to breach the U.S./Mexican border—a threat unlike any seen before. As Kelly Smith confronts this challenge alongside his partner and best friend, Ruben Garcia, and the new love of his life, Cristina Chavez, the trio becomes embroiled in a web of power, corruption, and a ruthless foe. Herrick’s storytelling beautifully weaves action, suspense, romance, and humour, offering readers a unique perspective from a real-life Border Agent who has witnessed the harsh realities of the frontlines. Herrick, known for his deep insights into border and security operations, brilliantly captures the potential flashpoints of a disturbing reality should the situation at the U.S./Mexico border remain unchecked. The novel not only entertains but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to protecting our borders. “War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire” goes beyond the action-packed narrative, addressing themes of love and loss on the frontlines, shedding light on the personal toll borne by individuals committed to border security. The novel is a testament to Herrick’s creative imagination, offering an insider’s peek into events that feel all too real. Readers are invited to immerse themselves in this compelling narrative, experiencing the highs and lows of a life dedicated to securing our borders. “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” is now available for purchase at major retailers and online platforms. About the Author Jim Herrick is a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol. He recently completed a tour in Afghanistan as a contractor for the Department of State/CBP as a mentor to Afghan Border and Customs Police advising on border security operations. He has a “Secret” security clearance and has been actively involved in a broad spectrum of border and security operations including anti-terrorism, tracking and surveillance, weapons and canine handling, and the investigation and apprehension of aliens and contraband that enter the U.S. illegally. Jim’s acquired knowledge and experience give him keen insights into the possible scenarios that can occur when you put powerful, callous, and violent drug cartels together with corrupt foreign military powers and governments, a permissive, and ineffectual Mexican buffer, and a weak U.S. border. His creative imagination gives us an insider’s peek into major events that are just waiting to happen, often based on real people and events that have “almost” happened. Still active as a border and security consultant, Jim now lives in New Mexico with his family.

    "title": "Hundreds of Workers Strongly Stand in Strike at Boston Hotels Amid Wage Disputes, Including Marriott-Owned W Boston",
    "text": "In Boston, about 400 hotel workers commenced a three-day strike on Thursday, a continuation of the hospitality sector’s ongoing efforts for improved wages and staffing levels. This strike involves personnel from The Dagny Boston, Moxy Boston Downtown, The Newbury Boston, and Marriott’s W Boston. These actions are unfolding against the backdrop of broader negotiations and reflect a nationwide pattern of labor strikes within the industry.\nThis strike, represented by Unite Here Local 26, marks a significant escalation following an initial strike that commenced over Labor Day weekend, involving workers from other hotels. According to union officials, this current strike is scheduled to conclude at 11 p.m. on Saturday.\nThis labor unrest is part of a larger wave of strikes that has seen thousands of hospitality workers across the country walking off their jobs this summer. The workers are protesting against intense workloads and wages that have not proportionately matched the rising cost of living.\nThe recent strike at Boston hotels, including the Marriott-owned W Boston, saw hundreds of workers take a determined stand, voicing their demands for better wages and working conditions. Amid escalating wage disputes, these workers, united in their cause, highlight the growing tension between hospitality staff and management in urban centers. This labor action is part of a broader movement in the hospitality industry, where employees are increasingly advocating for wages that align with the rising cost of living and for staffing levels that allow them to maintain quality service without being overburdened. The strike at W Boston and other hotels not only underscores the workers’ resolve but also brings to light the pressing issues faced by hospitality workers in today’s economic landscape.\nThe series of strikes began intensively on September 1, when approximately 10,000 hotel workers from nine cities nationwide abandoned their posts. In Boston, around 900 workers demonstrated outside major hotels like Hilton Park Plaza and Fairmont Copley Plaza, significantly disrupting operations during the busy Labor Day weekend.\nIn response to the strikes, some hotels have had to modify service offerings, including limiting housekeeping services to on-request only. Guests have reported disruptions due to noise from picketing workers during early and late hours, which has impacted their stay experience.\nMarriott has responded by stating that The W Boston Hotel will continue operations, emphasizing that they have established protocols to manage the hotel effectively and ensure guest care during the strike.\nAs workers and chanting protesters continue to rally for “fair pay,” the tension underscores a critical moment for the hospitality industry in Boston and across the nation.",

    "title": "Venezuela to hold military exercises as British warship heads to Guyana | South Wales Argus",
    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.

El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#53](c53#c-53) ridiculizarlo si quieres.... Pero con Israel tenemos todo tipo de relaciones y bien estrechas, vamos de aliados, van de ser occidente, medio entran en europa, sobre todo socialmente, democracia plena etc etc ... No tiene absolutamente nada que ver.\nEsto es una masacre genocida por supuesto, ejem\n[#2](c2#c-2) .... Pro no es comparable. Si acaso, comparable a la masacre de Hamas.\n[#61](c61#c-61) Con Israel si, con Gaza no, mediáticamente deberíamos estar recibiendo un bombardeo de lavado de cara de Israel, pero es al contrario. Lo que esté bien o mal no me meto, no soy experto, pero la actitud de los medios ha cambiado y eso me inquieta.\nEs como si dentro de un mes encontramos todos los medios diciendo que Aznar ha sido el peor presidente, que hipotecó a España para décadas. Sería inquietante, llevan décadas lavándole la cara a Aznar y que cambien de rumbo significaría que algo ha pasado o que está habiendo algún cambio de poderes de influencia.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",
