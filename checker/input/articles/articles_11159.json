    "title": "AgTech to highlight 2024 Canada’s Farm Show - SaskToday.ca",
    "text": "REGINA - AgTech is being billed as a particular focus for the 2024 edition of Canada’s Farm Show, which is back in Regina on June 18 to 20. The annual show brings together farmers and ag industry professionals to see and display the latest in innovation and cutting edge technology for the agricultural sector. The launch event was held Thursday at Mosaic Stadium highlighting the new and returning features at this year’s show coming to Viterra International Trade Centre. Here is a look at what to expect this year: This year’s focus is on AgTech. According to show officials, this is where traditional farming meets technology, spotlighting the latest advancements shaping the future of farming. Returning will be Cultivator’s 24 Hour Start Up|AgTech. According to their news release this will bring together the best and brightest in agriculture, technology, and business to pitch ideas, form teams, and build a minimum viable product in just 24 hours. The Global AgTech Summit will include a one-day session, featuring industry guests and experts sharing insights into ag tech and innovation. The Premier’s Breakfast is back on the first day of the Farm Show June 18, with Premier Scott Moe set to deliver the State of Agriculture in Saskatchewan address. This event in organized in partnership with Regina and District Chamber of Commerce. One aspect of the Premier’s Breakfast will be presentation of the 2024 Innovation Awards sponsored by Farms.com and Greenwave Innovations. According to the Farm Show’s news release, those awards will be selected by a panel of judges with a practical understanding of how productivity on farms can be improved through innovation. The Launch Pad presented by Deloitte will be the showcase for innovation at the show, and feature a wide and diverse variety of speakers. A particular highlight on the first day June 18 is what is being billed as the exclusive Canadian introduction by Degelman Industries of their next line of high-performance tillage equipment: the HDSR Series of Heavy Duty Staggered Ripper. A sneak preview video of that reveal was shown at the launch event Thursday, along with their marketing slogan “Let ‘er Rip”. According to the company, this new product will address a definite need in the field. “We were looking at compaction issues in the US primarily, and looking at that we just noticed there wasn’t a lot of good products for guys that would fit a Degelman moulded product — not engineered tough enough, not durable enough,” said Derek Molnar, Marketing Manager with Degelman Industries. “We started looking at options we could put into a deep tillage system and that’s when we started looking at our HDSR Series of staggered rippers. And in those conversations with customers and farmers in the US, we started to notice a lot of tendencies that we’re seeing up in western Canada as well when it came to compaction. So as we developed that product, we’ve gotten more and more interest from western Canadian farmers for it, and what better time to introduce it to western Canada than one of the premier farm shows at Canada’s Farm Show in Regina.” Plenty of other exhibitors will be returning the Farm Show to showcase their products, and to further those efforts a new event is being launched on Wednesday, June 19 called the Exhibitor Reception. This is likely to become a regular feature of the show, and will replace the PBR Bull Riding event which was staged coinciding with the Farm Show the last two years. For those looking for jobs in the agriculture sector, the 2024 show also will include Launch your Career Agto recruit people into ag careers. A career fair is being hosted on the Thursday of the event in partnership with the Agricultural Manufacturers of Canada; students will be given complimentary entrance to the show that day. Once again, Viterra will be title sponsor for Canada’s Farm Show. The launch event included dignitaries such as Mayor Sandra Masters and Saskatchewan Minister of Agriculture David Marit. Marit has frequently attended the Farm Show and he told a story to the audience about a line his brother would use to describe it: the “ooh-aah party.” “We’d go up there and go ‘ooh,’ look at that, ‘aah,’” said Marit. In speaking to reporters, he pointed to the importance of the Farm Show in highlighting the innovation and ag technology going on in Saskatchewan. “What you’re seeing is technology and innovation that comes through the show by inventors here in the province, the new technologies like zero till, minimum till. You saw the launch today of a new apparatus by Degelman Industries as well. That’s the kind of innovation and technology that’s leading ag not only here in Saskatchewan, not only in western Canada, but really in North America and around the world. That’s why it’s important for the Farm Show and the respect it has by the ag industry as a whole. I mean, that’s why farmers come to see what’s going on, they want to see the new innovation, new technology and it’s really changing fast.” Roberta Engel, Acting President and CEO of REAL, has recently taken over that role following the departure of Tim Reid. With the multitude of changes and turmoil within REAL over in the past year there were questions raised about whether regular events at REAL might be impacted, but Engel maintains there was never a question that Canada’s Farm Show would go ahead. “Not at all. As I said earlier today, agriculture is extremely important to our province to our city and to our organization and it’s really the pillar of REAL,” said Engel. “And so based on that there was no question in our mind as an organization, that Canada’s Farm Show is here to stay. It’s a pillar, and we will continue to deliver on an amazing show.” With the launch event marks the official start of ticket sales for the Farm show. Single day passes of $15 plus taxes and fees are available, as are three-day pass for $30 plus taxes and fees. Guests under 17 are admitted free.

    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - The long dry stretch hit day 25 on Halloween. Although it’s perfect for trick or treaters, now SGA soils are abnormally dry according to the latest Drought Monitor released on Thursday. Not only very dry but very warm as temperatures remain about 10-15° above average. Definitely not feeling like fall with highs in the low-mid 80s and lows low-mid 60s.\nA front has entered the region with a line of moderate to heavy rain. It’ll make little progress eastward meaning still no rain for SGA. Rain stays away through the weekend into early week. Meantime the unseasonably warm air pushes highs toward record readings. Election Day likely the warmest with Albany near or possibly tying it’s record high of 87° set in 2003.\nMidweek another front slides east with rain chances returning. Also watching the tropics for possible tropical development in the Gulf of Mexico. Some models are suggesting a push of tropical moisture into the southeast late week. Too early to determine if that’ll pan out but we’re watching. Hurricane season officially ends November 30th.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction? Let us know.

    "title": "Noah Cyrus 'Loyal' to Billy Ray After 'Hard' Divorce: Source (Exclusive)",
    "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus were divorced in 2022 after nearly 30 years of marriage By Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis is a staff writer on the music team at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2019, and her work has previously appeared in Entertainment Weekly and the New York Daily News. People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 29, 2024 05:30PM EST Trending Videos Close this video player Noah Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus. Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus’s 2022 divorce was difficult on their family — but he still has the support of his youngest daughter. A source tells PEOPLE that Noah Cyrus, 24, has stuck by her dad’s side, even amid apparent strained relationships within the Cyrus family. “Noah is very loyal to Billy Ray,” the source says. “She and Billy Ray have always had a really close relationship.” Billy Ray, 62, filed for divorce from Tish, 56, in April 2022 after more than 28 years of marriage. The former couple — who have each since remarried — share daughters Brandi, 36, Miley, 31, and Noah and sons Trace, 35, and Braison, 29. (Billy Ray also has son Christopher Cody, 31, from a previous relationship.) “It hasn’t been easy for any of the kids,” the insider adds of the divorce. “Their parents’ separation was really hard, but it was also long overdue.” At the time of their separation, a representative for the family issued a joint statement to PEOPLE exclusively on behalf of Tish and Billy Ray, saying, \"It is after 30 years, five amazing children and a lifetime of memories, we have decided to go our separate ways — not with sadness, but with love in our hearts. We have grown up together, raised a family we can be so proud of, and it is now time to create our own paths.\" Billy Ray Cyrus Says a Photo Is Worth '1,000 Words' as He Poses with Wife Firerose and Dolly Parton Tish Cyrus, Braison Cyrus, Noah Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, Brandi Cyrus and Miley Cyrus in 2015. John Shearer/Getty The statement continued: \"We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents. We have not come to this decision lightly or quickly but with so much going on in the world, we wanted to provide some clarity and closure, so we can remain focused on what is important. With Love and Hope… Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus.\" Noah and Billy Ray previously teamed up in 2022 for a song on Noah's debut album The Hardest Part. The emotional track chronicled Noah's recovery from addiction — and when Billy Ray shared the song on his Instagram, Noah responded with a sweet message. \"The honor is mine daddy!!! so grateful to share this track I wrote about you, pappy and papaw Cyrus .. you're my hero and inspiration .. I love u ❤️,\" she wrote. While the Cyrus clan has not publicly commented on any familial strife, seemingly only Miley, Brandi and Trace were in attendance when Tish married Prison Break actor Dominic Purcell last August. On the day of the wedding, Noah shared a photo to her Instagram Story that featured her wearing a Billy Ray T-shirt while at a café with Braison. Then on Feb. 4, Tish and Brandi accompanied Miley to the Grammy Awards. When the “Flowers” singer won record of the year, she gave a pointed acceptance speech that made no mention of her dad Billy Ray, with whom she starred on Hannah Montana for five years.

Emma McIntyre/Getty Tish Cyrus Details Her ‘Complete Psychological Breakdown’ Before Divorce from Billy Ray Cyrus: ‘I Was Literally Terrified’ (Exclusive) Cyrus thanked “everyone that's standing on this stage right now, Tom, Tyler, Michael and Greg. Our teams, my team, Crush, Columbia, my mommy, my sister, my love, my main gays because look how good I look.\" She then asked the team behind her, \"Anyone else? Your wife, your fiancée, all the people that we love. Thank you all so much.\" \"I don't think I forgot anyone. But I might have forgotten underwear. Bye!\" she quipped as she concluded her speech. Billy Ray married Australian musician Firerose in October. Noah, meanwhile, announced her engagement to fashion designer Pinkus in June.",

    "title": "Sennheiser Accentum Plus review: Hard to complain",
    "text": "The entry-level and high-end Bluetooth headphone markets are pretty well saturated, with plenty of decent options under $100 and just as many premium headphones with price tags of $300 or higher. Not too many pairs in between catch our attention. But Sennheiser's Accentum Plus are an interesting option at what I'd call an upper-midrange price. More affordable than top-shelf offerings from the likes of Sony and Bose but still firmly in real money territory at a $230 MSRP, Sennheiser's latest don't quite hit the triumphant highs of the company's flagship offerings. But for anybody out for good audio and great battery life at a more realistic price point, the Accentum Plus headphones are well worth a look. Sennheiser Accentum Plus The Sennheiser Accentum Plus headphones have a lot to offer at a sub-flagship MSRP of $230. Audio quality is good, and battery life is great — but ANC is just okay, and the low-end response is lacking compared to Sennheiser's more expensive headphones. - Strong audio quality - Great battery life - Very comfortable - Middling ANC - Not as bassy as the Momentum 4 Wireless - Unintuitive controls Price, availability, and specifications Not top-shelf, but not cheap either The Sennheiser Accentum Plus aren't a flagship offering, but they're pretty expensive headphones. At $230, the Plus sit comfortably between the older $180 Accentum and the company's top-end Momentum 4 Wireless, which go for a steep $380 at retail. They're not hard to find: you can get the Accentum Plus at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy or direct from Sennheiser. Specifications - Battery Life - 50 hours (ANC on) - Bluetooth - 5.2 - Noise Cancellation - Yes - Microphones - 2 - Weight - 8 oz - Colors - Black, white - Audio codecs - SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX adaptive - Foldable - No - Charging type - USB-C - Multipoint - Yes - Battery charge time - 3.5 hours - Carrying case - Yes - Driver size - 37 mm What's good about the Sennheiser Accentum Plus? A lot, actually The Accentum Plus headphones aren't in the same league as Sennheiser's more premium offerings, and their sound reflects that. These headphones sound quite good, but they don't push the limits of Bluetooth audio the way Sennheiser's best options do. Still, I think Sennheiser's quite good is more than good enough for the segment the Accentum Plus are competing in. Sound comes across clear and spacious without any unusual compression or distracting ANC hiss. The Accentum Plus have handled everything I've thrown at them admirably: the bouncy lead guitar in Mac DeMarco's Cooking Up Something Good is sharp and defined, while the sub-bass on something like Legend Has It by Run the Jewels is nice and thick. The Accentum Plus don't offer the brain-shaking low-end response you can get out of the Momentum 4 Wireless, but boosting the bass in Sennheiser's Smart Control app helps. [ ](/sennheiser-momentum-4-wireless-review/) The Momentum 4’s Achilles heel could be a deal-breaker [ Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review: Awesome audio, average ANC ](/sennheiser-momentum-4-wireless-review/) True to form for Sennheiser, battery life is really great, too. The Accentum Plus can eke out about 50 hours on a charge with ANC active, enough to make it through an entire workweek and then some between charges. It takes a little over three hours to charge the headphones from zero to full, but Sennheiser says a 10-minute charge will net you about five hours of playback time. I also think the Accentum Plus are really comfortable. A lot of headphones, even pricier options like the Sony WH-1000XM5 , start to get uncomfortable after a couple of hours of wear, particularly where the band makes contact with the top of my head. Not so here: the Accentum Plus are comfortable enough to wear for entire workdays. What's bad about the Sennheiser Accentum Plus? ANC's only alright For the price, there's not much to complain about in the Sennheiser Accentum Plus. I think the biggest drawback is probably the headphones' unremarkable ANC; with noise cancelling on and music playing at medium volume, more external sound makes it to my ears than I'd expect. You'll need to turn your media up pretty loud to drown out nearby conversation. It's not bad, it's just not as strong as what I've come to expect from big-name over-ear headphones. I do think the headphones' controls are just a bit unintuitive. Sliding up and down adjusts volume, and sliding forward or back skips tracks in either direction. That's all simple enough, but enabling or disabling ANC is a swift double-tap on the right ear cup, which isn't quite as self-explanatory. There's also a single hardware button that controls three functions: calling up your digital assistant, power, and pairing. A single press opens your configured voice assistant, a long-press turns the headphones on or off, and a longer press activates pairing. You'll have it down in an afternoon, but it's not the most elegant setup. There's also no IP rating, so you don't have any assurance the headphones can survive drizzle or sweat. That's not unusual for headphones, even premium pairs — but it's still something to consider when you're spending hundreds of dollars. [ ](/best-wireless-headphones/) Good wireless headphones are an investment — here are all your best options [ Best wireless headphones in 2024 ](/best-wireless-headphones/) Should you buy the Sennheiser Accentum Plus? A good option for the price The Sennheiser Accentum Plus headphones strike a good balance between functionality and price. For an upper-midrange asking price of $230, the Accentum Plus offer strong audio quality, broad codec compatibility, and battery life that'll see you through days of heavy use between charges. They support multipoint connectivity, too, and they're plush and comfortable enough for hours of wear. Their ANC isn't very impressive and the controls are a little annoying, but if you're looking to spend about 200 bucks on a new pair of headphones, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus are a good option without many major drawbacks.

Audio quality is good and battery life is great — but ANC is just okay, and the low-end response is lacking compared to Sennheiser's more expensive headphones.",
