    "text": "La société haïtienne Caribbean Port Services (CPS) a annoncé jeudi qu'elle fermait l'accès terrestre à son port de la capitale Port-au-Prince, un corridor clé pour les approvisionnements dans le pays et qui a été paralysé par des attaques de gangs armés. \"La CPS fermera ses barrières à tout type de trafic terrestre du 26 au 29 septembre\", a indiqué la CPS dans un communiqué, précisant que cela devrait permettre à l'armée et à la police nationale de poursuivre leurs efforts pour sécuriser la zone.\nUn responsable des transports maritimes a déclaré cette semaine à Reuters que des tirs étaient dirigés contre les navires, les empêchant d'accoster et de décharger les conteneurs, tandis que les autorités ont signalé l'enlèvement de deux membres d'équipage philippins d'un navire de charge dans le port.\nLes dirigeants haïtiens qui se sont exprimés cette semaine devant l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies ont mis en garde contre l'aggravation de l'insécurité malgré le déploiement partiel d'une force de sécurité soutenue par l'ONU, dont le mandat initial expire dans moins d'une semaine.\nDe puissants gangs, armés d'armes provenant en grande partie des États-Unis, se sont unis dans la capitale au sein d'une alliance commune et contrôlent désormais la majeure partie de la ville et s'étendent aux zones avoisinantes.\nPlus de 700 000 personnes ont été déplacées à l'intérieur du pays, soit près du double du chiffre d'il y a six mois. Beaucoup d'entre elles résident dans des camps de fortune, dans des écoles, et n'ont pas de source de revenus fixe alors que la nourriture devient de plus en plus chère et que les taux de famine montent en flèche.\nLes principaux ports maritimes et l'aéroport international d'Haïti ont été fermés pendant près de trois mois au début de l'année, alors que la violence atteignait son paroxysme à la fin du mois de février, lors d'une flambée qui a vu des milliers de personnes sortir de prison et le dernier premier ministre démissionner.",

    "text": "Middle school shows support for military children PHILADELPHIA, New York (WWNY) - It’s Purple Up For Military Kids, a day to wear purple to show support for military children. Indian River Middle School, home to many students whose parents are Fort Drum soldiers, took part in the observance on Thursday. Sixth grader Chris Tsogbe is the son of a soldier, so he knows a thing or two about frequent moves with his parents. “I have moved four times in my life, and I had to restart my life here making new friends,” he said. Students and staff wore purple shirts to celebrate the children who face unique experiences with a parent or parents serving in the military. “I hope they feel supported. I hope they feel how much we care about them. I hope they understand they’re a member of our community whether they are here for one year, two months, a week, or three years or the rest of their careers. I hope they understand they have a home here at Indian River Middle School,” said Principal Angela Green. The Children’s Home of Jefferson County provided the shirts to students and staff of Indian River Middle School. Purple represents all branches of the military and unifies everyone for Purple Up Day. “It’s really hard to be a military child and I hope people know the struggle of being one,” said Tsogbe. The Indian River Central School District works in co-operation with Fort Drum to provide [military family resources](https://www.ircsd.org/en-US/military-family-resources-0e01e186).

    "text": "A Storm Track 7 Yellow ALERT DAY is in effect through noon as a clipper system brings heavy snowfall and a wintry mix to much of the viewing area. The morning commute will be slow and slick with delays possible. Today [WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY Until Noon]: Snow and sleet has been falling across the area early this morning with rain further south of Highway 30. The radar continues to fill in this morning with pockets of heavier rates at times. There is a wider batch of thundershowers/thundersnow producing heavy precipitation rates moving in from the west that should reach us through the morning commute. The rate of snow will overcome the warm ground and treated roads and accumulate, slowing things down and leading to slick travel. Give yourself a lot of extra time this morning and drive safe and slow. Check for school delays. While putting together a snowfall map has proven difficult for this system, I am expecting 2-5” to fall along Highway 20 with 1-3” to the north of Highway 18 and a trace to 3” from Highway 30 to I-80. The wintry mix ends by noon with mostly cloudy skies and highs in the mid to upper 30s. Winds are northerly at 10 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. Tonight: Clouds decrease as skies become mostly clear. Lows fall to the mid teens to mid 20s, the coldest air where the snow is deepest. Winds are light from the north at 5 to 10 mph. Saturday: This is the day to get out and run any errands. Clouds are on the increase but it will be dry with highs in the mid 30s to low 40s. Winds are light from the east at 5 to 10 mph. A Storm Track 7 Yellow ALERT DAY has been issued for Sunday as a dynamic system could bring significant snow to areas north of Highway 20. Sunday and Next Week: Light snow chances build in Saturday night, but the main surge of moisture moves in mid to late morning on Sunday, beginning as snow with cooler temperatures. We’ll have a very powerful southeast wind, which will gradually warm us throughout the day, to about the low 40s by midnight. Therefore, we will see a transition from snow to rain taking place from south to north as the day goes on. Before the complete change over, we may see some accumulations, possibly more significant than today, in our far northern counties. Temperatures warm with mostly rain expected Sunday night. Rain is likely with some thunderstorms possible for Monday with highs up to the 50s. Then, rain and snow is likely Monday night with snow ending Tuesday morning as temperatures crash. Winds are very strong with this system. I hope the rest of your day is a breeze! - Brandon",

    "text": "The message from the large group of protesters in front of the Warren office of the U.S. Rep. John James Wednesday afternoon was keep your hands off Medicaid.\nThe rally was organized by SEIU Healthcare union and included other advocate partners including Michigan AFL-CIO, Detroit Action, and Michigan United. James (R-Shelby Twp.) has supported the Republican budget resolution that could cut $880 billion from Medicaid.\nMany attendees had personal experience with Medicaid and emphasized the wide array of services it provides, particularly long-term care for disabled, elderly, and mentally-impaired people.\nHome care workers from SEIU healthcare workers union were joined by others protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid in front of U.S. Rep. John James’ Warren office.(PHOTO BY SUSAN SMILEY) Kaitlyn Williams has a three-year-old son who is disabled and requires a prescription formula that she said would cost $400 a month out of pocket if Medicaid was not available to her.\n“He has had six surgeries, he has a shunt, he has a G-tube so it is more than just the formula, too,” Williams said as she stood on Van Dyke Avenue with a sign stating that Medicaid saves lives.\nFor retired auto worker Ted Scancella, Medicaid represents long-term nursing home care for his mother, who died a couple of years ago.\n“My mom was in a nursing home facility toward the end of her life and that was partially covered by Medicaid,” said Scancella. “It doesn’t affect me personally right now, but it could in the future.\n“They keep clawing away at everything so you never know.”\nKatrina Manetta, who co-chairs Macomb Defenders Rising, attended the rally she hopes will raise awareness of the variety of healthcare services that would not be available to citizens if not for Medicaid.\n“We are out here fighting to make sure that the community is protected,” said Manetta. “People are terrified of how they and their families will be impacted by the cuts.”\nManetta said many people may not realize the essential services for which Medicaid provides. Her mentally-disabled aunt relies on Medicaid for her long-term care and has spoken to many parents of disabled children who say they could not afford medical care for them without Medicaid.\nA rally in support of Medicaid held in front of U. S. Rep. John James’ Warren office was well attended with many people expressing anger over proposed cuts to the program.(PHOTO BY SUSAN SMILEY) She also said people with low income jobs that do not offer healthcare, particularly those who need multiple medications, also need Medicaid.\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat whose district stretches from southern Oakland to the Dearborn and Downriver area, was on hand and urged James to vote in support of Medicaid and against proposed cuts.\n“Prenatal care, mental health care, long-term care; there are so many essential services covered by Medicaid,” said Tlaib. “John James knows what he is doing, and I’m asking him to change his mind and not to cut Medicaid.”\nSEIU Deputy Trustee Gabby Jones-Casey said the lives of healthcare workers and the lives of citizens are on the line, so it is important to create awareness of the impact proposed cuts to Medicaid would have.\n“Medicaid covers a lot of things that people do not even think about,” said Jones-Casey. “It funds a lot of our rural hospitals, it almost completely funds home care, and it gives resources to a lot of the people who are the most vulnerable,” said Jones-Casey.\nJones-Casey said the need for home health care is growing and thus, so is the need for Medicaid.\n“We should actually be talking about expanding the program, because of how impactful, positive and important it is to our community,” said Jones-Casey. “We are going to be out here doing whatever it takes to protect Medicaid.”\nJames did not immediately respond to a Macomb Daily request for comment.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Beaufort County, South Carolina from 1901-2000 was 50.4. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Beaufort County, South Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Beaufort County, South Carolina history.",
