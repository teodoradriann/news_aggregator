    "text": "Tammy Richardson named Woman of the Year A lawyer and activist has been named Bermuda’s Woman of the Year. Tammy Richardson, who spoke during an event commemorating International Women’s Day yesterday, said she accepted the annual award to highlight the work that still needs to be done to address domestic abuse on the island. “I have always believed in the justice system as a harbinger for hope and it was quite daunting when I realised that’s not true for everyone, particularly those who are victims of domestic violence,” she said. “While our gains have only been incremental in this space, there still remains a lack of faith in the judicial process.” Ms Richardson, a partner at Appleby and the deputy chair of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, added that she would work towards ending domestic abuse in Bermuda “until the justice system is that harbinger for hope for our most vulnerable individuals”. The Women’s Resource Centre organised yesterday’s event, which took place in the Earl Cameron Theatre and was hosted by [2023 Woman of the Year](https://www.royalgazette.com/general/news/article/20230309/patrina-oconnor-paynter-named-woman-of-the-year/), Patrina “Power Girl” O’Connor-Paynter. Tickets were $35, and all proceeds went to WRC’s advocacy programme, which works to end discrimination against women in Bermuda. Attendees at the event included: Rena Lalgie, the Governor; David Burt, the Premier, and his wife, Kristen; Tinée Furbert, the Minister of Youth, Social Development and Seniors; PLP MPs Renée Ming and Lovitta Foggo; and Susan Jackson, the Shadow Minister for Youth, Social Development and Seniors. Female members of Bermuda’s uniformed services greeted commuters coming into Hamilton yesterday. Representatives from The Bermuda Police Service, the Department of Corrections, HM Customs, Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service and the Royal Bermuda Regiment held up banners for International Women’s Day near the Crow Lane roundabout. Inspector Karema Flood said some people had arrived at the roundabout at about 7am and planned to stay there until 9 to promote International Women’s Day. Five people were at the roundabout at about 7.30am. Charles Gosling, the Mayor of Hamilton, who opened the event, said its theme of [inspire inclusion](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) “encourages us to take personal, corporate and community responsibility to ensure that women are included in all social, business and political spaces”. During her speech, community organiser and entrepreneur Kristin White encouraged women to promote communities that create “inspiredinclusion”, rather than always “be inspiring”. She said: “When you’re in community, your joy, trauma and stories are shared if and when you choose and are not a way for someone to be inspired to include you, but in conversation and dialogue as part of the human experience of storytelling and connection.” Poet and activist Tiffany Paynter said that inclusion and positive change began within the individual. She explained: “If we can’t ask ourselves what we contributed to the problem we want to solve and answer back, we’re just Voldemort, leaving it up to children to write our happy endings.” Hazel Clark, talked about her journey from representing the United States in the 800 metre at the 2000 and 2008 Summer Olympics to becoming the Bermuda Tourism Authority’s director of global sales and business development. She urged women to “find your lane, run your race and bring another woman along with you”. “That is the only way you can truly be legendary, to enhance others with your talents, abilities and the platform you have been given,” she added. Juanae Crockwell, the WRC executive director, the day’s final speaker, said some women may view inspiring inclusion as “getting a promotion or pay increase, shattering a glass ceiling, being the first woman this or that, or being elected into Parliament”. “But for many women in Bermuda, it looks like access to adequate and affordable housing, being able to marry who you love, earning a living wage, having health insurance, childcare and affordable, nutritious food,” she added. “When you don’t have those basic necessities of life, it’s very hard to feel included in society.” Ms Crockwell said the day’s theme “is not just for activists, it is for all of us, even those of us who are tired.” More photos from yesterday’s event can be found [here](https://www.royalgazette.com/event/news/article/20240308/international-womens-day-4/). • To learn more about or donate to WRC, visit [wrcbermuda.com](https://www.wrcbermuda.com/).

    "text": "苹果公司于近期正式推出的 iPhone 16e，作为16系列的新成员，自上市以来就备受关注。这款 手机 不仅首发搭载了苹果首款自研5G基带芯片C1，还配备了8GB内存和苹果最新的A18芯片（尽管少了一颗GPU核心），在性能上表现出色。而更令人瞩目的是，iPhone 16e以4499元的起售价（国补价为3999元起）上市，成为支持Apple Intelligence功能的最低价机型，填补了iPhone SE系列下架后的市场空白。 然而，令人意想不到的是，这款手机在上市仅一个月的时间后，价格就出现了大幅下跌。据京东平台数据显示，目前消费者可以领取300元的优惠券，叠加国补后的价格仅为3699元起，比苹果官网便宜了整整800元。这一价格调整无疑为对价格敏感的苹果消费者带来了极大的吸引力。\niPhone 16e在配置上也不容小觑。它采用了6.1英寸的OLED刘海屏，虽然刷新率为60Hz，但显示效果依然出色。后置摄像头方面，它配备了一颗4800万像素的镜头，能够满足用户日常的拍摄需求。不过，需要注意的是，这款手机并不支持MagSafe配件。 苹果此次推出iPhone 16e，显然是为了让更多用户能够以较低的价格体验到Apple Intelligence等先进功能。这一策略不仅有助于提升苹果品牌在消费者心中的形象，还能够吸引更多潜在用户加入到苹果生态系统中来。 本文属于原创文章，如若转载，请注明来源： iPhone 16e上市后价格迅速调整，京东平台立减叠加国补仅需3699元起 https://news.zol.com.cn/968/9683753.html",

    "text": "Pay — how much compensation people receive for their work — is as much an emotional quantity as an economic one. Self worth, the perception of how others value you, whether society values what you do, somehow those are all mixed up with one’s ability to pay the mortgage or educate the kids. Not many people would work for free, but people do forego opportunities for more money if the work they are doing seems more meaningful. In my interview with Orice Williams Brown of the Government Accountability Office, she told me how, after obtaining her MBA, she first thought of working on Wall Street. Financial industry jobs were tight then. So she took what she figured would be a one or two-year job at GAO, an agency she’d never heard of until it showed up at a job fair. Thirty years later, she’s GAO’s chief operating officer. That job carries a decent salary, but I asked Brown, half jokingly, if she ever thought of the potential millions, even billions, she forewent by sticking with federal employment. She said she actually does ponder it from time to time. “But I think what I’ve gotten out of being a public servant, I have earned in many other, more meaningful ways.” And now, as everybody knows, federal employees will get that 5% pay raise, plus or minus depending on locality. It won’t change anyone’s lifestyle, but it helps keep up with inflation. I’m not watching the ball drop Sunday night from a $12,000 suite in Manhattan, and I bet you’re not either. How are agencies doing with efforts to improve human capital management? Federal News Network surveyed government HR leaders to find out. Download our new survey, sponsored by Workday, to discover more! For most Americans, pay rises reliably, if sometimes only incrementally, over time. But not for everybody. Farmers, for instance, often have incomes that yo-yo from year to year depending on yields and commodity prices. Salespeople have down years, so commissions fall. Sometimes, economic forces beyond an individual’s control force an income change. A factory closes, jobs dry up. Economies change. Whole cities thrive then collapse. That’s all of little solace, I imagine, to a small group of federal employees working in Thomson, Illinois. The village lies along the Mississippi River, the Illinois-Iowa dividing line. It’s closer to Cedar Rapids than to Chicago. It’s also home to a federal penitentiary. Correctional officers and other prison employees face the end of a two year period in which they received a 25% pay boost aimed at retaining them. Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters declined to renew the retention pay, so salaries will drop by an average of $16,000 come January 1. The penitentiary has a troubled history. A 19th century Gothic ruin, construction started in 1990 by Illinois. It was a state facility with chronic staffing shortages. The BOP acquired it in 2012, but not for housing Guantanamo Bay detainees, as envisioned by the Obama administration. Instead it became a maximum security prison — with what BOP calls a special management unit for really bad people. Inmate murders forced BOP to move the specially managed folks elsewhere. In March of this year, Thomson converted to a low security prison. AFGE Local 4070 President Jon Zumkehr says the prison was understaffed even with the retention pay. Now, he says, dozens more employees have vowed to leave. A BOP spokesman told me, in an email, the agency’s position is that the conversion to low security ended the conditions that required retention pay. In his public argument with Peters, Zumkehr mentioned other factors that he says mitigate in favor of keeping the retention pay. Thomson is “in the middle of nowhere,” making recruitment difficult. He says nearby factory and State of Illinois jobs pay better than the BOP, and that housing costs are high there. And, BOP has failed to add in programming and the physical space programming requires necessary for a minimum security prison. He says the agency acquired mobile-home type structures for Thomson to use for classes, but they wouldn’t fit through the gates and there’s no money to have them dropped in by helicopter. This all gets to the heart of federal recruitment and retention in general. It’s all about the mission. For Brown, the GAO’s mission of oversight, program improvement and stewardship of taxpayer dollars has sustained her for a career. Correctional officers, the good ones anyhow, see themselves as helping rehabilitate people. That’s why the programming space matters so much to Zumkehr. Read more: Agency Oversight “Our job is not to warehouse these inmates. Our job is to program them,” he said. In other words, the bureau has some work to do to engender a higher level of employee engagement in the reconstituted correctional facility. Maybe that will help retention. Still, I’m not sure there’s anything BOP management can do to lessen the sting of pulling back that retention pay. If a bunch of people leave, as Zumkehr predicts, wouldn’t that be proof the retention pay was still needed?
