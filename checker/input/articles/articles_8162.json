Last year, the largest overall fish was caught by 9-year-old Blain Stanford, who caught a trout weighing 0.9 pounds.\nThe event is free with no fishing license required, but participants should bring their own fishing gear if they have it, plus a supervising adult. As children catch fish, they will be registered for prizes at the weigh-in station at the pond.\nNacogdoches Fire and Rescue will also attend the event to grill sausages.\nAndrew Hodge's email is andrew.hodge@dailysentinel.com.\n{{description}}\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\nKeep it Clean.

A wrestling journalist recently spoke about Ava Raine, while criticizing her work with the company and calling her a nepotism hire.\nAva Raine is a fourth-generation WWE Superstar who followed in the footsteps of her father and joined the industry. Apart from a few matches, Raine hasn't yet been involved in a major storyline.\nSpeaking on Wrestling Observer Radio , Dave Meltzer spoke about Raine and said that she is a nepotism hire while discussing Cody Rhodes ' promo on Monday Night RAW. He also commented on her work with the promotion.\n\"You know what's funny? On RAW, you know, when Cody Rhodes was talking and [CM] Punk was going, you know, whatever he was, and Cody goes, all I ever did was folk style wrestling and I was a nepotism hire. And then I saw Ava [Raine] and was like, Nepotism hire, you know. At least Cody was a great athlete, you know what I mean. It's like Ava is just Dwayne [The Rock] Johnson's daughter., that's all... I mean she tried to be a wrestler and everything, but yeah.\" (From 1:13:05 to 1:13:45)\nView this post on Instagram Instagram Post",

    "text": "Imphal: A serving Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the\nIndian Army was rescued by the security forces, hours after he was kidnapped from his home by ‘unidentified elements’ in Manipur’s Thoubal district on Friday, officials said. A defence spokesman said that Naib Subedar Konsam Kheda Singh, a resident of Charangpat Mamang Leikai in Thoubal district, was abducted while on leave from his residence on Friday morning.\nArmy columns along with other security forces immediately launched a coordinated joint search operation, which led to the rescue of the JCO on Friday evening. The JCO is currently at the Waikhong police station in Thoubal district.\nThough the exact cause of the abduction is not known yet, media reports suggested that it was an extortion attempt as his family had received such threats in the past.\nBesides the coordinated search operation, checking of all vehicles plying on National Highway-102 (Imphal-Moreh) was conducted to locate the JCO.\nFurther investigation is underway. Since the outbreak of ethnic violence in Manipur in May last year, soldiers and security personnel, be they on leave or duty, or their relatives have been targeted for nefarious interests.\nOn February 27, the house of Amit Singh, Additional Superintendent of Police (Operations), Moirangthem, was attacked in Imphal. The attackers also abducted him and intimidated his family members by firing in the air, besides vandalising properties. The officer was later rescued due to the timely intervention by the security forces. (IANS)\nAlso Read:\nManipur: Indian Army Officer Kidnapped From Residence\nAlso Watch:",

    "text": "A patient’s mindset not only influences their experience and satisfaction level, but research indicates it can also impact their physical, mental, and emotional health. So how can members of the healthcare team influence the patient’s mindset in a meaningful way?\nMindset researcher Kari Leibowitz, PhD, has studied this topic extensively and is helping healthcare professionals embrace the healing potential of prescribing perspective. Dr. Leibowitz, a Stanford-trained PhD, was the lead author of a newly published paper on mindset training. She discusses that research, as well as practical ways healthcare professionals can prescribe mindset.\nAbout the Expert\nKari Leibowitz is a health psychologist with a PhD in psychology from Stanford University, where she conducted research at the Stanford Mind & Body Lab.
