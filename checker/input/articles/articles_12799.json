    "title": "Met Office issues severe weather warning for Gloucestershire as cold front heads to UK",
    "text": "A severe\nweather warning has been issued for much of Gloucestershire over the weekend as the weather takes a cold turn. The Met Office has sounded the alarm for strong winds from 11am on Saturday (December 30) to 3am on Sunday (New Year's Eve).\nThe strong winds come in the wake of\nStorm Gerrit which brought chaos to much of the UK. The cold front will move across England and Wales and will also bring some heavy rain, especially in parts of Wales.\nThere could be some disruption to\ntraffic and travel with delays on the roads and railway, as well as potential for air delays and ferry routes in the West Country. Power cuts and public transport delays are also possible during the warning times.\nREAD MORE:\nLive flood warnings in Gloucestershire with UK snow risk amid 2024 cold snap forecast\nREAD MORE:\nBBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood announces marriage\nThe\nMet Office chief forecaster said: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\"\nThe warning area covers the Forest of Dean, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and much of the Cotswolds. Newent, Tewkesbury and Stow-on-the-Wold area outside the yellow alert zone.\nThe worst of the rain is forecast to fall from around 6pm on Saturday through to 3am on Sunday. Wind gusts could be up to 42mph on the Saturday evening.\nThe forecast rain comes at a time when parts of the River Severn has been placed under a Flood Warning by the\nEnvironment Agency, meaning flooding is expected, act now. Lesser Flood Alerts are in place on the whole of the River Severn and River Wye.\nA severe weather warning has also been issued for rain in parts of Wales from 10am on Saturday to 6pm on Saturday, with the eastern edge not far from the Gloucestershire border. Heavy rainfall in rain often leads to increased flood risk in Gloucestershire.\nThe Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn “wet and windy” across the UK with a band of “intense rain” pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly “severe gales” in exposed spots.\nIn a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see “significant snow”, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. He said: “There’s a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we’ve seen over some recent days.\"\nWant our best stories with fewer ads and alerts when the biggest news stories drop?

    "text": "[Mercados](/seccion/mercados) Lectura 2:00 min Precio del dólar hoy 6 de junio de 2024: Peso cae con fuerza tras un anuncio de Morena El fuerte movimiento de depreciación se presentó inmediatamente después de que Ignacio Mier Velasco, integrante de Morena y coordinador de diputados del partido, adelantó que iniciativas de Reforma pendientes se discutirán en septiembre. El peso mexicano volvió a debilitarse el jueves afectado por el temores sobre cómo utilizarán Morena y sus aliados una posición de dominancia en el Congreso. Cuando parecía haberse estabilizado, la moneda registró otra importante pérdida. El fuerte movimiento de depreciación se presentó inmediatamente después de que Ignacio Mier Velasco, integrante de Morena y coordinador de diputados del partido, adelantó que iniciativas de Reforma pendientes se discutirán en septiembre. El tipo de cambio cerró la jornada en 17.8881 unidades por dólar. Frente al cierre de 17.5329 unidades de ayer, con datos oficiales del Banco de México (Banxico), perdió 35.52 centavos, que son equivalentes a una depreciación de 2.03 por ciento. El precio del dólar se movió tras la noticia a un máximo de 18.0123 pesos desde un nivel mínimo de 17.4459 pesos. El Índice Dólar (DXY), del Intercontinental Exchange, que mide al billete verde con seis referencias, perdía 0.14% a 104.12 puntos. \"El tipo de cambio tiene una reacción fuerte, después de que el diputado de Morena Ignacio Mier adelantó que en septiembre se votarán 18 reformas, como la del Poder Judicial\", dijo Juan Carlos Cruz, docente de la Escuela Bancaria y Comercial. Falsa calma y atención en la Fed Prácticamente toda la sesión el peso había mostrado una estabilidad que difiere del sentimiento observado en los mercados locales, después de que en el inicio de esta semana registraron el peor día de los activos mexicanos desde la pandemia. \"La divisa sigue mostrando volatilidad por los resultados de las elecciones, aunque cada vez más acotada\", afirmó Monex. \"Con ello, la atención de los operadores está regresando a las señales de lo que harán los principales bancos centrales\". El Banco Central Europeo (BCE) recortó hoy sus tasas de interés en 25 puntos base, reconociendo el progreso contra la alta inflación. La decisión pone más presión a la Reserva Federal (Fed) de cara su decisión monetaria la próxima semana. Mientras llega esa fecha, los inversionistas ponen atención en las cifras de empleo estadounidenses, que serán clave para el análisis de la Fed. Mañana se divulgará el reporte de nóminas no agrícolas, de elevada relevancia para esta decisión. jose.rivera@eleconomista.mx",

Mind you, he was 17 when Elma first went on Love Island. We need an age restriction of like 25 because that’s insane.”\nSorry Elma is 32 and Sammy is 23 - ain’t no way 😭😭😭\n— AJB🏾 (@Anutweeted)[#loveisland][#LoveIslandAllStars][pic.twitter.com/ss5wdk2T4t][January 29, 2025]\nBefore entering the villa, Sammy had hinted that a romance with Elma could be on the cards when asked about reuniting with familiar faces.\nSo Sammy is 23 and Elma is 32. That’s a BIG gap!\n— Abigail (@yesindede)[#LoveIslandAllStars][pic.twitter.com/w62GX0Y12b][January 29, 2025]\nAt 32, Elma is nine years older than 23-year-old Sammy.",

    "title": "Vinyl Sales in the UK Hit Their Highest Point Since 1990",
    "text": "In an astonishing revelation, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) has declared a successful 16th consecutive year of escalating sales, showcasing the resurgence of physical music formats. The BPI's latest report reveals that the vinyl market has experienced an impressive surge, skyrocketing at a rate more than four times faster, boasting an 11.7 per cent rise, amounting to 5.9 million units in 2023 according to [NME](https://www.nme.com/news/music/uk-vinyl-sales-2023-reach-highest-level-since-1990-3563676). Topping the charts as the best-selling album of the year is Taylor Swift's '1989 (Taylor's Version),' closely followed by The Rolling Stones' 'Hackney Diamonds.' According to the BPI's insightful analysis, this resurgence reflects a continuing demand for vinyl albums and other physical music releases, creating a thriving market on the high street. The report attributes this success to the popularity of independent record stores, with iconic shops like HMV leading the way, having reopened its flagship store on London's Oxford Street this year. Delving into the specifics, the report highlights that seven out of the top 10 vinyl LP sellers were releases from 2023, including Swift's 'Speak Now (Taylor's Version),' Blur's 'The Ballad Of Darren,' Lana Del Rey's 'Did You Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,' Lewis Capaldi's 'Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent,' and Kylie Minogue's 'Tension.' Notably, British artists played a significant role in fueling the vinyl growth, contributing to over 40 per cent of the 100 most-purchased vinyl LPs of 2023, with recent releases from The 1975, Depeche Mode, Gorillaz, and Maisie Peters leading the charge. Classic albums and re-issues also continued to captivate audiences in 2023, with top sellers including Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours,' Courteeners' 'St Jude,' De La Soul's '3 Feet High And Rising,' and Oasis' 'The Masterplan.' Dr. Jo Twist OBE, BPI Chief Executive, expressed optimism about the resilience of the UK music market, emphasizing that the revival of physical formats, especially vinyl, provides consumers with diverse choices to enjoy their favorite music. Interestingly, despite the dominance of streaming, the CD market displayed its smallest annual decline in nearly a decade in 2023, indicating a potential stabilization. As we eagerly await the final figures for vinyl LP, CD, and cassette sales in 2023, set to be disclosed by the BPI on January 3, 2024, it is clear that the music industry is experiencing a remarkable renaissance in physical formats, challenging the digital age narrative.",
