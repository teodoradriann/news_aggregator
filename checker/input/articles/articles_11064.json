    "text": "Colombia obtuvo préstamos por 3.800 millones de dólares en el mercado de capitales\nAunque es una buena noticia para financiar las obligaciones fiscales de 2025, expertos advierten por los altos intereses de esta deuda.\nNoticias RCN\n04:26 p. m.\nUnirse al canal de Whatsapp de Noticias RCN\nEl Gobierno colombiano logró una exitosa emisión de bonos en el mercado de capitales. Los inversionistas le prestaron al país 3.800 millones de dólares que servirán para financiar parte de los compromisos fiscales adquiridos por la nación.\nEn total fueron dos emisiones de bonos globales, ambas por 1.900 millones de dólares. El compromiso fue pagar la primera en el año 2030, mientras que la segunda quedó a 2035.\nEsta operación es un préstamo que hace el Gobierno a inversionistas internacionales sobre unas tasas de interés, con el objetivo de financiar el presupuesto de 2025.\nPreocupan los altos intereses de estos bonos\nPara los expertos, la buena noticia es que Colombia haya logrado conseguir ese dinero en el mercado internacional. Sin embargo, la preocupación radica en que los préstamos se hicieron en dólares y con tasas entre 7,5% y 8,7%.\nLo que llama la atención es que estas tasas impuestas por el mercado son mucho más altas que las que se venían aplicando, y son puestas usualmente a países con calificación de deuda mucho menor a la de Colombia.\nExpertos señalan que, en el futuro, la calificación crediticia de Colombia podría bajar.\nPor otro lado, aseguran que emitir más deuda en dólares podría significar más costos dentro de los años siguientes.\nAsí se consiguieron los bonos globales\nEl Ministerio de Hacienda informó que la transacción “contó con una porción de manejo de pasivos que mitiga el riesgo de refinanciamiento y contribuye a mejorar el perfil de la deuda externa”.\nAdemás, el ministro, Germán Ávila, exaltó que la demanda que atrajo estas operaciones demuestra el compromiso del Gobierno con la diversificación del portafolio de inversionistas internacionales y del manejo de las finanzas públicas del país.\nUnirse al canal de Whatsapp de Noticias RCN\nSíguenos en Google News",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "5 things to know for May 10: Gaza, Stormy Daniels, Health care cyberattack, Plane safety, Ukraine",
    "text": "CNN\nBy Alexandra Banner, CNN\n(CNN) — Relentless rainfall in Brazil has submerged entire neighborhoods and an airport runway, with more floods likely in the coming days. The severe weather has also downed most communications as crews search for more than 100 missing people.\nHere’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day .\n1. Gaza\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said President Joe Biden made a mistake after the US paused sending a shipment of bombs to Israel so that they would not be used in an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel would fight with its “fingernails” if necessary, Netanyahu said in response. The Israeli military added it has the weapons it needs for its missions in Gaza, including a Rafah invasion. But a halt in US weapons may “significantly impair” Israel’s ability to “achieve military objectives.” Meanwhile, new satellite imagery shows Palestinians have begun to flee Rafah’s tent cities in large numbers over the past 72 hours as the threat of a potential major Israeli assault looms.\n2. Stormy Daniels\nThe testimony of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, wrapped on Thursday after Trump’s lawyers continued their attack on her credibility . Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. Trump has denied the affair. At the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan denied two defense motions , one for a mistrial based on the argument that Daniels’ changed her story about the alleged encounter, and one seeking a modification on a gag order so the former president could talk publicly about Daniels.\n3. Health care cyberattack\nA cyberattack is disrupting clinical operations at a major health care nonprofit, forcing staff to divert ambulances from “several” hospitals . The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is causing issues with electronic health records, some phone systems and “various systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,” Ascension said Thursday. The incident follows other widespread hacks in recent months that have hobbled health care networks across the US. A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare caused billing disruptions at pharmacies nationwide and threatened to put some health providers out of business . Its parent company paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to protect patient data in that case.\n4. Plane safety\nThe Senate on Thursday passed a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill ahead of a key deadline today. The bill would renew authority for the FAA for the next five years and allocate billions of dollars to improve aviation safety , enhance protections for passengers and workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation seeks to address the nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring and strengthening consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays. On the heels of several airline safety mishaps, it would also implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. The House will next need to pass the legislation, which currently has broad bipartisan support.\n5. Ukraine\nWestern intelligence believes Russia is seeking to exploit what it sees as a “window of opportunity” to further step up air and ground attacks on Ukraine as the country awaits further US aid . This comes as Russia unleashed a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine this week. Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired more than 50 missiles and 20 drones, targeting its energy infrastructure. Ukraine’s largest power company said this was the fifth time Russia has attacked its facilities in the last six weeks. Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin presided over a choreographed Victory Day parade to display his military might. An estimated 9,000 personnel took part, including a thousand currently serving in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is back\nBut will Baby Lasagna or Nemo triumph?
