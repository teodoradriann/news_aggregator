    "title": "Why staying friends with your ex is rarely a good idea",
    "text": "Breakups are hard and so is cutting all contact with someone you once loved. A 2017 study sought to understand why so many people had the urge to stay friends with their exes. However, psychologists who have weighed in on the phenomenon don’t think it’s always a good idea.\nRelationships aren’t always easy, and going through a breakup can be one of the most difficult experiences of your life. The level of pain also depends on how long two people have been together and how deep their connection is. Hence, many choose to stay friends with their exes. The decision could be due to various reasons, but depending on why you still haven’t cut contact with your ex could determine how healthy or unhealthy that decision is.\nStudy explains urge to stay friends with our exes\nA 2017 study\npublished in the journal Personal Relationships states there are four reasons why we feel like staying friends with our ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. The four key motivations are – security, practicality, civility, and unresolved romantic desires.\nIt’s natural to feel secure with someone you have been very close to for an extended period. No one is closer to us than our partners. Despite the romantic relationship coming to an end after a breakup or divorce, the sense of emotional security remains. Psychologist Mark Travers\nnotes (via Forbes) that friendships born out of wanting to be there for one another during difficult times have a net positive impact on people’s lives.\nIt is also a positive when those who have kids together decide to remain friends as it’s practical to get along for the sake of the child. Travers also notes that it is important for exes to take time away from each other after a breakup. That time would be well spent reflecting on why the relationship didn’t work out and understand what you can improve in yourself. It is important to asses the red flags one might have neglected in their ex so they don’t end up with someone similar again.\nWhen it’s not a good idea to be friends with your ex\nIt’s mostly the latter two reasons – civility and unresolved romantic desires – that cause a massive issue. If someone’s friendship with their former romantic partner is based on a desire to be civil, the motivation may run out sooner or later.\nMORE FOCUS STORIES\nIt is also a terrible idea to remain friends while one of the two has romantic desires for the other. Dr. Gary W. Lewandowski Jr\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-psychology-relationships/202111/should-you-stay-friends-your-exes on Psychology Today that this can often lead to feeling heartbroken and jealous, and also lead to deteriorated mental health. It can also send you into a loop of being in an on-again-off-again relationship.\nHow friendships with exes affect future romantic relationships\nYou being in frequent contact with your ex via texts or meeting in person is a sign to your new partner that you aren’t entirely over them.\nIt can also make it seem like you are carrying a lot of baggage from your previous relationship, thus reducing your chances of building a new one. Dr. Travers asks people to answer some basic questions when in this situation:\n- How will your ex react to your current partner?\n- What questions will your new partner have about your ex and how you will respond?\n- How comfortable will it be if you have to introduce your ex to your new partner?\n- How will you feel about telling your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend about your new partner?",

    "title": "Trump claims he didn’t know his hateful rhetoric echoes Hitler",
    "text": "Donald Trump has centered his unlikely rise from reality television star to onetime — and potentially future — president on the idea that he’s wiser than Washington’s bumbling political class, once going so far as to label himself a “very stable genius.”\nBut when it comes to one of history’s darkest moments, Trump is professing ignorance.\nFacing criticism for repeatedly harnessing rhetoric once used by Adolf Hitler to argue that immigrants entering the U.S. illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country,” Trump insisted he had no idea that one of the world’s most reviled and infamous figures once used similar words. The Nazi dictator spoke of impure Jewish blood “poisoning” Aryan German blood to dehumanize Jews and justify the systemic murder of millions during the Holocaust.\n“I never knew that Hitler said it,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday, volunteering once again that he never read Hitler’s biographical manifesto, “Mein Kampf.”\n“I know nothing about Hitler,” he insisted. “I have no idea what Hitler said other than (what) I’ve seen on the news. And that’s a very, entirely different thing than what I’m saying.”\nTrump’s assertion that he knows so little about one of the 20th century’s most documented figures is notable for someone seeking the presidency, a role steeped in and shaped by history. But claiming ignorance, particularly when it comes to people who espouse racist or antisemitic rhetoric, is a tactic Trump has repeatedly deployed when aiming to distance himself from uncomfortable storylines.\nAfter he was endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke during his winning 2016 campaign, Trump insisted he had no knowledge of the white supremacist who had run for office numerous times and is described by the Anti-Defamation League as “perhaps America’s most well-known racist and anti-Semite.”\n“Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper in February 2016. “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.”\nAsked if he would condemn the white supremacists supporting him, Trump said he would “have to look at the group. I mean, I don’t know what group you’re talking about.” He continued to repeat that assertion even after Tapper said he was referring to the KKK.\nOTHER CASES\nTrump has also pleaded ignorance in other cases. As he ran for reelection in 2020, Trump said he didn’t know much about QAnon, the convoluted conspiracy that alleges Democrats are involved in a satanic pedophilia ring and casts Trump as the nation’s savior — even as he retweeted accounts promoting the conspiracy.\n“I know nothing about it,” he said during an NBC town hall. Nonetheless, he refused to rule it out as false. “I don’t know that and neither do you,” he said.\nIt was the same when Trump was asked to condemn the Proud Boys militia group, which was key in organizing the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Enrique Tarrio and other members of the far-right extremist group have been found guilty of seditious conspiracy and other crimes for their part in the attack, which was part of a desperate bid to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.\n“I don’t know who the Proud Boys are,” Trump told reporters after instructing the group, during a presidential debate, to “Stand back and stand by.”\n“I mean, you’ll have to give me a definition ‘cause I don’t really know who they are,” Trump said of the group, which was drawing headlines at the time.\nTrump has also suggested he was unaware of some of the most consequential periods of American history. At a recent rally in Reno, Nevada, Trump said he had to ask Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to define the post-Civil War era known as Reconstruction as he boasted about his growing popularity with Hispanic voters and Republican wins along the border.\n“They say the first time since Reconstruction. You know what Reconstruction means? That means the Civil War,” Trump told the audience. “I said, ‘Give me a definition, governor, of Reconstruction. You said I’m the first one to win all of these towns since Reconstruction.’ He said, ‘Well, Reconstruction: since the Civil War.’ That’s a long time ago. That’s pretty good.”\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump “has been very clear that he’s talking about criminals and terrorists who have crossed the border under Joe Biden’s watch. When he’s back in the White House, the United States will return to a secure border and a system that places the safety and security of Americans first.”\n‘THE MOST SAVAGE CRIME’\nThe former president’s claims about Hitler are particularly notable given his upbringing in New York, home to one of the nation’s largest Jewish populations.\nTrump has also participated in Holocaust memorial events. He spoke at a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2017, where he denounced Holocaust deniers as accomplices to “horrible evil.” And he paid a brief visit to Yad Vashem, Israel’s national Holocaust memorial, where he called the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews “the most savage crime against God and his children.”\nTrump’s insistence that he has not read “Mein Kampf” — an assertion he also made at an Iowa rally last week — evoked a different Hitler book he once allegedly had in his possession.\nJournalist Marie Brenner reported in Vanity Fair magazine in 1990 that Trump’s ex-wife, Ivana Trump, told her lawyer that, “from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, ‘My New Order,’ which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed.”\nTrump told Brenner that, “it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of ‘Mein Kampf,’ and he’s a Jew.” Davis confirmed to Brenner that he had indeed given Trump ”a book about Hitler,” but it was “My New Order, “ a collection of Hitler’s speeches. “I thought he would find it interesting,” Davis said, adding, “I am his friend, but I’m not Jewish.”\n“Later, Trump returned to this subject.,” Brenner wrote. “‘If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them,’” Brenner wrote.\nHISTORY\nKnowing basic American history is important for a president, said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history.\n“We don’t need a historian as president, but certainly you want a president with a feel for some of the basic parts of American history, of world history,” he said, noting, for instance, that Reconstruction was a “a formative moment for civil rights and race relations.”\nIn “Mein Kampf,” Hitler wrote that, “All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning.”\nTrump told Hewitt his message was “very different” and he had “zero” racist intent.\n“I’m not a student of Hitler. I never read his works,” he said. “They say that he said something about blood. He didn’t say it the way I said it, either, by the way. It’s a very different kind of a statement. What I’m saying when I talk about people coming into our country is they are destroying our country.”\nStill, he repeated “poisoning” references eight times.\nAmong those references: “They are poisoning our country. They are poisoning the blood of our country. They’re coming from all over the world. They’re coming from prisons. They’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re terrorists. Absolutely that’s poisoning our country. That’s poisoning the blood of our country. And that’s what’s happening.”\n ",

    "title": "Russia’s new threats to exiles: Seized assets and forced returns - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "In Bangkok this week, members of an antiwar Russian-language rock group were fighting deportation to Russia, detained in what supporters described as a cramped, hot, 80-person immigration holding cell.\nOn Wednesday in Moscow, the lower house of Parliament passed a law that will allow the Russian government to seize the property of Russians living abroad who, in the words of the legislature’s chair, “besmirch our country.”\nThe two developments, though thousands of miles apart, reflected the same grim calculus by the Kremlin: Using new legislation and apparent diplomatic pressure on other countries, it is turning the screws on Russia’s sprawling antiwar diaspora.\nAdvertisement\n“Historic Russia has risen up,” President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with backers of his presidential campaign on Wednesday, reprising his contention that the time has come to cleanse Russian society of pro-Western elements. “All this scum that’s always present in any society is being slowly, slowly washed away.”\nUnder the law, any Russian, even those in exile, found to be engaged in “crimes against national security” — including criticizing the invasion of Ukraine — could have their assets confiscated. Putin is expected to sign the law, though it is not yet clear how widely or aggressively the Kremlin plans to use it.\nBut the law’s quick passage — it sailed through the rubber-stamp State Duma unanimously — is another signal that the Kremlin, having stamped out dissent at home, is increasingly turning its attention to criticism from abroad. Hundreds of thousands of Russians fled after the war began, including many celebrities who can still reach their fans through platforms like YouTube, which remains accessible inside Russia.\nAmong the first to feel this increasing pressure are popular performers who have drawn large audiences in places popular with Russian émigrés like Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Southeast Asia. In recent weeks, Russian antiwar celebrities have accused Thailand and Indonesia of bending to Russian pressure to cancel their shows, while an antiwar rapper found himself banned from reentering the United Arab Emirates, his adopted home.\nAdvertisement\nThe most dramatic case unfolded after members of the rock group Bi-2, originally from Belarus and one of Russia’s most popular bands, were arrested in Thailand last week for an immigration violation. Their supporters said Russian officials spent days pushing Thailand to deport some of them to Russia, where the musicians could have faced prosecution for criticizing the war.\nBy Wednesday, the rockers had escaped that fate thanks to the intervention of Israeli and Australian diplomats, who arranged for all seven band members to be deported to Israel, according to the group’s lawyer, who requested anonymity for security reasons. (Four are citizens of Israel and one of Australia.)\nThe extent of the Kremlin’s efforts to get the rockers sent to Russia was not clear, but on Tuesday, the group said in a statement that Thai authorities had canceled an earlier plan to deport some of them to Israel after Russian diplomats visited the immigration center where they were being held.\nAnalysts and human rights advocates consider the case a stark demonstration of the Kremlin’s increasingly aggressive efforts to punish Russians speaking out against Putin abroad — especially when they do so in non-Western countries that are interested in maintaining good relations with Moscow.\n“This is a special operation,” said Dmitry Gudkov, an exiled Russian opposition politician who is close to Bi-2, referring to what he described as Russia’s efforts to get the band members sent to Russia. “Their task is to grab someone big outside the country to show that they can grab anyone, anywhere.”\nAdvertisement\nThe rock group’s brooding hits are part of the soundtrack of the early Putin era, and in later years, the group was rubbing shoulders with the Russian elite at marquee events — performing, for example, at Putin’s annual economic conference in St. Petersburg in 2019. But by last year, Bi-2’s lead singer, Igor Bortnik, was writing that Putin’s Russia evoked “only disgust and squeamishness.”\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry denied interfering in the Bi-2 case in Thailand, but it referred to the band members soon after their detention as “sponsors of terrorism.” A Russian lawmaker, Andrei Lugovoi, said the country was awaiting Bi-2’s deportation “with open arms” and predicted: “Soon they’ll be playing and singing on spoons and metal plates, tap dancing in front of their cellmates.”\nSome pro-Kremlin figures have started praising Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for getting more aggressive in putting pressure on antiwar Russians abroad.\n“The MFA has really gotten to work in this regard,” said Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst who appears frequently on Russian state television, during a phone interview. Russian diplomats, he added, have been “actively informing” foreign governments in recent months about Russians who have “gone over to the enemy’s side.”\nAlisher Morgenshtern, a rapper who had criticized the war and moved to Dubai, said last Friday that the United Arab Emirates had banned him from reentering the country. Ruslan Bely, an antiwar comedian, had two shows in Thailand canceled in January.\nAdvertisement\nAnother Russian comedian who opposes the war, Maksim Galkin, last week announced a show in Bali, Indonesia, days after Russian state media reported that his two planned shows in Thailand had been canceled.\nBut last weekend, Galkin told his 9 million Instagram followers that the Bali show, too, was canceled. Indonesian authorities, he wrote, had turned him away at the border and told him they were doing so at the request of the Russian government.\n“It’s funny,” Galkin wrote, that the Russian state was expending so much effort on “the maniacal persecution of dissenting artists abroad.”\nThe head of the Bali regional office of Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Romi Yudianto, said he was not familiar with Galkin’s case but that Indonesia “has its own sovereignty” and the right to reject unwanted visitors.\nBut Markov described the pressure on antiwar performers, as well as the new law allowing the confiscation of the property of Russians criticizing the war, as part and parcel of the same government effort.\n“This is a message to those who are against Putin,” but aren’t sure how loudly to voice their disapproval, Markov said. It is a reminder to them, he said, that if they do speak up, even outside Russia, “don’t think that you’ll be fine.”\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times .\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "NEET-UG 2025: Supreme Court Refuses To Transfer Plea From Delhi High Court Over Exam Conduct\nAnmol Kaur Bawa\n26 Jun 2025 3:07 PM IST\nThe Supreme Court today (June 26) refused to transfer to itself a writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the conduct of the NEET-UG 2025 exam. The Court observed that since the challenge was based on individual facts applicable to the petitioner himself, and not on any ground applicable generally across the board, the High Court was the appropriate forum to decide.\nAdvocate Subhash Jha, for the petitioner, submitted that the signal, which was required to be given to the candidates, was not given.\nThe bench of Justice KV Viswanathan and Justice NK Singh noted that the present petition is fact-based and doesn't challenge the validity of any law; thus, the case wouldn't merit transfer to the Supreme Court. The bench also noted that the High Court has listed the matter on July 31.\nThe counsel requested the bench to consider the transfer to avoid conflicting decisions by different High Courts. However, the bench pointed out that the petition was a fact-based grievance specific to the petitioner.\n\"Your case depends on individual facts. We can transfer only if there are similar questions of law in petitions pending in different High Courts,\" Justice Viswanathan observed.\nHowever, considering the concern raised by the petitioner that the seats would be filled up by the middle of July, the bench allowed him to seek advancement of the hearing.\nConsidering the urgency of the matter, the bench allowed the petitioner to mention it before the Delhi High Court Chief Justice for a possible early hearing.\nThe Madhya Pradesh High Court is also considering a petition filed by candidates who contend that their performance was affected by a power outage at the examination centres in Indore.\nCase Details : ASSAD KHATRI Versus UNION OF INDIA AND ORS.|T.P.(C) No. 1746/2025",
