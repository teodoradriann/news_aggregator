    "text": "An exceptional image quality for the pleasure of your eyes\nThe main asset of formo Xming Episode One is its ability to project images in Full HD (1080p), offering a good level of detail, even on a large diagonal (up to 120 inches). With a brightness of 150 ISO Lumens, it is particularly effective in weakly lit environments, creating a perfect atmosphere for viewing films. Although the brightness is contained, limiting its use during the day, use in the darkness fully reveals the potential of this projector. In the end, these characteristics make the Xming Episode One an attractive option for moviegoers in search of quality visual performance at an affordable price.",

    "title": "ISL key to transforming Indian football, believes star duo from Meghalaya - The Shillong Times",
    "text": "By Monojit Mandal\nThe Indian Super League (ISL), touted as India’s premier football competition, has steadily become a breeding ground for exceptional talent from across the country.\nAmong the brightest stars emerging from Meghalaya, Ricky Shabong and Samuel Kynshi, playing for Punjab FC, have carved their own niche.\nBoth players believe that with consistent improvements, such as the introduction of technologies like VAR and enhanced grassroots initiatives, the ISL can position itself as one of the premier leagues in Asia, driving the overall growth of the sport in the country.\nIn an exclusive interview with The Shillong Times, the duo shared insights into their journey, aspirations, and the state of Meghalaya football.\nA Sense of Pride and Responsibility\nFor both Shabong and Kynshi, representing Meghalaya on India’s biggest football stage is more than just personal achievement; it is a responsibility. “It’s a huge honour,” said Shabong, a central midfielder known for his composure on the ball. “It inspires others back home to chase their dreams and proves that talent from Meghalaya can make a mark on the national level.”\nKynshi, a defensive midfielder hailing from the village of Nongbah Bynther, echoed similar sentiments. “Playing in the ISL and making my national team debut at the Asian Games have been proud moments for me. They highlight the strides Meghalaya football has made, with grassroots development and coach education at the forefront.”\nThe ISL Experience: A Platform for Growth\nBoth players agreed that the ISL’s competitive environment pushes them to constantly evolve.\n“The level is high, and as a professional, you have to work hard, focus, and improve every day,” said Kynshi.\n“Being surrounded by experienced players in the squad helps you learn and grow, both on and off the pitch.”\nShabong highlighted the importance of specific skill sets for his role as a central midfielder.\n“Improving ball control, passing accuracy, and dribbling has been foundational for me. A central midfielder needs to drive the team forward, and these skills are crucial to fulfilling that role.”Aspirations Beyond BordersWhile excelling in the ISL remains their immediate focus, both players harbour dreams of playing abroad. “Experiencing new playing styles and higher levels of competition is every player’s dream,” said Shabong. “For me, playing abroad would be a great opportunity to grow further.”\nKynshi, however, remains grounded in his approach. “With experience and maturity, you understand the game better. For now, my focus is on improving with each passing day and contributing to my team’s success.”\nPunjab FC: A Family Beyond Football\nBoth Shabong and Kynshi had high praise for Punjab FC, a club they describe as pivotal in their development. “Punjab FC feels like a family,” said Shabong.\n“The club provides young players with the confidence and opportunities they need to showcase their talent. It’s been the best place for me to grow as a player.\n”Kynshi emphasized the team’s culture of togetherness. “Football is a team game, and at Punjab FC, we have experienced and talented players who help each other grow. The effective communication and teamwork translate well on the pitch, which is key to our success.”\nMeghalaya Football: A Bright Future\nBoth players are optimistic about the future of football in Meghalaya. “A lot of work is being done at the grassroots level,” said Kynshi. “Competitions for young players and the rise of academies are providing talent with the right platform. This progress is already visible in Meghalaya’s performance at national-level competitions.”\nShabong believes the ISL has a role to play in uplifting Indian football as a whole.\n“The ISL has improved year by year, but introducing technologies like VAR could further elevate the league and make it one of the best in Asia.”\nRicky Shabong and Samuel Kynshi embody the aspirations of a football-loving state like Meghalaya.\nTheir journey from local fields to the ISL serves as an inspiration to countless young footballers in the region.",

    "text": "Hall of Fame coaches open March Madness together, hoping more history awaits\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. — Chris Crutchfield knows he’s the odd man out. And, for the record, totally gets it.\nWhen you’re in a four-team pod for the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament and the three other head coaches in said pod are all Hall of Famers, you’re going to notice. Rick Pitino, Bill Self and John Calipari have combined to win five national championships; the trio accounts for 17 total Final Four appearances.\n“It’s definitely the who’s who of college coaching,” Crutchfield said. “I’m sure a lot of people are asking, ‘Who the hell is that other guy in the bracket?’”\nThat would be the 56-year-old head coach of the Omaha Mavericks, who are first-time participants in the Division I men’s NCAA Tournament. Crutchfield’s crew will face Pitino and his second-seeded St. John’s team on Thursday night. The winner of that game gets either Self’s Kansas squad or Calipari’s Arkansas team in the second round on Saturday.\nFor fans, the Providence site is something close to college basketball nirvana, with three of the four active Hall of Fame coaches sharing this court on Thursday night. They also make up half of the six current men’s college basketball coaches with a national title to their name (even with one championship and a few Final Fours later vacated by the NCAA).\nIn an era perhaps best known for its exodus of HOFers, it’s a genuine treat to see so many in one place in the month of March.\nCalipari, for one, doesn’t think that’s an accident. He loves a good old fashioned selection committee conspiracy theory.\nBefore Selection Sunday, Calipari saw that Arkansas was projected to be a No. 10 seed, which meant the Razorbacks would play a No. 7 seed. He predicted that they’d draw Kansas, projected on or around that seed line. He told his players they’d for sure get St. John’s as the No. 2 seed in their region, too. The selection committee wouldn’t be able to resist the temptation of these storylines.\n“I thought it may be played somewhere else,” Calipari said.\nLike … Lexington?\n“When I saw we weren’t there, I’m like, wow, somebody (on the selection committee) must have been sick and went to the bathroom or something for them not the put us there,” Calipari joked.\nSelf said that he, too, thought he’d draw Calipari’s squad. It’s just the way the math of 7-10 matchups was likely to work out, with both of those teams in the right ranges.\n“I said, ‘You watch, we’re going to play Arkansas,’” Self said. “I didn’t have any idea who the No. 2 would be, but I think it’s fine for us.”\nHe chuckled. Sure, there have been lots of questions about the history between Arkansas and Kansas as well as the history between the two head coaches. But nothing here has gotten more attention than the possibility of a Calipari-Pitino matchup in the second round. Which means no one is really talking about the seventh-seeded Jayhawks.\n“We’ve been talked about enough over the years and over time,” Self said. “I’m kind of looking forward to having people talk about others. Maybe we can kind of sneak up on somebody.”\nFrankly, it’s a weird place for Kansas to be, both literally and figuratively. The Jayhawks are usually a much higher seed, assigned a first-weekend site closer to home. But Kansas has been quite inconsistent this season, finishing sixth in the Big 12 standings. So, this is a team that is not being discussed as a favorite to cut down the nets. Or even in the mix to do so.\nPitino has obvious history with Providence; he reached his first Final Four with the Friars in 1987. Calipari’s Final Four run at UMass included an early stop in this city. Meanwhile, Self is trying to get out of the first weekend for the first time since his Jayhawks won it all in 2022. And Crutchfield wants to capture some of the March magic other double-digit seeds have found in the past.\nAnd that’s what’s so great about this tournament. Three of these head coaches have combined to account for nearly 2,500 career wins. The fourth hasn’t cracked win No. 100. But here they are, sharing a court — and the opportunity to do something special.\n“I told my team this: Do you understand what March can do for you in life?” Pitino said. “Some of my (former championship-winning) players in Lexington, I don’t know if they’re working, but they’re living a good life.\n“If you have that type of run in March, you become part of basketball history.”",

Advertisement For the first time in nearly 20 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecasted a \"severe\" G4 geomagnetic storm to hit this Friday, dazzling states across the northern US with aurora borealis .\nG4 storms are the second-strongest type of geomagnetic storm. \"If geomagnetic storms were hurricanes, 'severe' would be category 4,\" according to SpaceWeather.com.\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . In the past, powerful geomagnetic storms have also been known to mess with electronics on satellites causing communication blackouts and disrupt the grid — triggering voltage control problems that can result in power outages.\nFor example, in October 2003, a G5 solar storm — the most severe type of g-storm — caused power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.\nAdvertisement Satellites are especially vulnerable to high-energy particles from powerful solar eruptions. BlackJack3D/Getty Images In preparation for Friday's G4 event, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center has notified satellite and grid operators of the oncoming storm \"so they can take protective action ,\" the center announced Thursday.\nFor example, grid operators will likely withhold maintenance on Friday and Saturday to reduce the amount of stress they're putting on the grid, Matt Owens, a professor of space physics at the University of Reading, told Business Insider.\nRelated stories\nAll that is to say, experts told Business Insider they don't expect to see any major issues this Friday.\n\"It's possible,\" Owens said. \"If I was a betting man, I'd say there won't be serious effects. But I imagine there will be some impressive aurora .\"\nWhat causes a geomagnetic storm Solar flares erupt from the sun's surface and go flying into space, sometimes headed for Earth. Wikimedia Commons Geomagnetic storms occur when high-energy particles from the sun reach Earth and interact with our magnetic field.\nAdvertisement But the sun is 93 million miles away, so to reach us these particles have to get a major boost. That boost comes from solar storms.\nSolar storms happen when the sun shoots powerful explosions of highly-energized and magnetic plasma called coronal mass ejections toward Earth.\nTo be clear, the sun is constantly erupting and hurling particles into space. Most of them are directed away from Earth and never reach us. Occasionally one will come our way, sparking a minor G1 or G2 storm.\nCharged particles from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field. NASA However, a G4 storm, like the one forecast through this weekend, is rare. The last time NOAA issued a G4 storm watch was in 2005.\nAdvertisement Forecasts like these better help the folks managing satellites and power grids prepare. However, ultimately, we won't know how intense the storm will be until it's already here.\nForecasting solar storms is tricky Aurora borealis are usually contained to the uppermost art of the Northern Hemisphere. But US states as far south as Alabama may be able to see them this Friday. George Lepp/Getty Images Forecasting solar storms is tricky. \"Sometimes we find that the storms can be stronger than we thought, or they can be somewhat of a dud,\" Alex Young, the associate director for science at NASA Goddard's Heliophysics Science Division, told BI.\nThis particular storm is especially difficult to track because it's made up of five separate coronal mass ejections , all hurtling towards Earth at roughly 560 miles per second, Owens said.\nIn case the storm is severe and triggers outages, it's always best to respond how you would for any power outage : keep your fridge closed, disconnect appliances to avoid damage from an electrical surge, and check with local officials about heating and cooling locations. Also, a severe storm might disrupt GPS, so it's best to have a written record and directions to important locations, like hospitals.\nAdvertisement Also all signs point to an incredible light show for northern US states on Friday night, potentially reaching as far south as New York and Pennsylvania, Young said.\nRead next\nWatch: Greek cities turned into lakes by deadly Storm Daniel Space Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",
