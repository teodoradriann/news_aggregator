    "title": "Federal judge overturns jury's conviction in Gambrills urgent care owner's health care fraud case",
    "text": "A federal judge acquitted a Gambrills physician last week in a rare ruling that cast aside a jury’s August verdict that found the doctor guilty of multiple health care fraud counts. U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar, who presided over the three-week trial this summer, wrote in his decision that he found the case’s record “lacks evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that” certain statements made by Dr. Ron Elfenbein, the former director of an urgent care chain headquartered in Gambrills, were false. The judge noted in his Dec. 21 memorandum that he “does not take lightly” his decision to throw aside the jury’s guilty verdict on the Medicare billing fraud counts for submitting more than $15 million in claims, which the government alleged were fraudulent, for patients who received COVID-19 tests. “This is the rare case that merits overturning the jury’s verdict,” he wrote, adding that having observed the trial and having “carefully parsed” the case’s record, he concluded “that [the jury’s verdict](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/08/gambrills-doctor-convicted-of-health-care-fraud-after-covid-19-test-scheme/) cannot stand.” A spokesperson for the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s office said prosecutors had no comment on Bredar’s decision, which also conditionally granted defense attorneys’ request to give Elfenbein a new trial in the event the Department of Justice wins an appeal of the decision. Prosecutors had not filed any notice that they intended to appeal the case as of Thursday afternoon. Elfenbein, a doctor from Arnold who opened the Gambrills-based chain of First Call Medical Center locations after multiple runs for office, now “looks forward to getting his life back together,” former Baltimore State’s Attorney Gregg Bernstein, part of the physician’s defense team, said Thursday. He said Elfenbein and his legal team were “of course thrilled by Judge Bredar’s very thoughtful, detailed and comprehensive decision,” which he said agreed with “what we believed all along, which was that Dr. Elfenbein is innocent.” The former emergency care physician resigned from his position as medical director of the urgent care chain after being indicted in April 2022 on charges stemming from his company’s billing claims. Federal prosecutors alleged the urgent care facility billed insurers for complex medical procedures when the establishment had simply given patients COVID-19 tests. The doctor’s indictment turned attention to then-Del. Sid Saab, who was [connected](https://www.capitalgazette.com/2019/04/24/anne-arundel-county-delegate-posts-advertisements-tries-to-sell-car-on-official-social-media/) to the urgent care business but [resisted](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/08/gambrills-doctor-convicted-of-health-care-fraud-after-covid-19-test-scheme/) [questions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/23/maryland-covid-fraud/) about the scope of his involvement. The Republican candidate sued his opponent in that year’s general election for defamation, in part referencing campaign mailers — which were not actually sent by Sen. Dawn Gile — connecting Saab to Elfenbein’s indictment. He dropped the suit after [losing to Gile](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2022/11/16/annapolis-state-sen-sarah-elfreth-declares-victory-dawn-gile-overtakes-sid-saab-in-district-33-senate-race/), a Severna Park Democrat. Federal prosecutors later expanded the charges to include allegations the urgent care chain fraudulently billed other insurers, like Medicaid, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and the Health Resources and Services Administration COVID-19 Uninsured Program. Awaiting sentencing after the jury’s Aug. 4 verdict, Elfenbein faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison for each of the five counts. The sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for November, was put off as Bredar considered defense attorneys’ motion to acquit the physician. Much of the government’s case hinged on the urgent care chain’s use of certain medical billing codes, which prosecutors alleged overcharged the insurers. Elfenbein’s defense team argued during the trial, and in their argument to acquit the doctor, that there was enough ambiguity in the definitions of the billing codes that prosecutors could not establish that the urgent care falsely submitted claims under the wrong key. In his decision last week, Bredar sided with the defense team, finding “the evidence does not support the jury’s apparent finding that billing” at a different level for the COVID-19 tests “was false or fraudulent.”",

Since the launch of a new round of east-west cooperation in 2021, with the joint efforts of both parties, a large number of assistance projects have been implemented and achieved results, releasing surging momentum. Since the launch of a new round of east-west collaboration in 2021, the collaborating provinces have given full play to the comparative advantages of each region, strengthened industrial cooperation, resource complementarity, labor docking, and talent exchanges, forming a multi-level, multi-form, and all-round collaborative assistance pattern. At present, East-West cooperation has become an important force in consolidating and expanding the results of poverty alleviation and promoting comprehensive rural revitalization. In 2023, 8 eastern provinces and cities will invest 23.19 billion yuan in financial assistance to 10 western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and the two parties will exchange 3,045 temporary party and government cadres and 25,000 professional and technical personnel.

Complementary regional advantages and two-way flow of factors Complementary regional advantages and two-way flow of factors Promote the vigorous development of industries that strengthen the county and enrich the people Promote the vigorous development of industries that strengthen the county and enrich the people In Kuiduo Town, Jiulong County, Sichuan Province, there are 3,900 acres of alpine tea gardens covered with greenery. At the beginning of winter, Xihu District of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province and local tea experts jointly held a preliminary winter management research and judgment meeting, organizing tea farmers to carry out deep plowing, pruning, rejuvenation and other management and maintenance operations to lay the foundation for the germination of new tea in spring. In the live broadcast room not far away, a black tea jointly produced by West Lake District and Jiulong County is selling like hot cakes - Kowloon local tea is combined with the production technology of West Lake Jiuqu Red Plum, and the tea has a particularly long-lasting aroma. \"A leaf on the southern slope of Gongga condenses the deep tea relationship between the two places.\" Qin Xiuzhen, secretary of the Party Committee of Kuido Town, said that the local area has many original ecological ancient tea trees and the tea is of good quality, but the mountains are high and the roads are far away, so sales have always been slow. On one side is a high-quality raw material production base, on the other side is mature technology and marketing experience. With the cooperation and assistance of Xihu District, Manshan Tea has become a gold-producing \"tea industry.\" Qin Xiuzhen introduced that in the past two years, an all-weather grid monitoring system and a comprehensive big data analysis platform have been built in the ancient tea garden to realize the full traceability of tea growth and refined management of the tea garden, turning traditional planting into a standardized and sustainable \"tea factory\" . Through in-depth surveys, protection and development of ancient tea trees, and the exploration of historical and cultural connotations such as the Ancient Tea Horse Road culture, tea villages and tea towns have also become popular tourist check-in destinations. In 2023, the comprehensive output value of Jiulong County Ecological Tea Modern Agricultural Industrial Park will be 70.83 million yuan, and tea sales revenue will be nearly 55 million yuan. Complementary advantages and resource aggregation will inject impetus into the industrial development of poverty-stricken areas. In 2023, 8 eastern provinces and cities and 10 western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities will jointly build 775 industrial parks, guide 3,049 new companies to invest 168.48 billion yuan, and purchase and help sell agricultural products in the western region worth 110.48 billion yuan. Industries grow into clusters, further amplifying development efficiency. \"We organically combine Guangxi and Guizhou's energy, land, labor and other resources with Guangdong's market, technology, and talent advantages to collaboratively build industrial clusters, collaboratively optimize the business environment, and empower high-quality development of county economies.\" Rural Guangdong Province Liu Zhengyue, director of the East-West Cooperation Division of the Revitalization Bureau, said. In Zheng'an County, Guizhou Province, a string plucks the strong sound of industry. Since the Guangdong Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone established a cooperative and assistance relationship with Zheng'an County, by jointly completing shortcomings such as basic facilities and business environment, and extending the upstream and downstream industrial chains, the guitar industry advantage cluster has achieved spatial expansion and magnitude improvement. , gradually transforming from cooperative OEM to independent innovation, manufacturing to creation. Currently, 130 guitar production and supporting companies have settled in the park, with exports exceeding US$100 million for three consecutive years. Zhao Liang, leader of the Zunyi-based working group of the Guangdong-Guizhou Cooperation Task Force, said that this year will continue to invest 2 million yuan in cooperation funds to implement projects such as comprehensive promotion and exhibition of guitar culture, and increase support for the development of guitar culture industry in Zhengji. Strengthen labor docking and train vocational skills Strengthen labor docking and train vocational skills Ensure stable employment for people lifted out of poverty Ensure stable employment for people lifted out of poverty At Guangdong Xinbao Electric Co., Ltd., most front-line workers come from outside the province. \"I have been working here for four years, and my job has always been stable.\" Li Zhenlian, a 48-year-old assembly worker from Yuandong Village, Beishi Town, Xingye County, Guangxi, was promoted to a technician through skills training in 2021, and his current monthly salary reaches more than 5,000 yuan. In response to the employment needs of the rural labor force in the 99 poverty-stricken counties in Guangxi and Guizhou, Guangdong Province has established a \"one county, one enterprise\" rural labor stabilization employment base in both directions through east-west collaboration, highlighting the role of long-term recruitment and continuous job stabilization. \"We have established labor cooperation relationships with many counties in Guangxi and Guizhou to promote targeted employment of people who have been lifted out of poverty.\" said Ma Jing, manager of the Human Resources Center Office of Xinbao Electric Company. Connect labor services, assist enterprises to stabilize their jobs, and promote stable employment for those who have been lifted out of poverty. In 2023, 8 eastern provinces and cities will help 815,000 rural laborers in 10 western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities achieve employment, including 543,000 laborers who have been lifted out of poverty. The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that after years of assistance, poverty-stricken areas have made great progress, but the overall level still lags behind. In addition, some labor forces who have been lifted out of poverty have insufficient skills, and more assistance is needed. Li Qiusheng, director of the Shandong Provincial Counterpart Support Office, said that in the past three years, Lugan and Gansu provinces have focused on brand building and established the Lugan “Artisan Alliance” to target rural migrant laborers, rural “second-generation students”, unemployed college graduates, and returning farmers. Carry out skills training for key groups such as workers and those monitored to prevent people from returning to poverty, and promote high-quality employment and entrepreneurship. Walking into a farmhouse in Maogou Village, Dongyuan Township, Dongxiang Autonomous County, Gansu Province, the \"Lanzhou Beef Noodles\" sign is eye-catching and the noodles are fragrant. The owner, Ma Wendong, participated in the \"Lanzhou Ramen Master\" training organized by the local social affairs department two years ago. After returning to the village, he opened a farm noodle shop and created employment for 12 rural laborers. At present, Lugan and Gansu provinces have collaborated to develop a number of special vocational training projects such as Lanzhou Ramen Master, Linxia Brick Carving, and Dongxiang Embroiderer. A total of about 40,000 people have been trained, and the employment rate has stabilized at more than 90%. Employment is the foundation of people's livelihood. As of the end of November 2023, the number of people lifted out of poverty nationwide was 32.939 million, exceeding the annual target of 2.747 million, stabilizing the income of more than 60% of the people lifted out of poverty. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs will work with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security to implement in-depth efforts to prevent people from returning to poverty and ensure that the number of employed people who have been lifted out of poverty remains stable at more than 30 million people. The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in terms of stabilizing the scale of migrant work, it is necessary to further give play to the role of the east-west labor cooperation mechanism, urge the eastern provinces to implement assistance responsibilities, increase the cultivation of rural craftsmen and labor brands in poverty-stricken areas, and strive to The labor force that has been lifted out of poverty is stable in their jobs, enterprises, and local areas, and their ability to promote employment is improved; the central and western regions are urged to implement the main responsibilities, strengthen the docking of labor services, and improve the degree of organization of labor export. At the same time, various policies such as one-time transportation subsidies for inter-provincial workers and employment incentives and subsidies will be implemented. Strengthen talent exchanges and improve assistance mechanisms Strengthen talent exchanges and improve assistance mechanisms Enhance the endogenous development momentum of the western cooperation region Enhance the endogenous development momentum of the western cooperation region To promote the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas, we must also create blood through mechanisms. In the past two years, Shandong-Chongqing cooperation has innovatively carried out activities for village party secretaries to go to Shandong to learn from experience. Chongqing City has selected a total of 660 village party organization secretaries from 14 districts and counties to work in villages (communities) with strong comprehensive strength in paired cities in Shandong Province. “Focusing on aspects such as industrial revitalization, rural governance, and environmental improvement, Shandong and Chongqing have jointly agreed to receive villages and arrange one-on-one training locations and positions. In terms of quota allocation, we will focus on four counties, including Chengkou County and Wuxi County in Chongqing City. The national rural revitalization key assistance counties help improve the personal abilities and comprehensive qualities of party organization secretaries in key assistance areas,\" Li Qiusheng said. \"Not only did it open my eyes, but I also learned valuable experience in developing industries in advanced villages.\" After returning from a temporary job in Zhujiazhuang Village, Daiyue District, Tai'an City, Shandong Province, Zhang Liang, Secretary of the Party Branch of Pingyang Village, Tucheng Town, Wuxi County, Chongqing City, was in a hurry. The village collective economy was developed. In the past few years, the village has organized a cooperative through the village party branch, using the barren hills and slopes to develop more than 600 acres of crisp plum industrial park and 15 acres of collective aquaculture base. Last year, the village's collective economic income exceeded 200,000 yuan. In addition to grassroots governance, \"group-based\" assistance for cadres and talents in medical, education and other fields also continues to meet the all-round development needs of collaborative areas. Shanghai has promoted more than 30 tertiary hospitals to pair up and support more than 30 county-level hospitals in Yunnan in the form of \"group + relay\" to help build and upgrade a number of key and characteristic specialties and strengthen the training of medical talents. 22 schools in Chaoyang District, Beijing, and 22 schools in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have signed a five-year one-to-one pairing assistance agreement, and 27 cadres and teachers have been selected and dispatched in 2023. In 2023, the eastern and western cooperative provinces will send more than 28,000 party and government temporary cadres and professional and technical personnel to each other, completing 212.1% of the number of agreements, further deepening the exchange of cadres and talents. At the same time, the eastern region actively promoted local rural revitalization experience, helped the western region improve the effectiveness of living environment improvement, and created 1,311 rural revitalization model villages. \"The extensive participation of the whole society has created a good atmosphere of mutual help for East-West collaboration.\" The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in 2021, the East-West collaboration pairing relationship was adjusted and improved, from the original \"one-to-many, many-many\" \"One-to-one\" has been adjusted and optimized into a long-term fixed pairing relationship in which one eastern province pairs up to support one western province. In the next step, we will continue to adhere to two-way collaboration, mutual benefit, and win-win for all parties, strengthen industrial cooperation, resource complementarity, labor docking, and talent exchanges, and promote the coordinated development, coordinated development, and common development of both parties.
