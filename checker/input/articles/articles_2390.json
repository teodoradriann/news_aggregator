    "text": "business / Inquirer Features Inquirer Features How traditional Chinese values benefit business By: Josiah Go - @inquirerdotnet Philippine Daily Inquirer / 02:12 AM January 24, 2025\nSamuel Uy —CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\nBusinessman Samuel Uy is the president of the Chinese Filipino Business Club Inc. (CFBC) and also serves as the president of Ford Tractor Philippines. In this interview, he explores the various dimensions of how Chinese-Filipino (Chinoy) culture impacts business behavior, the differences between generations and backgrounds, and approaches to conflict resolution.\nQuestion: In what ways do traditional Chinese values manifest in the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Chinoy businesses?\nArticle continues after this advertisement Answer: Traditional Chinese values play a significant role in how Chinoy businesses are managed and major decisions made. For me, I could say these values were inculcated during our growing-up years. More than just telling me, I should thank my parents for showing me these important values. The most basic is the respect and learning from the mentorship of our elders. My filial spirit gives me the opportunity to look into the pool of vast experiences and knowledge of the elder people. Other values such as trust, loyalty and dedication would follow. These values were carried forward to all our undertakings in education, businesses or career. When making important decisions, our values serve as a guiding light in our journey through our chosen field of endeavors.\nFEATURED STORIES BUSINESS BIZ BUZZ: DJ ‘John-C’ goes to AC BUSINESS Jollibee Group opens first Milksha concept store in the Philippines BUSINESS Alfonso lone Filipino in Forbes '50 over 50' list Q: How important are family ties and family associations in the business strategies of Chinoy entrepreneurs?\nA: Maintaining good family relationships is important as this is where we source our need for love and belonging; [where] our values, guidance and encouragement come from. Through our strengths and weaknesses, our ups and downs in life, the family is there to encourage us and cheer us on. In business, we treat our family as our solace and refuge during times of trial. As a Chinoy, I would say that joining the family association expands our business connections. In this venue, we can expose ourselves to more business opportunities and learn from seasoned entrepreneurs in their respective lines of businesses. It is definitely beneficial to entrepreneurs like me to expand our networks and receive guidance as we navigate through business challenges.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Q: Are there noticeable differences in business values and practices between Chinoy entrepreneurs who were born locally and those who migrated from mainland China?\nArticle continues after this advertisement A: Yes, there is a noticeable difference in business values and practices. If we were hardworking when we started our businesses in the country, I could say that those who migrated from mainland China were even more diligent and hardworking. Our locally born Chinoys have a pampered life as many parents tend to be protective of their children. Some have been exposed to the family business at their young age, which is good for them. Generally, they work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. only. You will be lucky if they report for work from Monday to Friday. They know how to enjoy what they call work and life balance.\nArticle continues after this advertisement READ: Know thy Chinese market\nHow about those who migrated from China? They are eager to exceed their capacity and to succeed in their chosen line of business. They do not have that 8-to-5 work attitude. They are up early and they can work up to late night if needed. They don’t perceive language as a hindrance and they will do anything to make sure they perform excellently in business.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Q: What cultural or value-based challenges arise when mainland-born and local-born Chinoy entrepreneurs collaborate or compete?\nA: The Philippine market is massive for every businessman. Ideally, it will be nice if the local-born Chinoy and the mainland-born Chinese can collaborate to be able to help the economy and uplift the lives of the poor. However, it’s easier said than done. Business is business and everyone will do creative things or better marketing to have a bigger share of the market. The locals observe some business etiquette and enjoy the advantages of maintaining some good local relationships. I could say this advantage will be short-lived as the mainland-born Chinese will be able to adapt quickly too. The best thing the local-born Chinoys can do is to make their business foundation solid so it can withstand the entry of the mainland-born Chinese.\nQ: What challenges and opportunities do younger Chinoy business owners face that differ from those of their elders?\nA: Young Chinoy entrepreneurs will be competing against traditional, more massive and established businesses when they will start a new business. Nevertheless, lucky are those who will be given the opportunity to continue and expand the business some more. Being more exposed to the digital and e-commerce [space], coupled with the guidance from their parents, they will have a better chance of maintaining the market share or expanding the market depending on their aggressiveness and dedication.\nQ: The Chinoy community has long relied on strong networking and mentorship systems. How do you see these relationships evolving as younger generations take on leadership roles?\nA: The younger Chinoy generation will still count on their family and family associations for networking and mentorship. In addition to the face to face interactions, the young Chinoys will also benefit from global networks and virtual cooperations. Today, the options to networking are more diverse and dynamic, which include social media and other digital collaboration with foreign business partners.\nQ: Chinoy entrepreneurs often face certain stereotypes. What do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions about Chinoy business owners, and how can these be addressed or overcome?\nA: The biggest misconception about the Chinoy business owners is that they are only focusing on making money and that they don’t do enough CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiatives to help the poor in our country. But, the truth is that many Chinoy entrepreneurs are involved in community projects through their philanthropic donations. Another stereotype is that Chinoy entrepreneurs are selling cheap but inferior China products. That is not accurate. The truth is that the option to buy good quality or low quality products is a decision of the consumers. Like in our case, we sell agricultural machineries with quality at par or even better than the known brands in the local market. We are proud that we can offer quality items at reasonable prices.\nNow the important question is, how can we change this mindset? We are addressing this misconception or misinformation by tapping the social media and the print media to inform and educate the consumers about our projects. Just early this year, the Filipino at Tsino Magkaibigan Foundation was organized to conduct more relief operations to help our calamity-stricken Filipino brothers and sisters.\nChinoys are used to being very humble and silent, but now, we encourage them to let the rest of the community know that we are also doing our part. We are now collaborating with national newspapers so our Filipino brethren can see our collaborations with the government to uplift our disadvantaged kababayans.\nQ: Are there specific cultural practices or traditional methods used to mediate and resolve disputes within the Chinoy business community?\nA: We usually use peaceful mediation rather than confrontation in resolving disputes. Family association’s elders or respected community leaders are called forward to help resolve disputes, offer a fair and reasonable solution to both parties, preserving the respect between the parties during the negotiation. Traditionally, the elders will select a neutral ground for both parties to meet and dialogue. It could be an informal meeting to have tea, coffee or a simple meal. By hearing the side of each party, they offer a solution that is mutually acceptable and beneficial; that way, both parties are able to save face and get back to their cordial relationships.\nQ: How do organizations like the CFBC play a role in fostering collaboration among Chinoy entrepreneurs? Can you speak about any key initiatives or projects that have helped local businesses thrive?\nA: At CFBCI, we practice what we call ‘business sharing’ during our monthly plenary meetings. Through this, our members enjoy the opportunity to talk more about their respective businesses to inform their fellow members and hopefully foster future collaborations.\nSince we have many projects with the government, we give our members the opportunity to supply the products needed for donation projects. Even among members, there’s networking to help promote or introduce the products among friends and acquaintances. Through trade fairs, networking opportunities and other initiatives, CFBCI helps members with best business practices and network expansion while guiding them through their challenges.\nWe have our Young Entrepreneurs Committee under the leadership of one of our vice presidents. Quarterly, we will have a half-day business seminar to allow the young entrepreneurs to learn from professional speakers discussing different aspects of the business world to motivate them as they grow their business.\nFinally, I am proud to share that CFBCI is an active member of the CICAC (Customs Industry Consultative and Advisory Council). Maintaining a good relationship with the Bureau of Customs is highly beneficial for our members, especially in addressing their custom-related concerns. We are very grateful to the excellent assistance given by the bureau and in return, we maintain our compliance with their requirements and encourage our members to do so. —CONTRIBUTED\nYour subscription could not be saved.

[21:09 01.02.2024](/20240201/)(Mis à jour: 21:18 01.02.2024) © Photo Ministère russe de la Défense / [Accéder à la base multimédia](https://sputnikmediabank.com/images/item/6476720)L'avion de transport russe Il-76MD-90A © Photo Ministère russe de la Défense/ S'abonner L'avion Il-76 russe avec des prisonniers de guerre ukrainiens à bord a été abattu par un missile Patriot, selon le Comité d'enquête russe. Trois experts militaires interrogés par Sputnik analysent l'implication des États-Unis et de l'Europe dans cette attaque survenue sur le sol russe. Une semaine après le crash d'un avion de transport Iliouchine Il-76 avec 65 prisonniers de guerre sur le territoire russe, le Comité d'enquête de Russie a établi que l'appareil a été abattu par une missile Patriot. Un expert militaire russe, un eurodéputé de l'Allemagne et un journaliste de guerre commentent ces résultats de l'enquête. Andreï Koсhkine, colonel de réserve et expert militaire: Il n’y a aucun doute que les armes fournies par les États-Unis à Kiev sont utilisées contre la Russie, dans ce cas, contre le transport de civils; L’utilisation des missiles US est contrôlée par un système global et, bien entendu, Washington sait quelle était leur destination; Il s’agit d'un crime commis soit par négligence, soit par préméditation; La Douma (chambre basse du parlement russe) [réclame que le Congrès des États-Unis précise son attitude](https://fr.sputniknews.africa/20240201/la-russie-met-washington-devant-ses-responsabilites-sur-lil-76-abattu-1064865234.html)à l'égard de la situation où les fonds et les armes américaines servent à tuer des civils en Russie; Il importe de saisir le Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu en livrant des preuves que l’Il-76 a été abattu par des missiles américains. Dr Gunnar Beck, eurodéputé de l'Allemagne: S’il s’avère que le Patriot a été livré à Kiev par l’Allemagne, Berlin niera ce fait. Il n’y aura pas d’enquête, de même que pour le sabotage contre les North Stream2; Les systèmes Patriot et Iris-T fournis à l’Ukraine devraient être utilisés à des fins défensives mais le gouvernement allemand ne les contrôle pas. C'est le signe d'une belligérance croissante de l'Allemagne à l’encontre de la Russie; Tout ce que Berlin livre à l’Ukraine diminue sa capacité militaire. Le Bundeswehr n’est pas en état de défendre son propre pays; Si Kiev continue de cibler le territoire russe avec des armes allemandes, cela entraînera une escalade du conflit en Ukraine et aux alentours. Berlin ne tient pas suffisamment compte des conséquences; Les autorités allemandes surrestiment les perspectives militaires de l’Ukraine dans ce conflit. Alors que les médias occidentaux sous-estiment l’ampleur des pertes ukrainiennes. Alexeï Borzenko, journaliste militaire: Il n’est pas exclu que ces missiles ne soient pas contrôlés par les Américains. Ces derniers n’ont fait que les fournir, les Ukrainiens les utilisent comme bon leur semble. Mais les USA contrôlent sûrement l’utilisation des missiles; Deux hypothèses sont possibles. Soit l’avion russe a été abattu à la demande des USA, soit ces derniers n'étaient vraiment pas au courant. Pour le moment, il est difficile de tirer des conclusions précises; Le Comité d’enquête russe documente tous les crimes du régime de Kiev. À un moment donné, tout deviendra clair: qui a donné l'ordre et qui l'a exécuté.",

    "text": "After three years of intense negotiations, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) have reached a consensus on a historic text aimed at preparing for and responding to future pandemics, AFP reports. \"This marks an important milestone in our common journey towards a safer world. You have made history,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told delegates. The agreement will be subject to formal approval at the World Health Assembly in May, but the consensus already reached represents a crucial moment for international cooperation in public health.\n• A victory for multilateralism\nThe final text was approved after a final round of marathon negotiations, marking a moment of euphoria among WHO delegates. \"By reaching this consensus, states have established a generational agreement for global security and demonstrated that, despite a divided world, nations can work together to respond to common threats,\" Ghebreyesus stressed. The agreement comes five years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused millions of deaths and had a devastating impact on the global economy. According to the WHO, the world remains vulnerable to a new pandemic, and this text aims to change that.\n• Technology transfer - one of the central stakes\nThe negotiations were difficult, especially around the transfer of technology related to the production of vaccines and other health products. Developing countries insisted on the need for equitable access, evoking inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic, when rich countries monopolized vaccine doses.\nAfter much debate, a compromise formula was reached, which provides for the transfer of technology agreed upon, maintaining a voluntary nature, but assuming the principle of cooperation.\n• A global system for access to medical products\nThe agreement introduces a new mechanism: the \"Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System\" (PABS), designed to ensure a more equitable distribution of medical products derived from pathogens - such as vaccines, tests and treatments. The text also aims to expand global supply and logistics networks to respond more effectively in the event of a crisis. \"It is a historic agreement for health security, equity and international solidarity,\" said Anne-Claire Amprou, France's ambassador for global health and co-chair of the negotiation process.\n• \"The virus can be worse than a war\"\nGhebreyesus warned of the consequences of inaction, arguing that a dangerous virus can have more devastating effects than an armed conflict: \"The cost of inaction is much higher. The virus is the worst enemy - it can be worse than a war.\" The agreement comes in a difficult context for multilateralism and international cooperation, marked by geopolitical crises and the US withdrawal from the WHO during the Trump administration, which generated tensions and a funding gap.",

    "title": "Boeing just the latest company to go head to head with union",
    "text": "Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job at at Boeing factories near Seattle and elsewhere early Friday after union members voted overwhelmingly to go on strike.Boeing is just the latest business to grapple with union workers over issues including wages and benefits like health care.Here's a look at some recent company negotiations with their unions.Late last year the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year. The run up to the approval was not smooth though, with contentious labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta-based UPS reached a tentative contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.At the time the tentative agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers’ days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and tentative deals on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.Earlier this month video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers' union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.The performers had been striking for over a month.Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \"exploitative uses\" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.Last month thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts , a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts .Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser’s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.Hollywood's actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series.",

    "text": "Video correlati:\nIn mezzo alla grave crisi energetica che colpisce i cubani, la rottura di una tubazione di gas manufatto aggrava la situazione per i residenti in due municipi de L'Avana, dove il fornitura di combustibile domestico si interromperà fino a quando non sarà sostituito il tratto danneggiato nei prossimi giorni.\nLa Società del Gas Manufatto ha annunciato questo mercoledì in un comunicato che, a causa di un guasto, sarà sostituito un tratto di tubazione nell'avenida 51, da 96 a 100, per “garantire la stabilità del servizio di gas nella rete Playa-Marianao”.\nPer eseguire i lavori, sarà effettuata una “fermo totale” dell'impianto di produzione #2, tra le 10 di sera di venerdì 9 maggio e le quattro del mattino di sabato 10, il che influenzerà completamente il servizio nei comuni di Playa e Marianao, ha indicato l'ente.\nL'azienda affiliata alla compagnia petrolifera statale CUPET ha offerto scuse alla popolazione colpita per \"i disagi che questa interruzione potrebbe causare\" e ha assicurato di mantenere il suo \"impegno a fornire un servizio di qualità ai propri clienti\".\nI problemi con il servizio di gas di sintesi nella capitale fanno parte della grave crisi energetica che sta attraversando Cuba, in cui influiscono anche la scarsità di gas liquefatto in tutto il paese e i continui e prolungati blackout.\nA fine aprile, la fabbrica di produzione #1 (Melones) di gas manufacturato a L'Avana ha interrotto il servizio nei municipi di Plaza de la Revolución, L'Avana Vieja, Centro Habana, Cerro e Diez de Octubre, per effettuare lavori “indifferibili” di manutenzione. Già un mese prima, l'industria aveva effettuato un'altra fermata improrogabile per “garantire la stabilità del gas” nei cinque municipi.\nNel frattempo, la scarsità di gas liquefatto continua a danneggiare la vita quotidiana di gran parte della popolazione cubana, e il governo non fornisce una soluzione a mesi di carenza del combustibile.\nDa mesi, i cittadini sono costretti a fare lunghe code per cercare di acquistare gas, aspettando per ore o giorni senza successo.\nSin nessun'altra alternativa, migliaia di famiglie si sono viste obbligate a cucinare con legna e carbone, a causa della mancanza di combustibili di base.\nÈ passato meno di due settimane, CUPET ha confermato che persiste la scarsità di gas liquefatto a causa della mancanza di forniture. “Fino ad ora non è entrata nessuna nave di gas liquefatto e continua il deficit a livello nazionale”, ha affermato l'Unità Imprenditoriale di Base di Distribuzione di Combustibili Camagüey, in un comunicato diffuso espressamente per chiarire una confusione che circolava sui social media.\nDomande frequenti sull'interruzione del servizio di gas a L'Avana\nPerché verrà interrotto il fornitura di gas in due municipi di L'Avana?\nL'interruzione della fornitura di gas di produzione nei municipi di Playa e Marianao è dovuta a una rottura di una tubatura. La Empresa de Gas Manufacturado ha indicado que se realizará una \"parada total\" de la planta de producción #2 para reemplazar el tramo averiado, con el objetivo de garantizar la estabilidad del servicio. Esto forma parte de la crisis energética que afecta a Cuba, donde la escasez de gas licuado y los apagones son habituales.\nQuanto tempo durerà l'interruzione del servizio di gas a L'Havana?\nLa sospensione del servizio di gas è programmata per iniziare la notte di venerdì 9 maggio e si prevede che termini nella mattinata di sabato 10 maggio. L'Azienda del Gas Manifatturato stima che il servizio sarà ripristinato nei prossimi giorni dopo la sostituzione della sezione danneggiata.\nIn che modo la crisi energetica a Cuba influisce sui cittadini?\nLa crisi energetica a Cuba ha generato molteplici problemi per la popolazione, inclusa la scarsità di gas liquefatto e prolungati blackout. I cittadini affrontano lunghe code per acquistare gas e, in mancanza di forniture, molti sono costretti a ricorrere a metodi alternativi come l'uso della legna e del carbone per cucinare. Questa situazione ha deteriorato la qualità della vita e aumentato la frustrazione tra i cubani.\nQuali misure sta adottando l'azienda Gas Manufacturado per risolvere la situazione?\nL'Azienda di Gas Manufatto ha annunciato che procederà alla sostituzione del tratto danneggiato della tubazione nell'avenida 51 per garantire la stabilità del servizio di gas. Inoltre, hanno espresso il loro impegno a offrire un servizio di qualità ai loro clienti e hanno porgendo scuse per i disagi che l'interruzione potrebbe causare. Tuttavia, la soluzione a lungo termine rimane incerta a causa della persistente crisi energetica nel paese.\nArchiviato in:",
