    "text": "The Nordiq Canada Ski Nationals kicked off on a high note for Thunder Bay skiers on Monday. Skiers from Lappe Nordic, Big Thunder, Lakehead University and NTDC Thunder Bay have all converged alongside 800 athletes from across the country on the trails of the Canmore Nordic Centre for the 2025 National Championships.\nThe first day of racing was an individual start freestyle technique race for the U18 and U16 categories. Reid Thompson of Big Thunder is the first local skier to step on the podium finishing 2nd in the U16 Boys 5km race of over 135 athletes. In the same event his teammates Oskar Berglund, Cedar Clark and Palmer Hunt finished 32nd, 34th and 49th, respectively. Nigel Kingston (Lappe Nordic) finished 88th and Felix Doucet (Lappe Nordic) finished 99th. Jill Thompson (Big Thunder) was the top U16 Girl finishing 61st, with Hanna Abbink (Lappe Nordic) not far behind in 65th. Laine Hupka (Lappe Nordic) was 72nd, Nemma Clark (Big Thunder) was 78th, Klara van Duyn (Big Thunder) was 97th. The U18 Categories raced a grueling 10km event. Min Dobson of Lappe Nordic was the top local skier with a Top 10 finish, in 8th, followed by teammates Tzipi Levkoe-Stephens in 12th, Charlotte Ailey in 34th, and Kiera Hall in 39th. Big Thunder’s Delaney Summers finished 47th, Kaia Hakanen (Lappe Nordic) finished 49th, and Sydney Ball (Lappe Nordic) in 83rd. In the Boys’ 10 km race Mikkai Jamsa (Lappe Nordic) was the top local skier in 14th place. Huntington McNab (Big Thunder) finished 65th, Willem Abbink (Lappe Nordic) finished 68th, Rudy Balabuck (Big Thunder) was 83rd, Sam Vanlenthe (Big Thunder) was 103rd. In the ParaNordic PNV1 Race, Jesse Bachinsky of Kenora finished 2nd, just 7 seconds off the leader with Lappe Nordic’s Matthew Cuddy as his guide.\nDay 2 of racing was a classic technique sprint race for the U18/U16 athletes. All athletes competed in a qualification time trial in the morning and the top 30 skiers in each category moved on to elimination heats. Once again Reid Thompson stepped onto the podium to claim his second silver medal in two days. Also in the U16 race Nigel Kinston also qualified for the heats and raced through to the semi finals, finishing 11th for the day. Palmer Hunt finished 40th, Cedar Clark 48th, Oskar Berglund 84th and Felix Doucet 107th. In the U16 Girls race Hanna Abbink was the only Thunder Bay skier to qualify and race the heats finishing 29th for the day. Jill Thompson finished 40th, Nemma Clark finished 67th, Klara van Duyn finished 92nd, and Laine Hupka finished 97th. In the U18 girls race, Tzipi Levkoe-Stephens qualified 15th and raced her way up to 12th racing in the semi-finals, while teammate Min Dobson qualified 29th and raced up to 25th in the quarter finals. Kiera Hall finished 38th, Charlotte Ailey 43rd, Delaney Summers 57th, Kaia Hakanen 69th and Sydney Ball 93rd. In the Boys race Willem Abbink and Rudy Balabuck both qualified for the heats racing in the quarterfinals to 13th and 30th place finishes, respectively. Mikkai Jamsa finished 42nd, Sam Vanlenthe finished 53rd and Huntington McNab finished 65th. On Day 3 at Nationals the Junior categories will rest and prepare for their next events while the Senior categories will compete in an interval start free technique race. In the ParaNordic sprint, Jesse Bachinsky and Guide Matthew Cuddy claimed their second silver medal of the week.",

    "title": "'Up and Atom!': The Human Pangenome Project: WashU research captures human genetic diversity - Student Life",
    "text": "Scene\n‘Up and Atom!’: The Human Pangenome Project: WashU research captures human genetic diversity\nThe Human Genome Project (HGP) was a 13-year, multi-billion-dollar effort that partially took place at WashU, and concluded in 2003 with the creation of the “human genome reference sequence” — a comprehensive map of the DNA found in one human cell. Today, the reference genome is a powerful tool for clinical research, helping to identify the mutations in individual patients’ DNA. However, WashU researchers say the reference genome is due for a major update.\nMore than 20 years after the conclusion of the Human Genome Project, Macias and other researchers at Wang Lab in the Department of Genetics and Center for Genome Sciences & Systems Biology are working as a part of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), an NIH-funded project working to create a reference “pangenome” to capture the full range of human diversity.\n“‘You cannot use a single reference!’ I will scream that from the rooftops,” said Dr. Juan Macias, a postdoctoral researcher at the Wang Lab. While the reference genome remains a cornerstone of genetic research, Macias says it represents only a narrow slice of human diversity.\n“[Using the reference genome] is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle,” explained Macias. “We just have the picture on the box, and we’re using it to match the pieces to the picture. The problem is that [a] single picture is not representative of very many individuals.”\nRather than using a single reference of what a human’s DNA should look like, the HPRC seeks to combine the genomes of many individuals into a widely applicable map of human genetics — the pangenome.\nCreating an accurate picture of human genetics is no small undertaking. The HPRC’s first draft of a pangenome reference was released in May of 2023, and included nearly complete genome assemblies representing 47 different individuals, each of whom were specifically chosen to achieve the widest possible diversity.\nThe nature of this pangenome is more than just a big list of genomes to reference; it is a computational map that links genomes together where they share similarities, and branches off where they have differences. For researchers like Macias, modeling the relationships of these genomes poses a unique computational challenge, but the benefits could be instrumental for treating diseases such as cancer and Alhzheimer’s.\nIn more concrete terms, Macias expressed that the pangenome offers a faster, more effective, and often cheaper way to narrow down genetic loci (specific locations) where genetic variation impacts the body’s ability to fight such diseases.\n“I’m particularly interested in understanding how those individual level variations are going to impact our ability to leverage stem cell therapies, iPSCs [induced pluripotent stem cells] in particular, to develop therapeutics in the future.”\nIn the next draft, HPRC will expand the pangenome to include DNA from more than 200 people, making it far more effective than the first draft at capturing the full diversity of the human population. Macias explains that this kind of reference will become essential for advancing personalized medicine, a primary goal of the NIH.\n“It’s clear that it’s going to have a very significant impact. Anything that deals with clinical genetics will be dramatically improved. The problem is how we get people to adopt it, how we teach them to use it effectively and really to leverage the unique beneficial properties of the pangenome.”\nIn addition to being a monumental project for all of genomics, Macias says that working on the pangenome has also been an engaging and transformative part of his scientific journey. He was pursuing a career in agriculture when he began his PhD at WashU, but soon changed course when he encountered the pangenome.\n“My family has a history in agriculture in Mexico, so working in agrotech was sort of a natural connection. But [at WashU] they tell you ‘do rotations and in areas that you’ve never done anything in, because you never know what you might like.’ Turns out, I really like weird, complicated genetics.”\nAs this project continues, the Department of Genetics, where this research is performed, will celebrate its 50th anniversary with a symposium on April 24. The symposium will feature speakers who were instrumental to the creation of modern genomics, including talks from Robert Waterson, one of the pioneers of the original Human Genome Project, and Eric Green, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and WashU alum.",

    "title": "South Korea’s ability to arm Ukraine elevates its role at NATO summit",
    "text": "One of the most influential people attending the NATO summit leads a country that is not a member. Yet it holds vast stores of weapons sought by the bloc to help Ukraine fight off Russia, and perhaps tip the battle in Kyiv’s favor.\nUkraine needs artillery shells. South Korea has millions, and there is a push to convince its President Yoon Suk Yeol to change a government policy that prohibits Seoul from sending lethal aid to countries at war.\nYoon is attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit this week for the third time but this visit is different. Just weeks before it opened, his government said a defense pact signed between Russia and North Korea in June has made it consider whether it’s time to start sending weapons to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s forces.\nZelenskyy, who has been seeking weapons from South Korea since Russia’s full-scale invasion started in 2022, will be attending the summit in Washington aimed at proving that NATO is as strong as ever in its 75th year. He is expected to speak at a meeting of the Indo-Pacific Four partners — Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — the Yomiuri newspaper reported, where he could again lay out his case for weapons.\n“The types of weapons South Korea can provide Ukraine are the ones that can make breakthroughs in the current stalemate on the front lines,” said Park Won Gon, a professor at South Korea’s Ewha Womans University, specializing in international relations.\nApart from the appeals from Zelenskyy, leaked intelligence obtained by the New York Times last year indicates Washington has been seeking to have Yoon send artillery to help Ukraine. Yoon’s aides were worried about pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, a document showed, and the Yoon government has denied the claims.\nCongress finally approved $61 billion in funding in April, helping shift the balance of firepower, but the U.S. and its European partners still need to ramp up their ability to make artillery shells.\nThe European Union missed a pledge to provide Ukraine with 1 million rounds of artillery by the end of March, and any munitions from South Korea could help fill shortfalls. Ukraine is estimated to need at least 200,000 rounds a month.\nAn unnamed senior NATO official said anything that South Korea provides to help Ukraine defend itself would be welcome, Yonhap News agency reported.\nSouth Korea has 155-millimeter artillery shells that are the NATO standard used by Ukraine. The stock is estimated to be at over 3 million shells, Yonhap reported.\nSeoul may be less worried now about drawing down its inventory after seeing North Korea sending to Russia what Yoon’s government believes could be nearly 5 million shells. These arms transfers translated into Kyiv’s troops being outgunned by as much as 10-1 by President Vladimir Putin’s forces as military aid to Ukraine was delayed in the U.S. Congress this year.\nSouth Korea could also consider sending 105 mm artillery shells, which have less range but are fired from howitzers that are lighter and more mobile, the Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report in March. South Korea has as many as 3.4 million shells that can be used by Ukraine, it said.\nMeanwhile, countries bordering Russia have been buying weapons from the likes of South Korea’s leading defense contractor, Hanwha Aerospace Co. Its tanks and howitzers are seen as less expensive than those from U.S. makers and able to defeat Russian systems.\nYoon has said any decision on sending weapons would depend on Russia’s action. Lawmaker Kim Gunn, who served under Yoon as a chief nuclear envoy until February, said the threat to supply arms to Ukraine is leverage to deter Russia from providing military support to North Korea.\nOfficials in Seoul have indicated a red line would be material, particularly technology that enhances Kim’s ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Putin has said he can’t exclude providing Kim with high-precision weapons in response to Western military assistance for Ukraine.\n“From Seoul’s point of view, Russia’s cooperation with North Korea is a direct threat to its national security,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center. She said it not only aids in advancing North Korea’s weapons development but helps Pyongyang “manage and even improve its national economy by reviving the munitions industry.”\nLee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA’s Open Source Enterprise, said South Korea has been able to deflect pressure by promoting other ways to contribute to NATO, such cybersecurity, and Seoul should move cautiously.\n“Direct provision of weapons to Ukraine is a major step, and that decision should be made based on South Korea’s national interest, which should also take into consideration its longer-term interest vis-a-vis Russia,” she said.\n___\n© 2024 Bloomberg L.P\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Israel Destroy Belgian Aid Agency Office in Gaza",
    "text": "A Belgian official posted photos showing the building housing its aid agency’s offices in Gaza was destroyed by an Israeli air strike on the besieged Palestinian enclave. The building was targeted as Belgium is refusing to cut off assistance to the Palestinian UN aid agency.\nMinister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy Caroline Gennez posted photos of the building before and after it was destroyed on X. “The office building of\nEnabel, the Belgian Agency for Development Cooperation, in Gaza, has been bombed and is completely destroyed,” her post explained. “Attacking civilian buildings is and remains totally unacceptable.”\nShe added that Brussels had summoned Tel Aviv’s ambassador.\nExecutive Vice President of the Quincy Institute, Trita Parsi,\nnoted that Israel targeted the Belgian office as Brussels is resisting pressure to cut funding to the Palestinian UN aid agency. “Belgium is one of the Western countries that has refused to cut funding to UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency). So Israel just bombed the office of the Belgian Agency for Development Cooperation in Gaza,” he wrote on X. “This is a direct result of the impunity Washington has provided Israel.”\nLast week, Israel informed UNRWA that a dozen of its employees participated in the October 7 Hamas attack. The agency’s leadership took immediate action to terminate the employees, even as Tel Aviv’s evidence was based on confessions given during interrogation. It is a dubious source, given Israel’s widespread abuse of Palestinian prisoners over the past four months.\nTel Aviv has since claimed that it also has evidence obtained from cell phones.\nThe US, Germany, and several other Western countries cut funding to UNRWA over the Israeli allegations. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN,\nsaid Washington would not resume funding to UNRWA until the organization undergoes substantial reforms. “We need to look at the organization, how it operates in Gaza.” She continued, “how [UNRWA] manage their staff and to ensure that people who commit criminal acts, such as these 12 individuals, are held accountable immediately so that UNRWA can continue the essential work that it’s doing.”\nSeveral human rights officials have\nwarned that the aid cuts will push Gaza into famine and increase the death of Palestinians in the Strip. On Sunday, Michael Fakhri, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, posted on X, “Some states decided to defund UNRWA for the alleged actions of a small number of employees. This collectively punishes +2.2 million Palestinians. Famine was imminent. Famine is now inevitable.”",

    "title": "Sequential GP-UCB Bayesian Optimization for Deep Neural Network Fine-Tuning in Dissolved Oxygen Prediction",
    "text": "Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is a key indicator of water quality, essential for sustaining aquatic ecosystems and human uses. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is recognized as an effective approach for predicting DO levels by learning from data rather than requiring explicit human knowledge input. The effectiveness of deep learning models improves with fine-tuning of hyperparameters. Amongst hyperparameter tuning methods, Bayesian methods have gained particular interest for optimization. This study focuses on predicting DO levels in riverine environments using a Deep Neural Network model. The research employs a Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) Bayesian optimization technique to fine-tune hyperparameters, aiming for an optimal configuration. Comparative analysis is conducted between the optimized model and baseline model with default settings. Results indicate that the Bayesian-optimized model outperforms the baseline, particularly evident with moderately sized datasets. The findings underscore the pivotal role of Bayesian optimization in elevating model performance, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities while significantly reducing the need for manual parameter tuning. This successful application underscores a substantial methodological advancement in environmental management, particularly in predictive modelling for indicators of aquatic ecosystem health.",
