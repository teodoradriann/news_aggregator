    "text": "fotosíntesis de las plantas, lo que podría impulsar el crecimiento de diversos cultivos. La investigación, desarrollada por el Instituto de Tecnología Avanzada de Shenzhen (sureste) y la Universidad Jiaotong de Shanghái (este), demostró que los puntos cuánticos de carbono del nanomaterial transforman la luz ultravioleta que las plantas no absorben y la luz verde que asimilan con baja eficiencia, en luz roja, aprovechable para la fotosíntesis.\nEl nanomaterial, elaborado con desechos agrícolas como paja y hojas, fue introducido en medios de cultivo líquidos para microorganismos conocidos como cianobacterias y también rociado sobre diversas especies de plantas como la ‘Arabidopsis thaliana’, según un estudio publicado en la revista científica Communications Materials y recogido este miércoles por medios estatales.\nLos resultados mostraron un incremento de 2,4 veces en la tasa de fijación de dióxido de carbono de las cianobacterias productoras de glicerol, así como un aumento de 2,2 veces en su producción de este compuesto. Mientras, la biomasa de las citadas ‘Arabidopsis thaliana’ aumentó en un 80 %. Experimentos preliminares mostraron avances en el desarrollo de especies como lentejas de agua, cacahuetes, maíz y soja, y los investigadores informaron de sus planes de realizar nuevos experimentos con otros cultivos.\nEl estudio destaca que este nanomaterial no solo es biocompatible, es decir, no genera toxicidad, sino también económico, al utilizar residuos agrícolas abundantes como materia prima. Esto, según los autores, lo convierte en una alternativa sostenible para potenciar la productividad de cultivos. (Información de EFE)",

    "title": "Former 'IS bride' to learn UK citizenship fate - Breitbart",
    "text": "A judgement is expected Friday in the appeal case of a woman who lost her British citizenship after leaving as a teenager to marry an Islamic State group fighter. Shamima Begum, 24, took her case against the revocation of her citizenship to the Court of Appeal in London in October last year. Her lawyer told the court that the Home Office had failed to consider its legal duties to Begum as a potential victim of trafficking. Begum, whose family is of Bangladeshi origin, was 15 years old when she left her east London home for Syria with two school friends in 2015. While there, she married an IS fighter and had three children, none of whom survived. In February 2019, Begum said she was left stateless when Britain’s interior minister at the time, Sajid Javid, revoked her British citizenship on national security grounds after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. A UK tribunal ruled in 2020 that she was not stateless because she was “a citizen of Bangladesh by descent” when the decision was made, by virtue of her Bangladeshi mother. Last year, Begum lost a challenge against the decision at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The SIAC said that while there was a “credible suspicion that Begum was recruited, transferred and then harboured for the purpose of sexual exploitation”, this did not prevent Javid from removing her citizenship. The ruling meant that Begum could not return to the UK from her current home, a refugee camp in northern Syria. Lawyers for the Home Office have argued that SIAC’s conclusion was correct. Begum is one of hundreds of Europeans whose fate has challenged governments following the 2019 collapse of the Islamist extremists’ self-styled caliphate. Begum’s lawyer told the SIAC hearing that her client had been “influenced” along with her friends by a “determined and effective” IS group “propaganda machine”. Around 900 people are estimated to have travelled from Britain to Syria and Iraq to join the IS group. Of those, around 150 are believed to have been stripped of their citizenship, according to government figures.",

    "title": "Want To Be a Millionaire? Embrace These 13 Habits Now",
    "text": "Want To Be a Millionaire? Embrace These 13 Habits Now\nOne million dollars is a number that many people set as a target for their\nretirement nest egg, and it has something of a mythical feel about it. The very idea of being a millionaire symbolizes great wealth for most Americans, and indeed only about 8.8% of Americans actually are millionaires, putting them in the category of the financial elite.\nHowever, there are concrete steps that anyone can take to increase their chances of reaching a seven-digit net worth. By starting early enough and implementing some of these financial steps, you may find yourself in this rarefied company\nmore easily than you think.\nStart Investing Early\nProbably the single biggest step you can take towards achieving millionaire status is to start investing early. As Mark Cuban said, “When investing, the best thing you can do is start early.” Socking away as little as $200 per month when you are 20 can translate to over $1 million by age 65 if you earn an 8% return on your investments. While no investment return is guaranteed, the long-term average return of the S&P 500 index easily eclipses this 8% target. However, as billionaire Warren Buffet advised: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.” So, better to start now than not at all.\nSave Until It Hurts\nYou might have heard that you should save at least 10% of your income to generate long-term wealth. While that’s a great start, if you want to\nbecome a millionaire, you’ll have to save until it hurts. This means different things for different people. If you’re only earning $25,000 per year, saving 10% of your money might hurt a little — but try pushing it to 15% or 20%. If you earn $200,000 per year, you might be able to push that savings rate to 50% or more. Or, to put it simply, listen to Buffet: “Do not save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.”\nInvest in Appreciating Assets, Not Depreciating Ones\nOne of the most important steps in reaching millionaire status is to only put your money into investments that will generate a positive return for you. In plain English, this means you should be investing in assets that have demonstrated long-term earnings potential, like the stock market and real estate, not in assets that lose value every day, like new cars or consumer goods.\nContinually Increase Your Income\nThe cost of living goes up nearly every year, so if your income doesn’t grow as well, you’ll never generate true wealth. Regularly ask for raises at your job so your income rises faster than the inflation rate. If you can’t squeeze any more money out of your current job, consider taking on a side gig or some type of additional work so you can continue to raise your income.\nGenerate Passive Income\nMillionaires and billionaires agree: Passive income is incredibly important to amassing a fortune. As Buffet said, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,” It’s hard to get wealthy just from earning a salary. But you can get to millionaire status a lot more quickly if you generate income that you don’t have to work for, known as passive income. A classic example is rental income. Once you buy a rental property, you’ll get paid every month by your renters without having to do any additional work beyond routine maintenance and repairs. If your rental income exceeds the amount you pay for your mortgage, property tax and other costs, you’re essentially using other people’s money to pay for your property while you sit and watch its value increase. Be like investor and author Robert Kiyosaki, who said, “my passive income exceeds my expenses. That’s financial independence.”\nPay Off Credit Card Debt\nKnocking down your credit card balances won’t earn you any money, but it might still be the best “investment” you ever make. If you carry a balance on your credit card, you may be paying interest of 20% or more annually. No investment you make can reliably generate those types of returns, so paying off any outstanding balances you have is one of the best possible uses of your money.\nMaximize Your 401(k) Match\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a 401(k) match at your job, you absolutely must take advantage of it each and every year. A 401(k) match may be the closest thing to free money you’ll ever receive, and best of all, it’s deposited into a tax-advantaged investment account. Even if you can’t contribute the absolute maximum to your 401(k) every year, at least contribute enough to claim your full employer match.\nMaintain a Top-Tier Credit Score\nAs financial guru\nSuze Orman said, “A good credit score is better than money.” A top-tier credit score won’t put any money in your pocket directly, but it can save you literally tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime, perhaps even more. With a credit score above 740, you can usually qualify for the lowest available interest rates on everything from home mortgages to auto loans, and the savings can really pile up. A $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 3.0% vs. 4.5%, for example, will save you over $74,000 in interest over the life of the loan.\nLive in an Affordable Community\nAmerica is a vast country with plenty of comfortable places to live. If you can live in a lower-cost area while still earning the same salary, it’s the same as if you got a significant raise. As more and more companies are allowing their employees to work remotely, see if you can move to a less-expensive area and boost your savings rate to help you achieve millionaire status.\nBe Entrepreneurial and Take Calculated Risks\n“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today,” said U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Millionaires are often willing to take smart risks to grow their money through new business ventures. Calculated risks and entrepreneurship can lead to greater reward.\nNetwork and Seek Mentorship\nSurrounding yourself with knowledgeable peers and mentors accelerates learning and unlocks opportunities. As Shark Tank’s Daymond John said,”Finding mentors has been key to my success.” Millionaires invest time in networking and mentor relationships.\nLearn Constantly and Improve Your Skills\n“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing,” said Buffett. Education and skill development are lifelong pursuits. Millionaires continually learn to expand their knowledge, abilities and opportunities.\nPractice Intentional Goal Setting\nMillionaires set clear goals for their money and review them regularly. Intentional goal setting and tracking progress are keys to success. “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work,” said American tycoon H. L. Hunt.\nLaura Beck contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nPocket an Extra $403 Per Month With This Simple Hack I Grew Up Poor: Here Are 8 Things I Never Waste Money On Experts: Make These 7 Money Resolutions If You Want To Become Rich on an Average Salary The 7 Worst Things You Can Do If You Owe the IRS",

    "text": "The [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.geneseo.edu/physics) at SUNY Geneseo was recently awarded a letter of commendation from the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) for its \"outstanding contributions to the education of future physics teachers.\" As noted in the commendation, Geneseo graduated five highly qualified physics teachers between the 2020–21 and 2022–23 academic years. Graduating more than five physics teachers in three years puts Geneseo in the top 10% of all non-doctoral physics degree-granting US colleges and universities. Geneseo has earned membership in the 5+ Club, the highest award available for teacher preparation from the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC), an NSF-funded joint project of APS and AAPT. [Distinguished Teaching Professor Kurt Fletcher](https://www.geneseo.edu/fletcher) heads Geneseo's PhysTEC program, which aims to increase the number of qualified high school physics teachers. According to the APS and AAPT, the US has a severe shortage of qualified physics teachers. In 2013, the National Task Force on Teacher Education in Physics reported that \"the need for qualified teachers is greater now than at any previous time in history.\" Of the approximately 1,400 new physics teachers who are hired each year in the US, only 35% have a degree in physics or physics education, according to the American Institute of Physics. \"The State University of New York College at Geneseo's excellent physics teacher preparation program and efforts to address this critical shortage are a service to the state of New York,\" said Young-Kee Kim and Duane Merrel, presidents of APS and AAPT, respectively. \"We congratulate State University of New York College at Geneseo for its excellence in physics teacher education and for serving as a national model for STEM teacher preparation.\"",

    "text": "Президент США Дональд Трамп может быть болен деменцией. К такому выводу пришли журналисты после его ответа по поводу содержания мигрантов в центре «Аллигаторовый Алькатрас», передает британский таблоид Daily Star.\n«Недавние высказывания Дональда Трампа вновь вызвали опасения по поводу его психического здоровья, поскольку он, по-видимому, назвал себя “заключенным” и заявил, что ему предстоит провести “много времени” в новой тюрьме “Аллигаторовый Алькатрас”, — говорится в сообщении.\nВидеозапись со странным ответом Трампа мгновенно разлетелась по соцсетям. Пользователи стали выдвигать свои версии по поводу здоровья хозяина Белого дома, предполагая нарушение когнитивных способностей.\nТрамп в минувший вторник побывал в новой центре для содержания мигрантов во Флориде, который и носит название «Аллигаторовый Алькатрас». Он предусматривает размещение до 5 тысяч человек.\nРанее «МК» писал, что президент США Дональд Трамп постепенно превращается в своего предшественника Джо Байдена из-за втягивания Америки в новый военный конфликт.",
