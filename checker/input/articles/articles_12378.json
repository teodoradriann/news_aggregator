    "text": "( MENAFN - Daily News Egypt) The South African government has warned its citizens that they could face prosecution at home if they join the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) to fight in Gaza, where President Cyril Ramaphosa has accused Israel of committing“genocide” against the Palestinians.\nThe foreign ministry said it was“gravely concerned” by reports that some South Africans have joined or are planning to join the IDF in the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n“Such action could potentially violate international law and amount to further international crimes, making them liable for prosecution in South Africa,” the ministry said.\nThe ministry said that South Africans need prior government approval to legally fight in Israel. It also said that naturalised citizens risk losing their South African nationality if they engage in a war that the country“does not support or agree with”.\nSouth Africa has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often comparing it to its own struggle against apartheid. It has strongly condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza, which have killed more than 10,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has also recalled all its diplomats from Israel. On Monday, Ramaphosa denounced the“genocidal onslaught and slaughter of the people of Palestine” at a press conference with pro-Palestinian groups in Johannesburg.\nMENAFN28122023000153011029ID1107666107\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren - Victoria Times Colonist",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters A Russian appeal against the decision to strip them of the figure skating team gold medal at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics was dismissed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Thursday.\nCAS banned teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva in January for four years for doping, effective from December 2021, a decision that also stripped the Russian Olympic Committee of its gold medal in the team event at the 2022 Games, nearly two years after the competition.\n The ROC, the skaters involved in the team event and the country's figure skating federation had appealed that ruling.\n\"The Appellants had sought a ruling from CAS re-ranking the figure skating Team Event and awarding the gold medal to the ROC,\" CAS said in a statement.\n\"Following the hearing that took place on 12 June 2024, the Panel deliberated and concluded that the results of Ms Valieva in the Olympic figure skating team event were correctly disqualified in the Challenged Decision, and that the ROC skating Team could not be awarded the gold medal.\"\nThe ROC, in a statement, said it was \"extremely disappointed\" by the ruling and was \"considering the possibility of further steps to defend the rights and interests of Russian athletes\".\n\"We harboured no illusions over this matter as has been the case in similar cases and appeals launched by the Russian side over nearly three years,\" the statement said.\nValieva had tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a drug used to treat angina, at the Russian national championships in December 2021. The result was made known only after she competed in the team event in Beijing, triggering a media frenzy.\nHer team had said at the time that the positive test could have been due to a mix-up with her grandfather's heart medication. She was 15 years old at the time.\nIn its revision of the Beijing results, the International Skating Union demoted the Russian figure skating team from gold to bronze after Valieva's disqualification. United States were awarded the gold medal and Japan won silver.\nThe doping charge against the young athlete stirred strong emotions in Russia.\nCanada who finished in fourth place, have also appealed to CAS wanting to be awarded the bronze medal that went to the Russian team.\nRussia, and before it the Soviet Union, have long regarded the Olympics as a chance to showcase the country as a winner on the global stage.\nBut doping controversies in the past decade have soured Moscow's relations with the International Olympic Committee and forced its athletes to compete at successive Games without their national flag or anthem.\nA limited number of Russian athletes are competing as independent athletes without flag or anthem at the Paris Olympics following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nTHE OLYMPICS, 2024",

    "title": "“They requested for it” – M’sian Actress Makes Durian Dessert for Her Australian Husband & Family on Christmas",
    "text": "Local dishes that go well with our taste buds may be something bizarre to foreigners, especially those who have never tried or heard of the dishes. A Malaysian actress & model’s attempt to cook a durian dish for her Australian in-laws, however, was a HUGE success.\nThe actress, Raja Ilya spent this year’s Christmas in Australia with her husband, Trent, and his family. Ilya wanted to contribute by cooking up a storm, so he asked Trent about what he had in mind, who told Ilya he wanted Pengat Durian – a popular creamy durian dessert in Malaysia.\nIlya did not foresee the “thorny” request. She was surprised and at the same time, she was worried that she couldn’t prepare a successful version of Pengat Durian. Nevertheless, she tried.\n“I was worried this might be my last time spending Christmas with Trent’s mother. I might get banned next year if I fail at preparing the sweet treat,” Ilya said.\nDespite the last-minute request, Ilya tried to make it happen, and she started by video calling her mum and sister back at home for tips and guidance. Fortunately for Ilya, she managed to find the ingredients in Australia.\n“I found frozen D24 durians and palm sugar at an Asian store here, thank God.”\nIlya made do with what she had and to her surprise, her Pengat Durian was not only a success but her in-laws were HUGE fans of the dessert. They finished the Pengat Durian and did not spare a single drop.\n“Not only Trent but my brother-in-law finished the dessert. I was relieved. Thank goodness my dessert was a success,” Ilya expressed in her Instagram reel\n[@rajailya.]\nThis was Ilya’s 5th year of spending Christmas at her in-laws in Australia where she spent the festive season helping to wrap the gifts, decorate the house, and even build a mini playground for the kids.\nFood is a language that brings everyone together by tasting and discovering the meal. It’s always an achievement when we manage to “upsell” our local dishes to the foreigners, and make them fall in love with the food.\nAlso read:\nM’sian Sells Budget Rice in PJ for RM3.50 But Gives Away for FREE to Those Who Can’t Afford to Pay",

    "text": "Miami: Garcia va retrouver Swiatek\nPublié le , mis à jour le\nCe mercredi, la Française Caroline Garcia a obtenu son ticket pour le deuxième tour à Miami, où elle retrouvera la Polonaise Iga Swiatek.\nCaroline Garcia passe un tour. Ce mercredi, la Française, 74eme joueuse mondiale, a validé son ticket pour le deuxième tour du tournoi WTA 1000 de Miami aux Etats-Unis, sur dur, après sa victoire contre la Hongroise Anna Bondar, 94eme joueuse mondiale et issue des qualifications, en deux manches (6-0, 7-6 (5)) et 1h49 de jeu. Dans la première manche, la Française s'y est reprise à deux fois avant de réussir le break d'entrée, avant un double-break blanc puis un ultime break, pour réussir cette roue de bicyclette et mener une manche à zéro (6-0).\nDans la deuxième manche, à 1-1, la Tricolore a été breakée blanc, avant de réussir le débreak, dans la foulée, à sa troisième opportunité. A 3-3, Caroline Garcia a, à nouveau, cédé une mise en jeu. A 5-4, la Hongroise a servi pour égaliser à une manche partout. Au lieu de conclure, Anna Bondar a fini par se faire débreaker. Dans la foulée, la 94eme joueuse mondiale a eu trois opportunités pour prendre un nouveau service à son adversaire du jour, qui a parfaitement résisté.\nLes deux joueuses ont ensuite disputé un tie-break. Ce jeu décisif a été équilibré, mais conclu par la 74eme joueuse mondiale, sur sa toute première balle de match (7-6 (5)). Lors du deuxième tour, la Française retrouvera la Polonaise Iga Swiatek, 2eme joueuse mondiale et exempté du premier tour en sa qualité de tête de série n°2.
