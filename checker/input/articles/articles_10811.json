    "title": "Northern lights in NYC: Why colors were so rare – NBC New York",
    "text": "New York Will northern lights be visible again tonight? The rare phenomenon was captured in dazzling photos across the tri-state Thursday By Lauren Maroney and Chris Glorioso • Published 1 hour ago • Updated 55 mins ago NBC Universal, Inc. In the tri-state, it will be calm, beautiful weather on the ground this weekend. But up in space? It’s another story.\nThose who were out Thursday evening and happened sneak a peek up at the northern sky may have found themselves staring up at a rare geomagnetic phenomenon: the aurora borealis or, as it is more commonly called, the northern lights.\nBut will they be visible again Friday night? Here's what to know:\n24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are\nWhat causes the northern lights? The northern lights, generally thought of as an arctic phenomenon, occur as a result of geomagnetic storms. During these storms, solar winds interact with Earth’s magnetic field.\nThe winds trigger electrons in the magnetosphere to collide with molecules in the upper atmosphere, producing light. But the strength and scope of this light can vary wildly.\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. For a brighter, more expansive display of light, you’ll need a particularly strong geomagnetic storm. And thanks to a coronal mass ejection (CME) that erupted from the sun earlier this week, that is precisely what we got when it arrived at Earth on Thursday.\nLocal\nBrooklyn 3 mins ago Speeding red light driver sends Brooklyn man in crosswalk flying to his death Newark Airport 59 mins ago Newark Airport experiencing flight delays due to ‘equipment issue' Geomagnetic storms, like any other major storm system, are graded on a scale to communicate their severity: from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). Thursday’s storm, at its peak, was considered a G4 (severe).\nWhile the scale references a myriad of impacts a geomagnetic storm can have, one of these is its corresponding Kp index, which measures how far south the aurora can reach. For a G4 storm, the Kp index is an 8, suggesting an aurora that extended well into New Jersey.\nWhy was the sky so red/pink Thursday night? Thursday’s aurora managed to be particularly striking, not just because of how far south it could be seen, but also because of its color. The color of an aurora can vary depending on the type of molecules the electrons collide with and at what altitude they collide.\nThe most common color for the northern lights is green. Green indicates that the electrons collided primarily with oxygen atoms anywhere between 80 and 250 miles above the surface. Contrary to most of the atmosphere, where nitrogen is the most abundant gas, in the upper layer of the atmosphere where these interactions take place, the thermosphere, oxygen is more common. The relative availability of oxygen atoms combined with the wide range of potential altitudes makes green the color most frequently seen and associated with the northern lights.\nBut green is not the color most people saw Thursday night. Thursday’s aurora was red.\nSimilar to green, red also comes about from collisions with oxygen. But unlike green, red only occurs when these collisions happen more than 180 miles above the earth’s surface, more than double the minimum threshold for green. The red aurora requires a significantly higher altitude because it needs much thinner air for its color to show through.\nHowever, because it only exists at such high altitudes, a red aurora can be seen further south than green can. This is likely why there were reports of people as far south as Alabama, Mississippi and Texas catching a glimpse of the lights.\nWhile perhaps not quite as bright as places further north, the phenomenon was quite visible in Queens, as well as New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island. Also, sky conditions were near-perfect for viewing.\nCheck out some of the best photos below.\nPHOTOS: Northern lights dazzle in NYC and around the tri-state Will the northern lights be visible again Friday? Sadly, the impacts of Thursday’s severe geomagnetic storm have greatly diminished and it is increasingly unlikely our area will get to see the northern lights on Friday.\nBut the storm is not completely over and there are still parts of the United States where the aurora will be visible. Here's a look at where the aurora borealis will be visible tonight, compared to last night:\nExperts are forecasting the view line to go through parts of upstate New York and northern New England, so if you really want to try to see the aurora, there’s still a chance if you’re willing to head north. Way north, like pretty much to Canada.\nBut if you can’t, you’ll have to wait until the next time a geomagnetic storm illuminate our skies. There is a chance it could happen again: The kind of solar activity we’re experiencing right now has spiked in recent months.\nBack in May, a series of massive flares from the sun produced a solar wind that resulted in gorgeous colors that were also visible in tri-state backyards, much further south than normal.\nAs for the sun, scientists have predicted that it is around the peak of its magnetic cycle, which means it could continue producing additional large solar flares. That would lead to parts of the U.S. continuing to see similarly gorgeous skies like the ones seen Thursday in the months to come.\nBeyond the beauty, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned solar storms like the ones seen Thursday and Friday can disrupt power grids, GPS and radio communications. Thus far, no significant impacts have been reported.\nThis article tagged under: New York Science Extreme Weather on now News 4 New York @ 5PM Trending Stories Broadway Zelig Williams, Broadway dancer in ‘Hamilton' and ‘MJ', is missing in South Carolina Holidays Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day is Monday: What's open and closed?

    "title": "Vietnam welcomes French veterans back to 'hell' of Dien Bien Phu | National",
    "text": "Ninety-year-old French veteran William Schilardi surveys the landscape from the hill where he once fought after a steep climb up a muddy path through heavy rain in Vietnam's Dien Bien Phu. \"Look at the beautiful view... But there are corpses here,\" he said, looking down at the old French trenches still visible beside him. Three French war veterans returned to the site of the bloody conflict ahead of Tuesday's 70th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which unfolded over weeks in 1954 and ultimately brought an end to the French empire in Indochina. Alongside them at the commemorations on May 7 will be France's Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, marking the first time that Vietnam has invited a government minister from the former colonial power to attend official celebrations. French Secretary of State for Veterans and Remembrance Patricia Miralles will also attend. The visit brought back both joyful and difficult memories for Schilardi, Jean-Yves Guinard and Andre Mayer. \"We've remained very attached to this country,\" 92-year-old Guinard told AFP. \"Because it's a country where the people are clever, brave and hard-working.\" \"This does not mean we forget. I come in the name of my fallen comrades.\" The former colonel insisted on walking to the top of Him Lam hill -- known as Beatrice Hill by the French -- on Monday despite the downpour that turned the path slippery. Schilardi recalled the knife and bayonet fights in the trenches dug across the hill, stretching almost from top to bottom. The walk up the hill had brought back memories and intense flashbacks, he said. \"In the trenches, I saw corpses... I can't tell you more\", he said, his throat tightening with emotion. Both men were helped up the hill by Vietnamese soldiers, who held their arms firmly. - 'The sobs, the cries' - Beatrice Hill -- each French strongpoint in Dien Bien Phu bore a female first name -- fell during the first hours of the Viet Minh assault on the mountain outpost in Vietnam's northwest, near the Laos border, launched on March 13, 1954. The colonial forces quickly realised they had underestimated the firepower of their enemies: Viet Minh forces had lugged cannon in pieces through hundreds of kilometres of jungle and across mountains. The 56 days of shelling and direct clashes left 13,000 dead or missing on both sides. More than 3,000 of them were soldiers of different nationalities fighting under the French flag. \"This atmosphere of humidity and rain had deeply penetrated us\" by the time of France's surrender, Schilardi recalled. He said he could hear \"the sobs, the cries\" of the battle as he climbed the hill. Almost 70 percent of the approximately 10,000 men taken prisoner when the French camp fell died as they were marched away from Dien Bien Phu or placed in detention camps. - 'Remarkable welcome' - Residents and tourists crowded around the three veterans pushed in wheelchairs outside the Dien Bien Phu Victory Museum in the centre of the city. A Vietnamese family dressed in the yellow and red of their country's flag posed for a smiling selfie with Guinard. \"The welcome is remarkable!\" Guinard told AFP. Le Tien Bo, a 64-year-old Vietnamese former soldier, pushed through the crowd to shake hands with one of the veterans. \"It's a sign of friendship. They were on the opposite side against us, but it was during war. Today, they are welcome in Vietnam,\" he said. Schilardi and Guinard said they looked forward to reconciliation with a country they still hold in their hearts. Both worked in organisations that tried to build bridges between the youth of the two nations after the war. But it was impossible for them to forget those who fell at Dien Bien Phu. \"It has taken me my whole life to understand what I lived through,\" said Schilardi. \"It was hell.\" ah-tmh/aph/rbu/pbt",

    "title": "Why Has Biden's $42 Billion Broadband Program Not Connected One Single Household?",
    "text": "One of President Joe Biden's pledges upon entering office in 2021 was to expand Americans' access to high-speed broadband internet. But despite apportioning tens of billions of dollars to the task, not one person has been connected to the internet as a result of the initiative.\nContained within the 2021 infrastructure bill , the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program authorized more than $42 billion in grants, to \"connect everyone in America to reliable, affordable high-speed internet by the end of the decade.\"\n\"In 2021, the Biden Administration got $42.45 billion from Congress to deploy high-speed Internet to millions of Americans,\" Brendan Carr, the senior Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) this month. \"Years later, it has not connected even 1 person with those funds. In fact, it now says that no construction projects will even start until 2025 at earliest.\"\nBEAD is administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an agency of the Department of Commerce. NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson told lawmakers in May , \"with BEAD, this is really a 2025, 2026, shovels in the ground project.\"\nCarr blames the delay on \"the addition of a substantive wish list of progressive ideas\" to the approval process. In an April 2023 letter to Davidson, 11 Republican U.S. senators warned that \"NTIA's bureaucratic red tape and far-left mandates undermine Congress' intent and would discourage participation from broadband providers while increasing the overall cost of building out broadband networks.\"\nAmong several examples, the senators noted that NTIA's BEAD proposal \"requires subgrantees to prioritize certain segments of the workforce, such as 'individuals with past criminal records' and 'justice-impacted […] participants.'\" The infrastructure law that authorized the program merely required contractors to be \"in compliance with Federal labor and employment laws.\"\nThe previous year, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Republican senators warned that the NTIA's proposed BEAD rollout \"creates a complex, nine-step, 'iterative' structure and review process that is likely to mire State broadband offices in excessive bureaucracy and delay connecting unserved and underserved Americans as quickly as possible.\"\nIn practice, this is exactly what's happening: Multiple representatives from the telecommunications industry told MinnPost this week that they had no interest in applying for a piece of Minnesota's $652 million in BEAD grants. Brent Christensen, president and CEO of Minnesota Telecom Alliance, which represents 70 Minnesota telecom companies, said, \"None of them would bid for the federal grants because of the regulations that would come with it—especially the requirement to provide low-cost services to low-income households in exchange for grants that would allow internet providers to build out their networks.\"\nMinnPost noted that new state laws also \"requir[e] companies who receive state grants to pay workers a 'prevailing wage,' a basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers in a particular occupation.\" Since the federal government's prevailing wage list does not include telecom workers, \"companies in Minnesota would have to pay more because they would have to use a similar, but higher-paying, classification.\"\n\"It's becoming clear that it might be too risky to participate in the program,\" Melissa Wolf, executive director of the Minnesota Cable Communications Association, told the outlet.\nFortunately, the private sector is expanding access to broadband on its own: This year, the FCC raised the standard for which it considers \"broadband\" to 100 Mbps download speeds and 20 Mbps upload speeds, up from its previous standard of 25Mbps download and three Mbps upload.\n\"Nearly 88 percent of households already live where at least two competitors offer 25/3 Mbps service, and 85 percent lived where at least one operator offers 100/20 Mbps service and a competitor offers 25/3 Mbps service,\" Reason 's Ronald Bailey wrote last year , citing an industry group report. \"On current trends, the [group] projects that 95 percent will have access to at least 100/20 Mbps service by 2025.\"\nAccording to the OpenVault Broadband Insights report for the first quarter of 2024, 90 percent of all current broadband subscribers have download speeds of at least 100 Mbps already, while \"the percentage of subscribers provisioned for speeds below 200 Mbps has declined by 31% year over year, and is down 63% from where it was just three years ago.\"\nThese advances came from the private sector, without the added expense of $42 billion in taxpayer money. Satellite internet provider Starlink, which is part of SpaceX, claims that its users \"typically experience download speeds between 25 and 220 Mbps, with a majority of users experiencing speeds over 100 Mbps.\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk approvingly reposted an X user who claimed that \"for $42 billion they could have bought Starlink dishes for 140 million people.\"",

    "text": "All News 18:41 August 02, 2024 SEOUL, Aug. 2 (Yonhap) -- Severe heat caused the cancellation of a South Korean baseball game Friday. The Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) said the regular-season game between the LG Twins and the Lotte Giants scheduled in the southeastern city of Ulsan was scrapped due to extreme heat. This marks the first game in the KBO's 42-year history to be canceled because of heat wave. Per KBO regulations, games may be canceled in cities where the highest daily temperature has reached 35 C for at least two consecutive days. Ulsan, about 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, has been under a heat wave advisory for the past 14 straight days. Friday's game was to have been played at Munsu Baseball Stadium, a secondary home for the Giants, who are based in the nearby city of Busan. A KBO official said the temperature on the field level at Munsu, which has artificial grass, reached nearly 50 C. jeeho@yna.co.kr (END) - (Olympics) S. Korea introduced as N.

    "text": "Petizione per il servizio di emergenza 118 medicalizzato nell’Alto Frignano\nSanità sempre in primo piano in Appennino , tra preoccupazioni (già oltre 2700 firme alla petizione per mantenere il medico del 118) e conferme (il ritorno del servizio d’assistenza medica estiva per i turisti). Dopo tre giorni dal lancio, ieri pomeriggio erano state superate le 2.700 ‘firme verificate’ alla petizione digitale (su www.change.org) che chiede \"il mantenimento immediato del servizio di emergenza 118 medicalizzato nell’Alto Frignano con la costruzione di un piano credibile, condiviso con rappresentanze dei professionisti e amministratori locali, formalmente approvato. Nell’ambito della vertenza tra Snami Emilia Romagna - Modena e Azienda Usl di Modena, chiediamo con urgenza di non interrompere e anzi stabilizzare definitivamente la presenza del mezzo di soccorso avanzato con medico e infermiere 118 nell’Alto Frignano (Fanano, Pievepelago, Riolunato etc.) interrotto dal 1° luglio 2025 senza alcuna reale alternativa garantita\".\nDal canto proprio l’Azienda rassicura rispetto alla distribuzione dei mezzi di soccorso avanzato grazie alla presenza di 3 mezzi avanzati con infermiere h 24 e uno h12, un’automedica in grado di intervenire su tutto il territorio e il servizio di elisoccorso: non vi è alcuna riduzione dei livelli di garanzia e sicurezza territoriale che si possono definire ben superiori ai riferimenti nazionali.\nIntanto, grazie alla disponibilità dei Medici di Medicina Generale nei comuni montani modenesi è stato attivato sino al 31 agosto il Servizio estivo di assistenza medico-generica per turisti italiani e stranieri e lavoratori stagionali, assicurando interventi medici ambulatoriali e a domicilio, nei centri montani di Guiglia, Zocca, Montese, Pavullo, Polinago, Lama Mocogno, Serramazzoni, Fanano, Sestola, Montecreto, Pievepelago, Riolunato, Fiumalbo, Frassinoro, Palagano, Prignano sulla Secchia e Montefiorino.\nPer accedere occorre rispettare le indicazioni di visita di ciascun ambulatorio medico, diffuse nei luoghi di villeggiatura dei vari comuni e sul sito Ausl ( https://www.ausl.mo.it/strutture/guardia-medica-turistica-sedi/ ). La tariffa applicata è di 20 euro per la visita ambulatoriale e 35 euro per la visita domiciliare.\nPer l’assistenza notturna, prefestiva e festiva il riferimento anche per i turisti è il Servizio di continuità assistenziale (guardia medica) presente nelle varie sedi sul territorio, cui si accede preferibilmente telefonando all’800 032 032 (attivo tutte le notti ore 20 - 8; sabato, domenica, prefestivi e festivi ore 8 - 20): il medico valuterà se invitare il paziente in ambulatorio o se recarsi al domicilio, oppure, in molti casi, potrà risolvere direttamente al telefono il bisogno del cittadino.\ng.p.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo\nAssistenza sanitaria",

    "text": "CNN commentator Adam Kinzinger said Thursday on CNN’s “News Central” that voters “brainwashed” by former President Donald Trump needed to hear the “truth” from 2024 GOP hopeful former Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ).\nIn a campaign ad, Christie said, “Some people say I should drop out of this race. Really? I’m the only one saying Donald Trump is a liar. He puts Americans against each other. His Christmas message to anyone who disagrees with him, rot in hell. He caused a riot on Capital Hill, he will burn America to the ground to help himself. Every Republican leader says that in private, I’m the only one saying it in public.”\nCo-host Boris Sanchez said, “Chris Christie has effectively backed off of Iowa in that race but not in New Hampshire where he stands the best chance. How close does the race need to be between him and Donald Trump for him to stay in?”\nKinzinger said, “It’s his decision, I have not endorsed him but we thought it was important, through my group, to make sure he’s on the ballot, he has access to the debates because he’s the only one telling the truth just like his ad said. I thought that was effective. If there should be pressure on anybody to drop out, frankly it is Ron DeSantis. I forget he’s in the race anymore. I think Chris Christie will stay in because he’s right, he’s the one telling the truth, he’s doing it aggressively.”\nHe added, “He occupies a unique lane that there’s frankly many of us in the party or used to be in the party need to hear from, and frankly people that are brainwashed need to hear from.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n2024 Election Clips Politics 2024 Presidential Election Adam Kinzinger Chris Christie Donald Trump MAGA",

    "title": "L’Observatori Fabra viu un dels dies més càlids registrats mai un mes de març",
    "text": "La calor desmesurada d’aquest divendres té ben pocs precedents en el mes de març. De fet, en el cas de l’Observatori Fabra, amb més de 100 anys de dades, aquest divendres és un dels dies més càlids registrats mai un mes de març, tot i que lluny del rècord absolut de temperatura màxima.\nLa mínima podria igualar el rècord absolut\nLa que és més a prop del rècord absolut és, de moment i de forma provisional, la temperatura mínima, que ha quedat en 16,4 ºC i que, si no baixa d’aquesta marca abans de la una de la matinada, haurà igualat el rècord absolut de temperatura mínima més alta registrada a l’Observatori un mes de març.\n|21/03/1990||16,4 ºC|\n|22/03/2024||16,4 ºC (provisional)|\n|24/03/2001||16,3 ºC|\n|22/03/2001||16,2 ºC|\n|mitjana del març 1991-2020||7,8 ºC|\n|mitjana del juny 1991-2020||16,9 ºC|\nLa dada no és pas menor, i constitueix un registre molt més propi de mitjans de juny més que no pas de finals de març.\nNomés tres màximes superiors a la d’avui\nEn el cas de les màximes, tot i els més de 25ºC registrats provisionalment aquest divendres són una dada realment elevada, el cert és que trobem encara tres dies de març amb temperatures màximes més altes i amb puntes de calor molt més intenses que no pas aquest divendres.\n|23/03/2001||27,9 ºC|\n|21/03/1990||26,8 ºC|\n|24/03/2023||25,7 ºC|\n|22/03/2024||25,3 ºC (provisional)|\n|mitjana del març 1991-2020||15,6 ºC|\n|mitjana del juny 1991-2020||25,7 ºC|\nD’aquesta manera, la màxima provisional d’aquest divendres (25,3 ºC) quedarà molt lluny del rècord absolut del 23 de març del 2001, quan es van assolir gairebé 28 ºC a l’Observatori Fabra (27,9 ºC). El valor d’aquest divendres, igualment, és molt més propi de mitjans de juny que de finals de març.\nAl podi en temperatura mitjana i gairebé 10ºC per sobre del que seria habitual\nI si fem en còmput global la temperatura mitjana provisional del dia, trobarem que els 20,85 ºC registrats provisionalment aquest divendres entrarien al podi dels dies més càlids registrats un mes de març en els darrers 110 anys.\n|21/03/1990||21,6 ºC|\n|23/03/2001||21,0 ºC|\n|22/04/2024||20,85 ºC (provisional)|\n|22/03/2001||20,6 ºC|\n|mitjana del març 1991-2020||11,7 ºC|\n|mitjana del juny 1991-2020||21,3 ºC|\nEl dia més càlid, en temperatura mitjana, continua sent el 21 de març del 1990, amb una màxima de 26,8 ºC i una mínima clavada a la que hem tingut provisionalment aquest divendres: 16,4 ºC.\nD’aquesta manera, amb les dades d’aquest divendres, la temperatura mitjana diària quedarà gairebé 9 ºC per sobre del que seria habitual. Una autèntica barbaritat a la qual, malauradament, ens estem acostumant darrerament. Gener i febrer, en aquest sentit, també van tenir dies amb anomalies semblants.",
