    "title": "About 100 rescued elephants escape flash floods at popular sanctuary in northern Thailand | Lifestyle | kxly.com",
    "text": "Bangkok (CNN) — Flash floods swept through a popular elephant sanctuary in northern Thailand on Thursday, forcing the evacuation of about 100 elephants and trapping dozens of tourists, amid urgent pleas for help. Dramatic video and images from the [Elephant Nature Park](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/) near the city of Chiang Mai showed dozens of elephants wading through belly-deep water to find safety on higher ground. “It was the biggest evacuation we have ever done to save their lives, the water rose rapidly,” Saengduean “Lek” Chailert, founder of Elephant Nature Park, told CNN, calling the floods the most severe the park has ever experienced. Video showed park staff who work with elephants, known as mahouts, shouting, “Go go, keep going” as they urged the huge pachyderms out of their pens and through the high floodwaters. While many of the animals found shelter on a nearby mountain overnight Thursday, come morning, Saengduean said the danger was far from over. “There are some animals we could not evacuate yesterday. Thirteen adult elephants are still trapped in their quarters. They are panicking,” said Saengduean. Northern Thailand has suffered severe flooding and landslides in recent weeks due to torrential rains brought by Typhoon Yagi, Asia’s most powerful storm this year, which left dozens dead as it swept across the region in mid-September. Authorities in Chaing Mai, a popular tourist destination in Thailand, have issued alerts for potential flooding as water levels along the Ping River, which runs through the city, reach dangerous levels. With extensive flooding around the park and waters still rising, the sanctuary’s founder said they are facing the unwelcome prospect of having to evacuate the animals a second time. “The situation is a lot worse than yesterday,” she said, adding that she has requested urgent help from Thai authorities. A priority is getting hold of boats so the mahouts can stay with the remaining elephants at the park to keep them calm, she said. “We urgently need volunteers and animal cages as we must move the animals to the mountains due to the roads being completely cut off in both directions,” the park said in a post on Facebook. About 30 foreign volunteers are also trapped at the sanctuary, including five Americans, some of whom have been working at the park for several weeks, Saengduean said. The [Elephant Nature Park](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/elephant-nature-park-chiang-mai/index.html) is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center in the Chiang Mai countryside that has rescued more than 200 elephants from the tourism and logging industries since its inception in the 1990s. It also runs tours and volunteering programs that allow visitors to observe the animals or help with conservation work. Many of the elephants are blind or have physical injuries, which have hindered their ability to escape and complicated evacuation efforts. “Among the evacuated animals, there are many sick elephants, some barely walk. We had to help them to get to the foot of the mountain. We are in desperate need for help,” Saengduean said. As well as elephants, the park is home to about 5,000 rescued animals including dogs, cats, horses, pigs and rabbits – some of which were evacuated in recent days after authorities issued a flood warning. Several villages in Chiang Mai’s Mae Rim district have been inundated by water from upstream runoffs, local media reported Thursday. Elephants, Thailand’s national animal, have seen their wild population decline in recent decades due to threats from tourism, logging, poaching and human encroachment on elephant habitats. Experts estimate the wild elephant population in Thailand has dwindled to 3,000-4,000, a decline from more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century.

    "text": "Elle King reschedules these shows after backlash to 'hammered' Dolly Parton tribute appearance [Diana Leyva](https://www.tennessean.com/staff/11426079002/diana-leyva/) Elle King has rescheduled a series of shows following her [controversial performance during Dolly Parton's birthday tribute](/story/entertainment/music/2024/01/22/grand-old-opry-apology-elle-king-dolly-parton-birthday-nashville/72309986007/) at the Ryman Auditorium earlier this month. The singer-songwriter and daughter of actor-comedian Rob Schneider, has faced much criticism for what some fans have called a \"lackluster\" performance. What was supposed to a family-friendly program, turned into a chaotic, \"hammered\" performance as the \"Ex's and Oh's\" singer admitted to being under the influence, not knowing the lyrics to Parton's, \"Marry Me,\" and frequently cursed throughout the evening. \"I'll tell you one thing more … Hi, my name is Elle King. I'm (expletive) hammered,\" she said onstage. \"I don't know the lyrics to these things in this (expletive) town/Don't tell Dolly 'cause it's her birthday.\" She continued. \"I'm not even gonna (expletive) lie … y'all bought tickets for this (expletive), you ain't getting your money back.\" King's performance prompted [an apology from the Grand Ole Opry](https://twitter.com/opry/status/1748781674521895343) on social media after many fans expressed their disappointment. \"Hi Judas, we deeply regret and apologize for the language that was used during last night’s second Opry performance,\" said the Ryman in a post to X on Jan. 20. Neither King or Parton have commented about the performance. What shows did Elle King reschedule? In an [Instagram story](https://www.instagram.com/elleking/?igsh=M2ZoN3BydHJ4YmEz), King announced a total of 5 rescheduled shows. King's concerts on Feb. 23 and 24 at [Island Resort and Casino](https://www.islandresortandcasino.com/) in Harris, Michigan, have been moved to March 29 and 30, \"due to an unforeseen circumstance,\" according to a news release Thursday from the casino. On Wednesday, Billy Bob's Texas announced that the Fort Worth show set to take place on Friday would be rescheduled to Sept. 21. The venue did not provide a reason for the last-minute cancelation. \"Original event tickets will be accepted for the new date. Refunds are available at the point of purchase,\" said the venue in a post to Instagram. \"Thank you for your understanding!\" Shows in Shipshewana, Ind. and Waukegan, Ill. were also postponed.

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Clear guidelines and efficient registration processes are crucial to ensure all fire safety professionals can adhere to regulations under the amended Fire Services Act 1988, say interest groups.\nAcknowledging the amendments as a positive step towards improving the national fire safety ecosystem, these groups are calling for a transparent and marketdriven rollout to avoid potential monopolies.\nMalaysian Fire Protection Association president Tee Siew Chong said the amendments are a positive step in ensuring competency, credibility and quality assurance in the industry.\n“It establishes a structured and accountable fire safety ecosystem and ensures public safety by better regulating fire protection services,” Tee said.\nHowever, the one-year transition period for registration could prove to be challenging for existing service providers, he said.\n“We hope for a fair and practical rollout. Clear guidelines and smooth enforcement are needed.\n“Compliance costs and bureaucratic processes should be manageable, especially for smaller firms,” he said, urging adequate regulatory support and enforcement mechanisms.\nTee also urged continuous efforts towards improving fire safety in Malaysia.\n“We want a fire safety culture that prioritises prevention, preparedness and innovation,” he said.\nA seasoned industry player, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, called for clear and detailed guidelines on the registration process.\n“There must be sufficient service providers registered to avoid any monopoly.\n“The process must be transparent. Any qualified professionals should be allowed to register.\n“We support this move to enhance the fire safety ecosystem but there must be proper implementation. We don’t want this to end just on paper,” he said.\nReal Estate and Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia president Datuk Ho Hon Sang said a market-driven implementation must be carried out to avoid a monopoly.\nHe also acknowledged that the amendments help uphold quality standards.\nTo prevent a single product or company from monopolising the market, Ho said a sufficient number of fire safety-related professionals and service providers must be registered once the amendments come into effect.\n“There must also be measures to encourage more registrations by related companies and service providers,” he said.\nHo added that registration criteria must not be overly restrictive, which could then lead to a small number of registrations.\n“This could result in delays and a rush to meet market demand.\n“Overly specific requirements may also impede innovation, which is necessary to ensure that the industry remains competitive and futureproof,” Ho said, adding that the amendment’s impact on the housing industry would only be clearer a few months after its implementation.\nMalaysian Federation for Occupational Safety and Health chairman Dr Abu Hasan Samad said the amendments were relevant and timely given the rapid development of Malaysian industries and properties.\nHe said the amendments were similar to the Medical Act 1971, which governed doctors, as well as the Medical Device Act that regulates medical equipment.\n“The Fire and Rescue Department is moving in the right direction here by regulating these aspects, enhancing the impact of the country’s fire safety blanket,” he said.\nHe said the one-year grace period offered for service providers to register with the Fire and Rescue is also sufficient.\n“There should be no compromise when it comes to the safety and health of people,” he added.\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

    "text": "The NATO air base in the German town of Geilenkirchen has raised its security level &quot;based on intelligence information indicating a potential threat,&quot; it said late on Thursday. &quot;All non-mission essential staff have been sent home as a precautionary measure,&quot; the base said in a statement on the social media platform X, without giving details. &quot;The safety of our staff is our top priority. Operations continue as planned.&quot; A spokesperson for the base in Geilenkirchen said the threat level had been raised to Charlie, the second-highest of four states of alert, which is defined as &quot;an incident (that) has occurred or intelligence has been received indicating that some form of terrorist action against NATO organisations or personnel is highly likely&quot;. It was the second time the base housing NATO's fleet of AWACS surveillance planes raised the security level after an incident last week when a military base in nearby Cologne was temporarily sealed off as authorities investigated possible sabotage of the water supply. The same day, the base in Geilenkirchen also reported an attempted trespassing incident that prompted a full sweep of the premises. With regard to the suspected sabotage at the base in Cologne, the German military later gave the all-clear, saying test results had shown that the tap water was not contaminated. NATO has warned in the past of a campaign of hostile activities staged by Russia, including acts of sabotage and cyberattacks. Russia has regularly accused NATO of threatening its security. In June, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance saw a pattern evolving and that recent attacks were a result of Russian intelligence becoming more active. Several incidents on NATO territory have been treated as suspicious by analysts in recent years, among them the severance of a vital undersea cable connecting Svalbard to mainland Norway in 2022.\",",

El cielo plomizo puso su nota de melancolía en el emotivo acto de recordación del hundimiento del Crucero ARA General Belgrano. La ceremonia se desarrolló en torno al mástil de Plaza Independencia y contó con la presencia de la intendente Paula Mitre, integrantes del gabinete y Concejo Municipal, los excombatientes Oscar Oliva, Gustavo Díaz y Gustavo Schultz, familiares del soldado Alcides Gómez, integrante de la tripulación y fallecido en la tragedia. Además estuvieron en el acto representantes de la “Asociación Civil Tte. Cnel. Juan P. Jobson”, encargada del Museo de la Ciudad, el jefe y subjefe de la Unidad Regional XIX, Ariel Monje y Darío Lacuadra. Fiel a la costumbre, no hubo oradores y la intendente Mitre, junto los excombatientes y funcionarios policiales, procedieron a izar la Bandera a media asta, al tiempo que las unidades policiales hacían sonar sus sirenas exactamente a las 16, hora de producirse el ataque hace 42 años.

    "title": "Viele Windkraftanlagen gefährden Vogelschutz / Studie der Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung liefert besorgniserregende Ergebnisse",
    "text": "Hamburg.\nFür den Klimaschutz sind sie wichtige Werkzeuge, für den Artenschutz eine große Herausforderung: Windkraftanlagen bedrohen mit ihren schweren Rotorblättern insbesondere viele heimische Brutvogelarten. Eine Studie im Auftrag der Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung belegt nun: Vogelschutzgebiete sind in Deutschland erheblich von der Nähe zu Windkraftanlagen betroffen - viele Anlagen stehen sogar innerhalb der Schutzgebietsgrenzen.\nDer Fokus der Studie, die durch das Büro \"Schreiber Umweltplanung\" durchgeführt wurde, lag auf Vogelschutzgebieten auf dem deutschen Festland, die den Schutz mindestens einer sogenannten kollisionsgefährdeten Brutvogelart zum Ziel haben, zum Beispiel Schreiadler, Wiesenweihe oder Rotmilan. Untersucht wurde die Nähe dieser Schutzgebiete zu Windkraftanlagen. Das Ergebnis: Deutschlandweit stehen fast 500 Anlagen innerhalb der Schutzgebietsgrenzen und 60 Prozent aller Vogelschutzgebiete liegen in einem gesetzlich relevanten Prüfbereich von Windkraftanlagen.\nDer Prüfbereich ist im Bundesnaturschutzgesetz festgelegt und definiert je nach Brutvogelart drei unterschiedlich weite Radien um eine Windkraftanlage: den Nahbereich, den zentralen Prüfbereich und den erweiterten Prüfbereich. Befindet sich ein Brutplatz der relevanten Vogelarten in diesen Prüfbereichen, müssen Schutzmaßnahmen ergriffen werden - je näher die Windkraftanlage am Brutplatz steht, umso höher die Auflagen. Im Nahbereich von Windkraftanlagen, der für den Baumfalken laut Gesetz zum Beispiel 350 Meter und für den Schreiadler 1.500 Meter beträgt, müssten die Schutzmaßnahmen eigentlich so umfangreich sein, dass ein wirtschaftlicher Betrieb der Anlage in der Regel nicht mehr möglich wäre. Der Gesetzgeber hat den Umfang der Abschaltauflagen allerdings begrenzt und lässt ausgerechnet im Nahbereich regelmäßig Ausnahmen zu - und nimmt damit das Tötungsrisiko für die Brutvögel in Kauf.\n\"Die Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung begrüßt ausdrücklich den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien, er darf aber nicht auf Kosten des Artenschutzes gehen. Die Dringlichkeit des Biodiversitätsschutzes steht der des Klimaschutzes in nichts nach\", sagt Dr. Andreas Kinser, Leiter Natur- und Artenschutz bei der Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung. \"Die von uns herausgegebene Studie zeigt leider deutlich, dass der Artenschutz beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien häufig untergraben wird.\" Alle 15 vom Gesetzgeber definierten kollisionsgefährdeten Brutvogelarten sind davon betroffen.\nDabei beschreibt die Studie lediglich einen Mindestumfang an Beeinträchtigungen des Artenschutzes durch Windkraft. \"Die aktuellen Vorgaben des Bundesnaturschutzgesetzes lassen viele Arten außer Acht, die ebenfalls negativ durch die Nähe ihrer Brutgebiete zu Windkraftanlagen beeinflusst werden, zum Beispiel Uferschnepfe und Schwarzstorch\", so Kinser. Auch die gesetzlich normierten Prüfbereiche sind viel geringer als die Fachempfehlungen der staatlichen Vogelschutzwarten.\nDie Genehmigungen vieler Windkraftanlagen dürften sich bei einer erneuten Prüfung als rechtswidrig erweisen, da sie nach den Maßstäben des EU-Rechts, die für Vogelschutzgebiete gelten, nicht hätten erteilt werden dürfen. Zugunsten der Rechtssicherheit und des Vertrauensschutzes haben sie aber vermutlich Bestand. Damit Klimaschutz und Artenschutz wieder in Einklang gebracht werden, fordert die Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung für die Windkraftanlagen, die mindestens im zentralen Prüfbereich Flächenanteile von relevanten Vogelschutzgebieten aufweisen, nachträglich Abschaltauflagen zu beschließen. Diese können je nach Tageszeit, dem saisonalen Aufenthaltsort von Zugvogelarten oder dem tatsächlichen Brutvorkommen variieren. \"Langfristig muss das Ziel sein, alle Windkraftanlagen abzubauen, die im Nahbereich Vogelschutzgebiete mit kollisionsgefährdeten Brutvogelarten als Erhaltungszielart aufweisen\", sagt Wildtierbiologe Kinser. Davon betroffen wären knapp zwei Prozent aller in Deutschland errichteten Windkraftanlagen.\nEine Lang- und eine Kurzfassung der Studie sowie Infografiken zu den wichtigsten Ergebnissen finden Sie hier: https://ots.de/NyPOHq .\nPressekontakt: Inga Olfen Pressesprecherin Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung Telefon 040 970 78 69 - 13 I.Olfen@DeutscheWildtierStiftung.de www.DeutscheWildtierStiftung.de\nWeiteres Material: www.presseportal.de Quelle: Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung",
