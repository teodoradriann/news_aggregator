    "title": "Water fights and flying bells: Discover intriguing European Easter traditions | Euronews",
    "text": "In some countries, it's a bigger deal even than Christmas. Easter is a highlight of the Christian calendar. From solemn processions and water fights to TV marathons, Europe is home to some unique Easter traditions – some spiritual and some… less so. If you’re wondering how to get in the Easter spirit, take inspiration from a trip around the continent with Euronews Culture. Watch elaborate Semana Santa parades in Spain Get a move on, celebrations have already started in Spain – Semana Santa (Holy Week) events take place across the entire last week of Lent. Along with treats such as French toast-eque torrijas and mona de Pascua cake, parades are a seasonal staple. Catholic religious brotherhoods – recognisable for their distinctive cloaks and hoods – perform penance processions on the streets of many Spanish cities, with pasos (floats) depicting scenes from the biblical Easter story. Seville is famed for hosting some of Spain's most elaborate processions, but Madrid, Zamora, Valladolid and Granada are also hotspots for anyone wanting to experience Semana Santa. Experience the silence of the bells in France Move over Easter Bunny – in France, it’s the cloches volantes or “flying bells” that bring excited children their Easter treats. Church bells stop ringing around Easter as a sign of respect for Jesus's death, because – so the story goes – they have flown to Rome to be blessed by the Pope, before making a glorious return fully loaded with Easter eggs. On the journey back to their steeples, the bells drop their bounty into families’ gardens, ready for competitive Easter egg hunts to get underway. Prefer your eggs of the savoury variety? Head to the town of Bessières in southwest France, where Easter Monday sees thousands gather to enjoy a 15,000-egg omelette. Take aim in Poland’s Easter water fight Nothing says Easter like aiming a water pistol at your neighbours. At least, that’s the case in Poland, where Śmigus-Dyngus – also known as lany poniedziałek (Wet Monday) – turns Easter Monday into a full-blown national water fight. It’s thought that the tradition goes back to the 14th century, when boys in countryside villages would drench girls with buckets of water as a sign of affections (as questionable as their methods may sound). These days, though, nobody is safe: watch out for sniper-style water balloons from above when walking the streets of Polish cities, attacks by water gun-wielding schoolchildren and even from the hoses of hardworking firefighters. Similar water-based traditions can be found all around Central and Eastern Europe, but Poland takes the festivities to a new level. Try your hand at egg rolling in the UK Why just admire your elaborately decorated egg when you could roll it down a hill? Infuse your Easter with a healthy dose of competition in this centuries-old UK custom, which sees enthusiasts (traditionally children, but why let them have all the fun?) compete to roll their egg the furthest without it breaking. Egg rolling, which is meant to symbolise the stone at the entrance to Jesus’s tomb being rolled away, is also known as “pace-egging”, derived from “Pasch” in Old English which, in turn, comes from the Hebrew for Passover (Pesach). Among the most famous egg rolling events usually takes place at Preston’s Avenham Park on Easter Monday, and this year is no exception. Follow the Epitaphios in Greece As Eastern Orthodox churches use a different calendar from Catholic and Protestant churches to work out what day Easter should fall on, Greece (along with other countries such as Bulgaria) will celebrate Easter this year on 5 May. The sombre procession of the Epitaphios – a recreation of the tomb of Christ, often decorated with flowers – is a staple of Good Friday, before staying up for the midnight mass that ushers in Easter Sunday. Other non-negotiables include preparing colourful dyed eggs, and tucking into roast lamb and tsoureki (sweet easter bread). Enjoy an explosive tradition in Florence, Italy Visitors to Florence might usually have Michelangelo’s David and the Ponte Vecchio on their hitlists, but Easter offers another, more unusual spectacle: the Scoppio del Carro. Meaning the \"explosion of the cart\", the Scoppio del Carro is not for the faint of heart. It has its origins in the First Crusade, when the Florentine Pazzino de' Pazzi – according to legend, at least – became the first man to scale the walls of Jerusalem, taking stone pieces from the Holy Sepulchre back to Florence, which were used to spark the Easter bonfire, carried around Florence in a cart to bring blessing to the city Today, the Easter Sunday event centres around a mammoth antique chariot packed full of fireworks, wheeled onto Duomo Square and set alight with a dove-shaped rocket called a colombina. The \"brindellone\" chariot used today dates back to the 17th century and was designed by the architect and stage designer Bernardo Buontalenti. Binge watch crime drama in Norway You’ve heard of Scandi noir, but how about adding some into your Easter celebrations? During the Easter holidays, many Norwegians retreat to mountain and countryside cabins, with the country largely shutting down over the five-day break. Enter the beloved Easter tradition: Påskekrim, or “Easter crime”. With the weather still chilly in much of Norway, people often bed down for a few days with murder mystery novels or in front of their televisions, with TV schedules packed with crime shows at all hours and bookstores offering special promotions on crime novels. Festive, eh?",

    "text": "Dmitry Bivol wants to fight for the undisputed light heavyweight championship next after successfully defending his WBA 175-lb title against Lyndon Arthur last weekend in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Bivol said he enjoyed the fight with Arthur (23-2, 16 KOs), which at times appeared easy for him, but he backed off in the later rounds instead of going for the knockout. Dmitry had Arthur down in the eleventh from a body shots, but didn’t press the issue. Eyes on the prize Bivol (22-0, 11 KOs) must wait for the outcome of the January 13th fight between IBF/WBC/WBO champion Artur Beterbiev and Callum Smith. “I didn’t expect his speed. In the eighth round? I don’t remember this. Which shot was it?” said Dmitry Bivol to [Matchroom Boxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPUj5-RV4pY) when asked about his appearing to be hurt by a body shot in the eighth round by Lyndon Arthur last Saturday night. Arthur’s power seemed to the thing that bothered Bivol the most in the fight, as he landed some big shots that would back him off. His speed wasn’t the thing that made Bivol cautious. It was the power shots that Lyndon was hitting him with that gave him problems, and he could have done a lot more if he’d attacked aggressively. He created the blueprint in a way that shows what Bivol is uncomfortable with. “I felt comfortable. I even played. Sometimes, it was a situation like, ‘You caught me,’ with that punch, he punched me on my arm, and I showed him, ‘Throw more punches.’ He said it, and he just read in my eyes that it’s a joke,” said Bivol. “I feel fresh, and I want my next fight soon. I want to fight for the undisputed. This is what I hope my next fight I will get. Nothing. It meant nothing to me. Undisputed the Driving Force “We met, and it doesn’t matter. I met him before, and it doesn’t help to make this fight,” said Bivol when asked what he thought of Artur Beterbiev during their face-off during the Tyson Fury vs. Francisco Ngannou fight week last October. Bivol has been working for the undisputed championship for years, and it’s going to be interesting to see what he does if he accomplishes his goal. Will he stay at 175 to defend it for as long as possible, or will he move up to cruiserweight and accept the offer from former IBF champion Jai Opetaia to fight him? Bivol will need to be a lot more aggressive if he wants to beat Opetaia because he’ll lose on the cards if he retreats each time he’s pressured. That’s the reason why Craig Richards gave him so many problems in 2021. Canelo Alvarez would have done the same if he had fought in reactionary mode by hanging back, fighting off the ropes last year. “It could only help if it’s the wishes of His Excellency Turki Al-Sheikh and how they agreed to it with [Beterbiev’s promoters at] Top Rank because, with us, we already agree for the fight,” said Bivol. “When I beat him in 2012, and it was just another opponent from England, and then I saw him many years [later], and he won the Muhammad Ali trophy,” said Bivol about Callum Smith, who is challenging IBF, WBC & WBO light heavyweight champion Beterbiev on January 13th. “When he moved to my weight class, I thought, ‘Yeah, one day I could meet with him again in the ring,’ but it’s just a new page. Nothing from the past will help me or him. “To have all the belts? It’s just that the mission is done,” said Bivol when asked what his thoughts would be if he became the undisputed 175-lb champion by defeating the winner of the Beterbiev vs. Smith fight. “If I get all the belts. I’ve achieved what I wanted. When I’m talking about it, I feel the fire inside of me. I feel happy and sad because when you’re playing some game and you’re done. You’ve won this game. I see that I’m close. We will see,” said Bivol. Beterbiev will be a real problem for Bivol with punching power and his attack mode style of fighting. He’s all wrong for Bivol. A better style match-up for Bivol would be Callum Smith, who wilts under pressure and tends to fall back to the ropes to cover up. We saw him do this against Canelo and John Ryder, and he looked poor in both fights. “I want to say thank you to him [Excellency Turki Al-Sheikh] from me and my team, and from all boxing society,” said Bivol when asked about what his thoughts are on His Excellency for putting the ‘Day of Reckoning’ card together last Saturday night on December 23rd. “It’s a lot because he’s giving to boxing fans good matches and good fights, and I hope he will do it in the future. Thank you so much to Excellency Turki Al-Sheikh and to all of Saudi because it’s great that they’re doing these events, and they want to do it perfect. It’s a standard to how to do it for all of the world to do it. “They try to do it better, and it’s great that His Excellency loves boxing. Thank you so much,” said Bivol.",

    "title": "Friendship as the path to sainthood",
    "text": "One of the most revealing aspects of this portrayal is Jesus as friend, particularly in His friendship with the Apostles. Our Lord is shown to be the greatest friend in always lifting up those around Him, caring for them, calling out the best in them, urging them on to be the saints they are called to be. What He desires most for them is the salvation only He offers. A priest friend of mine once said to me that we must remember that those who come into our lives are there for our salvation. God presents us with opportunities to meet them and in those meetings to see Him, to see His image and likeness, an image and likeness that we too bear. Some of these interactions might be brief, one-off meetings with a kind server in a shop or restaurant, with a homeless person we reach out to or to someone we meet on a train or plane or ferry as we travel. They are fleeting, but offer us an occasion to learn about another person, perhaps to hear about their joys or their struggles, to find a common personhood in them. Other friendships are of a time and place, such as friends that we make in school or in our work. Many of them are more than transactional, they are friendships that help us to integrate into a community where we grow through various experiences, some of which might be very formative indeed. Some of these friendships might last for several years. Yet often as we get older and geographic distance or changing priorities intervene the friendships wane. In their waning, we come to understand that these types of friendships will come and go, that they are part of our lives, and we are thankful for them. Christian, and in our case Catholic, friendships are of another order all together. We must earnestly desire these friendships, seek them out and assiduously cultivate them. In doing so, we will be infinitely blessed as we journey with that friend on the path to sainthood. This was illustrated to me by a good friend at the beginning of our friendship when we could see that the friendship would be a great gift. At that time, he wrote in a card to me, “Let’s become saints together.” If that is not an apostolic exhortation, I do not know what is! It is indeed a fitting and true goal. I have been blessed with several very close Catholic friends and the greatest delight I take in those friendships is when I see my friend as God made him to be, when he shows me what it means to join oneself to Christ. We truly come to see Christ in that friend and we, in a sense, become in persona Christi to one another. We reveal Christ to one another, but only if we are faithful. Our greatest responsibility in these friendships is to be faithful to God above all else and therefore to be faithful to our friend. This fidelity helps us attain that goal of Christian friendship: to become saints together. Our Lord defines friendship in this way, “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you.” These are the friends we truly love; they are like other selves. They are the friends who become our best man or maid of honour, godparents to our children, tried, trusted and true friends in whose presence we long to be and who we long to serve. “Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honour.” These friends have come into our lives for our salvation and we for theirs. In this life, in hac lacrimarum vale, this must be the greatest friendship that can ever be. (The Reverend Andrew Bennett is a deacon of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and Eastern Canada.)",

Depuis hier, sur une ligne Aleria - Corte - Saint Florent, l'Est de la Haute-Corse est particulièrement arrosé : en moyenne, 40 à 60 mm de cumuls ces 12 dernières heures, et jusqu'à 120 mm dans le secteur de Scata dans l'Ampugnani.\nA ville du Petrabugno, au dessus de Bastia, un mur de soutènement, 12 mètres de long, 4 mètres de haut, s'est effondré sur la chaussée.\nCe matin encore on ne circulait que sur une voie.\nC'est la même chose sur la D105 à Canavaghja, mais surtout sur la RT 20, l'axe Bastia-Ajaccio, au niveau de la commune de Barchetta, à Funtanone... on ne circule que sur un voie. Il y aurait entre 50 cm et 1 mètres d'eau sur la route. La collectivité de Corse (CDC) annonce aussi la fermeture de plusieurs routes, la RD.137 et la RD.237 à Vescovato ; les routes du bord de mer à Folelli sont inondées et en plaine orientale la RD 34 à San Ghjuvanni di Moriani est fermée. Un déviation a été mise en place par San Nicolao.\nDe même la RD 262 entre Oletta et Santu Petru di Tenda est inondée et fermée. En fait, selon la CDC, toutes les routes secondaires entre Bastia à Borgo, côté littoral, sont inondées et impraticables, mais aussi les voies de contournement de Bastia comme les RD264 et 564.\nDifficile d'être totalement exhaustif puisque c'est l'ensemble de la côte Est qui est fortement arrosé depuis hier soir... du cap corse jusqu'au Fium'orbu. On signale, par exemple, des éboulement sur la RT.50 entre Vaccaghja et Aléria - la circulation s'y ferait sur une voie - ou encore des routes transformés en rivières, par endroit, dans le cap corse.\nBref une situation chaotique... et même à pieds : l'Aldilonda, à Bastia, est d'ailleurs fermée, tout comme le marché de Noël de Bastia. Il devrait rouvrir à 14h, à la fin prévue de cette alerte météo.",

    "text": "Thursday afternoon commuters trying to head west of the 5th Street Station on the Market Frankford Line were met with smoke in a fire that snarled train service and traffic above ground as handfuls of firefighters descended upon the area near Independence Hall.\nAround 2:10 p.m., the Philadelphia Fire Department responded to a small debris fire reported on the third rail of the tracks, said SEPTA spokesperson Andrew Busch. Initial reports suggested the cause might be debris that caught fire, which Busch said isn’t all that unusual.\nAdvertisement “I don’t know yet specifically for this one, but it’s almost always trash of some type,” he said.\nSometimes it’s as small as a piece of paper that catches fire. It’s why SEPTA does overnight cleaning .\nNo injuries to staff or riders were immediately reported.\nDue to the location of the fire on the rails, Busch said SEPTA had to turn off power, but because of the way the grid operates, the power is affected from Spring Garden to the 15th Street Station.\nFirefighters reported the fire was out around 3 p.m., though SEPTA needed to inspect the track and give the all-clear for service to resume.\nBusch said bus shuttles would be available to riders as an alternative until SEPTA had the all-clear and could resume service.",

    "title": "SANY Accelerates Transition to Clean Energy in The Industry 4.0 Era with Intelligent and Low-Carbon Development Strategy",
    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SANY Group (SANY), a leading construction machinery manufacturer, signed multiple strategic cooperation agreements in March to accelerate the transition into the new Industry 4.0 era led by clean energy technologies. Going forward, SANY will deepen cooperation with Mitsui Sumitomo Group (China) and its Innovation Laboratory, as well as Panasonic Four-dimensional in the field of battery asset management and risk control for new energy-heavy trucks, jointly promoting the development of the battery circular economy. Additionally, through collaboration with Ambarella, SANY will focus on the intelligent development of the automotive market, accelerating the advancement of higher-level intelligent solutions and leading the new trend of machine-unmanned (AI) operation. Driving the Development of New Energy-Heavy Trucks for a Green and Efficient Future The shift toward electric heavy-duty trucks is accelerating worldwide, including in China, as part of the broader movement toward low-emission transportation solutions. Nevertheless, as these vehicles become more prevalent in the market, potential adopters are expressing reservations. These concerns largely stem from a lack of thorough analysis regarding the total cost of ownership, uncertainty about the long-term asset value, and the absence of holistic risk management services within the sector. To address this issue, SANY Heavy Truck, Mitsui Sumitomo Marine (China), Sumitomo Mitsui Offshore Group Innovation Laboratory in China, Panasonic four-dimensional have formed a highly coordinated and compatible strategic alliance. They will leverage their respective professional advantages, explore innovative solutions, and deepen and broaden their future cooperation. As part of this collaboration, SANY Heavy Truck and Panasonic Four-dimensional will engage in in-depth discussions and cooperation to establish and maximize the value of a battery asset management system covering the entire lifecycle of electric heavy trucks. Building on this partnership, Mitsui Sumitomo Marine (China) will actively explore risk prevention measures and develop new insurance services tailored to the field of electric heavy trucks, providing robust protection for their widespread adoption and application. This trilateral cooperation is a strong alliance driving the healthy and stable development of a new energy-heavy truck industry, creating a green and efficient future, and contributing to the goal of a decarbonized society. Accelerating Industrial Intelligence Transformation: Pioneering the New Wave of AI Control SANY and Ambarella, an edge AI semiconductor company, (NASDAQ: AMBA), have formed a strategic partnership. The collaboration aims to focus on advanced mobility solutions for the global market. SANY agreed to leverage Ambarella's advanced CV3-AD family of automotive AI domain controller systems-on-chip (SoCs). The collaboration aims to develop cutting-edge automated driving solutions, conduct technical validation, and deploy them on SANY's upcoming commercial and special-purpose vehicles. Moreover, the two companies will collaborate on the joint development of high-performance and highly integrated automated driving solutions, with a shared objective of introducing the first collaborative vehicle model into production by 2025. Fermi Wang, Chairman, CEO, Director, and President of Ambarella, highlighted the alignment between Ambarella and SANY in digitalization and decarbonization. He emphasized Ambarella's AI SoC's industry-leading features such as low power consumption, high performance, and excellent image processing capabilities. Wang mentioned the success of Ambarella's CV2 series and the advanced capabilities of the 5nm CV3 series in supporting intelligent driving functions without high-definition maps. SANY is committed to being at the forefront of technological leadership and quality superiority, propelling innovation within the industry. By forging strategic alliances, SANY positions itself in harmony with worldwide shifts toward decarbonization and digital transformation, providing solutions that are both environmentally sustainable and operationally efficient. As a result, SANY is spearheading the new era of clean energy technology within its industry.",
