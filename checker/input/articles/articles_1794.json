Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre).

    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Lithium Corp. (“American Lithium” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:LI | OTCQX:AMLIF | Frankfurt:5LA1) is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) for the Tonopah Lithium Claims (“TLC”) project, located in the Esmerelda lithium district northwest of Tonopah, Nevada. The updated MRE has successfully converted Indicated Resources to the Measured category, increasing Measured Resources 47% from the previous 2023 MRE at TLC. The resource block model has been further refined, increasing the confidence of the TLC resource. The vast majority of resources used in the 2024 PEA Mine Plan are now within the more reliable Measured Resource footprint.\nThe updated MRE was completed by Stantec Consulting Services Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT and is based on an additional 44 drill holes drilled since the previously filed January 2023 MRE.\nHighlights : (see Table 1 February 2025 TLC MRE & Table 2 Previous January 2023 TLC MRE, below)\nLink to: Figure 1 – TLC Project Updated Mineral Resource Block Outline and Drill Hole Location Map (also see below)\nMeasured Resource – 6.17 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”) (1,365 Mt @ 849 ppm Li); increase of 47% contained LCE versus 2023 MRE Indicated Resource – 2.39 Mt LCE (553 Mt @ 808 ppm Li); decrease of 48% versus 2023 MRE Measured + Indicated Resource – 8.56 Mt LCE (1,918 Mt @ 839 ppm Li); 3% decrease from 2023 MRE Inferred Resource – 1.44 Mt LCE (345 Mt @ 780 ppm Li); 22% decrease from 2023 MRE American Lithium Interim CEO, Alex Tsakumis states : “We are very pleased with the newly established and upgraded Measured Resource footprint at TLC as it not only increases the resource confidence level in the Measured category but also represents the core of the 2024 PEA Mine Plan. Our focus remains on diligently and prudently advancing our projects as we prepare for an anticipated recovery in the battery metals market.”\nTable 1 – Updated TLC Mineral Resource Estimate (February 2025)\nCutoff Volume Tonnes Li Million Tonnes (Mt) Li (ppm) (Mm 3 ) (Mt) (ppm) Li Li 2 CO 3 LiOH.H 2 O Measured 500 803 1,365 849 1.16 6.17 7.02 600 645 1,097 923 1.01 5.37 6.11 800 396 673 1,065 0.72 3.83 4.36 1,000 217 369 1,208 0.45 2.39 2.72 1,200 100 170 1,345 0.23 1.22 1.39 Indicated 500 325 553 808 0.45 2.39 2.72 600 238 405 903 0.37 1.97 2.24 800 141 240 1,050 0.25 1.33 1.51 1,000 70 119 1,212 0.14 0.74 0.85 1,200 32 54 1,365 0.07 0.37 0.42 Measured plus Indicated 500 1,128 1,918 839 1.61 8.56 9.74 600 883 1,502 919 1.38 7.34 8.35 800 537 913 1,062 0.97 5.16 5.87 1,000 287 488 1,209 0.59 3.13 3.57 1,200 132 224 1,339 0.30 1.59 1.81 Inferred 500 203 345 780 0.27 1.44 1.63 600 139 236 887 0.21 1.12 1.27 800 83 141 1,022 0.14 0.74 0.85 1,000 39 66 1,169 0.08 0.43 0.48 1,200 13 22 1,326 0.03 0.16 0.18 CIM definitions are followed for classification of Mineral Resource.

The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Joan Kester, PG and Derek Loveday, P. Geo. of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.\nFigure 1 – TLC Project Updated Mineral Resource Block Outline and Drill Hole Location Map\nMineral Resource Estimation Calculation Methodology\nThe geologic model used for reporting of lithium resources was developed using Hexagon Mining’s geological modelling and mine planning software, MinePlan version 16.1.1. The geologic model from which lithium resources are reported is a 3D block model developed using the Nevada State Plane Central Zone NAD83 coordinate system and U.S. customary units. Block size is 50ft-X, 50ft-Y and 20ft-Z. Modeling method and approach is similar to that described in the prior Technical Report (Loveday and Kester, 2023) but with a re-interpretation of geologic controls on mineralization using the additional exploration drilling and geophysical data.\nA base case lithium resource cut-off grade has been calculated based on the economics of a medium size (100 Mtpa) run-of-mine (ROM) surface mining operation that does not require blasting. Processing of the mineralized material would be onsite extracting lithium from claystone using an acid digestion method. Resources are reported from within an economic pit shell at 45-degree constant slope using Hexagon mining Pseudoflow algorithm. Maximum pit depth is limited to 1,000 feet (304.8 m) below surface. No underground mining is considered.\nThe following mining, processing, royalty, and recovery costs, in US$, were used to derive a base case cut-off grade to produce a lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) equivalent product:\nMining costs US$3/tonne; Processing costs US$49/tonne; Royalties US$1/tonne; General and administration US$1/tonne; and Processing recovery 90%. Revenue from a lithium carbonate product is estimated to be US$20,000/tonne for the cutoff grade calculation. Using the above inputs and Li 2 CO 3 :Li ratio of 5.32, a base case cut-off grade for lithium is estimated to be 500 ppm, rounded from 501 ppm. The base case cut-off grade of 500 ppm lithium is the same as the prior (Loveday and Kester, 2023) Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) using the same cost assumptions as the prior MRE.\nThe updated base case MRE represents an increase of 47% Li 2 CO 3 equivalent tonnes in the Measured Category, a decrease of 48% for the Indicated category when compared to the prior MRE (both at 500 ppm Li cutoff). Inferred Li 2 CO 3 equivalent resources have decreased by 22% percent when compared to the prior MRE for the base case.\nResource Estimate Parameters:\nResource Update Effective Date – February 7, 2023: 44 new drill holes (2022 to 2023) added to current MRE (16 RC and 28 Diamond) 82 drill holes (2019 to 2022 in previous MRE)\nQuality Assurance, Quality Control and Data Verification\nDiamond drilling was conducted by First Drilling of Montrose, Colorado using large diameter, PQ-size, drilling entirely vertical holes in 2022. In 2023 eight (8) additional diamond cores were drilled by IG Drilling\nof Payson, Utah using drill rig CS-14 using either a PQ or HQ diameter drill bit. Drill core samples are nominally 5-foot (1.53 m) length and are cut longitudinally, and one half of the HQ-size core, or one quarter of PQ size core is placed in sealed bags and shipped to analytical laboratories.\nReverse Circulation (RC) drilling was conducted by Harris Exploration Drilling and Associates Inc., of Fallon, Nevada with 5.5-inch diameter face centred bit on vertical drill holes. Sampling was conducted using a riffle splitter or a cyclone splitter depending on the moisture content of the sampled material. Sampling was conducted over 5-foot (1.52m) intervals with individual samples placed in sealed bags and transported to the respective analytical labs. In 2023 three (3) RC holes were\ndrilled by Harris’s Canterra Rig using 5.5” diameter.\nSamples were shipped to American Assay Laboratories (AAL) in Sparks, Nevada for sample preparation, processing and ICP-MS multi-element analysis. Pulps and rejects are returned and retained by the Company. AAL is an ISO/IEC 17025 certified assay laboratory. The QA/QC program includes a comprehensive analytical quality assurance and control routine comprising the systematic use of Company inserted standards, blanks and field duplicate samples, and internal laboratory QA/QC standard operating procedures. Downhole lengths (depths) for vertical drill holes are considered accurate true depth intersections for the essentially flat-lying, to gently dipping TLC host stratigraphy.\nMineral Resource Estimate Preparation\nThe Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Joan Kester, PG of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101.

Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCautionary Note Regarding 32 Concessions\nThirty-two of the one-hundred-seventy-four concessions comprising the Falchani and Macusani Projects are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared title to thirty-two concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. On November 2, 2021, American Lithium was awarded a favorable ruling in regard to title to the concessions, but on November 26, 2021, appeals of the judicial ruling were lodged by INGEMMET and MINEM. A three-judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior Court unanimously upheld the ruling in a decision reported in November 2023. American Lithium was subsequently notified that INGEMMET and MINEM have filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to assume jurisdiction in the proceedings. Given the precedent of the original ruling it is hoped that the Supreme Court will not assume jurisdiction; however, there is no assurance of the outcome at this time.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3fae412c-f633-4c9b-80cb-9b9afad01492",

    "text": "An evaluation by GeoSphere Austria shows that Christmas days in Austria have become on average one to two degrees warmer over the last few decades, and the chance of a white Christmas in the lower regions has significantly decreased. Many wishes come true at Christmas, but the one for holidays \"like in the old days\" with snow is becoming increasingly rare: An evaluation by Geosphere Austria shows that Christmas days in Austria have become on average one to two degrees warmer over the past decades. The chance of a white Christmas in the lower regions has thus significantly decreased. Since 2011, there has been almost no day with snow cover in the state capitals.\nEvaluation Shows: Chances of a White Christmas are Melting Away \"From year to year there are large fluctuations, but over the last few decades there is a clear trend towards ever milder temperatures at Christmas,\" said climatologist Alexander Orlik. \"If you compare the average temperature on the 24th, 25th and 26th of December in the period 1961 to 1990 with the period 1991 to 2020, for example, there is a warming of around one to two degrees in the state capitals of Austria.\"\nIn Lower Regions, Rain is More Likely at Above Zero Degrees Celsius In the lowlands, temperatures above zero degrees are increasingly measured in December. Precipitation then tends to fall as rain, and any snow that has fallen melts away faster than before. White Christmases occur reasonably reliably in valleys from about 800 meters above sea level. Even here it has become milder, but it is still often cold enough for snowfall.\nFor example, in the past 30 years, there has been a snow cover at Christmas 25 times in Bad Mitterndorf (Styria, 814 meters above sea level), 26 times in Schoppernau (Vorarlberg, 835 m), and 16 times in Weißensee (Carinthia, 949 m).\nA snow cover on the 24th, 25th or 26th of December was to be expected every two to three years in most state capitals in the period 1961 to 1990, and every one to two years in Innsbruck. In the years 1991 to 2020, it occurred on the three Christmas holidays in Innsbruck on average every two to three years, in Graz, Klagenfurt and Salzburg every three to four years, and in Vienna, Eisenstadt, St. Pölten, Linz, Bregenz every four to six years.\nSince 2011 \"Very Low Snow Phase\" In recent history, the climatologist has observed \"even a very low snow phase\": \"Since 2011, there have been almost no white Christmases in the lower regions of Austria,\" says Orlik. A snow cover has since then only been observed in the state capitals in 2011 in Innsbruck, 2012 in Vienna and Eisenstadt, 2014 in Salzburg, 2020 in Innsbruck, and 2021 in Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt. By snow cover, we mean at least one centimeter of snow height on more than 50 percent of the observation site.\nLast Snow in St. Pölten 17 Years Ago at Christmas The state capital with the currently longest \"green series\" is St. Pölten. Here, the last time there was a snow cover of at least one centimeter on at least one Christmas day (24th or 25th or 26th December) was in 2007. In Linz and Bregenz, this was last the case in 2010, in Eisenstadt in 2012, in Salzburg in 2014, in Innsbruck in 2020, and in Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt in 2021.\nFor Christmas snow records, however, one has to look very far back. The Christmas record of all state capitals is held by the Innsbruck airport weather station with 96 centimeters of snow on December 24, 1962. The other records of the state capitals for Christmas were 55 centimeters at Graz airport on December 25, 1994, 50 centimeters in St. Pölten on December 24, 1969, 47 centimeters in Klagenfurt in 1994, 40 centimeters in Salzburg on December 24, 1962, 39 centimeters in Eisenstadt or 47 centimeters in Vienna Mariabrunn on December 24, 1969, 26 centimeters in Bregenz on December 26, 1969, and in Linz (airport) the record is 25 centimeters on December 25, 1969.\nExtreme Values at Christmas from Almost Minus 30 to Almost Plus 20 Degrees The lowest values also date back a long time. In the Austria-wide evaluation of all Geosphere weather stations below 1,400 meters above sea level, the cold record of minus 29 degrees was measured in Tamsweg (Salzburg) on the night of December 26, 1944. 1962 was also extreme. At that time, the highest(!) temperature on December 25 in Vils (Tyrol, Reutte district) was minus 19.8 degrees. In Kitzbühel, it was minus 27.9 degrees on the night of December 25, 1962. The Christmas heat record is held by the Salzburg airport weather station with 19.1 degrees on December 25, 2013.\nWhat the Christmas weather and snow conditions will look like this year is still uncertain, the experts emphasize. Especially in the lower regions, a lot is still possible in the next two weeks. But from an altitude of about 1,000 meters, many regions already have a snow cover - at least that could last until Christmas from the current point of view.\n(APA/Red)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nHosek wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.

    "title": "Nicaragua expulsa a siete sacerdotes hacia el Vaticano en medio de crecientes tensiones con la Iglesia | La Nación",
    "text": "San José. El régimen de Nicaragua anunció este jueves el envío de siete sacerdotes al Vaticano, en medio de crecientes tensiones con la Iglesia católica. La oposición afirmó que los religiosos fueron detenidos la semana pasada en una nueva ola de arrestos. Rosario Murillo, segunda al mando y esposa de Daniel Ortega, comunicó que “ayer miércoles 7 de agosto salieron de Nicaragua hacia Roma siete sacerdotes nicaragüenses, que han llegado bien y han sido recibidos por la Santa Sede”. Según el portal digital El Confidencial, los sacerdotes desterrados son Edgar Sacasa, Ulises Vega, Marlon Velázquez, Víctor Godoy, Harvin Torres, Jairo Pravia y Silvio Romero. El medio, crítico del gobierno de Ortega, reportó que estos religiosos formaban parte de un grupo de 13 que la Policía nicaragüense aprehendió o colocó en prisión domiciliar hace una semana en Matagalpa, al norte del país. Hasta el momento, no se dieron a conocer informes sobre el paradero del resto de los sacerdotes detenidos, ni por parte del gobierno ni de la oposición. LEA MÁS: ONG exiliada en Costa Rica denuncia detención de al menos 12 sacerdotes católicos en Nicaragua Ortega y Murillo sostienen que la Iglesia católica respaldó las protestas de 2018 contra su gobierno, manifestaciones que dejaron más de 300 muertos, según la ONU. El gobierno de Managua considera estos eventos como un intento de golpe de Estado patrocinado por Washington. Murillo calificó a los religiosos como “hijos del demonio” y “agentes del mal” que promueven “terrorismo espiritual”. El Colectivo Nicaragua Nunca Más, tras las recientes detenciones, denunció que “varias parroquias han sido asediadas y al menos 12 sacerdotes detenidos arbitrariamente, algunos de ellos con paradero desconocido y en situación de desaparición forzada”. El gobierno de Ortega no emitió comentarios sobre las detenciones ni calificó la salida de los siete sacerdotes de Nicaragua como una expulsión. El periodista nicaragüense Emiliano Chamorro, exiliado en Estados Unidos, expresó en la red social X que “la Iglesia católica está siendo crucificada por la pareja dictadora”, refiriéndose a Ortega y Murillo. Chamorro también criticó el silencio de los obispos y cardenales que permanecen en Nicaragua ante estas expulsiones. “Mientras la dictadura de Daniel Ortega desterraba a 7 de 13 sacerdotes secuestrados, los obispos de la Conferencia Episcopal estaban reunidos en Managua, pero como es costumbre, no hubo una carta pastoral o comunicado sobre la situación del país”, agregó Chamorro en su publicación. Un grupo de expertos de las Naciones Unidas denunció hace una semana que el gobierno de Nicaragua mantiene ataques “sistemáticos” contra la Iglesia católica y otras confesiones cristianas desde las protestas de 2018. Entre abril de 2018 y marzo de 2024, el grupo documentó “73 casos de detenciones arbitrarias de miembros de la Iglesia católica y otras confesiones cristianas”, aunque advirtió que “la cifra total podría ser más alta”. En enero, el gobierno de Ortega excarceló a dos obispos católicos, incluido Rolando Álvarez, y a otros religiosos, enviándolos a Roma. Brasil expulsa a embajadora de Nicaragua El gobierno de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva decidió expulsar a la embajadora de Nicaragua en Brasilia, Fulvia Patricia Castro. Esta medida responde a la decisión del gobierno de Daniel Ortega de expulsar al representante brasileño en Managua, según informó una fuente diplomática a esta agencia. Las relaciones entre ambos gobiernos se enfriaron en los últimos meses. Sin embargo, la ausencia del embajador brasileño Breno de Souza en un acto oficial reciente generó descontento en el gobierno nicaragüense. No obstante, “él no fue el único representante diplomático que faltó”, indicó la fuente. El acto en cuestión tuvo lugar el 19 de julio, en conmemoración del aniversario de la revolución sandinista, de acuerdo con medios opositores nicaragüenses en el exilio. Managua respondió solicitando la salida del diplomático. “Brasil respondió diciendo que ese no era un camino productivo, un camino que conduciría a resultados positivos”, de acuerdo con la misma fuente. A pesar de ello, Nicaragua insistió en la expulsión y Brasilia actuó de acuerdo con el principio de reciprocidad.",

    "text": "La France a accueilli jeudi deux enfants palestiniens blessés, qui ont été pris en charge dans des services hospitaliers pédiatriques. Des soldats israéliens se trouvaient dans le même bâtiment que trois otages abattus par erreur à Gaza et avaient entendu leurs appels au secours en hébreu cinq jours avant les faits, selon les conclusions d’une enquête de l’armée publiées jeudi. Une délégation du Hamas doit se rendre vendredi au Caire pour lui faire part de ses \"observations\" au sujet d’un plan égyptien prévoyant à terme un cessez-le-feu mettant fin à la guerre avec Israël à Gaza, a indiqué un responsable du mouvement. La population palestinienne à Gaza est menacée de famine, alerte l’ONU. Selon l’agence de l’ONU pour les réfugiés palestiniens (UNRWA), 40% de la population gazaouie craint de mourir de faim. Une situation qui pousse l’agence onusienne à demander une nouvelle fois un cessez-le-feu humanitaire L’armée israélienne concentre jeudi ses opérations sur le centre de la bande de Gaza malgré une situation critique pour les civils, des appels pour un cessez-le-feu et une possible \"expansion\" des opérations à la frontière avec le Liban. Outre la bande de Gaza, les forces israéliennes multiplient dans la nuit les raids dans des grandes villes de Cisjordanie occupée, notamment à Jénine et à Ramallah, où siège l’Autorité palestinienne de Mahmoud Abbas, selon l’agence officielle Wafa. L’état-major de l’armée a mis en garde contre une intensification des tirs le long de la frontière avec le Liban, pays d’où opère le Hezbollah, mouvement qui fait partie comme le Hamas palestinien de \"l’axe de la résistance\", un regroupement de groupes armés proche de l’Iran et hostiles à Israël. D’ailleurs, l’Iran a menacé mercredi Israël \"d’actions directes et d’autres menées par le front de la résistance\", [après la mort lundi dans une frappe en Syrie, qu’il impute à Israël, de Razi Moussavi, un de ses hauts grades.](https://www.rtbf.be/article/funerailles-en-iran-d-un-commandant-des-gardiens-de-la-revolution-tue-en-syrie-11306194) Et le chef d’état-major de l’armée israélienne Herzi Halevi a indiqué que les forces israéliennes \"sont dans un état de niveau de préparation très élevé pour une expansion des combats dans le Nord\", où les affrontements entre Israël et le Hezbollah sont quasi-quotidiens depuis le début des combats à Gaza.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 17, 2024) - Badlands Resources Inc. (TSXV: BLDS) (FSE: B7Q) (\"Badlands\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the successful results from its fall 2023 field exploration program, identifying multiple high-grade gold trends at the Bella Project, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. News Highlights Five Main High-Grade Gold Trends: The company identified five main high-grade gold trends with approximately 20 km of strike length at surface through mapping and sampling. Grab Samples Returned Assays up to 20 g/t Au. Out of the 420 grab samples collected, 60 samples returned over 5 g/t Au. Gold mineralization hosted in Banded-Iron Formation. Only 40% of the prospective mineralized unit has been prospected by the Company.Systematic Approach. The initial program has assisted in prioritizing the main targets for advanced exploration given that the mineralized unit has a surface expression of 50 km. Dale Ginn, President and CEO of Badlands, commented, \"The initial success of the 2023 Field Program gives confidence of the gold prospectivity in the Black Hills. Historically, the Company's focus was drilling deep extensions of the Standby Mine, but these samples reinforce the high-grade gold potential at surface. Badlands will continue to advance the near surface targets through exploration efforts of the team.\" Figure 1.

The project shares striking similarities to the Homestake Mine which is located 30 km to the north. At both locations, the gold is concentrated in the local iron formation, particularly where it is has been thickened by regional folding. The iron formation at the two locations has been noted to be stratigraphically distinct but nearly identical in composition. Badlands collected a total of 420 rock samples to investigate prospective areas identified from Lidar and historical data. Results have highlighted five trends which the Company plans to follow up on with systematic surface sampling and possible drill targeting. These trends have been named Lookout, Standard, Cochrane, King of West, and Montezuma. Lookout Trend The Lookout trend extends 2.5 km southeast from the historic Standby Mine. The majority of samples were collected from the altered, sheered, and folded Rochford iron formation which locally encompasses the Nahant Schist and Rapid Creek Greenstone. Grab sample highlights include 19.2 g/t Au, 18.95 g/t Au, and 17.7 g/t Au. Figure 2.
