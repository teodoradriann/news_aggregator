    "text": "自由開講～舊稿重登》南投縣府硬蓋焚化爐 茶鄉不再飄香 ◎ 帆船\n南投縣名間鄉松柏嶺不僅是全台最大的茶葉集散地，其出產的茶葉更供應超過半數的手搖飲店。然而，當地原以山明水秀著稱的美好環境，如今卻因縣政府計劃興建焚化爐而蒙上陰影。居民普遍擔心，若只依賴焚化爐來處理垃圾，恐怕會陷入「越燒越多」的惡性循環，最終不僅損害茶產業形象，更可能威脅到大家的健康。\n南投縣府有意在「茶鄉」名間鄉興建焚化爐，地方憂心恐嚴重衝擊茶產業。（資料照）\n事實上，早在2022年，中國醫藥大學邱姓研究生就進行了一項大規模研究，指出焚化爐周邊居民的健康風險不容小覷。該研究利用2008年至2018年間所收集的10萬5371位成年人的Biobank資料，分析了居住於焚化爐附近五年以上的居民健康狀況。研究團隊選取了五座周邊無火化場和工業區干擾的焚化爐，並依年處理量是否超過20萬噸分為高處理量組（G1）與低處理量組（G2），同時在空污較低的行政區內設置對照組（G3），排除工業區、火化場及焚化爐附近的民眾。經過年齡與性別配對後，共有3,774位受試者納入分析。研究結果顯示， 焚化爐與血壓上升有明顯關聯，尤其在高處理量焚化爐周邊，高血壓、心血管疾病及代謝症候群的風險均顯著增加，這一結果最貼近台灣的實際情況。\n請繼續往下閱讀...",

    "text": "转自：京报网_北京日报官方网站\n【#司机晕倒前刹车救下整车韩国游客#】#41岁司机离世前救下整车韩国游客#据“掌上张家界”消息，6月29日晚，11名韩国游客与带队导游金光日乘坐湘GY7668客车，从湘西自治州返回张家界。客运车辆行车记录仪显示，21点13分，当车辆行驶至张南高速西往东方向48公里+500米处时，意外突然发生。“车子突然往右打方向，往桥那边偏了一下，接着又往左摆。”金光日回忆起当时的情景仍心有余悸，“我起初以为是司机在避让野生小动物，就使劲喊‘师傅，怎么了’喊了好几声，他都没回应，车子还开始了蛇形走位。”车内监控清晰记录下更揪心的画面：司机肖波开始面部表情有点异样，右手潜意识地抬了几次，也不听使唤。导游立马起身警醒地大声呼喊肖波，就在完全昏迷失去意识的最后时刻，肖波以顽强的毅力完成了熄火拉手刹等关键动作。“他当时已经快晕过去了，可能是我喊的那一声让他清醒了一下，他拉着手刹杆，车子终于停了下来。”金光日说。最终，车辆稳稳停在高速路上，包括11名韩国游客、导游和肖波在内的13人，全都毫发无伤。随后，导游紧急联系120和高速交警，将肖波送往张家界市人民医院抢救。据悉，事发地点是数十米高的高速公路桥面，幸亏肖波紧急处理到位，否则后果不堪设想。在医院抢救期间，市交通运输局负责人专程到医院看望慰问家属。经过3天全力抢救，肖波因脑干出血，生命永远停留在41岁。“晚上10点接到医院电话时，我根本不敢信。赶到医院，他已经在手术台上了。”肖波的弟弟肖应红着眼眶说。在他眼里，哥哥作为退役军人，军人的优良作风早已刻进骨子里。“家里长辈都夸他，说他作风正、人老实，关键时刻从不含糊。”肖波生命中最后十几秒用生命守护乘客安全的英雄行为，生动展现了新时代退役军人“退伍不褪色、危难显担当”的崇高精神。他就职的公司和获救韩国游客，对其恪守军人本色、坚守职业操守的崇高品质给予诚恳的评价。",

    "text": "Highlights\n- US Spot Ethereum ETF recorded an outflow of $3.24 million on November 14, breaking its six-day inflow streak.\n- Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE) led the outflows with nearly $22 million with BlackRock ETHA offsetting it.\n- ETH price dropped 6% in the past 24 hours to $3,000, erasing over $22 billion in market capitalization.\n- Analyst highlight a re-entry opportunity at Supertrend support just around $3,000 levels.\nAfter six consecutive days of inflows, the spot Ethereum ETF flows flipped negative again on Thursday, as the bullish sentiment driven by Trump-trade subsided. The ETH price also dropped 6% in the last 24 hours moving all the way to $3,000 losing over $22 billion in market cap.\nSpot Ethereum ETF Flips Negative\nAfter six consecutive days of inflows, the US Spot Ethereum ETF is once again seeing outflows. On November 14, Ethereum ETFs experienced a minor outflow of $3.24 million, the first since the Donald Trump victory on November 5.\nDespite this, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw a net inflow of $18.87 million in a single day. However, Grayscale’s ETHE played the spoilsport with nearly $22 million in outflows yesterday. Besides, inflows in other Ether ETFs have dried up significantly, as per the data from SoSoValue.\nFollowing the Donald Trump victory on November 5, the spot Ether ETFs saw strong inflows as the ETH price rallied 40% on the weekly timeframe all the way to $3,400. However, since the November top, the ETH price has corrected nearly 10% as bulls try to defend $3,000 levels.\nETH Price Action in Choppy Market\nAmid the recent ETH price action, popular crypto trader Credibull Crypto has started to build a position in Ethereum (ETH) and add further if Ethereum drops to $2,800, amid the current low-time-frame (LTF) price action and crypto market drop. The decision to increase their exposure is based on Bitcoin’s recent stability, which may prevent a quick pullback to the low $80k range and allow ETH to continue upward.\nThe trader notes that a small range is forming, pushing into local demand, with untapped local highs above. They are eyeing potential gains toward the $3,500+ level before reassessing. However, the trader emphasizes that the invalidation point for their higher-time-frame (TF) ETH strategy is at $2,350.\nWatching this LTF PA develop on\n[$ETH]and have started positioning here. If we make it down to the ideal entry zone (sub $2800) I'll add to my position.Reason for going in more aggressively here is that BTC is holding up decently atm and if we don't get a pullback to low 80k's…\n[pic.twitter.com/TmwCxBLgbu]— CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto)\n[November 14, 2024]\nPopular trading account IncomeSharks suggests that traders who missed the initial entry opportunity might find a second chance near Supertrend support just under $3,000. The trader also added that the swift shift in market sentiment, as “a few red candles” have led to widespread pessimism and negativity toward the asset. However, he believes that there’s a strong potential for a rebound moving ahead. This can again lead to resuming the inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs.\nA recent Ethereum price analysis hints that analysts have been making bullish predictions for the crypto, potentially hitting $4,000, by November end. However, it will require the support of the broader market to continue this rally ahead.\nMOODENG Price Rockets 26% Amid Major Listing, Rally To Continue?Ethereum ETF Flows Flip Negative Again As ETH Price Slips 6%, What’s Next?Bitcoin Price Crash: Here’s Why BTC Price Is Falling TodayDogwifhat Smart Whale Dumps Heavily Booking Profit, Has WIF Price Topped?Michael Saylor, Cynthia Lummis Confirm Bitcoin Can Offset $16 Trillion US Debt\nPepe Coin Price Prediction After PEPE Doubles In a WeekHow High Could Cardano Price Go if ADA is Used in US ElectionsHere’s How Gensler’s Resignation May Impact XRP PriceHere’s What Needs to Happen for Dogecoin Price to hit $3: Analyst ExplainsTop 5 Ethereum Tokens to Buy to Turn $1K to $1M in November",
