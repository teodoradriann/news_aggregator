    "title": "Report: Attacks on Churches Increased 800% in 6 Years",
    "text": "Attacks on churches have increased nearly 800 percent in less than six years, indicating that “hostility against U.S. churches is not only on the rise but also accelerating,” a Family Research Council (FRC) report found .\nBetween 2018 and 2023, FRC identified 915 acts of hostility against churches in the United States by analyzing open-source documents, reports, and media outlets. In just the last year alone (between January and November of 2023), 436 acts of hostility against churches occurred, according to the report.\n“This was more than double the number of incidents in all 12 months of 2022, which was 195. It also marked the second consecutive year that saw more than twice the number of incidents of the year before,” the report states. “There were at least 96 incidents in 2021, 55 in 2020, 83 in 2019, and 50 in 2018. Over the entire reporting period for this report, from 2018 to 2023, acts of hostility appear to have increased in frequency over time”\nThe report notes that the increase “could be due in part to increased public reporting on crimes against churches, resulting in more available data than in the past.”\nIt’s all connected. The Left’s coordinated use of “Christian nationalism” and the rise in hostility against houses of worship. It’s an intimidation game designed to silence Christians and suppress our votes. Don’t buy it.\nKeep praying — keep standing — keep voting — for… pic.twitter.com/Apj9mMVUwP\n— Tony Perkins (@tperkins) February 22, 2024\nBy category, 315 attacks in 2023 were vandalisms, 75 were arson attacks or arson attempts, ten were gun-related, 20 were bomb threats, and 37 fell in the “other” category. Seventeen incidents fell into multiple categories, according to the report.\nBetween 2018 and 2023, there were at least 709 occurrences of vandalism, 135 arson attacks or attempts, 22 gun-related incidents, 32 bomb threats, and 61 other incidents (assault, threats, interruption of worship services, etc.). In 39 cases, multiple types of hostility occurred (e.g., vandalism and arson), the report states.\nThe incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, although states with larger populations tended to report more incidents.\n🚨 NEW REPORT!\nHostility against churches is on the rise in the United States.\n-2023 (Jan-Nov) saw a significant increase in acts of hostility against churches; we identified 436 incidents.\n-This was more than double the number of incidents in all 12 months of 2022, which was… pic.twitter.com/klWe6X45vj\n— Family Research Council (@FRCdc) February 20, 2024\nAccording to the FRC, the motives of most of incidents are unknown, although many attacks had political overtones and several were overtly Satanic. At least 59 of the churches in the report were repeat victims with verifiable timeframes of the incidents, according to the FRC.\n“Some acts of vandalism against churches appeared to have been motivated by anger toward the targeted church. Other acts appeared to have a political motivation. Some incidents appeared to have been committed by juveniles or persons struggling with mental illness,” the report states. “Several instances of vandalism also involved theft. Many acts of vandalism against churches were under criminal investigation; a minority were under investigation as hate crimes. Police were often unable to identify the vandals.”\nThe longest section of the report is a 97-page list of attacks on churches, which are corroborated by 50 pages of endnotes.\nStandout cases include several incidents of transgender violence against churches. The most shocking incident was the March 27 shooting at Nashville Covenant School. Trans-identifying Audrey Hale reportedly shot and killed six people, including three young students. Hale, who went by the male name “Aiden,” left behind a manifesto, most of which law enforcement refused to release, although a few pages were leaked .\nHOPE & HEALING: About 500 worshippers gathered to sing and pray at “A Day of Prayer” Christian revival tour — a partnership between Let Us Worship and TPUSA Faith — earlier this month in Nashville in the wake of the Covenant Christian school shooting. pic.twitter.com/M42hGP9Tau\n— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 10, 2023\nThe report lists another attack on January 3, 2023, by a man named Cameron Storer who identifies as a female. Storer is accused of setting fire to Portland Korean Church, a 117-year-old historic vacant building. Storer told investigators that he heard voices telling him to burn the church down.\nOn March 3, 2023, St. Joseph Catholic Church in Louisville, Kentucky, was vandalized with the painted message: “TRANS PWR.” The incident occurred after the state legislature overrode the Democrat governor’s veto of a bill that protects minors for sex mutilating surgeries.\nLouisville Catholic church hit with 'TRANS PWR' graffiti after House OK's gender bill https://t.co/Ma5XWC8dHV\n— Courier Journal (@courierjournal) March 3, 2023\nA number of incidents were linked to pro-abortion hostility after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And “at least 12 incidents included satanic imagery or symbols,” the report notes, listing several examples.\nThe FRC said it “set out to analyze publicly available data to better understand the problem and determine whether there has been a statistically significant increase over time” due to “the perceived increased in acts of hostility against churches in the United States.” The FRC released the February report following a similar report on incidents that occurred between January 2018 and September 2022.\nThe FRC said the report is not comprehensive and that “m any acts of hostility against churches are likely not reported to authorities and/or are not featured in the news or other online sources from which we collected data.”\n“Thus, the number of acts of hostility is undoubtedly much higher than the number reflected in this report. This report is intended to compile the publicly reported data and identify any trends,” the report states.\nAuthor of the report Arielle Del Turco noted that while the motivations of many attacks are unknown, “the rise in crimes against churches is taking place in a context in which American culture appears increasingly hostile to Christianity.” She wrote:\nCriminal acts of vandalism and destruction of church property may be symptomatic of a collapse in societal reverence and respect for houses of worship and religion—in this case, churches and Christianity Americans appear increasingly comfortable lashing out against church buildings, pointing to a larger societal problem of marginalizing core Christian beliefs, including those that touch on hot-button political issues related to human dignity and sexuality. Attacks on houses of worship may also signal a discomfort with religion in general.\n“The free exercise of religion has always been an essential component of American society and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution as a basic right,” she added. “Attempts to prevent religious exercise through threats or violence should be soundly condemned by anyone who values the First Amendment.”\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Every Christmas Day at 3pm, the King’s Christmas message is switched on and the family stand respectfully when the British National Anthem is played. “You can see among Dad’s stuff, there’s a plate behind us there, that’s uncle Fred’s and it’s of King George,” Mr Stewart said. “You would find that throughout this area, loads of stuff like that in people’s houses where the monarchy was very much at the heart of people’s culture and mindset.” Despite this, Mr Stewart admits attitudes towards the new King Charles are tepid and, like many Britons, he misses Queen Elizabeth. “There’s not the same warmth to Charles,” he said. “I think that’s because there was something special about the Queen. “Although, we would still recognise Charles as King; I would render unto Caesar what’s due to Caesar. “He is my King and I have respect for him.” Journalist and author Mary Kenny was five-years-old in 1949 but has vivid memories of the day Ireland became a Republic. “My brother James brought me to the Dodder River, which looked over towards Ringsend,” she said. “There was a huge fireworks display which was celebrating the declaration of the Republic and it seemed absolutely wonderful to me as a child. “I was a bit confused in some way because I thought, with some reason, that the Republic had been declared in 1916. “Then I came to understand that Éire was leaving the Commonwealth of British Nations and declaring a full Republic - something that did become quite controversial.” When Ireland became independent in 1922, the new Free State had reluctantly become a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. It meant the British monarch remained Ireland’s head of state - a fact that led many disgusted TDs to oppose the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In 1937, a new Constitution had been drawn up that contained no reference whatsoever to the Crown and Winston Churchill described Ireland as “neither in nor out” of the Commonwealth. Confusingly though, the External Relations (Executive Authority) Act of 1936 had empowered the British monarch to sign letters of credence for Irish diplomats. In all other aspects, power and authority rested completely with the Oireachtas. The final break was announced in 1948, when Taoiseach John A. Costello announced Ireland would leave the Commonwealth and officially declare the nation a republic. Decades on, Fine Gael considers the decision one of its greatest achievements in office. “It had been said by Michael Collins and others, Kevin O’Higgins, around the time of the Civil War and the early years of our State that the Free State was a stepping stone,” Fine Gael TD Charlie Flanagan told Newstalk. “Certainly, the completion [of that stepping stone] was the declaration of the Republic and interestingly enough, in order to ensure there was a Fine Gael stamp on it, when Costello took the bill through the Dáil towards enactment, he took it as Taoiseach - which was unusual. “It wasn’t left to the line Minister at the time, which would have been Seán McBride, who at the time was Minister for External Affairs.” However, the decision upset some Fine Gael supporters from the Protestant community, many of whom valued the connection Commonwealth membership provided with Britain and other English-speaking countries around the world. While researching her book, Crown and Shamrock: Love and Hate Between Ireland and the British Monarchy, Mary Kenny found a number of Irish people had written to King George, bidding him farewell. “Mrs Dorris Weir, who attended the Church of Ireland in Irishtown, wrote to the King to say it was like a farewell and she was really sorry they wouldn’t pray for the King anymore in the Church of Ireland,” Ms Kenny said. “They would now be obliged to pray for the President and they would no longer be allowed to sing God Save The King - which they had done. “She wrote to say she would still maintain feelings of love towards this institution and the King did send a nice letter. “It was kind of the end of an era for Irish Protestants of the time.” 'Part of a discussion' Not long after Ireland left the Commonwealth, India indicated it wished to become a republic while remaining a member of the organisation. The London Declaration of 1949 announced a compromise; member states could abolish the monarchy but remain part of the Commonwealth if they recognised the British monarch as “the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth.” Ireland decided not to re-apply for membership but Deputy Charles Flanagan feels it is conversation worth having in the event of a border poll. “I think there was a reluctance on the part of the Irish people to [rejoin] what was then the British Commonwealth,” he said. “We had fought hard for our independence, we had spilt blood for our independence. “So, I’m not sure if there were circumstances under which, in the 1950s, we would have re-joined the British Commonwealth. “However, 70 years later circumstances have changed; it’s no longer the British Commonwealth and it’s mainly a body that engages in trade, sport and culture. “I still don’t believe that the majority of the Irish people, if asked, would support the rejoining of the Commonwealth but I do think it’s something that obviously will have to be part of a discussion should there be, at some stage in the future, a united Ireland.” As Prince of Wales, King Charles has visited the Republic of Ireland a number of times on behalf of the British Government. On one such occasion, he told Deputy Flanagan he hoped to travel to all 32 counties on the island. Could his next visit include a stop in Drum? David Stewart and his father, William, chuckled at the suggestion. “Well, we wouldn’t kick him out,” William laughed. “But I can’t see that happening.” Main image: David and William Stewart with a plate with King George on it.

    "text": "Users have reported issues such as the address bar overlapping with content in full-screen mode, blocking access to Home and Gallery icons, and the \"See more\" or \"More options\" menus appearing at the top of the screen instead of below the cursor.\nSome menu options are becoming inaccessible when File Explorer is in full-screen mode.\nAdditionally, the mouse cursor disappears when interacting with text input, File Explorer's top bar is slow to load, typing a path in the address bar is reportedly not always working properly, and things crash when creating new folders in certain locations.\nMicrosoft has confirmed that fixes for these issues are being developed. Some patches have already been included in the Beta Channel build for Windows 11 23H2 and are expected to roll out to 24H2 users in upcoming updates.\nFor now, users are advised to use File Explorer in windowed mode instead of full-screen, resize the File Explorer window to access menu options, and try to use keyboard shortcuts. The first security update of 2025 for Windows 11 is scheduled for Jan. 14, which may include some of these fixes.\nWe have not been able to test any of this because our main computer will not install the upgrade, it just downloads it and has a snooze. We did a check and there are a few people on the worldwide wibble who have a similar problem.",

    "title": "Germania: Scholz, 'nazione sia unita di fronte a nuove sfide geopolitiche ed economiche'",
    "text": "Berlino, 31 dec. (Adnkronos/Dpa/Europa Press) – Il cancelliere tedesco Olaf Scholz ha espresso ottimismo sulla capacità del suo Paese di affrontare le numerose sfide geopolitiche ed economiche che il 2024 porterà, esortando al contempo il Paese a intraprendere un processo di trasformazione. \"Possiamo affrontare i venti contrari\", ha detto il socialdemocratico nel suo discorso annuale di Capodanno alla nazione, il cui testo è stato distribuito in anticipo. \"Ciò non diminuisce le sfide del nostro tempo\".\n\"La consapevolezza che siamo tutti necessari ci rende forti\", ha aggiunto Scholz. \"Sia il ricercatore di alto livello che l'infermiera geriatrica, sia la poliziotta che il fattorino, sia il pensionato che il giovane stagista. Se ci rendiamo conto di questo, se ci trattiamo con questo rispetto, allora non dovremo temere il futuro\". \"Non appena il Covid è stato lasciato a metà strada, la Russia ha iniziato una guerra implacabile nel centro dell'Europa\", ha detto ancora Scholz, ricordando che poco dopo, a metà del 2022, il presidente russo Vladimir Putin ha interrotto le forniture di gas alla Germania, innescando una crisi energetica nella più grande economia europea. Poi, quest’autunno, c’è stato il brutale attacco terroristico di Hamas contro Israele, ha osservato il cancelliere.\n\"Il nostro mondo è diventato più turbolento e duro\", ha aggiunto Scholz. \"Sta cambiando a una velocità sorprendente\". Ed è per questo che anche la Germania deve cambiare, ha spiegato. \"Per alcuni questo è anche motivo di insoddisfazione. \"Ma so che in Germania ne usciremo\". Scholz ha anche detto che vuole investire molto nel futuro. \"Perché chi oggi viaggia in treno o resta bloccato nel traffico davanti a un ponte in pessime condizioni, si rende conto che il nostro Paese è usurato da troppo tempo. Per questo investiamo ora: in strade adeguate e ferrovie migliori\".",
