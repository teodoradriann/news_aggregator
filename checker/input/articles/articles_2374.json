    "text": "STORY AT-A-GLANCE\nResearch shows vitamin B12 rapidly replenishes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in pancreatic cells, preventing destructive enzyme activation that causes acute pancreatitis inflammation\nPeople with naturally higher vitamin B12 levels show significantly lower risk of developing acute pancreatitis, independent of lifestyle factors\nVitamin B12 enhances energy metabolism by converting methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, stabilizing cell membranes and containing digestive enzymes properly\nEarly vitamin B12 administration provides greatest protection, with 1,000-2,000 micrograms daily recommended for supplementation or monthly injections for severe deficiency\nCombine vitamin B12-rich foods like grass fed liver alongside minimal vegetable oil intake and regular exercise to support overall pancreatic health\nAdvertisement The pancreas is a gland responsible for producing insulin, which is important for blood sugar control. It also produces digestive enzymes, which are stored and inactivated before being sent to the small intestine to do their work. But sometimes, these enzymes “turn on,” causing them to act like digestive juices within the pancreas, leading to an immune response that results in acute pancreatitis.\nLeft unaddressed, acute pancreatitis causes uncomfortable pain, as well as increasing your risk for infection, kidney failure, and diabetes. Standard treatment usually involves painkillers, but this doesn’t address the source. However, research shows that a common nutrient halts and even repairs your pancreas — vitamin B12.\nVitamin B12 Repairs Pancreatic Damage\nIn a study published in MedComm, researchers investigated how vitamin B12 protects the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. They combined genetic analyses in humans with detailed laboratory experiments in mice, creating a picture of how vitamin B12 directly prevents pancreatic cell death and dramatically reduces inflammation during acute episodes.\nGenetic analyses show benefits of vitamin B12 — By studying natural genetic variations linked to vitamin B12 levels, the researchers determined that people genetically predisposed to higher levels of vitamin B12 were significantly less likely to develop acute pancreatitis. This was apparent after accounting for factors like lifestyle or diet that usually complicate observational studies.\nAnimal models support human analyses — The researchers specifically targeted acinar cells, the pancreatic cells responsible for secreting digestive enzymes, which become severely damaged during acute pancreatitis.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nFor their experiment, the team used genetically modified mice lacking the transcobalamin receptor for vitamin B12, which helps regulate vitamin B12 uptake. Without the receptor, cells could no longer absorb and utilize B12 efficiently, replicating conditions similar to deficiency in humans.\nSupplemental vitamin B12 produced immediate results — Within a few hours of B12 administration, mice showed substantially reduced pancreatic injury. The levels of digestive enzymes such as amylase, which skyrocket during severe pancreatitis, dropped quickly back toward normal.\nB12 effectively halted the progression of cellular destruction — Under a microscope, pancreatic tissues treated with B12 showed remarkably preserved cellular structure. The destructive cellular breakdown known as necrosis is dramatically reduced:\n“Based on our findings, ATP supplementation did not significantly increase the level of inflammation but effectively prevent cell necrosis during the progresses of induced acute pancreatitis in both VB12 uptake deficiency mice and wild‐type mice. Thus, VB12 restores the pancreatic structures and protects the acinar cells in the early phase of pancreatitis in mouse models via the ATP production pathway.” 1\nTiming is a significant factor — Administering vitamin B12 at the onset of inflammation provided the greatest benefit, rapidly halting or even reversing early cellular damage. However, even delayed treatment still slowed the destructive processes.\nCertain groups will benefit the most from increased vitamin B12 — The researchers noted individuals who are genetically predisposed to absorbing less vitamin B12 or who have limited dietary intake are likely to see the most pronounced improvements. Because these populations typically start with lower baseline B12 levels, supplementation provides a critical boost exactly when cellular demands peak during acute pancreatitis episodes.\nHow vitamin B12 protects your pancreatic cells at the molecular level — Central to the protective benefits of vitamin B12 is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy powering every cell in your body. When pancreatitis strikes, ATP production plummets, leaving cells starved of the energy required to maintain structural integrity and normal function.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nVitamin B12 rapidly reversed this issue by replenishing ATP levels through enhancing mitochondrial energy pathways, specifically converting methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a critical step that revitalizes energy production.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThis restoration of ATP is essential because maintaining healthy ATP levels directly prevents pancreatic enzymes from prematurely activating inside the cells, which, as mentioned earlier, is a key event that triggers the destructive cascade of acute pancreatitis. Without adequate ATP, pancreatic cells weaken and collapse, digestive enzymes escape prematurely, and the pancreas essentially begins digesting itself.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nBy ensuring rapid ATP replenishment, vitamin B12 stabilizes cell membranes and maintains intracellular integrity, keeping destructive enzymes safely contained within their proper compartments.\nVitamin B12 works straight toward the pancreas — The researchers ruled out indirect metabolic pathways commonly associated with B12, such as the regulation of homocysteine levels. Instead, their experiments confirmed a direct mitochondrial mechanism:\n“[R]esults indicate that folate and homocysteine are not associated with acute pancreatitis in humans, excluding the possibility that VB12 displays a protective role in the progress of acute pancreatitis via homocysteine or folate pathway. Most likely, VB12 restores the pancreatic structures and protects the acinar cells in the early phase of pancreatitis in mouse models via succinyl‐CoA‐based energy metabolism involved in ATP production.”\nVitamin B12 Boosts Cellular Defenses by Targeting Oxidative Damage\nIn a related study, published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity, researchers explored how vitamin B12 reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis by fighting oxidative stress and improving the function of mitochondria. To add, the researchers dove into the biochemical mechanisms behind B12’s protective effects using chemically induced pancreatitis in animal models. Afterward, the team measured levels of inflammation, oxidative damage, and cell survival after giving varying doses of vitamin B12. 2\nDramatic improvement in overall pancreatic health occurred — Researchers saw clear reductions in oxidative stress markers that accumulate rapidly in pancreatitis:\n“As expected, VB 12 suppressed the increase in intracellular ROS caused by NaT treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Various transcription factors in the antioxidant system are regulated by Nrf2 to maintain the redox homeostasis of cells and protect cells from oxidative damage. Western blot analysis showed that VB 12 inhibited the decrease of Nrf2 expression in acinar cells exposed to NaT.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nSimilarly, p-P38, a marker of oxidative stress, increased in the NaT treatment group, while VB 12 inhibited its expression. These results indicate that the occurrence of oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis may be due to the lack of CBS and could be improved by VB 12.” 3\nVitamin B12 promotes better mitochondrial function — Normally, acute pancreatitis severely damages mitochondria, causing energy production to plummet. However, vitamin B12 administration quickly improved mitochondrial health, stabilizing energy output and ensuring that the pancreas had the fuel needed to repair itself. This improvement in mitochondrial function was seen within 24 hours after treatment:\n“[W]e presume that VB 12 could improve mitochondrial impairment related to CBS deficiency in acinar cells … Parkin, the main regulator of mitochondrial autophagy, was significantly reduced, and the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II and autophagy adaptor protein P62 was increased after NaT loading, while VB 12 treatment increased the expression of Parkin and decreases the levels of LC3II and P62.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThese results confirm our conjecture that VB 12 may repair mitochondrial function by promoting mitophagy.”\nTiming matters — Similar to the MedComm study, the researchers observed the most substantial benefits in animals that received early and higher doses of vitamin B12. Administering B12 at the onset of acute inflammation resulted in the most effective reduction of cellular damage. But even at later stages, supplementation continued to deliver notable improvements.\nVitamin B12 exerts its protective effects by activating the CBS/SIRT1 pathway — CBS (cystathionine-β-synthase) is an enzyme that regulates your body's antioxidant defenses by influencing glutathione levels:\n“CBS regulates homocysteine metabolism and contributes to GSH (glutathione) biosynthesis through which it plays multifunctional roles in the regulation of cellular energetics, redox status, DNA methylation, and protein modification. Clinically, patients with untreated CBS deficiency suffer from various diseases, including hyperhomocysteinemia, thrombosis, osteoporosis, and mental retardation.” 4\nVitamin B12 significantly increased CBS activity — By doing so, it boosted glutathione production, enhancing your cells' ability to neutralize oxidative stress effectively, which means your pancreas is better equipped to handle inflammation and repair damaged tissues.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nSimultaneously, vitamin B12 enhanced the activity of SIRT1, which improved the cells' ability to recover from oxidative damage by initiating repair mechanisms within mitochondria, helping damaged mitochondria recover their normal function.\nSIRT1 is vital for cell survival and longevity — In relation to the finding above, blocking SIRT1 activity erased most of the beneficial effects of B12, further proving that this specific biochemical pathway is essential.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nWhen the CBS/SIRT1 pathway was disrupted experimentally, the protective effects of vitamin B12 nearly vanished, underscoring how important these enzymes are in B12’s protective mechanism. Thus, it’s clear that optimizing CBS and SIRT1 functions through vitamin B12 supplementation supports your pancreas when inflammation and cellular stress strike.\nProtect Your Pancreas with These Practical Strategies\nIf you're dealing with acute pancreatitis or want to prevent it, your goal is to tackle the root causes — mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired cellular energy production. Based on the published research, vitamin B12 plays a role in supporting optimal pancreatic function. To take advantage of this, here are my recommendations:\nTest your levels first — If you’ve over 50 years old or feel unwell, ask your doctor for a vitamin B12 test. Regular blood checks every six to 12 months will also allow you for early intervention to maintain optimal vitamin B12 levels.\nIncrease your vitamin B12 intake — Start boosting your intake of vitamin B12-rich foods like grass fed beef liver, pastured eggs, and wild-caught sardines. Consider taking supplemental B12 as well to ensure you’re getting enough to stabilize your mitochondria and rapidly reduce inflammation.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nOral supplementation is generally effective for mild to moderate deficiency, with dosages ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 micrograms daily. Intramuscular injections, typically administered monthly, are more suitable for patients with severe deficiency or those with malabsorption issues.\nUse dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) — Aside from B12, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dramatically enhances your antioxidant defenses, helping neutralize oxidative stress quickly for pancreatitis. DMSO improves cellular oxygenation and helps deliver antioxidants right where your pancreas needs them most, rapidly restoring tissue health and energy balance.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nIn one study, researchers conducted a double-blind trial involving 78 patients with chronic recurring pancreatitis. From that population, 26 of them received a rectal administration of 10% DMSO; at least 57% of this subset were free from pain after 12 hours compared to 17% of the control group. By 24 hours, all were pain-free. All DMSO subjects were discharged after three days, while 22% of the control group were discharged after five days of hospitalization. 5\nMinimize your linoleic acid (LA) intake — If your diet includes foods high in LA, you’re adding fuel to the inflammatory fire in your pancreas. Thus, removing these damaging oils helps stop inflammation at its source, reducing oxidative stress and allowing your mitochondria to recover quickly.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nI recommend minimizing your LA intake below 5 grams, but if you can get it to below 2 grams, that’s even better. To help you achieve this goal, be sure to download my Mercola Health Coach app — the beta version will be released on the first week of June, while the full version is coming in July. It contains a useful feature called the Seed Oil Sleuth, which will track your LA intake to a tenth of a gram.\nStart exercising — Another useful adjunct to managing pancreatic health is getting regular exercise. In a study published in PLoS One, researchers noted that people with higher leisure screen time (LST) have an increased risk of pancreatitis because they usually have unhealthy eating habits that lead to gallstones, which commonly trigger acute pancreatitis. 6\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThat said, I recommend you start going for a walk, as it’s one of the best exercises you can do for your health. In my interview with Dr. James O’Keefe , he noted that your risk of mortality decreases by 10% to 15% for every 1,000 steps you take. More importantly, he noted that it also helps your all-cause survival rate two times better than vigorous exercise. For an in-depth discussion on this topic, read “ The Benefits of Walking — How to Get More Steps in This Summer .”\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Pancreatitis and Vitamin B12\nQ: What causes acute pancreatitis, and why is it harmful?\nA: Acute pancreatitis happens when digestive enzymes activate too early, causing the pancreas to digest itself. This leads to severe pain, inflammation, and increased risk for complications like infection, kidney failure, and diabetes.\nQ: How does vitamin B12 protect against pancreatitis?\nA: Vitamin B12 helps by rapidly restoring cellular energy, protecting pancreatic cells from injury, reducing inflammation, and preventing the premature activation of digestive enzymes. It also fights oxidative damage and promotes mitochondrial health, ensuring cells have energy to repair themselves.\nQ: Is vitamin B12 effective immediately after pancreatitis begins?\nA: Yes. Research shows that administering vitamin B12 at the onset of pancreatitis provides rapid and significant protection against cellular damage. Even delayed treatment can help slow and reduce the damage.\nQ: Who benefits most from vitamin B12 supplementation?\nA: Individuals genetically predisposed to lower vitamin B12 absorption or those with limited dietary intake benefit the most. These groups usually have lower baseline B12 levels, making supplementation helpful during acute episodes.\nQ: What practical steps can I take to support pancreatic health?\nRegularly test your vitamin B12 levels, especially if you’re over 50 years old.\nIncrease your intake of vitamin B12-rich foods or supplements.\nConsider naturally occurring compounds like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nMinimize intake of inflammatory vegetable oils and ultraprocessed foods.\nEngage in regular moderate exercise, such as walking, to improve overall pancreatic health.\nNEXT ARTICLE >>\nDisclaimer : The entire contents of this website are based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola, unless otherwise noted.
