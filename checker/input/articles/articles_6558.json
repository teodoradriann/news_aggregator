    "text": "Large parts of the country will be hit with heavy snow and freezing rain over the weekend, forecasters have warned, after temperatures fell as low as minus 5C overnight.\nStranded vehicles on the roads and delayed or cancelled rail and air travel will all be possible as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nInitial data indicated that Rostherne in Cheshire and Yeovilton in Somerset dropped to minus 5C overnight, just shy of previous estimates which suggested the mercury could dip as low as minus 8C.\nIn Scotland, Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway felt the same chilly temperatures, hitting minus 5C at 11pm on Thursday.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January last year was minus 14C, in Dalwhinnie in the Scottish Highlands.\nA yellow warning for snow and ice is in place from 12pm on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers most of England and Wales, while a separate warning for heavy snow from midnight on Sunday until 12pm on Monday has been issued for most of mainland Scotland.\nTravel delays are possible along with a “small chance” of power cuts and injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces, forecasters said.\nNational Rail Enquiries said the line between Inverness and Dingwall in northern Scotland would be closed until at least 11am on Saturday because of “multiple landslips and areas flooded”, meaning no ScotRail services between Inverness and Wick/Thurso and between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh.\nPrevious warnings for snow and ice covering much of Scotland, western areas of Wales, north-west England and Northern Ireland ended on Friday morning.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nCouncils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: “Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n“St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.”\nDan Stroud, meteorologist at the Met Office, said conditions should become warmer by the end of the weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nHe said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles (for temperature figures).\n“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad)\nConvocada huelga en los supermercados asturianos en plenas navidades\nLas negociaciones del convenio colectivo no avanzan, según los sindicatos, que retoman los paros cinco años después\nLugones\nOnce mil trabajadores de los supermercados asturianos están llamados a la huelga los días 23, 24, 30 y 31 de diciembre. Es lo que han decidido, este domingo, los asistentes en el Centro polivalente de Lugones en el concejo de Siero, a la asamblea convocada por los sindicatos para valora qué acciones tomar en la negociación del nuevo convenio colectivo.\nJusto cinco años después de la huelga que en diciembre de 2019 acabó con la firma de un acuerdo de convenio, el alejamiento de las posturas con la patronal ha llevado a que este domingo se haya decidido retomar las movilizaciones. Se quejan los sindicatos de que tras caducar en diciembre pasado el convenio, la patronal plantea ahora una mejora de mínimos totalmente insuficiente. UGT, CCOO, USO y FETICO aseguran que la propuesta de las empresas no aborda el principal problema: la diferenciación salarial por categorías profesionales, por lo que prácticamente toda la plantilla cobra el salario mínimo. Tampoco convence la subida salarial propuesta ni que se mantenga congelada la antigüedad.\nEl convenio del sector minorista afecta a trabajadores de supemercados y tiendas de alimentación. No están regulado por él ni lo hipermercados ni empresas con convenios propios caso de Día, Lidl o Mercadona entre otros.",

    "text": "Following and order a new trial, reactions have poured in, many expressing dismay at the turn of events.\nThe court on Thursday argued that the previous ruling had committed serious errors in recognizing invalid testimonies in the landmark trial that drove the.\nThe decision was based on “erroneous” occurrences during the initial process, including a decision to let women testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case.\n‘Unfair to survivors’\nCharlotte Proudman, a barrister and equal rights activist, posted on X that “every survivor who relived their trauma and gave evidence in court, will probably have to do it ALL over again. When victims say the ‘justice system’ re-traumatizes them, this is what they mean.”\nKey figures in the #MeToo movement have also spoken out, including Ashley Judd, the first actress to come forward with allegations against the movie producer.\n“That is unfair to survivors,” Judd The New York Times. “We still live in our truth. And we know what happened.”\nKatherine Kendall, another of Weinstein’s accusers to speak out following the decision, told the Times that Thursday’s development was “a terrible reminder that victims of sexual assault just don’t get justice. I’m completely let down by the justice system right now,” before adding, “I’m sort of flabbergasted.”\nDW spoke with Jayson Campadonia, news director at NBC News Radio & iHeart Media, who said the Weinstein court ruling is “sending shock waves” through Hollywood.\n“A polarizing figure like Weinstein — a lot of actors and actresses built their celebrity on the #MeToo movement. That’ll be interesting to see. Reese Witherspoon, who was one of the major proponents of the #MeToo movement, whether she will come out and say something. It’ll be interesting to see who comes out and says “what an egregious error or whatever” in the coming days.”\n‘Tremendous victory,’ says Weinstein lawyer\nWeinstein’s lawyer said Thursday that he always believed the law was incorrectly applied in the Hollywood producer’s trial, and hailed the overturning of the conviction as a great day for the US justice system.\n“From the bottom of our hearts, from our collective hundreds of years of experience, we knew that Harvey Weinstein did not get a fair trial,” Arthur Aidala, head of Weinstein’s legal team, told reporters. “We all worked very hard and this is a tremendous victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York.”\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the case, will now have to decide how to proceed.\n“We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,” Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email, according to the Reuters news agency.\nThe post\nAshley Judd among those to express dismay at Weinstein retrial appeared first on Deutsche Welle.",
