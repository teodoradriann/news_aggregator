    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, on May 25, 2023 , Embark Technology, Inc. (\"Embark\") and Applied Intuition, Inc. (\"Applied\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, among other matters, Azara Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Embark, with Embark continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Applied (the \"Merger\").\nOn June 26, 2023 , a putative class action complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\"Court\") by Marceil A. Hanshew , a stockholder of Embark (\"Plaintiff\"), against Embark and the then-members of Embark's Board of Directors (collectively, \"Defendants\"), captioned Marceil A. Hanshew v. Embark Technology, Inc. et al. , C.A. No. 2023-0654-NAC (the \"Action\"). The complaint alleged that the disclosures made in the preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on June 16, 2023 , in connection with the Merger, contained false and misleading statements. The complaint sought, among other forms of relief, a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Merger.\nOn June 26, 2023 , Embark filed a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC (\"Proxy\"), and on June 29, 2023 , Plaintiff and Plaintiff's spouse, David L. Hanshew (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed an amended complaint captioned David L. Hanshew in His Capacity as Attorney-in-Fact for Marceil A. Hanshew and Marceil A. Hanshew v. Embark Technology, Inc. et al. , C.A. No. 2023-0654-NAC.\nTo resolve the Action, Plaintiffs and Defendants ultimately agreed that Embark would make certain additional disclosures, which Embark made in Amendment No. 1 to the Proxy filed with the SEC on July 10, 2023 (the \" July 10 Amendment\").\nOn August 1, 2023 , Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the Action as moot, and later that day, the Court entered a stipulated order dismissing the Action with prejudice as to the Plaintiffs and without prejudice as to any actual or potential claims of any other member(s) of the putative class. The Court retained jurisdiction solely for the purpose of adjudicating Plaintiffs' counsel's anticipated application for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses in connection with the disclosures in the July 10 Amendment.\nIn order to avoid the time and expense of continued litigation, Applied, as successor in interest of Embark, subsequently agreed to pay $114,000 to Plaintiffs' counsel for attorneys' fees and expenses in full satisfaction of their claim for attorneys' fees and expenses in the Action. On December 21, 2023 , the Court entered an order closing the case, subject to Applied filing an affidavit with the Court confirming that this notice has been issued. In entering the order, the Court was not asked to review, and did not pass judgment on, the payment of the attorneys' fees and expenses or their reasonableness.\nSOURCE Applied Intuition, Inc.",

    "title": "Massive solar flare: Auroras expected in lower U.S. this weekend - Earth.com",
    "text": "A massive solar flare erupted from the sun on Thursday morning, sending waves of charged particles toward Earth. This powerful burst of solar energy has scientists and space weather experts keeping a close eye on potential effects here on our planet, including auroras expected in the lower part of the United States. Experts at the National Weather Service’s Space Weather Prediction Center ( SW P C ) reported that the flare, classified as an X9.0, occurred at 8:18 a.m. Eastern Time on October 3. This comes just days after another significant flare from the same region on the sun, known as Active Region 3842. Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation stemming from the release of magnetic energy associated with sunspots. An X-class flare is among the most potent, capable of causing significant disturbances to Earth’s magnetosphere, which can affect satellite operations, communications, and even power grids. The recent X9.0 flare is notable because it’s one of the strongest we’ve seen in this solar cycle. For context, only an X8.7 flare on May 14, 2024 surpassed it in intensity. “Solar activity reached high levels with six M-class flares and one X-class flare,” noted the Space Weather Prediction Center. “The X9.0 occurred at 8:08 a.m. from Region 3842.” In response to these solar events, the National Weather Service has issued a strong geomagnetic storm watch effective through Sunday. This alert comes due to two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) headed our way. CMEs are massive bursts of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. The geomagnetic storms resulting from these CMEs can have various effects on Earth. One of the most visually stunning is the aurora borealis, or northern lights. These natural light displays occur when solar particles collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, causing them to glow. “An aurora borealis forms when the sun’s ejections reach the Earth’s magnetic field , causing the solar ions to glow in a visual spectacle,” the National Weather Service explained. While the auroras are a beautiful side effect, geomagnetic storms can also pose risks. They have the potential to disrupt satellite operations, GPS navigation, and even power grids in extreme cases. The Space Weather Prediction Center mentioned that “with the arrival of two Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) over the next three days, the geomagnetic field has a chance of reaching strong (G3) geomagnetic storming levels, possibly even severe (G4) levels.” The first CME is expected to arrive on Friday, with the second following about 24 hours later. “Solar wind parameters are expected to continue at nominal levels prior to CME arrival,” the center stated. “A disturbance in the parameters is expected with shock arrival on October 4 from the first CME and elevated parameters continuing through October 6 with the second CME.” Regions 3842 and 3848 on the sun are large and complex but have remained relatively stable in their area and length. However, the magnetic complexity of these regions means there’s a continued chance for significant solar activity. The forecast suggests there’s a possibility for more X-class flares in the coming days. The Space Weather Prediction Center emphasized the importance of monitoring these developments. Given the strength of the two flares, the position of the region, and the magnetic complexity of the producing region, a Kp=7 ( G3, strong conditions ) is possible during one, maybe two synoptic periods during the three days.” Solar flares and CMEs can mess with Earth’s magnetic field . This can lead to things like: For most people, these solar events won’t cause any significant disruptions to daily life. However, those involved in industries like aviation, telecommunications, and satellite operations should stay alert. It’s also a good time for skywatchers to look out for potential aurora displays, even in regions not typically known for them. The Space Weather Prediction Center will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary. They noted that “the current geomagnetic forecast follows the CME-driven WSA-Enlil run initialized at 1 p.m. on October 3.” Adjustments to forecasts will be made if the timing of the CMEs changes. While technology has made us more resilient to these cosmic events, staying informed helps mitigate any potential risks. Keep an eye on Earth.com and the SWPC website for updates, and if you’re in a position to see the northern lights, it might be worth stepping outside after dark. The universe might just put on another show. —– Like what you read? Subscribe to our newsletter for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.

    "title": "Mayor sindicato argentino convoca huelga general contra medidas de Milei - Últimas Noticias",
    "text": "La Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT), la principal central sindical de Argentina, convocó este jueves a una huelga general para el próximo 24 de enero en protesta por las amplias reformas impulsadas por el Gobierno de Javier Milei. Según informó la central obrera en un comunicado, también se convocó una movilización frente a la sede del Congreso de la Nación, entre otras medidas de protesta para esa jornada. “Esto tiene que ver y es en respuesta primero a un decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) de características ilegales e inconstitucionales. No hay necesidad ni urgencia para aparecer con tantos artículos que dan vuelta a la matriz administrativa de nuestro país”, dijo el dirigente cegetista, Héctor Daer, en una conferencia de prensa. “(Las medidas del Gobierno) apuntan contra los derechos individuales y colectivos de los trabajadores”, alertó Daer. Por su parte, el líder sindical del gremio de los camioneros, Pablo Moyano, consideró que las medidas aprobadas por Milei suponen una “vuelta al menemismo”, en referencia al ideario político del expresidente Carlos Menem (1989-1999), peronista pero de ideas neoliberales. Además, el Comité Central Confederal de la CGT aprobó efectuar una presentación judicial contra el DNU firmado el pasado 20 de diciembre por Milei, que entrará en vigor este viernes. El decreto desregula en la práctica la economía argentina y, entre otras cosas, incorpora medidas de flexibilización del mercado laboral y afecta los servicios de atención médica prestados por los sindicatos. El Comité de la CGT también rechaza el proyecto de ley remitido este miércoles por el Gobierno al Parlamento, que, de aprobarse, otorgará amplias facultades extraordinarias a Milei, quien asumió la Presidencia argentina el 10 de diciembre pasado. La CGT acordó reunirse con el resto de las centrales obreras de Argentina para articular medidas en conjunto. En las últimas dos semanas, varias organizaciones sociales y sindicales se han movilizado contra las medidas anunciadas por Milei. La misma CGT se concentró el miércoles frente a la sede de la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Nación en una movilización a la que acudieron unas 8.000 personas, según los organizadores, y que se desarrolló sin incidentes significativos. Además, la central sindical ya ha iniciado un camino judicial contra el DNU con la presentación de un primer recurso de amparo que fue desestimado por los jueces, que alegaron defectos de forma.",

Corp. and arrived at the North Harbor Manila on April 12.\nA physical examination conducted by agents of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service assigned at the Manila International Container Port (CIIS-MICP) led to the discovery of 74 boxes containing dried marijuana or kush.\nBOC Commissioner Bien Rubio, who commended the CIIS-MICP men for the successful operation, stood firm in the agency’s mandate and President Marcos’ directive to stop the entry of smuggled goods and illegal drugs into the country.\n“We are seeing this modus more and more these days of marijuana being shipped through balikbayan boxes, which have become symbols of the Filipino diaspora. It’s sad to think that this modus is using something ubiquitous to every Filipino family as a balikbayan box because it degrades what that box symbolizes for us,” he said.\nCIIS Director Verne Enciso said the physical examinations were made on April 19, 23, and 24 after the CIIS-MICP office received “derogatory information” that the shipment contained illegal drugs.\n“Based on the report from our field station at the MICP, the shipment was declared to contain only household items, shoes, and motor parts from Thailand. We so far opened three boxes out of the 74 boxes found and now we have positive confirmation of the presence of marijuana,” said Enciso.",

The network’s Sei (SEI) tokens have also seen significant gains, marking over 75% increase. The network’s focus on speed and low fees, coupled with its EVM-compliant features, has attracted a growing user base and developers. The recent surge in Sei (SEI) and SEIYAN tokens reflects a broader interest in the Sei Network. The network’s on-chain metrics are heating up, with increased futures open interest and token trading activity. This suggests a bullish sentiment among traders and investors. While the Sei Network’s recent performance is impressive, its future success depends on continued development and user adoption. The network’s ability to maintain high transaction speeds and low fees will be crucial. However, it faces competition from other blockchains and must navigate the volatile crypto market. Cardano (ADA): Signs of an Impending Surge Cardano (ADA) is showing bullish signs on its 1-day time frame, with analysts predicting a retest of the $1 mark. Despite regulatory challenges, including being labeled a security by the US SEC, the outlook for 2024 remains positive. The ecosystem has seen significant growth, with its top DEX, Minswap, experiencing a 26,000% increase. Cardano (ADA) price has been fluctuating within a critical resistance zone between $0.50 and $0.6. Analysts propose two scenarios: an upward surge to the $0.70 range or a potential dip to $0.40. The asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in the neutral zone, indicating a stable trend. Cardano (ADA) future hinges on its ability to continue developing its ecosystem and navigate regulatory challenges. If it can maintain its current momentum and break through resistance levels, it could see significant gains. However, market volatility and regulatory scrutiny pose risks. Polygon (MATIC): Institutional Adoption and Its Impacts Polygon has teased a major banking partnership, sparking excitement and optimism for Polygon (MATIC) resurgence. Despite underperforming in the past year, Polygon (MATIC) ecosystem development and partnerships have continued to grow, including the launch of Polygon zkEVM and various collaborations. Analysts have tipped Polygon (MATIC) for a solid showing in 2024, with potential targets as high as $1.8. The asset’s break from a symmetrical triangle chart pattern sets an immediate target of $1.25. However, it currently trades around the $0.86 price level. The teased banking partnership could significantly impact Polygon (MATIC) price. If the partnership materializes and brings about greater institutional adoption, Polygon (MATIC) could see an explosive rally. However, the asset’s performance will also depend on the broader market sentiment and its ability to maintain technological advancements. Sui (SUI): User-Friendly Lending Protocol Drives Adoption Sui Network’s ability to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining low fees has made it home to one of the fastest-growing DeFi apps. Its unique architecture and horizontal scaling have attracted developers and users alike. The growing interest in Sui (SUI) DeFi applications suggests a positive sentiment among users and investors. The network’s focus on user-friendliness and efficiency likely contributes to this optimistic outlook. Sui (SUI) future success will depend on its continued ability to offer high scalability and low fees. As the DeFi space grows, Sui (SUI) could benefit from increased adoption. However, it faces stiff competition from other blockchains and must continue to innovate to maintain its edge. Aptos (APT): Strong Recovery Post-Market Crash Aptos (APT) has made a robust recovery following a recent market crash, regaining its pre-crash value completely. The blockchain has seen a surge in activity, with a 16% increase in user transactions and a 19% rise in monthly active accounts. This suggests a growing demand for the Aptos (APT) token and increased engagement within the Aptos community. Aptos (APT) experienced a strong rebound with significant buying interest around the $8.8 low, sending its price towards $11. This upward move led to significant losses for sellers, indicating a bullish sentiment. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged near the overbought region, suggesting a potential correction around the $11 level. The future of Aptos (APT) looks promising with the recent surge in user transactions and active accounts. If bulls hold the price within the resistance zone of $11-$14, Aptos (APT) price is anticipated to surge toward $20. However, this might come with strong bearish dominance, and traders might see a correction around the $11 level. The increase in the total value locked (TVL) of Aptos showcases exponential growth, further boosting the ongoing recovery of the Aptos (APT) token. Conclusion The crypto market undergoes significant changes driven by major token unlocks from projects like Aptos (APT), Injective (INJ), and Optimism (OP). Market dynamics are further influenced by the SEC’s decisions on Bitcoin ETFs. Amidst these fluctuations, Sei (SEI), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Sui (SUI), Aptos (APT), and Scapesmania emerge as promising, affordable investments with potential for significant growth, making them attractive choices for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Notably, [ScapesMania](https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=themerkle&utm_medium=mmedia&utm_campaign=2024HiddenStars3) stands out with its innovative core concept, robust tokenomics, stage bonuses, and benefits for holders. These features have the potential to further increase the project’s value. Now could be the best moment to become part of the community of ScapesMania holders.

    "text": "International cartel smashed as 40 arrested, 8 tonnes of cocaine and €65m in assets seized\nThe criminal network, with leaders intercepted in Dubai and Turkey, organised multi-tonne cocaine shipments from South America to the EU\nEuropol have announced the take-down of an international cocaine cartel on Thursday.\nA long-run investigation led by the Spanish Civil Guard (Guardia Civil), supported by Europol, resulted in the major hit on a criminal network involved in large-scale drug trafficking from South America to the EU.\nThis final operation is the culmination of a series of actions against this network that took place over the course of three years, according to authorities.\nOn Wednesday, four arrests were made in Spain after seven properties were searched. Jewellery and luxury watches were seized as well as a firearm and ammunition, €109,000 in cash and electronic equipment.\n40 arrests- including three high value targets- were busted in Brazil, Croatia, Germany, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.\nRoughly eight tonnes of cocaine was seized in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain.\nArmed cops seized assets amounting to €12.5 million and €3 million in Brazil, and over €50 million frozen in Serbia.\nThe internationally coordinated action is tied to a number of national and international investigations led by Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Turkey.\nThe sting was coordinated by Europol’s Operational Taskforce.\nThe criminal network was orchestrating multi-tonne cocaine trafficking from Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador to the EU.\nThe suspects arranged the trafficking into the EU through maritime shipments going via logistical hubs in West Africa and the Canary Islands.\nOnce the drugs had reached the EU, the suspects used handling centres in Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Italy and Spain to further distribute cocaine across Europe.\nThe leaders of the drug trafficking organisation were temporarily based in Turkey and Dubai. From there, they operated the control and command centres of the criminal network.\nIn August 2023, officers from the Spanish Civil Guard intercepted a vessel with 700 kilograms of cocaine on board near the Canary Islands.\nIntelligence analysis of historical data from the encrypted communication investigations revealed that the Croatian-Italian crew previously imported at least 500 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to Spain via this vessel.\nThe same operational method helped investigators to identify the coordinators and brokers, originating from the Western Balkan region.\nThey were established as high value targets by the Operational Taskforce for their involvement in financing and coordinating both shipments.\nThey are also linked to a previous interception of a tonne of cocaine, seized in September 2020 in the Canary Islands.\nIn addition to the investigations carried out in Spain, the information exchange between countries, led by Europol, showed that investigations led by Belgium, Germany and Serbia targeted the same individuals and their associates.\nBrazilian authorities targeted the Brazilian criminal organisation that had been transporting cocaine inland from source countries to seaports in Brazil and other logistical hubs.\nThey would then deliver cocaine shipments to West Africa, for further shipment operations coordinated by European criminal networks.\nThe Brazilian network provided different criminal networks with a number of criminal services, including logistics, and facilitated money laundering activities.\nIn March 2024, the Brazilian authorities carried out the last phase of an investigation into the laundering of the drug trafficking profits, which revealed that almost 500 bank accounts had handled over €371 million in the years prior.",
