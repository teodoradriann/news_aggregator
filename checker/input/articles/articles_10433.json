    "text": "Uma rotina de skincare matinal é essencial para manter a saúde e a aparência da pele. Ao acordar, a pele precisa de cuidados específicos para enfrentar as agressões do dia, como poluição e exposição solar. Além disso, a aplicação correta de produtos pode ajudar a prevenir o envelhecimento precoce e manter a pele hidratada e protegida.\nAdotar uma rotina de cuidados pela manhã pode parecer desafiador, mas é um investimento valioso para a saúde da pele. Com passos simples e produtos adequados, é possível criar um hábito que trará benefícios a longo prazo. A seguir, serão apresentados os passos essenciais para uma rotina de skincare matinal eficaz.\nQuais são os passos essenciais para a rotina de skincare matinal? Para garantir que a pele esteja bem cuidada e preparada para o dia, é importante seguir uma sequência de passos que envolvem limpeza, hidratação e proteção. Cada etapa tem sua importância e contribui para a saúde geral da pele.\nO primeiro passo é a limpeza, que remove impurezas acumuladas durante a noite. Em seguida, a aplicação de um tônico ajuda a equilibrar o pH da pele. A hidratação é crucial para manter a pele macia e evitar a desidratação. Por fim, a proteção solar é indispensável para prevenir danos causados pelos raios UV.\nPasso a Passo da Rotina de Skincare Matinal Limpeza: Utilize um limpador facial suave para remover oleosidade e impurezas. Escolha um produto adequado ao seu tipo de pele, seja ela oleosa, seca ou mista. Tônico: Aplique um tônico facial para equilibrar o pH da pele e prepará-la para os próximos passos. O tônico também ajuda a remover resíduos que o limpador pode ter deixado. Sérum: Opte por um sérum com ingredientes ativos que atendam às necessidades específicas da sua pele, como vitamina C para luminosidade ou ácido hialurônico para hidratação. Hidratante: Aplique um hidratante adequado ao seu tipo de pele. A hidratação é fundamental para manter a elasticidade e a saúde da pele. Protetor Solar: Finalize a rotina com um protetor solar de amplo espectro, com fator de proteção adequado. Este passo é crucial para proteger a pele dos danos solares e prevenir o envelhecimento precoce. Por que o protetor solar é indispensável na rotina matinal? O uso diário de protetor solar é um dos passos mais importantes na rotina de skincare matinal. A exposição aos raios UV pode causar danos significativos à pele, incluindo queimaduras, manchas e aumento do risco de câncer de pele. Além disso, os raios UV são responsáveis por acelerar o processo de envelhecimento, resultando em rugas e perda de firmeza.\nPortanto, aplicar protetor solar diariamente, mesmo em dias nublados ou quando se permanece em ambientes fechados, é essencial para manter a pele saudável e protegida. Escolher um produto com fator de proteção solar (FPS) adequado e reaplicá-lo ao longo do dia, se necessário, são práticas recomendadas para uma proteção eficaz.\nEstabelecer uma rotina de skincare matinal não precisa ser complicado. Com passos simples e produtos adequados, é possível cuidar da pele de forma eficaz e prática. A chave está na consistência e na escolha de produtos que atendam às necessidades específicas de cada tipo de pele.\nAlém disso, é importante lembrar que a rotina de skincare deve ser adaptada conforme as mudanças nas condições da pele e nas estações do ano. Consultar um dermatologista pode ser útil para personalizar a rotina e garantir que a pele receba os cuidados necessários para se manter saudável e radiante.",

    "title": "Jury rejects insanity plea for hate crime homicide in Green Bay prison",
    "text": "GREEN BAY – A prisoner who killed a Black prisoner at Green Bay Correctional Institution in 2022 did not have a mental illness impacting his decisions, a jury decided Thursday. It was the second verdict during a four-day trial. Joshua Scolman, 40, was convicted Tuesday of killing 25-year-old Timothy Nabors, Jr., and attempting to kill Lamonte Washington, 26, both as hate crimes, at Green Bay Correctional Institution in October 2022. Because Scolman entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect — commonly referred to as an insanity plea — a second phase of the trial began Wednesday, to determine his criminal responsibility. Scolman’s attorneys argued he was not capable of either realizing the wrongfulness of his actions or conforming his conduct to the law. The jury did not agree. They reached their verdict Thursday afternoon after around two hours of deliberating. Scolman faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday. \"Mr. Scolman is a racist. And Mr. Scolman is delusional.\" At closing arguments Thursday morning, Scolman’s attorney Brianna Zawada encouraged the jury to look deeper beyond the “easy answer\" that Scolman killed Nabors and tried to kill Washington solely because of racism. Zawada argued Scolman was experiencing psychotic delusions that made him believe he was being ordered by a higher power to kill certain people. “Folks, Mr. Scolman is racist. And Mr. Scolman is delusional,” she said. Brown County Deputy District Attorney Caleb Saunders argued in the prosecution’s closing argument that the only evidence supporting the idea that Scolman was delusional or psychotic came from Scolman reporting his symptoms and was therefore unreliable. Saunders said Scolman was motivated by hatred and racism, and even if he was delusional, his actions and demeanor immediately before and the attack showed Scolman was capable of controlling his behavior. He added that if Scolman were to be found not guilty due to mental disease or defect, it would be \"a way for Mr. Scolman and others like him to be relieved of responsibility for their hate.\" On Wednesday, the defense and prosecution each called a psychologist to provide expert testimony about their separate evaluations of Scolman and conclusions they drew from it. In their closing arguments, both the defense and prosecution claimed their psychologist was more credible than the other. A hate crime at Green Bay Correctional Institution Around 6:30 a.m. Oct. 21, 2022, while prisoners were let out of their cells for medication distribution, Scolman attacked two Black inmates on the stairwell from the first to second floors of Green Bay Correctional Institution’s South Cell Tower. Scolman lunged at Nabors, stabbing him in the chest. He then chased Washington down the stairs and around the first floor, before correctional officers were able to subdue them with pepper spray. Shortly after, prison staff realized Nabors had collapsed and was bleeding on the second tier. Nabors was transported to HSHS St. Vincent Hospital, where he was pronounced brain dead six days later. Washington received only minor injuries, and was treated at the prison. Earlier in the trial, multiple prison staff testified to providing emergency medical care to Nabors, who was awake for a few minutes before losing consciousness and his pulse. They also testified to speaking with Scolman after the attack. Two guards said he swore and used the N-word. The weapon Scolman dropped after being stopped by correctional officers was a handmade knife, which appeared to be constructed from a part of a metal bed frame. Its blade was 6 to 8 inches long, one correctional officer testified, and had a handle made of rubber and shoelaces. The knife also included multiple carvings, including a swastika. Evidence presented earlier in the week included a letter Scolman wrote to another inmate in December 2023 in which he described attacking Nabors and Washington simply because they were Black. The letter was filled with racial slurs against Black people and antisemitic language. An investigation report from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office also stated that before the attack, the prison had been investigating Scolman for “extremely concerning racist activity” — including \"numerous letters\" Scolman wrote regarding attempts to become a member of a white supremacist prison gang, for which a condition to be accepted was \"to kill a black male.\" Psychologists give opinions on Scolman's mental state Opening statements and all testimony for the second phase of the trial took place Wednesday. Because the defense had the burden to prove Scolman was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect — also known an NGI plea — the defense gave their opening statement before the prosecution. It’s the opposite of the criminal portion of the trial, where the defendant is innocent until proven guilty, and thus the prosecution has the burden to prove their guilt. \"This isn't about race entirely,\" Scolman's other defense attorney, Britteny Koenig, said in her opening statement. She said Scolman's \"delusions took over and guided his actions on Oct. 21, 2022.\" Saunders asked jurors to listen closely to the testimony from psychologists and people who interacted with Scolman the day he attacked Nabors and Washington. \"Many people in this community deal with mental illness on a daily basis. They're still responsible for what they do,\" he said. The defense called just one witness to testify: Kevin Miller, a Green Bay-based psychologist who has done hundreds of NGI evaluations in the past, both ordered by the court and retained by defense attorneys. Miller met with Scolman a year after the incident to evaluate if he believed Scolman had a case to plead NGI. For his evaluation, Miller also reviewed Department of Corrections records dating back to 2007, when Scolman was first sent to prison to serve a 51-year sentence for a drunken driving crash in Milwaukee that killed three people and seriously injured a fourth person. Miller said in his opinion, Scolman has multiple mental health diagnoses, and that those diagnoses impacted his decision-making abilities on Oct. 27, 2022. Two of those diagnoses Miller concluded were an \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder\" and an \"unspecified personality disorder with schizotypal and antisocial features\" — which had symptoms, Miller said, including having an \"odd or unusual appearance\" and \"eccentric or weird\" beliefs. Miller said Scolman opened up about his delusions after becoming more comfortable speaking with Miller. The psychologist said Scolman told him he believes he is descended from Scandinavian gods who order him to kill people who are not descended from those gods. He said his “targets” are identified when he is unable to see a person’s facial features. Miller testified that Scolman informed him that he saw many people as “faceless” — including Black people and those of non-white races, but also correctional officers and even his own attorneys. Miller testified that he contacted Scolman's attorneys' law office, as well as the district attorney’s office and the Brown County Sheriff’s Office about concerns that Scolman may try to kill his attorneys or another person in court, if given the opportunity. “I thought, either this guy’s faking it or this guy’s seriously mentally ill,” Miller said. Miller told the jury he did not draw a conclusion right away after the meeting, and instead reviewed more documents from Scolman’s history and also sought a second opinion, before concluding that he did not believe Scolman was faking mental disorders. When it was the prosecution’s turn to call witnesses, they also brought a psychologist. Their psychologist, Matthew Seipel, testified that he did not believe Scolman was in a state of psychosis on the day of the homicide, and should therefore be held criminally responsible. Like Miller, Seipel also diagnosed Scolman with multiple disorders, including anxiety, depression and antisocial personality disorder. He did not, however, believe that Scolman had, as Miller had concluded, schizotypal personality disorder or a psychotic disorder. “There were not observable indications that he was laboring with active psychosis,” Seipel said. There was also no indication in the Department of Corrections’ records about Scolman, dating back to 2007, that he had ever shown physical signs of psychosis, the psychologist testified. Saunders pointed out that there was no mention of discussion of “faceless people” or Scandinavian gods in Scolman’s mental health records prior to the homicide. Seipel additionally noted that Scolman had a \"well-documented history of racial prejudice.\" Other prosecution witnesses also testified Wednesday about Scolman’s demeanor the day of the crime: - A prison therapist who spoke with Scolman later in the morning after he attacked Nabors and Washington said he was unusually “cheerful, smiling, talkative” when they talked — moreso than she had ever seen him in the multiple visits they previously had. - A prison captain who rode next to Scolman as he was transported from Green Bay Correctional Institution to Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in Boscobel later in the day of the attack said Scolman’s demeanor the whole ride was calm, and they even discussed books and movies. - The prosecution played a video of a Green Bay Correctional Institution captain’s body camera while he spoke with Scolman hours after he stabbed Nabors. Scolman had a calm demeanor, even joking with the captain at one point that the correctional officer who pepper sprayed him “got (him) good.” RELATED: Trial begins for prisoner accused of hate crime in stabbing death of Black inmate at Green Bay prison RELATED: 1 week before trial, hate crime charges added in Green Bay prison homicide case Legal definition of mental disease or defect is narrow The jury’s decision in the second part of the trial essentially determined if Scolman would be sentenced to life in prison for his crimes, or if he would receive a sentence involving treatment in a mental health institution. To reach their verdict, Wisconsin law %20A%20person%20is%20not,to%20the%20requirements%20of%20law.) required the jury to consider two factors: the first, if Scolman had a mental disease or defect, as defined in state law, at the time of the crime. If they had said yes to that, they would have then needed to make a decision as to the second factor: whether that mental disease or defect caused Scolman to lack \"substantial capacity to either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or conform his or her conduct to the requirements of law.\" However, the jury concluded there was not enough evidence supporting the argument that Scolman had a mental disease or defect. In jury instructions, Brown County Circuit Court Judge Donald Zuidmulder explained mental disease or defect \"identifies a legal standard that may not exactly match\" the definition described by medical professional. The legal definition does not include a diagnosis that only has symptoms of \"repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct\" — so antisocial personality disorder, attorneys explained, does not qualify. It also cannot be used as a defense for a \"temporary frenzy or passion fueled by hate.\" Contact Kelli Arseneau at 920-213-3721 or [karseneau@gannett.com](mailto:karseneau@gannett.com).

    "title": "California Appeals Court Finds Employer’s Arbitration Agreement With Cost-Sharing and Out-of-State Law Provisions Unconscionable",
    "text": "In a recent ruling, a California appeals court found an arbitration agreement with an eyewear store employee that was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis required an arbitrator to apply the laws of another state, required that arbitration be conducted in another state, and forced the employee to share arbitration or mediation costs with the employer was unconscionable, and thus unenforceable. Quick Hits On May 20, 2024, a panel for California’s Fourth Appellate District issued a unanimous, unpublished decision in Dopp v. Now Optics, LLC, affirming a lower court’s decision that found several of the provisions in the arbitration agreement made it both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and thus unenforceable. The ruling highlights how courts, at least in California, are scrutinizing employers’ arbitration agreements and declining to enforce such agreements when they contain substantively unconscionable provisions that go beyond merely requiring that disputes between employers and employees be resolved through binding arbitration—such as choice-of-law clauses, forum-selection clauses, confidentiality provisions, and provisions requiring sharing of costs and fees. Factual Overview Allison Dopp, who previously worked at Now Optics, LLC’s, retail stores in San Diego County, California, from 2019 to 2021, brought a lawsuit against the company and related entity Vision Precision Holdings, LLC, as well as two supervisorial employees, asserting class action claims for meal and rest period violations and overtime violations, as well as various individual claims, including wrongful discharge and violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The defendants moved to compel arbitration relying on an arbitration agreement that Dopp electronically signed along with other onboarding documents when she was hired. Dopp opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The trial court agreed with Dopp and denied the defendants’ motion. The defendants appealed. Procedural Unconscionability The Fourth Appellate District held that the arbitration agreement with Dopp was procedurally unconscionable for two reasons: Substantive Unconscionability The Fourth Appellate District Court agreed with the ruling by the trial court that six provisions of the arbitration agreement were substantively unconscionable: Based on the six substantively unconscionable provisions in the agreement, the court found that the arbitration agreement “register[ed] high on the scale of substantive unconscionability.” Severance The appellate court further found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in declining to sever the unconscionable provisions and enforce the remainder of the agreement. In reaching that conclusion, the appellate panel noted the six substantively unconscionable provisions “systematically operated to deprive Dopp of valuable rights and remedies as a California employee” and that the agreement was “permeated with too high a degree of unconscionability for severance to rehabilitate.” Key Takeaways Recognizing that courts are likely to characterize arbitration agreements between employers and employees as contracts of adhesion, employers may want to consider avoiding provisions that could tip the scale in favor of unconscionability. Such provisions may include those that require employees to share in costs and fees of arbitration or pre-arbitration mediation. Moreover, employers may want to exercise caution before including choice-of-law and forum-selection clauses in arbitration agreements that would apply the law of, or require arbitration in, a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction where the employee is employed, or provisions mandating that arbitration remain confidential.

    "title": "Expert Explains Why XRP Could Have Highest Potential in This Bull Market",
    "text": "Amid the ongoing crypto bull run, prominent analyst Ben Armstrong boldly declares XRP as the coin with the greatest potential to soar. Despite recent setbacks in XRP’s price action, Armstrong remains unwavering in his optimism. He cited several factors driving his conviction.\nBen Armstrong Optimistic about XRP Despite Challenges\nOver the past 24 hours, XRP has shown a modest gain of 2.11%, accompanied by a remarkable surge in trading volume exceeding\n$1.43 billion. This uptick coincides with Bitcoin reclaiming the $72,000 price level.\nHowever, over the past 30 days, XRP has recorded a 4% price decline. The token is also more than 60%\nbelow the performance of the top 100 digital assets during this bull season.\nDespite these challenges, Armstrong\nremains bullish on XRP’s prospects. He points to the narrative surrounding real-world asset (RWA) tokenization as a key driver of its potential.\nNotably, Ripple is advancing beyond crypto payment solutions. It aims to tap into the RWA tokenization market, which has been projected to reach a staggering $16 trillion within the next six years.\nMoreover, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has\nexpressed confidence in the prospects of XRP Ledger (XRPL). He stated that the XRPL will become the preferred platform for RWA tokenization by 2025, further supporting Armstrong’s outlook.\nArmstrong sees XRP benefiting hugely from Ripple’s RWAs tokenization efforts. So, the pundit firmly believes that the token is primed for significant gains in the current bull run.\nLooking ahead, Armstrong anticipates further positive developments within Ripple. These include the resolution of the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, Ripple’s potential IPO, and the potential adoption by major U.S. banks.\nAdditionally, he highlights the possibility of prominent asset managers launching spot XRP ETFs, further fueling XRP’s upward trajectory.\nRipple’s CEO Cites Key Points to Support XRP Optimism\nArmstrong is backing up the positive XRP outlook with some promising events surrounding the token. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, alongside David Bchiri, CEO of Xrpl Commons, shed light on these events during the Paris Blockchain Week.\nThey delved into various topics surrounding Ripple and the broader XRP ecosystem. Their discussions ranged from the possibility of a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US to Ripple’s plans of launching a USD stablecoin this year.\nThey also drew attention to community expansion efforts and the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Notably, during his speech, Garlinghouse\nstressed the importance of diversification in crypto investments. He advised investors to consider a diversified portfolio rather than solely focusing on Bitcoin or XRP.\nHe further highlighted the regulatory clarity that XRP shares with\nBitcoin in the US, seeing it as a key advantage that could open doors for financial products like ETFs in the future. Although there are potential delays in altcoin ETFs, Garlinghouse remains hopeful about their future, particularly for XRP.\nQuestion & Answers (0)\n[Post your Question](#respond)",

    "text": "Ukrainian women continue to stand up against Russian aggression and speak up for justice and peace: UK statement to the OSCE\nIn the lead up to International Women's Day, Ambassador Holland notes the bravery of Ukrainian women and girls as Russia's senseless war has devastating impacts on them.\n7 March 2024\nThank you, Madam Chair. This week in the lead up to International Women's Day, we have been celebrating the accomplishments of women across the world. With that in mind, today I wish to highlight the courage and resilience of Ukrainian women, as they continue to stand up against Russian aggression and speak up for justice and peace.\nOver the past two years, Russia's senseless war has had a devastating impact on the lives of Ukrainian women and girls. Families have been torn apart, with many women suddenly becoming sole caregivers and providers. Mothers have faced the difficult decision to send their children to safety, while they remain in a warzone. Others have had their children forcibly taken from them. Many women and girls that remain in Ukraine have faced further trauma, with Russian forces committing terrible atrocities against them. And others have had their lives tragically cut short.\nThe wide-spread impact of Russia's war on Ukrainian women cannot be ignored. And yet despite this, we continue to hear stories of women who symbolise hope and resilience. Such as, Vera Lytochenko, a violinist who decided to stay in Ukraine and play music for people hiding in bomb shelters to lift their spirits and soothe the frightened children. Or Iryna Yurchenko, a train conductor, who since the start of Russia's war has helped evacuate people to safety with great bravery.\nUkrainian women have played a crucial role in defending their homeland with thousands of women serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, others have been instrumental to humanitarian, political, and security efforts. And Ukrainian women have refused to be silenced, coming forward with courage to document the horrific atrocities Russian Forces have committed against them, including sexual violence and torture.\nTo ensure justice is delivered, the UK has provided over Â£6 million to support projects aimed at building the domestic capacity of war crimes investigations. This has helped to embed international guidelines and best practice, including on survivor-centred approaches, through projects under the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group and work by the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative Team of Experts.\nThe UK has also been working closely with Ukrainian actors involved in tackling conflict related sexual violence, including First Lady Zelenska who we were pleased to welcome to the UK last week. The First Lady's visit provided an opportunity to reflect and discuss collaboration with her Foundation on mental health and psychosocial support.\nThe UK is proud to be a leading donor in supporting Ukrainian women, girls, and the most excluded groups. In recognition of their vital contributions on the frontline and in their communities, the UK set up new funding last year to provide critical support. This included helping the Ukrainian Women's Fund and local women-led organisations deliver live-saving services. Our support has also addressed the needs and priorities of the most marginalised, including internally displaced persons, Roma, and older persons.\nMadam Chair, the UK will continue to support the women of Ukraine as they work to rebuild their homeland from the damage and devastation of Russia's war. We remain deeply humbled by their remarkable bravery and we stand united with them. Thank you.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

    "text": "The northern region of New Jersey could get a light coating of snow possibly mixed with freezing rain Sunday night, Dec. 15, and early Monday, Dec. 16, according to weather forecasters. National Weather Service\nBy Len Melisurgo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Parts of New Jersey could get a light coating of snow or a wintry mix at the tail end of the upcoming weekend, posing a risk of some slippery roads, the National Weather Service said.\nA weak storm system is expected to arrive in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey either Sunday evening or Sunday night, with temperatures cold enough to support some snow in areas near and north of Interstate 78, the weather service said.\nSome computer guidance models are projecting “a fairly long duration” of precipitation, but the storm system shouldn’t have much moisture.\n“So even for areas that see a period of wintry mix or even all snow, snow accumulation should be light,” the weather service’s Mount Holly forecast office said.\nAs of Friday afternoon, the weather service was predicting less than 1 inch of accumulating snow in Sussex, Warren and Passaic counties, along with northern sections of Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset counties.\nThe weather service’s New York regional office says there is a possibility of icy roads during the Monday morning commute in parts of northeastern New Jersey.\n“A light coating of snow and/or sleet is possible on untreated surfaces,” the agency said. “Locally icy conditions are possible due to cold ground temperatures and a possible mixing with rain and/or freezing rain.”\nAreas outside of northern New Jersey are expected to see light rain Sunday night and more light rain during the day on Monday.\nCurrent weather radar\nStories by Len Melisurgo Feds question whether N.J. drone sightings are real.
