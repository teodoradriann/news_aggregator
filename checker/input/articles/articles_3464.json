    "text": "Canada Post has released a stamp featuring Middle Eastern cookies to commemorate an annual festival that marks the end of a holy month for Muslims. The Crown corporation said Thursday that Canadians can use the stamps to send greetings ahead of Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic festival in April that follows Ramadan, a holy month many Muslims spend fasting from sunrise to sunset and volunteering for charities. The stamps feature cookies called maamouls that are baked and consumed by Muslims across the world during times of celebration and can be traced back to ancient Egypt. “Melt-in-your-mouth cookies stuffed with a delicious walnut, pistachio or date filling, maamoul are a sweet staple during Eid celebrations,” Canada Post wrote in a statement. “The stamp was issued today, so that it can be used to send greetings before the festival.” Canada Post said its latest stamp is the sixth one it has released to commemorate Eid. “The Eid stamp is one of several stamps Canada Post issues each year to mark annual celebrations important to Canada's culturally diverse population - others include Diwali, Hanukkah and Christmas,” it said. Canada Post said its latest stamp can also be used to celebrate the Muslim festival called Eid al-Adha in June, which marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.",

    "title": "Opinion: 'Women Forward NYC' Can’t Succeed While the Mayor Cuts Child Care",
    "text": "There is no equality without affordable child care. Yet despite claiming to stand up for women, since entering office, the mayor has made cut after cut to pre-K and 3-K — programs that have been proven to help women enter the workplace and thrive. This week, the mayor announced a plan to [help women thrive](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1750267114680709631?s=20) in New York City through a series of new programs and initiatives. Unfortunately, the mayor’s latest investments in gender equity are one step forward after ten steps back. [In the past six months alone](https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/01/17/eric-adams-school-funding-cuts-less-than-expected/) the mayor has announced over $170 million in cuts to pre-K and 3-K — two critical services that keep women in the workforce, improve gender equity, and help build our city’s economic power. There is no equality without affordable child care. Yet despite claiming to stand up for women, since entering office, the mayor has made cut after cut to pre-K and 3-K — programs that have been proven to help women enter the workplace and thrive. Right now, mothers still take on the lion’s share of child care responsibilities, contributing more than seven hours per day to child care, while fathers take on [less than five](https://www.benefitnews.com/list/ways-employees-spent-their-time-during-the-pandemic). It is no surprise then that women are [four times more likely to miss work because of child care](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/childcare-work-absences)) than men. When child care is available, the situation changes completely: [maternal employment increases](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/effects-universal-preschool-washington-d-c/). I co-founded New Yorkers United for Child Care in November to bring together families who are alarmed by the cuts to our city’s universal pre-K and 3-K systems and understand the value of free child care for all kids under five. Since launching just months ago, we have collected over 1,000 petition signatures and stories from New Yorkers, predominantly women, who have shared how barriers to child care have impeded them from taking better job offers, advancing in their careers, and realizing their dreams. A mom from Brooklyn wrote, “I have had to turn down more lucrative work endeavors because I need to be home more.” Another wrote in, “I am currently scaled back from work in order to provide after-school and infant care for my two children. Previously I was full time.” One statement from women resonated again and again throughout the surveys: “I had to quit my job because we couldn’t afford daycare.” These testimonies are borne out in the data, which shows that mothers [are more likely to have part-time, less well-paying jobs](https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/). [And by the city’s own estimates](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/office-of-the-mayor/2022/Childcare-Plan.pdf)), two-thirds of the people who have downshifted careers or left the workforce for caregiving responsibilities since COVID-19 are women. On the other hand, New York’s once-thriving pre-K and 3-K programs did wonders for women’s participation in the workforce in New York City. [The Robin Hood Foundation found](https://www.robinhood.org/wp-content/themes/robinhood/images/poverty-tracker/pdfs/POVERTY_TRACKER_REPORT44.pdf)) that mothers who lived in school districts with greater 3-K availability were more likely to be in the labor force and more likely to be full-time employed than those in districts with lower 3-K availability. And universal child care programs across the country and the world have helped more women enter the workforce as well. [In D.C.](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/effects-universal-preschool-washington-d-c/), maternal employment increased by 10 percentage points after the introduction of [universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/effects-universal-preschool-washington-d-c/). In Quebec, where no family pays more than $10 a day for child care, [the rate of women aged 26 to 44 in the workforce is the highest in the world](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-31/affordable-daycare-and-working-moms-the-quebec-model)). Quebec’s program is being expanded to the rest of Canada, where they’ve found that it [is helping women enter the workforce,](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/child-care-keeping-women-out-of-workforce-despite-covid-rebound-report-1.1929386) so much that they’re seeing the results in payroll tax receipts– [the program paid for itself](https://www.vox.com/24002791/child-care-daycare-canada-parenting-children-policy) because more women were able to work. Mayor Adams’ “Women Forward NYC” plan aims to “make New York a better place for women to work, live, and thrive.” But the data is clear: we need universal, accessible pre-K and 3-K to ensure every woman can enter the workforce—and the mayor is taking an ax to these critical programs. It’s time for City Hall to reverse the cuts, fully fund pre-K and 3-k, and invest in a robust outreach and public advertising operation so that every family in every community can easily access these services. The mayor cannot promise to move women forward, while taking active steps that will hold women back. Rebecca Bailin is the executive director of New Yorkers United for Child Care.",

    "title": "Diet mistake is making you wake up 'exceptionally' hungry, expert warns",
    "text": "The world of weight loss can often seem daunting.\nMediterranean diets, intermittent fasting, and carnivorous meals have all made headlines in recent years, yet it can still be challenging to determine which plan will be effective. However, Professor Tim Spector and Dr Sarah Berry suggest we might be overlooking something crucial.\nInterestingly, a common habit could leave you feeling extremely hungry upon waking - and it's possibly something you've never considered. In a recent\n ZOE podcast episode, Dr Berry explained: \"There was a really interesting study that came out last year that I think really nicely illustrates what's going on by eating late in the day.\n\"And in this study they gave people exactly the same food over exactly the same time period, but half of the people had the food slightly earlier in the day and the other half had the same food slightly later in the day.\n\"...Those people who were having it later in the day, despite eating late in the evening, woke up the next morning lots more hungry than the people who were finishing their food a lot earlier in the day.\"\nDr Berry continued to highlight two 'unfavourable' effects of this. The most obvious being that you wake up very hungry - an unpleasant sensation that could potentially prompt you to eat more than you would otherwise.\nEating late at night could be messing with your internal clock and how your body processes food with\nr esearch from 2022 suggesting that dining right before bedtime might boost weight gain and increase diabetes risk.\nAt the time, Dr Joseph Bass, a co-author of the study, said: \"Simply placing an animal in a high fat diet environment will lead to disruption of the clock system. And this has important implications because it suggests that clocks, although they are intrinsic and cause us to awake each day at a certain time, are also sensitive to our dietary environment.\"\nAs a result, Professor Spector recommends steering clear of food for at least 12 hours overnight. On the podcast, he explained: \"There are a number of reasons for this. One is that the body needs time to recover and that it's part of our circadian rhythms, so all the cells in our body have the same 24-hour clock.\n\"They have periods of work and then rest and then repair, so all the cells are repairing during that time. They don't want to be confused with new food being sent down...\"\nAside from this, eating earlier in the day can improve your blood sugar control, hormonal balance and quality of sleep, according to\nHealthshots.\nProfessor Spector continued: \"Our gut is exactly the same. So, our gut microbes completely change composition when we're not eating. They send out like a cleaning team that goes and cleans up our gut lining and that improves our efficiency and everything's clean and ready for the morning.\"\nWhat do you think?

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#5](c5#c-5) En realidad este discurso en concreto se parece más al del ISIS que al de Hitler.\nAunque el resultado de ambos sea el mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
