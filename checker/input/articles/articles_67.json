    "title": "South Korea to intensify labour inspections to tackle rights violations against migrant workers",
    "text": "Seoul, Aug 8 : The Labour Ministry of South Korea announced Friday it will step up labour inspections to address concerns about human rights violations against migrant workers, including a three-week special reporting period for rights violations involving migrant workers.\nThe latest move comes following public outrage over a video showing a Sri Lankan migrant worker being lifted while bound to a forklift at a brick factory in Naju, about 280 kilometres south of Seoul.\nFrom August 11 to 29, the ministry will conduct intensive inspections of workplaces that employ large numbers of foreign workers, focusing on rural areas with poor conditions.\nStarting August 20, it will also designate every Wednesday as a special reporting and counseling day. Labour attorneys and interpreters will be stationed at employment centres to provide one-stop services to assist the labourers in filing complaints, Yonhap news agency reported.\nThe ministry said it will send text messages to all employers and workers to guide them on how to seek counseling and file complaints on any rights violations.\nEarlier in the day, Labour Minister Kim Young-hoon visited a farm in Wanju, North Jeolla Province, to inspect the working conditions amid a heat wave and to hear directly from foreign workers about their challenges.\n\"Promoting the labour rights of foreign workers without discrimination is one of the most urgent tasks in our society, and any form of human rights abuse, such as harassment and violence, cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,\" Kim said. \"We will come up with comprehensive measures to protect the rights of foreign workers and eliminate discrimination against them.\"\nPresident Lee Jae Myung pledged stern actions against any mistreatment of foreign workers as he shared the video of the Sri Lankan worker on his Facebook page last month.",

    "title": "Falcons get ‘a slap on the wrist’ from NFL in tampering case",
    "text": "The Falcons will forfeit a fifth-round pick in the 2025 draft and were fined $300,000 for violating the league’s Anti-Tampering Policy following a three month-long investigation, the NFL announced Thursday.\n“This penalty was a little light given the last time I remember tampering during the 48-hour free agency period was the Chiefs and Jeremy Maclin,” CBS Sports business analyst Joel Corry said. “The facts line up, and the (Chiefs) got docked a third-round pick and a sixth-round pick.”\nThe Falcons may have benefitted from cooperating with the league.\n“I’m going to make the assumption that they found Kansas City’s conduct more egregious than Atlanta’s,” said Corry, an Emory graduate. “Some people were expecting much harsher penalties. But the Falcons are only giving up a Day 3 pick. That’s more of a slap on the wrist.”\nThe investigation was related to contact with free agents quarterback Kirk Cousins, wide receiver Darnell Mooney and tight end Charlie Woerner during the two-day negotiating period before the start of the 2024 league year.\nIn addition, the Falcons were fined $250,000, and general manager Terry Fontenot was fined $50,000.\nFalcons owner Arthur Blank, president Greg Beadles and Fontenot were “unavailable” to comment on the matter, according to a team spokesperson.\nThis was the second time in six months that the Falcons were cited for a rules violation by the league office.\nIn December, the NFL fined the Falcons $75,000 and then-coach Arthur Smith $25,000 for violating the NFL injury-reporting policy before the club’s Week 7 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After going 7-10 for the third consecutive season, Smith was terminated after the season.\nIn its announcement of the penalties, the NFL said that regarding the improper contact the “club acknowledges took place with regard to these three players.”\nWhile no official from the team was available for comment, the Falcons issued the following statement on the penalties.\n“We are pleased this review is complete. We cooperated fully with the league and its review, and appreciate the NFL’s thoroughness. As we do with every process, we will review how we operate and look for ways to improve.”\nThe Falcons signed Cousins to a four-year contract worth up to $180 million March 13. The NFL reviewed the signing for possible tampering violations.\nIn his introductory press conference, Cousins indicated that he had met with the Falcons’ training staff and public relations staff the previous day, both of which would have been violations of tampering, as such discussions came before he signed.\nCousins also discussed talking with team executive Ryan Pace and then admitted to helping to recruit Mooney from the Bears. The Vikings did not file a complaint against the Falcons.\nIn the announcement of the penalties, the NFL wrote: “While the policy permits clubs to engage with and negotiate all aspects of an NFL player contract with the certified agent of any prospective unrestricted free agent during the two-day negotiating period, any direct contact between the player and an employee or representative of the club is prohibited. This includes discussion of travel arrangements or other logistical matters, which the club acknowledges took place with regard to these three players.”\nIn his first comments to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution since the signing of Cousins in April, Blank denied that the team tampered in violation of league rules.\n“The tampering deal, we obviously don’t believe we tampered,” Blank said at the league meetings in Orlando, Florida. “We shared all of the information with the league. They’ll review the process and the facts. They are in the middle of doing that. Whatever the result is, we’ll deal with it.”\nThe Philadelphia Eagles, who also were being investigated by the league office, will not face punishment related to their signing of running back Saquon Barkley, the NFL announced Thursday.\nTampering violations are considered serious by the league. For tampering with free-agent wide receiver Maclin, the Chiefs were stripped of their third-round pick in 2016, their sixth-round pick in 2017 and fined $250,000. Chiefs coach Andy Reid was fined $50,000 and then-general manager John Dorsey was fined $25,000.\nThe Chiefs were cited for “improper contact” before the start of free agency.\nWoerner’s agent was reached, but he had no comment on the matter.\nThe agent for Cousins had no comment and Mooney’s agent did not immediately respond to an interview request.\nWhile the fifth-round pick in near the end of the draft, the Falcons have had success picking in the later rounds over the past 10 drafts.\nIn 2015, the Falcons drafted defensive tackle Grady Jarrett in the fifth round (137th) overall and he has been named to two Pro Bowls.\nIn 2017, the Falcons drafted Damontae Kazee in the fifth-round (149th) and he developed into a starting safety.\nAlso, in 2022, the Falcons selected running back Tyler Allgeier in the fifth-round (151st overall) and he went on to break the franchise’s rookie rushing record which stood for 43 years. He rushed for 1,035 yards, which broke William Andrews mark of 1,023 yards, which was set in 1979.\nMost recently, the Falcons drafted linebacker JD Bertrand in the fifth-round (143rd overall). He’s expected to contribute on special teams.\nAbout the Author\nD. Orlando Ledbetter D.

    "text": "四川考生670分，目标是清北，目前已经接到北京大学招生办电话，北大这是不是掐尖招生？让130万河南考生情何以堪？\n6月25日晚间，四川公布高考分数线，普通类录取控制分数线如下：历史类本科批次467分；高职（专科）批次150分特殊类型招生录取控制分数线：533分。\n女生高考670分，北大招生组打来电话\n高考预估640分，实际670分，这就是学霸的代表。四川泸县二中考生陈小雨很兴奋，四川泸县二中历史类考生陈小雨高考取得总分670分的优异成绩。单科成绩分别为语文132分、数学126分、英语143分、历史87分、地理91分、思想政治91分。\n陈小雨表示，她此次高考成绩完全在意料之外。她表示，“预估的成绩在640分左右，没想过会考到670分。”尤其是语文科目“超常发挥”，平时测试在120分左右，高考考出了132分。英语作为她的强项，143分的成绩也稳居高位，这就是四川学霸代表。\n陈小雨表示自己的目标院校是清北，目前已经接到北京大学招生组的电话，意思是让她志愿填报北京大学。陈小雨表示，对于专业的选择，她需要认真考虑。\n陈小雨报考北京大学机会大吗？\n根据四川考试院公布的一分一段看，陈小雨高考670分，同分人数77人，在四川位次排名在748-824名之间。参考2024年录取数据可知，北京大学在四川录取最低分686分，位次在386名，志愿填报还没开始，北京大学招生组提前给陈小雨打电话，令人感到不可思议，如果陈小雨报考北大，能否顺利被录取，还是个悬念。\n陈小雨需要考虑，她的选择是对的。四川一个家长表示不满，他说，高考670就接到电话了？怎么可能？我干儿子也刚好670，全省排队800多，这个电话是否真实？值得再次确认。\n据了解，2025年四川省高考报名总人数为560370人，其中物理类考生327018人（占比58.36%），历史类考生233352人（占比41.64%），据悉，物理类691以上就有68人，根据北大历年在四川招生数量看，结合陈小雨在全省的位次分析，报考北大被录取的可能性不大，如果有特长的话，也不是没有希望。\n陈小雨班主任对她的评价是，她“心态稳、发挥稳”，高三以来始终保持优异的成绩，最终高考实现突破。这些能否作为优秀的表现无法定论，超常发挥的考生不少，被北京大学录取的人数不多，值得关注。\n网友：河南考生咋办？\n670分在河南位次如何？查询可知，670分在河南位列2300名左右。根据河南考试院公布的成绩来看，物理类：最高分710分，有12人，700分以上有108人，650分以上有8281人，600分以上有45887人。河南考生670分的高考成绩想接到北大招生组的电话，几乎就没有机会，更不用说填报志愿的事了。\n高考录取是否公平？我们常说，“清北是中国高等教育的天花板”。北大之所以成为北大，靠的就是对人才的极致渴望和尊重。他们要的不只是分数高的学生，更是潜力无限的未来之星。\n河南考生人数众多，各地名牌在豫招生人数有限，专业分布不公平。早就有代表建议名牌高校向河南加大招生力度。因为河南考生很优秀，缺乏的是资源和政策扶持力度。\n人多、考生多、优质高校少，是河南考生最大的心病。建议关注河南考生，高校招生向河南加大倾斜力度。\n声明：个人原创，仅供参考",

    "text": "Lamar County officials sworn in LAMAR COUNTY, Miss. (WDAM) - The sounds of the National Anthem opened the ceremony Thursday inside the Lamar County Courthouse where the county’s elected officials were sworn into their positions. Families packed the second floor of the courthouse as witnesses to a couple of unprecedented occasions. The first involved the members of the board of supervisors. “I think, for the first time in forty years, all five supervisors in Lamar County were re-elected, which speaks a lot for the guys I work with,” said District 4 Supervisor Mitch Brent. With all five supervisors still in place, Brent said the board is ready to hit the ground running in 2024. “We’ve got some big projects underway,” Brent said. “Currently, Highway 11 widening is going according; I think, even ahead of schedule. I think those guys are doing a really good job.” In addition to the board of supervisors, more history was made when Justice Court Judge Bill Anderson was sworn in for his tenth term, making him the longest-reigning elected official in the history of Lamar County. “It’s been a great honor to serve the people of this county for this many years,” said Anderson. Anderson credits his achievement to both his church and his community. “I’ve tried to do my best at all times in all honesty for all the people in Lamar County,” Anderson said. Elected officials will assume their roles on Jan. 1. Want more WDAM 7 news in your inbox? Click [here](https://www.wdam.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our newsletter. Copyright 2023 WDAM.

    "title": "República Dominicana premia el compromiso inversor de Ecoener por su contribución a la sostenibilidad y la economía del país - Faro de Vigo",
    "text": "Ecoener recibió el máximo “Reconocimiento a la inversión extranjera directa en la República Dominicana”, concedido en la edición 2024 durante un evento que tuvo lugar en la sede del Banco Central del país. La distinción, otorgada por ProDominicana (Centro de Exportación e Inversión del gobierno de la República Dominicana), premia la trayectoria y la aportación de la compañía presidida por Luis de Valdivia, en su apuesta por ampliar sus operaciones y contribuir positivamente al desarrollo económico y social del país. Durante el evento, se puso también en valor la contribución de Ecoener a la soberanía energética del país y en la lucha contra el cambio climático. El presidente de la República Dominicana, Luis Abinader Corona entregó el galardón al vicepresidente ejecutivo de Ecoener, Fernando Rodríguez Alfonso. República Dominicana ha experimentado un notable crecimiento, convirtiéndose en una economía de referencia en Latinoamérica. Su PIB ha aumentado entorno al 5% de media anual en los últimos años como destaca un reciente estudio del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). Rodríguez Alfonso agradeció este reconocimiento y manifestó que “la economía de República Dominicana está creciendo de manera sostenida y estable. Desde Ecoener queremos contribuir a este progreso invirtiendo y haciendo crecer nuestra compañía de manera sólida, como lo está haciendo el país”. En el acto estuvieron también presentes el ministro de Industria, Comercio y Mypimes, Víctor Bizonó; el ministro de la Presidencia, Joel Santos; la directora ejecutiva de ProDominicana, Biviana Riveiro, o el embajador de España en la República Dominicana, Antonio Pérez-Hernández y Torra, entre otras autoridades. En este momento, el plan de inversión de Ecoener en la República Dominica alcanza los 289 millones de dólares para la puesta en marcha de 5 parques fotovoltaicos que aportarán a la empresa 279 MW de potencia instalada. Dos de ellos, Cumayasa 1 y 2 (97 MW), se encuentran en operación desde el pasado mes de noviembre. Estas instalaciones producen el volumen de energía equivalente al consumo anual de 48.000 hogares, evitan la emisión anual de 140.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera y el consumo de 17.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles. Ecoener generó 300 puestos de trabajo en su construcción y la instalación de los paneles fue realizada mayoritariamente por mujeres, formadas y empleadas específicamente para ello. Cumayasa 1 y 2, que contó con una inversión de 100 millones de dólares, incorporan además una novedosa experiencia de agrivoltaica, en la que se combina la producción de energía solar con el pastoreo. Es un modo de implicar y favorecer la simbiosis de la compañía con la sociedad local, conjugando seguridad alimentaria y energética de manera equilibrada y respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Además de las instalaciones ya operativas, Ecoener está construyendo otras tres plantas fotovoltaicas en República Dominicana. Por un lado, Cumayasa 4 (62 MW), ubicada en la provincia de La Romana y donde la compañía está invirtiendo más de 63 millones de dólares. Por otro lado, las plantas Payita 1 y 2 (60 MW cada una), localizadas en el norte del país, y en las que Ecoener realiza una inversión conjunta de 126 millones de dólares. Estos tres activos de Ecoener poseerán una capacidad de producción anual conjunta equivalente al consumo de 93.000 hogares, evitarán el consumo de 34.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles y la emisión de cerca de 200.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera.",
