    "text": "El Gobierno del municipio Bruzual de Yaracuy inició la perforación de un pozo en el sector Sabana Larga de Chivacoa, que surtirá agua a más de 4.500 personas de dos comunidades.\nAsí lo informó este jueves el alcalde de la jurisdicción, Carlos González, quien mencionó que la obra fue aprobada por el presidente de la República, Nicolás Maduro, luego que los vecinos hicieran el correspondiente reporte al sistema 1×10 con la aplicación VenApp.\nRefirió que en unos 20 días, el pozo estará listo y en pleno funcionamiento, para surtir agua no solo a Sabana Larga, sino también a la comunidad de La Bartola.\nGonzález destacó que en ambos sectores la distribución del vital líquido ha estado bastante deficiente, por cuanto el pozo que servía de fuente hídrica a estas comunidades colapsó y se perdió definitivamente. Ante esta situación, los vecinos hicieron su correspondiente reporte VenApp y la Alcaldía de Bruzual respondió oportunamente.\n“Este pozo profundo se hace gracias a la VenApp, que es una extraordinaria herramienta ideada por nuestro presidente Nicolás Maduro, con la que el pueblo se comunica directamente con su Gobierno revolucionario”, destacó el mandatario local.\nComentó que con el pozo activo se beneficiará a toda la comunidad de Sabana Larga y La Bartola, que entre ambas suman más de 4.500 personas. La inversión para la ejecución del nuevo pozo asciende a 60 mil dólares, aportados por el presidente Nicolás Maduro, la Gobernación y la Alcaldía.\nGonzález explicó que el nuevo pozo proveerá aproximadamente 35 litros de agua por segundo, suficientes para atender la demanda de ambas comunidades, de manera más constante, con el debido racionamiento interdiario para poder cubrir ambos sectores.\nPor su parte, la jefa de comunidad de Sabana Larga, Verónica Chirinos, destacó que en la actualidad, las más de 2.100 personas que habitan el sector, solo reciben agua por tubería cada cuatro días y de manera muy deficiente.\n“Cuando el nuevo pozo entre en funcionamiento tendremos agua más constantemente en la comunidad y llegará a tres sectores donde, actualmente, solo la reciben en camiones cisternas una vez por semana. Esto es una bendición que agradecemos a nuestro presidente Nico, a quien desde aquí le decimos que cuente siempre con nosotros”, concluyó Chirinos.\nOtros pozos proyectados De igual forma, el regente municipal anunció que hay otros pozos planificados o en plena ejecución, como el de la comuna Rosa Luxemburgo, que se desarrolla con recursos del Consejo Federal de Gobierno. Este aportará agua a la parte sur de Chivacoa, específicamente a las comunidades Lambruchini, Ezequiel Zamora, Andrés Bello y Guacaipuro.\nTambién están en ejecución los pozos en los sectores 19 de Abril y La Montañita, para resolver el servicio de agua en ambas comunidades, se reparó el pozo del sector Cumaripa y se da mantenimiento permanente a las captaciones superficiales de agua.\nComentó que con los trabajos que se ejecutan, se garantiza el suministro de agua en casi 100 por ciento en todas las comunidades del municipio. “Vamos avanzando con soluciones efectivas para nuestro pueblo, con el apoyo de nuestro presidente Nicolás Maduro y del gobernador Julio León”, afirmó el alcalde.\nLos trabajos se concluirán en unos 20 días.

    "text": "Opinion: I’m a Christian who underwent IVF in Alabama. The state Supreme Court decision is devastating for would-be parents\nOpinion by Rebecca Mathews\n(CNN) — Having struggled with infertility, I’ve spent nearly all of the past 10 years focusing solely on creating life. Our two children were conceived in Alabama through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), the science of creating, freezing and attempting to implant embryos in my womb. And although IVF is very much a wonder of modern science, as a Christian, I believe it is a gift from God.\nBut last week, a majority of justices on the Alabama Supreme Court\nruled that embryos should be considered children, and that those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. The decision could have wide-reaching ramifications for adults across the country whose only remaining chance of creating a child is IVF, which involves creating and freezing multiple embryos. And it also leaves countless would-be parents in the state right now without a path to conceiving the babies they so desperately want.\nWe first turned to IVF after about a year of a different fertility treatment — intrauterine insemination (IUI) — which took me on a monthly roller coaster from optimism during ovulation to devastation when I menstruated.\nUnlike some people with infertility, I was relieved when my doctor recommended we move on to IVF, which has a much higher success rate. But my body was not done being cruel to my dream of motherhood. While I was able to give birth to my son, we had to use a surrogate to have another child — my daughter.\nDuring our excruciating IVF journey, we transferred a total of 12 embryos into my body, and I mourned the loss of all the ones that did not lead to a viable pregnancy. But if I regarded every one of my lost pregnancies as a living child, I might have permanently surrendered to the darkness and depression that engulfed me every time I miscarried.\nI have family members in heaven who I believe have embraced these lost babies — but they were never babies here. They were our attempt to create a child. Now the court’s ruling giving them personhood status will ironically make it impossible for others to do the same out of fear of potential consequences.\nFertility doctors in Alabama — many of whom have already suspended care in the state — might now wonder whether they can be charged with murder or subject to a wrongful death lawsuit. Women who miscarry an embryo implanted through IVF may wonder if their actions are illegal, and if so, whether they will be prosecuted.\nWe have one embryo remaining in a Birmingham fertility clinic and have considered donating it to be used for scientific research, which could help save lives or increase the chances of parenthood for someone else. But following this court decision, could we be criminally charged for donating a mass of cells, which only exist because we chose to create them?\nAs a Christian who has led a Bible study for women struggling with infertility, I am upset that the court’s chief justice invoked religion to explain his decision. In referring to a 2018 “sanctity of unborn life” amendment to the state constitution, Chief Justice Tom Parker cited the book of Jeremiah, writing, “It is as if the People of Alabama took what was spoken of the prophet Jeremiah and applied it to every unborn person in this state: ‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, Before you were born I sanctified you.’” Justice Parker also quoted Genesis, stating, “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.”\nI treasure the Bible’s teachings, and for us, creating embryos was the only path to fulfilling the Bible’s command to be fruitful and multiply. But I also know that it’s not my place to impose my religious beliefs on others, and I also know that religious beliefs are not the basis of law in our country. I’d like to know how many of the justices who conferred personhood on embryos know someone who had to create and miscarry multiple embryos in order to finally have a child.\nInstead of protecting life, the decision to equate frozen embryos with a living, breathing baby could end the practice of IVF and prevent millions of wanted and loved children from ever being created. In its zeal to uphold Christianity, the Alabama Supreme Court may have ended the dream of a family for millions of people who want nothing more than the chance to bring a baby into the world.\nOur daughter, who just celebrated her first birthday, is named after our fertility doctor and the wonderful woman who carried her for nine months. We, that doctor and her gestational surrogate all used the wonder of science to give her life. How devastating to think that if we were in the midst of IVF transfers right now, the court’s decision would have denied her the life she now lives with us.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Pierce Brosnan faces charges after allegedly walking in Yellowstone's thermal areas Actor Pierce Brosnan could be facing possible jail time after allegedly walking in Yellowstone National Park's hydrothermal areas in violation of federal law, according to court documents. Brosnan is facing citations of \"foot travel in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and \"violating closures and use limits,\" the court record shows. Criminal charges were filed against the Irish actor in Wyoming on Tuesday. [Federal law states](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-36/chapter-I/part-7/section-7.13): \"Foot travel in all thermal areas and within the Yellowstone Canyon between the Upper Falls and Inspiration Point must be confined to boardwalks or trails that are maintained for such travel and are marked by official signs.\" A representative for the 70-year-old Brosnan, who is best known [for his stint as James Bond](https://www.npr.org/2012/10/05/162175114/picking-the-best-bond-connery-and-craig-rise-to-the-top) in films in the 1990s, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment. What's the big deal? Within Yellowstone National Park's roughly 2.2 million acres there [are more than 10,000](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkfacts.htm)different hydrothermal features, like geysers and hot springs. The park provides many [guidelines and warnings](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm) online and throughout the park for visitors to be aware of the dangers posed by hot springs and the like. The park says, \"Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other natural feature.\" More than 20 people have died after entering or accidentally falling into Yellowstone's hot springs, [according to the park](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/thermal-basin-exploring.htm) because certain thermal pools can reach deadly temperatures of over 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, a number of visitors to the park, like allegedly Brosnan, [violate this law when they visit Yellowstone](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/22/video-shows-pair-leave-yellowstone-boardwalk-to-dip-fingers-in-175-degree-thermals/) — some incidents leading to serious injury or even death. In August, a 49-year-old Michigan man was arraigned in federal court for traveling off-trail in Yellowstone's thermal area. Jason Wicks suffered thermal burns and was banned from Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks until his criminal charges are resolved, [according to the park.](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/23034.htm) Other violators in recent years have [faced a week](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/210826.htm)to [a 10-day jail sentence](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/20001.htm), hundreds of dollars in fines and a lengthy ban from Yellowstone.

This aligns with India's commitment to sustainable practices in ocean resource management. The exploratory trials not only demonstrate the technical capabilities of Varaha-3 but also pave the way for future commercial mining operations. The Indian government has invested significantly in deep-sea mining technology as part of its Deep Ocean Mission, which aims to explore and utilise oceanic resources responsibly. As part of this mission, NIOT is also working on an integrated mining system that will enhance the efficiency of nodule extraction and transportation to surface vessels. This includes developing systems that can crush the nodules in situ and pump them to waiting ships through flexible riser systems. The successful trials in the Andaman Sea represent a crucial milestone for [India's ambitions in deep-sea mining. ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/video/what-is-deep-sea-mining-explained-in-a-minute-2402088-2023-07-05) With ongoing research and development, India aims to become a leader in sustainable seabed resource extraction while contributing to global efforts to meet rising demand for critical minerals needed for clean energy technologies.",

    "text": "Este sábado, las lluvias recientes y las condiciones climáticas más frescas ayudaron a más de mil bomberos en la contención de dos incendios forestales en el sur de Nuevo México. Estos incendios han resultado en la pérdida de vidas de dos personas, la destrucción de cientos de hogares y la evacuación de miles de residentes.Los bomberos utilizaron condiciones favorables, con temperaturas ligeramente superiores a los 21 grados centígrados (70 grados Fahrenheit), lluvias dispersas y vientos suaves. Emplearon excavadoras para cavar líneas de protección, mientras que equipos especializados creaban brechas cortafuego con palas en terrenos escarpados para combatir los incendios cerca de Ruidoso.El incendio South Fork, de 67 kilómetros cuadrados (26 millas cuadradas), estaba controlado en un 26%, mientras que el incendio Salt, de 31 kilómetros cuadrados (12 millas cuadradas), estaba controlado en un 7% el sábado por la mañana, según el Centro Nacional Interagencial de Bomberos.Según dicha agencia, no se prevé que haya una contención total sino hasta el 15 de julio.Los incendios forestales destruyeron o dañaron unas mil 400 estructuras. Otras consecuencias de los incendios (incluidas líneas eléctricas caídas, daños en las tuberías de agua, alcantarillado y gas, e inundaciones en zonas quemadas) siguen \"planteando riesgos para los bomberos y el público\", según una actualización el sábado publicada por el Departamento de Energía, Minerales y Recursos Naturales de Nuevo México.Las evacuaciones en áreas cercanas a Ruidoso y los cierres de carreteras seguían en vigor. A quienes viven en Ruidoso de tiempo completo se les permitirá regresar el lunes, aunque la vida cotidiana no volverá a la normalidad.\"Necesitarán traer comida para una semana, necesitarán traer agua potable\", dijo la alcaldesa Lynn Crawford en Facebook.Deanne Criswell, administradora de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias, y la gobernadora de Nuevo México, Michelle Lujan Grisham, tenían previsto recorrer la zona de desastre el sábado.El presidente Joe Biden declaró el jueves un estado de desastre para algunas zonas del sur de Nuevo México, liberando fondos y más recursos para ayudar en las labores de recuperación, incluido alojamiento temporal, préstamos accesibles para cubrir propiedades no aseguradas, y otros trabajos de emergencia en el condado Lincoln y en tierras pertenecientes a la tribu apache Mescalero.Gran parte del suroeste de Estados Unidos ha estado excesivamente seco y caluroso en los últimos meses. Estas condiciones, junto con el fuerte viento, hicieron que las llamas se salieran de control y que el incendio South Fork avanzara rápidamente hacia Ruidoso en cuestión de horas. Las evacuaciones se extendieron a cientos de hogares, comercios, un centro médico regional y el hipódromo de Ruidoso Downs.En todo el país, los incendios forestales han calcinado más de 8 mil 660 kilómetros cuadrados (3,344 millas cuadradas) este año, una cifra superior a la media de los últimos 10 años, según el Centro Nacional Interagencial de Bomberos.
