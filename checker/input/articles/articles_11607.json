    "text": "In an era where customer experience is paramount to business success, the role of customer feedback software in transforming client insights into actionable strategies is increasingly critical. This technology is revolutionizing how companies interact with their consumer base, ensuring that every voice is heard and valued. The evolution from mere complaint resolution to fostering commendable customer experiences is a journey many businesses are undertaking with sophisticated feedback tools.\nThe Importance of Real-Time Insights\nOne of the key aspects of this transformation is the ability to gather real-time insights. Platforms like Client Savvy enable businesses to capture feedback at the moment of experience, ensuring that the data is both relevant and immediate. This immediacy is crucial in understanding customer sentiment and taking prompt action, whether to address concerns or capitalize on positive feedback.\nDeep-Dive into Customer Opinions\nMoreover, these software solutions provide a nuanced understanding of customer opinions. Rather than relying on simple metrics such as satisfaction scores, advanced feedback systems delve deeper into the why and how of customer perceptions. This approach enables businesses to identify underlying trends and patterns, leading to more informed decision-making. For those keen to learn more about the impact of customer feedback on business excellence, have a peek at these guys .\nFostering Two-Way Communication\nA significant advantage of using customer feedback software is the facilitation of a two-way communication channel. Companies are no longer just receivers of feedback; they can engage in meaningful dialogues with their customers. This interaction fosters a sense of community and loyalty, as customers feel their opinions genuinely matter and contribute to shaping the products and services they use.\nIntegrating Feedback into Organizational Culture\nFurthermore, integrating feedback into organizational culture is a critical factor for success. According to realtimecampaign.com, businesses that actively incorporate customer insights into their operations tend to outperform their competitors in terms of customer satisfaction and loyalty. This integration goes beyond mere data collection; it involves a company-wide commitment to customer-centricity, where feedback drives innovation and improvement.\nThe Positive Impact of Customer Feedback\nThe journey From Complaints to Commendations: The Power of Turning Customer Feedback into Excellence is not just about addressing negative feedback but also about celebrating and building on the positive. Recognizing and rewarding positive customer interactions can be a powerful motivator for staff, encouraging them to consistently deliver excellence. This positive reinforcement cycle creates a culture where excellence in customer service is not just a goal but a norm.\nLeveraging Analytics and AI in Feedback Analysis\nThe use of analytics and AI in customer feedback software adds another layer of sophistication. These technologies can sift through vast amounts of data, identifying key insights that might be missed by human analysis. They can predict trends, suggest areas for improvement, and even personalize responses to individual customer queries or concerns.\nThe power of customer feedback software lies in its ability to transform raw data into meaningful action. It’s about moving beyond the traditional reactive approach to customer service and embracing a proactive, customer-first mindset. By leveraging these tools, businesses can navigate the intricate landscape of customer expectations, turning every piece of feedback into a stepping stone towards excellence. As companies continue to adapt and evolve in this customer-centric era, those who listen, understand, and act on customer feedback will undoubtedly lead the way.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Realtimecampaign.com\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 407-875-1833\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: Realtimecampaign.com\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "NHPR Reads: March 2024 To honor Women’s History Month, we chose a few of our favorite texts by extraordinary women. Not all of the extraordinary women authors out there, not by a long shot, but just a handful of favorites - this list could truly go on for miles. I spent a few years only reading books by women, and it was a time full of rich characters, true gems, bracing emotional gut punches, falling in love and getting my heart broken, and I cherished every page. I’d recommend it to everyone! Hopefully, this is a small place to start. If you add any of these to your indie bookstore order or your reading list, give us a shout at [voices@nhpr.org](mailto:voices@nhpr.org) - we’d love to hear what you think! - Sara Thank Your Lucky Stars by Sherrie Flick This collection feels like a treasure chest. Sherrie Flick's fifty stories range in length from a paragraph to a small handful of pages. Some read more like poetry, that you’ll finish and immediately have to read again. But no matter what, each story will leave you with the feeling that anything is possible and no wish should ever go unwished. - Zoë Bitter Orange by Claire Fuller A dying woman recounts the summer of 1969, when she struck up a beautiful but complicated friendship with a couple that aren’t all that they seem to be. Written in a gothic style, with occasionally jarring prose, Bitter Orange is a slow burn that gradually unfolds into mystery and intrigue. Who are we if not the stories we tell about ourselves? - Sara Tom Lake by Ann Patchett Tom Lake is a gorgeous sweeping novel about family, love, storytelling, and the role those stories take in shaping our own lives. Patchett’s biggest strengths as an author, to me, is her ability to effortlessly connect timeline and Tom Lake is a stunning example. I found myself daydreaming about the book for weeks after reading it. If possible, I recommend listening to the audiobook - narrated by the legendary Meryl Streep! - Zoë All’s Well by Mona Awad A magical, surreal text where a theater director, riddled with chronic pain and hopped up on meds, is determined to put on the play that ended her stage career. She receives an offer that might be too good to be true. All’s Well is funny and heartbreaking and weird. Mona Awad tells stories about women that are hard and occasionally heartless, but brimming with delight and surprise. - Sara Her Body and Other Parties: Stories by Carmen Maria Machado Queer fiction is a vital part of the literary world and Carmen Maria Machado is an extraordinarily important voice. This collection explores how women navigate a society that is obsessed with policing female bodies while men ask for more even after being given everything. Each sentence is meticulously and lovingly crafted. Machado’s haunting magical realism will stick to your bones (and mine!) for years to come. - Zoë A Darker Shade of Magic (series) by V. E. Schwab A mysterious man with a red coat, a brash and sassy lady pirate heroine, and four Londons, all in their own individual planes with their own forms of magic (or lack thereof). A rollicking fantasy series that will have you glued to the pages, rooting for Delilah and Kel as they traverse worlds together. - Sara Stranger Things Happen by Kelly Link “The girl detective must go to the underworld to solve the case of the tap-dancing bank robbers. A librarian falls in love with a girl whose father collects artificial noses. A dead man posts letters home to his estranged wife. Two women named Louise begin a series of consecutive love affairs with a string of cellists.” I didn’t think I could do better than the synopsis at encapsulating Kelly Link’s strange and touching tales. This is her first collection of short stories, and it’s the one that hooked me. - Sara The Secret History by Donna Tartt I am a sucker for dark academia novel, for an effete group of private school students getting above themselves and suffering the consequences. One of my all-time favorites, The Secret History is a gorgeous character study of seven unforgettable people who slowly descend away from traditional morality, while attempting to live more affected, intellectual, unordinary lives - and of course they’re all young adults. Tartt is masterful with every single word. - Sara Sara recommended this novel to me a while ago and I am so glad she did. As a former Classics student, this felt close to home in all the weirdest ways. You may not love all of these characters or even root for them, but they will certainly leave a lasting impression. Tartt’s lyrical prose even inspired me to pick up my own pen and paper and write a bit. I can not recommend this book enough! - Zoë The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers I unabashedly love everything Carson McCullers has ever done. She was a true master of the Southern gothic, and she rarely gets her due, like William Faulkner or Flannery O’Connor. McCullers suffered with profound mental illness, and even her warmest stories have a dark heart at the center of them. This one is no exception. It will make you feel things. - Sara The Father by Sharon Olds This chapbook is one that I not only love, but one I deeply connected with and found solace in at just the right moment. Sharon Olds writes plainly, a step-by-step description of death and the aftershocks. This book gave me permission to sob, laugh, and feel everything all at once, and I hope it can do the same for some of you. - Zoë NHPR Reads is a blog series published on the second Thursday of the month dedicated to poetry, prose, and everything in between. Follow along for a staff-curated list of what we’re reading that month and read along with us!",

    "text": "Mayotte L'archipel en alerte rouge cyclonique ce soir, des vents de 180 km/h attendus\nEn raison du passage du cyclone Chido, l'archipel est en alerte rouge ce vendredi soir à partir de 22h (20h à Paris). Le préfet appelle les habitants mal-logés à se rendre dans les centres d'hébergement du département.\nL'archipel de Mayotte sera placé en alerte rouge cyclonique ce vendredi à 22h (20h à Paris) en raison du passage du cyclone Chido, a annoncé le préfet de ce département français dans l'océan Indien. « C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h », a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse.\nLe préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, « seront ouverts à tous », a-t-il assuré.\nRafales, pluies intenses et vagues submersives\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un « cyclone tropical intense » explique Météo-France, qui prévoit « de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer ». Ces conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent « un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral » a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à « impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme ».\nAéroport et écoles fermés\nToute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22 heures et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20 heures (18h heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet. La dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17 h 30. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",

Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Arsenal tripped up the title race as they suffered a disastrous 2-0 defeat to West Ham United tonight (December 28). The Gunners' first home loss of the season means Liverpool sit two points above them in first place.\nThe Hammers are becoming somewhat of a bogey team for Mikel Arteta's side. They knocked the north Londoners out of the Carabao Cup earlier this season and also earned a draw at the Emirates in the league last season.\nDavid Moyes' men took the lead in the 12th minute, but in controversial fashion. Jarrod Bowen did well to keep the ball in play and he found Tomas Soucek who smashed home past Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.\nHowever, VAR took a long hard look at the goal regarding Bowen keeping the ball in play. The decision that was taken was that there wasn't sufficient evidence to reverse the on-field decision and the goal was awarded.\nThe Gunners tried to react quickly and Bukayo Saka saw his close-range header denied by West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola in the 30th minute. The woodwork then came to the visitors' rescue in the 42nd minute when Saka's right-footed effort hit the post.\nArteta wore a glum face as his side trudged off for halftime, it felt like it wasn't going to be one of those difficult nights. The hosts' job became even harder 10 minutes into the second half.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos came back to haunt his former club when he buried a powerful header past Raya. It came from an excellent corner from the magnificent James Ward-Prowse.\nArsenal looked to get themselves back into the game and Gabriel Jesus wasted two golden opportunities in the space of a minute. His first headed attempt was directed straight at Areola in the 65th minute and he sent another over the bar a minute later.\nThe Gunners then desperately appealed for a penalty when Saka went down following a challenge from Angelo Ogbonna. But, the English winger went down rather easily and as a result, no penalty was awarded.\nRice's miserable night went from bad to worse in the 90+5th minute when he stretched to intercept Emerson Palmieri in his own box. Referee Michael Oliver had no choice but to point to the spot.\nSaid Benrahma wasted the chance to earn a famous 3-0 win for West Ham when his penalty was denied by Raya. It was somewhat relief for Rice but the former Hammers captain is certainly not enjoying facing his old club.\nOne fan mocked Rice after he gave away the penalty:\n\"Declan Rice, thank you.\" Another fan thinks its a case of the same old story for Arteta's side:\n\"Arsenal back to bottling again. This is why you will never win the Champions League.\" Here's how fans on X (formerly Twitter) reacted to a disappointing defeat for Arsenal against West Ham :\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet",

    "text": "Astronomy enthusiasts are preparing for a rare cosmic spectacle: the alignment of the seven planets of the Solar System, a phenomenon that will not be repeated until 2040. The event will be visible with a telescope and, under certain conditions, even with the naked eye, depending on the brightness of each planet. Visible in recent weeks, the planets Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune and Saturn are joined by Mercury. In Romania, the planetary alignment will be visible tonight, in the last hours of February, according to specialized websites.\n• A rare spectacle in the night sky\nThe phenomenon, also known as the \"planetary parade\", occurs when several planets are apparently aligned in the sky. This is because they orbit the Sun at different speeds, and from a certain perspective on Earth they can appear to be arranged in an almost perfect line. \"Even in brightly lit cities, Venus, nicknamed the Shepherd Star, will be very bright, and Mars will be visible high in the southern sky, between the constellations Orion and Gemini. So will Jupiter,\" explains Jessica Lee, professor of astronomy at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London.\n• How can the planets be observed?\nFour of the seven planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye, depending on weather conditions. But for Neptune and Uranus, located very close to Jupiter, a telescope or powerful binoculars will be needed. If the skies remain clear, astronomy enthusiasts will be able to witness a spectacular planetary alignment, an event that will not occur again for another 16 years.",

    "title": "10 killed as rain batters Delhi NCR, death toll rises in Wayanad",
    "text": "Through late evening yesterday for National Capital and NCR, it was heavy rainfall and that went on for several hours and that has led to literally parts of Delhi drowning. And once again, if you&#039;re a Delhi resident, I must give you the information that schools have been shut in Delhi due to the aftermath of the constant rainfall, which has led to waterlogged streets and traffic snarls and a lot of inconvenience that people have had to face as well. The NCR literally, which means Delhi and nearby cities like Noida, Gurugram have also gone under in several areas, specifically the intersection points. In fact, in Delhi, I&#039;m informed that three buildings even collapsed after the deluge. You&#039;re looking at the aftermath coming in from Daryaganj and other areas, whether it it is these underpass subways, other locations, the building where the building also collapsed. Look at the traffic snarls because the sites completely waterlogged. And this happened while most people were returning from office to their home. This happened about 6:00 PM when it started and went on till about 8:00 to 9:00 PM. And then late night also there was rainfall again. So let&#039;s go to our colleagues on the ground as always, whether its a heat wave or its rainfall, India Today is on the ground to bring the viewer up to speed every morning. Ashutosh Mishra this time is joining me from Nizamuddin if I am correct. Ashutosh, on your way to work as well. What did you see? What kind of roads, what kind of arrangements? And I&#039;m pretty sure its Delhi. So its not its going to be political showdown. What is your information? What did you say around? OK, Ashutosh, I&#039;ll I think he&#039;s not able to hear me. I&#039;ll go across to you Ashutosh, if you can hear me. Yeah, I know I can. Go ahead. How was the morning like? What did you see around you by started from Noida and why are this NH 24? So clearly all these roads were clear because I believe after two or three o&#039;clock eventually there were no rain. However, still you see this thick cloud all over and this as a MET department, this looks like a most active, you know the monsoon activity that is being seen across a Delhi NCR, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Haryana. And clearly you know when it all started down pouring, within 15 minutes, all the roads were literally inundated. In fact, in the gym where I was working the part of top eventually Kolaya, so that was so much storm in the rain. But this morning when I started throughout the near Luton Delhi, most of these stretches were totally cleared because the water was already clear from these stretches. However, still I see water logging in at the ITO area because that believes to be a low line area. So if you are traveling from ITO towards Lakshmi Nagar towards Noida Ghaziabad, then we prepare because there eventually only one and one lane is active and other parts of the road is clear clearly in detail. So clearly one need to be very careful. However, if you&#039;re traveling from Noida Ghaziabad towards Delhi, its all clear as we speak. Since the order has been issued by the government, all private and government schools are closed today looking at the prediction of the heavy monsoon and the red alert that has been issued in Delhi. But we need to be very careful since its already alert issued until unless it is very important, very essential to travel, stay at home, do not travel outside because eventually all I see and if this continues and it similarly translates into the heavy downpour then all you see exactly the images that we have seen last night. But again all because we can clearly say that the drainage were not desulted, the cleaning were not taken place. All the agencies were totally reluctant. Despite the government order, the officials were reluctant, no actions were taken. There was wasn&#039;t any preparedness and despite multiple orders, action taken, reports sought, you know the audit reports were sought but the action were not taken. And even after what we have seen the disaster in old Rajendra Nagar, still the action has not been taken. If we say well, you know, the arresting of one person who was driving or some junior official, that&#039;s not the case at all because still the larger culprits are the biggest officials who are directly responsible to follow the orders of the elected government. And since often very such lapses, they are always protected and as long as really a lot growing because I understand there was also an unusual rainfall yesterday. It went on for hours. But you can north of the countries capital, start drowning in the manner parts of it has. There&#039;s been a lot of issues whether its about Urban Development, whether its about deserting simply. And that is the question that Ashutosh also is talking about. Ashutosh, stay on with me. Its the national capital and its flooded again. This is just days after three UPSC aspirants lost their lives, which was not of course rainfall. It was civic apathy. And then when we went back to Rajendra Nagar yesterday evening, we found it flooded again after hours of torrential rainfall. Students who had been protesting all this while were still protesting in the deep water outside Raos Coaching Center, whose owner has now been taken into custody. This comes 24 after after Delhi High Court wrapped the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for the work that was not done properly. The court said the MCD has become a joke. Taking a swipe at authorities, The court also said that they need to build a better infrastructure. Remember that amid all of this, people of Delhi was stuck in traffic for hours. One of the most active clouds is being seen over the skies in not Delhi but across NCR and hours of heavy downpour had resulted to waterlogging in several parts of Delhi including one of the area is the ITO road. And often because this is also being a low line area, often when there is a downpour we see such kind of situation. However, this was only few hours of rain and all you see the ITO Rd. not the entirely because rest of the part and other roads which connected to ITO light are clear. But this line being low line area if you see the length is nearly 150 meters is totally choked. The failure of the govern governance which has failed to desilt all the drainage system. However, the tall claims where the made. There is a conflict between the bureaucracy and the elected council of the ministers and amidst of all this is the suffering of the people in the national capital. The prime areas, the roads which are connecting litens Delhi are submerged inundated just by few hours of the monsoon shower at the ITO with Sanjay Kumar Sashdos Mishra for India Today, heavy rainfall flash the national capital bringing much required relief to an extremely humid temperature. The mercury was almost crossing 39.3°C in amidst this heavy rainfall brings a sigh of relief for those in the national capital. But with that, it also believes the problems of waterlogging in the national capital with video journalist Ankit decision today. Hi guys, look at me. This is Delhi in water in front of Siri Fort. I&#039;m walking because my car is stuck in the water. We live in the heart of Delhi. I have to go for a debate now and I&#039;m walking. Look, I&#039;m walking with my saree barefoot. This is Delhi and there&#039;s nothing one can do. Drains are all filled up. Terrible, terrible administration. This is not what we are paying taxes for. Terrible. So even politicians getting stuck and sharing video this time and Ashutosh is who I go back to right now. Ashutosh clearly because its Delhi and as always political showdown will all its already been on because of what happened in Rajendra Nagar. But what are you picking up for example, from the Delhi government because the focus is on them right now both as MCD and Delhi government that they are, they are leading right now. Because if this is going to be a repeated annual affair, this is going to become a lot of problems. Well, for more than a decade is going to be now. And every time we mention the Delhi government exactly the question comes which part of the Delhi government, whether we are talking about the elected government, whether we are talking about the bureaucracy because both are not working with each other totally. And the reason is very much known. And clearly remember the elected government which is the council of minister did agree there was failure. The additional Commission of the MCD in the court also agrees. Yes, there were a failure. But has there been any action? Last year there was virtually literally a flood. Entire deli was literally and there was then it was blaming over the Haryana authority. This year when there&#039;s a dry up, we have the blame that there is no water supply. But what happens during rain? We have the records of the meeting that there were meeting happening, the meeting were called, all preparations were talked about. But what had happened when the orders are issued, the orders are not followed and when the orders are not followed, what you see is happening on the roads in the national capital is happening, has happened in the past and even will happen even next year. The reason being is the main culp threats of such disasters, there is no action. Why there is no action? Because there is someone who&#039;s always protecting them, because if you ask the elected government take take action against those officials, they cannot take because there is no power. One who has all the power is the Lieutenant governor, but he has no accountability, he has no responsibility and all of that because of this fighting, all you see is the disaster. The people like you mean of administration in Delhi has, has in fact been an issue. There&#039;s been confusion consistently, but perhaps this time with MCD and Delhi government both being led by AAP, there will have to be some consensus they need to find on this because eventually its the common man on the ground who has to wade through this water literally risking their life. Remember, because one of the students lost life to the electrocution in one of these areas. Ashutosh, thank you. I&#039;ll come back to in just a short while. We have some news coming in from Kerala. Let&#039;s take a look at that. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra heading to Wayanad in Kerala where the massive landslide and reportedly cloudburst also had taken place. Remember Gandhis siblings had said that earlier the weather was inclement, it was not in support and therefore they would not be going. But we are told as these are the visuals of their vehicle leaving, the siblings have left for Wayanad. Remember, Rahul Gandhi had won as a member of Parliament of the Lok Sabha from Wayanad and also from Raibareli, which there was the constituency he eventually chose. But in many ways he realized that the people also voted for him. So even though he may not have that position and in many ways Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was was given that responsibility to be in that area, they have decided to be on the ground. Sadly, as we speak, death toll has risen to 170 people confirmed dead. Hundreds are still trapped in Wayanad landslides that have literally flattened many villages and areas there. Shibi Mole is joining me on the phone line. Shibi Mole has been reporting from Wayanad consistently about the aftermath and rescue operations. Shibi Mole, didn&#039;t they say that they wouldn&#039;t be going because of the weather or other reasons? And now they are on route. Kel, Keralao, what do you think really happened here and what is the situation on the ground as you&#039;re tracking right now? Well, Pooja, yes. Because you know, right after the incident took place, it was informed that Rahul Gandhi, Chandra Gandhi, both of them will be visiting Wayanad yesterday. But later they changed the, you know, plan saying that due to adverse climatic conditions, they will not be travelling to Wayanad. But yesterday evening the final confirmation came that, you know, today they will, both of them will visit Wayanad multiple times. They have, you know, expressed that Wayanad is like home and all of that. So it is very important for both of them to be here when going through the most tragic situation that the district and the state also has possibly faced. So we&#039;re hearing that both of them, as per the schedule will be visiting the relief camps and also the hospital where the, you know, injured have been admitted. They&#039;re very likely to visit the landslide site also. But it&#039;s, you know, there&#039;s a lot of difficulty in terms of security arrangement and all that to be in place for when both of them are visually considering the, you know, the security categories that they are placed at right now. So that will have to be that is not yet confirmed. Their planning is what the Congress workers and the Congress leaders are telling us. We are in Wayanad. As far as the rescue, rescue operations, it&#039;s going to start today morning around 7:30 and the rescue operations stopped yesterday by evening because whatever is to be done again can be done only after the daily bills construction is over. So the whole night the construction was going on, a very limited people were deployed at the place to finish the construction. So today morning by hopefully they&#039;re finished, I&#039;m hoping to finish it. It&#039;s going in very fastly. So probably few hours. It could be, you know, Shabin Mole, you know, as you&#039;re mentioning and we look at these visuals, just the aftermath that I&#039;m looking, that is horrifying to think what would have been once settlements are completely flattened right now. A lot of questions will also be asked about was it simply a natural disaster or was it in many ways man made as well? Over 170 people have been confirmed dead or should I say killed in many ways. Over 200 have received injuries. They have been rushed to the nearby health centers. Massive landslides. Remember multiple landslides that struck these hilly areas near Mepadi in Wayanad in Kerala right now, we are told hundreds of people are missing off your trap. This means there&#039;s a race against time specifically to rescue the survivors. And there are rescue personnel in large numbers in different parts of Wayanad. The army racing against time. Then there&#039;s the Navy, Air Force, there&#039;s the NDRFSDRF. Then there are local volunteers, local people of Kerala who have also come in to volunteer and help. But what has left because of that landslide is complete destruction. Houses destroyed, waterlog streets uprooted, trees swollen water bodies, life thrown out out of gear in Mundakai, Shurmala, Atamala and Nulpura villages in the wake of heavy rainfall in the district. We are told that landslide alert has also been issued in Kurumbakota, Lakhidi, Manikurumala, Motil, Kolapara Colony and other areas as well in Wayanad specifically around the district. But remember its been now more than 24 hours. Its going to be two days now in in the V hours of 30th July when multiple landslides struck Keralas Wayanad. Unsuspecting residents buried in their sleep. Race is on to find survivors now and the injured to be rushed to hospitals. This is a ground report coming in by my colleague Akshita Nandagopal on Ground Zero. This is a makeshift bridge constructed by army personnel near Churamala and you can see you have to use this ropes and cross this particular area to Mundakai. And you can see that army personnel, NDRFSDRF and everybody here trying to shift the people from one side of the river to the other to ensure that there is a safety passage for all those people who are struck on the other side of Mundakai. You can see how the river is gushing towards the other side and these are the problem faced by Indian Army especially the people who are here at the rescue point along with the other rescue persons. Vijay Rajesh Madhu Sagaraj reporting from Jhurmala, Kerala for India Today were making our way now towards Mundakai. You can see how treacherous it is. It is courtesy these army personnel that even this much is possible. Using barricades, wooden planks, they&#039;ve created this particular bridge here. Makeshift, obviously, I mean, the current goes up. This also is completely shut down. Let&#039;s make our way towards Mundakai now. Can you believe that where people are right now? This was a temple just about 24 hours ago. Actually, 36 hours ago was completely underwater. Now the water levels have come down, which is why you can see efforts to create more and more bridges so that people can come across. But from here its another at least 60 minute walk. I&#039;m going to take you through it to show you exactly what our personnel are going through, the kind of challenges that they&#039;re facing terrain wise, weather wise, as you can see, and still getting there to rescue every single person. This is exactly what the area of Mundukai looked like before the landslide happened. And I&#039;ve asked this question several times to several authorities about what triggered the landslides. Yes, natural calamity, but also deforestation, tea plantations all across this entire stretch as far as the eye can see. And it will lead to questions about whether that too, was one of the causes for the landslide happening in the manner that it did. Mundkai was this beautiful. Now what you&#039;ll see when I show you the landslide location will absolutely shock you because there&#039;s nothing left of this beauty. Let&#039;s keep going another 5 kilometers as we walk up. I&#039;ve been speaking to a lot of the people here and almost all of them are locals who&#039;ve come up to help. 8:00 landslide location, so all of them walking uphill saying several times they&#039;ve done it and continue to do so. They&#039;re not part of any organization any of that. They&#039;re locals who heard of the news and decided, look, amid disturrential rain, we&#039;re going to come here, do everything we can to help. Behind me is the entire stretch of the river there flowing through and you can see the rocks that is brought along as a result of the landslide. 2 days back when the landslide happened, the water was right up till here. Now it&#039;s receded and left behind all of that debris. Locals tell me that it was along this stretch the bodies were washed up. A lot of the bodies were found almost 2030 kilometers away from where I&#039;m standing, which is where the actual landslide took place. So you can imagine the amount of debris that really pushed all of these homes, bodies, families across to the very end. Even now at this point, rescue operations continue. You can see there are several officials out there, but its impossible really to sift through. Dig through all of that debris, that big mound behind me, its untouched so far. As we speak, bodies are being pulled out, so the rescue operation still very much continuing in many pockets where officials are reaching and realizing only now that the landslide is hit here too, that houses have been completely destroyed in many of these circumstances. And just the sheer nature of this tragedy can be summed up in the images I&#039;m showing you many of these circumstances. Locals tell me that they&#039;re not able to find more than body parts, but they&#039;re still treating it with the respect and dignity. I apologize for bringing you these kind of sensitive images, but this is the nature of tragedy that were actually dealing with where every 15 minutes another body is pulled out by the officials who are working here through the heavy rain from early morning till late into the night till sundown. And from here its at least one hour that youll have officials actually walking, actually walking right down to the spot where the ambulance can reach them. Because the ambulance can&#039;t come up to where we come. They have to trek all the way, say India Today, they have to trek all the way to the other side. And that&#039;s where the ambulance can actually take the mortal remains to a morgue. Still bodies are there, Sir. Still bodies are there and here overall we, we we don&#039;t know how much houses are there, but we can see 10 to 15 Ouch in this side. So still we are searching and we got right now 4 bodies. The people saying from here, people telling that there is some some more bodies. Thank you. Thank you for everything you&#039;re doing. Also for this, you can see the water flowing by in this particular area. There&#039;s water flowing through the entire location. People are walking by and helping in every way they can. But you heard the gentleman there who&#039;s been a part of the rescue operations. What they&#039;re doing here is nothing short of heroics. So many locals, officials risking their lives to come here in this pouring rain. You&#039;ve been seeing how its nonstop raining this entire stretch here. There&#039;s absolutely nothing left. And this was an area full of tea plantations, full of homes, nearly 400 families washed away as a result of these landslides. 2 days on, this is the second day of rescue operations. And looks like, based on what officials tell us, it could take a couple days more, especially because of the challenges they&#039;re facing with the terrain and the weather. With video journalist Sachin Chandog. This is Akshitan and the Gopal reporting for India Today from Wayanad Project News coming in from national capital Delhi. A woman and her child drowned in Delhi. A 22 year old woman and her child, we are told drowned in a waterlogged drain. This is days after three students had also drowned. Isn&#039;t this also negligence as well? That&#039;s again taken away two more lives this time. Its this time a young woman and her little child died in drowning in a waterlogged drain in the Ghazipur area. Legal action is being taken by Delhi by the Delhi Police, the police station Ghazipur E Delhi. The Delhi Police has given out a statement. So in one side buildings have collapsed, on another a woman and her child drowned in this Ghazipur dream. Absolutely heartbreaking images surfacing. Remember that there are waterlogged trees and it can get very dangerous. There has been one student who died of electrocution a few days ago. These waterlogged streets because you do not know if there&#039;s a pothole, if there&#039;s a drain, drain around you and how deep it could possibly get. And therefore only if necessary do venture out. Otherwise try to avoid the area specifically that would clearly be waterlogged. You see a coward here who has to brace through the knee deep water to be able to reach to an another destination. Himanshu Mishra gets us this big. Update himanshu to bodhi tragic news aye vaisal Ki aur tumka baccha to drown ho Gaye gazipur Mein ye kya update hai kaise woh waha poche pas Gaye or nikal nahi Pai. This is a big corporate SO sarasi aagi akka Delhi Mein abhi aaj sarko peja utre hai suba to kuch ghanto Ki Jo bare shui uske bajo water logging hogai pirse wahi muddha outra hai Ki kaise rajdhani me desh Ki is Tara ke incident Hooray hai. I or or fire service for Delhi fire for call Yeah different makan kidnar aja kidnar srivastava. If they quickly called it Vishya lava Ashara falls place Is your Delhi fire first? Who calls water locked in the fire service? Himanshu, thank you very much. Keep tracking. Look at these open drains. How can such open drains be kept like this in right now in the monsoon season? Clearly anyone passing through these are waterlogged areas will not even realize that there is this open drain and will most likely fall. Absolutely terrible. We&#039;ve lost 22 year old woman and a child because she basically as a mother jumped in to save her child. Both of them died. Tragic news coming in from national capital Delhi. A woman and her child drowned to death in Delhi. This is after the massive rainfall that took place, more than usual in fact and has led to a lot of water clogged drains. Look at this, clearly an open drain and for some reason parts of it because of the tower or otherwise were not covered. A little child fell into this drain. The mother jumped in to save the child. Both of them drowned and died. This is days after three students also remember lost their life in the basement of Rajendra Nagars coaching center. Isn&#039;t this negligence in several cases? That&#039;s literally taking away lives right now. This is countries capital. We are told that as per inquiry, it was found that the mother and child were returning home when the little boy, about three years of age, Priyansh slipped inside an open drain. One of these drains visuals on your screen. It was an open drain. It wasn&#039;t visible to them. It was waterlogged. The mother Tanuja jumped in as well. Rest to rescue the child. Both of them did not survive if I has been registered. But the fact is, why are these drains open? Where are the officials? Where is the government? Where is the MCD? How can you not know? In the area there are open drains that get waterlogged, can become invisible to innocent people. We&#039;ve lost a mother and a child and it appears nobody even cares at this point. Himanshu Mishra is joining me for the latest on this. Himanshu ikmar bache Ki death ho jatiya or yeah AAP mujhe samjhai swagt kyuki Rajendra Nagar mehbi lagraya Ki bise water logging hogai hai usita rasi jaise kuch change in a Hua hai. Ghazipur Mein kyahua Pele hame batai or dilli ke kya hala thei aad subha. We can ask subato Dali ke hala chiki kuja hopar rakhbat barish Banda ITO ram Leela or jagahi pani hai incident Barishi visibility kafi ka mogati barishi or sarak pani bacha or control chota 13 salka bachata visibility or koshi Vicki bachani kede lekin der ho kaithi jab Tak for nalise nikhal Pate donoko hospital poncha Pate Tak deru chukiti dono Ki Moto gaiti abis pure mamle PE Delhi Police kanaka fire dach kar ke pure mamle Ki jaj Ki jaagi Ki Ki kis Ki la par wahi hai. Khan is we have the images on the screen. Images of the mother and the child. A three-year old. In fact I am a mother to a three-year old child. So I totally understand the kind of possibly the loss, the grief, the shock that the family would be facing right now and a mother. Remember its a mothers instinct. The child falls, mother jumps in to save the child. And why and how are these drains open which are clearly death traps? Its unbelievable that people are dying because of negligence. There was no reason for these deaths to happen. Himanshu as we stay on this big story Kiskiyandar Yatay Pele to Delhi made. This is also a big confusion with multiple layers of administration. Does this go on the MCD? Does this go on the Delhi government? Then the Delhi government of AAM Aadmi Party say, but we gave the orders, officials did not listen. Then leftenant governor will come into the picture. Who is responsible for this mess of open drains? The KJ Puri J medari was civic agencies Kyoto civic agencies kya medari hotiya footpath selekar K drainage key surak cha Ki usko clean yahabad Delhi Police ka kana hai Ki is hase ke baat UN FIR or easily FIR investigation which is fixed particular jagati or kiski Hindu Moto kaji medar hai kon kiski la parwahi say ma or Bette Ki jaan gay is confix kanaki koshiki jarayo.

About 2223 years of age died saving her child because there was an open drain. Both of them of course did not see it. It was waterlogged. The child fell, mother fell in it too. There were locals, we are told in Delhi who tried to save the 2:00 but they could not and eventually they were declared dead. The fact is investigations are being done. Now the question is why couldn&#039;t work be done before the incident? The national capital has been flooded after a few hours of rainfall this days after three UPSC aspirant lost their ...",

    "text": "Jonas Aidoo Poised to Boost Arkansas Razorbacks in NCAA Tournament\nJonas Aidoo is poised to make a significant contribution for the 10-seed\nArkansas Razorbacks in the NCAA Tournament. With nine previous tournament games and a strong finish to the season, Aidoo is ready to leverage his experience to help Arkansas aim for its second championship. Despite a challenging season due to foot surgery, he has recently showcased impressive form, including three double-doubles in the last five games. Aidoo emphasizes the importance of teamwork and mental resilience as the Razorbacks prepare to face the Kansas Jayhawks, where he'll need to contend with standout center Hunter Dickinson.\n- Aidoo averaged 7.5 points and 4 rebounds in last year's NCAA Tournament.\n- He secured three double-doubles in his last five games, including a 21-point performance against Mississippi State.\nThe Razorbacks' success hinges not only on Aidoo's performance but also on the entire team's ability to execute their game plan against formidable opponents like Kansas, complicating the path to victory.State of Play\n- Aidoo is healthy and playing some of his best basketball after recovering from an off-season foot surgery.\n- The Razorbacks are looking to leverage their tournament experience to advance deeper into the competition.\nAs Arkansas prepares for their matchup against Kansas, Aidoo will need to limit Hunter Dickinson's effectiveness while continuing his own scoring and rebounding contributions to enhance the Razorbacks' chances of success.Bottom Line\nAidoo’s journey from uncertainty to playing pivotal minutes in the tournament highlights the resilience needed for success; if he can keep Dickinson at bay and maintain his confidence, Arkansas could make a serious run in the Big Dance.\nRead more at\n HawgBeat\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
