    "title": "In Nigeria and much of Africa, Catholic same-sex couples see no blessings soon",
    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA (Reuters) – Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican’s declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent’s most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican’s declaration will change much.\n“Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,” Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby’s proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope’s decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God’s children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n“There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,” said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n“I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,” she said.\n“We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.”\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)",

    "text": "A long-ago Kansas farm boy will share his new book at Kauffman Museum this Sunday.\nDavid Janzen, Evanston, Ill., will read from Once Upon a Time There Was a Three-Year-Old Grandpa , published this year, at 3 p.m. in the museum auditorium.\nCopies of the book will be for sale, and Janzen will sign books after the reading and discussion.\nJanzen was born and raised on a Kansas farm and graduated from Bethel College in the early 1960s.\nIn the early ’70s, he and his family were among the founders of New Creation Fellowship, now New Creation Fellowship Church, a Mennonite congregation in Newton.\nIn 1984, the Janzens moved to Evanston to join Reba Place Fellowship, an urban, income-sharing Christian community.\nSince then, Janzen has assisted in Reba Place’s refugee asylum project, served on the leadership team, directed an affordable housing ministry, and mentored leaders of a new generation of communities associated with the New Monasticism movement.\nHe is the author of several publications on Christian community leadership, including The Intentional Christian Community Handbook (2012) and Seven Radical Elders (2020).\nThe title of Janzen’s latest book, Once Upon a Time There Was a Three-Year-Old Grandpa , is meant to evoke a collection of bedtime tales first told to grandchildren.\nChapters begin with a farmer-boy story from the 1940s, an era before industrial farming, when horses, cows and chickens were still members of the family.\nEach anecdote launches a theme that splashes down with further development in later decades of Janzen’s life.\nDiverse topics include imaginative play, construction crew humor, animal intelligence, contemplative prayer and journal writing, rural and urban farming, communal wisdom, and affordable housing.\nThe book also “[reflects] on God’s in-breaking initiatives and the writer’s emerging sense of calling in lifelong conversation with Jesus,” according to its promotional material.\n“[The] stories offer a series of curiosity-driven on-ramps into eight decades of transformative experiences for curious souls to ponder an open-eyed faith and a communal way of life for the long haul.”\nRegular Kauffman Museum hours are Tues.-Fri. 9:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m., Sat.-Sun. 1:30-4:30 p.m., closed Mondays and major holidays. Admission to the special exhibit, “Unlocking the Past: Immigrant Artifacts and the Stories They Tell,” and permanent exhibits – “Of Land and People,” “Mirror of the Martyrs” and “Mennonite Immigrant Furniture” – is $5 for adults, $3 for children ages 6-16, and free to Kauffman Museum members and children under 6. The museum store is open during regular museum hours. See kauffmanmuseum.org or the museum Facebook page for more information.",

    "text": "Celebrity News Phil Collins Explains Why He Can’t Play the Drums After Health Issues: ‘I’ve Used Up My Air Miles’ By Johnni Macke December 19, 2024 Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Phil Collins. Gina Wetzler/Redferns Phil Collins will always love playing the drums, but years of rocking and rolling has taken its toll on his hands.\n“I’ve spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock,” Collins, 73, confessed in the Phil Collins: Drummer First documentary, which was released by Drumeo on Wednesday, December 18.\nThe musician explained that after playing drums in concert with Genesis for five decades and on solo tours since the ‘80s, it impacted his hands and legs. The strain on his body led Collins to retire from drumming in March 2022 after his last performance with his band Genesis.\n“If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything,” he said. “If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I’ll have a crack at it.”\nRelated: Phil Collins Retiring From Music Due to Ill Health \"I don't think anyone's going to miss me,\" says the singer “I just feel like I’ve used up my air miles,” Collins continued, noting that not being able to play was “still kind of sinking in a bit.”\nThe Oscar winner got his first plastic drum at the age of 3, which started it all. Two years later, Collins was playing music for his family. “It was something I could sit at, and I thrashed along to the TV set,” he recalled.\nLooking back on his career, Phil’s son Nic Collins said his dad was like many musicians of his time and didn’t think about what drumming would do to his muscles.\n“Musicians, people in bands in general had this thought that they were invincible,” Nic, 23, explained. “I think that’s really what it is with my dad is just this kind of sense of you’re a drummer, you’re invincible, you do what you do. But you don’t know it’s gonna take a toll in the long run.”\nRelated: Watch! Phil Collins Performs \"In the Air Tonight\" At Sons' Middle School Phil Collins came out of retirement for a brief moment to perform two songs with his sons' middle school band in Miami, Fla., recently -- watch the video In 2015, Phil underwent neck surgery that “stemmed from all those years playing drums and bad posture,” according to Nic. Phil also suffers from drop-foot, which is when one of your feet has no sensation. That ailment led to the singer using a cane.\nAhead of Genesis’ reunion, Phil announced that Nic would be taking over for him at the drums because of his health. He remained on as the lead vocalist.\n“I’d love to, but you know, I mean, I can barely hold a stick with this hand. So there are certain physical things that get in the way,” Phil told BBC Breakfast in September 2021. “I’m kind of physically challenged a bit which is very frustrating because I’d love to be playing up there with my son.”\nPaul Bergen/Redferns Phil hinted at the time that the tour could be his last. “We’re all men of our age, and I think to some extent, I think it probably is putting it to bed,” he teased. “I think, yeah, I think just generally for me, I don’t know if I want to go out on the road anymore.”\nPhil joined Genesis in 1970 as the drummer. The band consisted of bassist Mike Rutherford , keyboardist Tony Banks , guitarist Steve Hackett and singer Peter Gabriel . The group went on hiatus in 2000 but reunited in 2006 for the Turn It On Again Tour .\nPhil headed out on The Last Domino? Tour with Genesis in September 2021. His last show with the band took place in March 2022 with Nic on the stage with him and his daughter Lily Collins in the crowd.\nThank You!

    "title": "El paradís dels aperitius existeix (i s'amaga dins aquest mercat de Barcelona)",
    "text": "Hola hola, gourmters! Toca tornar al mercat, concretament al Mercat del Ninot, on entre parades històriques i clientela fidel, hi ha un lloc on l’aperitiu s’ha convertit en art: Perelló 1898, una casa centenària que ha sabut conservar l’essència dels inicis amb una mirada actualíssima. Perelló 1898 és una parada històrica fundada per la família Perelló a finals del segle XIX. Especialitzada en bacallà i aperitius selectes, la parada ha mantingut la tradició de la pesca artesanal i la qualitat del producte.\nLa història de Perelló 1898 és un testimoni de l'evolució gastronòmica de Barcelona, des de les primeres vendes de peix salat fins a l'actual oferta d'aperitius gurmet. La parada ha estat un punt de trobada per a generacions de barcelonins que valoren la qualitat i l'autenticitat dels seus productes, i jo això no m'ho vull perdre! Avui en dia, Perelló 1898 continua sent un referent en el món de la gastronomia local, mantenint viu l'esperit de la tradició familiar.\nAperitius amb una qualitat gurmet\nA Perelló 1898 es ven una selecció molt cuidada de productes del mar i aperitiu gurmet, amb un gran protagonisme del bacallà i les conserves artesanes. És una destinació mítica per als amants del vermut, les anxoves i els sabors intensos però delicats. Quan ens plantem davant la parada ens espera el David Perelló, que és la quarta generació al capdavant del negoci, i ens explica que els seus besavis van obrir la primera parada a la cantonada de Villarroel amb Mallorca. Allà, l'Enriqueta i l'Emili venien salaons, conserves i adobats quan no hi havia neveres i anys després van anar al Mercat del Ninot.\nD'aquella parada, recorda el David, en queden les tècniques de conservació que es continuen aplicant 118 anys després, i per tal que no es perdin i es continuïn fent servir molts anys més, van decidir crear la barra de degustació, que és on seurem d'aquí una estoneta.\nAbans de menjar, cal comprar\nEls treballadors de Perelló 1898 fan la compra diària al mercat per assegurar-se de la frescor dels ingredients, que posteriorment utilitzen per elaborar plats com gildes, brandada i bacallà a la llauna, amanides... Aquest procés reflecteix el compromís de la família amb la qualitat i la passió per la cuina tradicional. Així que abans de començar a menjar anirem a comprar amb la Jenny que ja la coneixen a totes les parades. Parada a Fruites i Verdures Rovira a buscar tomàquets, pebrots i cebes i també a Ous de Calaf, a buscar els ous més preciosos que mai he vist (per cert, la varietat d'ous d'aquesta bonica parada us deixarà perplexes).\nAra que ho tenim tot, ja podem anar a seure a la barra de Perelló 1898 i a esperar que en Gabriel, el xef, ens prepari alguna de les seves especialitats combinant els productes de la seva parada amb els que hem anat a comprar. Comencem amb unes gildes de bacallà d'Islàndia dessalat al seu obrador amb piparra, tomàquet confitat i olives de kalamata, i uns seitons casolans amb una mica de ratlladura de llimona i taronja. No em negareu que són dos aperitius de categoria.\nD'aquells ous meravellosos de Calaf, el Gabriel en fa una truita oberta amb ceba i tomàquet confitats, bacallà i pebrots del Padrón. La dolçor de la ceba i el tomàquet combinen a la perfecció amb l’intens umami del bacallà i el toc atrevit dels pebrots del Padrón; un plat amb capes de sabor de 10. Prosseguim amb uns porros amb unes làmines de tonyina, tomàquet en escabetx i una salsa tzatziki, que és una salsa grega refrescant i cremosa que es fa amb iogurt, all, oli d'oliva i cogombre (tot i que la del Gabriel és especial perquè porta cogombret envinagrat en lloc de cogombre ratllat).\nQuin tros de bacallà!\nEl plat fort, evidentment, és un llom de bacallà espectacular, d'aquests que quan trenques amb la forquilla es formen uns lloms grossos i carnosos. Per respectar el producte al màxim, es fa a la planxa i se serveix amb pebrot confitat i ceba, tal com li va ensenyar la seva mare. Per què és tant bo aquest plat tant senzill? Doncs perquè el producte de Perelló 1898 és de qualitat i alta gamma, i el pebrot i la ceba s'han comprat a la parada del davant; aquesta és la màgia dels mercats!\nLa raó és que Perelló 1898 no és només un lloc per comprar, sinó una experiència que connecta els visitants amb la història i la cultura culinària de Barcelona. La seva presència al Mercat del Ninot és un reflex de la vitalitat i la diversitat gastronòmica de la ciutat, on la tradició i la innovació coexisteixen per oferir una experiència única als amants del bon menjar. I una última cosa gourmeters, si després de conèixer el Perelló 1898, teniu ganes de descobrir la història del Mercat del Ninot, no us perdeu el vídeo i el reportatge del Barcelona Exprés del Jordi Palmer; el trobareu a la portada i a l'Instagram d'El Nacional!

This decision follows a Supreme Court order allowing ⁢for teh⁣ relaxation⁤ of stringent air pollution control measures‌ in⁤ the ⁢city.\nThe Supreme Court directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) too ​implement⁣ the less restrictive “Stage 2” of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) after Delhi ‘s air quality ‌improved ​to⁤ the “moderate” category. The court emphasized that⁤ it will continue to closely ‌monitor the situation and ​will⁢ reinstate⁤ stricter measures, such as “Stage 3” or “Stage ​4,” if the Air Quality Index (AQI) breaches 350 or ⁣400, respectively.\nThe Central pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported that Delhi’s air quality improved to ‘moderate’ category on ‍Thursday.​ (ANI) The Directorate of Education (DoE) issued a circular stating that all government,government-aided,and⁤ private schools‍ in ‍Delhi are to resume physical classes⁢ with immediate effect. The circular, which had previously mandated online classes due to severe air pollution, has been revoked.\n“All classes in all schools are to be held in physical mode with immediate effect,” the DoE circular read.

Though, due to the persistently poor air quality, classes for ⁢these grades were also moved online the following day.\nunder the stricter “Stage 4” of GRAP, several restrictions‌ were in ‍place, including limitations on diesel-powered vehicles and a mandate ⁣for offices to operate at 50% capacity with the remaining employees working from home.

    "text": "The New Orleans Pelicans have done poorly in every game that has been decided by three or fewer points.\nIn fact they are 0-6 in such games, which include each of their past three defeats.\nThursday night New Orleans hosts the Utah Jazz, who have five- and two-point victories against them on Nov. 25 and 27 in Salt Lake City.\n“It’s our free throws. It’s our execution. It’s our turnovers,” New Orleans coach Willie Green said after a 116-115 overtime loss at home against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. “It’s not one guy. It’s all of us. We have to learn from this. We’re in it together. We have to figure it out together.”\nThe Pelicans also have done poorly with double-digit leads. They led by as many as 15 points in the game and by 13 points at the end of the third quarter before losing to the Grizzlies. That came seven days after they lost a 24-point second-quarter lead in a 115-113 defeat, also at home, against the Grizzlies.\n“For 3 1/2 quarters, our game-plan discipline was at a high level,” Green said of the most recent loss. “We were executing. As the game started to get a little close, they upped their level of physicality and we started to turn the ball over and let them right back into the game.\n“This is where we have to grow,” Green added. “We have to learn to get to our spots, execute with force and pace, make solid passes. Then when we get to the free-throw line, make our free throws.”\nThe Jazz overcame a slow start in a 130-118 victory at San Antonio on Tuesday night. It was their third straight victory during a five-game road trip that concludes in New Orleans.\n“Winning on the road is tough in this league,” Utah coach Will Hardy said. “The trip has been pretty long, a little funky with Christmas in between, but I think the team is just really engaged right now.”\nIt’s also healthy after Keyonte George and Talen Horton-Tucker returned from injury against the Spurs, giving Hardy a healthy rotation for the first time since Nov. 22.\n“We are just getting back to our identity,” said forward Lauri Markkanen, who had 31 points and 12 rebounds against San Antonio. “We are moving with the ball and without the ball, playing unselfish basketball. … That’s really been key for us offensively.”\nThe Jazz have won six of eight overall. Jordan Clarkson scored 24 against the Spurs after scoring 30 three nights earlier against Toronto in his return from a six-game absence due to a thigh injury. He also had eight assists and six rebounds against San Antonio.\n“He’s been known as a scorer his whole career,” Hardy said of Clarkson. “I think the last year and a half, he’s made a really diligent effort to try to be a better playmaker and he’s done a great job.”\nUtah fell behind the Spurs 32-17 after the first 8:40 of action before turning things around with a 10-0 run to close the quarter. The Jazz then scored 103 points the rest of the way.\n– Field Level Media",
