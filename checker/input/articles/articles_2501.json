    "title": "MSI Claw: The Ultimate Gaming Handheld Console Review and Specifications - World Today News",
    "text": "It’s fun to put it in your bag and take it with you\nMSI launched its own gaming handheld console MSI Claw at this year’s 2024 CES. Starting with the Gabe Newell G, there has been a wave of gaming handheld console craze. PC gamers who want to advance at any time have more and more choices, and rising stars will also have the upper hand in the latest specifications. Just like MSI Claw is the world’s first e-sports handheld console equipped with Intel® Core™ Ultra processor! When you see Intel Ultra, you can expect AI to help. I like to test game handhelds the most, which means I have to play video games at work! We sort out the key issues of MSI Claw and introduce you to this new toy!\nQ1. What are the specification advantages? MSI Claw has been on the market for a while, and based on the feedback of early bird players, most of the players who own MSI Claw are attracted by the Intel® Core™ Ultra processor performance, Windows system multi-tasking, and 53Whr large-capacity battery. Battery life, as the world’s first gaming handheld equipped with Intel® Core™ Ultra processor, it still has great advantages\nThe version I actually tested is a Core™ Ultra 7 processor. Ultra means it has local NPU assistance and runs on Windows system, so what you buy is a PC computer, just smaller in size. Windows can do things and play games. For games, MSI Claw will do, but of course there will be situations that Windows will encounter. PC people all know this, so if you are buying a Windows game console for the first time, don’t rely on the stability of the game console. Yes, this situation is encountered by all brands of game consoles running Windows systems, but I am still excited to see Copilot appear on the console!\nThe Core™ Ultra processor also has the advantage of saving power. In addition, the battery capacity of MSI Claw is the largest among all handheld machines on the market. It is the largest 53Whr battery, giving it a gaming life of nearly two hours, which is about 30 hours longer than other models. Minutes, don’t snicker, for this small electric monster gaming handheld, 10 more minutes is an improvement! (Comfort engineer\nHow does it feel? Let me start by saying that I have tried all the e-sports handheld consoles sold in Taiwan on the market, so I guess. Except for the G Fat one, my fingers really can’t grasp it. The buttons are a bit too far, too heavy and too big. The other models are smaller than mine. The Dwarf Mini adapts well to the hand, thanks to the ergonomic efforts, especially the MSI Claw. It feels just right light when held. When I looked at the specifications, I found it was heavier than expected (675 grams). It should be because the counterweight is well done. I don’t know how. If you have the urge to play on your lap or on the table, you can simply play there for an hour without changing your position.\nThe casing only comes in one black color. To be fair, at first glance you will feel that it is very low-key, like a good student in a game handheld device. However, the RGB lighting effects and ABXY buttons that should be embellished are also made to be shiny and translucent.\nWhen playing, there is a Lucky dragon badge on the back, and the heat dissipation holes are also designed with a looming bright red dragon. Okay, that’s it!\nThe lower profile of the body will make the screen effect more prominent\nMSI Claw uses a 7-inch FHD (resolution 1920×1080) IPS screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 100% sRGB color space. Of course, it is a touch screen, which is very clear and beautiful when playing indoors!\nYou can still play games under the bright sun with the brightness set to the highest setting, but who goes out to play games under the bright sun?Okay, there may be a slight chance, so please be careful and give it to you for reference.\nAll the buttons that other e-sports handheld consoles should have are arranged in a regular manner, and they are all in convenient positions.\nMSI said that the triggers and joysticks are very sensitive through Hall effect sensors. When I played it, I did feel that the control of the movements was very fine. The presses were soft and the feedback was fast. When playing “Forza Horizon 5”, I controlled the throttle or “Little Nightmares 2” has a very low action error tolerance and can be controlled delicately.\nThere are also M1 and M2 back keys on the back.\nThe bottom is very clean and has no holes, so you can rest assured\nThe holes and fingerprint recognition power button are concentrated on the top. There is Thunderbolt 4 that supports PD fast charging, which is great. There are also indicator lights, a memory card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a volume button. TRUE GAMING is written in the middle.\nThere are two speakers at the bottom of the front. When I play with them, I think the sound could be more three-dimensional. Players who are used to using headphones will not be affected.\nIs there a built-in game control center? have!I really like the function buttons designed by MSI Claw. The interface is very simple and easy to understand. I can make it more beautiful next time hahaha. There are four buttons in total including menu, view, quick settings, and the most important MSI Center M button.\nThat’s right, just like the built-in control center of e-sports laptops, MSI Center M not only centralizes games but also game platforms, including Steam, Ubisoft, XBOX, Epic Games, EA, Battle.Net and MSI App. There has been an update during the period of use, and the interface has become more beautiful!\nHow does it perform in gaming? In addition to Core™ Ultra processors, MSI Claw also has Arc™ graphics cards!Intel has finally integrated the processor and graphics card, and communication with my family has been smoother. Intel has also worked hard to develop XeSS super sampling, which uses AI to make the game screen smoother. Currently, there are nearly 90 games that support XeSS. If you want to see the list Intel has it here including many popular works such as “Cyberpunk 2077”, “Diablo® IV”, “Dying Light 2”, “HITMAN 3”, “Mortal Kombat 1”, etc.\nContinue reading the story\nWhen I first started playing, I didn’t specifically turn on XeSS super sampling. I just ran with the default settings. When I ran the built-in performance test of “Forza Horizon 5”, I directly applied the recommendations. The FPS limit could be maintained between 45-55. If it drops slightly, For example, if the image quality is 1600×900, the screen will be smoother when running, probably between 55-65. Although the controls of “Little Nightmares 2” are simple, the graphics are actually very beautiful. The FPS can often run at the beginning of 100. I have a lot of fun playing it. I feel Very smooth!The efficiency is also at full level\nAs for whether to turn on XeSS super sampling, I think it depends on the game. After all, it is still being optimized. If the game you usually play turns on XeSS super sampling and adjusts other parameters to get closer to the picture you like, that would be great. !\nAs for the heat dissipation, it’s very impressive!It doesn’t get very hot. It uses Cooler Boost Hyper Flow, MSI’s own in-flow cooling technology. Hot air will not blow when playing games. The parts touched by your hands will not exceed 40 degrees while charging and playing games, maintaining a warm temperature. The state makes me think that the performance is not running out, but the usage context has indeed selected “Performance”, so the MSI Claw does a good job in heat dissipation. The physical design has large and numerous heat dissipation holes, and the temperature control is very good. good\nIn terms of battery life, taking “Gotham Knights” as an example, it can be played for 113 minutes. The brightness and volume are maintained at 50%. I usually play MSI Claw before going to bed. After finishing the game on the console in the living room, I go back to the room and continue using the palm. When playing other games on the phone, I usually play for about an hour before falling asleep, and the battery is still about 40-50%. I take it to the company to charge the next day, and then play another round while at work, and charge it fully before leaving work.\nIn terms of charging, MSI Claw comes with a transformer. Charging with the official transformer starts at 3% (the host will automatically shut down at around 3%-6%). Charging can reach 23% in 15 minutes, which is good!Charging will reach 81% in 60 minutes, and it takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to fully charge\nThe key specifications of MSI Claw are here:\nProcessorIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 processor 155H\nOperating systemWindows 11 Home\nTouch screen 7-inch FHD (120Hz update rate)\nGraphics Card Intel® Arc™\nMemory 16GB (LPDDR5-6400)\nStorage space 1TB NVMe SSD PCIe Gen4\nBattery capacity 53 Whrs\nWeight 675 grams\nTo sum up, MSI Claw is very suitable for players who want a Windows-based e-sports handheld device and want to seize the time to advance their games while commuting or going out. The advantage of using a Windows system is that it can be used as a small computer directly with an external screen and has Thunderbolt 4 connection. Port is enough to do it. It feels very comfortable to hold and play. The battery capacity and game endurance are also the longest in its class. It can be played for nearly 2 hours. If you haven’t tried it in person, I highly recommend you to try it on the MSI counter. Taiwan is the world’s first e-sports handheld console equipped with Intel® Core™ Ultra processor!

    "text": "Musk has all your data now, but its not just him. Starting Nov 15, third-party AI can use your public posts for training. Your data is being used to train Musk’s AI. By keeping your account on X, Musk has all of your data to train his AI, including any potential future commercial product based on Grok. Musk reportedly changed the algorithm after a football game because Biden got more retweets. He also changed the terms of service to reduce protections for transpeople and to label language used by gender minorities as ‘offensive slurs’. A post with the term ‘cis’ will provide a warning and de-boost the user posting it. Musk is also changing the terms of service in other ways, with several reported changes happening this week. Do you want to leave a unused account on a site that is changing its terms of services in ways you may not be aware of? X is quasi-state media now. Musk has been tapped to lead a government effort to drastically reshape the US government, and he has already created an account on X for that office before the administration is even in power. His own account, which he reportedly changed the algorithm to boost, regularly pushes content related to his new role. Much of his content is often overtly political these days in favor of MAGA, and he has been condemned for the spread of misinformation on X and from his own account. But those are not the only priorities of the incoming administration that Musk shares. Musk also agrees with the anti-trans platform that the GOP spent $215 million campaigning on. And he uses X to push his transphobic views. When Musk took over Twitter, he re-platformed previously banned right-wing accounts, many of which resumed posting bigotry that got them banned. Libs of TikTok (LoTT), an account that targets LGBT people, was the subject of a front page report by USA Today; the article’s focus was the threats that occurred after LoTT would post about places. Musk frequently interacts with LoTT and its creator, Chaya Raichik. After Raichik posted about making the front page of USA Today in this article, Musk congratulated her. In another instance, Musk briefly reinstated the ToS that prohibited deadnaming and misgendering of transpeople (he later said this was limited to Brazil). Raichik created a post where she deliberately misgendered several well-known transpeople, then gave her other accounts “if she got banned”. Musk responded personally saying that “you’re not going to get suspended.” LoTT is increasingly targeting LGBT people in general, including those working in schools or those who spoke out against MAGA. In addition, bigoted accusations that LGBT people are ‘groomers’ have proliferated on the platform since Musk bought it. Musk has previously stated a main goal is to defeat the “woke mind virus”, which is driven in a large part by his transphobia. It was a part of why he bought twitter, as he blamed the ‘woke mind virus’ for his daughter’s transition. Musk continues comment and post approving responses to transphobic posts from users, including commenting on many posts from LoTT. In another instance where the terms of use are not applied equally, talk show host Michael Knowles posted on X that “transgenderism” needed to be “eradicated” from “public life”; a message that the transgender population widely sees as a euphemism or coded term for genocide. After the attack in Israel, Musk announced he would be removing the accounts of anyone who called for genocide. I reported Knowles’ post through X’s reporting system, but it was never removed. I have posted to Musk and Linda Yaccarino dozens of times asking if Musk is still banning euphemisms for genocide, and if so, why Knowles’ post still remains. Neither have responded, and Knowles’ post is still up. Many of the paid “verified” accounts are right-wingers attracted by Musk’s “free speech” claims. Others users, distrustful of Musk, refused to give him money or their personal ID information to get verified and thus do not get the same ‘boost’ as verified accounts do. Therefore if you are unwilling to hand Musk your money, your account is already operating at a disadvantage, even before any potential algorithmic deboosting. Smaller, non-paid accounts already get hidden behind “additional spam or offensive posts” disclaimers in replies to posts. Many users also report seeing mostly right-wing accounts in their ‘for you’ tab of X. As you interact with right-wing accounts, you see the ads on their feeds. For verified accounts, they have the possibility of being paid a portion of the ad income through X’s revenue sharing program. As you interact with right-wing users and gain them views, they get paid for your interactions. X is an increasingly toxic platform, particularly for LGBT minorities. The owner of the site is driven in part by his transphobia, so the platform’s toxicity doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. Musk is reportedly willing to change the algorithms and the terms of use to align with his personal views. For the reasons above, you should delete your account, not just deactivate it. The old twitter isn’t coming back any time soon, if ever.",

Around 14,700 students from 800 schools and colleges across five blocks of the district took part in the event.\nSuperintendent of Police (SP) Vikrant Bhushan highlighted the importance of early education, stating that lessons learned in childhood were remembered for life. “Good education in childhood helps shape responsible citizens. It is the golden period for learning and teaching,” he said.\nBhushan credited the local Education Department for its significant contribution to the success of the quiz. He encouraged students to follow traffic rules willingly, not out of fear of the police. “By adhering to traffic rules, children can play an important role in strengthening the traffic system,” he added.\nHe announced plans for a district-level quiz competition on traffic rules, where top performers would be honoured. Bhushan also urged the students to not only follow traffic rules themselves but also inspire others to do the same, contributing to a safer and more efficient traffic system.\nThe district police are actively conducting seminars and workshops to spread awareness about traffic rules among the general public, which has yielded positive results.",
