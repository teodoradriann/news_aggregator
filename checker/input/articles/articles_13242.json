No hay necesidad de distracciones“, escribió la marca junto a las fotos de la campaña “Primavera 2024”.\n“No puedo vivir mi vida normalmente después de esto nunca más”, “ahora entiendo a la Rosalía”, “el motopapi”, “Rosalía, que la pases bien”, “¡Rosalía, madre mía, bájale!”, “ya veo por qué la Rosalía cambió al Rauw”, “ahora todo tiene sentido”, dicen algunos de los mensajes.\nAdemás de las candentes fotos, Jeremy protagoniza varios videos donde se quita la ropa para mostrar su abdomen y los famosos calzoncillos blancos, en la ciudad de Nueva York.\nDe acuerdo con CNN en Español, las fotos fueron tomadas por el fotógrafo Mert Alas.\nTras aparecer como imagen, el actor dio una entrevista a la revista GQ en donde aseguró que nunca pensó estar ahí.\n“Han hecho un trabajo maravilloso con estas campañas durante tanto tiempo. Siempre encuentran gente realmente interesante“, dijo antes de señalar que “no necesariamente vi esto en mi futuro. ¿Quién crece pensando: ‘Sí, estaré en una campaña de Calvin Klein?'”.\nSi bien, quitarse la ropa no es tan sencillo para algunos, Jeremy reconoció que ya se había preparado un poco, gracias a su papel en The Iron Claw.\n“Estaba acostumbrado a correr frente a grandes grupos de personas en ropa interior debido a The Iron Claw.

    "text": "• Soludo, Otu take judgment in good faith The Supreme Court judgment granting financial autonomy to local governments is a major victory for democracy, Senate President Godswill Akpabio, House of Representatives Speaker Tajudeen Abass, and Attorney-General of the Federation, Lateef Fabgemi(SAN), have said.\nWhile Akpabio and Abass congratulated President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for initiating the process that led to judgment, Fagbemi said it is an emancipation of the local governments.\nThey added that the judgment represents a significant milestone in the country’s democratic journey.\nThe trio spoke with reporters after meeting with President Tinubu, along with some senior government officials in Abuja.\nAkpabio said: “Recall that the request was placed before the courts by the AGF because the federal government, through President Bola Tinubu, feels strongly about separation of powers and the need for autonomy of all arms of governments, so for us in the legislature, the Supreme Court has spoken and we have no option than to abide by the Supreme Court judgment.’’\nThe Senate President called on the states ‘’to respect what the Supreme Court did ’’ while the National Assembly looks at how to ‘’dot the i’s and cross the t’s to ensure full implementation of the judgment. ‘’\nHe added: “This is a great day for democracy, and I congratulate the President for this initiative. I know that all Nigerians now know that local government administration is an arm of government meant for the grassroots and their money should be for the grassroots.\n’’ Definitely, local governments can now undertake projects on their own. So it’s a great day for democracy and is the beginning of great things to come.”\nAkpabio also praised the justices of the Supreme Court for the verdict and reiterated the parliament’s commitment to ensuring enforceability.\nHe said the issue of non-conduct of local government elections by some governors and called for elections that allow all political parties to participate.\n House of Representatives Speaker Abbas expressed delight of over the judgment.\n He described it as a historic moment, culminating from two years of efforts by the National Assembly to ensure local government independence through various constitutional amendments.\n Abass said the victory is a victory for the legislature and the nation, paving the way for functional local governments that can serve their people without interference from state governors.\n The Speaker expressed optimism that the judgment would enable local governments to extend goodwill to their constituents, unhindered by the excesses of state governors.\n‘’The House of Representatives welcomes this significant milestone in Nigeria’s democratic journey,’’ he added.\nFagbemi expressed delight at the decision, which he believes will empower local governments to develop their areas.\n He added that the judgment required states to conduct elections for local government areas, placing the onus on governors to comply.\n Fagbemi stressed that the judgment was clear on the consequences for non-compliance.\nDaniel congratulates Tinubu, Supreme Court Ogun State former Governor Gbenga Daniel said that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has demonstrated uncommon courage and leadership in a manner that seeks to return Nigeria on a trajectory of growth.\nDaniel, in his reaction to the judgment, said: “President Tinubu and the Supreme Court have restored sanity to the Nigerian political space as this will allow the dividends of democracy to reach the masses.’’\nThe former governor and Senator representing Ogun East in the Senate, added: “This constitutional resolution is long overdue because the local government administration is the closest to the grassroots and they should have the capacity to impact directly on the lives of the people through the initiation of life-changing programs and projects.\n“As a democrat, and a Progressive one at that, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has demonstrated enormous capacity in the struggle towards strengthening Nigeria’s democracy, and with this local government financial autonomy, he has once again set to recalibrate the wheels of our political and Economic growth in a way that it will make clear meanings to the average citizens.\n“I salute Mr. President for this global road map that will usher\nSoludo, Otu take judgment in good faith Anambra State Governor Charles Soludo said the Supreme Court judgment aligns with his administration’s commitment to democracy and the rule of law.\nSoludo, whose administration has yet to conduct council polls since 2021 when it came into office, said it was imperative for resources to reach the grassroots in a manner that promotes accountability and transparency.\nHe spoke with reporters after meeting with President Tinubu in Abuja yesterday.\n“The Supreme Court is supreme, it’s the final authority, and am a Democrat. I believe in the rule of law and once the Supreme Court has spoken, it has spoken.\n‘At a fundamental level, we need resources to get down to the real grassroots and we need the people’s money to work for them at all levels, whether at the federal or the state and the local government.\n“We need to promote accountability. We need to promote transparency in the utilisation of public resources at all levels, to be able to lift the burden off the common man.”\nRelated News Acknowledging that the Anambra State Government has not held local government elections, the governor reassured of his commitment to fulfilling his promise to conduct one soon.\n‘’When I was elected, that’s one of the things I promised our people because in Anambra, we haven’t had, to be honest with you, I think the first local government election we had was in 1998 or something thereabout, and then the next one was in 2014 or 2013. And that was it. I mean, finished one and a half years or two years thereabout, and even the institutions the place is quiet, not strengthened,’’ he said.\nSoludo’s counterpart in Cross River State, Bassey Otu also expressed approval of the ruling, stating that it has been received in good faith.\n He said: “Nigeria is a democratic country, and we know very well that President Tinubu and the renewed hope agenda is a democratic one. I believe that the judgment is taken in very good faith. All Nigerians should be happy about it.\n“I don’t think anybody is against development in the local governments. I have not read the details of the judgment as passed, but when we do, I believe that the application of it should add some pep to our local government administration.”\nAtiku: It’s victory for Nigerians Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has commended the Supreme Court’s verdict on financial autonomy for local governments.\nAtiku described it as a victory for Nigeria and a major corrective action in greasing the wheels of national development.’’\n “The judgment affirming fiscal autonomy to local government councils in the country is a win for the people of Nigeria,” he said in a statement on his X( formerly Twitter) account.\n The statement reads: “The court’s ruling is a step in the right direction and a major corrective action in greasing the wheels of national development across the country.\n‘’The decision by the Federal Government to consolidate disbursements of local councils’ revenues into the state government accounts was a decision that was borne out of politics of hasty compromise.\n‘’I align with the decision of the Supreme Court that the structure of the Nigerian government is portioned in three layers, and of these, the local governments should be centres of development.”\nBut Atiku, who was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate for last year’s general election, advised that the push for local government autonomy should not be limited to revenues.\nHe said: “I also share the belief that fiscal autonomy to the local governments should not be limited to revenues from the Federation Accounts, but indeed, should apply to Internally Generated Revenue from the respective local government authorities.\n“Many of our states, especially those in the ultra-urban areas with high-density economic activities, have become notorious for muscling local councils from generating revenue on items that border on motor parks, outdoor advertising, rents, and many more.\n‘’The verdict of the court is in tandem with the core functions of the Supreme Court as an arbitration court between and among governments.”\nVerdict negates true federalism, says Ibori Delta State former Governor James Ibori said that the verdict was an as assault on true federalism.\nAlthough Ibori said he was opposed to state governors fiddling with local government allocations, he argued that that does not ‘’call for this death knell(judgment) to the clear provisions of section 162(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n‘’The Supreme Court has dealt a severe setback on the principle of federalism as defined by Section 162(3) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n‘’The section expressly provides thus: “Any amount standing to the credit of the Federation Account shall be distributed among the Federal and State Governments and the Local Government Councils in each state on such terms and in such manner as may be prescribed by the National Assembly,” he wrote yesterday on his X (formerly Twitter) handle.\nThe former governor said Section 6 clarifies that ‘’each state shall maintain a special account to be called “State Joint Local Government Account” into which shall be paid all allocations to the Local Government Councils of the state from the Federation Account and from the government of the state.’’\nHe added that the apex court decision could be seen as an erosion of state autonomy.\n“The court’s ruling on the matter is an assault on true federalism. The federal government has no right to interfere with the administration of local governments in under any guise whatsoever. There are only two tiers of government in a federal system of government.\n“I’m opposed to fiddling with the allocations to the Joint LG Accounts at the state level but that in itself does not call for this death knell to the clear provisions of section 162 of the Constitution, ‘’ Ibori said.\nHe pointed out that the judgment ‘’appears to contradict the explicit provisions of Section 162 of the Constitution, shifts the balance of power between the federal government and states and may the financial independence of states and local governments.\nIbori added: “That local governments must be democratically elected goes without saying. Yes, I agree, that’s the position of the Constitution but withholding their allocation is not the way to go. It’s wrong.\n“In the coming days, we will begin to fully understand the implications of the Supreme Court decision. An assault on the Constitution is not the answer to fiddling with the Joint LG Account.\n‘’If the ruling is saying governors cannot temper, touch, fiddle with the joint accounts, that’s fine because they shouldn’t be doing that in the first place. But asking the Federal Government to pay local government allocations to the account of the Local Government directly is utter madness.\n“Like Justice Chukwudifu Oputa of blessed memory once said in describing the Supreme Court “We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.”\n“It is my sincere hope that the judgment delivered today(yesterday) will be reviewed at the earliest time possible because it stands the concept of federalism on its head.”",

On Sunday, following the storm that blanketed much of the Northeast in snow, the 25-year-old Canadian singer took to social media to share videos of himself frolicking in the winter wonderland. In one clip posted on X and Instagram, Mendes can be seen running outside wearing nothing but shorts and lying down in the snow. \"This is cold, bro,\" he says. In another video, he sleds down a small hill while shirtless and barefoot. \"you can take the boy outta Canada,\" Mendes joked in the caption. \"What my mum thinks i do before i get a flu,\" one fan commented on Instagram. \"I hope he doesn't get sick,\" someone else added on X. Eventually, Mendes warmed up by the fire, played some guitar, and went snowshoeing – with clothes on.

    "title": "Jordan Escalates Humanitarian Airdrops in Gaza, Collaborates with Global Allies Amid Israel Conflict",
    "text": "In an unprecedented surge of solidarity and support, the Jordanian Armed Forces have intensified their humanitarian airdrops into the Gaza Strip , marking a significant escalation in their efforts to provide relief amidst the ongoing conflict with Israel. This initiative, which has seen a notable increase in the number of airdrops to 37 from Jordan alone and 40 in collaboration with international partners, underscores the Kingdom's commitment to alleviating the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza since the conflict's onset on October 7 last year.\nAdvertisment Unwavering Support Amidst Crisis Since November 6, Jordan has spearheaded a critical mission to deliver essential supplies, including medical relief and food aid, to the residents of Gaza who are facing acute shortages due to the Israeli blockade. In a remarkable display of international solidarity, the United States, France, Egypt, and Belgium have joined forces with Jordan, collectively conducting 10 airdrops of humanitarian relief into northern Gaza . The initiative reflects a deep-seated spirit of cooperation and solidarity between Jordan and the embattled Gaza Strip, aiming to bolster the resilience of its people against the hardships imposed by the ongoing conflict.\nChallenges and Controversies Advertisment Despite the noble intentions and significant efforts to provide aid, the execution of airdrops has not been without its challenges. Aid agencies have pointed out several drawbacks associated with this method of delivery, including higher costs and limited capacity to reach all in need compared to traditional land deliveries. Moreover, a recent mishap involving a parachute malfunction during an airdrop reportedly resulted in casualties, including five deaths and ten injuries, sparking controversy and denials of involvement from both Jordanian and U.S. forces. This incident has raised questions about the efficacy and safety of airdrops as a method of delivering humanitarian aid in conflict zones.\nContinued Commitment to Humanitarian Relief Despite these challenges, Jordan's resolve to support the people of Gaza remains unwavering. The Kingdom has affirmed its commitment to continue these airdrops, working closely with its international partners to refine and improve the delivery mechanisms. This endeavor not only illustrates the complexities of providing humanitarian aid in conflict areas but also highlights the importance of international collaboration and solidarity in addressing the dire needs of affected populations.\nAdvertisment As the conflict in Gaza persists, the actions of Jordan and its allies serve as a beacon of hope for those caught in the crossfire. While the road to peace remains fraught with challenges, the continued humanitarian efforts underscore a collective determination to alleviate suffering and support the enduring spirit of the people of Gaza.",

    "title": "印度恢复发放中国公民旅游签证 中印关系重回正轨还需多久？ _ 东方财富网",
    "text": "7月23日，印度驻华大使馆宣布，自 2025年7月24日起，中国公民可申请旅游签证到访印度。这是印度自2020年限制中国公民的赴印签证后，首次恢复对中国公民的此类签证。\n　　这是印度在改善两国关系上迈出的“艰难”的一小步。对彼此显然都有益的这一举措，印方居然还是用了近十个月才迈出一步。2024年10月，中印两国领导人在喀山金砖峰会期间会晤，双方就达成了重回稳定发展轨道的共识。随后，双方工作层都努力借中印建交75周年的时机将中印关系带回正轨，为此展开了密集沟通和磋商。\n　　今年6月，中国方面恢复了印度香客赴中国西藏自治区“圣山圣湖”（冈仁波齐峰、玛旁雍错湖）的朝圣，首先释放了对印的善意和诚意。随之，印度方面也相向而行，印度国防部长、外交部长相继参加上合组织的活动并访华。\n　　由于印度自2020年后事实上奉行了与美结盟来共同反华遏华的战略，导致中印关系如今要正常化，就必须直面并解决一系列“问题清单”。这其实更是对印度政府改善对华关系的决心和能力的重大考验。\n　　过去五年，印度亲美势力的舆论引导，加上印度政府的反华举措，已经严重束缚莫迪政府改善中印关系。只需看看印度外交的“骚操作”，就能明白莫迪政府改善中印关系的意愿和能力。比如，这次宣布恢复中国公民旅游签证是通过印度驻华大使馆，而不是新德里的印度外交部。7月15日上午，国家主席习近平在北京人民大会堂集体会见来华出席上海合作组织成员国外长理事会会议的各国外 长和 常设机构负责人。但是，印度方面给这次会见配上的标题是“外交部长在北京拜会了中华人民共和国主席”，给人的感觉是中国国家主席单独会见了印度外长。\n　　显然，新德里对华改善关系，多半还是有点“被迫”意味的。特朗普再次执政以来，印美关系的“跌宕起伏”直接影响了印度对华政策的信心和底气。2024年特朗普当选后，印度外长苏杰生称，“特朗普重返白宫，很多国家都很担心焦虑，但是印度并不是‘紧张’的国家之一”。然而，2025年2月印度总理莫迪访美后感受到特朗普不念旧情，开始质疑以一味“亲美”为主轴的外交路线是否奏效。3月中旬，莫迪在接受美国播客主持人莱克斯·弗里德曼（Lex Fridman）采访时强调中印之间深厚的历史渊源，强调中印要通过对话消除分歧的必要性。\n　　然而，4月2日当美国宣布对全世界的贸易伙伴征收“对等关税”后，莫迪政府内阁中亲美势力又看到“机遇”。印度商工部长戈亚尔和外长苏杰生都认为，在美国关税引发的全球动荡中，印度看到了一个“千载难逢的机会”，甚至还扬言“不欢迎来自中国的投资”，要“放宽针对中国商品的质量控制令”等等。\n　　只是，形势比人强。中国通过对美国关税的强力反击后，中美很快达成协议，朝着逐步缓和协调的轨道发展。相反，印度在5月7日与巴基斯坦的空战中国际声誉大跌。特朗普政府也明显地奉行了重巴轻印的政策。更加上过去数年印度一味“亲美”导致外交失去了战略平衡，严重损害了与俄罗斯、中国的关系。在此背景下，由印度外长苏杰生主导的亲美为主轴的外交受到了越来越多的质疑和批评。\n　　这次对中国公民赴印旅游签证的放松，只是印度试图调整大国外交的一种表现。印度对华关系改善的程度和意愿，很大程度上还取决于印度政府对于印美关系和中印关系的认识。正如7月14日王毅外长同印度外长苏杰生会谈中所说，中印关系有自身历史逻辑和内生动力，不针对第三方，也不应受第三方干扰。如果印度能够有这样的认识，中印关系的持续改善是可以期待的。\n　　对于印度就中印关系改善迈出的这一小步，我们仍要积极予以肯定。然而，我们也要有耐性，“等得起”印度继续采取改善中印关系的举措，因为这些措施本质上都是对双方有利的选择，而不是印度战略家们认为的、是可以“拿捏”我们的杠杆。\n　　（林民旺，复旦大学国际问题研究院教授、副院长）\n（文章来源：澎湃新闻）",
