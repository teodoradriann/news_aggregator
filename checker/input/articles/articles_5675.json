    "title": "Mark Cuban Backs TikTok Rival That Uses BlueSky Technology: How Skylight Is Changing The Game - Benzinga",
    "text": "Zinger Key Points A new TikTok rival is built with the same technology that powers decentralized social media platform Bluesky. Mark Cuban invested in a pre-seed round for the app.\nThe ‘Trade of the Day’ is now live. Get a high-probability setup with clear entry and exit points right here. Entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban is one of several backers of a pre-seed round of Skylight , a startup seeking to rival TikTok , an app that could have new owners in the U.S. soon.\nWhat Happened: Skylight uses the AT Protocol, the same technology that helps social network Bluesky , which is one of Cuban's favorites.\nThe startup released its mobile app publicly Tuesday after 10 weeks of development, as reported by TechCrunch .\nThe short-form video app was developed by co-founder Tori White and Reed Harmeyer. The duo said Skylight features in-app video editing tools, public comments and likes along with the ability to set up user profiles and follow other users.\nSince the app is built on the AT Protocol, Skylight can also be seen and engaged with by the more than 33 million existing Bluesky users.\nCuban funded a pre-seed round for Skylight. Graham & Walker Venture Fund was also an investor in the round.\nRead Also: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama Join Bluesky, Posts Take Aim At Elon Musk’s Efforts In Wisconsin: Here Are The Top 10 Most Followed Accounts\nWhy It's Important: White and Hermeyer said they were inspired to create Skylight when news of TikTok being banned in the U.S. broke.\nWhile the potential TikTok ban is on pause as a buyer is shopped for, Skylight could be set to benefit from being ban-proof by using the underlying Bluesky technology, for the decentralized social media network.\nWhite was a travel influencer worried about losing all of her past TikTok videos, which she has backed up. While she may have the videos, she fears that she could lose the comments and access to her community following she built.\nSkylight supports video uploads like TikTok, but also wants to make sure users can customize their feed in the future, giving creators more control. This could include sounds, duets, stitching, bookmarks, playlists and more, according to the report.\nCuban previously said he was interested in backing apps similar to TikTok and are created with Bluesky in mind.\nThe Skylight app is available in the Google Play Store and Apple’s iOS store.\nRead Next :\n‘Shark Tank’ Poll Reveals Most Polarizing Star — Is It Mark Cuban?

    "text": "KERRVILLE, Texas – All of the stuff that was inside Wayne Donaghe’s home is now in a pile of what used to be his driveway.\nSeveral feet behind the pile is where Donaghe’s 87-year-old wife, Caroline, nearly drowned after she fell and broke her shoulder as they escaped the floodwaters on July 4.\nCaroline survived and just got out of surgery. She is currently recovering at a rehabilitation facility in Boerne.\nDonaghe knows they are fortunate to be alive after his home, which he said is 30 feet above the Guadalupe River, was submerged by the flood.\n“It’s heavy,” Donaghe said. “Everything about this is heavy. Everything.”\nDonaghe said the home has been in his wife’s family for the past 100 years. He had just finished remodeling it over the past five years.\nWaist-deep floodwaters rushed into the home as Donaghe, Caroline, his stepson and their dog barely made it out alive.\n“We survived by a hair,” Donaghe said. “But we are alive.”\nDonaghe said he is now doing everything he can to save the beloved home. He was the first in line on Thursday when the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened its doors to flood survivors.\n“I dropped everything I had into this house money-wise, so I have no insurance,” Donaghe said. “This is going to take a while. It’s been in the family. It’s my responsibility to keep it there. God, I can’t explain why it happened. Everybody was praying for rain. And we got it.”\nDonaghe said he is thankful for the people who have stepped up to help. Like the 100 people from the Kerrville Church of Christ who helped gut what is left of his home to see if it’s salvageable once it dries out.\n“God is putting people in front of me as I need them, so he is working,” Donaghe said.\nDonaghe said he still has a lot on his plate.\nHe will be going back and forth from his home to the bed and breakfast that was donated to him and his wife in Lukenbach, which is approximately 45 miles away.\nDonaghe is also on the phone, talking with FEMA to help obtain some assistance.\n“My first priority is my wife, my family and then we are here,” he said.\nDonaghe said he is very grateful to everyone who has helped out, and that the best way to help not just him but all survivors is through things like gift cards.\nRight now, he said, most people who have lost everything don’t have places to store the donated items.\nMore related coverage of this story on KSAT:",

Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia.

No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
