    "title": "Wall Street: record after record, Tesla and Intel disappoint -January 25, 2024 at 05:08 pm | MarketScreener",
    "text": "And that's 5!\nWall Street continues to set new records, with the S&P500 (+0.53%) achieving a petit slam: 6th affiliated gain and a 5th record close... but no new intraday zenith.\nThe Dow Jones rallied +0.3% in the wake of IBM (+9.5%) and Walgreen (+3.3%), a rise held back by Boeing (-5.7%).\nSmall slam also for the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2% to 15,510), which also posted a 6th rise and an all-time closing record. As for the Nasdaq-100, the initial 0.6% gain was largely wiped out by Tesla (-12.2%), which fell back to its lowest level since May 2023, and also plummeted in the ranking of the world's largest capitalizations, and could even leave the top-ten (Tesla suddenly fell behind Eli Lilly and Broadcom (despite a decline of nearly -2%).\nElon Musk has warned that sales growth will slow this year despite price cuts that are squeezing margins.\nDan Ives, the star analyst at Wedbush Securities, nicknamed the 'pope of technos', lowered his target from $350 to $315 and expressed his dismay: \"We were treated to a long explanation of the text on Tesla's long-term vision and a conference call that sounded like complete nonsense\".\nPaypal also gave up -3.6% after the publication of its results, and in the after-hours, Intel was a big disappointment, dropping -7.7%: the chipmaker reported sales of between $12.2 and $13.2 billion, compared with an expected $14.50 billion.\nWorse still, Intel forecasts first-quarter earnings of just 13 cents per share, excluding non-recurring items, whereas analysts were expecting 33 cents per share (this will improve in subsequent quarters).\nVisa also saw its quarterly results come in at a disappointing -2.8%... household spending is not supporting the group's business that much.\nThe S&P500 and Nasdaq were supported - for once - not only by the SOXX (semiconductor ETF down -0.3% this evening), but also by the oil sector (+2.5% on average among the majors), followed by United Rentals +13%, American Airlines +10.3%, Comcast +3.4%, Netflix +3.1% and Alphabet +2.2%.\nWithin the SOXX, performances were mixed: Western Digital climbed +4%, Cisco +2%, AMD +1.1%... but tomorrow, Intel's fall is likely to weigh heavily.\nAfter this heavy disappointment, followed by that of ST-Micro, ASML's cautious forecasts for Q1 2024.... it's hard to understand to what extent A.I. is helping to boost the results of the leaders in 'high-performance' chips... but perhaps it's only benefiting producers of the 'top of the top' (5 to 7 micron components, handling millions of operations/second).\nAs for US figures, Wall Street was not disappointed (its 0.5% rise bears witness to this): GDP (gross domestic product) growth for the 4th quarter of 2023 came in +1.3% higher than expected, at +3.3% annualized, according to a very first estimate from the Commerce Department.\nGrowth in the world's leading economy eased from the roaring 4.9% seen in the third quarter, but should reach 2.5% in 2024, well above the 2% previously forecast.\nThe increase in the fourth quarter was mainly due to growth in consumer spending and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased', says the Commerce Department.\nSurprise, too, on the new single-family home sales front: they rebounded by 8% in December 2023 compared with the previous month, to an annualized rate of 664,000 units, according to the Commerce Department, following a 9% drop in November.\nThe median home price was $413,200, and the average price came in at $487,300. The inventory of new homes for sale stands at 453,000, representing a reserve of around 8.2 months at the current rate of sales.\nFinally, weekly jobless claims were up by 25,000: the Labor Department announced 214,000 new claimants, while the number of people receiving regular benefits also rose by 27,000 to 1.1 million.000 to 1.833Mn in the week from January 8 to January 13.\nSurprisingly, these very robust figures (notably GDP) are not worrying the US fixed-income markets, with the 2034 T-Bond erasing -5.5Pts to 4.123%, and the 2-year -7Ps to 4.308%.\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.

    "title": "Morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy. The FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels. “The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance. Even then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.” People are also reading… Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms. Aaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said. Many highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms. Parker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels. “They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said. According to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked. The North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported. Marian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.” Heather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi. Mushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died. Before the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.” The FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert. The study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication. The study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms. Hallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs. In the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said. There hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "text": "The massive national wave of devotion to Lord Ram witnessed recently during the consecration of the Mandir in Ayodhya, was breathtaking—and inspiring. Even though I grew up in a family steeped in Krishna bhakti, the reverence for Bhagwaan Ram was no less sacrosanct even in my milieu of Krishna bhakts. So, I could relate with the joy of the millions of genuine devotees, and their innocence, surrounding the Ram Mandir. What is of concern, however, is the noxious commingling of politics and religion. As someone who drinks deeply from the well of Santan Dharma—with a daily routine of over two hours of yoga, meditation, pranayama, and satsang of seers, sages, and scriptures—it pains me to see its flagrant weaponization by a political party. An unparalleled spiritual heritage of supreme knowledge is being reduced to an opportunistic performative religion, drummed up for vote-bank politics. The earnest faith of the many millions of Indians is being co-opted for naked consolidation of power, and a beautiful path to God-realization is being corrupted into a chauvinistic dagger cleaving through national unity. India has been blessed with the rarest of rare gifts: a body of spiritual knowledge handed down from the ancient rishis that dares to propose the possibility of a transcendental transformation of the mortal to the divine—and that this can be a living experience, not just an article of faith promising heaven in the afterlife. From the Bhagavad Gita to the Ashtavakra Gita, our sacred texts implore us to undertake a deeply personal spiritual journey of self-transformation—not the chest-thumping superficial performance of seemingly sacred acts. From luminaries like Patanjali and Adi Shankaracharya to the more recent self-realized masters like Ramana Maharishi and Swami Vivekananda, and countless other enlightened beings produced by this land—all have unanimously emphasized chipping away at the unreality of our human form to discover the divinity that is our true self. It is not that Hinduism does not allow for the kind of worship that was on display during the consecration of the Mandir. Communal rituals too have been a long and valued tradition in Hinduism. However, the Gita warns us against rituals and worship done in ignorance or for egoic ends—such as, for example, the large-scale religious passions orchestrated by a well-oiled political machinery. This is the kind of performative religion where the “devotees” are WhatsApp warriors flaunting their majoritarian muscle and solidifying lines of division. You are expected to either fall in step with them or be outcasted with ugly labels like sickular, Macaulian, antinational, and worse. True dharma, on the other hand, is one that would strengthen our conscience to call out censorship, bullying, hatemongering, lynching, and killings in the name of religion. But most find it hard, if not impossible, to stand up to a massive national mood. Why buck the trend, become the pariah, and even perhaps face brutal harassment and death threats? Why put yourself through all this agony when you can, instead, take refuge in the security and pride of the masses? But this jumping on the bandwagon will extract a price! The Hindus, giddy from the heady euphoria of majoritarian fervor, who are either okay, or worse—enthusiastic—about such politicization of their religion, may be fooling themselves if they think they’re the beneficiary in this profane hookup. Look around… theocracies haven’t fared well. Countries like Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, the ones practically ruled by Mullahs, are failed states. In contrast, millions are clamoring to come to the U.S., a country where separation of church and state has been enshrined in the Constitution. Countries that are seen as exemplary and are consistently ranked at the top of happiness markers, such as the Scandinavian nations, are the ones that are liberal, inclusive, and secular. Japan, another successful nation, values secularism despite being monocultural. Even an authoritarian regime like China knows the value of secularism. Right from ancient times, the ethos of Bharatvarsha has been deeply ingrained in eclecticism, coexistence, and diversity. Any attempt to thrust theocracy upon this massively diverse population of close to 1.5 billion is bound to end in disaster.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) [#2](c2#c-2) no se qué veis de incomprensible\nNo sólo se ha facilitado y propiciado durante siglos, sino que en los últimos años, aún se les ha dado más manga ancha.\nPor lo visto, con eso de que toda la gente le pide tanto a su dios continuamente, se debe de amortizar de algún modo.\nEn fin, magufadas, lo normal.. mientras formen parte del adn político-socio-cultural.\n[#2](c2#c-2) El PSOE de antes de la guerra civil participó en la Constitución española que incluyó el siguiente artículo:\nArtículo 26.\nTodas las confesiones religiosas serán consideradas como Asociaciones sometidas a una ley especial.\nEl Estado, las regiones, las provincias y los Municipios, no mantendrán, favorecerán, ni auxiliarán económicamente a las Iglesias, Asociaciones e Instituciones religiosas.\nUna ley especial regulará la total extinción, en un plazo máximo de dos años, del presupuesto del Clero.\nQuedan disueltas aquellas Órdenes religiosas que estatutariamente impongan, además de los tres votos canónicos, otro especial de obediencia a autoridad distinta de la legítima del Estado. Sus bienes serán nacionalizados y afectados a fines benéficos y docentes.\nLas demás Órdenes religiosas se someterán a una ley especial votada por estas Cortes Constituyentes y ajustada a las siguientes bases:\n1ª. Disolución de las que, por sus actividades, constituyan un peligro para la seguridad del Estado.\n2ª. Inscripción de las que deban subsistir, en un Registro especial dependientes del Ministerio de Justicia.\n3ª. Incapacidad de adquirir y conservar, por sí o por persona interpuesta, más bienes que los que, previa justificación, se destinen a su vivienda o al cumplimiento directo de sus fines privativos.\n4ª. Prohibición de ejercer la industria, el comercio o la enseñanza.\n5ª. Sumisión a todas las leyes tributarias del país.\n6ª. Obligación de rendir anualmente cuentas al Estado de la inversión de sus bienes en relación con los fines de la Asociación.\nLos bienes de las Órdenes religiosas podrán ser nacionalizados.\nhttps://www.congreso.es/constitucion/ficheros/historicas/cons_1931.pdf\nLuego en pleno franquismo, en 1974, se compró a base de talonario al PSOE en el congreso de Suresnes. Y desde entonces el PSOE \"actual\" pasó a ser pseudofranquista, dado que a pesar de haber tenido una mayoría absoluta en el 82, mantiene privilegios y protege con uñas y dientes a tooooooda la herencia del franquismo: ejército, judicatura, monarquía, FFCCSE, grandes fortunas nacidas del latrocinio franquista, iglesia, etc.. Ha tardado décadas en quitar parte (que no todos) de los monumentos que glorificaban a Franco y al franquismo.\nEspecialmente a la iglesia le aumentó el % que se llevan de la \"X\" de la renta, y le han dejado carta blanca para expandirse por servicios esenciales como educación, residencias, sanidad, etc, a la vez que se ha permitido el pago con dinero público para los negocios privados de la multinacional vaticana.\nPor un Concordato fullero prorrogado del franquismo se ha librado la iglesia de ser juzgada por todos los casos de abusos sexuales a menores que lleva perpetrando \"desde siempre\" y hasta nuestros días, y está exenta de pagar la mayoría de impuestos que sí pagamos el resto de los súbditos. ¡Con la excusa de que no tienen dinero! Luego te enteras de que a raíz de inmatricularse a su nombre la Mezquita de Córdoba por 30€ están sacando un beneficio EN NEGRO (sin tributar por ello) de hasta 18 millones de euros al año. Y tienen 99.999 propiedades más dedicadas a su dios verdadero: EL DINERO\n[#4](c4#c-4) Primero hay que derogar el Concordato y luego establecer un sistema de financiación como el alemán, cortando cualquier atisbo de dinero público para la secta y donde sean los fieles los que paguen y mantengan a la secta con un 8-9% de su dinero.\nDespués, si se ve que ya casi no hay adeptos a la secta, desamortización con la restauración del artículo 26 de la anterior Constitución española (ver\n[#33](c33#c-33)). Que dicho artículo se redactó así por algo, todos sus puntos tienen un sentido recogido de un porqué histórico, menudos problemas ha dado la iglesia en España desde siempre, conspirando, adoctrinando, abusando y trincando todo lo público que les ha venido en gana sin pagar por ello.\n[#51](c51#c-51) \"Las izquierdas deberían ser más respetuosas con las religiones y no tan autoritarias.\"\nLa realidad a lo largo de los tiempos ha sido y es otra bien distinta de la que tú dices. Dramatización:\n[#57](c57#c-57) No confundamos cristianismo y catolicismo. En España el problema es la iglesia como modelo económico extractivo, no la religión. Está claro que el catolicismo necesita todo el dinero del mundo, y se mueve exclusivamente para llegar a esa meta. Bastaría con poner en España un modelo de financiación como el Alemán para sustentar a la iglesia católica apostólica romana, y así saldríamos de dudas de cuantos católicos hay en España realmente.\n[#60](c60#c-60) \"La iglesia no es extractiva.\"\nLos hechos ACTUALES niegan categoricamente tal afirmación. Por algo están exentos hasta de los impuestos de sucesiones y donaciones, y precisamente tienen a funcionarios capellanes (pagados de nuestros impuestos) buitreando por las salas de críticos de los hospitales a ver qué pillan, O el inmenso patrimonio inmobiliario del que habla el meneo. O su escasísima participación económica en Cáritas frente a lo que trincan del estado por el mismo concepto. O los miles de millones anuales que mueven las escuelas de su propiedad. O los casi mil millones que mueven los libros de texto y su amplia presencia entre las editoriales mayoritarias. O sus inversiones en SICAVs mientras pasan el cepillo con ahínco.\nQue cuando tú tienes un problema te mandan a rezar, pero para \"resolver\" los suyos la iglesia no hace más que pedir dinero.\n[#64](c64#c-64) Claro que es una multinacional PRIVADA, y funciona como tal con su labor EXTRACTIVA. Sabrás que cada vez que la iglesia mete mano a uno de los suyos \"judicialmente\" es porque este ha tenido la mano larga con el dinero y no con los niños. En el último caso le mandan a una parroquia nueva, casi que un premio en forma de carne fresca, y encima estos delitos sexuales contra los menores se encubren por todo el estamento eclesiástico, llegando hasta el Papa y gracias a la protección del Concordato.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Estas sectas siempre están disponibles para entrar en los negocios de verdad: nadie mejor que ellos para legitimizar y glorificar golpes de estado y dictadores genocidas como los que han propiciado el expolio en España o la religión que alimenta con su irracionalidad la invasión de Palestina.\n[#32](c32#c-32) ya se hace, en la catedral de Pamplona podías organizar la comida de la boda, previo pago generoso\n[#55](c55#c-55) lo cierto es que no existen unas condiciones prefijadas a la hora de la contratación. El precio, como el resto de condiciones, se negocia con los interesados. Y aunque desde la Iglesia no facilitan una referencia, subrayan que \"no se trata de esquilmar a nadie con los precios, en absoluto\"\nImagino que dependerá de\"CUANTO\" opusiano seas, cuanto hayas contribuido ya a la obra y cuánta pasta tengas (cuanto más pasta tengas más te sablarán)\n[#11](c11#c-11) No se donde leí que la desamortización de Mendizabal fue quitarle tierras a la iglesia para repartírselas luego 4 señoritos ricos.\nAdenda (De la susodicha desamortización de Mendizabal en la wikipedia) :\nLos pequeños labradores no pudieron entrar en las pujas y las tierras fueron compradas por nobles y burgueses urbanos adinerados, de forma que no pudo crearse una verdadera burguesía o clase media en España que sacase al país de su marasmo.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Añádele que, según alguinos cálculos, suposu la deforestación de entre el cinco y el 7% de todo el país, una ruina para el partrimionio artístico y una ruina fatal para los aparceros que pasaron de estar en \"renta antigua\" a no poder vivir de sus tierras.\nUn desastre.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Fue entregar al \"mercado\", en este caso a rentistas muchas veces ausentes, las tierras comunales y las de la iglesia.\nLas de la iglesia, en general, tenían unos foros casi simbólicos que se gastaban localmente. Cuando pasaron a manos de la \"iniciatiava privada\", se multiplicaron por 5, 10, 20 veces para dar una rentabilidad similar a las de otros activos y se mandaban a la ciudad.\nA mi me hace bastante gracia, ( por decirlo suavemente) cada vez que paso por la calle Almagro de Madrid por la puerta de un conjunto de edificios de la Iglesia que abarcan toda una enorme manzana y que probablemente este en el podium de los terrenos más caros de todo Madrid. ¿sabeis como se llama la congregación que vive allí? Hermanitas de los pobres. Con dos ovarios.\n[#18](c18#c-18)\nNo me hagas reír.\nInmuebles para caridad ?\nPor eso no pagan IBI ,ni IVA y muy probablemente esas monjas cobraban en negro.\nDecía Saramago que la Iglesia solo ha servido para separar, quemar y torturar\nNunca para unir a la gente.\nLa Iglesia es el Gran Parásito de nuestra sociedad..\nY empezaron con un establo!\nHay que desamortizar todos los bienes cuyo uso no sea el de templo para oficios reliosos o monasterios.\nLas residencias de los curas, obispos y demás deben estar a su nombre y pagar los impuestos correspondientes como persona física.\n[#0](c0#c-0) Es curioso que en la entradilla del artículo (copiado a la de aquí) pongan equivocadamente \"100,000\" y que luego en el texto salga correctamente \"100.000\". Ya he visto este error en la entradilla de dos medios más, por ahora.\nLuego espero que los del medio de comunicación se den cuenta de un error garrafal: \"En cumplimiento de lo establecido en la Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos de Carácter Personal 15/1999 (...)\" (esta Ley es obsoleta, se cumple el RGPD de 2016).\n[#44](c44#c-44) Ya, eso lo hablamos por aquí no hace mucho con otros artículos. Hay que ir con ojo con esto, no estoy de acuerdo con las nuevas \"recomendaciones\". Tradicionalmente en España y en casi todos los países europeos (sino todos) se ha utilizado siempre el punto para los miles y la coma para los decimales.\nEl problema no es solo De la Iglesia, sino también de notarios y registradores que dan por buenas operaciones que a ninguno de nosotros nos aceptan. Y falta impulso de l Estado en la recuperación…",
