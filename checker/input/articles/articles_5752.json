Le passage de Bordeaux en appel devant la DNCG a abouti sur le redressement judiciaire du club et sa relégation en National.\nLe club a d'ailleurs revendiqué son envie d'évoluer en National 1 lors de la campagne à venir, via un communiqué officiel.\nBordeaux, la triste fin L'article continue ci-dessous \"Suite à la confirmation de la décision de la DNCG de reléguer le FC Girondins de Bordeaux en National 1, le Club a, ce mardi, déposé le bilan auprès du Tribunal de Commerce de Bordeaux, afin d’entamer la restructuration nécessaire. En conséquence, le Tribunal de Commerce prononcera, très prochainement, l’ouverture d’une procédure collective qui entraînera automatiquement la perte du statut professionnel du Club.\"\nLa note du club ajoute : \"Dès lors, au vu des délais très courts avant le début de la saison de National 1, le Club a dû renoncer à demander le maintien de son statut professionnel faute de quoi il aurait dû se présenter à nouveau devant la DNCG avec un budget ne correspondant pas à la réalité à venir du Club, ce qui aurait pu le conduire à des sanctions supplémentaires lourdes. C’est une décision difficile qui anticipe une conséquence inéluctable du processus de restructuration en cours. Si le centre de formation fermera en conséquence, le Club continuera à promouvoir des équipes de jeunes.\"\nProchain match: Jeux d'amitié des clubs SCO GBO Présentation du match\nPublicité",

    "text": "BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (WSBT) — Michigan's Attorney General released a report of alarming sexual misconduct allegations involving the Diocese of Kalamazoo. 19 priests across the 9 counties in Southwest Michigan are accused in the report including one former Benton Harbor Priest. This is the 3rd of 7 reports coming from the Attorney General's Office with these allegations dating all the way back to 1950. Jacob Vellian was born in 1934 and charged with 2 counts of rape in 2019 for an alleged assault that occurred in 1973. \"You were trusted to our care.. and we failed to protect you,\" said Bishop Edward Lohse - Diocese of Kalamazoo. That was from a news conference earlier Monday releasing information about the allegations of sexual misconduct across Southwest Michigan, including one case involving a former Benton Harbor priest.. Jacob Vellian. The AG's report outlines the series of events. In 1973 a 15-year-old JANE DOE was a volunteer at St. John the Evangelist parish in Benton Harbor. A month after she started Vallian allegedly began to compliment her and rub her neck and shoulders. That then transitioned into inappropriate touching, Vallian reportedly saying he was \"trying to fill her soul with the holy spirit,\" all before JANE DOE turned 16. In 1974, Vellian left the parish and the state of Michigan. Fast forward nearly 30 years later and JANE DOE reports the abuse to the Diocese of Kalamazoo. And then nearly 8 years later JANE DOE once again came forward, this time to a deacon of the church. In 2019, Vellian was charged with 2 counts of criminal sexual conduct and in 2023 while awaiting extradition Vellian likely died in India. St. John the Evangelist became Saints John and Bernard Parish in 1996 in Benton Harbor. Kalamazoo Bishop Lohse vowed to rewrite these past wrongs. \"I know how deeply the clergy's sexual abuse crisis has shaken your faith. Betrayal by the people we were taught to trust and respect has caused a deep wound in our communities,\" said Bishop Edward Lohse - Diocese of Kalamazoo. The full report listed by AG Nessel is 144 pages long. You can read the full report below: This push for justice dates back to 2018. Although Vellian is believed to be dead his charges of alleged rape would be a maximum life sentence in prison.",

    "text": "Football Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool Liverpool reste sur le trône de la Premier League après la contre-performance de son désormais dauphin, Arsenal, battu à l'Emirates Stadium par West Ham (2-0) jeudi en conclusion d’une 19e journée qui aura vu perdre trois des cinq équipes de tête. Cinq jours après avoir accroché les Reds à Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal a contre toute attente cédé face à l'équipe qui l'avait éliminée de la Coupe de la Ligue début novembre. Les Hammers ont donné raison à l'analyse de leur entraîneur David Moyes, qui assurait avant le match que cette année était la meilleure de l'histoire du club, avec notamment un triomphe en Ligue Europa Conférence. Ils n'ont pas concédé la moindre occasion dans la première demi-heure de jeu, et même marqué peu avant le quart d'heure après une mauvaise appréciation de Gabriel Magalhaes, qui a profité à Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13e). L'ancien défenseur Lillois a également perdu un duel aérien décisif en seconde période face à Konstantinos Mavropanos, suite à un corner de Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55e). Un manque de réalisme côté Gunners Souvent efficaces face au but depuis le début de la saison, les Gunners ont cette fois manqué de réalisme avec Saka (30e, 42e), Martinelli (37e), Gabriel Jesus (66e) puis Trossard dans le dernier quart d'heure. Le score aurait pu être plus cruel si Benrahma avait transformé son penalty dans le temps additionnel. Les rentrées en jeu successives de Nketiah, Nelson et Smith Rowe ont rappelé le manque de profondeur de banc à disposition de Mikel Arteta. Arsenal compte deux points de retard sur Liverpool, alors que West Ham, 6e, est à l'affut des places européennes, à trois points de Tottenham et quatre points de Manchester City, vainqueur mardi à Everton (3-1) et qui compte un match de plus à disputer. Tottenham rechute lourdement Peu avant, Tottenham avait sévèrement rechuté sur le terrain de Brighton (4-2) et raté l'occasion de se rapprocher de la tête du championnat. Tottenham était pourtant la meilleure équipe à l'extérieur avant cette rencontre et finit la première moitié de saison sur une note négative, malgré une bonne cinquième place au classement, à un point de Manchester City. Meilleurs ces dernières semaines après un mois de novembre catastrophique sur le plan des résultats, les Spurs ont montré un visage inhabituel avec beaucoup de passivité, comme sur cette action individuelle de Joao Pedro qui a pu passer en revue quatre joueurs et donner une balle en or à Jack Hinshelwood, démarqué à l'entrée de la surface de réparation (1-0, 11e). Entre plusieurs occasions nettes pour Brighton (17e, 32e, 45e), le même Joao Pedro allait ensuite transformer deux pénalties (23e, 75e), avec entre-temps une frappe puissante de Pervis Estupinan dans la lucarne opposée de Vicario (63e). Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e) ont réduit le score, trop tard pour faire douter les Seagulls. Brighton se repositionne à la huitième place, à six points de la première place européenne.",

    "text": "In the developing hemp market, THCa is becoming more and more well-liked, drawing in both new and repeat consumers. Raw and living cannabis plants contain a combination of compounds called tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). It is the non-psychoactive form of THC’s precursor. Go to https://www.drganja.com/diamond-distillate-14g to see the range of products made from Diamond distillate.\nLowers the number of other chemicals while producing a product that is almost pure THCa.\nThe potency, adaptability, and rising interest in hemp have made THCa diamond distillate more and more well-liked. In this blog, we’ll go over the unique qualities of THCa, the elaborate distillation process, and the reasons behind the current increase in demand for THCa diamond distillates.\nWhat is THCa?\nTHCa is an innate event cannabinoid seen in cannabis plants. Unlike the well-known THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), THCa is not psychoactive. Therefore, it won’t get you “high” like raw cannabis does. THCa and THC differ mainly from one another in terms of their molecular makeup and style of action.\nA part process known as decarboxylation takes place. THCa is converted to THC by this device. This is the first stage that starts THCa’s psychoactive effects.\nIn its raw form, delta-9-THCa has some possible fitness benefits, such as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective results. It is a vital part of the natural cannabis plant since it adds to the plant’s overall quality and acts as a sign of THC.\nThe process for Producing THCa Diamond Distillate\nTo create the pure, potent thing known as THCa distillate from raw cannabis, an exact process is followed.\nHere is a careful break of the steps difficult in making THCa distillate:\nDecarboxylation Winterization Distillation Extraction Temperature control is vital for the entire process, but especially for the decarboxylation and distillation phases.\nThe correct heat rule ensures that THCa is triggered without compromising the product’s quality, force, and purity.\nBecause of this careful concern in temperature, THCa distillate is very strong and pure. It is single on the market due to its high THCa focus, low other chemical content, and particular potency.\nBenefits of THCa Diamond Distillate\nTHCa diamond distillate is not only really pure and potent, but it also provides a host of benefits to users and patients looking for exact healing and non-psychoactive effects.\nThe following are only a few advantages:\nBenefits to Your Health One of the most vital aspects of THCa is its possible medical benefits. According to the study, THCa’s anti-inciting and anti-tumor effects make it a potential natural treatment for conditions like atonic, neurological disorders, and irritation-related issues.\nMoreover, it can be used as a pain reliever and may potentially have growth-inhibiting properties that are being studied in link with cancer treatment.\nBenefits of Psychoactivity For those who aim for the medical help of cannabis without any of the exciting side effects, THCa distillate may be the solution.\nTHCa does not make the same “high” as THC unless heated, so customers can incorporate it into their routine without worrying about getting stoned. For those who must consume cannabis but still need to retain mental clarity, this function is helpful.\nGive-in-use method Another crucial benefit of THCa diamond distillate is its compliance. It can be ingested, applied topically, or inhaled, among other methods. Because of its usefulness, users can choose the consuming technique that best suits their needs and preferences.\nTHCa can be used in various ways, such as nutrition for a slow-release effect, relevant creams for contained comfort, and breath for faster benefits. Due to its compliance, THCa distillate is edible and both healthy and fun for a broader range of users.\nTechniques for Consuming THCa Diamond Distillate\nTHCa diamond distillate is helpful in a wide range of situations.\nHere are a few of our favorites:\nDabbing Dabbing is a very potent way to consume THCa diamond distillate for those looking for quick effects. Take a tiny bit of distillate, melt it on a hot outside, and breathe in the gas.\nBecause dabbing offers control over overdosage and has a quick onset of effects, experienced users naturally favor it.\nTHCa Inclusion in Edibles Supplies containing THCa diamond distillate can be softly and ably ingested. By incorporating THCa distillate into recipes, users can enjoy its healing effects for longer.\nTopical Uses for Convenient Relief The use of topical THCa diamond distillate reduces pain in specific body areas. You can apply THCa diamond distillate directly into your skin to achieve local interest during lotions, creams, and balms.\nThe Legal setting of THCa Diamond Distillate\nNavigating the legal system can be testing because THCa diamond distillate has different legal statuses in other controls.\nTHCa diamond distillate falls into a gray area in certain situations because it is not psychotropic when not heated, unlike THC. This distinction is crucial in narrow support where rules divide cannabinoids resulting from hemp, such as CBDa, from those linked to moving effects, like THC.\nConclusion\nTHCa diamond distillate has been shown to have extraordinary possibilities in cannabis culture and medicine. This has led to increased interest in FDA regulation to ensure the safe and regular addition of THCa into the healthcare system.\nIts future versatility to suit diverse needs is colored by many intake techniques, which range from topical treatments to dabbing. Looking ahead, there is a promising move towards everyday cannabis products due to the increased taking of and study into the medical benefits of THCa.\nIn reality, THCa distillate has changed the public view of cannabis, positioning it as a vital tool in balancing and option treatment. Its potent healing properties and non-exciting character have been known and valued by medical professionals as well as patients. People can explore a natural approach to well-being and take advantage of the plant’s many benefits without having to cope with the adverse effects of usual pharmaceuticals thanks to the potential of THCa distillate. As research on THCa distillate’s full range of health effects continues, it has the potential to totally change holistic therapy by creating new avenues for release and renewal.",

    "text": "Estos serían los consumidores que no podrían sacar una membresía en Costco. Una empresa que tiene normas u reglamentos puede incrementar su productividad en un 13 por ciento, según UNE. Las marcas tienen límites que son aclarados en sus políticas de privacidad.\nLa cadena de tiendas al mayoreo Costco , se ha posicionado como una de las preferidas entre los mexicanos, ya sea por los pasteles, productos en tendencia y demás, pero ha surgido un tema, en el cual se ha dejado al descubierto a las personas que no podrían sacar nunca una membresía en el negocio.\nEl proceso para obtener una de las tres membresías de Costco es muy sencilla, sólo se debe de asistir a una sucursal y solicitar el trámite en el área de membresías, posteriormente pagar la cantidad de 500 pesos, en la Dorada y negocio, o mil 100 pesos para la ejecutiva.\nMembresías de Costco Recientemente, se trajo de vuelta el caso de un joven al cual se le habría negado el trámite de la membresía del Costco por su apellido , por lo que el joven relató su historia en redes, cuestión que en su momento llamó la atención.\nDe acuerdo a la versión del hombre, al tratar de sacar su membresía en dicha tienda pero el personal del lugar le indicó que esto no sería posible, debido a que su apellido era Pastor , el cual, según ellos, estaba completamente prohibido para su ingreso a los negocios de Costco en todo el mundo.\nLuego de que el hombre mencionó lo relacionado, usuarios en redes sociales indicaron que este estaba mintiendo, por lo que indicaron que algunos de sus familiares también tienen el mismo apellido y cuentan con una membresía, por lo que se mostró de manera única e inesperada.\nEsta situación, que se presentó en su momento, hizo que los consumidores consideraran que era real, cuestión que llamó la atención de propios y extraños por el caso, a lo que investigando se encontró que no existe un impedimento por características personales para obtener la membresía.\nSupuestamente a este cabrón le negaron la membresia de @Costco por apellidarse Pastor.\n🤣🤣🤣🤣\nYo digo que es puro pedo pero.\n¿Ustedes que opinan? pic.twitter.com/K5qeElQh11\n— ▕⃝⃤⁩⁩ Alquimista▕⃝⃤⁩⁩ (@Librattus) May 11, 2024\nCondiciones de marcas Las condiciones que las marcas imponen a los consumidores son un aspecto clave de la relación comercial, influyendo en cómo se percibe la marca y en la experiencia general del cliente.\nEstas condiciones abarcan desde términos de servicio y políticas de devolución hasta restricciones sobre el uso de productos o servicios. Si bien son necesarias para proteger los intereses de las empresas, también pueden afectar la satisfacción y lealtad de los consumidores si no se gestionan adecuadamente.\nUna de las áreas más comunes en las que las marcas imponen condiciones es en los términos y condiciones de venta, que suelen incluir detalles sobre la garantía de los productos, las políticas de devolución y reembolso, y las limitaciones de responsabilidad.\nEstas condiciones están diseñadas para proteger a la empresa de posibles pérdidas y litigios, pero pueden ser vistas como restrictivas por los consumidores si no se comunican de manera clara y justa. Por ejemplo, políticas de devolución estrictas o complejas pueden disuadir a los clientes de hacer compras o generar frustración si no se cumplen sus expectativas.\nOtro aspecto es el uso de productos o servicios bajo licencias específicas, donde las marcas pueden imponer restricciones sobre cómo y dónde se puede utilizar el producto.\nLas marcas también pueden imponer condiciones a través de programas de fidelización o membresías, que ofrecen beneficios adicionales a los clientes, pero con ciertas condiciones, como la necesidad de alcanzar un umbral de gasto o la renovación periódica de la suscripción.\nAmazon Un ejemplo relevante es Amazon, que ofrece su servicio de membresía Prime con numerosas ventajas, como envíos rápidos y acceso a contenido exclusivo.\nSin embargo, la suscripción a Prime incluye condiciones como la renovación automática y el cobro de tarifas mensuales o anuales, lo que puede sorprender a algunos consumidores si no están completamente al tanto de los términos.\nLee también:\n¡Golpe a gamers!

    "text": "KINGSTON, R.I. — April 4, 2024 – University of Rhode Island student volunteers danced the day away on a recent Sunday to benefit children with life-threatening and chronic illnesses. The volunteers and participants of RhodyTHON 2024 had much to celebrate at the conclusion of the dance marathon by raising more than $52,000 for Hasbro Children’s Hospital, a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. RhodyTHON began at 10 a.m. and ended at 8 p.m. in Mackal Field House, during which participants enjoyed a variety of activities, games and performances from student organizations. Run by student volunteers, the event attracted more than 600 people, including 100 who registered that day. A moving and energetic day, the big reveal came at the end, when student organizers Grace Heppes and Gabrielle Pino, both URI seniors, unveiled the amount raised this year. “There’s a feeling you get the day of the event that we talk about, us on the executive board and really anyone else who comes, and if you haven’t been there you won’t know what it’s like until you have,” says Heppes, of Otisville, New York, a clinical neuroscience major with minors in leadership studies and special populations. “It is such a special and indescribable feeling. It is so rewarding to know how much of an impact we have made. It is a rare opportunity to make such a difference while having the time of your life.” Heppes and Pino, of Ewa Beach, Hawai’i, a double major in film media and communications, with a minor in general business, had been preparing for RhodyTHON since last years’ event. As executive director and communications director, respectively, they are members of an executive board with 25 members. “Throughout the year, the RhodyTHON communications team worked toward creating infographics and videos to encourage members of the URI Community to register for Donor Drive until the main event,” Pino said. “Knowing the impact social media has on various communities, we were able to dedicate hourly posts for each Miracle Child to fundraise a certain amount based on their stories. During the main event, it was heartwarming to see everyone posting on their social media accounts to spread the love and joy RhodyTHON brings to the URI community.” Members of the organization undertook individual challenges during the year to raise money for the program. They also participated in group fundraising. Heppes did a push up for each dollar donation she received, while Pino accepted donations of $5 every time someone cracked an egg over her head. Heppes was inspired to get involved with Rhodython by her older sister, who founded another Miracle Network Dance Marathon fundraiser, “BomberTHON,” while attending Ithaca College in New York. When Heppes contacted the URI organization in October as a first-year student in 2020, there was just one position open on the RhodyTHON executive board. She describes the uncertain return of RhodyTHON after the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of time that influenced her entire URI experience, including her efforts to spread awareness and encourage the URI community and beyond to register for this event. Each of the 10 hours that made up RhodyTHON were devoted to an individual Miracle Child. At the top of each hour, choreographed “morale” dance performances kicked off the incoming series of dedicated activities. Dancers and children and their families enjoyed various crafts and snacks, all tailored to the interests of each Miracle Child during their hour. The Miracle Children and their families walked down a red carpet to begin their honorary time period. Mailboxes located near seats for the Miracle Children and their families allowed attendees to drop off letters of encouragement, praise and comfort. Apparatus from URI Emergency Medical Services and the Kingston Fire Department were available for children to explore outside the Mackal Field House. URI students recognized the familiar sight of URI Police Cpl. Paul Hanrahan serving up good, old-fashioned, hot dogs. One of the Miracle Kids set up a lemonade stand he built last summer to assist the fundraising effort. Those interested may still make a donation online .
