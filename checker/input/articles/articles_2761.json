    "title": "Is Arizona an ‘emerging problem’ for Donald Trump? What to know",
    "text": "PHOENIX - Arizona used to be a near-foregone conclusion for Donald Trump . Now it’s an “emerging problem,\" according to one longtime political observer. Vice President Kamala Harris is rising in battleground state polls and drew thousands to a political rally in Glendale, Ariz., last week, establishing herself as a more formidable Trump opponent than President Joe Biden was. Now, Republicans wonder whether Trump has been present in Arizona enough and say he is losing ground to Democrats. “They're on their back foot,” said Chuck Coughlin, a longtime GOP strategist who left the party during the Trump era. “Arizona clearly is an emerging problem for him.” Trump could address some of those criticisms in person as soon as next week. The former president is weighing a trip to Arizona’s southern border in Cochise County, where the U.S.-Mexico border runs for 84 miles. The region is home to two ports of entry: Douglas and Naco. Sierra Vista Mayor Clea McCaa and Sierra Vista police Chief Chris Hiser will be present for Trump’s visit, a city spokesperson said on Wednesday. It is not clear what day Trump might visit the county, and the former president’s campaign declined to answer questions about his travel plans. Arizona is a top campaign destination for presidential candidates because it is among a handful of states that could decide the outcome of the 2024 election. Trump lost here by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020, the smallest margin of any state on the electoral map. It was the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had won in Arizona since 1996 and only the second time since 1948. Democrats had all but given up on Arizona’s presidential prospects at the beginning of the summer, but the well-choreographed swap at the top of the ticket has injected new enthusiasm in the party. Harris held smaller Arizona events during her tenure as vice president but drew a crowd of 15,000 to Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale last week for her first Arizona appearance as the Democratic nominee. Trump addressed some 4,000 people at a rally at Dream City Church in Phoenix in June. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report just changed its Arizona presidential election forecast from “lean Republican” to “toss-up,” and a survey from Coughlin’s polling firm HighGround found Harris narrowly leading Trump in Arizona 44% to 42% among likely voters. (The HighGround survey was conducted July 30-Aug. 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points). “I didn't think Democrats thought they could win out here,” Coughlin said. “Now they're like, oh ... we might be able to win this thing.” The Trump campaign has put more resources into Arizona lately, dispatching vice presidential nominee JD Vance for a rally and border tour in Cochise County, the same region Trump is considering visiting. Trump and his allies are also pouring millions into TV ad buys to attack Harris on immigration and the economy. MAGA Inc. just announced a $100 million TV ad buy across the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, POLITICO reported . “It's hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes, just how bad the policies of the Kamala Harris administration have been when it comes to the southern border,” Vance said during his trip to the border wall, making sure to attack Harris on one of her most vulnerable issues. Trump has veered off track with his messaging, though, according to one of his Arizona backers. Trump “never stops speaking” and should stick to a campaign message that can broaden his coalition, said Arizona Republican Alberto Gutier, who served as a Trump elector in 2016. “Trump can still win it, but he’s gonna have to solidify what's left of the party,” Gutier said, pointing to struggles Arizona Republicans have faced in recent years. The GOP lost three Senate races, the Governor’s Office, the Secretary of State’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office during the Trump era. For its part, the Trump campaign said his momentum is growing and attacked Harris on the economy and the border. “Everything — from rent, groceries to gas — is far more expensive under Kamala Harris. Under her failed leadership, Arizona families have experienced record high prices and an unruly border crisis; our communities have been less safe, and deadly drugs are killing our youth. President Trump offers Arizona voters hope through his agenda to make Arizona safe and affordable again,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Halee Dobbins said in a written statement. \"The momentum is only growing for Trump ahead of November as voters grow sick and tired of Harris’ lies and unlivable policies; Arizona won’t buy her gaslighting this fall.\"But Gutier said he’s worried that Harris appeals to a noteworthy voting group that could help sway the election result. “Here in Arizona, young people, a lot of people who have not been involved in politics, see her as a savior,” Gutier said. “Good luck, America.” Still, Trump just got a boost from a top Arizona Republican whom he butted heads with in the past. Former GOP Gov. Doug Ducey endorsed Trump on Tuesday, putting his “differences aside” to back the former president who once said Ducey was betraying Arizona by certifying the 2020 election results. “Differences aside, there is too much on the line and only a Republican in the White House and a majority in the House and US Senate can ensure it,” Ducey said, throwing his support behind Trump and GOP Senate nominee Kari Lake. No charges: Why Arizona Attorney General Mayes didn't want to indict Trump in fake elector case He also received praise from the Arizona Republican Party chair for taking questions from billionaire Trump booster Elon Musk during a lengthy livestream on Musk’s social media site. Harris has taken few questions from reporters since she became her party’s nominee. “The conversation between President Trump and Elon Musk on X Spaces again demonstrated President Trump's commitment to transparency and direct engagement with the American people,” Arizona GOP Chair Gina Swoboda said in a written statement. “In stark contrast, Kamala Harris has been noticeably absent from the media for over three weeks.” When it comes to campaigning offline, Trump has a lighter footprint than the Harris operation in Arizona. The Trump campaign has eight offices here, compared with Harris’ 12, though it says it has plans to open more ahead of the election. Trump offices are in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Casa Grande, Sun City, Chandler, Mesa, Tucson and Kingman. The campaign also holds “Super Saturday” training sessions for volunteers around the state. “The Harris-Walz campaign has seen a surge of momentum as voters are responding to Vice President Harris’ fight to bring down costs, secure the border, and make sure Arizona families don’t just get by but get ahead,” Harris spokesperson Jacques Petit said in a written statement. “Meanwhile Donald Trump and JD Vance have almost no presence in the state and are running on a toxic Project 2025 agenda to ban abortion in Arizona and slash Medicare and Social Security, which is why Republicans, Democrats and Independents are coming together to defeat them and deliver the White House for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.”",

    "text": "By Ashley Sharp Click here for updates on this story ROSEVILLE, California ( KPIX ) — Horse heroes took the reins in Roseville as firefighters battled a 16-acre vegetation fire that was inching closer and closer to a neighborhood off of PFE Road and Watt Avenue on Thursday evening. The flames were too close for onlooker Tristan Hamm, watching the fire head right in the direction of a barn full of about 30 horses. It’s why he jumped into action. “This field behind the barn, all that was on fire. Just ripped smoke into the barn. Those horses were just covered in smoke,” Hamm said. “I ran over and peeked over the fence, then [a worker] said, ‘Please help me.’ “ Hamm and his friend Travis Nunes, who lives just a block over from the fire, went into the barn to help get the horses to safety. They were met with frightened horses and a barn filling with smoke. “That barn is packed to the roof with hay, I noticed right away. If a single thing flew into that barn it was lighting up in seconds,” Hamm said. Neighbors also rallied alongside the two men, helping come to the rescue. “Immediately my friend Travis started going house to house and getting people to come over,” Hamm said. One by one, Hamm and Nunes helped quickly get the horses harnessed up and allowed neighbors to lead them out of the barn and to safety on the street. They were watching them closely as fire crews closed in on the flames. Firefighters were able to stop the fire just before it reached the property housing the barn. “The community is so tight and the people are so good and everybody was helping. It was just amazing to see,” Hamm said. Hamm is a professional boxer and social media influencer from Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada. He also owns an adventure company Revived Outdoors. He just happened to be in the neighborhood staying with Nunes when the fire broke out. “It was meant to be, right place right time. The barn didn’t burn down, the horses are all good. But they still were in harm’s way with the smoke,” said Hamm. He feels they did the right thing and is happy that neighbors came to the rescue as well. With fire season in full swing, he hopes it is a reminder to take the reins when it is safe and lend a helping hand if possible. Workers at the barn Friday did not want to be interviewed for this story but confirmed all the horses got back inside safely. Cal Fire and Placer County Fire Department crews were able to get full containment on the fire Thursday night just after 8 p.m. No one was hurt and no structures burned.

The Russian Navy’s previous losses included the Moskva cruiser, which was the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, the Novecherkassk large landing ship, the Rostov-on-Don submarine, and multiple other vessels.\n“Overnight from 31 January to 1 February 2024, soldiers of the HUR’s Group 13 special unit destroyed the Ivanovets missile boat of the Russian Black Sea Fleet,” HUR\n[reported].\nThe Ivanovets was a Russian missile corvette of the Soviet Project 1241 Molniya (NATO designation: Tarantul-class). Russia reportedly operates 20 ships of this class, four of which are part of the Black Sea Fleet.\nUkraine reports the successful sinking of the Ivanovets, a Russian missile corvette, in the Black Sea. It's at least the 17th Russian ship destroyed/damaged during the all-out war.\n [pic.twitter.com/y0Aiuj83k1]\n— Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress)\n[February 1, 2024]\nAccording to the Directorate, the Russian naval vessel was patrolling the Black Sea near Lake Donuzlav off the western coast of the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula.\n“Due to a series of direct hits to the hull, the Russian ship sustained damage incompatible with further movement, the Ivanovets heeled to the stern and sank. The cost of the ship lost by the aggressor state is approximately $60-70 million,” HUR noted.\nIn its report, the intelligence agency did not mention the weapon used in the attack, but the footage it shared shows the first-person view of a surface uncrewed vessel attack on the Russian ship.\nHUR says its preliminary reports showed that the search and rescue operation of the Russian forces at Donuzlav was unsuccessful.\n“The operation was made possible with the support of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and the United24 platform,” HUR wrote.\nIn December 2023, the UK Defense Secretary\nstated that 20% of Russia’s Black Sea fleet had been destroyed by Ukraine over four previous months.\nRead also:\nUkraine unveils FURY: new weapon to dominate the Black Sea UK Defense Minister: 20% of Russia’s Black Sea fleet destroyed over past four months What Russian Black Sea Fleet ships were destroyed by Ukraine Photo shows submerged wreckage of Novocherkassk landing ship as Russia claims Ukrainian attack just damaged it",

    "text": "Troy L. Sayles Men's Basketball 1/16/2025 3:00:00 PM Troy L. Sayles, Associate Director of Athletic Communications Billy Taylor Earns Hugh Durham Award Midseason Coaching Honor ELON, N.C. – Elon University men's basketball head coach Billy Taylor was recognized as the recipient of the Hugh Durham Award midseason coaching honor as announced by CollegeInsider.com on Thursday, Jan. 16. The Hugh Durham Award is presented annually to the top mid-major college basketball coach in Division I. Taylor has led the Phoenix to one of its best starts in its Division I history this season. Elon is 12-5 on the year for its best 17-game start in school history during its Division I era. The maroon and gold has also started 3-1 in the CAA for its best league start since 2017-18 and is currently unbeaten at 7-0 on its home floor at Schar Center. Among the notable victories this season for the Phoenix includes Elon's 84-77 win at Notre Dame on Nov. 22. It was Elon's first win over a Power 4 opponent since 2012 and its first win over an ACC foe since 2005. The Phoenix also received its highest NCAA Net ranking in school history at No. 82 and currently sits at No. 124, the second-highest in the CAA. The Phoenix has four players averaging double-figures in scoring and is one of the top defensive teams in the country. Elon ranks 11th in nation, holding opponents to 37.9 percent from the field. They are also ranked fourth nationally in rebounds per game (43.4) and sixth in the NCAA in rebound margin (+11.0). The Hugh Durham Award is presented annually to the nation's top mid-major coach. The award is named in honor of Hugh Durham who had retired at the end of the 2004-05 season. Durham is one of just twelve coaches to have led two different programs to the NCAA Final Four (Florida State in 1972 and Georgia in 1983). He is the only coach among that group to have led both schools to their lone Final Four appearance. The Phoenix is back on the court this evening at Drexel with game time scheduled for 7 p.m. -- ELON -- Print Friendly Version",

    "text": "本报记者 邹倜然 本报通讯员 孙智慧\n今年“五一”前夕，曹操出行原永辉、张桂容、刘滨杰3位司机，凭借高质量的服务水平获评全国劳动模范。曹操出行成为全国网约车行业唯一一个同时拥有3位全国劳模司机的平台。\n6月25日，3位全国劳模司机登上香港联交所，与曹操出行管理层共同见证代表公司上市交易的金锣鸣响。网约车司机作为公司上市主礼嘉宾，这在港交所还是第一次。\n两个“首次”的背后，是曹操出行对司机群体一如既往的重视与关爱。近年来，曹操出行通过夯实培训教育平台建设、创新评先评优表彰体系，并通过“金牌导师司机”机制进一步加强“传帮带”，打造“全链式”劳模先进培养平台。\n“我们身处杭州这块创新热土、工匠之城、服务标杆之地，要用安全、专业、温暖、高效的出行服务，擦亮‘曹操出行’的品牌，在建设杭州新天堂、服务人民美好出行的实践中，展现新时代劳动者的卓越风采！”曹操出行CEO龚昕表示。\n“线上+线下”培训融入职业发展\n为全面提升曹操出行驾驶员队伍的综合素养与服务水平，曹操出行创新推出“司机微课堂”培训体系，严格遵循“‘政治课’打头、‘专业课’赋能、‘素质课’提效”的核心要求，深度融合“线上+线下”“集中+分散”的灵活模式，将教育培训融入司机职业发展全链条。\n曹操出行党委书记、工会主席戴启文介绍，“政治课”聚焦党的创新理论、最新政策解读，引导司机群体深刻理解国家发展大局与行业使命，增强职业荣誉感、社会责任感和爱党爱国情怀；“专业课”着力提升司机安全驾驶水平、应急处置能力、车辆维护技能和合规运营意识，有效降低事故率、违章率和投诉率，筑牢业务安全防线；“素质课” 则强化职业素养与职业道德，全面提升司机服务意识、沟通能力和人文素养，塑造专业、温暖、可信赖的“曹操使者”形象。\n“这些课程线下可以在运营中心进行学习，APP上还有专门打造的‘学习模块’。”曹操出行司机李凯师傅打开手机向记者展示，“点进去就可以随时随地学习。”\n不漏过每位司机的每次闪光\n“先进模范不仅业务过硬，也应当具备良好的品德。曹操出行的司机群体在不断壮大的同时，也涌现出了众多优秀的司机师傅。我们希望，他们的优秀事迹，能够激励更多司机师傅为共建美好社会而努力。”曹操出行有关负责人表示。\n近日，曹操出行正式启动“寻光计划”，并设立“曹家好司机”奖项，旨在奖励日常生活中做出善举的司机师傅。据了解，如果司机做过好人好事，或主动提供其他司机好人好事相关线索，即可联系当地司管人员申报。\n“曹家好司机”的标准，分为优质服务和见义勇为两大类。其中，乘客或路人突发疾病送医、主动送行动不便的老人回家为优质服务。见义勇为则包含路边救火、帮助抓小偷、阻止违法犯罪行为、阻止乘客遭受诈骗、及时劝阻乘客或路人轻生、车祸火灾现场拯救幸存者。\n台州司机蔡师傅就是首期“曹家好司机”之一。2024年，他协助警方抓获诈骗分子，挽回乘客损失6.8万元。谈到这次获奖，他十分开心。\n“很高兴能获得这样的荣誉，这是对我的认可也是对我的激励。今后我会在网约车司机的岗位上继续为乘客提供优质、安全的出行服务！”蔡师傅说。\n不漏过每位司机的每次闪光，近年来曹操出行持续开展“红旗车队”“金牌车队长”“五星服务之星”“安全行车标兵”“见义勇为好司机”等多元评选活动。日常工作中，工会干部和积极分子注重深入一线，发掘、培养、跟踪、宣传优秀司机典型。\n人人学先进，人人当先进\n为进一步发挥劳模先进的示范作用，曹操出行选拔一批服务星级高、安全记录好、沟通能力强、乐于分享的优秀车队长、服务明星司机，聘任为平台“金牌导师司机”。通过线上直播/录播经验分享、线下“跟车实习”指导、组建“师徒结对小组”、定期举办“导师沙龙”等方式，进行业务技能、服务标准、安全理念和职业素养的“传帮带”，加速新司机成长，促进经验传承。\n司机赵明松，就是全国劳模原永辉手把手带出来的徒弟。\n“那是我第一次出车，乘客却‘失联’了。”赵明松回忆道，在他焦急万分时，队长原永辉在群里的一句“沉住气，原地等，我来联系”，瞬间稳住了他的心。原永辉迅速解决问题，让赵明松感受到团队的支撑。两人就此结下了师徒的缘分。\n在原永辉倾囊相授下，赵明松在驾驶技术与服务方面越来越精进，参与了杭州亚运会、亚残运会等大赛服务保障。凭借扎实的技艺和卓越的服务，赵明松先后荣获“杭州市最美司机”和“滨江区优秀党员司机”称号。站在颁奖台上，他动情地说：“从前师傅总说‘沟通的事，有我在呢’。今天我想说，师傅放心，以后这路，有我们接着开，稳稳地开！”\n连续5年组织“爱心送考”活动，高考期间为考生提供免费、优先接送服务，累计服务考生超1万人次；开展“社区公益行”，为孤寡老人、残障人士提供免费就医接送、生活物资代购等服务；组织司机参与“无偿献血”公益活动……曹操出行工会牵头组织或积极对接社会需求，引导司机群体投身公益，极大提升了司机群体的社会形象和自我价值认同。\n关于中工网 | 版权声明 | 违法和不良信息举报电话：010-84151598 | 网络敲诈和有偿删帖举报电话：010-84151598\nCopyright © 2008-2025 by www.workercn.cn. all rights reserved",

    "text": "Dell missed on sales but beat on earnings for the fourth quarter. The company said it sold about $10 billion of AI-optimized servers in its fiscal 2025, and expects to sell about $15 billion in AI system in the current year. Dell reported fourth-quarter sales that fell short of analysts’ estimates but earnings topped Wall Street expectations.\nHere’s how the hardware company did versus LSEG consensus estimates:\nRevenue : $23.9 billion, versus $24.55 billion estimated EPS : $2.68, adjusted, versus $2.53 estimated. Dell shares are down less than 5% so far in 2025, but the company’s stock has more than doubled in the last two years due to soaring demand for artificial intelligence systems, often based around Nvidia graphics processing chips. Dell sells Nvidia-based servers to Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, and said it had $4.1 billion in backlogged AI server orders at the end of January.\nDell said it sold about $10 billion of AI-optimized servers in its fiscal 2025, and expects to sell about $15 billion in AI system sales in the current year.\nCurrent quarter revenue will be between $22.5 and $23.5 billion, Dell said, trailing the average estimate of $23.59 billion, according to LSEG. The company guided for adjusted earnings per share during the quarter of $1.65, versus $1.76 estimated by analysts.\nDell expects between $101 billion and $105 billion of revenue in its fiscal 2026, about inline with LSEG estimates of $103.17 billion. Earnings per share for the full year will be $9.30, the company said, topping estimates of of $9.23\nNet income increased to $1.53 billion, or $2.15 per share, from $1.21 billion, or $1.66 per share, in the year-ago period.\nDell raised its dividend by 18% and announced $10 billion in share repurchase authorization.\nRevenue rose 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by the company’s Infrastructure Solutions Group, its server division, which saw sales rise 22% to $11.35 billion. That was under a StreetAccount estimate of $11.7 billion in sales.\nDell’s client solutions group, its biggest business, saw sales rise 5% to $11.88 billion, due to a sluggish laptop market. StreetAccount was expecting $11.98 billion in revenue.\nDell revealed on Thursday that it had discovered that some of its suppliers had given it credits that were not recorded or that were recorded at the wrong time. The impact was “not material,” Dell said, adding that it had restated prior financial statements in 2024 and 2025.\n“The company initiated an investigation that indicated that the credits resulted from the actions of certain employees that support a limited number of suppliers, impacting the Client Solutions Group segment and overstating cost of goods sold by approximately $200 million in fiscal 2024 and $148 million in fiscal 2025 for the nine months ended November 1, 2024,” Dell said in its press release.\nWATCH: Dell nears deal to sell $5 billion in AI servers to xAI",
