    "title": "WATCH: Waves Topple Pier, Woman Caught in Surge During Crazy California Swell",
    "text": "A massive swell is absolutely pummeling California right now.\nIn fact, it’s not just one swell; rather, a flurry of swells. Accordingly, surfers and surf spectators are flocking to the beaches up and down the coast to: 1) watch the swell from the presumed safety of the shore (not always the case), or 2) paddle out.\nBut in some cases, and at some spots, there’s a little too much swell.\nView the original article to see embedded media.\nLike Capitola, CA – north of Big Sur, and south of surfing hotspots like Santa Cruz and the Golden State’s most revered big-wave spot, Mavericks, in Half Moon Bay.\nOn Thursday, December 28 th , the swell was so big, so strong, so mighty that waves were washing over the pier (see above) and a rogue wave nearly swept a woman out to sea (see below).\nChaos in Capitola.\nJust north, at Mavericks, a similar scene went down when a sneaker wave washed ashore and took down a flock of spectators trying to get a glimpse of California’s premier big-wave surfing destination. It was like a wet mop going at a trail of ants.\nThis is just the beginning, too. More is on the way.\nHere’s the latest from surf forecasters, Surfline , regarding this run of swell:\nIt’s already been an eventful week in California – especially north of Point Conception – and there is more to come. Finding the windows of favorable wind in between storms will be a challenge. Things to note:\n-Solid to locally XXL W-WNW swell Thu-Fri for California\n- Stormy wind for NorCal with some brief windows, SoCal AM wind is generally light\n- Another big W swell arrives over the weekend but wind is pretty tough statewide\nStay tuned; stay safe.\n***\nDon't miss another headline from SURFER!

    "text": "Yahoo News 3 Kansas City Chiefs fans were found dead at a friend's home. Here's what we know about what happened. The homeowner told family members the three pals \"froze to death.\" Chanelle Chandler · Reporter Updated January 26, 2024 at 12:15 AM · 5 min read 2.6k Left to right: Ricky Johnson, David Harrington and Clayton McGeeney (Via Facebook (3))\nThree men were found dead outside their friend’s Kansas City, Mo., home on Jan. 9, two days after they went over to watch a Chiefs game. Now loved ones are demanding answers following weeks of what they say are inconsistent details from the men’s friend and attorney surrounding the timeline of the mysterious deaths. And news of a fifth man who attended the gathering that night has fueled even more speculation among family and friends.\nWhat’s happened High school friends Clayton McGeeney, 36, David Harrington, 37, and Ricky Johnson, 38, were found dead in the backyard of the rental home of their friend, Jordan Willis, police said. Willis had invited them to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Los Angeles Chargers.\nTwo days after the game, McGeeney’s fianceé visited the house to check on him after not hearing from him — and said she found a body on the back porch, the Kansas City Police Department told Yahoo News. She called the police and when officers arrived, they discovered two more dead bodies in the snow-filled backyard.\nConflicting accounts of what really happened that night On Jan. 20, Willis’s attorney, John Picerno, told a local news outlet that after the game ended, the three men left the house and Willis went to bed. That was the last time Willis saw them, according to Picerno.\nBut on Jan. 22, an unidentified fifth man — whose presence was not known in earlier accounts of the case — said he was also watching the game at Willis’s house that night. His attorney, Andrew Talge, said his client arrived at the house around 7 p.m. and left at midnight. The man told the local Fox 4 affiliate that Willis, McGeeney, Harrington and Johnson were awake watching Jeopardy! when he left the home.\nPicerno confirmed to the news outlet there was a fifth man at his client’s house that day. He said that Willis \"got tired and went to sleep while there were these guys in the home, and as I know now there was a couple of other people in the home.\"\nOn Jan. 24, Picerno clarified the timeline telling Fox News Digital that the fifth man left the house first. Willis then said goodbye to Johnson, Harrington and McGeeney, before falling asleep on the couch.\nBut an attorney for Ricky Johnson’s family has called out apparent inconsistencies in the story.\n\"Initially, he was by himself; now there was a fifth magical person who was at the house,\" Ross Nigro told Fox News Digital . \"The fact that the story has changed significantly makes it seem unbelievable and not trustworthy whatsoever. In addition to Mr. Willis leaving the residence and hiring a criminal defense attorney, those are all signs of someone hiding something,\" Nigro said.\nYahoo News reached out to Picerno for comment.\nTwo days of no response Jordan Willis. (via Github)\nDuring the days leading up to the discovery of the bodies, Picerno said that Willis worked from home, sleeping most of the time before police arrived, according to USA Today .\nMultiple outlets have reported that after concerned friends and family had not heard from the men after the football game, they and the fifth man tried to contact Willis, but he did not respond.\nAccording to the local Fox affiliate, Picerno also acknowledged that two people came to the house but Willis had been sleeping with earbuds near a fan and didn’t hear them.\nBut Willis answered the door for police when they arrived, wearing just his underwear while gripping an empty glass of wine.\nFamily say Willis’s story has ‘a lot of holes in it’ A family member told Fox 4 that Willis claimed to them his friends “froze to death.”\nBut the families have said Willis's account of the night does not add up, including his claim that he slept for most of the two days and did not know there were dead bodies in his yard.\n“It’s got a lot of holes in it, like last time he saw them they were leaving the house, but he didn’t know they had left, that doesn’t make much sense,\" Alan McGeeney, a cousin of Clayton McGeeney told Fox 4 .\nJennifer Marquez, Harrington’s mother, told News Nation Now that neither the families nor friends believe Willis’s story.\n“He’s not telling the whole story. He’s covering something up,” Marquez alleged in another News Nation report. “If your telling the truth, the story should be the same.”\nRicky Johnson Sr. acknowledged in an interview with Fox News Digital that while his son may have used drugs before, he did not believe the three men “did drugs and fell over dead.\"\n\"I’m not going to say that during a game he didn’t have some drinks. But he wasn’t irresponsible that he was going to go outside and freeze to death,\" continued Johnson.\nBut Willis’s attorney has pushed back at the accusations that his client was involved in the men’s deaths.\n\"Jordan had absolutely nothing to do with their deaths. He does not know the timing or manner of their deaths, nor does he know how or when they exited his house,\" Picerno told CBS News .\n\"The number one thing that people need to remember from our point of view is that these were his three buddies. If they were in danger, he would’ve helped them,\" Picerno told Fox News Digital. \"If he knew they were out there, he would’ve called the police himself. Anything beyond that is pure speculation.\"\nWhat police have said The Kansas City Police Department said they’re probing this case as a “death investigation” and that “no foul play was observed or suspected.”\nWillis “was cooperative with detectives the day the deceased were discovered,” the department told Yahoo News via email.\n“There have not been any arrests/charges, and no one is in custody. There are no specific threats or concerns for the surrounding community at this time. The next step in the investigation is to receive the findings (preliminary or final) from the medical examiner,” the statement continued.\nA local medical examiner conducted autopsies on the bodies and the results are pending.\nView comments",

    "title": "New Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Yahoo Warning—Do Not Open These Black Friday Emails",
    "text": "A stark new warning has just been issued ahead of the holidays. The deluge of Black Friday spam emails hitting mailboxes across all the most popular platforms is much more dangerous than you might think. Being pushed to “buy now” is actually the least of your worries. The advice is simple for Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail and Yahoo users: Do not open these emails, delete them from your inbox right away.\nBitdefender has been monitoring Black Friday themed spam emails since last month, and warns that “cybercriminals have wasted no time trying to capitalize on the frenzy.” While this includes the usual plague of “phishing emails impersonating trusted brands,” the researchers warn that this holiday season has proven “fertile ground” for more malicious types of threats.\nThe incredible headline number is that 3 out of every 4 Black Friday themed spam emails is now a scam. That might mean it’s a phishing lure to steal your credentials of card details, or it might be seeking to plant malware on your device. Gone are the days when the biggest threat was a so-called marketing lure, “emails designed to drive traffic to legitimate but overly aggressive promotions.” This is bad for you and bad for all the brands trying to reach you—even if they’re a bit pushy in doing so.\nForbes Samsung’s Upgrade Decision—Bad News For Millions Of Galaxy S24, S23 And S22 Owners By Zak Doffman This new 77% figure is up almost a third from two years ago and is increasing year-on-year. It means that on balance of probability, almost every Black Friday marketing email you see could be a threat and is almost certainly fraudulent. And with new tricks to better copy legitimate brands to trick you into clicking or buying, you should simply visit websites the usual way rather than clicking through.\nElon Musk Apparently Just Became The No. 1 ‘Diablo 4’ Player In The World Stop Using Your Passwords—1Password And Google Warn No, Your Gmail Isn’t Truly Private—2 Ways To Fix That Bitdefender reports that “the US and Europe remain the top targets: The United States received 38% of all Black Friday-themed spam, while Europe accounted for 44% of global spam activity, with Germany and France among the most targeted countries... 66% of Black Friday-themed spam originated from the US, while Europe accounts for 23% of spam origin, with countries such as France, the Netherlands and Germany leading. Countries in Asia are also present, with 6% of Black Friday spam (by volume) sent from IP addresses in Indonesia, Japan, and China.”\nUnsurprisingly, scammers tailor their campaigns to lure users looking into the most popular product categories and brands—phones, household electronics, gadgets and fashion. “One of the most notable features of Black Friday scam campaigns this year is their diversity. Scammers have tailored their messages and tactics to appeal to different groups of shoppers, ranging from tech enthusiasts to fashion aficionados, with campaigns targeting various demographics and regions.”\nSpecific tricks highlighted by Bitdefender include:\n“Fraudulent emails impersonating Fnac in Spain: falsely claimed that users’ orders (e.g., iPhones) were ready for shipment, with a PDF attachment delivering the Grandoreiro Trojan to steal banking credentials. Fake gadget deals: Scammers impersonated brands like Amazon to offer unbelievable discounts on smartphones, tablets, and other electronics. Luxury Handbag Fraud: Fake websites mimicked designer brands like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Chanel to lure buyers with deep discounts. Ray-Ban Sunglasses Scam: Phishing emails advertised Ray-Ban sunglasses for as little as $27.99, redirecting users to phony sites. Fake Shein offers targeting France and Italy: Fraudulent ads claimed to offer Shein Mystery Box discounts, tricking users into submitting payment details. Survey Scams: offering exclusive from Tesco and Costco, tricking victims into sharing sensitive details under the guise of Black Friday promotions. Tesla/Elon Musk Endorsements: a scam campaign promoting the “Alpha Heater” falsely claimed to be endorsed by Elon Musk.” While the usual phishing advice is to check URLs and look for telltale signs that an email is fake, the scale of the Black Friday campaigns is so pervasive that you’re better off looking at the headlines and if you like the promotion to go and visit the site itself. If it looks like spam, avoid it. If it is a brand you trust and you’re certain the email is legitimate, then go ahead and open it. But I would certainly advise against clicking directly through on any links within those emails.\nRemember, it’s not just phishing tricks you need to watch for. Emails designed to deliver malware to your device could remain hidden, quietly stealing your credentials and other personal date, without you ever realizing.\nWe have already seen a range of threats this holiday season targeting users of the most popular email platforms and web browsers, including SEO poisoning to push malicious campaigns directly into Google’s search results, increasingly sophisticated phishing lures and brand impersonation advances .\nKaspersky has warned online shoppers this holiday season that “scammers often impersonate major retailers like Amazon, Walmart or Etsy with deceptive emails to lure unsuspecting victims. These emails typically claim to come from the companies themselves and promote exclusive discounts, especially during high-traffic shopping periods like Black Friday... Emails designed to exploit the urgency and excitement of seasonal sales to trick consumers into clicking potentially dangerous links.”\nForbes Apple Confirms New Update Choice—Millions Of iPhone Owners Must Now Decide By Zak Doffman The lures are clever. The bad actors know your guard will be up given all these phishing warnings, and so they are designed to overcome this with a sense of urgency and a fear of missing out. “The catch is always the same: act quickly, or risk missing out on the ‘exclusive’ offer,” Kaspersky explains. “In reality, there is no deal — just a carefully designed scam aimed at manipulating victims into making small payments to the scammers, thus losing money and giving away their payment details.”\nStick to the FBI’s advice:“If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is! Steer clear of unfamiliar sites offering unrealistic discounts on brand-name merchandise. Scammers frequently prey on Black Friday and Cyber Monday bargain hunters by advertising ‘One-Day Only’ promotions from recognized brands. Without a skeptical eye, consumers may end up paying for an item, giving away personal information, and receive nothing in return except a compromised identity.”",

    "text": "GREAT FALLS, Mont. - Saturday begins a new era for Malmstrom Air Force Base as they welcome in the new MH-139 Grey Wolf Helicopters.\n\"It is a great day for MAFB, it is a great day for Great Falls, it's a great day for North Central Montana, it is a great day for Montana, and it is a great day for this nation,\" said Montana Senator Jon Tester.\nWe first told you about these new helicopters in 2020.\n\"It [the Grey Wolf] provides the tools, techniques, and procedures because of the inherent capabilities of this platform,\" said General Thomas Bussiere, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command.\nThe Grey Wolf features unmatched system integration, a state of the art avionics system, and advanced flight deck functionality.\nSome of the key benefits of the new aircraft include:\nCruises 50% faster, flies 50% farther, has a 30% larger cabin, and can lift 5,000 more pounds than the legacy platform, while introducing full autopilot capability to reduce pilot workload. State-of-the-art avionics system with advanced flight deck functionality and improved situational awareness resulting in reduced crew workload. Right-sized aircraft for maximum operational efficiency and lower operating & support costs. \"We need 21 st century equipment if we're going to attack 21 st century threats. This is part of that,\" said Senator Tester.\nU.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Breanna Christopher Volkmar\nAirmen at Malmstrom Air Force Base tell me they are excited to see the new helicopter and say training starts ASAP.\n\"So, we're pretty much starting up immediately next week, we're going to kind of jump into the systems knowledge of it. Later this month, we're going to be traveling down to Louisiana for a simulator. And after that, we should be coming back and immediately you'll see them flying around in the skies,\" said TSgt William Sines, a flight chief with the 550 th Helicopter Squadron.\nAccording to a fact sheet provided the Air Force, the Grey Wolf's lower operating costs, increased reliability & improved maintainability translate into more than $1B in savings for the Air Force across the aircraft’s life cycle.\nBoeing’s MH-139A meets or exceeds all U.S. Air Force requirements at the most affordable price by reducing the cost and manpower required to operate and maintain the aircraft.\n\"I want the American people to know that the Airmen in Montana, whether they are out in the missile field operating or maintaining them or flying the Grey Wolf helicopter, are preforming for them the most important mission in our nation,\" said Gen. Bussiere.",
