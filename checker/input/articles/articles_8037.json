    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says.\nThe church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.\nMiller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C.\n\"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.\nThe covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said.\n\"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\"\nChief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing.\nCasimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\"\n\"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said.\nThe nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.\nSince then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996.\nIn many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death.\nThe children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse.\nThe agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school.\nCasimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "title": "Sen. Winnie Brinks reflects on historic 2023, looks ahead to 2024",
    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — For the first time in 40 years, Democrats held the majority in the state legislature in 2023. While that was historic in itself, it was just the beginning. Taking advantage of the majority, Democratic lawmakers were able to pass a number of legislative priorities, including a clean energy package, gun control, and expansions to reproductive rights. With those near the top, it's no wonder that when you ask Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-29) what accomplishment stands out to her, she has a hard time choosing. \"It's like picking a favorite child, and I can't do that either,\" says Brinks. But the first thing she does mention, is the historic 'Clean Energy & Jobs Act' saying this legislation has set Michigan on a path to lead not just the Midwest, but also in the nation.\" One key piece of the package, establishes a 100% clean energy standard for Michigan by 2040. \"Essentially, that just gets us away from fossil fuels, toward more sustainable methods of getting our energy,\" explains Sen. Brinks Another point of pride for the Grand Rapids Senator was passing [comprehensive gun control legislation](https://www.fox17online.com/news/whitmer-to-sign-gun-violence-prevention-bills-in-east-lansing-thursday). Sen. Brinks says extensive conversations began after the mass shooting at Michigan State, leading to safe storage laws, universal background checks, and extreme risk protection orders. Safe storage laws require that firearms in homes with children, be in a locked cabinet or safe. Over the last year, Grand Rapids Public Schools have had [five separate incidents](https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/grand-rapids/gun-pulled-from-student-at-ottawa-hills-high-school) of students bringing guns to school, and as Sen. Brinks puts it - it's these types of laws that could help cut down on dangerous incidents like students bringing guns to school, and accidental deaths. \"We see so many times when a child is is killed with a firearm, that it's an accident. It's a child who finds a weapon that hasn't been properly secured.\" But perhaps the most controversial policy change this year are the changes to abortion law and reproductive rights. In November of 2022, [Proposal 3 passed](https://www.fox17online.com/news/election-2022/proposal-3-passes-enshrining-abortion-rights-in-michigan-constitution) with about 57% of the vote, enshrining abortion rights into Michigan's Constitution. Building on that, the legislature repealed [Michigan's 1931 law](https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/whitmer-strikes-1931-abortion-ban-from-michigan-law) which banned abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. Plus, they later passed the [Reproductive Health Act](https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/michigan/governor-whitmer-repeals-1931-abortion-law-with-reproductive-health-act-signing), including repeals of the so-called \"rape insurance\", and another 1931 law that criminalized doctors and nurses for prescribing abortion medication. \"To make decisions that determine their future and to have control over those really intimate and important decisions in areas of their life, was just really, really important to us as a caucus,\" says Brinks. At the end of the day, Brinks says all of their efforts are not only about creating a future for families, but for that future to be right here in Michigan. \"Every day when we go to work, we're thinking about the people in our districts and making sure that we're looking out for those families, for those kids trying to create a life here, something that they can have hope in and really, really see themselves here in Michigan for the foreseeable future.\" Amid all of this historic policy-making, Senator Brinks herself is also making history as the first woman to be Senate Majority Leader in Michigan. But she's not alone, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-17) is the first openly gay man to serve as President Pro Tempore, and Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-21) is the first Black woman to chair the Appropriations Committee. Brinks says this kind of representation, helps bring diverse voices to the table as lawmakers shape future policies. It's this mindset of looking to the future, that Brinks says will continue on into next year. After adjourning in mid-November, the state legislature will be back in Lansing the second week of January. But after holding a two seat majority in the house for the last year, they will return to an even split. In this past November election, two state representatives won mayoral races on the east side of the state. Those seats will be open until a [special election in April](https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/michigan/governor-whitmer-requests-special-election-for-vacant-house-seats), but Sen. Brinks assures us that the their work will go on. \"You'll definitely see legislation move through committee and through the senate,\" explains Brinks. \"Some of those things will move through the house committees and wait for votes until April if they need to, to get the get the number of votes they need to pass. But we're confident we'll be able to get a lot of things done in that first quarter, even with what's going on in the house.\" The two open seats in the house are historically democratic, so come April, Brinks says they're confident Democrats will regain the full majority. But in the meantime, she's hoping for bipartisanship. They're currently working through new economic and community development legislation, bills to lower the price of prescription drugs, and they're also building on legislation passed this last session, including [financial disclosure laws](https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/michigan/gov-whitmer-signs-prop-1-into-law-increasing-government-transparency) approved by voters in Prop 1. \"I think there were some expectations that we would be able to solve more problems with this piece of legislation, then we could,\" says Brinks of the Proposal 1 laws, but she adds that what's been passed has established a solid foundation. In the vein of expanding transparency, one of the first things in the new senate session will be hearings on Freedom of Information Act legislation. Brinks says the goal is to make the business of the state legislature, the governor's office, and other executive departments more available to the public. \"It's important because people need to be able to trust that we are acting in their best interest, and right now, just simply not knowing causes a lot of doubt.\" Outside of that, Sen. Brinks also says there were a few pieces of legislation tied to the Reproductive Health Act that failed to get enough votes in the house, so she hopes to continue their work on expanding reproductive rights. Additionally, she says they're in the preliminary stages of looking at legislation regarding paid family leave. Watch the full interview with Sen. Brinks below: The state legislature will officially return to Lansing Wednesday, January 10.",

    "text": "任天堂在周三公布了备受期待的任天堂 Switch 2 游戏主机的新细节，这将是该公司自 2017 年推出任天堂 Switch 以来的首款新主机。\n　　任天堂 Switch 2 将于 6 月 5 日发售，售价 450 美元。\n　　在首发时，该主机将单独发售，也会作为包含《马里奥赛车世界》（Mario Kart World）的捆绑套装的一部分发售，《马里奥赛车世界》是一款为 Switch 2 打造的新游戏。\n　　 任天堂 Switch 2 会是什么样子呢？\n　　顾名思义，Switch 2 是任天堂 Switch 的升级版。它在现有的 Switch 设计基础上进行了改进，Switch 既可以在外出时游玩，也可以在家连接电视屏幕游玩。\n　　Switch 2 将是一个更大的主机，屏幕更大（尽管边缘仍有边框），Joy-Con 手柄更重，它们也会通过磁力吸附在屏幕两侧。该设备配备一块 1080p 的液晶屏幕，支持最高 120 帧每秒的帧率，还支持高动态范围（HDR）—— 这对于已经习惯了升级版 OLED 任天堂 Switch 的用户来说可能会有些失望。不过，底座将支持 4K 分辨率。\n　　任天堂 Switch 2 将拥有 256GB 的存储空间，是上一代的 8 倍，在上一代中，即使是休闲玩家通常也得购买一张 microSD 卡来获得更多存储空间。不过，它将只支持 microSD express 卡来扩展存储，这是一种新型的 microSD 卡。\n　　设备背面有一个更结实的支架，可以将设备直立放置。机身顶部和底部都有 USB-C 充电接口。（顶部似乎是为任天堂 Switch 摄像头准备的，但它也是一个位置更合适的充电接口。）\n　　任天堂 Switch 2 的经典配色是哑光黑色，每个 Joy-Con 手柄上分别有浅红色和蓝色的装饰，这呼应了之前的设计，但形式更加时尚。任天堂可能会让你购买任意数量、各种颜色的 Joy-Con 手柄 —— 希望这次不会再有摇杆漂移的问题。\n　　Joy-Con 手柄还可以在兼容的游戏中当作电脑鼠标使用。借助陀螺仪功能，玩家可以更好地控制体感操作。\n　　为了让用户熟悉新的任天堂 Switch 2 的功能，将会推出一款名为《欢迎之旅》（Welcome Tour）的游戏来介绍该设备，而且它是需要花钱购买的，这笔钱可能花在《马里奥赛车世界》上会更值。\n　　为了让这个交易更有吸引力，除了现有的任天堂 64 和 Game Boy 游戏移植版之外，任天堂在线服务现在还将允许玩家重温 GameCube 游戏，其中包括《火焰纹章：苍炎之轨迹》《超级马里奥前锋》《路易吉洋楼》《宝可梦 XD》等。一些游戏会在 Switch 2 发售当天推出，同时还会推出一款重新制作的 GameCube 手柄 —— 别担心，它带有 C 键。\n《马里奥赛车世界》/ 任天堂 　　 任天堂 Switch 2 上的 C 键是什么？\n　　很多粉丝猜测 Joy-Con 手柄上出现的 C 键的功能，任天堂今天证实它是 “游戏聊天”（GameChat）功能，该功能允许你在玩游戏时与朋友交流。\n　　系统中的麦克风可以识别你的声音，据说这样即使在嘈杂的房间里也能听到对方的声音。用户还可以在主机内分享自己的游戏屏幕，即使他们玩的是不同的游戏。（小心了，Discord。）不过，在演示中，另一位玩家的游戏屏幕画面看起来有点卡顿。\n　　右侧的 Joy-Con 手柄还有另一个 C 键，可以用于其他聊天功能，包括在你需要做其他事情时静音麦克风。\n　　“游戏聊天” 功能在 2026 年 3 月 31 日之前对所有用户免费开放，但在那之后，你需要有付费的在线会员才能使用。任天堂简要提到 “游戏聊天” 功能将提供家长控制，但没有提供更多细节。\n　　 任天堂 Switch 2 首发的硬件有哪些？\n　　任天堂发布了任天堂 Switch 摄像头，它可以连接到主机上，并将你的脸叠加在游戏画面上，非常适合 “游戏聊天” 功能。\n　　任天堂展示了一个使用该摄像头的例子，人们一起玩《马里奥派对》，玩家的脸会出现在他们角色旁边的对话框中，显示他们对游戏的反应。这些新功能将与某些游戏向后兼容，包括《马里奥派对大狂欢》。\n　　当然，还会有一款任天堂 Switch 2 Pro 手柄，它也包含新的 C 键。\n《大金刚狂欢》/ 任天堂 　　 任天堂 Switch 2 将有哪些可用的游戏？\n　　一开始，任天堂已经确认一款新的独占马里奥赛车游戏将与 Switch 2 在同一天发售，这款游戏名为《马里奥赛车世界》。\n　　《马里奥赛车世界》似乎是任天堂对开放世界马里奥游戏的诠释。游戏中有一个包含多个不同区域和赛道的大地图，而且在自由驾驶模式下，你可以随心所欲地驾驶 —— 无论是单人还是多人模式 —— 不用担心每个角落都潜伏着红色龟壳。\n　　Switch 2 将支持其他开发商的游戏，有些正在开发中，有些已经发布。这些游戏包括《哈迪斯 2》《艾尔登法环：褪色者版》《街头霸王》《EA Sports FC》《麦登橄榄球》《托尼霍克职业滑板 3+4》《如龙 0》《无主之地 4》《挺进地牢 2》《赛博朋克 2077：终极版》《最终幻想 7 重制版》《丝之歌》等。《三角符文》的新章节 3 和 4 将在 Switch 2 发售当天推出。\n　　还会有一款塞尔达系列的新游戏，名为《塞尔达无双：囚禁时代》（Hyrule Warriors： Age of Imprisonment），它是《塞尔达传说：王国之泪》的前传，预计今年冬天推出。\n　　星之卡比的粉丝们听到《星之卡比：空中骑手》（Kirby AirRiders）的消息会很高兴，这款游戏预计在 2025 年推出，它是对 20 年前原版 GameCube 游戏《星之卡比：空中滑车》的重制。新的 Switch 2 游戏《大金刚狂欢》（Donkey Kong Bananza）将于 2025 年 7 月 17 日发售。\n　　FromSoftware 公司的《暮血者》（The Duskbloods）正在为任天堂 Switch 2 开发中，将于 2026 年独家在该平台上发售。\n　　任天堂 Switch 2 将允许玩家为他们现有的 Switch 游戏购买升级，也可以为那些有特别的 Switch 2 版本的游戏购买升级，这些游戏包括《塞尔达传说：旷野之息》《塞尔达传说：王国之泪》《银河战士 Prime 4：超越》《宝可梦传说：Z-A》《星之卡比：探索发现》和《马里奥派对大狂欢》。不过，这些升级都需要付费。",

    "text": "Several US lawmakers, including three prominent Indian-American Congressmen, have strongly condemned the vandalism of a Hindu temple in California and asserted that those responsible for the act must be held accountable. The Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in Newark, California was vandalised with anti-India graffiti and the police are investigating the matter as a possible hate crime. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California's 17th Congressional District located in Silicon Valley, said in a post on X that he strongly condemns the “defacing” of the Swaminarayan temple in Newark, California which is in his district. “Freedom to worship is at the heart of American democracy. Those who committed this act of vandalism must be held accountable,” Khanna said. Hindu community come together to remove graffiti He said he is heartened that the community is coming together to stand up against hate and remove the graffiti. “This community action is answering wickedness with goodness,” he said. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi termed the defacing of the Swaminarayan temple as “despicable” and said he strongly condemns it. Krishnamoorthi, the US representative for Illinois's 8th congressional district, said he is glad the community is rallying in support of the mandir. “We must stand united against bigotry in all its ugly forms. Those who did this vandalism must be held accountable,” he said. Congressman Shri Thanedar also expressed his profound condemnation of the \"disgraceful act of vandalism\". \"This desecration, marked by anti-India graffiti, strikes at the very essence of our diverse and inclusive society. I denounce such attacks of intolerance and call for a thorough investigation into this heinous crime,\" Thanedar, the US representative from Michigan's 13th congressional district, said. \"Religious freedom and communal harmony are fundamental tenets of our nation, and I urge swift action by law enforcement to bring the perpetrators to justice, ensuring the safety and sanctity of all places of worship,\" he added. US State Department also condemned the vandalism Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California “unequivocally” condemned the attack. “Hatred in all forms cannot be tolerated. Those responsible must be held accountable,” she said. State Senator in the Ohio Senate Niraj Antani, elected to the Ohio Senate at age 29 and the youngest currently serving member of the Senate, said that as the first Hindu-American State Senator in Ohio history, he condemns in the \"strongest terms” the vandalisation of the Hindu Mandir. “The perpetrators must be caught and punished to the full extent of the law. We must root out and vanquish Hinduphobia everywhere it is,” Antani said. The US State Department on Saturday also condemned the vandalism at the temple and welcomed efforts by the police to ensure those responsible are held accountable. \"We condemn the vandalism of Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in California. We welcome efforts by the Newark Police Department to ensure that those responsible are held accountable,\" the US State Department's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said in a post on X Saturday. The City of Newark Police Department in Newark, Newark, California had told PTI in an emailed statement that on Friday at approximately 8:35 am, Newark Police received a report of graffiti at the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple. Officers responded and met with temple leaders who described the vandalism as meant to intimidate them. “Based on the content of the graffiti it is believed that the defacement was a targeted act, and the vandalism is being investigated as a possible hate crime,” the statement said. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco strongly condemned the defacing of the temple. “We strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti,” the Consulate posted on X. “This incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in this matter,” the Consulate said. Photos and videos go viral According to images posted on social media, the word ‘Khalistan’ was spray-painted on a signpost outside the temple along with other objectionable graffiti. Newark police further said that any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority. “Officers are investigating, collecting evidence, and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses to establish the chain of events and bring those responsible to justice,” the police said. The department said that “we stand united with our community and are urging community members with any information regarding this incident to come forward and speak with investigators.” The police are asking anyone with information regarding this investigation to contact the Newark Police Investigations Unit.

    "text": "原标题：爆料：美国秘密在芯片货物中安了追踪器\n据环球时报8月13日消息，最近，国家网信办就美国英伟达算力芯片漏洞后门安全风险约谈该公司问题受到关注。与此同时，越来越多美国给芯片安“后门”的内幕也被曝光。\n8月13日，路透社又刊发独家报道爆料，美国秘密在人工智能相关芯片中设置追踪器，以发现“芯片被转运至中国的情况”。\n路透社报道截图\n报道称，据两位知情人士透露，美国政府已秘密在他们认为有可能被转运至中国的先进芯片目标货物中植入位置追踪装置。知情人士称，这些措施“仅适用于部分受调查的货件”。追踪器可为美方搜集个人或机构违反出口管制的信息。\n位置追踪器是美国执法机构数十年来一直使用的一种调查工具，用于追踪受出口限制的产品，例如飞机零部件。\n另外五名人工智能服务器供应链相关人士表示，他们知道戴尔和超微 (Super Micro）的服务器货物中使用了这些追踪器，这些服务器中包含英伟达和AMD公司的芯片。这些人表示，追踪器通常隐藏在服务器的产品包装中。\n两名参与服务器供应链的人士描述，2024年的一个案例中，一批搭载英伟达芯片的戴尔服务器不仅运输箱上装有大型追踪器，还在包装内甚至服务器内部隐藏了更小、更隐蔽的追踪装置。\n消息人士称，负责监督出口管制和执法的美国商务部工业与安全局通常参与这类行动中，另外联邦调查局（FBI）等部门也可能参与其中。\n对于美国限制对华出口先进人工智能芯片相关问题，中国外交部发言人林剑11日表示，中方反对将科技和经贸问题政治化、工具化、武器化，反对对中国进行恶意封锁和打压的立场是一贯、明确的。这种做法扰乱全球产供链稳定，不符合任何一方利益。",

    "text": "Una parte degli utenti di Google Messaggi sta affrontando a un problema piuttosto fastidioso. L’applicazione, infatti, si chiude improvvisamente pochi secondi dopo l’apertura. Rendendone impossibile il normale utilizzo. A tal proposito, è importante sottolineare che non si tratta però di un malfunzionamento che colpisce tutti indistintamente. Secondo quanto riportato da 9to5Google, le segnalazioni non sono ancora numerosissime. Anche se risultano abbastanza diffuse. Il difetto sembra concentrarsi in particolare su una versione ben precisa: l’ultima beta identificata come 20250805_00_RC00. Chi utilizza la release stabile, o una beta precedente, pare non riscontrare alcun crash. Per tali utenti è possibile continuare ad usare l’app senza alcun intoppo.\nGoogle Messaggi: cosa c’è che non funziona?\nNon è la prima volta che l’app presenta un problema di tal tipo. Già a giugno, una versione beta aveva mostrato un malfunzionamento simile. In quel caso, però, il crash non avveniva all’avvio dell’app, ma nel momento in cui si selezionavano i destinatari di un messaggio. L’attuale anomalia, invece, si manifesta subito dopo l’apertura. Problema che finisce per bloccare qualsiasi possibilità di interagire con l’interfaccia principale. Nel frattempo, è utile sottolineare che, anche considerando il crash, gli utenti colpiti possono comunque rispondere ai messaggi. Per farlo, basta sfruttare le cosiddette “chat a bolla”. Ovvero le finestre pop-up che compaiono sullo schermo. Dettaglio che fa ipotizzare che il problema riguarda la schermata principale di Google Messaggi.\nAlcuni utenti stanno testando possibili rimedi. A tal proposito, in molti hanno dichiarato che disinstallando gli aggiornamenti dell’app il problema sembra essere rientrato. In tal modo, infatti, si torna alla versione fornita di default sul dispositivo. Per effettuare tale passaggio basta aprire la scheda delle informazioni di Google Messaggi, accedere al menu a tre puntini e scegliere l’opzione “Disinstalla aggiornamenti”. Si tratta ovviamente di una soluzione temporanea. Per ottenere una risoluzione definitiva non resta che attendere un intervento ufficiale da parte dell’azienda di Mountain View.",
