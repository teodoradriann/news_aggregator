    "text": "Rumen Radev President Rumen Radev didn’t settle for the proposal of the Council of Ministers to guide the Bulgarian delegation and take part within the assembly of the heads of state and authorities in Washington. This was introduced by the press workplace of the top of state. He refuses to be a pacesetter, because the workplace provided him, due to commitments that our nation will make relating to the battle in Ukraine. The latter is recorded within the Bulgarian place adopted by the cupboard.\nThe Head of State and Supreme Commander-in-Chief has at all times insisted and labored for the modernization of the Armed Forces, for rising the nationwide protection capability, for strengthening Bulgaria’s contribution to strengthening the deterrent and protection potential of NATO’s jap flank.\nFrom the primary day of the battle in Ukraine, the top of state strongly condemned the Russian aggression. At nationwide and worldwide boards, President Radev has at all times supported all components of the collective method to guaranteeing safety, rising protection capabilities, implementing the Alliance’s regional plans and rising protection assets, the press workplace added.\nOn the similar time, President Radev doesn’t settle for some provisions of the framework positions adopted by the Council of Ministers, regarding commitments that our nation undertakes relating to the battle in Ukraine. And on this regard, the top of state doesn’t settle for the proposal of the Council of Ministers to guide the Bulgarian delegation.\nYesterday, the Council of Ministers accredited Bulgaria’s framework positions for the NATO summit, which is able to happen on July Sept. 11 in Washington. With the identical choice, President Rumen Radev is proposed to guide the Bulgarian delegation, to current the accepted framework positions and, on their foundation, “to approve and/or affirm” the paperwork introduced on the assembly. The delegation additionally consists of the Prime Minister and Minister of Overseas Affairs Dimitar Glavchev, the press workplace recalled.\nOn June 21, the federal government data service introduced that appearing Prime Minister and Minister of Overseas Affairs Dimitar Glavchev, in addition to President Rumen Radev, will take part within the upcoming NATO Summit, which is able to happen from July 9 to 11 in Washington.\n#Radev #refused #lead #delegation #NATO",

However, an international photo agency raised concerns that the photo had been digitally manipulated and withdrew it, sparking a heated controversy.\nKate took responsibility and apologized, saying it was an “experiment” with photo editing.

    "title": "Watch: Blue whale nursing calf is captured on film for the first time",
    "text": "The first-ever video of a blue whale nursing her calf has been released, along with other stunning videos of the species' intimate interactions, which were captured in 2022 by a snorkeler in the right place at the right time. It's also the first time scientists and the wider community has seen these behaviors by these famously elusive cetaceans. These momentous few seconds filmed in the waters off the coast of Timor-Leste, came about as part of a decade-long research program between citizen scientists and researchers headed by the Australian National University (ANU). “Our decade-long project has documented some of the lesser-known intimate reproductive behaviors of blue whales, some for the very first time. It’s very exciting,” said program leader and marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, an associate professor at ANU. “From newborn calves and nursing mothers to amorous adults in courtship, the waters of Timor-Leste really are providing blue whale scientists with some of our first glimpses into the private lives of one of the world’s largest but most elusive animals.” Drone footage gathered as part of the program's monitoring in 2023 also captured two adult whales \"engaged in intimate courtship,\" revealing to the researchers that these waters play an important role in mating and reproduction. It also spotted whales defecating, providing concrete evidence that the animals also use these waters for foraging and feeding. These insights are invaluable for scientists, filling in vital knowledge gaps as to how these elusive whales interact with their environment. In 2008, research by Edyvane and colleagues highlighted the waters off Timor-Leste as a global hotspot and major migration corridor for whales and dolphins. The pygmy blue whales in the footage were part of an annual migration of the species, which sees them travel between southern Australia and the Banda Sea, east of Indonesia and just north of Timor-Liste. “Timor-Leste’s deep, nearshore waters, particularly in the narrow Ombai-Wetar Strait along the north coast of the country, provide one of the most accessible and best locations for blue whale research in the world,” said Edyvane. “Since 2014, our program has sighted over 2,700 blue whales in Timor-Leste’s waters, monitoring their annual migration along the country’s north coast. On a global level, these numbers are truly extraordinary.” These numbers deliver some rare good news in the cetacean world, where human impact disturbance – from commercial fishing to mining and industry – has devastated nearly all populations across every species. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) are endangered, with current estimates of between 10,000 and 25,000 individuals remaining in the world's oceans, with only 5,000 to 15,000 of those having reached maturity (and reproductive age). “This evidence suggests that these waters are not only important foraging areas for blue whales, but also are critical for reproduction,\" said Elanor Bell, a researcher at the Australian Antarctic Division. \"Until now, it has been a mystery when, where and how blue whales reproduce.” The latest insights are of the subspecies, the pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda), which grows to a maximum 79 ft (24 m) compared to the blue whale's 98 ft (30 m). While hardly small at 79 ft, the pygmy blue whales have been incredibly hard for scientists to track via tagging, because they move through the water so swiftly and only surface briefly before diving deep again for 15-20 minutes. As such, the blue whale monitoring program – known as Baleia no Golfinhu iha Timor-Leste – which involves both professional and citizen scientists, is proving crucial for research into the behaviors of these animals and for monitoring populations for any changes due to environmental factors. “The program has really developed and grown into a major collaboration between researchers, whale tour operators and tourists, student volunteers and local fishermen – all sharing information, images and observations about blue whale sightings,\" said research partner Jose Quintas, National Director for Environment and Research at the Timor-Leste Ministry of Tourism. \"They’ve shared with us some amazing blue whale images. It’s really been an exciting and shared journey.\" Naturally, it's a work in progress, like much ecological research – but made that much more difficult because of the nature of migration and the many territories the whales traverse in their annual journey. “But now, we really need to use this valuable new information to ensure we fully protect and conserve these animals when they pass through Timor-Leste’s waters and beyond,\" Quintas added. \"For this, we urgently need cooperation and support from Australia and the wider international community.” And just because we can't get enough of these videos, here's one more stunning drone clip above a mature blue whale. This research was presented for the first time to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in April.",

    "text": "When a 4-year-old boy who was born with lung problems wrote to Santa asking for a “big boy\" bicycle to help build up his breathing capacity, Whitfield County firefighters were moved. It was one of dozens of letters received during their first Letters to Santa Project, co-founded by the Whitfield Firefighters Charitable Fund and the Whitfield Professional Fire Fighters Association.\n“Last year, some of our fire stations decorated for Christmas in what ended up being called Operation Reindeer Games,” said Wesley Williams, president of the charitable fund. “So this year we decided to (join) with our professional firefighters and had some mailboxes built for all 12 of our fire stations. Stationery for the letters was printed, and it was so children would have a safe, secure place that their parents could bring them during the Christmas season to mail their letters to Santa.”\nHe described the dual organizations’ efforts as a way to “give back to the community and spread some Christmas cheer.”\n“Originally the goal was to pick 36 children to be able to provide a gift for, and what that was equated to was each station and each (eight-hour) shift would get one kid to be able to take a gift to,” Williams explained. “Thankfully, we were able to fundraise really well with the help of some of our corporate sponsors and actually bought multiple gifts for over 150 kids in our first year.”\nHowever, he added, the eventual outreach of the project will likely be closer to 200 children thanks to numerous corporate and business sponsors.\n“They really helped us out, and we wouldn’t have been able to do that without them,” added Williams. “We also sold some Christmas-designed T-shirts for the Letters to Santa Project.”\nA variety of requests He was asked about some of the more interesting letters.\n“A pretty common item we got was a request for a four-wheeler,” Williams replied. “Another kid asked for $110,000 for his family, which was a very specific request I thought was odd. We’ve had a lot of requests for pets, specifically cats. We were actually able to partner with Whitfield County Animal Shelter and fill one of those requests for a cat. They vetted it and made sure it was spayed before it was re-homed. (The shelter) is actually still looking for a few (pets) for people that are willing to wait till after Christmas.”\nIt was the 4-year-old boy’s letter that was “really, really impactful.”\n“He wrote the letter himself, and his mother made an attachment to it telling us about how he had some health problems when he was born,” began Williams. “He spent six months in the hospital at birth and lost part of one of his lungs on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation lung machine), and one of the things he asked Santa for at Christmas was a ‘big boy’ bicycle. Because he’s been working on his balance and building (up) his breathing so he doesn’t get out of breath when he does stuff.”\nStation No. 2 in Varnell got to fill the request.\n“I reached out to his mother the other day and talked to her, and they’re going to take him a bicycle and a helmet,” Williams said. “We’ve got him some Batman toys because that was his favorite (character). So when you start reading those letters, one like that really pulls on your heartstrings. That was one of the ones where we said, ‘We’re going to take care of that little boy.’”\nA Facebook post from the Whitfield Professional Fire Fighters Association page gives a parent’s response to Letters to Santa:\n“Our boys participated in the Letters for Santa at our local Fire Station No. 2 and were selected. Our firefighters, (who are) also Santa’s helpers, came out to special deliver Christmas magic and presents! The boys couldn’t believe their eyes and were so excited! We are very thankful for everything you all did and continue to do, (and) especially for keeping our community safe and delivering amazing memories!\n“P.S. — Station No. 2 has the best Christmas decorations!”\nSponsors of the Letters to Santa Project included MFG Chemical LLC, Textile Rubber & Chemical Co., Innovative Risk Services, Dalton-Whitfield Mechanical, WGB Industrial Sales, Tate Hauling (Amber Stephens Tate), Ford of Dalton, Shaw Floors, North Georgia Toyota, Nelson Tractor Co., Manly Steel, Professional Testing Laboratory Inc., Creative Metal Cuts and the Dalton Print Shop.\nReact to this story: Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n(0 Ratings) Tags Santa Claus Firefighter Trending Video Featured Local Savings NEWSPAPER ADS Trending Recipes Obituaries Burns Jr., John Youngblood, Lester McDonald, Clarice Richards, Patsy \"Pat\" Ruth Taylor Roman, Emily Todd, Johnson Hall, Robert More Obituaries Most Popular Articles Images Videos Commented Articles Greene explains vote on budget bill Carol's Fashions, Big Lots to close UPDATED: Dalton High has its new head football coach Southeast Whitfield High School principal resigns following allegations of 'misconduct' Pierce sworn in as Whitfield County sheriff, takes office Jan. 1 'Really grateful': Dalton man happy to spend first Christmas in new home Dalton High School close to naming football coach Area Arrests for Dec. 21/22 Area Arrests for Dec. 24/25 Prewett sees Dalton High head coach position as 'big-time opportunity' Images Videos Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.\nCommented Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.\nGet Breaking News Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.\nSign-up",

    "text": "Following the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton on Florida’s coast, the state’s property insurance market has shown resilience, aided by recent reforms. Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworsky shared positive updates, highlighting new insurers entering the market and rate reductions affecting millions of homeowners. Major insurers like Progressive and State Farm continue to expand their presence, and USAA reaffirmed its commitment to the state, encouraged by legislative reforms from 2023 that aim to create a more stable insurance environment. Recent developments include the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) receiving rate reduction filings from 15 companies, impacting 1.5 million residential policies in 2024. Additionally, 29 companies filed for a zero percent increase on nearly 2 million policies. The average homeowners’ rate request has significantly decreased, further supported by lower reinsurance costs and increased participation in the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation’s Depopulation Program. This growth has led to a $15 billion reduction in exposure for Citizens, while the reinsurance costs for Florida carriers have also dropped by 0.7%. The OIR remains committed to overseeing insurer conduct and ensuring compliance with state regulations, protecting consumers from unfair practices and emphasizing good faith during claims processes. The state’s regulatory efforts resulted in $8 million in monetary restitution for consumers in the 2023-24 fiscal year.",
