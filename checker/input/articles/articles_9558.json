    "title": "Hamas considering latest Gaza truce offer in ‘positive spirit’",
    "text": "GAZA STRIP: Hamas says it is considering in a “positive spirit” a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II. After months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached – even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah on Friday. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will “soon” send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that “realises the demands of our people”. Hamas official insists Gaza ceasefire must be permanent Haniyeh, the leader of the militant group’s political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a “positive spirit”. The stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war. “The scale of the destruction is huge and unprecedented… this is a mission that the global community has not dealt with since World War II,” Abdallah al-Dardari, the UNDP’s Regional Director for Arab States told a briefing in Jordan. The UNDP assessment forecast the socioeconomic toll inflicted will cost generations of Palestinians to come and called for an urgent ceasefire. ‘Suffering’ The only truce mediators have been able to hammer out so far was a week-long deal in November, that saw the release of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel estimates that 129 captives seized by the militants during their October 7 attack remain in Gaza. The military says 35 of them are dead, including 49-year-old Dror Or. The government confirmed Or’s death early Friday. Two of his children were among the hostages released during the November truce. Hamas and Israel have been at loggerheads for months over the terms of any new deal. The militant group has demanded a permanent ceasefire to end the war and the withdrawal of troops, which Israel has refused. While Israel faces regular protests demanding the government bring home remaining captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight on. Joe Biden says ‘order must prevail’ on US campuses amid protests With or without a truce, he has said he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite global concerns over the fate of around 1.5 million civilians sheltering there. The truce offer under consideration includes a 40-day halt to fighting and the exchange of Israeli hostages for potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain. During his latest whirlwind visit to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian group to accept what he termed an “extraordinarily generous” deal on the part of Israel. “If Hamas actually purports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal,” Blinken told reporters Wednesday. Until Haniyeh’s comments, Gaza-rulers Hamas had indicated a generally negative reception of the proposed truce. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. UNDP estimated that as of April 12, at least five percent of Gaza’s population had been killed or injured. Hamas delegation to visit Egypt soon for further ceasefire talks “The suffering in Gaza will not end when the war does,” UNDP chief Achim Steiner said. “Unprecedented levels of human losses, capital destruction, and the steep rise in poverty in such a short period of time will precipitate a serious development crisis,” he added. ‘Mouths left hungry’ The humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza have prompted demonstrations around the world, including in universities in the United States, Canada and France. Israeli President Isaac Herzog slammed the protests, charging that the US universities had been “contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism”. Colombia severed diplomatic ties with Israel on Wednesday, while Turkey on Thursday announced it was suspending trade. Gaza’s 2.4 million inhabitants are threatened by famine, but international aid has only been able to trickle in. Under US pressure, Israel has allowed increased aid deliveries in recent days, including through a reopened border crossing. At south Gaza’s largest hospital, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, which was heavily damaged by fighting in February, foreign aid and borrowed equipment has helped to “almost completely” restore the emergency department, its director Atef al-Hout said. US charity World Central Kitchen resumed delivering food to starving Gazans this week, after it had suspended operations following an Israeli strike in April that killed seven of its staffers. “We realised after the kitchen closed that many mouths were left hungry,” kitchen manager Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik said, while preparing food in Rafah.",

    "text": "\n7-Eleven is lying to you about the Japanese Egg Salad sandwich coming to America - Boing Boing\n…\ndon’t think I could ever buy egg salad from a gas station. Love the Japanese style white bread though and it’s perfect for BLT’s, grilled cheese, pb&j not just egg salad sandwiches. Though I’m a freak and the only mayo I buy is miracle whip. Next time I make egg salad I’ll have to try blending the yolks and mayo though.\nWhat the hell is this guy talking about? Those are the exact same egg salad sandwiches 7-Eleven has been selling in the United States for many, many years. They’re not new and as far as I can tell are not even claiming to be the same as the Japanese ones.\nyum yum\nThat photo is wonderfully odd. Thank you for sharing it.\nI was worried maybe i found it around these forums recently, but maybe not. unfortunately it seems to be the product of AI, but since that energy is already burned we may as well enjoy it.\nOn topic: i find egg salad repulsive, whether cheap or gourmet. No issue with any of the ingredients themselves, but just something about them all together like this an unholy marriage!\nIn related news, Canadian / Quebecois convenience store chain\nAlimentation Couche-Tard made a preliminary offer to purchase 7-Eleven. Couche-Tard also owns Circle-K and a number of other convenience store chains worldwide.\nI will say in my university days in Montreal, Couche-Tard was a cut above the average convenience store. Nowhere near a Japanese 7-Eleven, but better than the North American average. They recently purchased / rebranded a number of stores in AK - I’ll have to check out the Circle-K shops and will prepare myself to be disappointed if they’re anywhere near what they were previously.\nThat is pretty convincing AI, I wonder how detailed the prompt was?\nI could be wrong, but the “EGGG SALAD SANDWICH” text on the machine is a little bit of a tip off.\nSppeeellling is not my strog pint.\nYou had me convinced at ‘7-Eleven is lying’…\nYou did.\nAhh yes, “Odd Stuff,” the ultimate miscellany. Post edited with attribution.\nCongratulations citizen on another successful round of Egg Salad Surgery.\n7-11 is miserable now. To get the ‘real’ Tamago Sando you probably need the membership app.\nthe enshitification continues apace!\nI’m sorry, but crustless white bread and egg salad with sugar sounds disgusting. I’d be totally willing to give it a fair shot, but I’m guessing the Japanese sandwiches are for a certain palate.\nGiven the way the younglings use the word literally these days, does this mean he literally doesn’t have any egg salad sando merch?",

    "title": "SF City Attorney Sues Bayview Warehouse Owner for Allegedly Running Two Huge Illegal Marijuana Grows",
    "text": "Two Bayview warehouses have been acting as illegal indoor cannabis grows for over a year, according to a new lawsuit from City Attorney David Chiu, after state agents raided and found nearly 6,000 plants at the two facilities. You may not realize that there are [legal and fully complaint cannabis farms](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Warehouse-or-grow-house-Neighbors-can-t-tell-9137999.php) right here in San Francisco. These tend to be indoor grows at generic looking warehouses, so [ruthless cannabis thieves](https://sfist.com/2023/06/21/thieves-use-a-forklift-to-break-into-and-rob-oakland-cannabis-business/) can’t tell what’s really inside, and these legal facilities tend to be concentrated in the [Bayview, Dogpatch, and Potrero Hill warehouse districts](https://sfist.com/2023/06/21/thieves-use-a-forklift-to-break-into-and-rob-oakland-cannabis-business/). But a Thursday press release from SF City Attorney David Chiu says that two Bayview warehouses have been [acting as illegal indoor cannabis grows](https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2024/10/24/city-attorney-clamps-down-on-illegal-cannabis-grow-houses-that-undermine-legal-cannabis-market/) for at least a year and a half. And he can be confident of this. A pair of 2023 raids on these properties by the California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) yielded 5,817 cannabis plants, and 300 pounds of “shake,” the leafier, non-bud parts of the plants popular for use in pre-roll joints. “With thousands of illegal plants seized, the scale of this operation harms all the legitimate cannabis businesses,” Chiu said in that press release. “Our legal cannabis merchants are following the rules, paying taxes, providing safe products, and supporting our local economy. These property owners assisted their tenants in breaking the rules to make a profit. These illegal grow houses were rife with building code violations and fire safety issues, demonstrating why our cannabis regulatory system is so important.\" One of these warehouses is seen above, at 1355 Fitzgerald Avenue. That Google Street View photo was taken in May 2022, so we don’t know whether weed was being grown there at the time. (And honestly, the door to the place is being kept wide open in the photo.) But according to [Chiu’s full lawsuit](https://www.sfcityattorney.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-23-Complaint-File-Endorsed.pdf), the place was raided on October 25, 2023, and DCC agents found more than 3,500 plants. The owner of the building is PAA Property, whose president and manager is David Chi-Yu Lai. According to the lawsuit, “Lai was interviewed by DCC. He initially claimed to know nothing about the cannabis cultivation at 1355 Fitzgerald Avenue. After he was confronted with surveillance photographs showing him entering the warehouse, he admitted to knowing about the cultivation operation. He also admitted to knowing about the cannabis cultivation at 1510 Wallace Avenue.” As far as 1510 Wallace Avenue goes, the lawsuit says that on May 17, 2023, “an investigator noted the odor of cannabis while they were standing next to 1510 Wallace Ave. On May 23, 2023, DCC Det. Dennis Prizmich smelled cannabis when the property’s garage door was opened. Det. Prizmich noted an unusual level of security at the property.” Chiu’s lawsuit is not a criminal complaint, and just demands Lai and other defendants cease these activities, while levying penalties totaling $167,500. But it seems likely that Lai and the other defendants will face criminal charges from either San Francisco law enforcement or the state of California.

    "title": "California declara emergencia por gripe aviar. ¿Qué tan grave es la situación? - Los Angeles Times",
    "text": "Funcionarios de California han declarado un estado de emergencia debido a la propagación de la gripe aviar, que está afectando a las vacas lecheras en el estado y enfermando de manera esporádica a personas en Estados Unidos.\nEsto plantea nuevas preguntas sobre el virus, que se ha propagado durante años en aves silvestres, aves de corral y muchas especies de mamíferos.\nEl virus, también conocido como Tipo A H5N1, fue detectado por primera vez en el ganado lechero de Estados Unidos en marzo. Desde entonces, la gripe aviar ha sido confirmada en al menos 866 hatos en 16 estados.\nAnuncio Más de 60 personas en ocho estados han sido infectadas, la mayoría de las cuales presentaron cuadros leves, según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés). Una persona en Luisiana ha sido hospitalizada con el primer caso grave que se conozca causado por el virus, dijeron esta semana las autoridades sanitarias.\nEEUU\nEl gobernador Newsom declara emergencia en California luego de que los CDC confirmaran un caso grave de gripe aviar en Luisiana El miércoles, funcionarios de salud del condado de Los Ángeles confirmaron la muerte de dos gatos por infecciones de gripe aviar\nDic. 18, 2024 Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre la gripe aviar:\n¿Por qué California declaró estado de emergencia?\nEl gobernador Gavin Newsom dijo que declaró estado de emergencia para mejorar la posición del personal y los suministros estatales para responder al brote.\nCalifornia ha estado haciendo pruebas de detección de gripe aviar en grandes tanques de leche durante el procesamiento. Y han encontrado el virus en al menos 650 rebaños, lo cual representa unas tres cuartas partes de todos los rebaños lecheros afectados en Estados Unidos.\nEl virus fue detectado recientemente en granjas lecheras del sur de California después de haber sido detectado en el Valle Central del estado desde agosto.\nLa medida se toma “para garantizar que las agencias del gobierno tengan los recursos y la flexibilidad que necesitan para responder rápidamente a este brote”, dijo Newsom en un comunicado.\n¿Cuál es el riesgo para la ciudadanía en general?\nFuncionarios de los CDC enfatizaron nuevamente esta semana que el virus representa un bajo riesgo para el público general.\nEs importante subrayar que no hay reportes de transmisión de persona a persona y no hay señales de que el virus haya cambiado para propagarse más fácilmente entre humanos.\nEn general, los expertos en gripe estuvieron de acuerdo con esa evaluación, y dijeron que es demasiado pronto para decir cómo podría evolucionar el brote.\n“La respuesta completamente insatisfactoria va a ser: No creo que lo sepamos aún”, dijo Richard Webby, un experto en influenza del hospital St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\nPero los virólogos están en alerta porque los virus de la gripe están mutando constantemente, y pequeños cambios genéticos podrían alterar el panorama.\n¿Se están volviendo más graves los casos?\nEsta semana, funcionarios de salud confirmaron el primer caso conocido de una persona con síntomas graves en Estados Unidos. Todos los casos anteriores en el país —unos 60— fueron generalmente leves.\nEl paciente en Luisiana, que tiene más de 65 años y tenía problemas de salud subyacentes, se encuentra en condición crítica. Las autoridades han proporcionado pocos detalles, pero dijeron que la persona desarrolló síntomas respiratorios graves después de la exposición a aves enfermas en su corral de traspatio.\nEsto lo convierte en la primera infección confirmada en Estados Unidos vinculada a aves de traspatio, dijeron los CDC.\nLas pruebas mostraron que la cepa que causó la enfermedad de la persona es encontrada en aves silvestres, pero no en ganado vacuno. El mes pasado, funcionarios de salud en Canadá informaron que un adolescente en Columbia Británica fue hospitalizado con un caso grave de gripe aviar, también con la cepa del virus encontrada en aves silvestres.\nCasi todas los casos anteriores en Estados Unidos han sido de trabajadores agrícolas directamente expuestos a ganado lechero o aves de corral infectados. En dos casos —un adulto en Missouri y un niño en California— los funcionarios de salud no han determinado cómo lo contrajeron.\nEs posible que a medida que más personas se infecten, se presenten más casos graves, dijo Angela Rasmussen, una experta en virus de la Universidad de Saskatchewan en Canadá.\nEn todo el mundo, casi 1.000 casos de enfermedades causadas por H5N1 han sido reportados desde 2003, y más de la mitad de las personas infectadas han muerto, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).\n“Asumo que cada virus H5N1 tiene el potencial de ser muy grave y mortal”, dijo Rasmussen.\n¿Cómo pueden protegerse las personas?\nLas personas que tienen contacto con vacas lecheras o aves de corral comerciales o con aves de traspatio están en mayor riesgo y deben tomar medidas, entre ellas el uso de protección respiratoria y ocular, y guantes, dijeron los CDC y otros expertos.\n“Si las aves comienzan a parecer enfermas o mueren, deberían tener mucho cuidado con cómo manejan esos animales”, dijo Michael Osterholm, un experto en salud pública de la Universidad de Minnesota.\nLos CDC han pagado por vacunas contra la gripe para proteger a los trabajadores agrícolas contra la gripe estacional —y contra el riesgo de que puedan infectarse con dos tipos de gripe al mismo tiempo, lo que potencialmente permitiría que el virus de la gripe aviar mute y se vuelva más peligroso. El gobierno también dijo que los trabajadores agrícolas que entran en contacto cercano con animales infectados deben ser examinados y se les deben ofrecer medicamentos antivirales incluso si no muestran síntomas.\n¿De qué otra manera se está propagando la gripe aviar?\nAdemás del contacto directo con animales de granja y aves silvestres, el virus H5N1 puede propagarse en la leche cruda. La leche pasteurizada es segura para beber, porque el tratamiento mata al virus, según la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés).\nPero se han encontrado altos niveles del virus en leche no pasteurizada. Y la leche cruda vendida en tiendas en California fue retirada en semanas recientes después de que el virus fue detectado en granjas y en los productos.\nEn Los Ángeles, funcionarios del condado informaron que dos gatos domésticos que fueron alimentados con la leche cruda retirada murieron por infecciones de gripe aviar. Los funcionarios estaban investigando otros reportes de gatos enfermos.\nLos funcionarios de salud instan a las personas a evitar beber leche cruda, que puede contener otros gérmenes además de la gripe aviar.\nEl Departamento de Agricultura ha intensificado las pruebas a leche cruda en todo el país para ayudar a detectar y contener el brote. Una orden federal emitida este mes requiere pruebas, que comenzaron esta semana en 13 estados.\nEEUU Salud: Coronavirus",

    "text": "Jóvenes de Monterrey reportados como desaparecidos en Mazatlán son hallados sanos y salvos La pareja, había sido reportada como desaparecida durante su visita a Mazatlán el pasado fin de semana Sinaloa.- La pareja de jóvenes Lizbeth Carolina García Aguilar y Marco Alberto Rodríguez García, oriundos de [Monterrey ](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/2024/02/15/asesinan-a-tiros-a-adolescente-en-monterrey-en-pleno-dia/)y reportados como desaparecidos durante su visita a Mazatlán, han sido encontrados sanos y salvos. La noticia fue confirmada por Natalia García, hermana de Lizbeth Carolina, a través de las redes sociales. García señaló que, debido a la complejidad del caso, no pueden proporcionar detalles sobre lo sucedido hasta que las autoridades lo autoricen. Sin embargo, expresó su profundo agradecimiento por el apoyo recibido de familiares, amigos y desconocidos durante este difícil período. La desaparición de la pareja durante el pasado fin de semana llevó a la Fiscalía General de Nuevo León a solicitar la intervención de las autoridades judiciales estatales en su búsqueda. Sara Bruna Quiñonez Estrada, fiscal general de [Sinaloa](https://www.elimparcial.com/mxl/mexicali/2024/02/26/capturan-en-sinaloa-a-buscado-por-homicidio-en-mexicali/), reveló que recibió un oficio de colaboración el miércoles pasado para investigar el paradero de la pareja, quienes presuntamente abandonaron el hotel donde se hospedaban en la madrugada del sábado. Aparecen sanos y salvos Lizbeth Carolina García Aguilar y Marco Alberto Rodríguez García En declaraciones en redes sociales, la hermana de Lizbeth Carolina reveló que no habían tenido noticias de ella desde la madrugada del sábado, a pesar de que la pareja solo había viajado a Mazatlán por dos días debido a compromisos laborales de Marco Alberto. Según lo divulgado, el último contacto breve con Marco Alberto fue la mañana del domingo, cuando informó que estaban bien pero su teléfono se quedó sin batería y la llamada se cortó.

    "title": "Nuevo gold standard para la seguridad de los medicamentos durante la lactancia",
    "text": "Las mujeres que deciden interrumpir un tratamiento durante el embarazo y la lactancia ponen en peligro su salud, y tienen que sopesar su deseo de tener hijos y dar el pecho frente a un riesgo desconocido. En dos ensayos clínicos que se están desarrollando en la Universidad de Uppsala, los investigadores han establecido una nueva norma para los estudios sobre lactancia humana que incluye la toma de muestras de leche materna y plasma tanto de las madres como de los lactantes.\n\"La falta de pruebas científicas es un problema ético para las mujeres y los médicos, teniendo en cuenta que alrededor del 70% de las mujeres necesitan medicación en algún momento de su embarazo. En muchos casos, se recomienda a las mujeres que se abstengan de dar el pecho o dejen de tomar sus medicamentos. Sin embargo, la lactancia tiene beneficios tanto para la madre como para el niño\", afirma Mats G. Hansson, catedrático de ética biomédica del Centro de Ética de la Investigación y Bioética de la Universidad de Uppsala, responsable de dos ensayos clínicos en curso.\nEl 95% de los medicamentos no se han estudiado lo suficientemente bien como para incluir en la etiqueta información sobre su seguridad durante el embarazo y la lactancia. La norma actual para los estudios de lactancia utiliza datos de animales y concentraciones de medicamentos en la leche materna, mediante farmacocinética de base fisiológica para estimar qué cantidad de una sustancia concreta se transfiere al bebé. Los estudios que existen son antiguos y se basan en datos de muy pocos individuos, con métodos de análisis antiguos.\n“En muchos casos, se recomienda a las mujeres que se abstengan de dar el pecho o dejen de tomar sus medicamentos”\nLa revista BMJ Open acaba de publicar un protocolo para un nuevo gold standard de los estudios clínicos sobre lactancia, en el que se analiza la concentración de prednisolona en la leche materna y en el plasma de la madre y del lactante. La prednisolona se receta para varias afecciones, entre ellas la artritis reumatoide, una enfermedad crónica y debilitante que requiere tratamiento a largo plazo.\nLas muestras se almacenan en biobancos y se analizan en relación con las propiedades farmacocinéticas de los medicamentos y la transferencia de la leche materna al plasma del lactante. Los presentes estudios se centran en la prednisolona, utilizada en el tratamiento de la artritis reumatoide, y la metformina, empleada en el tratamiento de la diabetes de tipo 2. Con el biobanco y la obtención del consentimiento informado para futuras investigaciones, aún sin especificar, el protocolo se abre al seguimiento a largo plazo de los efectos de la medicación en los lactantes.\nLas mujeres son reclutadas a través de una red de centros clínicos de Suecia, y las muestras se almacenan para futuras investigaciones en una red de biobancos de leche materna gestionada por BBMRI-ERIC. Según Mats G. Hansson, esto garantiza que el estudio forme parte de una infraestructura europea más amplia, lo que posibilitará futuras investigaciones. El protocolo que acaba de publicarse se ha desarrollado en el marco de la gran colaboración europea ConcePTION, y describe cómo se recogen y analizan las muestras.\n*Los contenidos de ConSalud están elaborados por periodistas especializados en salud y avalados por un comité de expertos de primer nivel.

    "text": "Nearly 4,000 violent assaults were reported on trains in Britain in the past year, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show. The party called for “a serious strategy” to tackle crime on the railways as it accused the Conservatives of being “all bark and no bite”. British Transport Police (BTP) statistics show 3,991 incidents of violence against the person were reported on trains in the year to the end of November. That is up 12% from the previous 12 months. The figures also show 699 robberies were reported on trains in the year to the end of November, up 18% year on year, while sexual offences rose by 2.3% to 1,419. Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who obtained the data through a Freedom of Information request, said: “People deserve to feel safe when on public transport, yet these alarming figures tell a different story. “Far too often our train carriages are being turned into crime scenes as violent criminals are allowed to terrorise other passengers with impunity. “This Conservative Government is all bark and no bite. Rather than yet more rhetoric, we need a serious strategy to tackle this rise in crime on our railways. “The public deserves better – which is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for a return to local community policing which will help keep us safe.” BTP head of crime and public protection Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Furnell said: “Tackling crimes such as robbery and sexual offences are a force priority and we have dedicated taskforces as a result. “We are committed to making the network a hostile place for those who seek to commit such offences. “We are aware the data might not represent a true increase, with travel numbers only recently returning to pre-Covid levels. “Additionally, we continue to campaign to encourage victims and witnesses to report to us as a priority – particularly for sexual offences which we know are under-reported – and with this we expect the number of reports to continue to increase. “As a result of this, we continue our work to make reporting as accessible as possible for the travelling public, with our discreet text 61016 service turning 10 this year and the introduction of the free Railway Guardian app in 2022.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are providing police forces with the tools they need to deliver for the public and since 2010, our communities are safer. “Neighbourhood crimes including burglary, robbery and theft are down 50% and violent crime is down 52%. “There are also now 149,500 police officers keeping the public safe in England and Wales – the highest number on record.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "MÉRIDA, Yuc., 28 de diciembre de 2023.- A sus 11 años de edad, Víctor Gerardo Vázquez Basto, tiene una capacidad extraordinaria para los números y ha puesto en alto el nombre de Yucatán al ser galardonado con la medalla de oro de la séptima edición del Concurso Nacional de la Olimpiada Mexicana de Matemáticas de Educación Básica (OMMEB).\nEl alumno de sexto grado de la escuela primaria “Ricardo López Méndez”, de la colonia Emiliano Zapata Sur I, de Mérida, fue seleccionado entre 15 mil aspirantes yucatecos, siendo considerado como uno de los 9 estudiantes de primaria y secundaria, que se ubicaron en el ranking nacional al obtener ocho medallas; así como una mención honorífica por su destacado desempeño. A su decir, el mundo sin números sería muy aburrido.\nDesde pequeño me he sentido fascinado por las matemáticas, por eso cuando fui avanzando en las diferentes etapas y después cuando fui seleccionado nacional me dio mucha alegría y me siento muy orgulloso de haber formado parte de la delegación yucateca de alumnas y alumnos que pudimos destacar por nuestro trabajo en equipo, expresó acompañado de sus padres: María del Carmen Basto Segovia y Gerardo Yahir Vázquez Hernández, así como de sus hermanos: Eren Isaan Vázquez Basto y Mariam Giselle Vázquez Basto\nLo que más me gusta de las matemáticas es que las puedo encontrar en cualquier parte, desde lo más básico como las sumas y restas hasta las ecuaciones, coordenadas, así como la física y tecnología; me gusta asistir a las competencias y entrenamientos porque convivo y comparto MI pasión por las matemáticas con otros estudiantes con los mismos intereses, logrando un intercambio de conocimientos que nutren nuestro aprendizaje, agregó Víctor Gerardo.\nSobre sus aspiraciones a futuro compartió que le gustaría ser arquitecto, ingeniero o programador, ya que considera que las matemáticas son su pasión y quisiera vivir rodeado de ellas el resto de su vida. Resaltó que al pasar de los años ha descubierto nuevas habilidades para realizar cálculos mentales, mismos que ha puesto en práctica en cada una de las pruebas que ha realizado.\nEn este momento, se encuentra en proceso de selección para formar parte de los representantes de México en la IMC (International Mathematics Competition), el cual consiste en dos etapas virtuales de entrenamiento, y otras dos de manera presencial que se realizarán en diferentes partes de la República Mexicana, previo a la conformación del equipo final.\nDurante la séptima edición del concurso, de la que resultó ganador Víctor Gerardo, se realizó de manera virtual a finales del mes de septiembre del presente año, con la participación de 29 estados y 261 estudiantes. La delegación yucateca contó con el apoyo y respaldo de la Segey y de la Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY) quienes otorgaron el entrenamiento para mejorar su desempeño en los exámenes a nivel nacional.",

    "text": "John W. Danforth Company Initiative Shining Spotlight on Mental Health Awareness for Construction Workers\nBUFFALO, NY – As summer reaches its peak, construction workers can be feeling the heat in more ways than one. An industry leader is undertaking a special initiative to let workers know there is someplace to turn when they need it.\nJohn W. Danforth Company, one of the largest mechanical contractors in the northeast, rolled out a special program to shine a spotlight on mental health awareness for workers in the construction industry. The company worked with Buffalo’s 26 Shirts to create a custom T-shirt that is being distributed to team members across Danforth’s six office locations in New York, Ohio and Vermont. The back of the shirt is emblazoned with a graphic of an eagle wearing a hard hat at a construction site, with the words “Strength in Tough Times” above the graphic and “You Are Not Alone” below the graphic, along with information for the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\nAs part of the initiative, 26 Shirts will donate a portion of the proceeds from Danforth’s order to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n“For Danforth and across our entire industry, jobsite safety is paramount. Mental health is jobsite safety,” said Danforth CEO Robert Beck. “We wear equipment to protect our bodies, we check our tools, we inspect our harnesses—we need to check in on each other. Too many times, workers will try to tough it out in silence. We want them to know there are resources available if and when they need them.”\nContractors at Risk\nAccording to federal statistics, the construction industry has one of the highest rates of suicide, with rates four times higher than in the general population. Contributing factors include stress, long hours, and the potential seasonality of work, among others. Summer can be a particularly tough time.\n“Working in the heat and the elements can be very physically and mentally demanding. The days get longer and project schedules and deadlines can intensify,” said Mike Bement, Senior Vice President, Pre-Construction. “It is important for workers, in the field, in the shops, and in the office, to know that it’s okay not to be okay.”\nThe inspiration for Danforth’s mental health awareness initiative came from Beck’s tenure as national President of the Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA). He spent the majority of his one-year term traveling around the country meeting with other MCAA member companies and discussing important issues that are facing the mechanical contracting industry.\n“It was eye-opening to me to see and hear from contractors in every market across the United States what a real crisis our industry is facing in terms of suicide,” he said. “This isn’t just about Danforth. Construction is a brotherhood and sisterhood. If our project partners across our 750-mile footprint see our Danforth team members wearing the shirts, hopefully it will spur conversation, especially if someone is struggling. We’re all in this together.”\nNational Suicide Crisis Lifeline\nA leader in suicide prevention and mental health crisis care, the 988 National Suicide Crisis Lifeline has answered more than 13 million calls, texts and chats from people in need of support across the United States and its territories since its launch in July 2022.\nJohn W. Danforth Co.\nFounded in Buffalo in 1884, Danforth has more than 1,000 employees across a geographic footprint that includes its Western New York headquarters and operations in Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany, New York, Columbus, Ohio, and Burlington, Vermont. The company works collaboratively with its union labor partners including the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA), the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART), and several other labor partners across many local union jurisdictions throughout the northeast and beyond.\nFor more information visit jwdanforth.com.",
