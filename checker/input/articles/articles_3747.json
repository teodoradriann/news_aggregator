The judge in the case ruled in favor of the City of Elkhart, stating: \"A governmental entity is immune for a loss resulting from 'the act or omission of anyone other than the governmental entity or the governmental entity's employee.'\" The ruling states that since the city was not directly responsible for the three deaths, they are immune from prosecution. \"In sum, in their case-in-chief, Plaintiffs did not present any evidence from which reasonable jury could find Defendant City of Elkhart negligent, as the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries, nor any evidence to defeat statutory immunity. Therefore, Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to prove their claims of negligence by the greater weight of the evidence and this Court should enter judgment on the evidence in the City's favor,\" the ruling concluded. \"For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant judgment on the evidence in favor of Defendant City of Elkhart on all of Plaintiffs' claims.\"",

    "text": "Graded stakes-placed [Fingal’s Cave](https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Fingals_Cave_1) made a successful return to the races after a 432-day layoff to post a strong victory in Thursday’s $100,000 [Bay Ridge](https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2023_Bay_Ridge), a one-mile test for New York-bred fillies and mares 3 years old and up at Aqueduct. Trained by David Donk, the 4-year-old daughter of Carpe Diem had not raced since posting a deep-closing runner-up effort after a troubled start in the Grade 2 Raven Run last October at Keeneland, but she showed no signs of rust when coasting to a front-running victory over multiple graded stakes-placed Venti Valentine. [Aqueduct entries and results](https://entries.horseracingnation.com/entries-results/aqueduct). “432 (days)? I heard someone say the number and I tried not to dwell on it. As a trainer, boy could I have worked her a couple more times,” Donk said, with a laugh. “She’s got a lot of class, so I think the class prevails.” Guided to victory by Jose Lezcano, Fingal’s Cave broke evenly from post 2 in the field of six and steadily inched to the front exiting the chute to establish command over the sharp-starting Bustin Bay through an opening quarter-mile in 23.30 seconds over the muddy and sealed main track. Venti Valentine tracked between Fingal’s Cave and Bustin Bay down the backstretch before being asked to take up second position by jockey Manny Franco as Fingal’s Cave maintained her advantage and quickened to mark the half-mile in 46.52 seconds. Approaching the turn, Fingal’s Cave was met with the challenge from Venti Valentine as a patient Bustin Bay reengaged three wide under Kendrick Carmouche and was asked for her best. FINGAL'S CAVE wins the Bay Ridge Stakes impressively for David Donk with Jose Lezcano aboard!— NYRA (??) (@TheNYRA) [pic.twitter.com/vL3FyDTkQN] [December 28, 2023] Venti Valentine came under a strong ride from Franco in the turn with Bustin Bay attempting to rally in the three path, but Lezcano remained motionless aboard a loaded Fingal’s Cave into the stretch after three-quarters in 1:11.46. Lezcano shook his reins at the eighth pole and Fingal’s Cave responded with aplomb, drawing off strongly from Venti Valentine and pricking her ears just before crossing the wire 4 3/4 lengths in front in a final time of 1:37.45. Venti Valentine preserved place honors by 1 1/2 lengths over the late-running Cairo Sugar, who bested Bustin Bay by a neck. Know It All Audrey and Sweetie completed the order of finish. Sweet Mystery was scratched. Donk said he left race tactics in the capable hands of Lezcano. “I thought there would be more pace. I was satisfied that horses could close today and that it wasn’t a biased rail. Sometimes, when it gets wet and dries out, it changes throughout the day. But horses were closing,” Donk said. “I told him to ride her the way he thought was best. Jose is a really good rider and really kind. But she broke sharp and I thought being off the long layoff, she’d be a little fresh. I thought maybe one or two might be in front of her but when she was there, he did the right thing.” Lezcano, who was aboard for the first time in the afternoon, said Fingal’s Cave was highly professional. “When we broke out of the gate, my filly did everything herself,” Lezcano said. “She’s got a lot of class and broke pretty good and put herself there. I didn’t ask her for nothing. When I asked her at the quarter (pole) she went on and won the race. “When I got to the quarter, I still felt I had a lot left in the tank,” Lezcano continued. “When I asked her she went on well. I think she’s very classy.” The talented Fingal’s Cave has now won 5-of-6 lifetime starts, including an additional state-bred stakes triumph in the Fleet Indian last August at Saratoga Race Course. She earned $55,000 for her Bay Ridge triumph, boosting her total purse earnings to $370,500 while returning $6.20 on a $2 win ticket.",

    "title": "MRI Software: festive season relieves pressure on retailers as footfall surges +6.1% in December",
    "text": "Despite weather and rail disruptions, coupled with challenging economic conditions, December witnessed a surge in footfall of +6.1% from the month before in all UK retail destinations. This was predominantly boosted by the fourth week of the month, the final trading week before Christmas day, with footfall rising by +11.2% across all UK retail destinations.\nShopping centres led the charge with a rise in footfall of +11.1% in December from November followed by retail parks (+5.9%) and high streets (+3.7%). This is indicative of the diverse offerings of shopping centre destinations, from eating out to a multitude of retail brands, making them a preferred choice for consumers during the festive season.\nCompared to 2022, footfall rose marginally by +0.2% across all UK retail destinations, however this was largely driven by activity in high streets where footfall rose by +1.2% versus a modest rise of +0.1% in retail parks, whereas shopping centres witnessed a decline of -1.9%. This suggests that the investment made by many historic and market towns in festive events and attractions were worthwhile in driving footfall during the Golden Quarter.\nThe month of December witnessed an improvement in footfall performance from the 2019 level as it narrowed to -10.4% across all UK retail destination, which was the second best result recorded for the year following June’s result when it was -8.6% lower than 2019. In high streets this narrowed to -11.4% from -12.6% in the month before, shopping centres witnessed an improvement to -16.7% from -17.1% in November and retail parks also noticed this improve to -1.5% from -2.2% in the month prior.\nTHE MONTH OF DECEMBER BROKEN DOWN BY WEEK\nThe month began on a weak note, with footfall declining by an average of -0.8% in the first two weeks across all retail destinations from the week before, however this was much more noticeable in high streets where footfall dipped by an average of -2.6%. This was likely influenced by rail disruptions and poor weather deterring people from venturing out.\nHowever, as we approached the pivotal festive trading period footfall took an optimistic turn with the penultimate Christmas week (w/c 10th December) seeing footfall reach +6.5% and then growing to +11.2% in that all important last week before Christmas (w/c 17th December). This final week of Christmas trading was largely driven by activity in retail parks and shopping centres where footfall increased by +17.2% and +16.4%, respectively, from the week before as consumers made that last minute ‘dash’ for gifts and groceries. High streets also witnessed a surge in activity however this was much more noticeable in the penultimate trading week where footfall rose by +7.9% from the week before.\nBOXING DAY AND BEYOND\nThe week between Christmas and New Year tends to follow a historical trend of lower footfall from the week before. In 2023, Boxing Day footfall was +4% higher than Boxing Day 2022, primarily driven by high streets (+8.8%) whereas retail parks and shopping centres both experienced a year-on-year decline of -1%. Despite the increase, footfall on Boxing Day remained -14.9% lower than 2019 levels, indicating continued travel or the growing trend to use this day to shop online which may have even started as soon as Christmas Day.\nWith so many retailers and outlets going into ‘sale’ from Black Friday the opportunity for further reductions during Boxing Day and beyond is likely to have lessened, this coupled with ongoing tightening of spend as a result of increased cost of living could account for these lower footfall figures. Central London witnessed the most notable uplift in footfall year on year on Boxing Day (+10.6%) and observed a +1.6% rise in activity compared to 2019. Throughout the week, footfall levels continued to rise from 2022 levels across historic, market and coastal town types. Much of the rise witnessed in and around London was driven by activity in the West End (+7.6%), and Central London (+5.7%). This suggests that many are likely to have ventured out to make the most of the festive events and attractions, and other leisure reasons.\nLOOKING AHEAD TO JANUARY AND 2024\nAs we look ahead to January, a natural post-Christmas slump is anticipated, with footfall projected to decline in the region of -20% to -25%. Weather warnings and a one week delay in the return to school for many regions across the UK, may lead to subdued footfall at the start of the month. However, this should improve as the month progresses, compared to 2023 levels, particularly with more and more employees returning to offices. The financial constraints felt in the latter part of 2023 for many consumers are likely to continue into the early part of 2024 which may also impact footfall in UK retail destinations.",

We will never accept same sex couples in the Kenyan Church, with utmost and profound respect and reverence to the Pope,” he said. Anyolo Sunday defied the order by Pope Francis to bless the union of same-sex couples saying any such activity would be scandalous to the faith. In a statement to all Catholic churches under the Archdiocese of Nairobi, Archbishop Anyolo clarified that the declaration goes against the Word of God, the teaching of the Church and African Cultural Traditions. Pope Francis had suggested he would be open to having the Catholic Church bless same-sex couples adding however, that the Church still considered same-sex relationships “objectively sinful” and would not recognize same-sex marriage. “All Clergy residing and ministering in the Archdiocese of Nairobi are prohibited from blessing irregular relationships, unions, or same sex couples. Any form of blessing of same-sex unions and activities would go against God’s word, the teaching of the church,” he said. Archbishop Anyolo argued that the concept ‘blessings’ of same sex couple will be perceived as normalizing sin which the Church has no authority to do in the faithfulness of the Gospel and the Institution of marriage. “This Declaration confirms and reiterates the perennial teaching of the Church that marriage is to be affirmed as an “exclusive, stable and indissoluble union of a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children and that the Church does not have the power to impart blessings on unions of persons of the same sex,” said Anyolo’s statement in part. In the Catholic Church, a blessing is a prayer or plea, usually delivered by a minister, asking for God to look favourably on the person or people being blessed. The Catholic Archbishop explained that even though the ‘blessing’ would be done outside the liturgical rites it must be conformed within God’s will. This coming days after The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) moved to clarify the controversial decision by the Vatican allowing priests to bless same-sex unions saying it only allows ‘simple blessings’ outside the liturgical setting. The Kenyan bishops, responding to public concerns on the matter, said the move is meant to promote inclusion irrespective of the moral status of congregants. The bishops said the directive sanctioned by Pope Francis was part of efforts to expand the scope of pastoral blessings administered by the church. “This declaration does not in any way approve of “Same-sex Marriages” nor try to give a back-door recognition of such a union. It does not seek an alternative “union blessing” to substitute a Sacramental marriage,” said Most Rev Martin Kivuva, KCCB Chairperson, said. “What this document seeks is to awaken the invitation of all people to God’s action and grace. The Church seeks to reach out to all individuals in order to stir them to the path of conversion and salvation.” The Catholic Church came under heavy criticism for shifting from its earlier position after holding in 2021 that God “cannot bless sin”. Archbishop Kivuva went on to explain that the decision “does not change in any way the understanding of Marriage as a Sacrament in the Church, an indissoluble union between a man and a woman, for life.” Instead, the “Declaration remains firm on the traditional doctrine of the Church about marriage, not allowing any type of liturgical rite or blessing similar to a liturgical rite that can create confusion.”",

    "text": "LONDON: Oil prices fell around 1% on Thursday as concerns eased about shipping disruptions along the Red Sea route, even as tensions in the Middle East continue to fester.\nFront month February Brent crude futures were down 90 cents, about 1.1%, at $78.75 a barrel by 1141 GMT in subdued trade ahead of their imminent expiry, while the more active March contract was down 69 cents, about 0.9%, at $78.85 a barrel.\nU.S. WTI crude futures were trading 80 cents, or about 1.1%, lower at $73.31 a barrel. Oil prices dropped nearly 2% on Wednesday as major shipping firms began returning to the Red Sea.\nDenmark’s Maersk will route almost all container vessels sailing between Asia and Europe through the Suez Canal from now on while diverting only a handful around Africa, a Reuters breakdown of the group’s schedule showed on Thursday.\nMajor shipping companies, including container giants Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, stopped using Red Sea routes and the Suez Canal earlier this month after Yemen’s Houthi group began targeting vessels, disrupting global trade.\n Oil prices down as investors watch Red Sea developments\nHowever, a U.S.-led coalition to quell tensions in the Red Sea has not so far yielded coordinated action as hoped.\nA week after the launch of the maritime force, many allies do not want to be associated with it, partly reflecting the fissures created by the conflict in Gaza, which has seen the U.S. maintain firm support for Israel even as international criticism rises over its offensive.\nIsrael has escalated its ground war in Gaza sharply since just before Christmas, with Israel’s chief of staff Herzi Halevi telling reporters this week that the war would go on “for many months”.\nU.S. government data on fuel stockpiles is due on Thursday, delayed by a day due to the Christmas holiday on Monday.\nData from the American Petroleum Institute industry group on Wednesday showed crude stocks rose 1.84 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 22, against estimates from seven analysts polled by Reuters for a drop of 2.7 million barrels.\nMeanwhile, the growing prospect of interest rate cuts in Europe and the U.S. in 2024 are positive from an oil demand perspective.\n“The market is likely to try the upside again … maybe in the early new year, also on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States and higher kerosene demand during the winter in the northern hemisphere,” said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities.\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\nOil prices slide as Red Sea transport disruptions ease\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead ",
