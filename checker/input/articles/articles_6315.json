    "text": "GREECE, N.Y. – The Boys and Girls Club is expanding its programming to Greece, hoping to give 6th graders a new option for how they spend their time after school. The after-school program is open to any 6th grader at Greece Arcadia, free of charge. It’s funded with a five-year grant from the Boys and Girls Club and has been a bit of a passion project for the school’s principal.\nAt first, McKeegan Coyne wasn’t sure he’d be into it.\n“I was like a little nervous cause I’ve never done one of these before, I never stayed after school,” Coyne tells News10NBC.\nCoyne is a 6th grader at Arcadia and quickly got over his nerves. He now chooses to stay almost until closing time every night.\n“It’s introduced me and to new people…I think it’s really cool cause I can connect with more people, and more people can connect with me,” he says\nHis mom, Jamie Coyne, loves it.\n“The social aspect of it is amazing. He’s hanging out with kids that he might not normally hang out with during the day which I think is great for him, he’s like, ‘Yeah I made a new friend today,’ which is great,” she says.\nThe 6th graders start with homework and reading every day after school but after that, there’s gaming, sports, arts and crafts, relays, and then dinner.\n“We get a lot of parents who work until 5 o’clock and they don’t want their student to be home alone until that time and I don’t blame them,” says Cassidy Osborne, the program director.\nSixth grade is often a crucial year in a child’s development. They’ve just moved up from elementary school, they’re learning a lot about themselves and who they want to be and it’s crucial to have support and positive role models.\n“I think that if we give them a safe place that they can come and just hang out with their peers and they can get that physical activity and they can get all the things that they need instead of going out and hanging out in the streets or at random stores or anything like that if we’re giving them that space then that’s my main goal,” Osborne says.\nThe program runs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. every weeknight and the activities change daily.\n“We listen to the kids and whatever they want to do as long as it’s reasonable and we can make it happen, I’m going to make it happen,” Osborne says.\nIt’s already led to some grateful students and parents.\n“He’s a kid I never thought would do clubs, he’s like, ‘No I gotta get home, I gotta hang out with my friends, I gotta be on electronics.’ He’s now stayed after school every single day this week and he’s doing e-sports twice a week, this has been the most amazing transition for him and it’s been great,” Jamie Coyne says.\nThere’s still room in the program for other 6th graders at Greece Arcadia. Eventually, the district and the Boys and Girls Club are hoping to expand the program to other middle schools and beyond 6 th grade.\n*A.I. assisted with the formatting of this story.

    "text": "台中環保局馳援嘉義縣災後復原 民眾感佩援助同心走過災後時刻\n民生電子報/\n1 小時前\n記者馬源培／台中報導\n台中市政府環保局「台中隊」昨(9)日持續挺進嘉義縣災區協助丹娜絲颱風災後復原工作，連續2日的支援行動，台中隊員們除完成道路清理與倒樹障礙排除任務外，更深刻感受到當地民眾滿滿的溫情與支持。\n環保局清潔同仁昨日在朴子市執行救援任務時，因近日連日降雨造成地面鬆軟，一部抓斗車不慎陷入泥沼，動彈不得。當下朴子市竹南里的里長得知情況後，立即親自駕駛鐵牛(耕耘機)趕至現場，以拖拉方式成功協助抓斗車脫困重返作業線。當地民眾也紛紛遞送茶水慰勞、鼓掌致意，甚至不吝比出大拇指為台中隊加油打氣，直說：「嘉義人就是自己人！」\n環保局也說，許多嘉義在地民眾看到台中隊揮汗工作，紛紛自動加入清理行列，拿起掃把、協助搬運枝幹，與台中隊並肩作戰，攜手為家園復原努力。這份跨縣市間的互助情誼，真切展現「同島一命、同舟共濟」的精神，也讓所有救災人員深受感動，士氣大振。\n環保局分享，此次支援行動也讓台中隊成員有親身體會「無網路世界」的經驗，災區已進入停電第四天，許多區域基地台受損，只能利用短暫經過尚有供電的地點，搶到一點訊號回覆工作訊息後，繼續救災工作。\n環保局表示，無論是地面作業的艱辛、通訊受阻的不便，或是來自民眾的溫暖與回應，都將成為此次災後支援最真實的印記；台中隊也將配合嘉義縣需求，持續投入人力與機具，陪伴受災地區一同走過復原之路。\n此篇文章最開始出處為:",

    "text": "Time-out is a well-known parenting technique that is used to deal with an unruly child exhibiting poor behavior.\nIt’s pretty simple: you take the child out of the situation where they’re not behaving and give them space to regain composure and reflect on what they did wrong.\nWhile I’ve heard of this being widely used on children, I can’t say I’ve ever heard about an adult trying to use this on another adult before. Well, that is, until now.\nThis 24-year-old girl has a boyfriend the same age as her, and he routinely puts her in “time-out” in an effort to punish her for something she did.\n“My boyfriend’s version of time-out is when he stops talking to me, ignores me, and doesn’t see me or communicate with me,” she explained.\n“I earned it last night because I expressed to him I have to be weary about him with women no matter their demographics because he has tried to sleep with multiple women online and at his workplace (old, young, everything).”\nNot only did her boyfriend put her in time-out, but he also picked up her coffee machine and threw it, causing it to break.\nThis all happened when she took a peek at his phone to see if he was paying women for photos, which is something she was worried about him doing behind her back.\nShe wasn’t angry with her boyfriend; she just expressed her feelings in a calm manner. She also didn’t find anything suspicious in his phone, by the way.\nSign up for Chip Chick’s newsletter and get stories like this delivered to your inbox.",

    "text": "Press Release Anesthesiologist Pleads Guilty to Taking Fentanyl from Hospital Western District of Missouri KANSAS CITY, Mo. – An anesthesiologist at a Lee’s Summit, Mo., hospital pleaded guilty in federal court today to illegally taking fentanyl from the hospital.\nRoman Peplinski, 37, of Kansas City, Mo., waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays to a federal information that charges him with one count of obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge.\nPeplinski was employed as an anesthesiologist at Union Hill Group in Kansas City, Mo. Peplinski worked at Lakewood Medical Center in Lee’s Summit and Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., which are both part of University Health.\nPeplinski admitted that he illegally obtained fentanyl from Lakewood Medical Center on Nov. 5, 2022. Peplinski misrepresented the fentanyl was for a patient, when in reality, that patient had been discharged from Lakewood Medical Center earlier that day. Fentanyl was not listed under the “medication orders” on the patient’s chart for the hospital visit.\nPeplinski also admitted to withdrawing fentanyl from three vials from Sept. 1, 2022, through Nov. 30, 2022.\nOn Feb. 16, 2023, personnel from Lakewood Medical Center reported to the Drug Enforcement Administration that three vials of fentanyl in an automated dispensing cabinet showed signs of tampering. In March 2023 seven vials of fentanyl that were suspected of being tampered with were sent to the FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center where tests were performed on the vials and their contents. Of the seven vials, three showed evidence of being tampered with. One of those vials contained no fentanyl and the other two vials contained a small amount of fentanyl.\nThe government has no evidence that any patients were harmed as a result of Peplinski tampering with vials of fentanyl.\nUnder federal statutes, Peplinski is subject to a sentence of up to four years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.\nThis case is being prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley Cooper. It was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations.\n ",

    "text": "Foto: Prensa Latina\nLa Habana, 27 mar (RHC) La Asociación Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) de Argentina continuará hoy su plan de lucha con la realización de un paro nacional y una movilización frente al Ministerio de Desregulación, en Buenos Aires.\nEn un comunicado, el secretario general de ATE, Rodolfo Aguiar, explicó que las acciones de protesta tienen como objetivo denunciar el riesgo en que se encuentran 50 mil ciudadanos, cuyos vínculos laborales vencen el 31 de este mes.\nTenemos que evitar que el Gobierno ejecute un nuevo recorte en el Estado. Todos los contratos deben ser renovados de manera automática. No toleraremos cesantías masivas, aseveró el dirigente.\nAguiar aseguró que su sindicato participará en un paro general convocado por la Confederación General del Trabajo para el 10 de abril, pero señaló que es necesaria esta otra medida de fuerza antes de esa fecha porque están en riesgo los puestos de esas personas.\nSon más de 50 mil vínculos laborales que vencen y ATE exige que cumplan con la renovación automática y anual, según lo establecido en la Resolución 26/24 del Ministerio de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado.\nNos movilizaremos hasta allí porque su titular, Federico Sturzenegger, es quien propone compensar el costo fiscal de los 800 millones de dólares que supone la baja de retenciones al campo y la eliminación de impuestos a los autos de alta gama con un nuevo achique del sector público, el cierre y la fusión de numerosos organismos, indicó.\nAdemás, cuestionó la continuidad de un congelamiento salarial, pidió reabrir de manera inmediata las paritarias (negociaciones) y exigió que sea reparado el daño causado a los ingresos.\nUn paro con movilización nos permitirá seguir defendiendo nuestro derecho constitucional a manifestarnos y peticionar libremente a las autoridades, dijo y resaltó la asistencia de los afiliados a ATE a una marcha por el Día de la Memoria por la Verdad y la Justicia.
