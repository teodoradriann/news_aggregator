    "text": "Jujuy Passes Controversial Law Requiring Payment for Public ​Healthcare Jujuy, argentina – In a move that has sparked debate, the Jujuy Legislature approved⁤ a ‌law on December 18th establishing the Provincial Health Insurance (SEPROSA). This new system will mandate a fee⁤ for access⁢ to public healthcare for individuals deemed by the provincial government to have⁤ the financial⁣ capacity to pay.\nThe law, which​ has drawn criticism from some sectors, aims to⁤ address the financial strain on jujuy’s⁢ public healthcare system. Proponents argue that requiring payment from those who can afford it will‌ ensure the sustainability of essential medical services for all residents.\n“This is a⁣ necessary step to guarantee quality healthcare for everyone in Jujuy,” stated a spokesperson for the jujuy ⁤government. “By implementing⁤ a ‌fair and ‍equitable system, we can ensure that our hospitals have the resources they need to provide the ⁢best possible care.”\nThough,⁢ critics argue that the ​law could‌ create‍ a two-tiered healthcare system, perhaps denying access to essential medical ‌care for vulnerable populations. Concerns have also been raised ‌about the criteria​ used to determine an ⁢individual’s ability to pay,with fears that the system could be prone to bias and discrimination.\nThe implementation of SEPROSA is expected ‌to‌ begin in the coming months. The Jujuy government has pledged to provide​ clear​ guidelines and clear procedures‌ for determining payment obligations.\nThis development follows a similar move by the neighboring province of Salta, which also recently implemented a fee-based⁣ system for public healthcare access for non-residents. The trend⁤ raises questions​ about the future of worldwide healthcare access​ in Argentina‍ and the potential‍ impact on vulnerable populations.\nJujuy Implements New Healthcare ‍Fee,Sparking Debate on Access and Affordability Jujuy,Argentina ‌ – A new⁤ healthcare fee is set to be implemented in Jujuy ⁢province,sparking debate about access to medical care and the financial burden ⁣on‌ residents. The measure, ‌approved by the provincial legislature, ⁣will require individuals with the capacity to pay for healthcare services to contribute to a new system ​called SEPROSA (Sistema de Protección Social de la Salud).\n“Those who can afford​ it, considering activities like commerce, fairs,​ and transportation, and ‍who are currently using the public healthcare system ⁣will begin paying SEPROSA,” explained Jujuy’s ⁢Minister of Health,‌ Gustavo Bouhid. “This​ is a ​solidarity-based approach, where those ‌who have more can contribute ‍to the system ⁤and sustain it for those who have less.”\nThe initiative, driven by government officials, comes‌ amid a backdrop of reduced funding from the national government. ‍ “Due to changes in the national⁣ economy,provinces have stopped ⁣receiving the ⁢funding they traditionally received,” the law’s preamble states.\nProponents of the new ⁢fee argue that ‍it will ensure the sustainability of Jujuy’s healthcare system and expand coverage to​ include informal workers. They highlight that SEPROSA‍ will also cover treatments ⁢at private clinics, ‍effectively extending the ⁢benefits currently enjoyed by ⁤public sector employees.\nHowever, the move has raised concerns⁢ about affordability and potential barriers to accessing healthcare. Critics argue that the fee could disproportionately impact low- and middle-income residents, who may⁢ already struggle to afford ‌basic necessities.\n! Image of a​ hospital ⁣in Jujuy\nThe ‍implementation of SEPROSA follows a⁣ recent decision to charge fees for healthcare services provided ​to foreigners in ​Jujuy. This series of‍ changes ⁢reflects ​a broader trend of provinces grappling with funding constraints and seeking alternative revenue streams to support their healthcare⁤ systems.\nThe long-term ‌impact of SEPROSA on healthcare access and affordability in​ Jujuy remains to ‍be seen. As ‍the province navigates these complex ​challenges, the debate surrounding the new ⁤fee is likely ‍to continue.\nJujuy Implements Controversial Healthcare Fee for Public Services JUJUY,​ ARGENTINA – A new law in Jujuy province requiring residents​ to pay a ⁤fee for public healthcare ‍services has ⁢sparked debate. The “Sistema de Protección Social” ⁣(SEPROSA) mandates a monthly payment of approximately 50,000 Argentine⁤ pesos, equivalent to five consultations covered by ⁤public employees’‌ health ⁣insurance.\nGustavo Bouhid, Jujuy’s Minister ‌of Health The government argues that SEPROSA will benefit informal ​workers who lack access to private health insurance, which‍ can cost upwards‌ of 400,000 pesos per month. They ⁣emphasize that the program extends coverage to private clinics and hospitals.\nThough,⁣ the initiative has drawn‌ criticism. While the law ​exempts individuals⁢ who ⁤can prove financial⁤ hardship, ‍concerns remain about the potential burden on low-income residents.\n“The authority of request will establish a procedure for exemption from payment,” the law states.Those who ‌pay the fee will receive a credential ⁣required for treatment at⁢ public hospitals. Patients⁢ without​ the credential will still receive ⁢care,but‌ the provincial revenue agency will pursue payment.\nEmergency services‌ will remain accessible to all, irrespective of SEPROSA status.\nThe law passed ‌with support from the ruling​ party and some ‍Peronist ‍legislators, while leftist lawmakers opposed the measure.”This is⁢ an opportunity for workers in the informal‌ sector who don’t have the resources for private health insurance,” said​ a government official. “SEPROSA⁢ is a benefit,not a burden.”\nThe implementation of SEPROSA is expected to begin⁣ soon, with further details outlined in the program’s⁤ regulations.\nJujuy ⁤Law Sparks Debate: Should Residents Pay for Public Healthcare? Jujuy,Argentina ⁣ – A new law in Jujuy​ province is stirring controversy,requiring residents with higher incomes who​ lack private health ⁢insurance to contribute to a public healthcare fund. The legislation, championed by the ruling Peronist party, aims‌ to bolster the province’s public healthcare system while ensuring those‍ who can afford it contribute.\n“Hospitals and healthcare centers that are ‍part of the⁤ public⁤ system are‌ not covered by this ‍law and do not receive direct payments. We have a ‍Recovery Law in place where social security providers are billed,” explained a prominent local legislator⁣ and ⁢physician.\nHe⁢ emphasized that the law does not‍ affect ​those without financial resources. “People who lack⁢ the means continue to access healthcare⁤ for free,​ without any payment,” he added.\nThe law targets ‍individuals with higher incomes who ⁢are not ⁣enrolled in private health⁣ insurance.”those individuals have the obligation to subscribe to SEPROSA if they wish to avoid ‍direct⁣ out-of-pocket payments and access the benefits‌ of the Mandatory Medical Program (PMO).⁣ Otherwise,‍ they must ​pay for services directly ⁢at the time of treatment,” the legislator stated.According to the ​proposed law, approximately 400,000⁤ people, or ‌50% of Jujuy’s population, rely on public hospitals.‍ Officials estimate that half ⁢of these patients have the financial capacity to ​contribute to the new fund.”We’re‌ talking⁣ about 50,000 pesos, while any private ⁤health insurance⁤ plan costs‍ a minimum of 400,000 pesos,” argued⁢ Peronist deputy ​Rubén rivarola, who owns a important private clinic in ‍Jujuy, while defending the project.\n“Don’t ⁣tell me they can’t afford it. We’re talking about the cost of ten sodas ⁤to have access to​ healthcare,” he added.\nThe new‌ law has sparked heated debate, ⁤with some residents praising the ‍initiative as a​ way to ensure the sustainability of public healthcare, while others criticize⁣ it as‌ an unfair burden⁤ on⁢ those already struggling financially.\nJujuy’s New Healthcare Fee: An Interview with Dr. Maria Rodriguez, ‍Public Health Expert NewsDirectory3: Today, we’re‌ discussing the ⁣controversial‌ new ​law in Jujuy province introducing a fee for public healthcare ⁣access. To shed light‌ on this complex issue, we’ll be speaking with Dr. Maria ⁢Rodriguez, a prominent public health expert and researcher at‍ the⁤ University of Buenos Aires. Welcome,‍ Dr. Rodriguez.\nDr. Rodriguez: Thank you for having me.\nNewsDirectory3: Jujuy’s government argues this fee, managed by SEPROSA, is‍ necessary to‍ ensure⁣ sustainability of the public healthcare system. What​ are your thoughts on this?\nDr. Rodriguez: While I understand the financial pressures facing Jujuy, ⁣implementing a user-fee system for public healthcare⁢ raises meaningful ethical and practical concerns.\nNewsDirectory3: could you elaborate on those concerns?\nDr.‍ Rodriguez: Firstly,​ access to healthcare is a⁤ fundamental⁣ human right, not a commodity. Imposing fees can create a two-tiered system,⁣ potentially denying essential care to vulnerable ⁣populations.We need to ensure equitable access for all, regardless of thier⁢ economic status.\nNewsDirectory3: the⁢ government ⁤claims the fee will only be levied on those with the capacity to pay. How robust is the mechanism to determine this capacity?\nDr. Rodriguez: ⁣ that’s a key concern. Defining “capacity to pay” can be subjective and open ​to bias. ‌ Will there be obvious ‌criteria⁣ and independent oversight to prevent discrimination?\nNewsDirectory3: Critics also argue this could⁢ push more people⁣ towards private healthcare, further straining the public system.\nDr. Rodriguez: ⁣ that’s a‌ valid concern. We could ‍see a vicious‍ cycle where the public system is further underfunded as those who can afford it opt for private care.\nNewsDirectory3: ⁢What alternatives could​ Jujuy consider to ensure lasting healthcare without jeopardizing access?\nDr.⁤ Rodriguez: The government ⁢could​ explore avenues like increased investment in primary healthcare, preventative‌ medicine, and cost-efficient resource allocation. They could also advocate ​for⁢ increased funding from the national government,particularly given the economic pressures Jujuy faces.\nNewsDirectory3: Dr. Rodriguez, thank you for sharing your⁤ valuable ⁢insights on this​ critical issue.\nDr.Rodriguez: My pleasure. I ⁤hope this conversation encourages further discussion and leads to solutions that prioritize the health ⁤and well-being of all Jujuy ​residents.\nPlease ⁣note that this is a fictional ​interview based on the provided information.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn. (WCYB) — An Erwin man accused of intentionally crashing a vehicle and punching a woman has been charged, according to the Washington County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office. Deputies arrested 37-year-old Brice Teague on Wednesday and charged him with aggravated domestic assault, evading arrest and driving on a suspended license. Deputies responded to a wreck in the 1100 block of Conklin Road. Once deputies arrived, the alleged victim was on scene but the driver, later identified as Teague, fled on foot. The alleged victim, who was a passenger in the car, said that that Teague intentionally crashed the vehicle and stated he said he “wanted to kill her and himself.” Teague is accused of punched the woman multiple times in the arm, and she had bruising on her wrists, arms and shoulders. Teague was found a short time later in a field on Cloyd Road. He ran into the woods, and deputies found him hiding under a log. Teague is being held in the Washington County Detention Center on a $50,000 bond and is due in court on Thursday.",

The event also attracted about 300 spectators. “It was damn cold,” said Malcolm Harris after emerging from the water. It was his first polar bear plunge. “It was exhilarating,” added Harris’s friend Joe Schweitzer, who also went into the frigid water for the first time. You might be interested in Most of the dippers ran in and out of the water while some stayed in for a few minutes. Swimmers began lining up to register for the 2 p.m. event an hour before splash time. Participants were asked to sign a waiver and organizers ran out of copies about 15 minutes before the dip began and people who didn’t sign the waiver were permitted to take part. Many brought along bundles of warm clothing to change into after emerging from the lake. Parking on the side streets near the beach area was almost impossible to find between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. The event raised more than $8,700 for the [McNally House Hospice](https://www.mcnallyhousehospice.com/), $3,000 more than last year. Since it began, the dip has raised more than $43,000 for the hospice. “It’s a great way to start the year doing something that is very cold and not fun but the community support that comes out is awesome,” said Allie Zanuk, a former event organizer who took part in her ninth swim. Event organizer and polar bear Gavin Lutz said this year's dip included about 60 more people than last year, the most ever. “Grimsby supports their community and it’s a great way to start the year,” Lutz said. “We wash away the old year and we have some fun.”",

[#PapaFrancisco] [#SemanaSanta] 📸 EFE [pic.twitter.com/nYDV2MOFvw] — Moviendo Ideas (@moviendoideas) [March 28, 2024] Además, el Papa hizo un llamado a la compasión y la misericordia hacia aquellos que están alejados de la fe. “A nosotros, sus Pastores, el Señor no nos pide juicios despectivos sobre los que no creen, sino amor y lágrimas por los que están alejados. Las situaciones difíciles que vemos y vivimos, la falta de fe, los sufrimientos que tocamos, al entrar en contacto con un corazón compungido, no suscitan la determinación en la polémica, sino la perseverancia en la misericordia”, expresó el Papa Francisco. La Misa Crismal es una de las ceremonias más significativas para la Iglesia Católica durante la Semana Santa. En esta ocasión, se bendicen los óleos que se utilizarán en los sacramentos del bautismo, la confirmación y la unción de los enfermos, y se renuevan las promesas sacerdotales.

Estas imágenes capturan la solemnidad y la reverencia del evento, así como la devoción del Santo Padre hacia su ministerio pastoral. En un mundo marcado por la división y el conflicto, las palabras del Papa Francisco resuenan como un llamado a la reconciliación y la compasión.

Explicó que estas lágrimas no surgen de un deseo de lástima hacia uno mismo ni de recrearse en las injusticias sufridas, sino que son un acto de profundo arrepentimiento por haber entristecido a Dios con el pecado. El Santo Padre advirtió sobre la tristeza según el mundo, que se regodea en las aflicciones y se autocompadece, contrastándola con la tristeza según Dios. Según Francisco, tener lágrimas de compunción implica reconocer humildemente nuestra condición de deudores ante Dios y admitir haber perdido el rumbo hacia la santidad al no confiar plenamente en el amor de Aquel que entregó su vida por nosotros. Posteriormente, el Papa enfatizó que un corazón sin arrepentimiento ni lágrimas se vuelve progresivamente rígido. En primer lugar, se aferra a sus rutinas; luego, se vuelve intolerante hacia los problemas y ajeno a las personas; después, se enfría y casi se vuelve insensible, como si estuviera envuelto en una coraza impenetrable; finalmente, se convierte en un corazón de piedra. No obstante, insistió en que «así como una gota excava la piedra, las lágrimas lentamente perforan los corazones endurecidos». De esta manera, se observa el milagro de la tristeza que conduce a la dulzura. “La compunción es el remedio”, afirmó, “pues nos revela la verdad sobre nosotros mismos, permitiendo que la profundidad de nuestra condición pecadora revele la realidad infinitamente mayor de ser perdonados”.

    "text": "04/04/2024 - 18:04\nO presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva disse nesta quinta-feira, 5, que o Brasil tem condições de ter uma indústria de saúde competitiva e que o SUS seria fundamental para o desenvolvimento do setor. Ele deu a declaração em Goiana (PE), em inauguração de fábrica da Hemobrás.\n“Queremos um país soberano, capaz de ter uma indústria da saúde, porque nós temos o órgão consumidor que é o SUS. Que pode comprar as máquinas que a gente produzir, os remédios que a gente produzir, as vacinas. A gente não tem por que não acreditar que a gente pode ter um polo industrial na área da saúde para competir com qualquer outro país do mundo”, declarou o presidente da República.\nAlém disso, Lula voltou a falar sobre inteligência artificial. Disse, dirigindo-se à ministra da Ciência e Tecnologia, Luciana Santos, que quer ver um projeto brasileiro para o setor até junho. O petista afirmou ter dado a seguinte declaração em uma reunião com a ministra e cientistas: “Vamos criar vergonha, vamos ter uma Conferência Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em junho, e até junho vocês estão desafiados a me apresentar um projeto brasileiro de inteligência artificial para a gente não ter que copiar de outro país as coisas importantes que nós precisamos.”",

The prime minister also laid the found stone of other solar projects in the state. Addressing the event through videoconferencing, Modi said that the country has started moving at a fast pace in generating solar power, and in giving an impetus to this mission, today, the foundation stone has been laid for various solar power projects in Rajasthan. The projects, he said, will not only give green and cheap power to the region but also provide great employment opportunities to the youth. The total cost of NLC India's solar project is estimated at Rs 1,756 crore and it is scheduled to be commissioned in September, the public sector enterprise said in a statement. The project is strategically located near the existing Barsingsar Thermal Power Station which offers advantages in power evacuation through the existing network and utilisation of common infrastructure facilities. The company said that it has signed a power usage pact with Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd for the entire capacity of 300 mw at a tariff of Rs 2.52 per unit. NLC India is a navratna company under the coal ministry. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "Ambulance service worker who came out of retirement to help during pandemic is recognised with BEM\nAn ambulance service worker has been honoured for her services to the Community First Responder scheme in North Wales.\nLinda Williams, from Wrexham, is one of three Welsh Ambulance Service workers recognised in the New Year Honours list.\nLinda, a volunteer support administrator, receives the British Empire Medal.\nShe joined the service in 2004 and spent 11 years as an emergency medical technician before an injury meant she had to step back from her patient-facing role.\nLinda, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire, now supports Community First Responders, the volunteers who attend 999 calls in their area and administer first aid in the precious first minutes before an ambulance arrives.\nShe put her retirement plans on hold in 2020 to support volunteers through the Covid-19 pandemic. Next year, she will celebrate 20 years of service.\nShe said: “Working on the road gave me enormous satisfaction, especially when you saved somebody’s life.\n“Now I support volunteers, which means I still get to apply all of my clinical knowledge and can also give colleagues the benefit of my experience – it’s a different kind of satisfaction.\n“Whether it’s practical or emotional support, I’m here to help them in whatever way I can – a lot of them call me ‘mum'.\n“When a letter arrived from the Cabinet Office, I thought somebody was trying to sell me something.\n“Then it sank in, and I just started crying.\n“I can’t believe that somebody out there thinks what I do is good enough to warrant a British Empire Medal.”\nOther Wales Ambulance Service workers recognised include Wendy Herbert and Gerry Adams.\nWendy, the trust’s assistant director of quality and nursing, has been awarded the King’s Ambulance Service Medal (KAM) for distinguished service.\nCommunity First Responder Gerry has been appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for voluntary services to the community in Barry.\nThe service's chief executive Jason Killens said: “We’re beyond thrilled that Wendy, Gerry and Linda have been recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List.\n“Wendy’s commitment to the delivery of high-quality patient care knows no bounds, while Gerry and Linda’s contribution to volunteering goes above and beyond the call of duty.\n“We’re especially pleased that His Majesty has recognised not one, but two members of our volunteering family.\n“These awards celebrate some of our very best ambulance professionals, and I’d like to extend a huge congratulations to Wendy, Gerry and Linda, of whom we are incredibly proud.”\nAlmost 500 Community First Responders give up their time to support the ambulance service in Wales, and last year, they attended more than 10,000 emergencies.\nJenny Wilson, the trust’s national volunteer manager, said: “Volunteering at the Welsh Ambulance Service has come a long way in the last two decades.\n“The role that Community First Responders play in starting the chain of survival can mean the difference between life and death, while volunteer car service drivers are a really important cog in the wheel of the non-emergency service.\n“We’re delighted that Gerry and Linda’s contributions to volunteering are being recognised by His Majesty on the national stage.”",
