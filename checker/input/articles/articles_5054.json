    "title": "Even Jenna Ortega Isn’t Enough to Save 'Miller’s Girl' from a Bad Trope | Cincinnati | Cincinnati CityBeat",
    "text": "When I heard about the new movie Miller’s Girl, my initial reaction was, We’re still making these? The story of a clever, cunning, desirable teenage girl wrapping a middle-aged man around her little finger and sending him down a life-destroying path was a major plot in the 1990s: Poison Ivy, The Crush, Wild Things. Alyssa Milano starred in a bunch of straight-to-video flicks. There was even one in the mid-aughts, Pretty Persuasion, where Evan Rachel Wood was the manipulative nymphet. Maybe it’s because erotic thrillers have been making a comeback of sorts (as my colleague Kayla McCulloch summarized [in a recent review](/arts/in-may-december-todd-haynes-turns-an-old-tabloid-tale-into-a-first-rate-sexual-thriller-16320305)) that Lionsgate greenlit this tale of forbidden seduction. However, since we’re also living in a time when people know what “grooming” means (and have zero tolerance for anyone who’s caught doing that shit), a movie about a middle-aged man succumbing to a tempestuous teen just may be the wrong thing to drop in theaters — even if the teen is played by the in-demand Jenna Ortega. Yes, the new Wednesday Addams plays the absurdly named Cairo Sweet, a highly intelligent 18-year-old who lives alone in a big mansion (her parents are always away) and longs to be a provocative writer. She finds a mentor in Jonathan Miller (Martin Freeman), her high school English teacher. Dude is immediately won over by this well-read, wise-beyond-her-years youngin’, especially when he finds out she’s been reading the only book he ever published, a collection of short stories. Screenwriter Jade Halley Bartlett (who originally was hired to write the Doctor Strange sequel before she was dismissed) uses her directorial debut to kill two birds with one stone, making both a salacious, Southern-fried hothouse drama and an almost-obnoxiously erudite commentary on gender power dynamics. Bartlett has said in interviews that the script started out as a play, and it so shows. The dialogue is Aaron Sorkin-style wordy, while many of the scenes, especially between Freeman and Ortega, are staged like a hot-and-bothered version of David Mamet’s sexual harassment study Oleanna. Also, the movie is set in Tennessee (it was really filmed in Georgia, of course), which means that most of the cast talk like they’re cats on a hot tin roof. This includes Miller’s wife (Dagmara Dominczyk), a boozy, foul-mouthed workaholic who’s amused (and slightly turned on) that her husband has a groupie; and Sweet’s BFF (Gideon Adlon, King of the Hill actress Pamela Adlon’s daughter), a “lesbian” who still wants to get deflowered by Miller’s baseball coach buddy (Sherman’s Showcase/South Side co-creator/star Bashir Salahuddin). It’s kinda wild watching Freeman, that sardonic, nebbishy Brit from the original The Office, play a so-called Southern gent who tries (and fails) not to fall for the flirty, feminine wiles of Ortega’s scintillating sociopath. When Sweet writes an insanely filthy, Henry Miller-esque short story, the guy has no choice but to go to his office/shed and rub one out. Yeah, that’s some creepy shit. And although Ortega gives it her all as an adolescent who’s more intelligent than emotionally stable (the tearful, vindictive, one-take dressing-down her character gives Miller after he rejects her and her short story could very well be the best piece of acting she’s done so far in her young career), the movie doesn’t know whether to make her savvy and self-aware or deranged and straight-up damaged. Even when it oozes with extraness, Miller’s Girl is an erotic thriller that isn’t that erotic or thrilling. Bartlett seems almost too afraid to actually take that leap and make everyone in this awkward-ass yarn slide into the amoral abyss. Miller may be a horny egomaniac and Sweet may be just fucked up in the head, but Bartlett sees them as sad, lonely kindred spirits secretly looking for affection and admiration. To be honest, watching a story of May-December sordidness just feels icky at this point in time. Before I saw this, I caught part two of Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story, the Netflix docuseries about a revered, British celeb who spent most of his career sexually assaulting children, practically going to his grave without being punished for his crimes. Seeing randy, older guys and coquettish, younger girls do the will-they-or-won’t-they dance may have been entertainingly naughty 30 years ago. But in this post-#MeToo era, Miller’s Girl is just another reminder that men will always be ready to risk it all for a pretty, young thang.

    "title": "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in the Healthcare Sector",
    "text": "The healthcare industry is no stranger to cybersecurity risk concerns. In the last few years, the world has witnessed several instances of cybersecurity threats and interferences, from cyberattacks on customer accounts containing prescription information, to ransomware attacks on patient records systems and health payment processing companies, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in DNA sequencing instruments. Since 2010, cyberattacks in healthcare have exposed 385 million patient records and cost an average of almost $11 million per event.\nThe most common types of cybersecurity threats include:\nRansomware and malware attacks, which potentially disable hospitals’ medical devices and critical infrastructure (including interrupting or halting procedures at threat to people’s lives and well-being), upend payment processing systems, and/or leak patients’ personal data; Cybersecurity breaches of hospital networks, core systems, and remote operation of devices (including telehealth), which also present potential physical threats (including loss of power); and Unpatched and out-of-date software in medical devices. Many medical devices require updates to embedded software in a timely manner. Patches and updates can be delayed or missed for a variety of reasons, and unpatched vulnerabilities can open a door for threat actors to gain unauthorized access to the device and the network it is connected to in order to steal patient data. RECENT HEALTHCARE CYBERATTACKS Three recent cyberattacks within the healthcare industry have resulted in massive fallout for doctors and patients, serving as a reminder that the healthcare industry is a prime target for cybercriminals. In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth and the US’s largest processor of medical claims, suffered a ransomware attack that took its systems offline. Widely regarded as the most significant cybersecurity attack in the history of the American healthcare industry, the exposure purportedly leaked the personal data of up to a third of Americans and disrupted billions of dollars in patient payments. The attack also froze Change Healthcare’s pharmacy systems across the US, leading to delayed deliveries of prescription drugs nationwide. While testifying before Congress in early May 2024 about the data breach, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty admitted to paying $22 million in ransom to the hackers. The Office of Civil Rights has launched an investigation into whether Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth violated HIPAA regulations.\nIn April 2024, Kaiser Permanente disclosed a data breach impacting approximately 13.4 million individuals. The breach reportedly resulted from the improper implementation of tracking codes on the company’s digital platforms, which inadvertently shared patient data with third-party advertisers. The compromised information included sensitive details such as patients’ names, IP addresses, and specific interactions with Kaiser’s online services. Subsequently, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Kaiser Permanente, alleging that the organization disclosed patients’ personal information to third parties without consent, violating state wiretapping and consumer-protection laws. As of now, no government investigation has been announced regarding this breach.\nOn May 9, 2024, Ascension, one of the largest healthcare systems in the US, revealed that a cyberattack had forced patient record systems to go offline. The attack disabled a variety of other electronic services as well, resulting in hospitals reverting to charting patient care on paper. On June 14, 2024, Ascension reported that it restored its electronic health records across the system. Multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed , alleging that Ascension’s negligence led to the compromise of personal identifying information and protected health information.\nThe Change Healthcare, Kaiser Permanente, and Ascension incidents highlight the importance of improving the healthcare industry’s defense posture in order to protect sensitive patient health information and prevent the disruption of hospital operations. As cybercriminals across the globe continue to target healthcare organizations, the healthcare industry should prioritize the development and implementation of tactical strategies to prepare for and mitigate damages arising from such attacks. Such strategies should include adherence to the latest government-enforced cybersecurity standards and increased collaboration with other entities operating in the space to address shared vulnerabilities.\nU.S. GUIDANCE FOR CYBERSECURITY RISK MINIMIZATION Healthcare providers and device manufacturers can take a variety of steps to better manage the cybersecurity risks present in the healthcare industry. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published voluntary healthcare-specific Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to bolster critical healthcare infrastructure and protect against cyber threats. Moreover, in 2022, FDA published Draft Cybersecurity Guidance for Medical Devices , proposing guidelines for manufacturers to minimize cybersecurity risks. The intent of the FDA guidance is to encourage stakeholders to emphasize transparency and security throughout the development of devices. The FBI has also published recommendations targeted at unpatched and outdated medical devices that complement those set out by FDA. These materials set market standards for basic measures that can be taken to protect against cyber threats. The companies to which they apply would do well to review and consider the feasibility of these recommendations within their own environments. Some states like California and Oregon have passed laws establishing a baseline cybersecurity requirement for healthcare providers. As technology progresses, we expect cybersecurity laws, rules, regulations, and guidance to continue to evolve.\nRISK MANAGEMENT Companies are exploring novel solutions to mitigate risk , including by using innovative technology, such as blockchain and digital twins. Blockchain creates a secure and permanent transaction trail, so any time data is accessed or moved, that action can be traced. Blockchain also decentralizes the storage of data, reducing the cybersecurity risks associated with the management of a central system. Digital twins are virtual copies of medical devices, patients, or environments that can help predict reactions, developments, and other unknown factors in healthcare by mimicking both physical properties and operational algorithms. Digital twins help with efficient lifecycle management of medical devices and increase transparency during the development of cybersecurity programs.\nNonetheless, it is important to note that these novel solutions come with their own set of cybersecurity concerns. For example, digital twins require layering technology to obtain data and could increase entry points for cybersecurity breaches through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which monitor factors such as bed availability, machine performance, and the temperature of volatile resources; edge computing, which decentralizes the data processing centers; and AI.\nConclusion The recent cyberattacks in the healthcare sector underscore the need for the industry to adopt proactive cybersecurity measures and implement robust safeguards. In addition to close adherence to government-enforced cybersecurity standards, continued coordination among industry stakeholders is likely needed to identify and address cybersecurity challenges and ensure that cybercriminals cannot continue to take advantage of vulnerabilities in this space. Navigating cybersecurity risks in these ways will foster greater transparency among all stakeholders involved and ultimately, increase patients’ trust and confidence in the healthcare sector.\nImage: ID 108494042 © Siriporn Kaenseeya | Dreamstime.com",

    "text": "La Cooperativa Agraria Ecológica y Solidaria Piura (CAES Piura) exportará 150 toneladas de maní orgánico a Francia, con apoyo del programa Sierra y Selva Exportadora del Ministerio de Desarrollo Agrario y Riego (Midagri).\nEsta exportación se realiza impulsada por la creciente demanda global y la tendencia al alza en el consumo de alimentos saludables.\nLa referida cooperativa ya realizó con éxito un primer envío de más de 20 toneladas de maní orgánico a Francia, como parte del compromiso comercial de 150 toneladas con la empresa Ethiquable, para este 2024.\nEn ese sentido, la cooperativa ya programó cuatro despachos adicionales, que se realizarán en los meses de mayo, agosto, noviembre y diciembre.\nPara asegurar la calidad y garantizar la sostenibilidad comercial, Sierra y Selva Exportadora brindó el servicio de asistencia técnica en el campo y en la planta de proceso para cumplir las exigencias orgánicas, de calidad y certificaciones que exige la empresa compradora.\n- Adex: número de productos de canasta agroexportadora del Perú creció 3.9%\nPrimer exportador de maní orgánico\nCAES Piura, integrada por 147 pequeños productores de los distritos de Montero, Jilili y Sicchez, donde 40 de ellos se dedican exclusivamente al cultivo de maní, consolida su posición como exportador confiable de productos agrícolas saludables en el mercado internacional sobre la base de prácticas culturales tradicionales para el manejo de plagas y enfermedades.\nAdemás de ser el primer y único exportador de maní orgánico del Perú, CAES Piura también exporta panela, chifles y harina de plátano de seda orgánico.\nSus productos cuentan con certificaciones orgánicas reconocidas a nivel internacional, incluyendo USDA Organic, European Union (EUNOP), RTPO, JAS y SPP Comercio Justo, garantizando la calidad y la trazabilidad de la producción.\nElmer Meza, gerente de la Cooperativa CAES Piura, destacó el papel crucial de la articulación comercial cumplido por Sierra y Selva Exportadora y Ethiquable, no sólo en el logro de sus objetivos comerciales, sino también en la mejora de los ingresos y la dinamización de la agricultura local.\nImpulso a la economía regional\nCon un enfoque de responsabilidad social, CAES Piura ha contribuido significativamente a la generación de empleo sostenible en la región Piura, ofreciendo oportunidades de trabajo digno para los habitantes locales y reduciendo la migración de jóvenes hacia áreas urbanas en busca de empleo.\nEn este sentido, la exportación de maní orgánico a Francia no sólo representa un éxito comercial para CAES Piura, sino también un testimonio del potencial del sector agrícola peruano para ofrecer productos de alta calidad al mercado global, impulsando así el desarrollo económico y social del país.\nPrincipales mercados\nEn el Perú se cultivan aproximadamente 3,500 hectáreas de maní, las cuales están distribuidas en su mayoría en los valles de la costa de Lima y Piura y, en menor proporción, en las regiones de Ayacucho, San Martín y Loreto.\nDurante este 2024, la región Piura proyecta producir 200 toneladas de maní orgánico con un rendimiento de seis toneladas por hectárea, siendo CAES Piura la principal organización dedicada a la producción y comercialización de dicho producto.\nEs importante indicar que los principales países importadores de maní son Alemania, Países Bajos, Francia, España, Estados Unidos y China.\nMás en Andina:\nIngreso promedio en Lima Metropolitana subió 6.8% entre noviembre 2023 y enero 2024.

    "text": "Saber más\nEl Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú (Senamhi) informó que se prevé un descenso de las temperaturas nocturnas en la costa peruana entre el 10 y el 15 de mayo. La entidad, adscrita al Ministerio del Ambiente, detalló que este fenómeno afectará principalmente a las regiones desde Ica hasta Piura.\nDe acuerdo con el pronóstico, las temperaturas nocturnas oscilarán entre los 10 °C y 15 °C en Ica; entre 14 °C y 17 °C para Lima; entre 15 °C y 17 °C en Áncash; entre 14 °C y 18 °C en La Libertad; entre 15 °C y 17 °C en Lambayeque; y entre 17 °C y 20 °C en Piura. En tanto, en Lima Metropolitana se esperan temperaturas mínimas entre los 15 °C y 16 °C.\nMIRA:[Extorsionadores dejan dos explosivos en colegio particular de Comas]\nEl Senamhi explicó que este descenso se debe, principalmente, a la presencia de aguas frías frente al litoral peruano. A ello se suma la intensificación de los vientos del sur, que contribuyen a generar mayor nubosidad durante las mañanas y condiciones más frías en zonas costeras.\nSegún la entidad, la sensación térmica será más baja especialmente en los distritos cercanos al mar durante las mañanas. No obstante, se prevé presencia de brillo solar hacia el mediodía.\nEl Senamhi recomendó a la población tomar las precauciones necesarias. Asimismo, sugirió mantenerse informado a través de sus canales oficiales para conocer los pronósticos actualizados.\n¿Cuándo empieza el invierno en el Perú en 2025?\nEl invierno astronómico en el Perú comenzará el 20 de junio de 2025 a las 9:42 p. m., de acuerdo con el calendario del hemisferio sur.\nCabe señalar que las estaciones astronómicas son las mismas para la costa, sierra y selva del territorio nacional. Sin embargo, cada región presentará características climáticas propias durante el invierno, influenciadas por su ubicación geográfica y altitud.",
