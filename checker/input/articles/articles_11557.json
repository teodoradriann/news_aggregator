    "text": "State lawmakers pass bill to give breathing room for wildfire survivors facing evictions\n[Brian Perry](#author)\nJune 21, 2024, 7:00 AM HST\nA bill amending Hawaii’s Landlord-Tenant Code would protect wildfire survivor renters from evictions once the governor’s emergency moratorium shielding them expires.\nHouse Bill 2742 establishes a pre-litigation mediation procedure for tenants who are subject to the wildfire survivor eviction moratorium issued under Gov. Josh Green’s emergency proclamations following the Aug. 8, 2023, Lahaina and Upcountry wildfires.\nUnder the bill, the amended Landlord-Tenant Code would restrict when landlord remedies are available depending on the amount of rent due. The measure appropriates $410,000 to the state Judiciary to contract for mediation services.\nThe bill includes a legislative finding that, following the Maui wildfires, thousands of residents lost their jobs and have been unable to pay rent. The governor issued emergency wildfire proclamations that have provided protections for struggling renters, including an eviction moratorium that will eventually expire.\n“Therefore, a balanced approach is needed to encourage communications and facilitate mediation between landlords and tenants to help reduce the number of summary possession proceedings that are expected to follow the expiration of certain wildfire proclamations,” the measure says.\nThe state Judiciary submitted\nwritten testimony in support of House Bill 2742.\n“An early landlord-tenant mediation process… would help both landlords and tenants avoid the eviction process with voluntary agreements,” the Judiciary said.\nSuch mediation has already been found to be successful when it was implemented in 2021 following the lifting of eviction moratoriums after the COVID-19 pandemic, the Judiciary said.\nAn early landlord-tenant mediation process implemented through Act 57 for a one-year period resulted in 1,660 landlord-tenant mediation cases involving past-due rent statewide. Of those, 1,415, or 85%, concluded with agreements and enabled more than 1,140 tenants and their families to remain in their residences.\nIf signed by the governor, the bill would go into effect July 1. Certain provisions are repealed on Dec. 31, 2026, or on the one-year anniversary of the expiration of the governor’s final eviction moratorium emergency proclamation, whichever occurs sooner.\nGov. Green has until June 25 to issue a notice of intent to veto any bills. Any bill not on that list will become law without or without his signature. If a bill is on the “intent to veto” list, the governor then has until July 10 to veto it.\n ",

Voici, en chiffres, l'effet que cette 2e baisse consécutive aura sur vos intérêts 2025.\nC'est officiel ! Le ministère de l'Économie a confirmé aujourd'hui la triste nouvelle : le taux du Livret d'épargne populaire (LEP) va dégringoler le 1er août prochain, passant de 3,50% à 2,70%, net de fiscalité ! Et encore : la Banque de France a recommandé de lui donner un coup de pouce, comme ils l'ont déjà fait par le passé. En appliquant strictement la formule de calcul, il serait passé à 2,20% !\nLivret A, LEP, LDDS... Voici les nouveaux taux officiels au 1er août 2025\nLe taux du LEP subit ainsi directement la baisse conjointe des deux variables qui entrent en compte pour le calcul de son taux : l'inflation et les taux courts interbancaires.\nCette deuxième baisse de l'année (il était déjà passé de 4% à 3,50% le 1er février) a une conséquence évidente : le LEP va rapporter beaucoup moins d'argent aux épargnants en 2025 qu'en 2024 et en 2023. Son taux annuel moyen 2025 va être de 3,21%, contre 4,67% en 2024 et 5,93% en 2023.\nCela va se ressentir, évidemment, sur les intérêts que vous allez toucher en fin d'année :",
