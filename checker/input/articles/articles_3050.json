This is bigger. It’s about the silicon at the heart of the country’s AI ambitions. Beijing has begun pressing its largest technology firms — Tencent, ByteDance, Baidu — to step away from Nvidia’s H20 chips and pivot toward homegrown processors. The message isn’t wrapped in sanctions or bans, but the undertone is unmistakable: the future of China’s AI infrastructure will not be built on foreign hardware.\nThe Security Question Beijing Won’t Ignore\nOfficials aren’t simply making a case for “buying local” — they’re sounding alarms about security and sovereignty. Procurement processes often require sharing technical and operational details with U.S. authorities, a move Chinese regulators say could expose sensitive data. On top of that, whispers about possible backdoors in foreign chips have only deepened the mistrust. In a geopolitical climate already strained by export controls and trade restrictions, Beijing’s caution feels less like overreaction and more like calculated self-defense.\nDomestic Chips Over Performance Perfection\nChina’s local chipmakers aren’t yet matching Nvidia’s H20 in raw processing power, but performance isn’t the priority here — resilience is. Regulators are making it clear that short-term trade-offs are worth the long-term payoff of independence. Some companies have already started scaling back H20 orders, while others hesitate due to workload compatibility.

    "text": "Long-time Vancouver jazz champion Gavin Walker has died, with friends praising his devotion to the genre he loved\nGet the best of Vancouver in your inbox, every Tuesday and Thursday. Sign up for our free newsletter.\nGavin Walker, who has long been known as one of Vancouver's most impassioned champions of jazz, has died, with his passing mourning by family, friends, and long-time admirers.\nIn a Facebook post, his nephew Sean U’yenetsechia Smith wrote: I am posting to share that my uncle Gavin, my dad’s brother had passed away this past weekend. We share the news to notify family as well as Gavin’s many friends in Vancouver and beyond. Uncle Gavin loved his many friends which I think he felt were his family as we live in the Yukon.”\nHe added: “Yes it’s sad news to share but Uncle always loved to connect with his friends and family. We will truly remember what a cool dude uncle was and always will be.”\nOriginally from Montreal, Walker moved to Vancouver, working as an alto saxophonist, including a weekly gig at Gastown’s Classical Joint. Walker was a tireless supporter of the jazz scene on a grassroots level, which made him a regular at the Cellar Jazz/Cory’s Weeds’ Cellar Jazz Club.\nHe was perhaps best-known as the host of the long-running The Jazz Show on CiTR, which has been on the air since 1984.\nNardwuar the Human Serviette, who got to know Walker as a fellow CiTR host, told the Straight: “He was an absolute legend and I learned so much about Jazz from listening to his show. Such a huge loss. If not for Gavin I would know so much less. He was so good at what he did. He got people (like me!) to listen to jazz that they may not have otherwise!”\nVancouver photographer Gord McCaw, who’s been documenting Vancouver and its various music scenes since the late-’70s, told the Straight that Walker was a “kind, humble, witty as hell and a Gentleman...”\nNoting that they both worked as taxi drivers Black Top & Checker Cabs at one point in Vancouver, McCaw posted on Facebook: “I would see him around on the lot and we would trade jokes and scuttlebut of the taxi biz. Taxi driving was a good fit for misfits such as ourselves, in Gavin’s case an excellent alto horn player since the late 1950’s, in my case trying to pull something together as a freelance photographer. Most of the guys I knew in the biz were backstopping something else they’d rather be doing full time.”\nThat Walker never gave up jazz speaks volumes about his commitment to the genre he loved deeply.\nMcCaw noted that he reconnected with Walker after starting a Facebook group, and lunch meetups, for former taxi drivers.\n“Gavin was a charter member,” McCaw posted. “He had to bow out last month because he wasn’t feeling well, none of us knew in May that it was the last time we would see him. To say his loss will be deeply felt by all of us is an understatement. Rest well brother…”",

    "text": "Internacional El obispo auxiliar de Managua, monseñor Silvio Báez, en una fotografía de archivo. EFE/ Jorge Torres Obispo nicaragüense se declara indignado por la detención de tres sacerdotes de Managua\nBáez, quien reside en Miami y a quien las autoridades declararon “traidor a la patria” y despojaron de su nacionalidad, pidió a Dios proteger a los sacerdotes encarcelados\ndiciembre 28, 2023 El obispo auxiliar de Managua , Silvio Báez , a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, se declaró este jueves indignado por los arrestos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, en medio de tensiones entre el Gobierno del presidente Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica .\n“Me indigna el injusto secuestro de tres queridos sacerdotes de Managua de parte de la criminal dictadura sandinista: P. Pablo Villafranca , Mons. Carlos Avilés y P. Héctor Treminio , pastores y profetas”, escribió Báez , muy crítico con el Gobierno de Ortega en Nicaragua , en su cuenta del X (antes Twitter).\nBáez , quien reside en Miami y a quien las autoridades declararon “ traidor a la patria ” y despojaron de su nacionalidad, pidió a Dios proteger a los sacerdotes encarcelados y demandó que “sean liberados de inmediato”.\nLa Policía de Nicaragua detuvo este jueves a los sacerdores Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio , vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente. Días atrás también detuvo al párroco Pablo Villafranca.\nEl cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre la detención de sus tres sacerdotes.\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas, y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.\nEl Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por “traición a la patria”, tras negarse entonces a ser expulsado de Nicaragua hacia Estados Unidos junto a otros 222 presos políticos. También fue privado de su nacionalidad.\nOrtega ha calificado como una “ mafia ” a la Iglesia y ha declarado interrumpidas las relaciones con el Vaticano.\nNicaragua atraviesa una crisis política y social desde abril de 2018, que se ha acentuado tras las controvertidas elecciones generales del 7 de noviembre de 2021, en las que Ortega fue reelegido para un quinto mandato, cuarto consecutivo y segundo junto a su esposa, Rosario Murillo , como vicepresidenta, con sus principales contendientes en prisión.\nCon información de EFE",
