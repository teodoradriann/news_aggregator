    "title": "RTL Today - Fact Check: Hydrogen peroxide falsely promoted as cancer treatment",
    "text": "Hydrogen peroxide may be used for medical applications including disinfecting wounds and whitening teeth. However, claims made by Brian Ardis, a retired chiropractor, that the compound can treat cancer are false -- there is no evidence hydrogen peroxide can cure any type of cancer and ingesting the solution may be harmful or even fatal, health authorities say.\n\"You have to get the book 'The One-minute Cure,' and you need to start giving her food-grade hydrogen peroxide orally. It is known to cure almost every cancer on earth, and if you study with me, you'll learn why,\" Ardis says in a December 27, 2024 post on his show's Instagram page .\nThe 2008 book \" The One-minute Cure ,\" contends that most diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, can be cured with hydrogen peroxide therapy.\nArdis recommends cancer patients apply a nicotine patch and ingest about three to four drops of \"food grade\" hydrogen peroxide in eight fluid ounces of water daily, gradually increasing the dosage. He also gives the name of a company that sells hydrogen peroxide with a six percent concentration.\n© AFP\nThe same clip has circulated elsewhere on Instagram , Facebook , Threads , TikTok and Rumble -- including in Portuguese .\nMost household hydrogen peroxide found in US pharmacies has a concentration of around three percent. It is often sold in solutions used as disinfectants, deodorants, and hair-bleaching agents.\nBut claims that the solution can treat cancer are not backed by scientific research, and health authorities and experts warn that consuming it can be dangerous or potentially fatal.\nMedical professionals say drinking hydrogen peroxide could lead to cerebral or cardiac embolism or other serious consequences, and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warns that ingestion \"has been associated with fatalities (archived here ).\nThe CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says most hydrogen peroxide with a concentration of under nine percent is \"nontoxic\" but that any formula above three percent can cause vomiting and diarrhea. It can also be harmful to the skin and eyes.\nGarry Buettner , a professor at the University of Iowa School of Medicine who conducts research into cancer treatments (archived here ), said enzymes in the body would likely remove hydrogen peroxide from the system if a person drank only a few drops. In a January 1 email, he said that when he uses hydrogen peroxide as part of his oral care regimen, he rinses his mouth out \"immediately\" afterwards to avoid any unintended side effects.\nProponents of hydrogen peroxide therapy claim it can treat or cure cancer because it helps oxygenate the body and spur on natural immune processes. Some early animal-based studies seemed to support this hypothesis, but more recent research has called the method \"questionable\" (archived here and here ).\nA 2011 paper -- also an experiment that did not involve humans -- suggested cancer cells produce hydrogen peroxide to help them grow, meaning ingesting more of it could have the opposite of the intended effect (archived here ).\nBuettner said no formal studies in people have concluded that hydrogen peroxide can have a positive effect on cancer cells.\nDebunked source Ardis was disciplined by the Tennessee Department of Health in 2008 for failing to meet state educational requirements (archived here ). He has misleadingly asserted that cancers and other diseases are caused by toxins and parasites.\nDuring the pandemic, he spread the widely debunked theory that Covid-19 was a synthetic version of snake venom .\nAt the beginning of the clip, Ardis also references a doctor in Mexico named Antonio Jimenez, who markets \"alternative\" cancer treatments to US residents at two clinics in Tijuana and Cancún. In 2020, US prosecutors convicted a man for providing unapproved cancer drugs he made in his kitchen and warehouse to Jimenez's clinics (archived here and here ).\nA spokesperson for Jimenez's clinic told AFP in a December 30, 2024 email he does not support using hydrogen peroxide therapy.\nAFP has debunked other false claims about supposed cancer cures .\n<div",

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google https://policies.google.com/privacy and Terms of Service apply.\n“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history,” said filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, accepting the award for\nBest Documentary Feature for “ 20 Days in Mariupol,” onstage March 10 at the Dolby Theater. “I’m honored, but I will probably be the first director on this stage to say I wish I’d never made this film.”\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist captured the first three weeks of the deadly siege of the devastated Ukrainian port city for his Oscar-winning documentary. The strategic offensive, which lasted from February to May 2022, killed at least 8,000 people at the onset of the Russian invasion of\nUkraine.\n“I wish to be able to exchange this,” Chernov said, hoisting his Oscar, “to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities. I wish to give all the recognition to Russians now killing tens of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians. I wish for them to release all the hostages, all the soldiers who are protecting their lands, all the civilians who are now in their jails.”\nA new 200-page report detailing the events captured by “20 Days in Mariupol” spurred Human Rights Watch to call for further criminal prosecutions\njust last month. Attacks were waged in schools, hospitals, and other civilian sites; many surviving families are still searching for relatives.\n“I just want to remind that yesterday was an anniversary of an attack on the maternity hospital in Mariupol,” Chernov said, speaking to press in the winners’ room at the\nOscars. Asked about the metaphoric war between U.S. Congress and the White House over American funding for Ukraine’s defense, the director decried the use of his country as a “bargaining chip” in western politics.\n“This is not a political question,” Chernov said. “This is a humanitarian emergency.”\nRight now, Republicans are strongly resisting sending more aid while fighters run low on supplies and ammunition; military analysts across the globe have voiced concern that Russia will overrun remaining Ukrainian forces.\nChernov escaped the violence in Ukraine with 30 hours of video, using that material to make his Oscar-winning film; notably, one of the Russian airstrikes from the initial siege hit a theater in Mariupol where hundreds had sheltered. “20 Days in Mariupol” was also selected as the country’s official submission for Best International Feature; Ukraine has submitted in that category 15 other times and never won. (The Holocaust drama “Zone of Interest” made its own kind of history this year as the first British film to win the category.)\n“Great films will come out of Ukraine,” Chernov said backstage. “Great artists are there now working — or actually fighting. Great filmmakers are there now in the trenches, actually fighting for their country; so they cannot make movies. They cannot [currently] process what is happening to our history, what is happening to our people… but the time will come when more Ukrainians will make films, and I hope they will be inspired by our experience.”\nIt’s worth noting that films co-produced by Ukraine have received accolades from the Academy before, and that various artists born in the geographic area that is Ukraine have won Oscars. For example, composer Dimitri Tiomkin won four Oscars and was born in present-day Kremenchuk (a Ukrainian city), but would have identified during his life as Russian. Still, “20 Days in Mariupol” marks an essential victory\n“We can make sure the history record is set straight and the truth will prevail,” said Chernov. “And those who have given their lives will never be forgotten. Because cinema creates memories, and memories create history.”\nBy providing your information, you agree to our\nTerms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\nWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
