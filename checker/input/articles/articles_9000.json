Denmark: An arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) target of 60 mm Hg versus 90 mm Hg led to more days alive without support in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia, findings from HOT-COVID Randomized Clinical Trial have shown. The randomized trial, including 726 patients, found that targeting a Pao2 of 60 mm Hg resulted in 80.0 days alive without support at 90 days versus 72.0 days when targeting a Pao2 of 90 mm Hg. This difference was statistically significant. The findings were published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on March 19, 2024. COVID-19 pneumonia may result in hypoxemic respiratory failure needing high levels of supplemental oxygen and intensive care. Supplemental oxygen is ubiquitously used in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia, but there remains uncertainty about the effects of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies. To fill this knowledge gap, Frederik M. Nielsen, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark, and colleagues aimed to assess the effects of targeting a Pao2 of 60 mm Hg versus 90 mm Hg in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia in the ICU. For this purpose, the researchers conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial comprising 726 adults with COVID-19 receiving at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation across 11 ICUs in Europe from 2020 to 2023. The trial was stopped prematurely before the outcome assessment due to slow enrollment. The end of the 90-day follow-up was June 1, 2023. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a Pao2 of 60 mm Hg (lower oxygenation group; n = 365) or 90 mm Hg (higher oxygenation group; n = 361) for up to 90 days in the ICU. The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (kidney replacement therapy, circulatory support, or mechanical ventilation) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included a proportion of patients with serious adverse events, mortality, and number of days alive and out of hospital, all at 90 days. The following were the study’s key findings: - Of 726 randomized patients, primary outcome data were available for 697 (351 in the lower oxygenation group and 346 in the higher oxygenation group). The median age was 66 years, and 68% of patients were male. - At 90 days, the median number of days alive without life support was 80.0 days in the lower oxygenation group and 72.0 days in the higher oxygenation group. - Mortality at 90 days was 30.2% in the lower oxygenation group and 34.7% in the higher oxygenation group (risk ratio, 0.86). - There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with serious adverse events or the number of days alive and out of hospital. \"Targeting a Pao2 of 60 mm Hg resulted in more days alive without life support over 90 days than targeting a Pao2 of 90 mm Hg in adult patients in the ICU with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia,\" the researchers concluded.

    "text": "Prince William has vowed to do, not just preach, by building dozens more homes for the homeless on his own Duchy of Cornwall estate. The heir to the throne is currently marking a year since he launched his Homewards project to end the scourge of rough sleeping, sofa surfing and families living in often sub-standard temporary accommodation in six key areas across the UK. He is already working with the charity St Petrocs in Cornwall to provide 24 homes with wrap-around support for local people experiencing homelessness at Nansledan. And now sources have told the Mail that William is taking an &#039;active role&#039; in developing additional housing projects across his estate, which accounts for 52,449 hectares across 20 counties in the UK. It is understood that he strongly believes he must lead from the front given his position of immense privilege as Prince of Wales. Prince William (pictured on Thursday) has vowed to build dozens more homes for the homeless on his own Duchy of Cornwall estate The heir to the throne is currently marking a year since he launched his Homewards project to end the scourge of rough sleeping in six key areas across the UK He is already working with the charity St Petrocs in Cornwall to provide 24 homes with wrap-around support for local people experiencing homelessness at Nansledan While his decision to build more affordable homes is not a political one, it does chime with the new Labour government&#039;s mission on house building. Read More Hopes Kate will attend Wimbledon finals while William flies to Berlin for Euro 2024 final In a speech during a visit to Brixton, south London, William argued that for too long homelessness had been seen as &#039;inevitable&#039;. &#039;Homelessness is a complex societal issue and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended,&#039; he said. Local experts - ranging from house builders and local authorities to private rental firms and charities - are being helped to work together to find solutions to ultimately eradicate homelessness in all its forms. The Prince told guests at the event, who were drawn from the charity sector, local authorities, as well as those who have experienced homelessness, that their success so far was a &#039;powerful reminder to everyone of what can be achieved when we work together towards a shared goal&#039;. Prince William told guests that their success so far is a &#039;powerful reminder to everyone of what can be achieved when we work together towards a shared goal&#039; In a speech during a visit to Brixton, south London, William argued that for too long homelessness had been seen as &#039;inevitable&#039; The Prince said of people who apparently slip through the system: &#039;We&#039;ve got to make sure we don&#039;t overlook them&#039; &#039;So many people are doing brilliant work and have been doing it for years and years. We want you to feel that this [Homewards] is a resource and support for you,&#039; he said. The Prince also spoke of his concerns about people slipping through the cracks in society, saying: &#039;We&#039;ve got to make sure we don&#039;t overlook them. Find families early enough and work with them. &#039;If you&#039;re parenting on our own without a village, you&#039;re set up to fail.&#039; Read More Prince William apologies for loss of voice after England&amp;#x27;s semi-final as he visits Lambeth The event included a &#039;fireside chat&#039; with Homewards advocate Sabrina Hatton Cohen, and Chris Lynam from the Sheffield coalition who shared his story of childhood abuse, followed by PTSD from his time in the Navy and his journey from being a &#039;homeless heroin addict eating from bins&#039; to one of Homewards&#039; &#039;lived experience advocates&#039;. William added: &#039;I created Homewards because I wanted us to look at the issue of homelessness through a different lens: to inspire a movement to prevent people from ever experiencing homelessness in the first place. &#039;I know this will take a huge effort. And I know that demonstrating that homelessness is not an inevitable part of our society will take time. &#039;I have, though, been struck by the scale of the work that has been carried out since the launch of Homewards and I hope it is a powerful reminder to everyone of what can be achieved when we work together. &#039;The energy and enthusiasm that each individual and organisation is bringing to the programme, and to showing that it is possible to end homelessness in their local area, is inspiring and I know, together, we can do this.&#039;",

    "text": "Earth recorded its hottest year ever in 2024, with such a big jump that the planet temporarily passed a major climate threshold, several weather monitoring agencies announced Friday.Last year's global average temperature easily passed 2023's record heat and kept pushing even higher. It surpassed the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 1800s that was called for by the 2015 Paris climate pact, according to the European Commission's Copernicus Climate Service, the United Kingdom's Meteorology Office and Japan 's weather agency. The European team calculated 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.89 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. Japan found 1.57 degrees Celsius (2.83 degrees Fahrenheit) and the British 1.53 degrees Celsius (2.75 degrees Fahrenheit) in releases of data coordinated to early Friday morning European time. American monitoring teams — NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the private Berkeley Earth — were to release their figures later Friday but all will likely show record heat for 2024, European scientists said. The six groups compensate for data gaps in observations that go back to 1850 — in different ways, which is why numbers vary slightly.“The primary reason for these record temperatures is the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere” from the burning of coal, oil and gas, said Samantha Burgess, strategic climate lead at Copernicus. “As greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, temperatures continue to increase, including in the ocean, sea levels continue to rise, and glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt.”Last year eclipsed 2023's temperature in the European database by an eighth of a degree Celsius (more than a fifth of a degree Fahrenheit). That's an unusually large jump; until the last couple of super-hot years, global temperature records were exceeded only by hundredths of a degree, scientists said. The last 10 years are the 10 hottest on record and are likely the hottest in 125,000 years, Burgess said.July 10 was the hottest day recorded by humans, with the globe averaging 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.89 degrees Fahrenheit), Copernicus found.By far the biggest contributor to record warming is the burning of fossil fuels, several scientists said. A temporary natural El Nino warming of the central Pacific added a small amount and an undersea volcanic eruption in 2022 ended up cooling the atmosphere because it put more reflecting particles in the atmosphere as well as water vapor, Burgess said. Alarm bells are ringing “This is a warning light going off on the Earth’s dashboard that immediate attention is needed,'' said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. ”Hurricane Helene, floods in Spain and the weather whiplash fueling wildfires in California are symptoms of this unfortunate climate gear shift. We still have a few gears to go.\"\"Climate-change-related alarm bells have been ringing almost constantly, which may be causing the public to become numb to the urgency, like police sirens in New York City,\" Woodwell Climate Research Center scientist Jennifer Francis said. \"In the case of the climate, though, the alarms are getting louder, and the emergencies are now way beyond just temperature.”The world incurred $140 billion in climate-related disaster losses last year — third highest on record — with North America especially hard hit, according to a report by the insurance firm Munich Re.“The acceleration of global temperature increases means more damage to property and impacts on human health and the ecosystems we depend on,” said University of Arizona water scientist Kathy Jacobs. World breaches major threshold This is the first time any year passed the 1.5-degree threshold, except for a 2023 measurement by Berkeley Earth, which was originally funded by philanthropists who were skeptical of global warming.Scientists were quick to point out that the 1.5 goal is for long-term warming, now defined as a 20-year average. Warming since pre-industrial times over the long term is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Celsius). “The 1.5 degree C threshold isn’t just a number — it’s a red flag. Surpassing it even for a single year shows how perilously close we are to breaching the limits set by the Paris Agreement,” Northern Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini said in an email. A 2018 massive United Nations study found that keeping Earth's temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius could save coral reefs from going extinct, keep massive ice sheet loss in Antarctica at bay and prevent many people's death and suffering. Francis called the threshold “dead in the water.” Burgess called it extremely likely that Earth will overshoot the 1.5-degree threshold, but called the Paris Agreement “extraordinarily important international policy” that nations around the world should remain committed to. More warming is likely European and British calculations figure with a cooling La Nina instead of last year's warming El Nino, 2025 is likely to be not quite as hot as 2024. They predict it will turn out to be the third-warmest. However, the first six days of January — despite frigid temperatures in the U.S. East — averaged slightly warmer and are the hottest start to a year yet, according to Copernicus data.Scientists remain split on whether global warming is accelerating. There's not enough data to see an acceleration in atmospheric warming, but the heat content of the oceans seem to be not just rising but going up at a faster rate, said Carlo Buontempo, Copernicus' director.“We are facing a very new climate and new challenges — climate challenges that our society is not prepared for,” Buontempo said.This is all like watching the end of “a dystopian sci-fi film,” said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. “We are now reaping what we've sown.”___Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment___Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears",
