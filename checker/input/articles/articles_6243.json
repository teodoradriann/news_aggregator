    "text": "IMAGE: MIDJOURNEY Ascension, one of the largest U.S. healthcare systems, revealed that a May 2024 ransomware attack was caused by an employee who downloaded a malicious file onto a company device.\nAscension says this was likely an \"honest mistake\" as the employee thought they were downloading a legitimate file.\nThe attack impacted the MyChart electronic health records system, phones, and systems used to order tests, procedures, and medications, prompting the healthcare giant to take some devices offline on May 8 to contain what it described at the time as a \"cyber security event,\"\nThis forced employees to keep track of procedures and medications on paper, as they could no longer access patient records electronically.\nAscension also paused some non-emergent elective procedures, tests, and appointments and diverted emergency medical services to other healthcare units to avoid triage delays.\nOn Wednesday, it said that some of its services are still being impacted, and the healthcare system is still working on bringing some electronic health records systems, patient portals, and phone systems, as well as tests, procedures, and medication ordering systems online.\nIt also added that an ongoing investigation found evidence the threat actors only gained access to and stole files from seven out of thousands of servers on its network.\n\"At this point, we now have evidence that indicates that the attackers were able to take files from a small number of file servers used by our associates primarily for daily and routine tasks. These servers represent seven of the approximately 25,000 servers across our network,\" an Ascension spokesperson said .\n\"Though we are still investigating, we believe some of those files may contain Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for certain individuals, although the specific data may differ from individual to individual.\"\nHowever, Ascension says it has yet to find proof that the attackers stole data from its Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical systems, which store the full patient records.\nRansomware attack linked to Black Basta While the healthcare giant has yet to link the attack to a specific ransomware operation, CNN reported that the Black Basta gang is behind the incident.\nDays after the attack, Health-ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) also issued a threat bulletin warning that Black Basta \"has recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.\"\nSince it surfaced in April 2022, Black Basta's affiliates have breached the networks of many high-profile victims, including Rheinmetall , Capita , ABB , and the Toronto Public Library .\nJoint research from Elliptic and Corvus Insurance also revealed the gang made over $100 million from 90+ victims until November 2023.\nAs one of the largest nonprofit health networks in the U.S., Ascension operates 140 hospitals and 40 senior care facilities, and it reported a total revenue of $28.3 billion in 2023.\nAscension also employs 8,500 providers and has 35,000 affiliated providers and 134,000 associates across 19 states and the District of Columbia.\nRelated Articles: Ascension redirects ambulances after suspected ransomware attack\nAscension healthcare takes systems offline after cyberattack\nLondon hospitals cancel over 800 operations after ransomware attack\nNew York Times warns freelancers of GitHub repo data breach\nLondon hospitals face blood shortage after Synnovis ransomware attack",

    "text": "A historic agreement by the U.S. Department of the Interior with the Klamath Water Users Association, Klamath Tribes, Yurok Tribe and Karuk Tribe was announced Wednesday.\nDuring a news conference with an Interior department official in Washington, D.C., it was announced the water users and tribes have agreed to “advance collaborative efforts to restore the Klamath Basin ecosystem and improve water supply reliability for Klamath Project agriculture.”\nOfficials said more than $72 million in new investments, including funding from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, will be used for ecosystem restoration and agricultural infrastructure modernization.\n“The collaboration and cooperation reached today in the Klamath Basin is a critical step forward as we work to support healthy ecosystems and water reliability in the region for generations to come,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a news release.\n“Following months of consultation and discussions, we’re proud to formalize this partnership with Tribes and irrigators and make a shared commitment that will benefit the forests, watersheds, agriculture and abundant populations of migratory bird and fish species that are unique to this Basin. With new resources from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we’re able to make immediate investments that will benefit the communities and wildlife that call this place home.”\nAs part of Wednesday’s announcements, the Interior Department also announced the Klamath Basin Drought Resilience Keystone Initiative, which it said will “support a wide range of restoration activities that will help recover listed species, create new habitat for fish and birds, and rethink the way water moves across the Klamath Basin to better align agriculture with ecosystem function.”\nThe initiative is one of nine key conservation areas the Department is “focusing resources through a new restoration and resilience framework, and comes at a critical time as the removal of four dams on the Klamath River is underway.”\nWednesday’s announcements are not directly related to removal of the four Klamath River dams but stem from ongoing collaboration efforts among the various groups, officials said.\nAccording to the agency, the newly signed Memorandum of Understanding “commits the parties to working together to identify, recommend and support projects that advance shared Klamath Basin restoration goals, including improving water and irrigation stability and reliability; strengthening ecosystem resilience; protecting fish populations; and advancing drought resilience.\nThe MOU also “commits the Department of the Interior to working across its bureaus, other federal departments and agencies, the states of Oregon and California, and non-governmental partners to help secure funding and approval for projects and actions that advance these shared goals, including new investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.”\nThe agreement also “formally recognizes the significant value of Indigenous knowledge and commits the parties to incorporate it into its restoration efforts throughout the Basin.”\nAccording to Interior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will dedicate $64 million for work to “restore the regional ecosystem and repair local economies in the coming years. This investment will fully fund completion of the Klamath Falls National Fish Hatchery by 2027, focus on innovative collaborative conservation in the Sprague River watershed, and continue implementation of Tribally led projects throughout the Basin.”\nAs part of the investment, $25 million will be made available for “co-developed restoration projects in the Klamath Basin that will help resolve ongoing water-related challenges and invest in water stability and restoration efforts throughout the region.” The full project list is on the FWS website.\nFWS will provide $4 million to support the 14,000-acre Agency-Barnes wetland restoration project at Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge, and $1.8 million to “support a feasibility analysis of modifications to water supply infrastructure in Klamath Drainage District to benefit wildlife, farms and fish, including endangered sucker fish.\nIn addition, in the coming year FWS will coordinate with Klamath Basin conservation partners “to develop a conservation and restoration project database and interactive map. This tool will track and describe conservation work in the Klamath Basin for the public and help to coordinate restoration efforts among partners in the Basin. It will also house and provide access to important data sets that can help drive long-term restoration success and support science and research efforts.”\nThe announcement also said the Bureau of Reclamation is “establishing a robust drought resilience program for basins experiencing long-term drought and the impacts of climate change – including throughout the Klamath Basin. In the coming months, Reclamation will announce significant additional funding throughout the region to facilitate multi-year planning and alignment of water supply and demand as well as to address critical infrastructure needs.”\nReclamation is also providing $2.9 million to the Klamath Tribes, Yurok Tribe, Hoopa Valley Tribe, Karuk Tribe and Modoc Nation for projects “that restore watersheds and revitalize water infrastructures.”\n“There’s a lot going on in the Klamath Basin,” the Interior spokesman said. We’re making great strides but there’s still a lot to do.”\nwww.bendbulletin.com/subscribe-now.",
