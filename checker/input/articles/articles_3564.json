The squad faces off against more than 60 other teams in Class 4A Division I on Friday.\n“I feel excited and ready for them to go out there and show all the hard work that they’ve put into it,” head cheer coach Alyssa Canales told DailyTrib.com. “I know our girls can give anyone a run for their money.”\nThe Marble Falls cheerleaders placed second in their last two competitions, most recently at the Lago Vista Game Day Invitational in late December.\n“(The state championship is) definitely a tough competition, but we’ve been working our butts off since November putting together our team, choreographing stunts and jumps, and getting in the gym at 6:45 a.m. every day,” cheerleader Ella Shreve said. “It’s definitely nerve-wracking, but we would love to have everyone we can there supporting us.”\nPurchase tickets to attend the UIL spirit state championship online.

    "title": "Sumar demanded that Errejón resign after he admitted “sexist behavior”",
    "text": "It all broke out on Tuesday morning. The journalist Cristina Fallarás made public some anonymous messages that denounced that a “well-known politician from Madrid” was a “psychological abuser” and a “true monster.” And the snowball began to grow inside Sumar. Although these messages did not explicitly mention Íñigo Errejón, everyone in the coalition led by Yolanda Díaz understood that they were referring to him. And the movements began.\nDeputies of the parliamentary group in Congress, workers and party colleagues from Errejón in Más Madrid demanded that the accusations not fall on deaf ears this time. Because it wasn’t the first time something like this happened. And because on this occasion, despite the fact that no criminal act was detailed, it was decided that the complaint exceeded the limits of what was acceptable for the parliamentary spokesperson of a political group that defends a left-wing and feminist project.\nWith the case becoming a real internal fire, Errejón tried to avoid the cameras, microphones and journalists of Congress on Wednesday morning during the control session. In fact, the deputy did not enter through the usual hallway leading to the chamber. But that day the Minister of Housing also appeared and Sumar entrusted her with attending the press to react to the proposals that Isabel Rodríguez had put on the table and to outline the line of her group. At the request of Sumar’s former spokesperson, this attention to the press occurred far from the usual place. Specifically, one floor above the entrance to the chamber, in front of the Constitutional Chamber.\nBut at that time there were already many people determined to go to the end. The Executive of Más Madrid, a party that he founded, met urgently and conveyed to Yolanda Díaz the demand for Errejón’s immediate dismissal. Several Sumar leaders then contacted the spokesperson seeking explanations. According to all the sources consulted and aware of these conversations, Errejón admitted his sexist behavior but flatly denied having committed any criminal act.\nAfter acknowledging these accusations, Yolanda Díaz contacted him this Thursday morning. On an official trip to Bogotá, the second vice president demanded that she present her resignation immediately. And he informed him that, if not, the alternative would be his dismissal. Errejón, who could not guarantee his party that more accusations of this type would not come to light from now on, accepted his resignation in that conversation with Díaz.\nThings, then, precipitated at noon on Thursday. Sumar Movement called an emergency executive. The management decided to accept the resignation and asked Errejón to wait until the end of the meeting to release the statement. It didn’t happen. After 2:30 p.m., the former deputy published a letter on the networks full of euphemisms.\n“I have reached the limit of the contradiction between the character and the person,” he said in a letter in which he did not refer to the accusations against him but in which he left some justifications for behaviors that he associates with patriarchy.\n“On the political and media front line you survive and are more effective, at least that has been my case, with a way of behaving that is often emancipated from care, empathy and the needs of others. This generates a toxic subjectivity that in the case of men, patriarchy multiplies, with co-workers, with organizational colleagues, with emotional relationships and even with oneself,” reads the text published in their X profile.\nA few hours later, Sumar released the statement summarizing the management. “This morning, Íñigo Errejón sent the Sumar executive the statement that he had just made public, presenting his irrevocable resignation as a member of the executive, deputy and spokesperson for the Plurinational Parliamentary Group of Sumar. The executive of Movimiento Sumar met immediately and, after having listened to the reasons given by Íñigo Errejón, has unanimously accepted his resignation,” says the statement sent by the management.\nElizabeth Duval, Secretary of Communication for Movimiento Sumar, later explained the sequence of events on Hora 25. “On Tuesday we met an anonymous person from Cristina Fallarás, from there we started an investigation, we asked Íñigo himself for explanations and that led to his resignation,” he explained, in an interview in which he stated that Errejón recognized “sexist behavior.” ”.\n“This behavior has no place in a training that is considered feminist. We have to see if there are other cases, if there are cases beyond more anonymous complaints. From there we have made the statement we have made,” said Duval. “We considered that these behaviors were intolerable and given the facts that he recognized, there was no other option,” he added.\nLate on Thursday, actress and presenter Elisa Mouliaá became the first woman to publicly report being a victim of sexual harassment by Sumar’s former spokesperson. “Hello, I am a victim of sexual harassment by Iñigo Errejon and I want to report it,” he published.\nDuring the afternoon, the leaders of Sumar’s parties have been demonstrating in public. Yolanda Díaz has stated that the resignation was the result of the internal investigation. Ministers such as Ernest Urtasun, Sira Rego or leaders such as the spokesperson for Más Madrid in the assembly, Manuela Bergerot, have criticized his behavior and defended his resignation. “Our commitment against machismo and for a feminist society is firm and without exceptions,” concluded the second vice president of the Government.\n#Sumar #demanded #Errejón #resign #admitted #sexist #behavior",

    "title": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham | The Independent",
    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.His West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "text": "In Thüringen sinkt wie in anderen ostdeutschen Bundesländern die Zahl der Kindergartenkinder. Mancherorts werden schon Einrichtungen geschlossen. Die Linke fordert ein Umsteuern.\nAnzeige Die Thüringer Linke-Fraktion hat ein Personal-Moratorium für Kindergärten gefordert, damit keine Erzieherinnen und Erzieher entlassen werden. «Ein Moratorium, wie der Freistaat Sachsen es gemacht hat, dass bis zum 31.12.2026 keine Erzieherinnen entlassen werden», sagte die Linke-Bildungspolitikerin Ulrike Grosse-Röthig.\nHintergrund sind massiv sinkende Kinderzahlen in den Einrichtungen des Landes aufgrund des demografischen Wandels. In etlichen Kommunen werden Kindergärten geschlossen, teils setzen Träger Fachkräfte bei den Wochenarbeitsstunden herunter.\nAnzeige «Kein Kindergarten kostet mehr, nur weil weniger Kinder drin sind», sagte Grosse-Röthig. Nur die Einnahmen aus Elternbeiträgen würden sinken. «Und da sind wir als Land in der Pflicht.»\nLinke: Kindergarten im Dorf lassen Die Linke-Fraktion fordert in einem Maßnahmen-Papier zur frühkindlichen Bildung ein «Kindergarten-im Dorf-Gesetz». Damit sollen Kindergärten erhalten bleiben, auch wenn sie künftig nicht die geforderte Mindestkinderzahl erreichen. «Dazu gehört, dass Einnahmeausfälle durch demografischen Wandel ausgeglichen werden und damit der Kindergarten buchstäblich im Dorf bleiben kann», heißt es in dem Papier.\nAnzeige Die stark sinkenden Kinderzahlen sind schon seit längerem bekannt. Mit einer Änderung des Betreuungsschlüssels noch unter der rot-rot-grünen Minderheitsregierung sollten die Folgen daraus abgemildert und Arbeitsplätze in den Einrichtungen gesichert werden.\nEine Erzieherin oder ein Erzieher muss sich nach dem neuen Betreuungsschlüssel um weniger Kinder gleichzeitig kümmern als bisher. Die Änderung gilt seit Anfang des Jahres. Für die Umsetzung haben Kommunen eine Übergangszeit. Nach Angaben des Bildungsministeriums von Ende Mai setzt knapp die Hälfte der Einrichtungen die neuen Vorgaben um.\ndpa-infocom GmbH",

    "text": "Lisboa, 5 sep (EFE).- El seleccionador de Portugal, Roberto Martínez, se mostró este jueves, tras la victoria (2-1) de Portugal ante Croacia en la fase previa de la Liga de las Naciones, \"muy satisfecho y contento\" y aseguró que el encuentro fue \"una batalla táctica\".\nPara el seleccionador, en declaraciones a los medios de comunicación tras el partido, Portugal \"jugó muy bien y con superioridad en los primeros 40 minutos\".\nLa segunda parte \"fue un juego más equilibrado\", donde Portugal supo sufrir y defender a Croacia.\n\"Sufrimos para ganar\", insistió el técnico español, aunque \"eso forma parte de los valores de un equipo ganador\".\nSobre el gol 900 en la carrera de Cristiano Ronaldo, que anotó el segundo del partido para Portugal, Roberto Martínez declaró a los periodistas que \"Cristiano siempre da que hablar\".\nLo importante, a juicio de Roberto Martínez, es el \"compromiso con la selección de Cristiano, es un ejemplo, es un jugador muy inteligente en el área y hoy ha mostrado eso\".\nMartínez también tuvo palabras de recuerdo y elogio para el central Pepe, que acaba de colgar las botas y que antes del partido fue homenajeado por la Federación Portuguesa de Fútbol (FPF).
