    "text": "El expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont ha celebrado este viernes el regreso a Cataluña de la secretaria general de ERC, Marta Rovira: \"Con el retorno de los exiliados perseguidos por la gran farsa judicial que ha sido el caso Tsunami se acaba una injusticia\". Marta Rovira ha entrado ya en Cataluña desde la frontera francesa que da acceso a La Jonquera (Girona) tras más de seis años residiendo en Suiza huida de la justicia española por el procés, así como el diputado Rubén Wagensberg; el vicepresidente primero de Òmnium Cultural, Oleguer Serra; el empresario Josep Campmajó y el periodista Jesús Rodríguez. \"Con exiliados, encarcelados y perseguidos no se puede hacer política en igualdad de condiciones. Esto afecta a la democracia, y mientras dure la represión política no existirá ninguna normalidad posible\", ha añadido Puigdemont en X. El expresidente de la Generalitat, que se encuentra en Bruselas (Bélgica) desde otoño de 2017, todavía no puede regresar a Cataluña con garantías de no ser detenido después de que el Tribunal Supremo haya decidido no aplicarle la ley de amnistía, si bien ha asegurado que estará presente en el primer debate de investidura que se celebre en el Parlament. A pesar del regreso de Rovira, Puigdemont considera que el independentismo todavía está \"lejos\" de tener \"las condiciones que permitan hacer política con normalidad\". \"Que de alguna manera podáis recuperar los años y los meses que os han robado, y que nos pongamos a trabajar lo más rápido posible. Porque hay mucho trabajo pendiente\", ha expresado. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",

    "title": "Ja’Marr Chase has disrespectful take on Chiefs’ defense",
    "text": "Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase is not exactly showing a lot of respect for the Kansas City Chiefs’ defense ahead of their meeting on Sunday. Chase was dismissive of the Chiefs’ talent, admitting that they run a lot of double teams and are good at nullifying Cincinnati’s strengths. He implied that scheme was the reason for their success against the Bengals, and argued that they lack any real impact talent on that side of the ball. “It’s not like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad,” Chase said. Chase shrugged off the prospect of the Chiefs using his comments as motivation. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care,” Chase said. “That’s why they double everybody. Because they can’t do it one-on-one.” Chase isn’t necessarily wrong about the Chiefs lacking big names on defense, particularly in the secondary. However, top cornerback L’Jarius Sneed has had an excellent season, and Chase did acknowledge him as the best player in that unit. The Chiefs and Bengals have developed a strong rivalry in recent years. There may have been some worries that this game might not be quite as intense with the Chiefs struggling and Joe Burrow sidelined for the Bengals, but Chase is doing his part to ensure that is not the case.

    "text": "(Adnkronos) - La bara bianca con i fiori bianchi, rosa e celesti e nastrini rossi sugli abiti degli amici, grido muto contro i femminicidi. Oggi a Castelfranco Veneto è il giorno dei funerali di Vanessa Ballan, la 26enne incinta di tre mesi, uccisa a coltellate, il 19 dicembre, nella sua abitazione nel trevigiano da Bujar Fandaj, 41enne kosovaro che lei aveva denunciato per stalking.\nA seguire l'ingresso del feretro il marito Nicola, i genitori e gli amici più cari. All'interno del duomo, tra i molti conoscenti e amici, anche il governatore del Veneto Luca Zaia.\n“La vita è stata travolta da una tragedia che non ha senso. Troppo grande quello che è successo, è al di fuori della più pessimistica previsione\". \"Non c'è un motivo al mondo che giustifichi questo atto, questa violenza. Non c'è mai. Non c'è sicuramente nel caso di Vanessa - ha aggiunto - e della creatura che portava in grembo. Non c'è un senso nella sua brutale uccisione. Questo è il male. E con il male non possiamo, non abbiamo il diritto di venire a patti\". Monsignor Tomasi ha chiesto \"il silenzio dai clamori e dalle curiosità ma mai della ricerca della giustizia - ha ribadito - e nemmeno il silenzio nell'impegno per una civiltà che rifiuti nelle parole, negli atti e nei fatti la violenza sulle donne, e che superi finalmente la follia di voler possedere una persona, o di volerne determinare con la violenza le scelte e le decisioni\".\n“Ricordiamo Vanessa col sorriso, resta stampato in tutti noi. Ricordo quando è rimasta incinta, sperava tanto di avere questo bambino”, racconta fuori dal duomo, una collega della vittima. Il suo assassino “passava al supermercato - racconta la ragazza - ma faceva anche la spesa, era un cliente abituale. L’ho visto sabato l’ultima volta. La cercava. Avevamo paura, perché si vedeva dalla faccia, è uno di cui non ti fidi già dallo sguardo”. “Se avessimo potuto far qualcosa - dice con gli occhi lucidi - lo avremmo fatto. Ma Vanessa non ci aveva detto nulla. Se lei ci avesse chiesto anche di denunciare, lo avremmo fatto. E tanto, pure se lo avessimo fatto, magari non serviva. Abbiamo tanta rabbia - dice - perché non doveva succedere. Mi chiedo ancora a cosa servano le leggi”.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\n'We're ready to battle': Oilers visit Flames seeking Canadian-record 13th-straight win\nBattle of Alberta, Saturday on Hockey Night in Canada, and a Canadian NHL team record on the line in Calgary.\nIt doesn't get much better than that for hockey fans on a chilly January night, as the Oilers face off against the Flames, for 13 straight wins.\n\"They're always motivated to beat the Edmonton Oilers. And we're always motivated to beat the Calgary Flames,\" Edmonton head coach Kris Knobaluch said Friday.\n\"But now, with our streak and them chasing us in the playoffs there will probably be even more of a rivalry. It'll be great.\"\nWith a 4-2 victory over the Seattle Kraken Thursday, Edmonton has won 12 in a row.\nThat has them tied with the 1967-68 Montreal Canadiens for the most ever by a Canadian NHL franchise.\nThe 1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins hold the all-time NHL record with 17 consecutive wins.\n\"I'll be honest. I don't really care about the streak. I just want to win,\" defenceman Vincent Desharnais told reporters ahead of the trip to Calgary.\n\"We just want to go in there, get two points, and get out of there. We know it's going to be a big rivalry. We're excited for it. We're ready to battle.\"\nThe Flames are also a tough team to beat lately. Calgary has won seven of their last 10 contests and sits just four points back of Edmonton.\n\"It's a divisional game and a building that's hard to play in. So for us, it's going to take everyone to come out with a good team effort,\" defenceman Darnell Nurse said.\n\"They're a good team, playing some pretty good hockey right now too, so for us it's not going to be an easy task.\"\nSniper Leon Draisaitl said the Oilers always get \"amped up\" to play the Flames but have to stay focused.\n\"We have the chance to make history and we are aware of it. At the same time, we're still just looking to play our game,\" he told reporters.\n\"Right now, we're in the moment and we're just looking to get better and bank more points.\"\nWhile the Oilers have fallen down 2-0 the past two games, Knoblauch said he's been impressed with his players' resolve to stick with their game plan, remain positive, and give and accept constructive criticism.\n\"I think maturity is easy when things are going well. Right now things are going pretty well,\" he said.\n\"We'll see how mature we are when things do get rocky and things are harder and things just aren't going our way. That's really the test of a true mature team.\"\nEdmonton's hot streak has propelled them to sixth in the Western Conference, while their provincial rivals are ninth.\nThe Oilers and Flames faceoff in Calgary shortly after 8 p.m. Saturday on CBC.\nEdmonton Top Stories\nCTVNews.ca Top Stories\nLoblaw 50 per cent off stickers to return after public anger over discount reduction\nLoblaw Cos.

Entonces, va a entrar de Estados Unidos y luego al regreso va a pagar. Va afectar mucho a la industria, en nuestro país porque se corre riesgo de disminuir la manufactura”.\nLa presidenta de la Canacintra pidió hacer un frente común con el gobierno de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum. Reconoció que buscar otros horizontes, mercados de exportación, no es tan rápido, pero sí acelerar las estrategias para no dejar de ser un país manufacturero y mirar hacia otros mercados.\n“Esto para mí, en ese momento fue así como una cubetada de agua, porque estábamos esperando el 2 (de abril), pero no llegó el 2, estamos a 26 (de marzo). Entonces, trabajaremos, ahorita me pondré en contacto con el presidente del sector automotriz, buscaremos al presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Autopartes y pues ver qué hacer en conjunto porque todos somos una sola parte”.\nLa Canacintra forma parte de la cadena de valor. “Tenemos el sector automotriz, de remolques, y también por nuestra parte se hacen autopartes, se genera mucha más de obra especializada”, afirmó Esperanza Ortega.\nLas nuevas reglas de comercio con Estados Unidos “sí es preocupante en este momento lo que está sucediendo”.",
