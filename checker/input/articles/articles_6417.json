    "text": "Since opening in 2023, EJI Health has provided free health services to hundreds of people across Alabama. Many patients were previously incarcerated and received no personal medical care while in jail or prison. The Montgomery Advertiser recognized the impact of the EJI Health Clinic and EJI's mobile clinic, which provides care to patients outside Montgomery, in a recent article. Alabama's health crisis Millions of people in Alabama do not have health insurance and access to health care remains a serious problem. Formerly incarcerated people are particularly vulnerable, and many coming out of prisons and jails suffer from undiagnosed illnesses that can seriously compromise their health and successful re-entry. While EJI's health clinic prioritizes care for incarcerated people, it is open to anyone unable to access health care by other means. “A Lifesaver” Montgomery native Leonard Pettiway, 67, who was released from prison earlier this year, was one of EJI Health's first patients. He described the care he received while incarcerated as one-size-fits-all care, which often left him without treatment. “When I was in jail, I did not get any help. He kept track of my illness all these years,” Mr. Pettiway said. “This place, it's a lifesaver. You will regret not being able to stand on your feet after running in this place. EJI physicians helped treat Mr. Pettiway's hepatitis C and provided him with the medications he needed to address other health problems. The EJI Health team is eager to reach more people like Mr. Pettiway, including with services offered from the EJI Mobile Clinic, which the team has delivered to day reporting centers across the state. “This is about improving outcomes for people coming out of jails and prisons, as well as improving public safety and improving public health,” EJI Director Brian Stevenson said of the project. “I think we're going to be able to establish that people who use these services, people who get the health treatment that they need, will have a much lower rate of recidivism than people who Don't do that.” For questions about patient eligibility and appointments, you can call EJI Health at (334)239-9740 or email (email protected) at",

    "text": "Campus Life\nJuly 31, 2025 by\nOur Reporter\nFoundation, Google train visually-impaired students, others on AI, Android tools\nBy Abike Sanusi\nThe Christ’s Outreach on Disabilities (CODISA) Foundation has partnered Google to train over 30 visually-impaired students including those from University of Lagos (UNILAG), National Association of Visually-Impaired Students (University of Lagos Chapter), Anglo Nigerian Welfare Association for the Blind, Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind and other individuals empowered by the foundation.\nThe training was on effective use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Android devices to improve their lives and make them less dependent.\nGoogle staff,CODISA members and other visually- impaired individuals attended the training.\nSpeaking at the event, Codisa Leader Prince Olaoluwa Awojoodu, noted that the training was informed by the need to assist visually- impaired individuals to be independent and improve their access to general services.\n“This training is for the visually-impaired for the Android device. So, for example, if I’m going to train someone that is hearing-impaired, it will not be the same training, because they can see the Android phone, these ones cannot see it.\nSo it’s about how do they attain effective use, that’s the focus of this training,” he said.\nHe underscored the commitment of the foundation to transforming lives, stating that it had impacted over 10,000 people that have special needs since it was established in 1984.\n“So we deal with 40 homes as of today. We have 40 homes that we sponsor and we have been doing this for over 40 years,” he added.\nDirector Google West Africa Region,Olumide Balogun, expressed delight to be in partnership with CODISA to carry out the technology training to help visually-impaired persons to have access to their phone, artificial intelligence in a way that it can benefit their life, their purpose and by extension, the society.\n“The team here at Google, we’re always looking for where we can really step in and support and make a meaningful difference.\n“So Google Serve is an activity that we carry out every year. Where we think about our communities and say, where can we serve? Where can we go physically, not just from the office, but where can we go physically and serve.\nAnd for us, you know, we just thought it was a natural fit for us to come and spend time with our brothers and our sisters and really bring the power of technology to them.\nSo we’re very excited to be here doing this training today,” he said.\nGoogle Search Partnerships Lead for Sub-Saharan Africa, Ugochi Agoreyo, who took the group through sessions on utilising their phones and AI effectively, explained that\nRead Also: New dawn for Nigeria’s secret police\nthe practicals would help them to navigate their phones through talking back to the phones, as opposed to using hand prompts and improve their everyday life with Android devices and AI.\n“We’ve introduced them to some accessibility tools on their Android called Voice Access, Reading Mode, and TalkBack. This can help them to access their devices and control their devices through voice access, through Reading Mode, help them read their screens with Reading Mode on Android, and then TalkBack also helps them to navigate their phones through talking back to the phones, as opposed to using hand prompts.\n“We’ve also introduced them to how AI can support them in learning and in navigating their environment, the environment around them.\nSo for that, we introduced them to Gemini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, which has an audio ability for them to find information from anywhere around the world by just talking into the Gemini app.\n“The second thing on Gemini 2.5 flash is called Gemini Live which helps them navigate their environment around them. So once they activate Gemini Live and activate the camera it becomes their eyes. They can ask it to scan the room and tell them what it sees. It can help them read anything that the eye sees in the environment like signs so that they are safe and understand where they’ve gotten into,” she added.\nOlumide Oladimeji, a 300-Level Political Science student at UNILAG, praised the facilitators for bring his age long dream to reality,adding the training has opened his eyes to important things.\n“It’s a wonderful one. In fact, the thought of Google having to come here has been one of my lifelong dreams. I’ve really, really been hoping that I would be a consultant, an accessibility consultant, working with Google, having to bring about new features and accessibility,” he stated.",

    "text": "Massachusetts school officials responded to a [transgender](https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-18-year-old-female-trans-student-charged-for-planning-two-school-shootings-in-maryland-wanted-to-be-famous) student's \"hit list\" by creating an LGBTQ affinity group and conducting anti-bias training. The hit list included the names of 40 students and staff members at Watertown Middle School near Boston. Instead of taking disciplinary action against the [trans-identified student](https://thepostmillennial.com/pa-middle-school-girl-says-trans-student-who-allegedly-beat-another-with-stanley-cup-had-hit-list) for creating the threat, school officials called for \"empathy for the creator\" of the list, according to internal emails obtained through a public records request, the Daily Mail [reports](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13337991/Leaked-emails-woke-Massachusetts-school-transgender-student-hit-list.html). In January, a faculty member overheard students talking about a \"hit list\" created by a transgender student at Watertown Middle School. The staff member searched the students' Chromebook and found a document, which was titled \"hit list.\" The school notified the police about the incident and interviewed the student in question. Following the investigation, Watertown Public Schools Superintendent Dede Galdston issued a [statement](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/officials-handled-trans-students-hit-list-by-creating-lgbtq-affinity-group-report/ar-AA1nB8j4) about the hit list, claiming that officials determined there was \"no credible threat\" to student's safety, which did not sit well with anxious parents. \"We are grateful to our staff for quickly assessing this situation,\" said Galdston, who claimed that the student did not plan on carrying out acts of violence and was simply \"expressing their frustration on paper.\" Galdston informed parents that the student would be returned to the classroom, claiming that the student wanted to \"make amends\" with the individuals featured on the hit list. Parents of students named on the list became irate after school officials explained that they wanted to take a more progressive approach to address the matter. Parents felt that the school's response was too lax, per the outlet. Jennifer Chen Fein, the school's principal, responded to the apparent threat by stating in an email to colleagues that the school needs to tackle \"anti-trans and other biased behavior.\" Lily Rayman-Read, a school counselor, responded to the threat by calling for \"empathy for the creator\" of the hit list. She then expressed the need for an \"immediate creation of an affinity space for LGBTQIA+ families,\" in emails. A forum was held at the school for parents of students featured on the list, which resulted in Galdston saying their concerns were \"student shaming.\" One of the parents sent an email to the school following the meeting and wrote, \"I am very frustrated with the lack of information … about your steps to ensure the safety of the school environment and your plan for reintegrating the student who wrote the Hit List.\" Comments Powered by StructureCMS™ Comments Join and support independent free thinkers!

    "title": "The Internet of Things (IoT): An Indispensable Element in the Current Digital Epoch",
    "text": "In the prevailing digital epoch, the Internet of Things (IoT) has surfaced as an indispensable element. The IoT is an intricate matrix of physical entities, or ‘things’, that possess the ability to connect to the internet. These IoT devices can span from ordinary household commodities to intricate industrial apparatus.\nThe IoT has transformed the manner in which individuals exist and operate, rendering everyday chores more efficient and expedient. It has also paved the way for new prospects for businesses, empowering them to streamline procedures, enhance customer service, and devise new business models.\nThe Necessity of Overseeing IoT Devices\nMonitor status of IoT devices is a crucial facet of administering an IoT network. This involves amassing, scrutinizing, and managing data from these devices. The data amassed from IoT devices can offer valuable insights into their performance and functionality, aiding in identifying potential issues and implementing necessary measures to prevent or rectify problems.\nRemoteIoT: A Premier Instrument for IoT Supervision\nRemoteIoT is a premier instrument for IoT supervision. It offers a platform for users to supervise the status of their IoT devices, exhibit device data, and trigger alerts and notifications in real time. This instrument is particularly beneficial for businesses that heavily rely on IoT devices for their operations.\nSupervising Specific IoT Devices: A Deep Dive into Raspberry Pi\nIn the expansive and ever-evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), certain devices have carved a niche for themselves. They possess a unique blend of features and capabilities that set them apart from the crowd. One such device that has captured the imagination of many is the Raspberry Pi.\nThe Raspberry Pi, despite its diminutive size, is a powerful computer that can comfortably nestle in the palm of people’s hand. It’s a marvel of modern technology, packing enough power to handle a diverse range of IoT tasks. From controlling smart home devices to serving as a server, the Raspberry Pi can do it all.\nThis tiny powerhouse has won the hearts of everyone, from weekend hobbyists experimenting in their garages to seasoned professionals developing complex systems. Its flexibility and affordability are its major selling points, making it an accessible and versatile tool in the realm of IoT.\nHowever, the task of monitoring the status of a Raspberry Pi is not as straightforward as one might think. It requires a specialized set of tools and a particular skill set, each tailored to the device and its specific functions. These tools provide real-time insights into the device’s performance, allowing users to keep a close eye on its operation.\nMonitor status of a Raspberry Pi, or any IoT device for that matter, is a mission-critical task. The primary objective is to ensure the device is running smoothly, performing its tasks efficiently, and maintaining its health. Early detection of potential issues is key to this process. Spotting a problem before it escalates can save time, effort, and resources.\nEnhanced Efficiency and Cost Savings\nMonitor status of IoT devices ensures they are operating at their peak performance. This optimal functioning can significantly enhance efficiency. For instance, in an industrial setting, well-monitored IoT devices can streamline operations, reduce downtime, and increase productivity. Moreover, efficient devices consume less energy, leading to substantial cost savings in the long run.\nProactive Maintenance and Extended Device Longevity\nIoT device supervision allows for the early detection of potential issues. This early detection facilitates proactive maintenance and repairs. For example, a temperature sensor in an IoT-enabled HVAC system might be showing readings that are consistently off by a few degrees. By catching this early, users can recalibrate or replace the sensor before it results in significant energy waste or damage to other components. Such a proactive approach not only enhances the device’s performance but also extends its lifespan, leading to further cost savings.\nInformed Decision-Making and Strategy Development\nSupervising IoT devices also provides valuable insights into device usage patterns. These insights can be instrumental for businesses in understanding how their devices are being utilized. For instance, usage patterns can reveal peak usage times, user preferences, and even potential misuse of the devices. This data can guide decision-making processes, aid in the development of effective strategies, and inform future IoT deployments. It can also help businesses to tailor their services more closely to their customers’ needs, improving customer satisfaction and potentially opening up new revenue streams.\nSecurity and Compliance\nAnother critical aspect of IoT device supervision is security. With the increasing prevalence of IoT devices, they have become attractive targets for cybercriminals. Effective supervision includes monitoring for any signs of security breaches, such as unusual data patterns or unauthorized access attempts, and taking swift action to address them. Additionally, in regulated industries, IoT device supervision can help ensure compliance with standards and regulations, such as data protection and privacy laws.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of IoT supervision continues to grow. Tools like RemoteIoT and techniques for supervising specific devices like the Raspberry Pi are simplifying the process of tracking devices and ensuring their optimal functionality. As we continue to navigate the digital age, the role of IoT supervision will only become more critical. It is indeed an exhilarating time to be part of this technological revolution.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name:\nREMOTEIOT INC.\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail:\nSend Email\nPhone: +1 866 516 0608\nCountry: United States\nWebsite:\nhttps://remoteiot.com",
