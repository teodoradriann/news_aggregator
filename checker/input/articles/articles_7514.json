    "text": "BARNESVILLE, Minn. (Valley News Live) - A long-time coach in Barnesville, Minnesota, has resigned from his coaching position. The head coach of the girls basketball team, Ryan Bomstad, submitted his resignation on May 20. In his resignation letter, Bomstad said Barnesville Girls Basketball has been one of his top priorities for the last 12 years. “As life progresses and circumstances change, I feel it is necessary to focus much of my energy on other avenues of life. It is time to watch my children grow up and be at their events being a dad. It has been extremely tough missing my kids’ events to coach others,” Bomstad wrote. He thanked the coaches who have been part of the program, as well as the kids, parents and fans. Valley News Live has received dozens of Whistleblower calls and emails throughout the 2023-2024 school year, claiming Bomstad was verbally abusive toward players. One community member who wanted to remain anonymous told Valley News Live “all of the girls on the team have said they will quit next year if this issue is not resolved quickly.” Another community member said complaints had been filed against Bomstad, writing to Valley News Live: “Concerned parents have reached out to the AD, superintendent, and principal requesting his removal due to his offensive and disrespectful comments towards the players. It is crucial to take action and report these actions to the school administration. Please report on this as it is public knowledge.” Someone claiming to be a parent of a girls basketball player wrote to Valley News Live: “Someone needs to report on this because the girls need a voice. I can speak for my junior and that she is considering not coming out for basketball. I am using a fake name as I do not want my daughter ousted for us speaking out. Call the school demand to see the improvement plan.” Valley News Live contacted Barnesville Superintendent Jon Ellerbusch several times throughout the school year, requesting the personnel and disciplinary files for Ryan Bomstad. On May 7, Ellerbusch responded to Valley News Live by writing: “The School District is aware of complaints concerning Mr. Bomstad” and “The complaints are presently under review by the administration.” Bomstad resigned as the coach on May 20. Valley News Live has reached out to Ryan Bomstad for comment, but has not received a response back. Copyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.",

Photo: Defence Intelligence of Ukraine\nAndrii Yusov, a representative of Defence Intelligence, has said that Ukraine has turned to Russia to bring back the bodies of prisoners of war who, according to Moscow propagandists, were on board the downed Il-76 aircraft, but Russia is not responding.\nSource: Yusov on the national joint 24/7 newscast\nDetails: Yusov said that the exchange of prisoners of war on January 31 was \"almost the end\" of the disrupted operation on the day of the Il-76 incident. He said that, as part of the exchange, Ukrainians who were supposed to be exchanged on January 24 came home.\nWith the exception of 65 people from the list published by Kremlin-controlled Russian propagandists.\nQuote: \"Regarding the information about the deaths, Ukraine has applied and continues to apply for the transfer of bodies. So far, the Russian side has not agreed to this.\nTherefore, our state's demand for an impartial international investigation into not only the circumstances of the downing of the Il-76 remains relevant, but also to find out what was actually inside — whether there were people or ammunition, who were there besides the crew. So far, Russia has not confirmed the process of an international open investigation.\"\nBackground:\nA Russian Il-76 aircraft crashed in the Korocha district of Russia's Belgorod Oblast . Sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated the plane was carrying S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The Russian Defence Ministry said the plane was carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war to Belgorod for a swap. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence , two Ukrainian missiles were \"fired\", killing 74 people, including 65 Ukrainian POWs.\nRussian propagandist Margarita Simonyan published a list of the Ukrainian prisoners of war who she alleges were on board the Il-76 aircraft that crashed. Only the names of the six dead crew members are known to the media.\nDefence Intelligence of Ukraine confirmed that the swap scheduled for 24 January did not take place, but they had no information about the Ukrainian prisoners on board the Il-76. In the previous swap, prisoners had been delivered by plane, but Ukraine had been made aware of that in advance.\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, without mentioning the Il-76, that it was taking all measures to protect Ukraine and Ukrainians.\nAndrii Yusov said that Russian officials were supposed to be on board the Il-76 , but at the last minute, the FSB forbade them to board. He said only five bodies were delivered to the local morgue after the incident. Yusov also suggested that the plane could have been carrying both missiles and people .\nRussia has not provided the UN Security Council with any evidence that there were Ukrainian prisoners of war on board the Il-76 military transport plane that recently crashed in Belgorod Oblast and has rejected a request for an international commission to investigate what happened near Belgorod on 24 January.\nUkrainian Parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets said there is no reason to believe that there were Ukrainian prisoners of war on board the Russian Il-76 plane that crashed near Belgorod on 24 January; Russia is not allowing international experts to investigate and can continue to accuse Ukraine of causing the deaths of Ukrainians without proof.\nSupport UP or become our patron !\nView comments",

    "text": "On a global scale, 2023 has officially been the hottest year on record.\nAlthough records only go back 170 years, meteorologists have been able to use simulations to determine that 2023 has been the warmest of the last 125,000 years.\n© Jeannot Ries\nFerrone warns that Luxembourgers will have to prepare for more heat and rain combinations in the future, as the phenomenon is increasing around the globe.\n\"The warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture it can absorb, which potentially leads to more precipitation. This is particularly evident in heavier or extreme rainfall. In Luxembourg, and across the world, we can see that this phenomenon is on the rise. In terms of the long-term trends for rain, here in Luxembourg, statistically speaking, it does not appear to change too much over the years.\"\nHowever, weather services have observed that the winters are becoming wetter, while spring is marked by drier conditions. Currently, we are experiencing what is known as an El Nino year, Ferrone explains.\n\"It is expected that 2024 will also be an extremely warm year. In Luxembourg, it's not so easy to offer a clear forecast, as long-term predictions are a little trickier. We also can't precisely predict the amount of rainfall. But we do have to bear in mind that the current tendencies are likely to continue, at least for the next 30 years or so.\"\nGlobally, however, temperatures are expected to continue rising, with more drought predicted, but also more extreme weather occurrences, such as extremely heavy rainfall.\nVideo report in Luxembourgish:",

    "text": "Boletim da Fiocruz indica alta de casos de covid-19 no país 19/12/2024 19h49\nA nova edição do boletim semanal Infogripe, divulgado nesta quinta-feira (19) pela Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), revela uma tendência alta de casos de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SRAG) associadas ao covid-19 em alguns estados do país. É o caso do Ceará, onde um cenário de crescimento dessas ocorrências já havia sido indicado na edição anterior da publicação.\nHá indícios de que Minas Gerais, Sergipe e Rondônia também iniciam um movimento parecido. O mesmo ocorre no Distrito Federal. Os casos envolvem especialmente pacientes idosos, que são mais suscetíveis aos efeitos mais adversos da infecção pelo coronavírus causador da covid-19.\nNotícias relacionadas: Quase 19% das pessoas que tiveram covid-19 têm sintomas persistentes. O boletim registra aumento de ocorrências de SRAG entre crianças e adolescentes de até 14 anos, associados principalmente ao rinovírus, em quatro unidades federativas: Acre, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais e Sergipe. Os dados do novo boletim são referentes à semana epidemiológica que vai de 8 a 14 de dezembro.\nA SRAG é uma complicação respiratória que demanda hospitalização e está associada muitas vezes ao agravamento de alguma infecção viral. O paciente pode apresentar desconforto respiratório e queda no nível de saturação de oxigênio, entre outros sintomas.\nDe acordo com a nova edição, considerando as últimas quatro semanas epidemiológicas analisadas, a covid-19 esteve relacionada a 31,1% dos casos de SRAG com resultado positivo para alguma infecção viral. Já o rinovírus representou 38,6%. Além disso, 7,9% estiveram associados ao vírus sincicial respiratório (VSR), 7,6% à influenza A e 7,3% à influenza B.\nQuando se observa apenas os quadros de SRAG que resultaram em mortes nessas quatro semanas, 63,6% estão associados à covid-19. A maioria desses casos que tiveram a morte como desfecho envolveram idosos.\nAo todo, o Brasil já registrou em 2024 um total de 78.739 casos de SRAG com resultado laboratorial positivo para algum vírus respiratório. Destes, 16,8% são referentes à influenza A; 2% à influenza B; 19,6% à covid-19; 27,1% ao rinovírus e 33,8% ao VSR. Outras 8.280 ocorrências estão em fase de análise.\nO boletim Infogripe sinaliza para uma tendência de aumento de SRAG em nível nacional. Em 11 unidades federativas, há sinal de crescimento dos casos no longo prazo: Acre, Amazonas, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Santa Catarina e Sergipe. Além disso, há tendência de aumento das ocorrência no curto prazo no Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Norte e Rio Grande do Sul.\nCenário em 2024 Fazendo um balanço do cenário epidemiológico de 2024, a pesquisadora da Fiocruz, Tatiana Portella, destacou que o país viveu duas ondas importantes de covid-19. A primeira, que começou ainda no final de 2023 e avançou pelo início deste ano, afetou diversos estados. Já a segunda onda, iniciada em agosto de 2024, teve São Paulo como o estado mais atingido.\nApesar dessas duas ondas, a pesquisadora destaca que, em comparação com 2023, houve uma redução de aproximadamente 40% nos casos de SRAG associados à covid-19. Ainda assim, Portella alerta para o crescimento dessas ocorrências no encerramento de 2024.\n\"Neste fim de ano, observamos uma menor atividade dos vírus respiratórios, com exceção apenas da covid-19, que já começa a apresentar sinais de aumento em algumas regiões do país. Para as festas de fim de ano, recomendamos o uso de máscaras caso surjam sintomas de gripe ou resfriado. Também sugerimos, sempre que possível, priorizar ambientes mais arejados, especialmente neste momento de início de aumento do número de casos de covid-19\".",

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Receiving backlash for a video where he recited verses from the Quran in front of the Batu Caves Hindu Temple, a tourist has now issued an apology. The tourist who goes by the handle @abdeentube apologised for his behaviour on his TikTok account. In the video, he said he received angry messages after making the video which has since been taken down. \"For me, it is strange because I thought it was a historic point (historic site) and I can recite the Quran here because it is my content. Right now I feel that it is not welcome in this place. This is a special video for the Hindus, Buddhists and any religion. \"I thought it was a historic site and anyone can make content there. It did not think it would hurt people, especially the Hindus,\" he said in the video posted on Saturday (May 25). The man who goes by Abdeen in his profile apologised if he had hurt anyone. \"It was not my intention to hurt anyone or to make people feel bad by reciting the Quran which is my content. I do this everywhere, I am spreading love,\" he said. It was reported that he uploaded a video on his TikTok account sparking a debate questioning the moral basis and the man’s intent in reciting Islamic verses in front of the Lord Murugan statue in Batu Caves. An online portal shared that Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Mohd Na’im Mokhtar condemned the tourist’s actions for reciting the Quran verses at the Batu Caves Hindu temple. Mohd Na'im deemed the behaviour of the tourist as highly inappropriate and disrespectful, presuming that the individual lacked an understanding of Malaysia's multicultural society and the sanctity of religious sites. \"The actions of this individual, who recited verses from the Quran (Surah Al-Anbiya' verses 66 and 67) at a non-Muslim place of worship, were completely unacceptable. \"He did not comprehend the situation and reality of religious harmony in Malaysia,\" Na’im told the portal. The minister warned that such provocative actions could severely undermine the peaceful coexistence of different faiths in the country. Mohd Na'im then said that Islam strictly prohibits insulting other religions, as it will only provoke retaliation and enmity. WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!",

    "text": "Israeli forces announced its plan of action for \"expanding ground operations,\" as they struck cities, towns, and refugee camps across Gaza resulting in a new mass exodus. Gaza residents spoke with [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-10-30-23/h_89fed633d04b80f99cab5906fe00ad5d) earlier and said that they had been subjected to the most intense airstrikes since Hamas' October 7 attack and that their communications links have been completely severed. Israel has ordered civilians to vacate the area as their forces close in. To the south, Israeli forces targeted the center of a hospital in Khan Younis, the primary southern city in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian residents were gravely concerned about a ground incursion into an area already densely populated by families rendered homeless in the past 12 weeks of war. Israel launched the war to dismantle the militant organization, Hamas, that runs Gaza. This comes after the group stormed through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on October 7. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-attacks-gaza-add-heavy-palestinian-toll-war-hamas-2023-12-27/) revealed 1,200 Israelis were killed and roughly 240 were taken hostage. Since then, 110 hostages were freed during a temporary truce in late November and another 23 have been declared dead in absentia, said an Israeli government spokesperson on Thursday. Bassel Kheir al-Din, a journalist with a local TV station spoke with [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221952425/israeli-strikes-gaza-palestinians-killed) and said the strike flattened his family house and severely damaged three neighboring homes. He said 12 members of his family - including three children aged 2, 7, and 8 - were buried and presumed dead, and that nine neighbors were missing. According to Palestinian health authorities, Reuters reported that 210 people were confirmed dead by Israeli strikes within the last 24 hours, increasing the death toll to 21,320 Palestinians killed since the onset of the war. Thousands of others are unaccounted for amidst the debris and devastation in the aftermath. Saeed Mustafa, a resident of the Nuseirat refugee camp also told NPR, \"It was another night of killing and massacres.\" He said people were still crying out from the rubble of a house hit by an airstrike on Wednesday. \"We are unable to get them out. We hear their screams but we don't have equipment,\" he continued. As Israel has sharpened its offensive tactics, Palestinians have fled into shelters and tent camps along the Egyptian border and Mediterranean coastline. Israel's offensive in [Gaza](https://www.hngn.com/articles/255195/20231227/israeli-pm-netanyahu-refuses-discuss-post-war-plans-gaza-protect-position.htmhttps://) stands as one of the most catastrophic military campaigns witnessed in recent history. Israel has declared its intention to persist with its ground operation until Hamas is eliminated, asserting that this is the only viable way to protect its security and release any remaining hostages. Palestinians have stated that eradicating Hamas is an unattainable goal due to the militant group's decentralized structure and deeply rooted presence in a territory it has ruled since 2007.",
