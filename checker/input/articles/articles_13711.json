    "text": "The USC student revealed in January she is battling medulloblastoma. Isabella Strahan, the daughter of \" [Good Morning America](/tag/good-morning-america/)\" co-anchor [Michael Strahan](/tag/michael-strahan/), is sharing some good news as she continues to battle medulloblastoma, a type of brain tumor. Isabella revealed Wednesday on her YouTube channel that she will be done with chemotherapy in May after her treatments were reduced. \"My doctor just called me and told me I only have to do two more rounds of chemotherapy, and it's like the biggest thing. I'm so happy,\" Isabella said, while crying what she described as \"happy tears.\" \"So I'll be done in May and I can kind of try to have a summer to feel better.\" Isabella said she was originally told she would have to do six rounds of chemotherapy, which would have had her finishing treatments at the end of July. Now, with her rounds of chemotherapy reduced to four, Isabella Strahan said she will have more time off from treatments before returning in the fall to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The 19-year-old was just one month into her freshman year at USC last fall when she began experiencing headaches and nausea. After testing, doctors discovered she had developed a fast-growing 4-centimeter tumor, larger than a golf ball, in the back of her brain, which was diagnosed as medulloblastoma. MORE: [Michael Strahan says daughter is 'fighting through' chemotherapy after brain tumor diagnosis](/michael-strahan-daughter-isabella-malignant-brain-tumor/14453145/) Medulloblastoma is a type of malignant tumor that accounts for about 20% of all childhood brain tumors, according to estimates published in the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience. About 300 children are diagnosed with medulloblastoma each year. Since her diagnosis, which she revealed publicly in January, Isabella has undergone brain surgery as well as several rounds of radiation treatment. She began chemotherapy in February and has endured several hospitalizations due to setbacks including fevers. In her latest vlog, Isabella spoke about side effects of chemotherapy she has experienced including hair loss, brain fog, physical weakness and fatigue. She has been sharing her health journey and raising awareness about brain tumors on her YouTube channel, which benefits Duke University's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, where she has been receiving treatment. Near the end of her latest video, Isabella breaks down in tears when she is surprised by her twin sister, Sophia, who is a student at Duke University. \"Today just go so much better because Sophia just surprised me,\" she said. \"There are a lot of happy tears today.\"",

    "text": "NATO members in Western Europe have drawn a torrent of criticism in recent years for failing to spend enough on defense and take their own national security seriously. It’s a fair charge, despite some recent improvements. Yet, one of the least responsible NATO members isn’t in Europe at all. It’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Canada.\nIn 2014, NATO members committed to a defense spending guideline of 2 percent of GDP. At the time, only three allies met this target. However, since Russia invaded Ukraine, many NATO countries have accelerated their commitments to increase defense spending, and most NATO members now hit this spending goal.\nThe Canadian government, however, is one of the few NATO allies that fails to meet the 2 percent defense expenditure threshold.\nCanada isn’t a small country, nor is it a poor one. It’s perfectly capable of meeting its treaty obligations. Yet it spends a mere 1.37 percent of its GDP on defense, or roughly $30.5 billion a year. Despite having the sixth largest GDP among NATO countries, Canada ranks twenty-seventh in defense spending as a proportion of GDP. For comparison, the United States is the third-highest NATO member ranked in percentage of GDP (3.38 percent), behind only Poland and Estonia.\nCanada is more than capable of meeting its obligations and has done so before. During the Cold War, Canada was a hugely capable NATO member whose contributions to deterring the Soviet Union were absolutely critical to hemispheric security.\nThe need to spend more on defense is particularly salient for Canada, as threats to NATO don’t only come from Eastern Europe. Canada also needs to take Arctic and North American security far more seriously as the Arctic emerges as a critical area of concern, rich in untapped resources and new navigation routes that are attracting attention from our adversaries.\nChina and Russia are actively increasing their presence in the Northern Pacific Ocean as they seek to expand into the Arctic. In late September, officials from both nations convened to form a “comprehensive strategic partnership” aimed at advancing their initiatives in the region. China describes itself as a “near Arctic” state (despite being nowhere near the Arctic) and has stated its intent to build a “Polar Silk Road.”\nOn September 28, the U.S. Coast Guard spotted Chinese and Russian coast guard ships near St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, just south of the Arctic Circle. With increasing “near Arctic” encounters, Canada must bolster its defense against potential incursions from China and Russia along the Arctic coastline and not rely on the United States for Arctic security.\nAs Canadian Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu put it:\n“We can no longer ignore the threats to our sovereignty…Foreign powers are already testing our resolve, whether in the air through spy balloons or on the water through monitoring buoys. We are too dependent on the United States for Arctic defence—we must live up to our responsibilities as a northern country.”\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced plans to reach NATO’s 2 percent defense spending target. Yet these plans won’t have Canada hitting the target until 2032. This eight-year timeline is far too slow. No other NATO ally has submitted such a lackluster plan.\nTrudeau’s priorities appear to lie elsewhere. His priorities for the Ministry of Defense have been to “build an inclusive and diverse” defense team, prioritizing the elimination of “anti-Black racism, LGBTQ2 prejudice, gender bias and white supremacy.” Prime Minister Trudeau would have done better to spend Canadian resources to strengthen Canada’s military readiness and ensure Canada could defend itself and its allies.\nCanada’s continued underinvestment leaves its https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/could-ukraine-ever-join-nato/ obligations unmet and weakens the overall defense of both the alliance as a whole and the North American continent. Canadians deserve better.\nThis piece originally appeared in the National Interest",

    "title": "Kolkata doctor case: Protests escalate in India over gruesome rape of doctor | The Business Standard",
    "text": "Holding candles, hundreds of thousands of women marched through the night in cities across India, to protest the brutal rape and murder of a young female doctor in a hospital that has fueled anger over a lack of safety for women despite tough new laws. A 31-year old trainee doctor was raped and murdered inside the medical college in Kolkata where she worked on Friday, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012. \"We have come here to demand justice because even I have a daughter. I am scared to send her anywhere...I am scared to send my daughter to study,\" said Rinky Ghosh, who took part in a protest in Kolkata. \"So I am here today because something ... must be done, this injustice must stop.\" The doctor had retired to sleep on a piece of carpet in a seminar room in the R G Kar Medical College after a marathon 36-hour shift, given the lack of any dorms or resting rooms for doctors in the premises, her colleagues told Reuters. She was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime. Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice. The victim was found bleeding from her eyes and mouth, with injuries to her legs, stomach, ankles, her right hand and finger, a doctor's inquest report 9 August and accessed by Reuters said. In protests called \"Reclaim the Night\", women marched across several Indian cities from midnight on Wednesday, on the eve of the country's 78th Independence Day, to protest against the lack of safety for women in India, especially at night. \"As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an Independence Day address to the nation on Thursday. The 2012 Delhi rape case was seen as a turning point in attitudes towards women's safety in Indian society. It triggered huge protests and was the catalyst for rapid change in laws tackling crimes against women. These included fast-track courts for swifter convictions in such cases, but protesters say a decade on, the situation for women has not improved. \"This horrific incident has once again reminded us that women disproportionately bear the weight of ensuring their own safety,\" Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt said in a post on her Instagram page, which has more than 85 million followers. Doctors in India's crowded and often squalid government hospitals have long complained of being overworked and underpaid, and say not enough is done to curb violence levelled at them by people angered over the medical care on offer. Crimes against women in India rose 4% in 2022 from the previous year, data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), released late last year, showed.",

O religioso criticou o governo do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) e pediu para Nossa Senhora Aparecida \"livrar\" o País do comunismo. A declaração ocorreu durante uma missa realizada no dia 13 de outubro na cidade de Cabeceiras de Goiás, no Povoado da Lagoa, e o vídeo do momento é divulgado nas redes sociais por apoiadores do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PL).\nO padre disse que o País não tem liberdade nem democracia. Em referência aos réus e condenados pelos ataques do 8 de Janeiro, dom Adair Guimarães afirmou que \"milhares de pessoas sofrem com processos sem direito ao contraditório\" e que o Brasil tem \"presos políticos\" e \"exilados\". Procurada, a Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB) disse que não vai se pronunciar.\nA deputada federal Bia Kicis (PL-DF) compartilhou o vídeo em seu perfil no X (antigo Twitter), ressaltando as declarações do sacerdote.\nO bispo também fez uma comparação entre uma manifestante que pichou \"perdeu, mané\" na estátua \"A Justiça\", em frente ao prédio do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), e Adriana Ancelmo, ex-esposa do ex-governador do Rio de Janeiro Sérgio Cabral. \"Ela (Adriana), que pegou mais de 80 e já está solta por causa dos filhos, esses têm direitos.\"\n\"Hoje, no Brasil, é beneficiado quem é do lado estranho, mas quem defende família, liberdade, religião, fé, propriedade privada, parece que não tem mais direito\", disse o líder católico.\nDom Adair Guimarães já se envolveu com polêmicas quando criticou a vacinação e se posicionou contra o \"passaporte da vacina\" durante a pandemia de covid-19. Ele também já fez acenos à monarquia.",
