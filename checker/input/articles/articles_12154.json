    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Rain chances are set to linger into your Friday as a weakening frontal boundary dissipates over the area.\nNow heavy rains have continued overnight leading to as much as 6-9″ of rain, mainly in St. Tammany Parish. The wet roads and possible flooding could slow you down as you get started this morning so give yourself some extra time heading into work.\nThrough the morning I do expected the overnight rains to weaken but as daytime heating kicks in this afternoon, a reformation of showers and downpours will be possible. Our coverage of rain will remain elevated for one more day.\nThis weekend we revert back to more sun and warm/humid conditions. Highs will jump back to the middle 80s with a humid breeze blowing in from the Gulf.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.

    "text": "Ha chiesto di cambiare camera, facendosi spostare in una saletta interna invece che nella stanza vista mare. «Non riesco a dormire da una camera in cui si vede il mare» confessa a Repubblica una delle hostess che era a bordo del Bayesian e che ora è ospitata, insieme all'equipaggio, nel blindatissimo resort Zagarella. Il clima nell'albergo, a 10 giorni dal naufragio, è ancora di profondo choc, mentre la procura di Termini Imerese ha dato il via libera per lasciare l'isola ai membri dell'equipaggio. Sono indagate tre persone: il capitano James Cutfield, il marinaio Matthew Griffith e l’ufficiale di macchina Tim Parker Eaton. Nei giorni scorsi l'equipaggio ha pranzato insieme nei pressi della piscina del resort, sempre con sguardi cupi e tristi. Il capitano torna con jet privato a Maiorca Il capitano Cutfield ha lasciato l'Italia a bordo di un jet privato insieme alla moglie Cristina. I due sono diretti a Maiorca, dove vivono. Il 51enne è accusato di naufragio e omicidio colposo e nei vari interrogatori alla procura di Termini Imerese si è avvalso della facoltà di non rispondere. Con lui sarebbe ripartito anche l'ufficiale di macchina indagato Tim Parker Eaton, mentre Matthew Griffiths, che la notte della bufera era di guardia in plancia e ha raggiunto Nizza. Le tre hostess a bordo A bordo del Bayesian c'erano anche tre hostess, due sono ripartite per Istanbul, mentre una è rimasta a Porticello. Il 28 agosto nel pomeriggio avevano lasciato l'Italia altri membri dell'equipaggio, andati a Dubai. Ripartiti nei giorni precedenti anche i familiari delle vittime e i superstiti, tra cui Anna Barcares moglie di Mike Lynch e proprietaria dello yacht, avevano già lasciato la Sicilia con un jet privato alcuni giorni fa.",

    "text": "AMMAN — Jordanians have expressed a positive outlook following the government’s recent amendments to tobacco prices, viewing the changes as a step towards promoting healthier lifestyles.\nDirector General of the Income and Sales Tax Department Hussam Abu Ali recently said that the department issued official letters to all tobacco companies in the Kingdom, instructing them to strictly adhere to the updated prices for the cigarette brands they produce.\nCompanies and distributors were also directed to ensure that the price increase does not exceed JD0.10 per pack of cigarettes. Regulation No. 62 of 2024 also set a minimum price of JD1.7 per pack.\n“These new amendments are a step towards promoting healthier habits across the country. Personally, I think cigarette prices should be even higher,” Seren Yousef, in her 20s, told The Jordan Times on Thursday.\nShe added: “With these price hikes, smokers might reconsider their habit. This could be the perfect opportunity to quit for good.”\nSamir Shahin, a university student, said that the price increase is a positive measure as it may reduce smoking-related illnesses and encourage smokers to adopt healthier habits and alternatives.\n\"Not everyone is on board with the changes, but we can't deny that it's a step in the right direction,\" he said, adding that such measures are particularly important for young people, who are increasingly consuming tobacco at universities and other public areas.\nMahmoud Bilal, a physician, stressed the importance of the decision, particularly in less privileged communities where smoking rates are higher.\n\"Raising cigarette prices has been shown in many reports to significantly reduce tobacco consumption,\" he said, adding that such decisions help foster healthier lifestyles.",

    "title": "Experts forecast sunny outlook for 2024 Chinese travel market - World - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "Experts forecast sunny outlook for 2024 Chinese travel market Trip numbers expected to continue post-pandemic recovery The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted outbound travel from China, causing a halt for nearly three years. The recovery of international travel in 2023 was slower than expected after China reopened its borders. However, experts are optimistic that in 2024, a full recovery will occur, re-establishing China as the world's largest travel market. The latest data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization, or UNWTO, indicates that the Chinese outbound tourism market recovered about 55 percent in the third quarter of 2023. As reported by global travel data provider OAG, in Nov 2023 domestic capacity surpassed 2019 levels by 11 percent, but international seats were 57 percent of numbers from Nov 2019. Oliver Sedlinger, an international tourism consultant at Sedlinger and Associates in Beijing, is optimistic about the Chinese market. He highlighted 2023's strong comeback and predicted a positive outlook for 2024, emphasizing the need for the European travel industry to re-engage with the Chinese market. He stressed the importance of re-establishing connections, staying informed about market trends, and not overlooking the vast potential of the Chinese market. \"For long-term strategic benefits, I think it makes a lot of sense to observe this market and to learn about its travel preferences,\" Sedlinger added. Wolfgang Arlt, director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, predicted fierce competition among China, the United States and Germany for the title of the largest global outbound tourism source market in 2023, with all three countries reaching similar levels. However, Arlt confidently stated that \"In 2024, China for sure will be back as world No 1, with China's arrival numbers in most destinations to reach, at the very least, almost the same level as the pre-pandemic year of 2019\". Dragon Trail, a China-focused digital marketing and travel company, predicts a 70-percent recovery for China's outbound travel market by the end of 2023, aligning with airlines' winter-spring season plans. Tiana Tian, a research analyst at Dragon Trail, anticipated 2024 as a year of recovery, with the remaining 30 percent of lost travel demand gradually returning throughout the year, driven by holiday periods like May Day and the National Day Golden Week, and with a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024. \"Limited personal income and time constraints are cited as the primary reasons for Chinese travelers choosing not to go abroad as indicated by our survey results,\" she added. According to Tian, the preferences of Chinese tourists are evolving towards high-quality and experiential travel. Personalized and flexible travel products are gaining popularity, while self-driving tours and specialized tourism offerings tailored to specific interests are also attracting attention. These trends are particularly prominent among the post-90s and post-00s generations, who exhibit a preference for independent travel planning. Chinese nationals made 155 million overseas visits in 2019, spending a staggering $255 billion, according to data from the China Tourism Academy and the UNWTO. This is nearly double the total spent by visitors from the US, three times the total spent by Germans, and almost four times the total spent by British tourists. In a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, it was revealed that travelers from the Chinese mainland surpassed individuals from other markets in terms of shopping expenditures. On average, Chinese travelers spent $1,350 per person, highlighting their significant contribution to the global tourism market. David Goodger, managing director for Europe and the Middle East at Tourism Economics, said: \"Chinese travel will take further large strides towards recovery in 2024 and we anticipate that international travel spending will surpass 2019 values next year.\" \"Restoring connectivity is the crucial first step in driving growth from China and regaining market share, as well as continuing to ensure easy visa application processes. Further movement towards more facilitative visa policy or even visa-free travel will ensure an uplift in activity and allow gains in market share,\" he said. Goodger believes increasing wealth and the continued growth in the travel class will mean that there will also be a lot of new travellers still wanting some of the more traditional package tours. \"As recovery continues, we anticipate that Chinese travellers will visit a wider range of destinations and participate in additional activities. Some continued shift in per trip spend (in real, inflation-adjusted terms) is likely to persist,\" he added.",

    "text": "The Providence College men’s hockey team has been on quite a heater, rattling off eight straight wins to improve to 15-3-2. Included in that stretch was a sweep of Colorado College, a pair of victories at Dartmouth to capture the Ledyard Classic, and last week’s 2-0 win at Brown to retain the Mayor’s Cup.\n“We’ve got a lot of belief, and they’re working hard,” said coach Nate Leaman . “You don’t get these moments without the work and preparation, and that’s why they’re being rewarded.”\nRelated : Hockey East teams dominating PairWise rankings The win over Brown capped the nonconference slate that saw the Friars go 10-1 and vaulted them to third in the PairWise, the system used to select and seed teams for the NCAA Tournament. But after Providence was idle last weekend, it dropped to fifth, which still has the team in good standing as it gets set to close out the regular season with 15 Hockey East games, the first 11 of which are against teams currently ranked in the top 13 of the PairWise.\nThat stretch starts this weekend with a home-and-home series against Boston College, which is second, beginning Friday night at Conte Forum. The 14-4-1 Eagles were the last team to defeat the Friars, a 3-2 win at Providence Nov. 19.\nAdvertisement\n“I feel good about us, but our second half is as hard as anyone’s,” said Leaman. “The most exciting thing is we’re just playing as a good group. We’re playing as a team, as a unit of five all the time. The right things are being said by the guys. Our young guys have really matured.”\nSophomore Tanner Adams leads Providence with nine goals. Logan Will , a graduate transfer from Colorado College, leads the Friars in points on seven goals and 11 assists, followed by Adams with 15 and freshman John Mustard 5-9—14. Will has an eight-game point streak (3-6—9), which is tied for the second-longest active in the NCAA ( Isaac Howard , Michigan State, nine).\nPower-play goal from Will for his seventh of the year to open the scoring! Centrella and Elger with the assists. #GoFriars pic.twitter.com/tW7YsHh7CS\n— PC Men's Hockey (@FriarsHockey) January 8, 2025 Freshman Trevor Connelly, a first-round pick of the Golden Knights in last June’s NHL Draft, is back after skating on Team USA’s squad that won gold at the World Junior Championship.\nBC is coming off of a 3-1 win at home over Harvard Tuesday night. The Eagles were minus captain Eamon Powell and Aram Minnetian , both of whom are right-shot defensemen and eat up a lot of minutes. Senior Aidan Hreschuk moved over to the right side to skate on the top pairing with Drew Fortescue as BC still managed to limit the Crimson to 21 shots.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of whether Powell and/or Minnetian is available this weekend, the Eagles know what to expect when they face Providence.\n“They play very hard and they play their system very well,” said BC coach Greg Brown . “They don’t give free opportunities, they don’t give up free ice. You have to earn everything you get.\n“It’s not only important to manage the puck for us, but it’s going to be really important to keep doing the little things without the puck, taking their space away. It will be a very competitive weekend.”\nSilver lining Harvard coach Ted Donato was quick to point out that he is not about moral victories, but there were some positive takeaways from the loss at BC. It was a one-goal game late in the third period, until Brady Berard salted it away with an empty-netter with 1:19 remaining.\nThat performance followed up a six-point weekend in which Harvard posted 3-1 victories over Brown and Yale.\nAnother day, another robbery from Charette 🛑\n📺 https://t.co/Oh1XG9WVSi\n📊 https://t.co/kliBM3Kk14 #GoCrimson | #OneCrimson pic.twitter.com/ehD0g4EAh8\n— Harvard Men's Hockey (@HarvardMHockey) January 15, 2025 “It took us a while to come to the realization that we really need to defend at a really high level, and manage the puck better and not give up outnumbered rushes,” said Donato.\nThe Crimson will look to take that same approach this weekend when they hit the road for a pair of games at RPI and Union.\nWeekend plans The matchup between BC and Providence isn’t the only series in Hockey East involving teams inside the PairWise bubble. UConn (11th) heads to Maine (third) for a pair of games. Both teams are coming off sweeps and have won three in a row. It marks the first time the teams have met where both are ranked. Boston University (eighth) and UNH (13th) begin a home-and-home series on Friday in Durham … Northeastern travels to Vermont for two, while UMass and Merrimack play a home-and-home series beginning Friday night in North Andover … Bentley hosts Holy Cross for a pair of games, marking the Falcons’ first appearance on home ice since Nov. 23.\nAdvertisement",

    "title": "Metal Gear Solid Δ : Pas de Cross-Play pour le mode Fox Hunt...",
    "text": "Metal Gear Solid Δ : Pas de Cross-Play pour le mode Fox Hunt...\nMis à jour le 14 août 2025Metal Gear Solid Δ : Snake Eater essuie un petit revers...\nIl y a de cela quelques mois,\nKonami annonçait fièrement un mode de jeu multijoueur unique\npour Metal Gear Solid Δ : Snake Eater baptisé\nFox Hunt. Un mode partageant quelques éléments avec Metal Gear\nOnline, mais complètement original et, surtout, essentiellement\nbasé sur la furtivité plutôt que sur le canardage à tout\nva !\nPour synthétiser le peu de ce que\nl’on sait à son sujet pour le moment, ce mode s’annonce comme une\nsorte de cache-cache avec gadgets et autres camouflages de haute\ntechnologie, dans lequel il faudra évidemment tomber sur ses\nennemis par surprise. La chose s’annonce franchement sympathique\nmais, malheureusement, une petite mauvaise nouvelle le concernant\nvient de nous parvenir. Mauvaise nouvelle que Konami a confirmée\nsur le réseau social X :\n« Information concernant le mode de jeu en ligne \"Fox Hunt\" de Metal Gear Solid Δ : Snake Eater, le cross-play entre différentes plateformes n'est pas pris en charge. »\nUn Cross-Play qui joue aussi à cache-cache...\nSi la nouvelle n’est pas catastrophique en soit, il est tout de même bien dommage de voir que le mode Fox Hunt de Metal Gear Solid Δ : Snake Eater ne profitera pas du cross-play. En effet, il est assez difficile de se faire une place dans le monde du multi et nul doute que le cross-play aurait permis de limiter la casse dans le cas où le nombre de joueurs s’avérerait limité sur ce mode de jeu... Au final, il ne nous restera donc qu’à espérer que celui-ci suscitera suffisamment d’intérêt, sur chaque support, pour que les amateurs ne manquent pas de partenaires de jeu...\nPour finir sur quelques rappels, si Metal Gear Solid Δ : Snake Eater nous parviendra dès le 28 août sur PC, PS5 et Xbox, ce fameux mode Fox Hunt se fera de son côté attendre un peu plus puisqu’il sortira au cours de l’automne 2025. Rappelons également qu’il ne s’agira pas du seul mode jouable, en marge de la campagne. Eh oui, les joueurs pourront aussi profiter du mini-jeu Snake vs. Monkey sur PC et PS5, mini-jeu qui était déjà disponible avec le MGS 3 original, quand les joueurs Xbox auront droit de leur côté à Snake vs. Bomberman.\nCommentaires\nAnnuler la réponse.",
