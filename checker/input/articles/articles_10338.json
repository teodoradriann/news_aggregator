    "text": "MeteoWeb » METEO » IL METEO NEL MONDO Maltempo USA, il numero dei tornado del 2024 è da record: più di 100 oltre la media storica Stagione di forte maltempo incredibilmente attiva negli USA quest'anno: la cosiddetta Tornado Alley è tornata in vita di Beatrice Raso 10 Mag 2024 | 14:16 MeteoWeb La primavera rappresenta il picco della stagione di forte maltempo negli Stati Uniti, ma il 2024 è stato incredibilmente attivo, in particolare nelle ultime settimane, portando il conteggio annuale dei tornado ad un numero record . Secondo lo Storm Prediction Center, fino alla mattina di giovedì 9 maggio, ci sono state 670 segnalazioni preliminari di tornado negli USA, ben al di sopra della media storica di 559 fino all’8 maggio. Finora ci sono state 129 segnalazioni preliminari nel mese di maggio, dopo i 378 tornado di aprile.\nGli unici anni in cui si sono verificati più tornado fino all’8 maggio sono stati il 2007, 2008, 2011 e 2017.\nLa cosiddetta Tornado Alley è tornata in vita, un cambiamento importante rispetto agli ultimi anni, quando i tornado favorivano gli stati della Costa del Golfo e la Valle del Tennessee. La maggior parte dei tornado nel 2024 si sono abbattuti su Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma e Texas . Anche l’ Ohio ha registrato un aumento di tornado, con 54 segnalazioni finora.\nIl conteggio annuale dei tornado è stato vicino o leggermente al di sotto della media storica fino a metà aprile, ma poi un cambiamento nel pattern meteorologico ha aperto la porta allo sviluppo più frequente di temporali in grado di produrre tornado negli USA centrali. Terza vittima dell’ultima ondata di maltempo\nIntanto, nelle scorse ore, è stata segnalata un’altra vittima a causa del maltempo che ha colpito gli Stati Uniti nella notte tra mercoledì 8 e giovedì 9 maggio, portando il numero delle vittime a 3 e il totale di questa settimana ad almeno 4 . Secondo la N.C. Highway Patrol, una donna della contea di York è rimasta uccisa quando una tempesta ha fatto cadere un albero sulla sua auto mercoledì pomeriggio vicino a Belmont, nella North Carolina, quasi 50km a ovest di Charlotte. La donna è morta sul posto e un passeggero è stato portato in ospedale con ferite non mortali.\nPer quanto riguarda le altre vittime, un uomo di 22 anni del Tennessee era in macchina quando è stato colpito a morte da un albero caduto durante un temporale. Sempre nel Tennessee, una donna è stata uccisa e 12 persone sono rimaste ferite quando un tornado ha devastato la contea di Maury vicino a Spring Hill, circa 55km a sud di Nashville mercoledì sera. All’inizio di questa settimana, una persona è stata uccisa quando un tornado ha devastato Barnsdall, in Oklahoma.

    "text": "Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of New York on Thursday, staging a mock funeral in a demonstration against Israel's continued heavy bombardement of the besieged Gaza strip. Holding banners demanding an immediate ceasefire, the activists gathered in Manhattan's Bryant Park while some briefly stood in the middle of the busy Sixth Avenue in the heart of New York's Midtown district. Several women shrouded in black held baby dolls swaddled in white cloths to represent the toll the fighting has taken on children in the coastal territory. The mock funeral procession headed to New York's iconic Times Square where the protest continued with giant electronic advertisements as a backdrop. \"Today's action is to draw attention to the fact that, as of now, almost 10,000 children, just children alone, not counting everybody, not counting all Palestinians, have been killed... in Gaza,\" said archivist Grace Lile, 64. The war, which started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated much of northern Gaza, and the bombardment and fighting has intensified especially in the southern city of Khan Yunis. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry. New York City has seen dozens of protests since the October 7 attack and Israel's military response, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrators taking to the streets.",

    "text": "Cyberattacks are on the rise and healthcare is a primary target.\nDuring an executive roundtable at Becker's 9th Annual Health IT + Digital Health + RCM Meeting, Nelson Carreira, CDW healthcare strategist, shared strategies and best practices to help healthcare organizations boost their security posture.\nThree key takeaways were:\n- Cybercrime is growing, becoming more sophisticated and costly, and is increasingly aimed at healthcare. According to Mr. Carreira, the volume of cyberattacks is increasing by 71% year-over-year and 32% of all cyberattacks are in the healthcare sector. The cost of recovery after a breach at a large enterprise is $100 million and it takes 28 days to recover, according to research compiled by Mr. Carreira.\n\"Advanced attacks are going to get worse,\" Mr. Carreira said. \"Deep fakes are real. Threat actors are starting to try to impersonate people. It's definitely time to add layers of protection.\"\n- Healthcare organizations need to embrace four key components of cyber resiliency.\n- Risk assessments. These are comprehensive evaluations of your environment, controls and policies based on a framework that includes feedback and remediation suggestions.\n- Standard operating procedures. These procedures encompass the way you ensure employees understand the technology, tools, processes and governance of your cybersecurity system.\n- Vulnerability management. Organizations need a system to monitor vulnerabilities in real time and prioritize addressing them\n- Identity governance. A single silo protects identity and credentials, which successfully balances user experience with security.\n- Cyber insurance and federal legislation may provide additional layers of protection. Participants discussed the availability, cost and requirements of cyber insurance programs, as well as proposed federal legislation designed to address healthcare data security.\nBy focusing on these four areas of cybersecurity as well as considering additional protections, such as cyber insurance, healthcare organizations can boost their security posture in this increasingly dangerous and expensive cyber environment.",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Ipswich Star",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",

    "text": "Brooklyn Park man who survived brutal assault with baseball bat on road to recovery A Brooklyn Park man is now out of the hospital after he was nearly killed in a brutal attack earlier this month. Devon Gray, 23, suffered severe injuries after he was [beaten with a metal bat for over a minute](https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/1-injured-1-in-custody-after-brooklyn-park-assault/). Authorities charged a suspect, 32-year-old Mario Riera-Arias, with attempted first-degree murder. In the early morning hours of Dec. 9, Gray returned home to his mother’s house in Brooklyn Park. Home security footage shows a man with a metal bat attacking Gray from behind as he walks up to the door. “We heard his car pull up, so we thought everything was fine. So a few minutes later we kept hearing a tick, tick, tick, and we just didn’t know what he was doing,” said Christine Lauretta, Gray’s mom. Lauretta and others rushed outside to find Gray unresponsive and chased the suspect away. “He was all bloody. It was really bad,” Lauretta said. “I was in disbelief. I didn’t know what to think or who would have done this.” Gray suffered skull fractures and severe groin injuries. Court documents say he was hit nearly 50 times with that bat. “For this guy to come out of nowhere and just try and kill him it’s just beyond me,” Lauretta said. Riera-Arias was later arrested and remains in custody on $1 million bail. Authorities believe Riera-Arias was estranged from his ex-wife and she was in some sort of relationship with Gray. “He didn’t know anything about this existing relationship that he was in, so had someone said something to him he would have backed off completely,” Lauretta said. Gray works as a detention deputy with the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, and now he’s trying to just do basic things like walk and talk. “Basically learning everything from scratch again,” Lauretta said.",

    "text": "Inside Prince George’s Bloody and ‘Gruesome’ Experience With Prince William at Balmoral Prince William and Kate Middleton’s oldest child, Prince George , is growing up so fast. The future king, 11, is slowly starting to come into his own as a royal. He’s attended a number of royal events alongside his parents, but he also makes appearances at sports games and other laid-back moments, too. This summer, George is joining his parents at Balmoral alongside his younger brother and sister, but there is reportedly a “gruesome” way he’ll bond with his father now that he’s getting older. Prince George could have blood on his face during this year’s Balmoral trip The royal family has a number of longtime traditions that have remained in place for years. Every year, the family takes a trip up to Balmoral in Scotland, where they spend the end of summer together and away from royal duties and the public eye. It’s become a way for all of them to reconnect. It’s not uncommon for the royals to take part in some hunting while on this trip. And in typical royal fashion, there is a longtime tradition that belongs to those who hunt for the first time: They must wear the blood of the first animal they kill on their face. According to Express , royal commentator Duncan Larcombe suggests that this could be the first year Prince George partakes in the tradition. “It was reported that he will join his father on a stag-hunting shoot while they visit the Balmoral estate this month,” Larcombe told Woman Magazine. “Traditionally, the blood of a hunter’s first kill is spread on their face, a ritual that goes back centuries.” Even Kate Middleton has reportedly been a part of the tradition, although Larcombe said that there was no word from the palace about whether or not this would be the year George joins. Prince William and Kate Middleton are trying to give Prince George a normal life George will someday be king, but William and Kate both want his upbringing to reflect the way Kate was raised. William spent a lot of time in the spotlight as a child, and he and Kate have both made clear that their children’s privacy comes first . William and Kate have slowly begun introducing their kids to the spotlight, but they are taking it one event at a time. George has been spotted at a couple of soccer games with his father, while Princess Charlotte recently accompanied her mother to Wimbledon. Prince Louis, though, is still a bit too young to be in the limelight, so he mostly sits out of the events, though he does make at least one annual appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony.",

    "text": "(Minghui.org) Los practicantes de Falun Dafa realizaron manifestaciones en una zona de mucho tráfico en Kuala Lumpur y frente a la Embajada de China el 10 de diciembre de 2023, Día Internacional de los Derechos Humanos. Le informaron a la gente sobre la persecución del Partido Comunista Chino (PCCh) y pidieron el fin de las brutalidades que ya duran 24 años. Practicantes se reunieron pacíficamente frente a la Embajada de China en Malasia el 10 de diciembre de 2023. Los practicantes leyeron una declaración tanto en chino como en malayo frente a la Embajada de China. Los practicantes se reunieron pacíficamente frente a la Embajada de China y pidieron al PCCh que pusiera fin a la persecución. Los practicantes de Falun Dafa (también conocido como Falun Gong) sostuvieron pancartas y leyeron una declaración tanto en chino como en malayo (el idioma malayo) condenando la persecución de 24 años del PCCh. Hicieron un llamado a personas de todos los ámbitos de la vida a prestar atención a la persecución sin precedentes y ayudar a poner fin a las atroces violaciones de derechos humanos. El representante de los practicantes leyó la siguiente declaración: “Los practicantes de Falun Gong en China han sido brutalmente perseguidos por el PCCh desde el 20 de julio de 1999. Los practicantes de Falun Gong en todo el mundo han resistido pacífica y racionalmente la persecución durante 24 años. Con motivo del Día Internacional de los Derechos Humanos, estamos hoy aquí para pedir al Partido Comunista Chino que detenga la persecución a Falun Gong. Hacemos un llamado a personas de todos los ámbitos de la vida para que aprendan sobre Falun Dafa y trabajen juntos para detener la brutal persecución del PCCh a Falun Gong”. Manifestación en el centro de Kuala Lumpur Los practicantes realizaron una manifestación en Bukit Bintang, la zona más concurrida de Kuala Lumpur el 9 de diciembre. Llamaron a la gente a aprender sobre Falun Dafa y ayudar a detener la persecución. La manifestación en Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, el 9 de diciembre, llama la atención de los transeúntes. Multitudes de personas pasaron por la manifestación la noche del 9 de diciembre. Los practicantes leyeron las declaraciones tanto en chino como en malayo. La Organización Mundial para Investigar la Persecución a Falun Gong (WOIPFG) ha llevado a cabo investigaciones durante casi 20 años y ha reunido muchas pruebas, lo que muestra que desde finales de 1999, el PCCh ha llevado a cabo [la sustracción de órganos](https://es.minghui.org/cc/8/) a practicantes vivos de Falun Gong. Jiang Zemin, exjefe del PCCh, emitió la orden y el PCCh patrocinó el genocidio y el crimen de lesa humanidad dirigido por el Estado. La manifestación recordó a la gente que debe resistir la infiltración de la ideología comunista en Malasia. Algunas personas dijeron que apreciaban a los practicantes por informarles sobre la persecución del PCCh y algunos los alentaron a continuar sus esfuerzos para crear conciencia. Durante el evento, un oficial de policía aceptó un volante de un practicante, quien le decía que el PCCh ha estado encubriendo estos crímenes y la gente sólo ve su propaganda. Muchas personas inocentes y amables fueron torturadas hasta la muerte por el PCCh e incluso sometidas a sustracción de órganos. El oficial de policía entendió la verdadera situación en China después de escuchar la explicación del practicante y le agradeció la información.

    "text": "Muhammad Irfan Published September 06, 2024 | 01:40 AM\nNew York, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Sep, 2024) Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, both daughters of billionaires, can set up an all-American US Open women 's final on Thursday, insisting that hard work and dedication rather than parental privilege have driven them to the peak of the sport.\nPegula knocked out world number one and 2022 champion Iga Swiatek in a crushing one-sided quarter-final to reach the last four at a Slam for the first time.\nNavarro, also into her first semi-final at a major, defeated defending champion Coco Gauff in the fourth round.\nAFP Sport looks ahead to Thursday's semi-finals at Flushing Meadows (x denotes seeding; 2300 GMT start):\nJessica Pegula ( USA x6) v Karolina Muchova (CZE)\nHead-to-head: Pegula leads 1-0\n-- After losing six Grand Slam quarter-finals, 30-year-old Pegula is into her maiden semi and has not dropped a set over five rounds.\nOn Wednesday, she knocked out top seed and four-time French Open champion Swiatek for the loss of just six games.\nIt was Pegula's fourth win on hard courts against the Pole -- after her three other wins she went on to claim the title.\n\"Finally, finally, I can say I'm a semi-finalist,\" said Pegula.\n\"To do it at prime time against the number one player in the world it's crazy, but I knew I could do it.\"\nAfter winning the Toronto title and finishing runner-up in Cincinnati , Pegula has won 14 of her 15 matches on the US hard court swing, including a three-set victory over Muchova in Cincinnati .\nHowever, she has found it almost impossible to separate her fortunes from those of father Terry Pegula who owns the Buffalo Bills NFL team as well as the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.\nForbes estimates the oil magnate's net worth to be $7.7 billion .\n\"I did some media thing the other day. They were, like, What's the most annoying thing?\" explained sixth-ranked Pegula who has made almost $15 million from her on-court career which has also yielded six titles.\n\"It's that people think I have a butler, that I get chauffeured around. I have a private limo, that I fly private everywhere. I'm definitely not like that.\"\nMuchova is in the semi-finals in New York for a second successive year.\nMuchova made the French Open final in 2023, rising to a career-high eighth in the world , before suffering a serious right wrist injury which required surgery.\nShe only returned in June this year.\n\"There were a few bad days, and then I always try to just regroup and focus on the step that I could do, what's the first step I can do towards recovery,\" she said.\nEmma Navarro ( USA x13) v Aryna Sabalenka (BLR x2)\nHead-to-head: 1-1\n-- Navarro lost the first round in both of her previous US Open appearances, but now the 23-year-old New Yorker is into her maiden Slam semi-final having knocked out defending champion Coco Gauff along the way.\nLike Pegula, Navarro has faced inevitable questions over her upbringing which included a private education .\nHer father is former Citigroup vice-president Ben Navarro, the founder of Sherman Financial Group whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $1.5 billion .\n\"I did have access to resources as a kid, but I don't want that to take away from the fact that I've worked really, really hard to be where I'm at,\" said Navarro.\n\"I've put a ton of hours in, and I started training twice a day and getting in the gym from the time I was eight, nine years old. It's been a ton of hard work and dedication.\"\nHer progress at the Slams this year has been on an upward curve -- third round in Melbourne , last 16 at Roland Garros, where she lost to Sabalenka, and quarter-finals at Wimbledon .\nThe Minsk-born but Florida-based Sabalenka will be playing in her fourth successive US Open semi-final and favourite to reach the championship match again having lost to Gauff 12 months ago.\nThe double Australian Open champion has dropped serve just four times at this year's tournament, winning 42 of her 46 service games.\nShe impressively demolished Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen for the loss of just three games in the quarter-finals.\n\"I'm going to try to put so much pressure on her (Navarro) and probably try to not let her do her stuff,\" said Sabalenka.\nDespite the weapons at her disposal, Sabalenka's fastest serve of the tournament of 189.9 km/h (118 mph) was matched by Navarro in the first round.",
