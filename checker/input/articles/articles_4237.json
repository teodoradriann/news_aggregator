    "title": "Karnataka stampede report mentions Virat Kohli: 'RCB did not consult police before inviting people'",
    "text": "The Karnataka government has stated in its report to the High Court that the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) invited people for a victory parade to Chinnaswamy stadium &quot;unilaterally&quot; and &quot;without consultation/ permission&quot; from city police, according to a report by NDTV. The Karnataka High Court has ordered the state government to release the stampede report concerning the stampede outside Chinnaswamy Stadium that took place on June 4 and claimed 11 lives. The court ordered disclosure to the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), and DNA Entertainment Networks. According to the report, the RCB management contacted police on June 3, the same day that RCB won the IPL. The report stated that this was an intimation and not a requisition for permission as required under the law. It alleged that no applications in the prescribed formats were submitted to the licensing authority by the applicant/organiser. “In the absence of such information required under the prescribed formats, it was not possible for the licence-granting authority to consider the request positively. Accordingly, the PI of the Cubbon Park Police Station did not grant the permission to the request made by KSCA on 03.06.2025 at around 6.30 pm, due to a lack of information regarding the expected approximate gathering, arrangements made, possible bottlenecks, and the like, for both possible outcomes of the final match, i.e., whether RCB won or lost,&quot; the report stated as quoted by NDTV. The report also stated that the RCB, without consulting the police, posted a photo at 7.01 am the next day on its official social media handles, &quot;informing that there is free entry for people and inviting the public to participate in the Victory Parade, which would commence at Vidhana Soudha and conclude at Chinnaswamy Stadium&quot;. Another post was made at 8 am, reiterating this information. &quot;Subsequently, on 04.06.2025, at 8:55 am, the RCB shared a video clip of Mr. Virat Kohli, a prominent player of the RCB team, on RCB's official handle @Rcbtweets on X, in which he stated that the team intended to celebrate this victory with the people of Bengaluru city and RCB fans on 04.06.2025 in Bengaluru,&quot; the report stated. According to the report, the posts by the RCB handles got a combined 44 lakh views.\",",

    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region.\nIn a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana.\nMr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country.\nHe argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations.\n“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders.\n“This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.”\nVenezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores.\nThe region has been under Guyana’s control for decades.\nBut in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.\nAs tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means.\nDuring the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country.\nOn Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled.\n“Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital.\nHMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa.\nIt can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones.\nThe ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana.\nAuthorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores.\nThe UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces.\nThe nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "title": "Taylor Swift attendance record: Comparing pop star to an average Chiefs fan",
    "text": "If the Chiefs are playing, chances are Taylor Swift is in the stands and that's a very good thing for Kansas City fans. By Ian Levy | 3:36 PM EDT\nSuper Bowl LVIII - San Francisco 49ers v Kansas City Chiefs / Ezra Shaw/GettyImages\nTaylor Swift became an indelible part of the NFL experience last season, as her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce completely jumped the shark . They began dating early in the season and he presence at Chiefs games throughout the season brought plenty of new fans and attention to what was already the most popular sport in the US.\nWhile some fans may have been exhausted by all the shots of her in the stands and the repeated predictions of whether or not she would be in attendance each week, she was clearly good for the game and, you could argue, pretty good for the Chiefs.\nWhich Chiefs games did Taylor Swift attend in 2023? Swift attended 13 Chiefs games during the 2023 season, and more often than not, she was there for a Chiefs win.\nDATE\nOPPONENT\nRESULT\nSept. 24, 2023\nvs. Bears\nW, 41-10\nOct. 1, 2023\nat Jets\nW, 23-20\nOct. 12, 2023\nvs. Broncos\nW, 19-8\nOct. 22, 2023\nvs. Chargers\nW, 31-17\nDec. 3, 2023\nat Packers\nL, 27-19\nDec. 10, 2023\nvs. Bills\nL, 20-17\nDec. 17, 2023\nat Patriots\nW, 27-17\nDec. 25, 2023\nvs. Raiders\nL, 20-14\nDec. 31, 2023\nvs. Bengals\nW, 25-17\nJan. 13, 2024\nvs. Dolphins\nW, 26-7\nJan. 21, 2024\nat Bills\nW, 27-24\nJan. 28, 2024\nat Ravens\nW, 17-10\nFeb. 11, 2024\nvs. 49ers\nW, 25-22\nIn all, the Chiefs were 10-3 last season in games attended by Swift, outscoring opponents by a total of 92 points. They were 5-2 in home games attended by Swift and 5-1 in road or neutral site games. From the time she attended her first game and their relationship was underway, she missed just five games of a possible 18 games.\nIt goes without saying but they were much better off when she was there, going just 1-3 in the four games she did not attend last season.\nWill Taylor Swift be at Chiefs 2024 season-opener? According to The Athletic, Taylor Swift will be in attendance on Thursday, Sept. 5 as the Chiefs unveil their championship banner and begin their quest for a three-pear against the Baltimore Ravens.\nTaylor Swift’s Chiefs era is continuing.\nThe pop star will attend Thursday’s NFL season opener between Kansas City and the Baltimore Ravens to cheer on her boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a source tells The Athletic.\nMore ⤵️ https://t.co/xRFXfjkLCJ\n— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) September 5, 2024 Swift is also likely to be in the stands for much of the early portion of the Chiefs schedule with a break in her Eras Tour schedule until Oct. 18 when she resumes in Miami. She'll be playing more than a dozen dates in North America across the rest of October, November and into December but even then she should be able to catch a handful of games in person.\nWhich 2024 Chiefs games will Taylor Swift be at? DATE\nCHIEFS GAME LOCATION\nTAYLOR TOUR LOCATION\nSept. 5\nHome vs. Ravens\n-\nSept. 15\nHome vs. Bengals\n-\nSept. 22\nat Atlanta Falcons\n-\nSept. 29\nat Los Angeles Chargers\n-\nOct. 7\nHome vs. Saints\n-\nOct. 20\nat San Francisco 49ers\nMiami\nOct. 27\nat Las Vegas Raiders\nNew Orleans\nNov. 4\nHome vs. Buccaneers\nIndianapolis (Nov. 3)\nNov. 10\nHome vs. Broncos\n-\nNov. 17\nat Buffalo Bills\nToronto (Nov. 16)\nNov. 24\nat Carolina Panthers\nToronto (Nov. 23)\nNov. 29\nHome vs. Raiders\n-\nDec. 8\nHome vs. Chargers\nVancouver\nDec. 15\nat Cleveland Browns\n-\nDec. 21\nHome vs. Texans\n-\nDec. 25\nat Pittsburgh Steelers\n-\nJan. 5\nat Denver Broncos\n-\nTaylor Swift's current tour dates only overlap with the Chiefs schedule on three dates — Week 7 when the Chiefs are in San Francisco and Taylor is in Miami, Week 8 when the Chiefs in Las Vegas and she's in New Orleans and Week 14 when the Chiefs are in Kansas City and she's in Vancouver.\nIn addition, there are there other dates where the Chiefs play and she has a concert the day before and might not be able to make it. Of those, Week 11 is the most likely option for her to attend, coming off a show in Toronto with the Chiefs playing right across Lake Ontario in Buffalo.\nAssuming the relationship lasts and assuming she doesn't get tired of watching the Chiefs pound their opponents each week, Swift could be in attendance for as many as 13 games this season. If that works out like it did last year — 10-3 record in those games and a run through the playoffs — the average Chiefs fan should be very happy.\nfeed\nRelated Topics Kansas NFL News Kansas City Chiefs Baltimore Ravens Home / Kansas City Chiefs",
