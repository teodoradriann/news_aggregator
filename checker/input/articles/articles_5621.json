    "title": "4 men charged in connection with 2021 mass shooting at El Mula banquet hall in Miami-Dade",
    "text": "Miami-Dade Police conducted an overnight raid Thursday, taking three men into custody while a fourth was charged for their role in the deadly mass shooting outside the El Mula banquet hall in May of 2021.\n“So today we’re announcing the arrests of four individuals for these murders and shootings,” Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.\nThe suspects were identified as Allen Gregory Chambers, Jr., Willie Zavon Hill, Eugene Anthony Holmes and Jacarree Brian Green. Hill is already in federal custody serving time for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nProsecutors charged all four men with three counts of first-degree murder, 20 counts of attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Hill is facing an additional charge for allegedly attempting to dispose of the white Nissan Pathfinder used in the crime.\nFernandez Rundle said the men went to El Mula that night to target members of a rival gang as the banquet hall hosted an album release party on May 30, 2021.\nVideo shows masked gunmen run from a stolen white Nissan Pathfinder, opening fire and killing 32-year-old Shanique Peterson, 26-year-old Desmond Owens and 26-year-old Clayton Dillard III.\n“This attack was a planned assault. The targets included those who alleged attackers identified as rival gang members,” Fernandez Rundle said.\nAccording to an arrest warrant, cell phone and GPS records established Holmes as the driver of the Pathfinder, and Green as the driver of a black Cadillac, and revealed Hill and Chambers as gunmen who exited that car.\n“In total, the police recovered 99 spent shell casings,” Fernandez Rundle said, “Forensic analysis revealed that the casings were shot from nine different firearms.”\nInvestigators also said video from Holmes’ cell phone taken just hours after the shooting shows him and another subject bragging about the crime.\nThe violence prompted the county to launch what they called “Operation Summer Heat,” a partnership with local, state and federal law enforcement. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said it was so effective, it became permanent.\n“It led to a longer-term effort called ‘Operation Community Shield,'” Levine Cava said. “Working together, we took over 3,000 illegal guns off the street.”\nThese are not the first arrests in this case. In November, Davonte Barnes was sentenced to life in prison for his role as a lookout in the shooting.\nIn 2021, police also arrested Warneric Buckner for his suspected role in the shooting—Buckner was identified as one of the men in the Pathfinder, but prosecutors had to drop charges after they said detectives improperly got a confession after he asked for attorney.\nBuckner was also charged in connection with the murder of 6 year-old Chassidy Saunders in 2021. He pleaded not guilty in that case, which is ongoing.\n“We, as a law enforcement community, vow that this investigation will continue until everyone who can be charged is charged,” said Fernandez Rundle.\nProsecutors said this investigation remains open and ongoing.",

Que si se saliera mucho del guión le quitarían ipso facto. Encima de que es español y de vez en cuando cosas como ésta nos lo echamos al cuello.

Ambos personajes tienen una amplia trayectoria de felonías contrastadas. Me limito a expresar que su supuesto apoyo a la población palestina en este contexto es completamente falsa y que el interés que tienen en hacer estas declaraciones es pura y simplemente lavar un poco su maltrecha imagen.\n[#16](c16#c-16) y si dices que sin tan malos pa que iban a querer ponerse en contra a países poderosos?

    "title": "Thousands rally across Pakistan to demand humanitarian corridor for Gaza",
    "text": "Thousands across Pakistan took to the streets on Sunday to show solidarity with the Palestinians and call for an immediate halt to the ongoing violence in Gaza. In a series of coordinated protests led by Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), a key religiopolitical group, citizens from Islamabad, Karachi, and other major cities demanded the international community intervene to stop what they termed the ' genocide ' in Gaza. With over 31,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, reported dead since October 7, the rallies underscored the escalating humanitarian crisis and the urgent need for international action.\nAdvertisment Mass Mobilization Against Israeli Actions In the capital city of Islamabad, a significant crowd, including families, gathered at the iconic D chowk before marching toward Serena Chowk, brandishing banners and Palestinian flags while chanting anti-Israel and pro-Palestine slogans. JI chief Siraj-ul-Haq condemned the U.S. for its support of Israel, drawing parallels between the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the current Israeli bombardment of Gaza. He also announced plans for a protest march to the U.S. Embassy, slated for the last Friday of Ramadan, criticizing the silence of Muslim rulers and praising global citizens who stood with Palestinians.\nKarachi's Call for Action Advertisment In Karachi, the commercial heart of Pakistan, thousands marched along M.A. Jinnah Road, voicing their demands for a cease-fire and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for Gaza. JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman led the rally, questioning the absence of support from Palestine's allies and lamenting the provision of weapons and aid to Israel by the U.S., UK, and their allies. The demonstrators' slogans, \" Aqsa we are here ,\" \"Gaza we are here,\" and \"Stop genocide in Gaza,\" echoed throughout the city, signaling a strong collective demand for immediate peace and support for the besieged enclave.\nHumanitarian Crisis Deepens The Israeli offensive has resulted in the death of over 31,000 Palestinians and injured more than 72,600, leading to widespread destruction and a dire shortage of necessities. A crippling blockade imposed by Israel has pushed the majority of Gaza's population, especially those in the north, towards starvation. According to the UN, 85% of Gaza's population is now internally displaced, facing acute shortages of food, clean water, and medicine, with 60% of the enclave's infrastructure damaged or destroyed. Amidst these escalating tensions, Israel faces accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice, with an interim ruling demanding Tel Aviv cease its genocidal acts and ensure humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\nAs the international community watches closely, the rallies in Pakistan serve as a poignant reminder of the global solidarity with the Palestinian cause and the widespread call for an immediate end to the violence. These demonstrations not only showcase the deep-rooted support for Palestinians but also highlight the growing international pressure on Israel to halt its military actions and engage in meaningful peace negotiations. With the situation in Gaza deteriorating rapidly, the world awaits decisive action to prevent further loss of innocent lives and to pave the way for a lasting resolution to the conflict.",

    "text": "Ciudad de México, 18 abr (EFE).- La Asociación Mexicana de Empresas de Capital Humano (AMECH) apoyó este jueves la ampliación del permiso por paternidad remunerado en México, un elemento importante para el \"impulso del desarrollo profesional de las mujeres\" y de una sociedad \"más igualitaria\".\nEn un comunicado, la organización respaldó que estas licencias pasen de los cinco días actuales a los 20, una medida que la Cámara de Diputados aprobó el pasado diciembre como una reforma de la Ley del Trabajo.\n\"Representa un avance significativo en materia de derechos laborales y equidad de género. Mejora la retención de talento en empresas al demostrar compromiso con la conciliación laboral\", destacó.\nAseguró que permite a las mujeres \"contar con un mayor apoyo durante los primeros días de crianza\" e \"impacta positivamente en lo laboral y económico\".\nEn opinión de la AMECH, el crecimiento de la participación femenina entre 2005 y 2023, que aumentó cinco puntos porcentuales, \"ha sido mínimo\".\nSegún la Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo, el 76,1 % de los hombres estaban en el mercado laboral en el tercer trimestre de 2023 frente al 46,4 % de las mujeres.\nSin embargo, el presidente mexicano, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pidió a mediados de marzo aplazar hasta después de las elecciones del 2 de junio distintas discusiones en el Congreso de la Unión, también la que aprobaría de manera definitiva este aumento.\nActualmente, la reforma se encuentra entre los temas pendientes en el Senado.\nDe hecho, la organización reconoció la \"controversia\" que ha sobrevolado esta ampliación, concretamente por las reticencias expresadas por organismos públicos como el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social o la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP), que pidieron reducir la propuesta a 10 días.\nLa falta de definición de López Obrador sobre estos temas ha generado polémica, en especial porque ha respaldado otras iniciativas laborales, como el aumento del salario mínimo, reformas al sistema de pensiones y la eliminación del “outsourcing” o subcontratación.\n\"La ampliación del permiso por paternidad emerge como una necesidad urgente\", advirtió la AMECH, que apremió al Estado y al empresariado a \"reconocer este derecho y a colaborar para su efectiva implementación\".

    "text": "Gang threatens liquor contractor, demands Rs 50L ransom\nA gang has reportedly demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh from a liquor contractor in Yamunanagar district. It has also threatened the contractor with dire consequences if he failed to fulfil the demand.\nOn the complaint of the contractor, Rinku Rana of Golni village of the district, a case has been registered against the gang members at Chhappar police station.\nThe complainant told the police that he had been working as a liquor contractor in the district for the past four-five years.\nHe alleged that gangster Virender Pratap, alias Kala Rana of Yamunanagar, had demanded a ransom of Rs 20 lakh from him in lieu of running liquor vends about three years ago, but he had refused to pay the amount.\nKala Rana's brother Surya Pratap, alias Noni Rana, and Sunny, active members of the gang, had fled abroad illegally and were operating the gang from there, he said.\n“On April 6, 2025, I received two WhatsApp calls on my phone at 10.35 pm from a foreign number, which I did not pick up. After that, I received five consecutive messages, threatening to kill me and my family if I did not pick up the phone,” he told the police.\nAt 10.52 pm, he received a WhatsApp call from the same number, which he picked up. “The caller identified himself as Noni Rana and said, 'You have escaped twice before. You have neither contributed your share in liquor contracts nor have you paid the money we demanded. Your three companions have already been killed. Now, it is your turn and that of your family. If you want to be safe, give Rs 50 lakh to Tarun Singari and Manish Singari within three days',” the complainant told the police.\nHe further said, “The caller also told me that if I told anyone, there would be consequences.”\nShots were fired at Rinku Rana's liquor vend in Harnaul village of Yamunanagar district on Tuesday. The vend was closed and seven-eight bullets hit the shutter. Rajesh Kumar, incharge of police post, Khera Lakkha Singh village, said the incident took place around 11.30 pm.",

    "text": "Mar 29, 2024, 08:39 PM IST Easter 2024 falls on 31st March. It celebrates Jesus Christ's resurrection from the dead, as described in the New Testament of the Bible. It is the most important event in Christianity, symbolising the victory of life over death and the promise of salvation. Easter is celebrated worldwide with various traditions. Many people attend church services, participate in feasts, and engage in Easter egg hunts and other activities symbolising new life and rebirth. Easter eggs and the Easter Bunny are common symbols associated with the holiday, representing new life and fertility. The Easter egg hunt is a popular activity for children, while adults often exchange Easter eggs as gifts. For Christians, Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, a pivotal event in Christian theology symbolising hope and redemption. Different cultures have unique ways of celebrating Easter. In some regions, there are processions, reenactments of the Passion of Christ and other religious and cultural events.
