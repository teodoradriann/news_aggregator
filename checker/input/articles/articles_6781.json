    "title": "IU honored with National Historic Chemical Landmark for advancing oral health: IU News",
    "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — The invention of stannous fluoride toothpaste marked a turning point in oral health and became a point of pride for Indiana University. Nearly 70 years after IU chemistry and dentistry researchers pioneered the formula that led to the development of Crest toothpaste, the [IU Department of Chemistry](https://www.chem.indiana.edu/) was honored with a [National Historic Chemical Landmark](https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/crest.html) designation from the American Chemical Society on April 4. The [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/) is one of the world’s largest scientific organizations and leading sources of authoritative scientific information. The organization’s [National Historic Chemical Landmark Program](https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/about.html) presents historical markers, granting landmark status to locations where groundbreaking achievements in chemical sciences took place. The permanent plaque for IU will be displayed at the southeast entrance of the Department of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences in Bloomington. Procter & Gamble, the company that commercialized stannous fluoride toothpaste under the product name Crest, received a landmark at its headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. “The creation of the chemistry that ushered in Crest toothpaste in 1955 is representative of IU’s long record of translating research to impact countless lives,” IU President Pamela Whitten said. “This recognition from the American Chemical Society is not only a reminder of the remarkable achievement that took place at this university, but also underscores IU’s commitment to multidisciplinary research that addresses society’s most critical needs.” IU has a long history of collaborating with industry partners to bring research to market. Stannous fluoride development is just one of the ways the university uses these partnerships to improve lives around the globe. For example, research conducted by Department of Chemistry faculty in partnership with a biotechnology startup led to the [creation of injectable glucagon](https://college.indiana.edu/research/featured-research/dimarchi.html), a hormone that regulates blood sugar. In 1991, [IU School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.iu.edu/index.html) researchers led the development of [DentaShield](https://www.hartz.com/dentashield-reduces-the-tartar-that-can-cause-dog-breath/), a formula licensed to pet product producer Hartz to reduce tartar on dogs’ teeth. How IU innovation changed dental hygiene Dental caries, or cavities, increased significantly around the world as the Industrial Revolution increased the availability of refined sugar and flour. At this time, the most common fix for decaying teeth was extraction. Cavities were so prevalent that before the development of fluoride toothpaste, the U.S. Army had to waive its requirement that soldiers have a minimum of six incisor teeth and six molar teeth to enlist because they had trouble finding 18-year-olds who still had 12 out of 32 teeth during World War II. By the late 1940s, research had shown that those with levels of naturally occurring fluoride in their municipal drinking water were less susceptible to cavities. A team of IU researchers sought to take this knowledge and create a shelf stable fluoride ion that would be compatible with existing toothpaste formulas. [Harry G. Day](https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/awards/honoree/885.html) to find a way to prevent tooth decay and discovered that stannous fluoride made tooth enamel more resistant to acid than any other combination of chemical compounds. Muhler presented their findings at a dental convention, which caught the attention of [Verling M. Votaw](https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/awards/honoree/2447.html), IU School of Dentistry graduate and Procter & Gamble’s director of product research. Procter & Gamble funded their research with the hopes of producing and distributing a final product if one was discovered. One year later, Muhler and Day began working with IU chemistry professor [William Nebergall](https://www.invent.org/inductees/william-nebergall), who found a way to deliver the fluoride ions into a toothpaste. By 1952, clinical trials began in the Bloomington community. More than 12,000 adults and children showcased the toothpaste formula’s efficacy in preventing cavities. Studies showed that using the stannous fluoride toothpaste reduced the number of cavities by 30% compared to a control group. In 1956, the toothpaste was sold nationwide; by 1960, the American Dental Association presented Crest its first Seal of Acceptance. IU was granted a patent for the discovery, which was then licensed to Procter & Gamble. The university received royalties from the patent until it expired in 1975, and a portion of those funds was used to establish the [Oral Health Research Institute](https://dentistry.iu.edu/research/oral-health-research-institute/index.html) at the School of Dentistry in 1968. Today, the institute continues as an internationally recognized oral health product testing laboratory. [Media Kit: Access video and photos of the recognition ceremony](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/msteams_af0842/EvZjepSlawtFhnfkjrZhSqoBo23qVZ5xl9kHPHUKsJVbiw?e=4Q6uRB) What they are saying “This outstanding recognition is a testament to how academic-industry partnerships fuel research innovation within the College and across IU, leading to discoveries that positively impact millions. Indeed, the fundamental, department-level work by IU chemistry professors at the time provided the building blocks for collaboration with IU Dentistry, which in turn led to the commercialization of Crest toothpaste by Procter & Gamble, transforming oral hygiene and global public health.” — Rick Van Kooten, executive dean of the College of Arts and Sciences “Some health care innovations are so dramatic, so effective and so widely adopted that it is hard for those living after their development to conceive of what the world was like before they existed. The development of stannous fluoride toothpaste at Indiana University is one of those innovations. Following the introduction of stannous fluoride toothpaste, the prevalence of cavities dropped by more than 75%. Today, researchers and clinicians at the School of Dentistry and our Oral Health Research Institute continue to innovate new treatments and test new products to advance oral health care for all. From new formulations of toothpaste and mouth rinses, to developing a cavity-fighting chewing gum that can be used when toothbrushing is not feasible, we are proud to build upon the history of innovation at Indiana University to bring on tomorrow.” — Carol Anne Murdoch-Kinch, dean of IU School of Dentistry “It is amazing to think of the impact IU students and faculty have had in improving the lives of billions of people around the world. Research in the Department of Chemistry more than 70 years ago led to dramatic advances in global oral health. Today, this tradition continues with current research in areas of chemistry that impact human health, energy, materials, medicine, information and measurement science. Students, scientists and faculty at IU make a difference in advancing knowledge and technology that benefit our global society.” — Steven L. Tait, Herman T. Briscoe Professor of Chemistry and chair of the Department of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences “The collaborative development of stannous fluoride which is foundational to Crest toothpaste is a lasting testament to the power of bringing together institutions that share a mission of using the highest quality science for the good of society. Receiving this landmark honor at P&G yesterday and now here at Indiana University brings us great pride and provides inspiration for continuing our work bringing irresistibly superior products to market.” — Gerard Baillely, senior vice president of corporate research and development at Procter & Gamble “Following its introduction, fluoride toothpastes have improved the dental health of millions worldwide by putting powerful cavity-fighting chemistry in the hands of consumers, and that is a legacy to be proud of. We are excited to honor IU and P&G for their transformative work, which affirms the power of academic-industrial partnerships.” — Mary K. Carroll, American Chemical Society president and an IU alumna",

    "text": "HATTIESBURG, MS — Local man Don Richardson revealed himself to be utterly dead inside after failing to shed a single tear while the congregation of First Baptist Church sang \"O Holy Night\".\n\"Given the circumstance, it's hard to say if Don is now, or ever was, human,\" said fellow congregant Chad McMath. \"I mean, 'Long lay the world in sin and error pining, till He appeared and the soul felt its worth'. It's too much, man.\"\nThe spirit of every other man, woman and child stirred inside while they proclaimed the breaking of a new and glorious morn, betraying the unmoved Richardson as a heartless ghoul. \"Maybe he's deaf,\" wondered pew mate Stan Hillner. \"He's either deaf, or a serial killer. I really hope he's deaf.\"\nPraise rang forth from the congregation over the King of Kings laid in a lowly manger, born to be our friend in every trial. As other worshippers wept through the declaration of brotherhood with the slave, whose chains Christ will break, it became steadily more apparent that Richardson was some sort of soulless creature of the netherworld.\n\"That's just not natural,\" declared Pastor Rob Patterson after the service. \"Better call the Catholic church down the street to come see about an exorcism.\"\nAs the country slowly increases in racism and right-wing bigotry, it’s important to ensure you don’t get caught up in their evil MAGA ways.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more tactical instruction",

    "text": "Voluntarios de distintas partes de Estados Unidos se han desplegado en las comunidades afectadas por las inundaciones ocurridas en Texas tras las intensas lluvias del 3 y 4 de julio, sumándose como apoyo a las labores de rescate y reconstrucción.\nEl siniestro, que dejó entre 12.7 y 27.9 centímetros de lluvia acumulada, provocó más de 170 personas desaparecidas y al menos 120 fallecidas, además de múltiples destrozos en la región de Hill Country, Texas.\nLa magnitud de la tragedia motivó a personas de ciudades cercanas y de otros estados a ofrecer ayuda voluntaria.\nA pocos kilómetros del Campamento Mystic, donde 16 niñas murieron y otras 11 permanecen desaparecidas, un grupo de trabajadores de la construcción de origen mexicano decidió suspender sus compromisos laborales para colaborar con las tareas de limpieza y reparación.\n“Escuchamos en las noticias que hacían falta voluntarios y decidimos venir. Son cosas que no ves a flor de piel. Es distinto cómo te lo cuentan a verlo. Es algo que te deja en pausa”, relató uno de los obreros, originario de Guanajuato.\nContó también que, para él, ayudar en esta situación ha significado cruzar puentes con personas que en otro contexto podrían haberlo discriminado por su nacionalidad.\nEn otro vecindario, también devastado por la crecida del río, once hombres que recientemente salieron de prisión se unieron a las tareas de ayuda humanitaria. Lo hicieron como parte de su proceso de reintegración social, acompañados por Danny Stone, director de la organización Restoration of Hope, que impulsa el cambio mediante trabajo comunitario y apoyo espiritual.\n“Estas personas están en un proceso de transformación. Ayudar aquí les da propósito y una oportunidad de contribuir positivamente. Muchas veces la sociedad los juzga por su pasado, pero hoy están demostrando que pueden ser agentes de ayuda y cambio”, señaló Stone.",

    "text": "Former top Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon was ordered by a federal judge on Thursday to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.\nBannon, 70, was convicted of contempt in July 2022 for defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021 , attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\nOne of the masterminds behind Trump 's successful 2016 presidential campaign, he was sentenced to four months in prison in October 2022, but has remained free while appealing against his conviction.\nRead More Opinion: Donald Trump is a convict. Voters will decide whether it matters Will Donald Trump's guilty verdict affect his 2024 election odds? A US federal appeals court upheld the conviction last month.\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols revoked Bannon's bail at a court hearing on Thursday and ordered him to report to prison in three weeks.\nA defiant Bannon addressed reporters outside the Washington court after the judge's order, saying: “There's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up.\"\n“There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up.\n“We're going to win on November 5 in an amazing landslide.\"\nThat date is the presidential election expected to be a rematch between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden.\nAnother top Trump adviser, Peter Navarro , was also convicted of contempt of Congress and began serving a four-month sentence in a Florida prison in March.\nSteve Bannon speaks to The National in a September 2022 interview in which he predicted Donald Trump would win the presidency in 2024. The National Navarro, 74, is the highest-ranking former member of the Trump administration to be jailed for actions stemming from the Republican former president's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\nBannon served in the White House as chief strategist for the first seven months of Trump's term, leaving reportedly due to conflicts with other top staff members.\nIn 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors towards the construction of a border wall with Mexico.\nWhile others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon for Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him.\nTrump was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on March 4 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Mr Biden.\nBut his trial has been put on hold until the US Supreme Court rules on his claim that as a former president he is immune from prosecution.\nTrump, 77, was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after the Capitol riot – he was charged with inciting an insurrection – but was acquitted by the Senate.\nUpdated: June 06, 2024, 8:29 PM",

    "text": "Quarterback Tyler Shough 'Fastest-Rising' NFL Draft Prospect: Pittsburgh Steelers Visit\nFormer\nOregon Ducks quarterback Tyler Shough continues to stand out in the eyes of general managers and scouts as the 2025 NFL Draft gets closer.\nShough surprised at the\nNFL Combine with a 4.54 40-yard dash, finishing only .13 of a second slower than former Ducks wide receiver Tez Johnson. While this certainly is a feather in his draft hat, it's clear that teams are having increased interest in more than Shough's speed. His all-around potential has him climbing up draft boards. According to NFL on FOX insider Jordan Schultz, Shough is \"one of the fastest-rising prospects in the draft.\" Multiple teams are still set to meet with him before the draft, including the Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks, per reports from ESPN.

With the draft just over a month away, his buzz keeps building.\"\nDuring a recent interview with\nNFL Network's Rich Eisen, Shough said he headed into the 40-yard dash looking to have some fun while other players appeared more tense.\n\"I wanted to go out there and have fun and compete, man,\"\nShough told Eisen. \"I think that's what we came there to do. And I knew, obviously I ran faster than what I was anticipating to run, but I knew I was going to go out there and have fun and compete regardless. That was my whole mindset. This is the only time you get to do this. It was just a blessing to be there honestly for me and my story.\n\"Everybody's kind of coming in there super tight, you know, 'I'm like, Man, it's like dead silent in here. Let's get everybody going.\"\nShough's time with the Ducks came during the 2019 and 2020 seasons. In Eugene, he went 118 of 182 passing for 1,703 yards, 16 touchdowns and six interceptions. During the pandemic season in 2020, Shough led Oregon to the Pac-12 Championship, taking down the USC Trojans in a 31-24 win. He finished that season completing 106 of 167 passes for 1,559 yards, 13 touchdowns and six picks.\nShough then made his way to the Texas panhandle to Lubbock, joining the\nTexas Tech Red Raiders. He played three seasons with Texas Tech, even getting a chance to face his former Oregon team in a 38-30 loss to the Ducks at AT&T Stadium during the 2023 season.\nThis past season, he suited up for the Louisville Cardinals and it ended up being a career-best year. Shough finished 244 of 389 passing for 3,195 yards and 23 touchdowns -- all career-high marks -- to go along with six interceptions.",

    "text": "THE Easter weekend is a time where Christians go to the church and celebrate the death and resurrection of their king, Jesus Christ. However, not everyone will go to church during that weekend. The Ingoma yePhasika Festival wants to accommodate those people by creating a platform for them to worship and praise God through traditional dance music. The traditional dance festival will see 10 groups from Durban performing at kaXimba in Mkhambathini, west of Durban on Saturday, 30 March. Speaking to Daily Sun, event organiser Ngqengelele Khomo said: “We want those who won’t attend the Easter church services to come to Ingoma yePhasika to worship God and Jesus with their dancing talent. Others will enjoy witnessing others dancing because God is worshiped in many ways. “This is not actually a competition but is just a festival where 10 groups will share the stage. Fans will be the ones who will judge who is the best while they will enjoy meat as we are going to slaughter a number of cows,” he said. ALSO READ: [Reality star: Be careful what you wish for!](Reality star: Be careful what you wish for!) He said another reason they're hosting this festival is to encourage the youth to be proud of their culture and heritage. “We encourage those who will attend it to dress traditionally, according to their culture and heritage. “We've hosted this festival three times since we started it in 2019, and we're seeing improvement every year,” he said. He said the event will be attended by guests from eThekwini and Mkhambathini municipalities, as well as councillors, izinduna and amakhosi. The event will start at 1pm and continue until late.

    "title": "Treasury Refunded More Than $135 Million In Advanced Tax EV Rebates Since January",
    "text": "Customers have made more than 17,500 advanced payment requests for new electric vehicles.\nThe United States government has refunded $135 million to car dealers nationwide, the Treasury said this week. This covers the advanced EV tax credit payments made since the start of the year through February 6.\nSince January 1, buyers can transfer these credits to the car dealer when purchasing a vehicle, lowering the price by as much as $7,500. Before 2024, the new EV tax credit ($4,000 for used EVs) was only available when buyers filed their tax returns the following year.\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), more than 25,000 time-of-sale reports have been logged, with more than 78% of those filed with advance payment requests. A total of 17,500 new EVs and 2,000 used examples are among the vehicles for which customers have made advanced payment requests.\nTreasury says more than 11,000 car dealerships have registered for the program, with more than 8,000 registering to do advanced payments.\nTo qualify, consumers must meet the income limit requirements for tax credits when purchasing the vehicle. Otherwise, they have to pay the incentive back when filing taxes. The adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals. This applies to new vehicles, though.\n\"One month into [the] implementation of this provision, there is strong demand for this new upfront discount, which will continue [the] momentum in growing this industry in the United States,\" said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo.\nSeveral electric vehicles recently lost their tax credits after the government\nchanged the rules for eligibility. As a result, only a handful of EVs still qualify for the credit, including the Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford F-150 Lightning.\nNot everyone is happy about the new tax credit rules. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation has\nasked the Treasury to relax these regulations in order to speed up the adoption of electric vehicles. The latest battery sourcing rules stipulate that an EV's battery may not contain materials sourced from foreign entities of concern, including China and Russia. As a result, multiple electric cars have lost out on their incentives, potentially putting off scores of customers.\nTo counter these changes, General Motors offered customers a $7,500\ndiscount on certain electric vehicles to make up for the fact that they are no longer eligible for the tax credit. However, this will only last for \"early 2024,\" with GM not stipulating when the deal would end.\nIt will be interesting to see how much more money the Treasury pays out to dealers in advanced payments for the rest of the year.",
