    "text": "EYEN | 1 hour ago A review of study data by an independent Data Review Committee found that CHAPERONE is not meeting its primary three-year efficacy endpoint\nCompany to discontinue study, review full data set, and evaluate next steps for the program\nNEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eyenovia, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYEN), an ophthalmic technology company, today announced that a review of the CHAPERONE data by an independent Data Review Committee (DRC) found that the trial is not meeting its primary endpoint of a less than 0.5 diopter progression in visual acuity over three years. CHAPERONE is Eyenovia&CloseCurlyQuote;s Phase 3 study evaluating its proprietary drug-device combination of low-dose atropine in the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Optejet dispensing platform as a potential treatment for pediatric progressive myopia.\nThe DRC reviewed the safety and efficacy data from 252 evaluable patients. The DRC found that the rate of myopia progression was not significantly different between the two active treatment arms (0.01% and 0.1% atropine ophthalmic metered spray) and placebo. In the safety analysis, all dosages and placebo appeared to be well-tolerated, with a mild and infrequent adverse event profile. Full study data has not yet been released to Eyenovia.\n“We are disappointed that the DRC determined that the CHAPERONE study does not appear to be meeting its primary efficacy endpoint,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; stated Michael Rowe, Chief Executive Officer of Eyenovia. “We plan to terminate the study, review the data more thoroughly, and evaluate next steps. On behalf of the entire company, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the children, parents, caregivers and healthcare professionals who participated in this trial, as well as all the Eyenovia team members for their exceptional work on this program.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;\nIn light of the results of this review, the Company is considering a variety of steps to maximize value to all stakeholders, to reduce expenses and to evaluate its strategic options, which may include a business combination, reverse merger, asset sales or a combination of those alternatives. Further information will be made available once the evaluation of strategic options has been completed.\nAbout Eyenovia, Inc.\nEyenovia, Inc.

    "title": "Israel ready to let ships bring aid to Gaza’s shores – minister",
    "text": "By Dan Williams\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israel is prepared to let ships deliver aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip “immediately” as part of a proposed sea corridor from Cyprus, the Israeli foreign minister said on Sunday, naming four European countries as potential participants.\nUnder the arrangement first suggested by Nicosia in November, cargo would undergo security inspection in the Cypriot port of Larnaca before being ferried to the Gaza coast, 370 km (230 miles) away, rather than through neighbouring Egypt or Israel.\nIf the plan goes ahead, it would mark the first easing of an Israeli naval blockade imposed on Gaza in 2007 after militant Hamas Islamists seized control of the Palestinian enclave.\nIsrael has described the corridor as a means of ending its civilian ties to Gaza, where it has been waging an 12-week-old offensive in retaliation for a cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by Hamas gunmen.\nWith hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians displaced, the idea may also go some way toward meeting a U.N. Security Council resolution of Dec. 22 calling for expanded humanitarian relief mechanisms.\n“It can start immediately,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM when asked about the Mediterranean corridor.\nHe said Britain, France, Greece and the Netherlands were among countries with vessels able to land directly on the shores of Gaza, which lacks a deep-water port. He appeared to suggest he expected them to do that rather than offload aid in Israel.\n“They requested of us that the equipment come via (the Israeli port of) Ashdod. The answer is no. It won’t come via Ashdod. It won’t come via Israel. We want disengagement, with security control. That’s the goal of this process,” Cohen said.\nThere was no immediate response from London, Paris, Athens or Amsterdam.\nBritain and Greece have previously expressed support for the Cypriot initiative, with Britain offering shallow-bottomed vessels to approach the Gaza coast, a senior Cypriot official told Reuters.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has also backed the Cypriot plan, which would involve Israeli security agents taking part in the Larnaca inspections.\n“As of now there is a maritime blockade, and if such an (aid) ship comes from Larnaca, it will be with our approval,” Cohen said. “It will of course be a secured corridor, as we have no intention of endangering a British or French ship coming in coordination with us.”\nSeveral European and Arab donor countries have been sending aid to Gaza through the nearby Egyptian coastal town of Al Arish. Israel has been involved in monitoring those shipments, in what some humanitarian relief agencies say creates lags.\nCairo tracks traffic across its Gaza border and has ruled out any influx of Palestinian refugees. On Saturday, Israel signalled it would seize control of the Gaza-Egypt border zone as part of its efforts to demilitarise the enclave.\n(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

    "text": "Onde ele entra, é para ganhar. No plano individual ou em termos coletivos, o segundo lugar continua a ser o primeiro dos últimos para Cristiano Ronaldo e essa vontade de ser melhor chegou agora a mundos fora dos relvados como os seguidores no Youtube, depois de ter alcançado 20 milhões em menos de 24 horas e tendo agora 55 milhões, ainda assim seis vezes menos do que o maior youtuber , o norte-americano MrBeast (313).\n9️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ golos para o melhor da história do futebol ⚽️ #sporttvportugal #FUTEBOLnaSPORTTV #LigadasNações #Portugal #Croácia #CristianoRonaldo pic.twitter.com/DSo6xrgDKI\n— sport tv (@sporttvportugal) September 5, 2024\n“MrBeast? É o gajo que tenho de bater”, atirou na conferência de imprensa desta segunda-feira, a primeira do início da preparação de Portugal para a estreia numa nova edição da Liga das Nações frente à Croácia. “Falando mais a sério, isto foi para me aproximar dos meus fãs. Acho que merecem. Uma das coisas que mais gostei no Europeu foi ter tanta gente ao lado da Seleção e ao meu lado. É a minha forma de mostrar-lhes o carinho que têm tido por fim. Foram fiéis a mim nestes meus últimos anos de carreira… Os próximos cinco anos. Estou a brincar… Dois, três… Por aí, não sei. A questão dos subscritores e dos recordes… Há que relativizar mas quero. Sinto que os fãs estão mais contentes, mais próximos. Quando assim é, é com muito agrado que faço este tipo de coisas. Daqui a dois anos, se puder bater o MrBeast… Vamos ver”, referiu.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nMeio a brincar, meio a sério, Ronaldo vai dizendo “verdades”. E também já tinha sido assim na primeira grande entrevista no seu canal UR Ronaldo, com o antigo internacional e companheiro inglês Rio Ferdinand.\n“Sinto-me bem, acho que continuo a ser bem parecido [risos]… Sinto que continuo a conseguir driblar, a rematar, a marcar golos, a saltar… No dia em que sentir que não estou a produzir nada, a dar nada, arrumo as minhas coisas e afasto-me mas neste momento ainda sinto que estou longe desse dia. Marquei 60 golos na última época mas as pessoas dizem ‘Ah mas nem cinco golos conseguiste marcar no Europeu’. E que tem? Qual é o problema? Já marquei 130. Sou o maior goleador da história do futebol. Mas vou levantar ainda mais a fasquia. Em breve, vou ter 900 golos. E depois disso vou chegar aos 1.000 golos. Quero chegar a essa marca. Que idade terei nessa altura? Talvez 41, não sei. Para mim, a melhor marca que posso ter neste momento é chegar aos 1.000 golos com uma diferença: existirão vídeos de todos”, referiu .\nMais golos, mais jogos, mais vitórias, mais de tudo: UEFA entrega “prémio especial” a Ronaldo, o senhor Champions\nAlém de elevar uma fasquia que esteve sempre alta, Ronaldo aproveitava a oportunidade para deixar uma “farpa” a todos os que apresentam outros números em relação à contabilidade de golos oficiais. Entretanto, fazia o seu caminho com mais uma temporada a começar como se o tempo não passasse por si: quatro jogos, quatro golos (um em cada), duas assistências e a frustração que ficou bem expressa na final do Al Nassr com o Al Hilal por perder de novo a Supertaça. Agora chegava à Seleção de novo na liderança da equipa nacional depois de um Europeu “cortado” nos quartos pela França, podendo reforçar o estatuto de melhor marcador de sempre em seleções com o 900.º golo da carreira. E não desperdiçou a oportunidade, assinando o segundo golo da vitória de Portugal contra a Croácia ainda na primeira parte.\nO 64.º livre direto, uma assistência, barreira dos 900 golos ao virar da esquina: Ronaldo em destaque na goleada do Al Nassr\nPela Seleção, o avançado de 39 anos conseguiu o 131.º golo em 213 compromissos oficiais que tiveram o seu início na fase final do Campeonato da Europa de 2024, organizado em Portugal. Por clubes, e sempre desde que subiu aos seniores na temporada de 2002/03 no Sporting, marcou cinco em 31 partidas pelos leões, 145 em 346 encontros pelo Manchester United nas duas passagens que teve por Old Trafford, 450 em apenas 438 jogos pelo Real, 101 em 134 partidas pela Juventus e 68 em 74 jogos pelo Al Nassr.",

    "text": "Instagram Bristol Palin just revealed she is suffering from facial paralysis on half of her face.\nThe former reality star took to Instagram Stories to share that symptoms started nine days ago.\nThe mother of three shared, “I woke up nine days ago with a weird little sensation in my face. My mouth was pulling this way and it just felt a little off. So, I went and looked in the mirror. I’m like, ‘Wow, this is looking a little weird.’”\nWithin hours the left side of her face “was numb and just paralyzed.”\nInstagram Bristol, the daughter of former Republican VP nominee Sarah Palin, explained, “Couldn’t really blink my eye, definitely had no movement on the side of my face. So crazy. [I] went to the doctor. They ran tests, they did a CT scan, [and] they put me on steroids, put me on other medications. Nothing came back with all the results. They think it’s just a case of Bell’s palsy maybe brought on by stress or lack of sleep.”\nWhile she couldn’t pin point anything she was “super stressed out about,” but added, “I think it was brought on by stress.”\nBristol told viewers, “I know I look crazy right now, but this has been such an improvement from what I was looking like.”\nShe added, “I’m finally starting to get some of the sensation back. It’s been, like, a little painful the last two days, which is a sign... good indication that it’s getting better, so praise the Lord.”\nInstagram The 34-year-old said the next time she thinks of criticizing her looks she will just be thankful for “a normal functioning face.”\nPalin also suggested Eastern medicine as well, saying, “I’ve been getting acupuncture multiple times, and that’s helped speed up the process of recovery tremendously.”\nShe went on to post some videos of herself over the past week as she struggled with the paralysis.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic , “Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close.”",

    "text": "Madrid: Atletico Madrid got the better of Real Madrid this time, beating its crosstown rival 4-2 in extra time Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey.\nAntoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme scored after a 2-2 draw in regulation to send Atletico to the last eight less than a week after it lost to Madrid in the semi-finals of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.\nAtletico thrived again at home, where it also beat Madrid in the first Spanish league derby of the season in September in what had been its rival’s only loss this season.\nAtletico is unbeaten in 25 consecutive matches at its Metropolitano stadium in all competitions, with two draws since a 1-0 league defeat to Barcelona in January 2023.\nDefending champion Madrid eliminated Atletico in the Copa quarterfinals last season, winning 3-1 in extra time at home. The city rivals will play again February 4 — the third meeting in less than a month — in La Liga at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Madrid won 5-3 in extra time in the Super Cup semi-finals last Wednesday.\nGriezmann secured Atletico’s win this time with a beautiful goal after making a run through the right side of the area. The France international, Atletico’s all-time top scorer with 175 goals, got past Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior before finding the top corner from a tight angle.\n“It was an amazing goal, probably one of his best,” Madrid coach Diego Simeone said. “We played a very good match and the players gave everything they had against a top opponent. It was a great match.”\nRiquelme sealed Atletico’s win from inside the area on a breakaway in the 119th after an assist by Memphis Depay.\nAtletico had opened the scoring with a goal from close range by Samuel Lino after Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger deflected the ball backwards into the area in the 39th.\nMadrid equalized after a rare mistake by Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who punched the ball into his net while trying to clear a cross.\nÁlvaro Morata put Atletico ahead again from close range in the 57th after Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin failed to fully clear a cross. The ball bounced off Rüdiger and went toward Morata in front of an open net.\nStriker Joselu, who came on for Rodrygo in the 80th, equalized with a header in the 82nd after a cross by Jude Bellingham. Morata had missed a clear chance in a one-on-one situation with Lunin just moments earlier.\nBrahim Díaz thought he had scored an equalizer late in extra time, but the goal was disallowed because of an offside by Bellingham.\nBellingham hit the crossbar early in the first half, and Rodrygo struck the woodwork in the second.\nMadrid went on to win the Spanish Super Cup 4-1 in the final against Barcelona Sunday, but there was no guard of honour by Atletico before the match at the Metropolitano.\nThere was a report by The Athletic and some Spanish media that some Atletico fans called Vinícius a monkey before the game. The Brazil international had been racially abused by Atletico fans before other derbies, including by some who hanged an effigy of the player off a highway bridge last year.\nSimeone exchanged a few heated words with Vinícius after the end of regulation. The coach appeared to be upset with Vinícius because of his celebration after Joselu’s goal. Vinícius also got into a spat with one of the ball boys at the Metropolitano.\n“It was a very competitive match, he was involved in many duels, and sometimes you are not able to keep your cool,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said about Vinícius. “I think it’s understandable.”\nAncelotti’s Madrid had come into the game on an unbeaten run of 21 matches in all competitions, with 17 wins and four draws.\nBARCELONA ADVANCES\nBarcelona picked up the pace in the second half to beat third-division club Unionistas 3-1 in its pre-quarterfinal match.\nIt will be the second straight last-eight appearance for the Catalan club, which arrived under pressure after losing the Spanish Super Cup final to Madrid.\nAfter being held 1-1 at half-time, Barcelona improved in the second half to secure the victory with goals by Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde.\nThe hosts had taken the lead with a beautiful one-timer by Álvaro Gómez in the 31st minute before Ferran Torres equalized for Barcelona on a breakaway in the 45th. Koundé scored with a long-range shot in the 69th and Balde sealed the victory with a strike from a tight angle in the 73rd.\n“After a tough loss in the Super Cup we needed to rebound,” Koundé said. “It wasn’t easy, they have a good team and were very motivated.”\nUnionistas had a few chances to move closer toward the end, but Barcelona goalkeeper Iñaki Peña made some good saves to maintain the comfortable lead at the 5,000-capacity Reina Sofia Stadium.\nBarcelona defender Pau Cubarsí, 16, made his first-team debut by entering the match after halftime to replace Andreas Christensen.\nUnionistas had eliminated Villarreal on penalties in the previous round.\n ",

    "text": "If you or a loved one have breast cancer, you are not alone. With support groups at local hospitals and the Susan G. Komen’s Share Your Story project, women can draw strength from one another (we’ve listed a number of tools and resources at the end of this article). One local breast cancer survivor, Carolyn Hersh, spoke to TBN about her journey. Hersh was 54 years old at diagnosis and never missed an annual mammogram since age 40. With no family history of breast cancer and genetic testing indicating she did not have the BRCA gene, she was surprised when she learned that she had triple negative breast cancer, Stage 2 (because of size of the tumor). “Luckily there was no lymph node involvement or worse, which would have made it Stage 3 or 4 respectively,” said Hersh. She was diagnosed Dec. 30, 2022 and because it was triple negative, she had 16 rounds of chemotherapy before surgery. “The first 4 rounds are fondly nicknamed ‘Red Devil’ because they are red in color, and so potent that you can only have 4 rounds of them in a lifetime,” she said. After the chemo rounds and concurrent immunotherapy injections, Hersh met with her Moffitt oncologist. “Because I responded so favorably to the treatment and my tumor had shrunk, I was able to choose a less invasive surgery,” she said. “Choosing the lumpectomy immediately required me to go through 15 radiation treatments, but I was able to forgo the invasive surgery.” Some bad news required other interventional treatments. Pathology results revealed Hersh still had live cancer cells in the tumor. She wound up taking nearly 900 doses of pills. “All in all, I had 16 chemo infusions through my port, 15 Keytruda immunotherapy infusions, three hospitalizations, two surgeries, 15 radiations, and the above-mentioned pills!” she said. “This was over an 18-month period.” Today, Hersh has been in “active observation,” formerly called remission, for about 4 months. “I don’t worry about it coming back per se, but I do have some residual side effects which stay at the forefront of my daily living,” she said. “I was hospitalized once for Neutropenia (a common side effect of chemotherapy because of what it does to your blood and immune system), once for the surgery, and a third time for a hematoma related to the lumpectomy.” She still does regular mammograms. “I grew up in a household where you get your teeth cleaned twice a year, and at appropriate ages, you get annual exams, so this was my life. Because TNBC is fast growing and aggressive, I can’t even imagine what my prognosis would have been if it hadn’t been found in a routine mammogram,” she said, recommending that women find a good physician and oncologist and trust their knowledge. Each woman’s journey is unique, says Hersh, and although it is terrifying, you are not alone. “The biggest thing I can say about mental health during this journey has been to stay off of any internet searches outside of those written by medical professionals,” she said. “This is a very scary time, and I learned very early that my journey is not like any other woman’s journey, and the internet can be a landfill of stories with negative outcomes. I’ve also turned to Pilates as a recovery tool and have found it to ease my mind and aches and pains.” Hersh’s encore chapter started August 1, when she retired from her 21-year career as an Allstate agent. “The cancer did have an impact on my decision,” she says. She will continue her work with Dogs, Inc. (formally Southeastern Guide Dogs) as a puppy raiser, the New Port Richey Rotary and plans to be a Moffitt volunteer. What You Need to Know Know your family history and consult your physician about your risk for breast cancer. Depending on your age and family history, your physician will remind you how frequently you should get a mammogram and how to do a monthly at-home examination. An excellent website to help women navigate breast cancer detection and treatment can be found at the Susan G. Komen website. SGK’s mission is to save lives by meeting the most critical needs in communities and investing in breakthrough research to prevent and cure breast cancer. Its real-women journeys provide a beacon of hope to those going through the cancer diagnosis and treatment journey.
