    "text": "[Amazon](https://www.techtimes.com/tags/amazon) is reassuring its shareholders in its annual shareholder letter, especially in the tech giant's place in the ongoing [artificial intelligence](https://www.techtimes.com/tags/artificial-intelligence) race. Although the market and consumers generally believe that Amazon is lagging in AI, Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO, expressed optimism in an annual shareholder letter released on Thursday. Jassy believes a large portion of this game-changing AI will be built on top of Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing division, which is already the backbone of many of the world's digital businesses. In the letter, Jassy outlined the company's [generative AI](https://www.techtimes.com/tags/generative-ai) strategy. He also said that the company is more interested in developing the underlying \"foundational\" AI models and selling them to enterprise clients, which currently include Siemens, Pfizer, and Delta Air Lines, than in creating consumer-facing applications to directly compete with well-known tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (Photo by PAU BARRENA/AFP via Getty Images) The logo of Amazon Web Services AWS is seen on the opening day of the Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) audiovisual and systems integration exhibition in Barcelona on January 31, 2023. According to Amazon's CEO, the business [approaches](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-comments-annual-shareholder-letter-2024-4) its AI initiatives in three layers: developing core models, employing pre-built gen AI apps, and leveraging existing ones, depending on their requirements and experience level. According to Jassy, the company's five guiding principles are hiring builders who push boundaries, concentrating on customer challenges, and developing foundational tools to drive innovation, which he claims to be the key to its continued success and resilience. It also entails accepting improved technology from whatever source and learning from mistakes. Amazon's CEO also stated that the business evaluates cost-cutting measures while expediting customer goods delivery.

After spending billions of dollars, companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic AI have created AI bots that are getting better and better. However, businesses are finding it difficult to incorporate them into their current offerings, and as of right now, most customers have not started paying actual money for the AI tools that are already on the market. Regarding generative AI, Amazon has invested billions of dollars. It added $2.75 billion to its $4 billion initial investment in start-up Anthropic, granting it a minority position. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services, and Amazon will be able to provide its business clients with access to Anthropic's Claude, one of the top generative AI models. Amazon's AI Efforts Recently, Amazon Web Services has also increased the number of free credits available to startups to [offset the expenses of utilizing large AI models](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/303164/20240402/amazon-expands-free-credits-program-startups-using-ai-models-offers-anthropic.htm). This growth is a component of AWS's plan to increase Bedrock, its AI platform,'s market share. Using their cloud credits, startups can now obtain models from various suppliers, such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere. Wright emphasized that Anthropic's revenue would increase due to Amazon's free credits, demonstrating the company's dedication to fostering ecosystem development. AWS has committed to assisting new companies by providing over $6 billion in credits to startups over the last ten years.

The Rise of Online Dating Burnout Remember the initial excitement of swiping right? The thrill of a new match? For many, that spark has fizzled, replaced by a gnawing sense of fatigue and frustration. Welcome to the age of online dating burnout.\ndating apps, once hailed as revolutionary tools for finding love, are increasingly being recognized as potential sources of stress and emotional exhaustion . A recent survey highlights this growing concern, revealing that a significant portion of online daters experience burnout [1] .\nThe Dark Side of Digital Romance: Understanding Online Dating burnout What exactly *is* online dating burnout? It’s that feeling of being emotionally drained by the endless cycle of swiping, matching, and engaging in frequently enough unfulfilling conversations [2] . It’s the disappointment of ghosting, the sting of rejection, and the feeling that you’re just another profile in a sea of faces.\nThink of it like this: you’re constantly “on,” presenting the best version of yourself, hoping to catch someone’s eye. it’s a performance, and performances are exhausting.\nQuick Fact: A Forsa survey found that 59% of online daters between 18 and 60 experienced emotional exhaustion and frustration as an inevitable result of their online partner search. Why Are We Burning Out? The Root Causes of Dating App Fatigue Several factors contribute to the rise of online dating burnout. Let’s break them down:\nThe Paradox of Choice: Too Many Options, Too Little Time Dating apps offer an overwhelming number of potential partners. This abundance can lead to “ choice paralysis ,” where you spend so much time swiping that you never actually connect with anyone. It’s like being in a grocery store with a thousand different cereals – you end up staring blankly at the shelves, unable to make a decision.\nThe Ghosting Epidemic: Vanishing acts and Emotional Fallout Ghosting – the abrupt cessation of dialog without explanation – is rampant in the online dating world. This can be incredibly hurtful and damaging to self-esteem. Imagine investing time and energy into getting to know someone, only to have them disappear without a trace. It’s like a punch to the gut.\nSuperficiality Reigns: Judging Books by Their Covers (and Selfies) Many dating apps prioritize appearance over substance. Profiles often consist of carefully curated photos and brief bios, encouraging users to make snap judgments based on superficial criteria. This can lead to a feeling of being objectified and a sense that genuine connection is secondary.\nUnrealistic Expectations: The Quest for Perfection The curated nature of online profiles can create unrealistic expectations. People often present idealized versions of themselves,leading to disappointment when you meet them in person and discover they’re not quite the person you imagined. It’s like ordering a gourmet meal online and receiving a TV dinner.\nThe Time Suck: Endless Swiping and Unrewarding Conversations Online dating can be a major time commitment. Hours can be spent swiping, messaging, and going on dates that ultimately lead nowhere.This can feel like a huge waste of time and energy, contributing to feelings of frustration and burnout.\nExpert Tip: Psychologist Isabelle Wenck suggests that if you’re feeling mentally stressed by online dating, reduce your time on the apps or take a break altogether. The Future of Dating: Navigating the Digital Landscape Without Burning Out So, what does the future hold for online dating? Will we all eventually succumb to burnout and retreat to real-world encounters? Not necessarily. The key is to adapt and evolve our approach to digital romance .\nThe Rise of “Slow Dating”: Quality Over Quantity one emerging trend is “ slow dating ,” which emphasizes quality over quantity. Instead of swiping through hundreds of profiles, slow daters focus on connecting with a smaller number of people on a deeper level. This involves taking the time to read profiles carefully, engaging in thoughtful conversations, and prioritizing genuine connection over superficial attraction.\nAI-Powered Matchmaking: Beyond the Algorithm Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to play a significant role in the future of online dating. AI-powered matchmaking systems can analyze user data to identify compatible partners based on personality traits, values, and interests, rather than just appearance and demographics. This could lead to more meaningful connections and reduce the frustration of sifting through endless incompatible profiles.\nImagine an app that not only considers your stated preferences but also analyzes your communication style, your social media activity, and even your facial expressions to predict compatibility.That’s the power of AI.\nVirtual Reality Dating: Immersive experiences and Authentic Connection Virtual reality (VR) technology could revolutionize the way we date online. VR dating platforms could allow users to meet in immersive virtual environments, engaging in shared activities and experiences that foster genuine connection. Imagine going on a virtual hike, attending a virtual concert, or even cooking a virtual meal together.thes shared experiences could help break down barriers and create a more authentic sense of connection.\nThe Hybrid Approach: Blending Online and Offline Worlds The future of dating may involve a hybrid approach that combines the convenience of online platforms with the authenticity of real-world interactions. Dating apps could facilitate connections,but the emphasis would be on quickly transitioning to offline dates and activities. This would allow users to assess compatibility in person and avoid the pitfalls of prolonged online communication.\nThink of it as using dating apps as a tool for finding, not as a substitute for real-life interaction.\nDating App Detox: Reclaiming Your Time and Energy Sometimes, the best solution is to simply take a break from dating apps altogether. A “dating app detox” can help you reclaim your time and energy, allowing you to focus\nIs Online Dating Burning You Out? An Expert’s Guide to finding Love in the Digital Age Time.news sits down with Dr. Vivian Holloway, a relationship psychologist, to discuss the rising phenomenon of online dating burnout and how to navigate the digital dating world more effectively.\nTime.news: Dr. Holloway, thank you for joining us. Online dating has become so prevalent, yet we’re hearing more and more about “dating app burnout.” What exactly is that?\nDr. Holloway: It’s a pleasure to be here. Online dating burnout is the emotional exhaustion that comes from the repetitive cycle of swiping, matching, and often having unfulfilling conversations. It’s that feeling of being mentally drained by the process, coupled with the disappointments of ghosting and the sting of rejection. It’s almost like you’re always performing and that takes a toll.\nTime.news: A recent survey found that a meaningful percentage of online daters experience this. What are the main factors contributing to this burnout?\nDr. Holloway: There are several key drivers. First, the paradox of choice .Dating apps present us with an overwhelming number of potential partners, leading to “choice paralysis” – we spend so much time swiping, we don’t actually connect. Then there’s the ghosting epidemic . The sudden disappearance of someone you’re talking to can be incredibly hurtful. The superficiality of many apps, prioritizing photos over substance, also plays a role and contributes to feeling objectified. Unrealistic expectations fueled by curated profiles lead to dissapointment. the time suck is undeniable. Hours spent swiping and messaging can feel like a waste if they don’t lead anywhere.\ntime.news: So, what can people do if they’re experiencing this burnout? Is there a way to use dating apps without becoming completely disillusioned?\nDr. Holloway: Absolutely. One crucial step is to reduce your time on the apps or take a complete break . I often advise patients to set limits, like only using the apps for 30 minutes a day, or taking a “dating app detox” for a week or two. This allows you to recharge and refocus. The Forbes Health Survey done in October 2024 indicates that the majority of Gen Z are experiencing dating app fatigue [3] , which indicates it is very common.\nTime.news: The online dating landscape is constantly evolving.What does the future hold? Are there any emerging trends that could help alleviate burnout?\nDr. Holloway: Yes, I see several promising trends. “Slow dating,” focusing on quality over quantity, is gaining traction. Instead of mindlessly swiping,people are investing time in reading profiles and having more thoughtful conversations [1] .This leads to more meaningful connections.Then there’s AI-powered matchmaking , which uses data to find compatible partners based on personality and values, not just looks.We might also see virtual reality (VR) dating becoming more popular. Imagine meeting someone in an immersive virtual environment and doing activities together – it could foster a more authentic connection.\nTime.news: A hybrid approach, blending online and offline interactions, sounds engaging.\nDr. Holloway: Exactly. Dating apps can be a tool to find potential partners, but the emphasis should be on quickly transitioning to real-life dates. It’s important to assess compatibility in person and avoid getting stuck in endless online interaction.\nTime.news: Any final words of advice for our readers who are feeling discouraged by online dating?\nDr. Holloway: Remember that you’re not alone.Online dating burnout is a common experience. Be mindful of your emotional well-being, set realistic expectations, and don’t be afraid to take a break. Approach online dating as one tool in your search for connection, not the only one. And always prioritize your mental health. There are also 5 ways that are suggested by Forbes to recover from dating burnout [1] .",

    "title": "Joe Burrow reveals top thing Tom Brady helped him with this offseason",
    "text": "Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow says that Tom Brady helped him in a key area before the 2024 season. Burrow, during an appearance on the \"Rich Eisen Show,\" revealed that he uses every chance he can to pick the brains of legends like Brady and Peyton Manning. \"I've talked to Tom several times this offseason,\" Burrow said. \"He's a good resource for me. Peyton, I've known Peyton since after my first year at LSU, you know he's helped me a lot along the road. And so whenever I get a chance to pick those guy's brains about how they operated, what their process was, how they thought about certain things, maybe it's not even football, maybe it's off the field, how they handle certain things, that's always an opportunity that I'm going to take advantage of.\" But the one thing Burrow singled out as the most important from Brady was \"how to handle off-the-field situations\" away from the team in a way that sets him up for success. Burrow wouldn't dive deeper when prompted, beyond hints it pertains to real-world items like friends, relationships, etc. For Bengals fans, it has to be nice to hear that Burrow has access to one of the best possible resources when it comes to dealing with all that comes with being a top NFL passer.

Lonzo Byrant Powers, 55, faces a charge of willful injury-causing serious injury, a Class C felony. Iowa City police were called to the area of Washington and Clinton streets at 9:10 p.m. Wednesday for a report of a fight that ended in a stabbing. Officers found the victim, who had been stabbed multiple times and was taken to a hospital, according to a news release from the Iowa City Police Department and a criminal complaint. The victim was not identified in the complaint or the release. Powers was arrested in relation to the stabbing. He was booked into the Johnson County Jail just after 1 a.m. Thursday. He had an initial appearance in court Thursday and was being held on a $10,000 bail.

Their only goal is to pretend to be people to \"drive engagement\". It's basically fraud.\"\nThey also wish to have no liability/accountability/responsibility over whatever junk those bots spew out.\nThey just say \"FREE SPEECH!\"\nSocial Control Media is basically a dying business. [ Ask Microsoft how LinkedIn is doing](/n/2025/01/08/Microsoft_LinkedIn_Going_the_Way_of_the_Epstein.shtml)...\nNobody is spared. It's safe to assume that YouTube still loses lots of money, as does TikTok (the Chinese government can subsidise those losses; it stands to gain from the censorship, propaganda, and other harms).\nIs it just Social Control Media?\nIs it bigger and broader a trend?\nWhat is the Web as a whole becoming if not a giant cesspool of chaff and LLM slop, regurgitated by \"bullshit generators\" (as RMS calls them)?\nIt that's not bad enough, someone has just told us that [Linux Foundation](/wiki/Linux_Foundation) is ending the last vestiges of Firefox. It does seem so, plus the obligatory openwashing of Chrom*. Those \"alternatives\" merely help Chrome, which is proprietary, become synonymous with \"the Web\". Several years ago the Linux Foundation took a [Mozilla](/wiki/Mozilla/) project under its armpit (Servo) and did almost nothing with it for several years.\nThe future of the Web does not look good. HTTP/S is fast becoming little but as a transport layer for this proprietary thing (with DRM) called \"Chrome\" - a platform for 'webapps' (JavaScript, WASM, and more). It's the \"new Flash\".

    "title": "What David Moyes did to Declan Rice at full-time of Arsenal's crushing West Ham defeat - football.london",
    "text": "[Arsenal](https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/) endured a tough evening on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. The north Londoners had the chance to go to the top of the Premier League table if they were able to secure all three points. But Tomas Soucek broke the deadlock early on before Konstantinos Mavropanos doubled his side's lead in the second half. Mikel Arteta's side were unable to find an answer, losing their first match at home this season. After the full-time whistle, Gunners midfielder Declan Rice was spotted embracing Hammers boss David Moyes, with the two sharing a few words as they hugged. Of course, Rice was managed by Moyes during his time with West Ham, signing for Arsenal in the most recent summer transfer window, joining for a club-record £105million. The result means that the Gunners are still two points behind league leaders Liverpool, who beat Burnley 2-0 earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Aston Villa are just three points off the top whilst fourth-placed Manchester City are five behind the Reds, also having a game in hand on their title rivals.
