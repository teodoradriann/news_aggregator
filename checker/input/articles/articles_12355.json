    "text": "CNN reporter Tom Foreman fact-checked many of the claims made by former President Donald Trump regarding the economy and immigration.\nTrump spoke to reporters at a press conference on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago , where the Republican nominee slammed Kamala Harris’s intelligence, and popularity. Trump also claimed the U.S. economy was headed toward a depression.\nThe former president also claimed that Biden was forced out of the presidency by his fellow Democrats.\nForeman joined a CNN panel following the event to ‘unpack’ many of the false claims made by Trump.\nThere is a lot to unpack in terms of falsehoods. Let’s start with the economy, a big thing for many issues out there. He said we could literally be in the throes of a depression, not a recession. He said close to 1920s depression, 1920s the depression was 25% unemployment. We’re at 4.3% now. Not even close, not even the same ballgame. He also mentioned, weirdly enough, people can’t buy bacon. I checked on bacon sales. They seem to be doing just fine. On the border, as Brianna noted earlier, he grossly overinflated the number of people coming over the border there. He also repeated a claim that he’s made many times before that he really must like, even as the numbers fall here, saying this notion that people are coming out of mental institutions and prisons, as he said, all over the world, are emptying into the United States, he said this many times, never offered any proof about Kamala Harris.\nHe says she’s the most unpopular, worst vice president in history. Couldn’t pass her bar exam. Scholars surveyed by the L.A. Times , ranked VP’s from 1933 on. They put Harris at 11 out of 18. Not great. Certainly not the worst. And she did pass her bar exam, even though she had to do it more than once. He said President Biden had the presidency taken away from him. Not true. That is false. President Biden agreed to leave the presidency. He wasn’t happy about it. Nobody would be. But he agreed to leave. And he backs Harris and her campaign.\nHe said everybody wanted Roe v Wade overturned. The country overwhelmingly wanted this and returned to the States. Not true. Even now, more than two years afterward, a Pew study said that 63% of people still think abortion nationwide should largely be legal, not left up to the states. And one more thing. He talked for quite some time there about how he protected Hillary Clinton and always wanted to keep her safe, but at least more than a half dozen times in recent years, he has said publicly she should go to jail and a whole lot of other Democrats as well.\nWatch the clip above via CNN .\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

    "text": "This AI tool could help cities improve accessibility at intersections Researchers at Utah State University are developing an AI tool to identify accessibility issues at intersections, which could make it easier for cities to find and fix those issues. There are many features intersections use for convenience and accessibility — walk signs with visual and verbal cues, curb ramps with textured bumps, and clearly marked crosswalks, to name a few. Sometimes, however, these features may be insufficient, broken, or completely absent, making it harder for especially those with disabilities to get around. “In some cities, they have a barrier in the middle of the road that a person in a wheelchair can’t get over,” said Mary Ellen Heiner, the senior coordinator of projects at USU’s [Institute for Disability, Research, Policy & Practice](https://idrpp.usu.edu/) (IDRPP). “Or even a person who’s blind, they come to that island and they can’t get on ... they don’t know where a ramp is on it, if there is one.” What causes lack of accessibility This lack of accessibility features is caused by a number of factors. Not all engineers or city planners are trained in accessibility, and even when they do know what standards to reach for, making things accessible can be more time-consuming and expensive. “A lot of times, I think we’re always trying to save money at the expense of accessibility,” said Matthew Wappett, executive director at IDRPP. A lot of infrastructure in the U.S. was also built before accessibility standards were set with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. “So we have this aging infrastructure that’s just not up to date with current standards,” Wappett said. Heiner also noted that even when things are compliant with the ADA, they may not be truly accessible because of how much the world has changed in the last 34 years. “They don’t take into consideration that buildings change, that mobility equipment has changed, that IT equipment has changed,” Heiner said. “Buildings say that they’re accessible because they follow the ADA, but they’re not given current technology that we have.” How this project helps To help with that problem, Chamberlain and his team have been [developing an AI tool](https://www.usu.edu/today/story/usu-researchers-develop-ai-tool-to-identify-accessibility-issues-at-intersections/?nl=981) for the past nearly two years that can recognize accessibility issues at intersections. Researchers train the AI by giving it thousands and thousands of images they’ve labeled with important objects, like stop signs or sidewalks. The more images they give, the more the machine can correctly identify those objects — and when they’re absent or out of place. “So far, based on their evaluation, we think our system is able to detect roughly like 87% accuracy,” said Xiaojun Qi, another investigator on the project and a professor with USU’s Department of Computer Science. The researchers have to manually label every image and then double-check the accuracy of all the data, as some mistakes can carry on into future prediction results, which takes a lot of time — they've been doing this training since early 2023. However, that front-ended work makes analyzing the accessibility of intersections much faster. Joel Pierson, a computer science undergraduate at USU who’s working on this project, explained that they can run the AI model on every intersection of Logan in less than three minutes. The report that generates is color-coded based on how accessible different intersections are, which Qi says pedestrians, especially those with disabilities, could use to find the best route for getting around town. Working with cities on accessibility The tool isn’t only useful for individuals, however. Brent Chamberlain, the project’s principal investigator, said they can use it to help cities fill in gaps of data on accessibility. “Most communities don’t really have good data on the different components of mobility infrastructure,” said Brent Chamberlain, principal investigator with the project and an associate professor at Utah State University. “We really need to know where these issues are so that we can plan ahead to fix them.” That may be all they do with some cities, but Chamberlain hopes that they can build longer-term partnerships that get into transitional planning as well. “This is like, how do we do from where we’re at now to being ADA compliant,” Chamberlain said. “And ideally, it’s not just about compliance ... it’s about inclusivity for broader populations.” ‘Broader populations’ isn’t just those with disabilities, either — a wide variety of pedestrians benefit from accessibility features, such as older people, parents with strollers, those on bikes or scooters, or even just people who walk slower. “A lot of times, these accessibility accommodations benefit a much broader swath of the population than people consider,” Wappett said.",

    "text": "Thursday started off brutally cold in Chicago, with wind chills dipping below zero, but what exactly does that mean and how is it calculated? A wind chill is the \"measure of how cold the air feels on your skin,\" NBC 5 Storm Team Meteorologist Kevin Jeanes said. \"How cold it is, plus how strong the winds are,\" Jeanes said. So how do you determine just how cold it feels? The equation isn't quite as simple. How to calculate wind chills According to the National Weather Service , \"wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by wind and cold.\" \"As the wind increases, it draws heat from the body, driving down skin temperature and eventually the internal body temperature. Therefore, the wind makes it FEEL much colder,\" the NWS reports. \"If the temperature is 0°F and the wind is blowing at 15 mph, the wind chill is -19°F. At this wind chill temperature, exposed skin can freeze in 30 minutes.\" Local The formula used to calculate wind chill is: 35.74 + 0.6215T – 35.75 (V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16) = Wind chill Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly[> Chicago Catch-Up newsletter]. In this equation, the “T” variable represents the air temperature, while the “V” variable represents the wind speed. The formula also accounts for heat transfer theory and skin tissue resistance, according to the NWS. For example, an air temperature of 10 degrees, and a wind speed of 25 miles per hour will create a wind chill of approximately minus-11 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Our bodies naturally give off heat,\" Jeanes explained. \"The air just around our body warms up, but when when the wind picks up, that removes the heat. So our body heat that it naturally gives off isn't warming us anymore. It isn't keeping us insulated.\" According to officials, the formula takes into account a measurement of the wind speed as measured at the average height of a human face, which is five feet. It also takes into account that a typical anemometer, a device used to measure wind speed, is placed 33 feet in the air. In order for wind chill to be calculated, the air temperature must be at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the NWS said. Finally, the formula assumes that measurements are taken at night, with no sunlight influencing the “feels-like” temperature.",

    "title": "Musk bedauert öffentlichen Streit mit Trump - Details zu Telefonat",
    "text": "Musk bedauert öffentlichen Streit mit Trump – Milliardäre telefonierten offenbar schon Anfang der Woche\nElon Musk hat im Streit mit Donald Trump einen Rückzieher hingelegt. Die ehemaligen Freunde sollen ein klärendes Telefonat geführt haben.\nUpdate, 12. Juni, 08.44 Uhr: Elon Musk bedauerte in einem Beitrag auf seiner Social-Media-Plattform X seinen öffentlichen Streit mit US-Präsident Donald Trump. Musk schrieb am Mittwoch: „Ich bedauere einige meiner Beiträge über Präsident @realDonaldTrump letzte Woche. Sie gingen zu weit.“ Nun wurde bekannt, dass der Tech-Milliardär zuvor wohl bereits am Montag mit Trump telefoniert hatte, wie mehrere US-Medien übereinstimmend berichten. Außerdem soll Musk vor seinem Telefonat mit dem US-Präsidenten mit Stabschefin Susie Wiles und Vizepräsident JD Vance gesprochen haben.\nErstmeldung: Washington, D.C. – US-Präsident\nDonald Trump soll in Paranoia verfallen sein. Das hat der Bestseller-Biograf von Trump, Michael Wolff, im Podcast von The Daily Beast behauptet. Der Grund: Trump bewerte seinen Vizepräsidenten JD Vance als existenzielle Bedrohung, nachdem Tesla-Ceo Elon Musk Vance im Zuge eines öffentlichen Streits mit Trump als dessen Nachfolger gefordert hatte.\nWolffs Vermutung:\nMusks Forderung versetzte Trump in Angst und Schrecken. Er misstraue seinem Vize Vance nun noch mehr. Trump habe sich einst für Vance als Vizepräsidenten entschieden, weil Musk die Personalie zur Bedingung gemacht haben soll, dass er Trump mit seinen Millionen im Wahlkampf unterstützt.\nMusk säte Misstrauen gegen Vance: Trump werde Loyalität seines Vize testen\nDer Autor vermutet, dass Trump seinen Vizepräsidenten künftig stärker unter die Lupe nehmen wird. „Er wird eine Reihe von Tests aufstellen, die Vance aushalten und bestehen muss“, mutmaßte Wolff im Podcast. Vance müsse „sich zu seiner absoluten Loyalität gegenüber Trump bekennen, oder er wird innerhalb der Verwaltung an den Rand gedrängt werden.“\nWährend des Streits mit Musk hatte sich Vance jedenfalls hinter Trump gestellt. „Ich bin der Vizepräsident von Präsident Trump. Meine Loyalität wird immer dem Präsidenten gelten“, hatte er betont. Musks Angriff auf Trump bezeichnete er als „großen Fehler“.\nHegt Trump Misstrauen gegen Vance nach Streit mit Musk?\nIn einer Erklärung gegenüber The Daily Beast bezeichnete der Kommunikationsdirektor des Weißen Hauses, Steven Chung, Wolff als „einen Vollidioten, der aufgrund seiner eklatanten Lügen und Erfindungen weithin diskreditiert ist“. Chung sagte weiter über Wolff: „Er ist ein Schwachkopf höchsten Grades, und sein\nvom Trump-Derangement-Syndrom verwirrtes Gehirn hat ihn dazu gebracht, ein erbärmliches Leben ohne Realität zu führen.“\nLaut Chung will Wolff nur relevant bleiben und Aufmerksamkeit erhalten: „Nichts von dem, was er sagt, ist die Wahrheit, und er greift auf haarsträubende Unwahrheiten zurück, um relevant zu bleiben, denn Vater Zeit hat ihn schon vor 20 Jahren überholt.“ (Jan-Frederik Wendt)",

In this sense, Brazil, which already supplies fertile eggs, now presents itself as a reliable partner for the supply of 1-day-old chicks,\" said Ricardo Santin, president of ABPA. \"It is worth highlighting that it is another important achievement for Minister Carlos Fávaro and his team for Brazil.\"\n“The expectation is that Mexico, which is already the largest importer of Brazilian fertile eggs, will also establish itself among the highlights in the 1-day-old chick segment,\" said Luís Rua, ABPA’s markets director. \"It’s another seal of approval for Brazil’s biosecurity.\"\nMore News\n[](/latest?section=news) [View all](/latest?section=news)",
