    "title": "Australia and Greece sign landmark space agreement",
    "text": "A landmark agreement has been signed between Australia and Greece, as both countries look to enhance their work in the field of space. Both nations are new to space technology but are hoping to work together to go further faster and help solve challenges common to both countries. The initial key focus for the companies involved, SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre and the Hellenic Space Centre (HSC), is developing microsatellites that can help with agriculture, environment, infrastructure, tourism and defence. The joint research aims to share scientific and technical information, and explore synergies between the Kanyini Mission and HSC’s National Microsatellite Program using data and AI. The agreement also encourages the exchange of experts and other collaborative activities to advance space technology and research. The initial key areas are microsatellites, earth observation, space science and academic collaborations, and commercial networking. Neos Kosmos spoke to the CEO of SmartSat, Professor Andy Koronios about the new venture. Microsatellites “Most countries now are looking to use space for a number of reasons, first of all, to build the industry and the technology, and Australia has invested heavily in this,” Koronios said. “The whole world is investing heavily in more space assets and it’s becoming cheaper to be able to actually put satellites in space. “In the past it was very, very expensive, it would be costing as much as half a billion dollars to actually put one satellite. Now you can put many satellites with very good capabilities as good as some of the big ones in fact because the technology is just changing so fast.” In the past Australia and Greece haven’t had the opportunity to put satellites up, they do now. Australia didn’t have a space agency until 2018. “I think we were the third country in the world to launch its own computer, but that was back in the 50s and then we went to sleep,” Koronios said. Back then a satellite had to be the size of a small bus, now they can be the size of a microwave or toaster. He shared that the resolution on these satellites, the ability to actually see on the ground is very high now, even going down to 30cm. “In other words, you can see someone in the backyard having a BBQ even with smaller satellites, not the big satellites that the US, Russia and China might have had in the past. ” Earth observation and environment These satellites can be used for agricultural applications, for environmental applications and for defence. Australia and Greece are pushing hard in this area, especially with the issues of bushfires and wildfires both countries face. “When we talk about looking after climate change and measuring what is happening to the environment, more than 50 per cent of all of the markers for identifying environmental impact cannot be done without space or satellites,” Koronios said. “We were funded about $250 million at SmartSet and in the last five years we’ve been developing some really world leading technologies in communications, in Earth observation. “Actually being able to detect smoke for bush fires very quickly, rather than having to wait until the fire is out of control.” There is also an opportunity for Australia to help neighbouring countries. Koronios said he has recently signed an agreement with New Zealand so they can work together to do some maritime monitoring of illegal fishing, people smuggling, drug smuggling in the South Pacific with Fiji and Tonga and all of the island nations there. Greece also has a lot of need for monitoring its coastlines of course, outside the defence reasons, there’s also a lot of migrant migration, a lot of people smuggling, refugees, so Koronios said being able to actually monitor that from space, they are very keen. According to a media release sent to Neos Kosmos, President of the HSC, Dr Ioannis Daglis said that they plan to build and launch seven microsatellites by 2026 and to deploy 15 satellites total. Despite having signed a lot of agreements over the years, with the likes of NASA and the European Space Agency, Koronios said this one is the most special for him, because it’s Greece. [He came to Australia from Greece](https://neoskosmos.com/en/2019/05/23/life/education/a-greek-to-lead-australias-space-agency/) at 17 and also served in the Australian Air Force. “I have a special relationship with both countries. I was born in Greece and was adopted by Australia. For this reason I am committed to the success of this partnership.”",

    "title": "Hoori or Whore? How Islam’s ‘72 Virgins’ Inspire Muslims to Suicidal Violence – PJ Media",
    "text": "A recent report highlights what must surely appear as “fake news” to Western sensibilities: the fact that “marrying” supernatural women in Islamic paradise — the notorious hooris — actuates young Muslim men in general, Palestinian suicide bombers (“martyrs”) in particular. The examples offered by the report are many. In one video, the mother of dead terrorist Abd al-Jabbar al-Sabbagh shared their final moments: He said to me: ‘Mom, this is the last week you’ll see me. That’s it, bid me farewell.’ I said: ‘Sweetie, why?’ He said: ‘That’s it, I feel I won’t remain much longer.’ I’m satisfied, I’m going to the Dark-Eyed Maidens [Hoor al-‘Ayn in the original Arabic] in Paradise, I want Martyrdom.’ I said: ‘Allah will be satisfied with you.’ Martyrdom is beautiful, not everyone who seeks it merits it, but the farewell is difficult. In another video discussing her “martyred” nephew, Intisar Nafea said of Ashraf Nafea: Praise Allah, [teen Martyr] Ashraf [Nafea] raises our heads up high. On Aug. 1, [2024,] he was supposed to turn 18 years old. I wanted to do a birthday for him. He said: ‘Get me married.’ I said: ‘[You will have] 72 [Virgins] like your uncle.’ He said: ‘Right. I don’t want to marry women from this world, I want to marry [women] from the world to come.’ The brother of terrorist Uday Al-Zayyat said: I told him: ‘Go on and get married’ … He told me: ‘Actually I want the Dark-Eyed Maidens of Paradise.’ Praise Allah, Allah granted him Paradise, Allah willing he will see the Dark-Eyed Maidens of Paradise. The wives of other “martyrs” posted things like, “All of you make sounds of joy for him. Don’t cry, he’s a groom and let everyone accompany him to his wedding.” So who are these “dark-eyed virgins” who “ yearn ” — as another Palestinian once phrased it — for martyrs, for those Muslims who, in the Koran’s words, “slay and are slain” (9:111)? The proper Arabic term for these entities is hoor al-‘ayn, commonly known by the English transliteration hoori (also “houri”). They are supernatural, celestial women — “wide-eyed” and “big-bosomed,” says the Koran (56:22, 78:33) — created by Allah for the express purpose of sexually gratifying his favorites in perpetuity. One of the canonical hadiths — a statement attributed to Muhammad that mainstream Islam acknowledges as true — has Muhammad saying, The martyr [shahid, one who dies fighting for Islam] is special to Allah. He is forgiven from the first drop of blood [that he sheds]. He sees his throne in paradise…. And he will copulate with seventy-two hooris. (See also Koran 44:54, 52:20, 55:72, and 56:22.) While the hooris may invoke images of scantily-clad genies and/or other wild tales from the Arabian Nights to the Western mind — and thus be dismissed as “fairy tales” with no capacity to inspire anyone — the fact is, desire for these immortal concubines has driven Muslim men to acts of suicidal terror, past and present, as recorded in both Muslim and Western historical sources. “As for religious enthusiasm and ardour for the holy war,” writes historian Marius Canard, “it is certain that numerous Muslims were moved by this sentiment… There are numerous accounts [in Arabic sources] describing combatants going to their deaths with joyful heart, seeing visions of the celestial hoori who is calling to them and signaling to them.” Indeed, the hooris are depicted as being ever present on the fields of jihad, beckoning their would-be lovers to rush to their embraces by engaging in wild acts of “martyrdom.” This is evident from the West’s first major military encounter with Islam, the fateful Battle of Yarmuk (636). There, one Muslim came upon a fallen comrade “smitten on the ground, and I watched as he lifted his fingers to the sky. I understood he was rejoicing, for he saw the hooris.” Another Arab chieftain told his men that a headlong charge against the “Christian dogs” is synonymous with a “rush to the embraces of the hooris!” “The Muslim preachers did not cease to encourage the combatants [at Yarmuk]: Prepare yourselves for the encounter with the hooris of the big black eyes!” explains a medieval Persian historian. “And to be sure, never has a day been seen when more heads fell than on the day of the Yarmuk.” Nearly a millennium later, on the night before the sack of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Turks also invoked the hooris to kindle the men’s fighting spirit. Wandering “dervishes visited the tents, to instill the desire of martyrdom, and the assurance of spending an immortal youth amidst the rivers and gardens of paradise, and in the embraces of the black-eyed virgins [hooris].” At the pivotal battle of Mohacs in 1526, seventy thousand Muslim invaders—described as devotees of “jihad and martyrdom,” eager for “a perpetually happy life” with “the hooris”—defeated the hitherto mighty kingdom of Hungary, built a massive pyramid of heads, and returned to Constantinople with one hundred thousand slaves. From the start, Western observers have corroborated the mesmerizing effects of the hoori’s siren call. Marco Polo (d.1324) explained why after assassinating their target, the hashashin (whence the English word “ assassin ”) would not flee but wait to be hacked down by their victim’s guards or men: They were eager to enter “paradise, where every species of sensual gratification should be found, in the society of beautiful nymphs [hooris].” In an eighth-century “interfaith dialogue” between Caliph Omar II and Eastern Roman Emperor Leo III, the latter wrote: “We [Christians] do not expect to enjoy there [heaven] commerce with women who remain forever virgin,” for “we put no faith in such silly tales engendered by extreme ignorance and by paganism.” But “for you who are given up to carnal vices, and who have never been known to limit the same, you who prefer your pleasures to any good, it is precisely for that reason that you consider the celestial realm of no account if it is not peopled with [supernatural] women.” If Muslims venerate and seek to emulate the world of early Islam, it should come as no surprise that these Sirens of Islam are still working their magic, above and beyond the opening anecdotes concerning Palestinian indoctrination. For instance, Naa’imur Rahman, a Muslim man from north London, who was “found guilty of plotting to blow up the gates of Downing Street and assassinate Theresa May… was motivated by the idea of being met by virgins in paradise after the attack, the court heard.” During discussions with an undercover officer, Rahman said that he was eager to “take her [May’s] head off, yeah”: I want to go to jannah [heaven] when I’m doing it. I don’t want to come back. I want them to kill me, but I just want to do my thing before I’m killed…. [I’ve been] thinking a lot about hur al ayn [hooris]… In sha allah [Allah willing] I meet them soon. Prior to the battle for Mosul in late 2016, the Islamic State’s “caliph,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said : All [who die fighting], without exception, will enter paradise as martyrs. Moreover, you will enter paradise with four more hooris than other martyrs. For just as you stand by me now, so will they stand by you—or under you, or above you—so that you might forget what will happen to you by way of violence, death, and degradation in this war. All this is a reminder that the Muslim mindset and the motivations behind it are many and multifaceted. Few in the West still seem to understand this and see it as, at best, an aberration. Thus a French reporter who once infiltrated and spent time with the Islamic State said, “I never saw any Islam. No will to improve the world,” only “suicidal” men looking forward to being “martyred” on, as they explained it to him, their “path to paradise,” where “women [hooris] are waiting for us.” Until such time that Western secular minds stop projecting their own materialistic paradigms onto Muslims in general, jihadists in particular, and start understanding Islam’s paradigms and motivations on their own terms, the West will continue to ignore the oldest and simplest advice concerning war: “know your enemy.”",

    "text": "Passengers on a round-the-world cruise have been left stranded in Belfast for the past three months with the passengers all on board as the ship undergoes lengthy repairs.\nVilla Vie Residences’ Odyssey was set to leave Belfast for the first leg of its three-year journey on May 30.\nHowever, the luxury ocean liner has been plagued by delays including issues with its rudders and the gearbox.\nThis has meant that passengers, some of whom have paid €810,000 for their lavish cabin, have instead found themselves spending their summer in Belfast rather than Bermuda.\nMany of the passengers who now call the city home are from across the world. They are allowed to spend time on the ship during the day but must leave during the evenings. Villa Vie Residences’ Odyssey. Many of the passengers who now call the city home are from across the world. They are allowed to spend time on the ship during the day but must leave during the evenings.\nThe company has paid for them to stay in hotels for the time being. Speaking to BBC News , Florida native Holly Hennessey said that she has adapted to the rainy Irish climate.\nShe said: ‘I’ve never had so much use for my umbrella in my life, and I carry my raincoat everywhere I go.’\nMs Hennessey, a self-described ‘cruise addict’, is travelling with her cat, Captain.\nHolly Hennessy. She said Villa Vie has offered passengers meals and onboard entertainment which is like the cruise experience – except you’re still in the dock.\nWhile Ms Hennessey has stayed put in Belfast, other passengers have used their peculiar predicament to their advantage and taken the opportunity to travel across Europe.\nSince May, Angela and Stephen Theriac have travelled by train across Spain , taken day trips to England and visited Greenland.\nMs Theriac said: ‘We are travellers, and we want to make the most of the place we are in.’\nStephen and Angela Theriac. The couple have even joked that they might apply for residency in Belfast.\nLanettte Canen and Johan Bodin have been documenting their life on the ocean liner on their social media page, called Living Life on a Cruise.\nThe pair claim their cabin on the Odyssey will be their home for the next 15-plus years as they gave a detailed video tour of the ship showcasing its amenities.\nDuring their time waiting to say bon voyage from Belfast, they have travelled to Croatia and Sweden for holidays.\nJohan Bodin and Lanettte Canen. Villa Vie Residences CEO Mike Petterson told the BBC that the Odyssey’s round-the-world cruise ship will launch by the end of next week.\nHe said: ‘When you’re the first at doing something, you will run into hiccups, but we’re definitely getting there, and although we are late, we will launch.’\n‘We’re not focused on the next days or weeks, we are focused on the rest of our lives and what this company will do for the residents and the industry.’\nHe said it is the first ‘affordable’ residential cruise ship.\nAmenities onboard include access to a swimming pool, a theatre and a gourmet restaurant.\nVilla Vie Residences’ Odyssey. Villa Vie Residences’ website states that the cost of buying a cabin can range from $99,999 (€90,000) to $899,000 (€810,000).\nDr David Austin, from Georgia in the US, told the BBC that he has ‘stopped counting down’ the days until the ship launches.\n‘The payoff of seeing the world in this fashion is too great to feel too disappointed with each delay announcement,’ he said.\n‘I was committed, having sold my house right before my arrival, and I’ve stayed committed to this adventure with every delay.’\nThe ship entered dry dock at H&W on arrival and had initially been due to set sail from Southampton on a round-the-world cruise on May 15, but the departure date and port were changed to May 30 from Belfast. However, she’s still in Belfast, three months after arrival.\nReportedly, new rudder stocks had to be manufactured, which contributed to the delay. The 1993-built ship was floated on July 24 and moved out of the dock to the repair quay on August 2.",

    "title": "‘So much death’: Lawmakers weigh stricter speed limits, safer roads for pedestrians",
    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.\nDespite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.\nOlivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.\nIn the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.\n“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”\nThe nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.\nStill, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.\nAlthough the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.\n“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.\nStill a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.\nExperts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .\nEarly estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.\nThe Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.\nRoad safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.\nBut the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.\nIn response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.\nAnd after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.\n“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.\nPush for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.\nRelated Articles National Politics | Election monitors nervously practice for the ‘big dance in November’ National Politics | Alito’s flag controversy foreshadows contentious Supreme Court rulings National Politics | Election certification disputes in a handful of states spark concerns over 2024 presidential contest National Politics | Election officials, retired lawmakers plead for more money to protect voting National Politics | Greater focus on crime sparks another wave of juvenile justice bills Automakers like BMW questioned the effectiveness of a program testing pedestrian protections in vehicles arguing that in European countries that adopted such a regulation, it’s not been clear whether it led to fewer deaths and injuries. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.\n“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.\nAlthough Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.\nWhen that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.\nIn Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.\nIt’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.\nStories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.\n“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.
