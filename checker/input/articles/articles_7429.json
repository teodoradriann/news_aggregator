    "text": "UCLA Football: DeShaun Foster Sets Tone For Bruins Even During Bye Week After near disaster in their season opener against the University of Hawaii, a bye week for the UCLA Bruins could be just what the doctor ordered as they prepare for a week three matchup against the Hoosiers of Indiana. For first-year head coach DeShaun Foster, having an extra week to clean up some of the miscues that plagued the Bruins in week one could be key as they venture through their first season in the Big Ten. The offensive performance was by far the most concerning area for the Bruins in their first game of the season as they turned the ball over twice and failed to establish any rhythm against the Rainbow Warriors in the first half. As Southern California is experiencing a September heat wave, coach Foster had his team on the full go as he looked to find improvements on both sides of the football. “It didn’t feel like a bye week practice at all.” … Foster on his focus in the bye week: “I want the whole team to get better, so it’s not a one-sided thing like one side of the ball needs to get better and the other side can stay where they’re at; everybody needs to improve.” The Bruins' defense was the highlight of their week one game, after holding the Hawaii offense to 13 points despite turnovers leading to unfavorable field positions. A bend but don't break mindset established by Ikaika Malloe is going to be a huge factor in how the Bruins will fair this season as they are going to be playing against offenses like Oregon, USC, and LSU. Ethan Garbers and the UCLA offense will have to find ways to score despite losing two offensive linemen. It was obvious that this side of the ball was still going through the growing pains of learning a new system under two-time Super Bowl champion offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy. There had been rumblings throughout camp that this offense was going to have some challenges learning a new scheme, but, no one expected that it was going to look so lethargic against an opponent like Hawaii. Simplifying the verbiage and play-calling could help remedy some of the mistakes that took place a week ago. Utilizing their playmakers like Rico Flore Jr. and their stable of running backs the UCLA Bruins are looking to bounce back big against Indiana in week 3.

    "text": "Uma brasileira de 16 anos, natural de Balneário Camboriú (SC), morreu em um bombardeio no Líbano na segunda-feira, 23, disseram familiares ao Estadão nesta quinta-feira, 26. O caso, ainda não confirmado pelo Ministério das Relações Exteriores (MRE), seria a segunda morte de um brasileiro em território libanês desde a escalada de bombardeios entre Israel e o grupo Hezbollah.\nDe acordo com Ali Hussein Nasser, tio da vítima, a jovem identificada como Mirna Raef Nasser estava no Vale do Bekaa, mesma região onde Ali Kamal Abdallah, o brasileiro de 16 anos de Foz do Iguaçu, morreu também na segunda-feira. Ela estava acompanhada do pai Raef Nasser, que é libanês, e que também morreu no ataque.\nMirna mudou-se para o Líbano quando tinha 1 ano e 2 meses de idade, depois que o pai foi visitar o país e decidiu permanecer após arrumar um emprego, conta o tio da jovem. Lá, além do pai, ela morava com a mãe, dois irmãos e uma irmã.\nSegundo Ali Hussein Nasser, na segunda-feira a família havia deixado a casa no norte do Líbano pela manhã e voltaram pela parte da tarde para buscar roupas e materiais escolares, momento em que a casa foi atingida. \"Ela falou (aos irmãos), vocês fiquem aqui, a gente vai lá e busca rápido. Na hora que eles chegaram em casa, aconteceu o ataque\", disse o tio. \"Foi violento, não sobrou nada da casa. Não tem nada, nada.\"\nIsrael e o Hezbollah têm trocado tiros através da fronteira desde o início da atual guerra em Gaza no ano passado, mas Israel intensificou sua campanha militar na última semana.\nNesta quinta-feira, 26, o Exército de Israel anunciou que, durante a madrugada, atacou 75 alvos do Hezbollah no sul e leste do Líbano. Na segunda-feira, ataques israelenses em larga escala no Líbano mataram 558 pessoas e feriram mais de 1.800, segundo as autoridades libanesas, o maior número em apenas um dia desde o fim da guerra civil no país (1975-1990).\nSegunda vítima brasileira no Líbano\nEssa é a segunda perda em território libanês desde a escalada entre Israel e Hezbollah na família de Ali Hussein Nasser, que é primo do brasileiro Ali Kamal Abdallah, cuja morte o Itamaraty confirmou nesta quinta-feira. \"Chegou a informação do menino. Falei, eu vou ligar para meu irmão, e ele não me respondeu. Duas horas depois, veio a notícia do (falecimento) meu irmão.\"\nAli Kamal Abdallah morreu em explosões na segunda-feira. Natural de Foz de Iguaçu, no Paraná, o jovem estava acompanhado do pai, que é paraguaio, na região do vale do Bekaa, a cerca 30 quilômetros a leste da capital Beirute. As autoridades do governo federal afirmaram que a embaixada do Brasil em Beirute está prestando assistência aos familiares.\nAtenção! Os comentários do site são via Facebook.

    "text": "Imagine you’re a fairywren living in a patch of scrub behind a schoolyard in the suburbs. It’s been pretty nice so far, but a recent increase in neighbourhood cats and the council’s insect control tactics mean it’s time to look for somewhere safer to live.\nThere’s a problem, though. You’re a small, bright blue bird that tends to make short flights from shrub to shrub, staying safe in the foliage. Beyond your little patch of habitat, there don’t seem to be any places you can easily access. On one side are wide-open sportsfields; on the other, a busy six-lane road. Where do you go?\nIt’s a bad situation for a fairywren, and for many other native species in cities. In ecology, we call this habitat fragmentation.\nThe map of suitable habitat for city-dwelling wildlife often looks like a scattering of islands in an inhospitable sea of other land uses. These species face threats or barriers such as roads, buildings, fences and feral predators. This poses several issues, such as barring access to feeding areas, increasing competition for nesting spaces within habitat patches and even reducing gene flow by making it hard to find mates.\nOur newly published research shows how native species in our cities can benefit if we focus on creating strategically located green spaces to connect isolated patches of habitat.\nNative species are at risk whenever they venture beyond the safety of urban habitat patches. MomentsForZen/Flickr , CC BY-NC-ND Why we should care for urban species Despite the myriad challenges facing plants, animals and insects in urban areas, cities are important places to take care of our native species. Urban areas still offer valuable nesting and feeding resources, especially for tree-dwelling mammals, canopy-feeding birds and water-adapted species.\nIn addition to their value for conservation , urban habitats are precious spaces for people to encounter nature in the places we live and work . Urban nature has been shown to be important in balancing out the stresses of city life, particularly in disadvantaged communities . It’s also good for our physical health and social connectedness – it even improves cognitive development in children .\nUnsurprisingly, studies have shown people want more nature in their cities.\nBut actively supporting native species hasn’t generally been the norm in many cities. The practice of planning and design to deliberately bring nature back into urban areas is still developing. Our open-access research paper in Landscape and Urban Planning offers insights into how we can tackle one aspect of the problem: habitat fragmentation.\nThami Croeser explains the research findings on how best to create links between fragmented wildlife habitat. What did the study look at? We examined how greening projects could best connect up habitat for New Holland honeyeaters ( Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ), blue-banded bees ( Amegilla spp ) and mole crickets ( Gryllotalpa spp ) in Melbourne, Victoria. These are all species that occur locally but experience some degree of habitat fragmentation.\nWe have a lot of greening to do for climate adaptation and to create open space for new residents in our growing cities. What if we could also do this greening in a way that boosts habitat for non-human residents too?\nWe compared a scenario where a large number of small green spaces (formerly parking spaces) were created mainly for climate adaptation purposes, to a pair of scenarios where a smaller number of green spaces were created exclusively in areas that had been identified as key links between habitat fragments.\nMaps showing the areas targeted for creating green spaces to link fragmented patches of habitat. T. Croeser et al 2024 , CC BY What were the findings? In total, the benefit of each space in the targeted scenario was more than double that of the scenario where we placed green spaces for climate adaptation purposes, even with the same design of individual green spaces.\nHere’s an image of the kind of green spaces we modelled in this study.\nA biodiverse green space with a street tree (1), habitat resources such as understorey plants (2) and stormwater infiltration using a sunken ‘raingarden’ design (3) effectively de-paves the area of the parking space (4). T. Croeser et al 2022 , CC BY We found significant benefits for two of our three species when green spaces were located in a way that specifically targeted habitat connections.\nBlue-banded bees and mole crickets did especially well. It is trickier for these small creatures to navigate the space between habitat patches. When these small green spaces provided “stepping stones” between bigger patches, they greatly increased the area of habitat a bee or cricket could reach.\nBlue-banded bees greatly benefited from creating green spaces to connect isolated patches of habitat. AjayTvm/Shutterstock Mole crickets aren’t made for travelling long distances between areas of suitable habitat. Donald Hobern/Flickr , CC BY Linking up habitats when we create new green spaces is one way to give native species a chance in our cities. It also gives us (and our kids) a better chance of having everyday nature experiences.\nOf course, adding this “ecosystem connectivity” lens to our green space planning isn’t a biodiversity panacea. We’ll still need to deliver a lot of new greenery.\nAnd we’ll have to design it carefully to support native animals while also providing cooling, reduced flood risk and recreational spaces. We also need to make sure we’re picking the right species to model our maps on, and then design our spaces for.\nStill, if we get this right, that fairywren might just one day have small, green “stepping stones” to find their way around the city to a happy new home.\nUrban wildlife Native species Nature in cities Habitat fragmentation Urban nature Urban green space Human connection to nature Native habitat Better Cities New research, Australia New Zealand",

    "text": "(WBBM NEWSRADIO) – Bald eagle sightings are being touted in places you might not have thought of in the Chicago area. The Chicago Park District says the raptors have been regularly seen at Big Marsh Park on the Southeast Side as well as along the North Branch of the Chicago River at Horner Park. “The bald eagles are so big, and they’re so close to the ground often times that you don’t need binoculars,” says Stephen Bell, director of the Ford Calumet Environmental Center at Big Marsh Park. Big Marsh Park connects to Lake Calumet, which joins the Calumet River, which links to Lake Michigan. “All of that open space and water provides ideal habitats for large birds, like bald eagles,” Bell said. There have been six bald eagles spotted at Big Marsh Park this year, but that as many as 12 have been spotted in previous years, he said. “Right now, they’re very visible because they’re going through their courtship process, which is where the eagles will do specific calls and acrobatics.” The Park District along with the Chicago Bird Alliance and the Chicago Ornithological Society have begun a Bird Photo Contest. Between now and Aug. 1, people can submit pictures of any of the 350 species of birds they spot in the city. Winners will receive $100 cash and have their pictures professionally displayed at Big Marsh Park. Also on the Chicago bird front, the Chicago Park District board has renamed the Montrose Dune Expansion Area after the Piping Plovers that made the area a regular nesting spot. It’s now known as the Monty and Rose Wildlife Habitat.

    "text": "Infrastructure\nGreenlight For Rs 76,000 Crore Mega Container Port In Vadhavan As Project Receives Environmental Clearance\nAmit Mishra\nFeb 16, 2024, 04:23 PM | Updated 04:23 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nThe path is now clear for the Vadhavan port as it has secured environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).\nIt is worth noting that just last week, the Rs 76,220 crore container port project at Vadhavan was recommended for coastal clearance by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).\nFollowing this, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA), leading the project, applied for environmental clearance from the Environment Ministry.\nIn all probability Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to perform the ground breaking ceremony for the project, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.\nThe project received a new lease of life when it received a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA) on 31 July 2023, following a comprehensive four-year examination by experts to ensure compliance with all environmental laws.\nThe application for NOC was one of the compliances mandated by the environment ministry before going ahead with the project.\nVadhavan: A Mega Port Near Mumbai\nThe Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in February 2020, had approved setting up Vadhavan Port under the Sagarmala Programme.\nSituated in the environmentally sensitive Dahanu taluka within Maharashtra’s Palghar district, Vadhavan Port boasts a natural draft of approximately 20 metres near the shore.\nThis feature makes it well-suited for accommodating larger container vessels ranging from 16,000 to 25,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), offering the benefits of economies of scale and contributing to the reduction of logistics costs.\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and Mundra, the two largest container handling ports in India, can handle only mid-size container ships as they have drafts of 15 and 16 metres respectively. However, in comparison, the world's largest container ports require deeper drafts of 18-20 meters.\nAs container ships continue to increase in size, it becomes essential to develop a deep draft container port on the west coast of India to accommodate these larger vessels. The proposed port in Maharashtra is anticipated to have a capacity of over 23 million TEUs by 2040, positioning India among the top 10 container ports globally.\nAdditionally, the construction of the greenfield port at Vadhavan is crucial to manage overflow traffic due to limitations on expansion at Nhava Sheva, where JN Port is situated.\nLandlord Model\nDesignated as a major port under the Indian Ports Act of 1908 , the Vadhavan port is the first major port to be developed in partnership with a state government.\nIt is being developed by Vadhavan Port Project Ltd (VPPL) — a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and the Maharashtra Maritime Board — with a shareholding of 74 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. The port will be developed in two phases under the landlord model, with an investment of Rs 76,220 crore.\nAnticipated to redefine the landscape of Palghar district, this port is poised to become one of the largest in the region, heralding a new era of growth.\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nAn appeal from Swarajya\nDear Reader,\nAt Swarajya, we rely on our readers' support through subscriptions to sustain our media platform.

    "text": "By Jessica Hullinger ,\n9 hours ago Heatmap Illustration/Getty Images\nCurrent conditions: Another atmospheric river is taking aim at southern Oregon and northern California • Temperatures in southeastern Australia could reach 113 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend for the first time in four years • Nearly 50 inches of snow have been recorded in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nTHE TOP FIVE 1. Climate change made typhoon season much worse for the Philippines Climate change “supercharged” this year’s typhoon season in the Philippines, according to new research from the World Weather Attribution. Six typhoons slammed into the country in November alone, double the “typical” number of storms for the month. At one point, four typhoons were churning in the Pacific basin simultaneously. Some areas were hit three times, highlighting “the challenges of adapting to back-to-back extreme weather events.” More than 170 people were killed, and the estimated economic toll is nearly half a billion dollars. “The storms were more likely to develop more strongly and reach the Philippines at a higher intensity than they otherwise would have,” said Ben Clarke, a weather researcher at Imperial College London and one of the authors on the report.

Biden administration urges SCOTUS to reject appeals from Big Oil in climate cases A couple of Supreme Court updates today: The Biden administration is recommending the Court reject an appeal from a group of Big Oil firms regarding a 2023 ruling out of Hawaii that permitted Honolulu to sue Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and Sunoco for allegedly lying to the public about the climate damages caused by burning fossil fuels. The Hawaii Supreme Court initially rejected the companies’ claim that the suit was overstepping into regulatory territory reserved for the federal government. The solicitor general is also urging the Supreme Court to reject an attempt by 19 GOP state attorneys general to block a lawsuit from five Democratic-led states against major oil companies.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court this week said it would not pause an EPA rule, issued earlier this year, requiring the cleanup of coal ash dumping sites. A Kentucky electric utility had requested the rule be put on hold.\n3. With bankruptcy looming, Nikola announces more layoffs Beleaguered hydrogen-battery electric truck company Nikola is scrambling to avoid bankruptcy by laying off another chunk of its workforce. It cut 15% of its staff back in October, and it’s unclear how deep this next round will be. The company is losing about $200 million a quarter, Electrek reported . Earlier this week Nikola announced it would sell company shares to try to raise $100 million. In a filing with the SEC, the company wrote : “We currently estimate that our existing financial resources are only adequate to fund our forecasted operating costs and meet our obligations into, but not through, the first quarter of 2025.”\n4. Google to buy carbon removal credits from ERW startup Terradot In case you missed it: A carbon removal startup backed by Google and Microsoft launched yesterday with nearly $60 million in funding. Terradot is one of several companies utilizing enhanced rock weathering (by spreading crushed rock over farmland) to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Coinciding with the launch, Google announced it was purchasing 200,000 tons of removal credits from Terradot to be delivered by the early 2030s, which the tech giant said is its largest ERW deal to date and its first direct investment in an ERW company. In all, Terradot launches with signed agreements to remove nearly 300,000 tons of CO2. The company has a scaled pilot in Brazil.\n“To unlock enhanced rock weathering as a useful tool for CO2 removal, we need to deploy it at scale and learn how to measure the results rigorously using real-world data,” said Google’s head of carbon credits and removals, Randy Spock. “Terradot is well-positioned to do that work in an especially promising geography, and we’re excited to support them to help deliver significant amounts of CO2 removal both for Google’s net zero goal and for the planet.”\n5. Marine heat wave killed 4 million birds in Alaska New research published in the journal Science concluded that a recent marine heat wave killed off more than half of Alaska’s population of common murres, resulting in “the largest documented wildlife mortality event in the modern era.” In total, some 4 million of the birds died between 2014 and 2016 due to fish die-off from rising temperatures in the north Pacific. “Population abundance estimates since then have found no evidence of recovery,” the researchers wrote, “suggesting that the heatwave may have led to an ecosystem shift.”\nA common murre colony in Alaska in 2014 and 2021.

Visit image gallery to purchase the image.\nNews Australia 0 Comments About 110 Australians died on roads every month during the past year, in the deadliest period in more than a decade.\nA 10.2 percent spike in deaths in the year to July 31 meant 1327 people were killed on Australian roads, a figure that hadn't been achieved since October 2012.\nFive Australian jurisdictions had an increase in deaths in the year to July 31 compared with the previous 12-month window, including a staggering 174 percent jump in the Northern Territory.\nSixty-three people died in the NT in the period, compared to 23 in the window before.\nNew South Wales had a hefty 17.1 percent jump, while Victoria's road toll spiked 9.3 percent.\nSouth Australia, Tasmania and the ACT were the only jurisdictions where the road toll fell.\nThe decade-long National Road Safety Strategy that aimed to halve road deaths by 2030 was nowhere near meeting its objectives, Australian Automobile Association managing director Michael Bradley said.\nSince the strategy was implemented in 2021, road deaths had increased 17.4 percent, Mr Bradley said.\n\"We are losing 110 lives each month and heading in the wrong direction at alarming speed,\" he said.\n\"These latest figures are not some kind of one-off, they represent an unacceptable trend.\"\nComparing year-on-year figures, it has been more than three years since Australia had a decline in road deaths.\nThe automobile association used the latest batch of figures to renew calls for more transparency around crash causes and road conditions to allow for a better understanding of what needs to be done to fix the crisis.\nFederal Transport Minister Catherine King in May said revealing the secretive crash data would be part of negotiations around commonwealth funding.\n\"A clear picture, underpinned by data, about where best to target road safety funding will save lives and ensure we are investing in the projects that will make the biggest difference,\" Ms King said.\nBut Mr Bradley said those negotiations had not yet concluded and it was time for the states and territories to get on board.\n\"Data sharing will reveal which state's road safety measures are the most effective, and the safety interventions that are most needed,\" he said.\n\"That will not only save lives, but also clip the wings of pork-barrelling politicians by revealing whether governments are funding roads to save lives or win votes in marginal electorates.\"\nAAP Related Stories Australian girl confirmed as London stabbing victim All eyes on deportees as Luxon lands in Australia Woman charged with murder of girl on Gold Coast Bluesfest to wind up after three-decade run Kiwi killed in Cairns chopper crash remembered as 'good fella' Chopper pilot in fatal hotel crash had NZ licence Fatal Cairns chopper crash 'could have been a lot worse' Pilot dead after chopper crashes into Cairns hotel Leaders dance to aid of under-fire Olympian 'Raygun' Girl, 14, charged with murder in Queensland Renowned croc expert jailed for 'grotesque' sexual abuse of dogs Aussie hockey player caught buying drugs",
