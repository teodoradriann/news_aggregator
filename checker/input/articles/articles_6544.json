    "text": "HPV感染風險不分男女！ 9月起國二男生也能公費接種\n【NOW健康 陳如頤／台北報導】台灣今年9月起擴大公費HPV疫苗接種，除了國中小女生，連國二男生也納入接種對象，領先日韓等國，創下東亞先例。台灣耳鼻喉頭頸外科醫學會理事長、台大醫院副院長婁培人呼籲，政府持續擴大接種對象，將高中生、大學生與未接種成人也提供公費接種，另結合職場健檢政策，提高全民免疫力。\n今年9月起國中男生納入公費HPV接種對象 領先日本與韓國\n國健署長吳昭軍表示，接種HPV疫苗有助於降低HPV相關癌症與疾病等風險，為此，2018年起針對國中女生提供HPV疫苗公費接種，近2年接種率高達9成，提前達到WHO消除子宮頸癌「90%的15歲女孩已接種過HPV疫苗」目標。\n吳昭軍說，今年9月起將國中男生納入接種對象，屆時台灣將領先日本與韓國，成為東亞第一個男女共同施打的國家。目前國二男生約10萬人，接種率8至9成，推估今年約8萬人受惠，如果加上女學生，則有近18萬人受惠，公費疫苗經費4.7億元。\nHPV疫苗是繼B肝疫苗後 第2個透過接種能有效預防癌症的疫苗\n台灣癌症基金會副執行長蔡麗娟表示，HPV疫苗是繼B肝疫苗之後，第2個透過接種，即能有效預防癌症的疫苗。希望國中生的家長在收到接種同意書上，均能簽名同意，讓孩子接種疫苗，降低罹癌機率。\n全國家長會長聯盟理事長張哲維表示，自己於多年前感冒，就醫時意外發現咽喉部腫瘤，經診斷與HPV有關。他以自身經驗為例，提醒年輕父母，除了幫孩子安排施打，自己也應接種，以期建立完整的家庭防線。\nHPV感染與多種癌症密切相關 大部分感染者因性行為接觸病毒\n婁培人指出，HPV感染與多種癌症密切相關，除了引發子宮頸癌，也會提高男性常見的頭頸癌（口咽、口腔、鼻咽癌等）、肛門癌等風險，這也是感染菜花（生殖器疣）的危險因子。\n「即便是單一性伴侶，甚至沒有性生活的人，仍然可能感染HPV！」婁培人說，絕大部分HPV感染者係因性行為而接觸病毒，但也可能透過接觸皮膚傷口、黏膜或體液感染。\n台灣感染症醫學會號召8大醫學會 提出「台灣成人HPV疫苗指引」\n美國流行病學研究指出，18歲至59歲男性每2人就有1位生殖系統感染HPV，感染後不易出現病徵，也沒有像女性子宮頸抹片這類常規檢查，更容易在不知情之下傳染給另一半。\n台灣感染症醫學會代表林冠吟醫師表示，無論男女，一生中感染HPV的機率高達5至9成，雖然9成感染者體內病毒會在1年內清除，但仍有少數持續感染，進而惡化致癌。\n為此，台灣感染症醫學會近期號召8大醫學會，共同提出「台灣成人HPV疫苗指引」，呼籲即使已有性經驗或曾感染HPV，仍應接種疫苗，以預防其他型別感染。\n# 首圖來源／Freepik\nNOW健康：FB │ IG │ Threads │ YT │ 官方LINE │ 醫級邦 │ 健康安妞 Podcast\n❤溫馨提醒：歡迎轉傳「原始文章連結」分享，未經授權，請勿複製圖文轉貼本文。",

    "title": "Which Trees Have The Best Fall Leaves? Our Top Picks",
    "text": "Contents\nThe autumn landscape can be a most breathtaking scene to behold. Trees change their leaves to shades of crimson, mahogany, bronze, and gold, rolling over hillsides and lighting up the sky. Paired with the cooling temperatures and holiday anticipation, it’s truly an enchanting time to be outdoors enjoying nature.\nWhen it comes to fall color , not all trees are equal. Scientific reactions are responsible for those vivid hues. As the equinox passes and we see fewer daylight hours, the decrease in daylight means less photosynthesis .\nThe decrease in photosynthesis means that the tree produces less chlorophyll . When you see those brilliant shades of yellow and orange , you see the color of the leaves without chlorophyll. Some leaves are brighter underneath than others, which simply turn brown.\nShades of red and violet appear because of the presence of anthocyanins , which develop when sugars get trapped in the leaves. Maples, oaks, and dogwood trees are likely to produce these colors.\nScience aside, autumn leaves are one of my favorite things about the season. Not only are they beautiful to behold, but they are also a harbinger of celebratory times ahead. Here are 15 of my favorite fall trees with the best leaves.\nAmerican Beech The leaves are simple, heavily veined, and slightly toothy. common name American Beech botanical name Fagus grandifolia sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 50’-80’ hardiness zones 3-9 American beech is a slow grower with smooth, gray bark and a full, dense canopy . The leaves are simple, heavily veined, and slightly toothy. In spring and summer, they are a gorgeous blue-green shade. When autumn starts to creep in, those leaves change to brilliant bronze and gold.\nThese trees need at least partial exposure and grow quite large over time. They need moist, well-drained soil that is slightly acidic and rich in nutrients. After the first few years, they need little pruning or maintenance and provide a lot of interest in the landscape.\nBlack Tupelo In addition to its fall leaves, it has interesting, scaly bark that adds interest in winter. common name Black Tupelo botanical name Nyssa sylvatica sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 30’-70’ hardiness zones 4-9 Famed for the honey produced from its nectar , the Black Tupelo is an easy-going tree with reliably wonderful autumn colors. Its flowers are inconspicuous but are a great food source for bees. In addition to its fall leaves, it has interesting, scaly bark that adds interest in winter.\nThe foliage lights up in shades of red, orange, yellow, and purple , with small bluish-black berries that attract birds. It has an oval growth habit and matures to between 30 ‘and 70’ tall . It’s not picky about exposure or soil as long as it doesn’t have wet feet.\nGinkgo They have beautiful and unique fan-shaped foliage that is a lovely bluish-green in summer. common name Ginkgo botanical name Ginkgo biloba sun requirements Full sun height 25’-80’ hardiness zones 3-9 Ginkgos are amazingly long-lived and fascinating trees. The oldest specimen in the world is more than 3,000 years old ! These truly get better and more beautiful with age. They have beautiful and unique fan-shaped foliage that is a lovely bluish-green in summer. For as lovely as they are throughout the year, ginkgos are a glorious golden spectacle in fall.\nPlant your ginkgo in a place where it gets a lot of light. They are drought tolerant and prefer sandy, well-drained soil . Make sure to loosen up and amend your soil if it is clay-heavy or compacts easily. They can live in Zones 3-9 but thrive best in more of a mid-range. Too much heat will decrease a ginkgo’s drought tolerance .\nServiceberry As the days get shorter, serviceberry’s foliage changes to glowing red, gold, and orange embers. common name Serviceberry botanical name Amelanchier arborea sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 15’-30’ hardiness zones 3-9 Serviceberry is a member of the rose family and a more compact tree. At a mature height of 15 to 30 feet , it fits well in more modest spaces, and you can plant it closer to the house without fear of root damage.\nFirst, this tree is known for its spectacular spring floral display. When it blooms, it looks like a fluffy white cloud . As the days get shorter, serviceberry’s foliage changes to glowing red, gold, and orange embers . It glows in any garden space.\nIn its first year, remember to keep the soil moist . Giving your serviceberry a layer of mulch around the base will help retain moisture in the soil. Trees that get more moisture produce more and better-quality, edible berries .\nSugar Maple Its attractive rounded crown makes it an ideal shade tree, and the vermilion, orange, and yellow foliage stands out in fall. common name Sugar Maple botanical name Acer saccharum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 40’-120’ hardiness zones 3-8 You’ll find sugar maple on any list of this kind. It’s simply one of the most flamboyant and reliable sources of autumn foliage around. Its attractive rounded crown makes it an ideal shade tree, and the vermilion, orange, and yellow foliage stands out in fall.\nMaple trees are generally well-loved for this reason. Sugar maple has the highest concentration of sugar of any species , which adds a lot of red tones. Sugar maples like well-drained, acidic soil , but they prefer it not to be too wet or dry. Give your sugar maple space from footpaths or driveways. Their roots are a bit sensitive .\nSassafrass In autumn, they change to shades of orange, yellow, and red, sometimes even a deep burgundy. common name Sassafrass botanical name Sassafras albidum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 30’-80’ hardiness zones 4-9 Sassafrass is a North American native with a rich history of use among Indigenous people. Female trees produce pretty yellow flowers in the spring, and the resulting berries feed birds and other wildlife. The plant also plays host to the spicebush swallowtail butterfly .\nThe foliage is an interesting part of sassafras. The leaves aren’t all the same shape —some are ovoid—but the ends of branches hold interesting, tri-lobed leaves. When young, they have a citrus aroma . In autumn, they change to shades of orange, yellow, and red, sometimes even a deep burgundy.\nEastern Redbud The heart-shaped leaves change from bright green to various warm colors, and the ‘Heart of Gold’ cultivar turns bright yellow. common name Eastern Redbud botanical name Cercis canadensis sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-30’ hardiness zones 4-9 This member of the legume family is a double threat, with stunning spring flowers and incredible autumn foliage. It’s a compact tree with peeling bark that also provides winter interest. The heart-shaped leaves change from bright green to various warm colors, and the ‘Heart of Gold’ cultivar turns bright yellow.\nFull sun exposure will make Eastern redbud produce the most flowers. The rounded crown is a product of many horizontally tiered branches. Moist, well-drained soil is ideal, and it needs a winter chill to set buds.\nOhio Buckeye The fall color can span the spectrum from red to gold, with orange being the most common. common name Ohio Buckeye botanical name Aesculus glabra sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-40’ hardiness zones 3-7 Ohio buckeye is another mid-sized tree that blends well in most landscapes. It has a broad crown that is often slightly pointed on top. This is a bloomer, but the flowers are not highly visible among the leaves. They are, however, attractive to pollinators. The resulting fruit is poisonous .\nThe fall color can span the spectrum from red to gold , with orange being the most common. Ohio buckeye makes a lovely shade tree. It prefers well-drained soil and is otherwise unfussy about composition and pH. It likes moderate moisture.\nJapanese Stewartia Before it loses its leaves, they turn bright red and orange. common name Japanese Stewartia botanical name Stewartia pseudocamellia sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 12’-40’ hardiness zones 5-8 It’s sad that I live in Zone 9, just out of range of this wonderful tree. It is often called deciduous camellia because of their physical similarities. The white blossoms are similar to those of Camellia sinensis , the green tea plant.\nWhere camellias are evergreen, Japanese Stewartia is deciduous. Before it loses its leaves, they turn bright red and orange. Its attractive peeling bark gives this tree year-round appeal . It’s fairly compact and fits well in most landscapes. It’s a winner of the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.\nCoral Bark Japanese Maple With foliage that changes from neon yellow to green to scarlet over the course of the year, this is a wonderful focal point. common name Coral Bark Japanese Maple botanical name Acer palmatum ‘Sango-kaku’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-25’ hardiness zones 6-8 Another Award of Garden Merit winner, coral bark maple is a stunner. With foliage that changes from neon yellow to green to scarlet over the course of the year, this is a wonderful focal point in any landscape. In winter, it’s no less stunning. After the leaves fall, the brilliant coral bark adds beauty to the colder months.\nCoral bark maple is a slow grower and small at maturity , making it versatile. It likes rich, moist, acidic soil and is otherwise easy to grow. Just be sure to keep the soil moist, as this tree can dry out easily, leading to leaf scorch.\nFullmoon Maple Rather than the typical maple shape, the leaves on this species are circular with toothy, pointed edges. common name Fullmoon Maple botanical name Acer japonicum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 15’-30’ hardiness zones 5-7 Fullmoon maple is a delicate and beautiful specimen tree with uniquely beautiful foliage. Rather than the typical maple shape , the leaves on this species are circular with toothy, pointed edges . It is slow-growing , with a wide, spreading crown and smooth gray bark.\nThis maple prefers cool weather and won’t tolerate hot summers. In autumn, its leaves turn shades of red and bronze. The ‘Aconitifolium’ variety is an Award winner with fernlike leaves that turn scarlet. Varieties can range widely in size, from medium-sized shrubs to small trees.\nAmerican Smoke Tree In autumn, the foliage shifts to orange, purple, and red shades. common name American Smoke Tree botanical name Cotinus obovatus sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-30’ hardiness zones 3-8 This is an incredibly interesting tree from a visual standpoint. American Smoke Tree is the way to go if you’re looking for something that will stand out. The leaves are pink in spring , and large plumes of small, fluffy flowers appear and stay into the summer months. They look like clouds of smoke surrounding the crown.\nIn autumn, the foliage shifts to orange, purple, and red shades . This mid-sized tree is native to the United States and is low maintenance , requiring no regular pruning. Butterflies are attracted to the flowers, and deer typically leave it alone.\nCrape Myrtle As the daylight hours grow shorter, crape myrtle foliage lights up in vivid orange and red with purple accents. common name Crape Myrtle botanical name Lagerstroemia indica sun requirements Full sun height 6’-30’ hardiness zones 6-9 Crape myrtles are well suited for warmer climates . Their magnificent floral displays in summer and attractive, peeling bark make them year-round beauties. As the daylight hours grow shorter, crape myrtle foliage lights up in vivid orange and red with purple accents here and there.\nAs the tree ages, the exfoliating bark will become more prominent, adding beauty to the winter landscape. Pruning this tree is an ongoing task until it matures. Just don’t commit crape murder. Lopping your tree off at the top can shorten its lifespan.\nQuaking Aspen This is a distinctive tree with incredible, gleaming, golden autumn leaves. common name Quaking Aspen botanical name Populous tremuloides sun requirements Full sun height 40’-50’ hardiness zones 1-6 If you have a significant space to fill and you want a fast grower , consider a quaking aspen. This is a distinctive tree with incredible, gleaming, golden autumn leaves . The smooth white bark is striking in winter, as well.\nQuaking Aspen is a large, vigorous grower that tolerates very cold temperatures . It’s the only tree on our list that you can grow in Zone 1 ! The name comes from the sound its foliage makes when the slightest breeze blows through.\nKousa Dogwood They produce a lot of anthocyanins, so their autumn foliage is mostly red and purple. common name Kousa Dogwood botanical name Cornus kousa sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-30’ hardiness zones 5-8 Kousa Dogwood is a chameleon . It grows slowly, changing from an upright juvenile to becoming more conical as it matures before finally spreading out. It’s very decorative, with white flowers in early summer that give way to red berries in late summer. Its lightly peeling bark makes it interesting in winter.\nDogwoods have wonderful fall colors. They produce a lot of anthocyanins , so their autumn foliage is mostly red and purple, though some orange may appear as well. This color lasts three to five weeks , and the red berries stick around longer for the birds to enjoy.",

    "text": "With this Crescent Lasagna recipe you get all the flavors of lasagna between flaky layers of crescent roll dough. A meaty meat sauce and cream cheese layer are sandwiched between layers of buttery crescent dough to make an unbelievably delicious family meal.\nCrescent Roll Dough\nThis recipe makes use of one of my favorite kitchen shortcuts- refrigerated Crescent Roll Dough. I use Pillsbury Crescent Roll Dough. You can use either the crescent dough or crescent sheets. If using crescent dough, you will have to press on the perforations to seal them. I also love to use crescent dough to make these\nSloppy Joe Squares, Crescent Beef Burritos, and Sausage and Crescent Roll Casserole.\nMeat Filling\nA super thick tomato meat sauce, with both ground beef and Italian sausage for supreme flavor, is spread on top of a rectangle of crescent roll dough.\nCheese Filling\nNext comes a cheese mixture made from cottage cheese, 2 eggs, and Parmesan cheese. If you don’t like cottage cheese, use ricotta cheese. I think using cottage cheese for a lasagna is a southern thing. But even if you think you don’t like cottage cheese, try it for lasagna. It is super, super creamy.\nA thick layer of shredded mozzarella cheese comes next and then a second can of crescent roll dough is unrolled and placed on top.\nThe only slightly tricky part of this recipe is getting the top and bottom layers of crescent roll dough sealed around the edges. And it’s difficult to get it perfectly shaped.\nBut with a meal that tastes this yummy, does it really matter what it looks like?\nVariations and Substitutions\n- Use all ground beef or all Italian sausage.\n- Use ground turkey to make it a little lighter.\n- Make it spicy. Add half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.\n- Sub ricotta cheese for cottage cheese.\n- Add sauteed mushrooms.\nCan Crescent Lasagna Be Frozen?\nYes! Bake the lasagna and let it cool completely. Wrap it in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months.\nMeat sauce, gooey cheese, and buttery dough is always a winning combination!\nNever miss a recipe.
