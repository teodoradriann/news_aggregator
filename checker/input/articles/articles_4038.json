    "text": "LaVerne Campbell was born to serve.\nHer mission carried on even after she retired from her 50-year nursing career in 2018. Now, she is applying her skillset at Beth Eden Baptist Church in southeast Fort Worth as its faith community nurse.\nIn addition to tending to minor cuts and scratches, she and other nurses in the church are often a resource for general education on diseases. Congregants in Campbell’s church have her on speed dial, she said, for support or referrals for other kinds of professional help.\nCampbell said that her church’s nursing ministry was reduced from eight members to three after the COVID-19 pandemic. The physical and emotional demand of caring for congregants with chronic health issues such as diabetes, hypertension and autoimmune diseases with her smaller team can sometimes be “overwhelming,” she said.\nCampbell is not alone. She was one of many laypeople who attended the Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit. The April 22 event was designed to offer fellowship to people in both the faith and health fields while discussing topics like mental health, congregational welfare and sustaining health ministries in North Texas.\n“I love what I do. I love tending to their needs, and I love being able to see them get better and change their lifestyle,” Campbell said. “But I have to intentionally unplug, and sometimes I don’t always do that for myself, so it was a good reminder of the caregiver needing to unplug and learn to say no and just take really good care of yourself.”\nReligious leaders are not immune to experiencing mental illnesses and challenges. In 2015, 46% of clergy surveyed by the evangelical Christian polling firm Barna Group said that they had experienced depression at some point during their ministry. That number increased to 59% by 2020, according to the report .\nAbout 350 people attended the Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit on April 22, 2025, said David Tesmer, chief community and public policy officer for Texas Health Resources. (Marissa Greene | Fort Worth Report) Mental health and well-being is a “major issue for North Texas communities,” said David Tesmer, chief community and public policy officer for the faith-based system Texas Health Resources.\nThe nonprofit’s Faith Summit is a way to bring faith and health leaders together to share their experiences and learn about resources available to them from Texas Health Resources and other organizations at Tuesday’s event, he said.\n“They take on a lot,” Tesmer said. “They hear a lot about problems that individuals want to come in and talk to them about. Their cup kind of gets empty and they need to fill their cup up. So they’re asking us, ‘How can we take better care of ourselves so we can take care of others?’”\nCampbell and others gathered inside the Hurst Conference Center discussed the emotional toll of ministry. Four Tarrant County pastors shared how they try to keep themselves healthy in the pursuit of their role of ministering to their congregants.\n“Self-care has to start with the community,” said the Rev. Ralph S. Emerson, pastor of Rising Star Baptist Church located in southeast Fort Worth. He recommended having three tiers of connectivity.\n“You need somebody above you, who holds you accountable. … You need to have somebody beneath you that you can pour out into that responsibility for you to attend to them,” Emerson said. “And I think you just need good people connected to you, a real group of people who can kind of just sit and listen to you.”\nThe Rev. Ralph S. Emerson, pastor of Rising Star Baptist Church, speaks during a panel at Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit on April 22, 2025. (Marissa Greene | Fort Worth Report) It can be challenging to find time for yourself as a bi-vocational pastor, said the Rev. Dr. Gilbert Marez of Camino de Paz Christian Church, located near Fort Worth’s Oakhurst neighborhood.\nBi-vocational pastors have the same duties as full-time pastors but hold a second non-church job to supplement their ministry income.\nIn Marez’s experience, many Latino pastors work bi-vocationally because “churches are small, many of our parishioners are low-to-moderate income,” he said.\n“You’re trying to do two or three things at the same time, never mind the fact that you’re doing baptisms, you’re doing quinceañeras, you’re doing weddings, you’re doing counseling,” Marez said. “It gets very difficult to try to set some sort of standard.”\nFinding time to take breaks within the day can help, Marez said.\nThe Rev. Dr. Gilbert Marez shares how he navigates his mental health as a bi-vocational pastor for Camino de Paz Christian Church during a panel at the Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit on April 22, 2025. (Marissa Greene | Fort Worth Report) Understanding how your soul functions in the world will help you know how to rest, said the Rev. Johnny Brower, lead pastor of First United Methodist Church of Hurst. Taking personality tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment , or the Enneagram test can be the building blocks of understanding yourself better, he said.\n“When you have self-awareness, you understand how you move in the world, why certain things trigger you, why certain things upset you or make you sad,” Brower said. “Instead of just going ‘Oh gosh, what’s happening there?’ I begin to know. So not only can I give grace to others, I can give grace to myself and not beat myself up.”\nThe Rev. David Grebel, interim pastor of Celebration Community Church, tells attendees during a Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit panel how taking a sabbatical helped his mental health. (Marissa Greene | Fort Worth Report) The Rev. Johnny Brower, lead pastor of First United Methodist Church of Hurst, talks about how building self-awareness can help with mental health during the Texas Health Community Hope Faith Summit. (Marissa Greene | Fort Worth Report) Before the Rev. David Grebel became interim pastor of Celebration Community Church in southwest Fort Worth; he spent decades working a mix of higher education and pastoral roles.\nWhen it comes to thinking about how to stay in ministry for the long haul, taking a sabbatical helps, Grebel said.\n“I had the chance to stop and think through again who I wanted to be theologically, who I wanted to be as a pastor, who I wanted to be as a person,” Grebel said. “So for me, the biggest self-care thing is learning how to step away so I can step back in.”\nAs health ministry work continues to evolve, Campbell appreciates the fresh perspectives she got from the pastors, she said. She plans to take everything she learned to help her continue serving her church — something she doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.\n“I have to keep doing it, even though I don’t get paid to do this. It doesn’t matter,” Campbell said. “I love serving, because I know that’s what I’m supposed to do.”\nMarissa Greene is a Report for America corps member, covering faith for the Fort Worth Report.

    "text": "It wasn’t good news for the David Hogg-backed candidate Deja Foxx as the votes came in late last night in the race to be the Democrat nominee to fill Arizona’s 7th Congressional District seat.\nFoxx, who gained notoriety for her pointed remarks to then-Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake in 2017, had been touted by the mainstream press as a real challenger to the perceived favorite Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., whose death in office prompted the special primary and general election to replace him.\nWith about 77% of the vote tabulated in the special primary election, the 25-year-old influencer fell spectacularly short of winning the race. Instead, Grijalva is on track to win an outright majority of the vote in the race for her father’s old seat. Grijalva has marshaled about 62% of the vote compared to Foxx’s approximately 21% and former congressional intern Daniel Hernandez’s 14%.\nFoxx’s race was a bellwether case for whether Hogg’s political action committee—Leaders We Deserve—could make the difference in elevating younger activist-type candidates over the Democrat establishment . Indeed, Hogg’s organization is expected to spend a total of about $20 million by 2026’s conclusion.\nFoxx’s defeat is another hurdle for Hogg who left his position as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after just a few months on the job after he declined to sign a pledge promulgated by DNC Chair Ken Martin to remain neutral in Democrat primaries.\n“I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a vice chair—and it’s OK to have disagreements. What isn’t OK is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,” Hogg said in a statement around the time of his DNC departure.",

I FEEL LIKE I’M GOING TO BE DIGGING OUT AGAIN FOR A WEEK. YEAH, THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE. I THINK LUKE YEAH, SO MANY STRONG WINDS AND WE’RE COMPARING THEM TO HURRICANE FORCE WINDS A LOT. AND THEY WERE THEY WERE GETTING CLOSE TO ALMOST. HURRICANE TWO STATUS AT THE PEAK OF THIS LINE OF STORMS THAT CAME THROUGH. IF YOU GET A 95 MILE PER HOUR WIND, OUR HIGHEST REPORT WAS 92, BUT 95 WOULD BE HURRICANE TWO STATUS. SO THAT PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT. SO THESE ARE ALL THE DAMAGE REPORTS WE HAD OR THE REPORTS NOT JUST THE DAMAGE REPORTS. THE WIND DAMAGE REPORTS ARE THE DARKER BLUE ONES. THE LIGHTER BLUE ONES ARE JUST THE STRAIGHT LINE WIND REPORTS. AND WE HAD ONE TORNADO REPORT RIGHT THERE. UH, THAT WAS IN WESTERN POTTAWATOMIE COUNTY. AND HERE’S A ZOOMED OUT LOOK. YOU CAN SEE TOWARDS SALINE COUNTY. THAT’S WHEN THE STORMS REALLY GOT GOING. THEY REALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE WARMTH IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ALL THE INSTABILITY AS THEY GOT CLOSER TO THE OMAHA METRO. AND OF COURSE, ALL THE REPORTS. RIGHT SURROUNDING, UH, ALMOST A BULL’S EYE ON DOUGLAS COUNTY THERE. HERE’S A LOOK AT THE WIND REPORTS. AND THESE ARE GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THAT HALF HOUR TIME FRAME, THESE ARE ALL FROM OMAHA’S EPPLEY AIRFIELD. FIVE 59 62MPH. AND LOOK, LESS THAN TEN MINUTES LATER, WE’RE AT 90, AND WE SUSTAINED NEAR 90, OR AT LEAST IN THE 80S FOR ALMOST 20 MINUTES THERE. AND WERE ITS SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WIND GUST CRITERIA FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. SO THAT JUST PUTS IT INTO PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU WERE OUT FOR ANYWHERE FROM 550 TO 630 YESTERDAY, YOU FELT THESE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS. HERE’S A LOOK AT THE POWER OUTAGES RIGHT NOW. AND OF COURSE, THE WIND CAUSED ALL THESE 74,000 DOUGLAS 18,000 FOR SARPY SAUNDERS COUNTY, JUST ABOUT 2500 NOW. SO THAT’S GOING TO BE ONGOING. TRYING TO GET THAT POWER BACK ON THESE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. THERE’S A NICE LOOK AT THIS SUNSET COLORS 78 DEGREES. THE DEW POINT IS STILL A BIT STICKY AT 69. BUT WE HAVE A NORTH WIND. SO THAT SHOULD HELP DRY US OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND NOW THAT THIS SYSTEM IS WELL OFF TO OUR EAST, THAT’S WHAT SPARKED THE STORMS YESTERDAY. WE HAVE THIS NORTH WIND THAT’S COMING BEHIND IT. SO THAT’S USUALLY MORE COMFORTABLE SIGN AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THESE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. AND IT’S WHY WE’RE SO QUIET RIGHT NOW WITH THE CLEAR SKIES. 76 FOR PLATTSMOUTH 73, IN ATLANTIC, 77 FOR LINCOLN FREMONT 76. TEKAMAH 7765 IS WHERE WE START TOMORROW. SO THAT’S A LOT COOLER. YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK WE HAD A LOT OF DAYS. WE STARTED IN THE 70S. NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY TOMORROW MORNING. FAIRLY COMFORTABLE HEADING OUT THE DOOR AND THEN STILL GOING TO BE HOT FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH A HIGH TEMPERATURE NEAR 91 DEGREES, WHICH TODAY 89 FOR THAT HIGH TEMPERATURE. SO THAT BROKE AN EIGHT DAY STREAK OF 90 DEGREE DAYS OR HIGHER. SO IT LOOKS LIKE FRIDAY WE’RE GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK TO 90 OR HIGHER. CONTINUING SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. IMPACT WEATHER FOR SUNDAY BECAUSE OF THE HEAT 95 FOR A HIGH. HOW ABOUT MONDAY THOUGH? GETTING UP TO 96. SEVERE WEATHER THAT DAY FOR THE EXCESSIVE HEAT THAT’S IN THE FORECAST BY TUESDAY WE DROP THAT DOWN TO 85. THAT WILL BE COMFORTABLE. WE HAVEN’T PHELPS 80S, PARTICULARLY LOW 80S IN A WHILE, WHICH WE MIGHT GET ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY, BUT IT MIGHT COME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN.

    "text": "An Australian Cabinet minister on Friday rejected X Corp owner Elon Musk's allegation that the government intended to control all Australians' access to the internet through legislation that would ban young children from social media.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said Musk's criticism was unsurprising after the government introduced to Parliament on Thursday legislation that would fine platforms including X up to 150 million Australian dollars ($133 million) if they allow children under age 16 to hold social media accounts.\nThe idea that Elon Musk is not delighted with our steps to try and protect kids online is not an especially big surprise to us, nor does it trouble us greatly, Chalmers told reporters.\n The spat continues months of open hostility between the Australian government and the tech billionaire over regulators' efforts to reduce public harm from social media.\nParliament could pass legislation as soon as next week that would oblige X, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit and Instagram to ban young children from their platforms.\nThe legislation introduced on Thursday will be debated by lawmakers in Parliament on Monday.\nMore From This Section Russia supplied air defence missiles to N Korea in return for troops: Seoul European companies cut jobs amidst difficult economy, weak demand UK retail sales plunged more than expected before new govt's budget: ONS S Korea finds Russia supplied missiles to North Korea in return for troops COP29: 'X' factor could shape Global South's future, climate talks at Baku Musk responded to the legislation's introduction by posting on his platform, Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\nAsked if that was the government's intention, Chalmers replied, Of course not.\nElon Musk having that view about protecting kids online is entirely unsurprising to us. He's expressed similar views before, Chalmers said.\nOur job is not to come up with a social media policy to please Elon Musk. Our job is to put in place the necessary protection for kids online, Chalmers added.\nIn April, Musk accused Australia of censorship after an Australian judge temporarily ruled that X must block users worldwide from accessing a video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese responded by describing Musk as an arrogant billionaire who considered himself above the law and was out of touch with the public.\nAustralian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, the online safety watchdog who brought the court case against X, has said the legal battle led to online attacks against her and her family, including the release online of personal information without her permission, known as doxxing.\nShe said Musk had issued a dog whistle to 181 million users around the globe which resulted in her receiving death threats.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Elon Musk announces X is India's number one news app on App store Elon Musk blasts Australia's proposed law to ban social media for children Jeff Bezos hits back at Musk in sniping over Tesla, SpaceX holdings Musk's budget crusade may cause constitutional clash in Trump's 2nd term 'Jeff Bezos advised selling Tesla stocks thinking Trump would lose': Musk Topics : Elon Musk Australia Internet access Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "text": "Greenacres fire destroys seven homes in Omak; residents look ahead to recovery\nOMAK – Geoffrey Pearson drove to his property Monday night unsure if his house would still be standing.\nHe and his family had evacuated just hours before, passing neighbors’ houses engulfed in flames and black smoke.\nLuckily, his home was was mostly intact, albeit with windows severely smoke damaged and several fallen fence posts.\nHis mother’s residence was less fortunate. A wildfire destroyed the floors of her 18-year-old house, burning various items and furniture along the way.\nPearson reviewed the damage while walking around his mother’s property Wednesday afternoon, pausing to look at the gaping hole in a bedroom wall that responders knocked in to fight the fire.\n“That was in my bedroom when I was a kid,” he chuckled, pointing to a melted plastic alarm clock sitting atop a damaged wooden table.\nHer luscious green lawn was now a sandy brown due to the heat from the fire. Rows of plants in raised-bed gardens became wilted and yellowed. Piles of ash and splinters submerged in her above-ground pool completely coated it’s tiled floor.\n“We feel very fortunate,” he said. “We know there’s other people that are hurting a lot worse than we are.”\nTheir properties are just some of the those damaged in Okanogan County by the Greenacres fire, a fast-moving wildfire that started on county land Monday afternoon, destroying seven homes and 13 other structures.\nThe fire reached 1,013 acres and as of Wednesday is considered 50% contained. It’s cause remains under investigation.\nPearson was having a normal day at home when he noticed a wind so strong that it was shaking his house. Then, his wife Jocelyn spotted a fire just a few miles away, inching its way toward their property.\n“Then all of the sudden, the wind changed, and it went just right at us,” Pearson said.\nThough neither his nor his mother’s home is completely destroyed, they have a long way to go until they can safely live in either.\nYet they have no plans to give up on their property.\n“We’ll be here,” he said. “We’ll definitely make sure we have a better lawn and I won’t let sagebrush grow back on our property, but we love this community.”\nThe majority of the wildfire’s damage stretched along its namesake, Greenacres Road.\nWednesday, the single-lane road’s scenery was a mix of pockets of short tan brush followed by stretches of blackened grass and foliage. Some houses along the drive were reduced to charred rubble. Other properties were covered in flame retardant, sparing the land from the flames but immersing it in hot-pink dust.\nFlora Rogers, a born and raised Omak resident, was working at her job at city hall when she heard her supervisor’s scanner mention a fire on Greenacres road, the same road she lives along.\nShe raced to her property, following a fire truck and followed by a customer of hers who volunteered to help.\nRogers, along with her boyfriend Jason and more than a dozen community members and firefighters, worked throughout the night to keep the flames at bay and protect their neighbor’s property.\n“Sometimes it’s very hard to think, because you just can’t quite comprehend what you’re seeing,” Rogers said. “The only thing you can do is your best. And it just kept coming.”\nIn the end, her house stayed intact. But the fire didn’t leave without a cost.\nIt killed one of her beloved cats, and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of building materials and fencing.\n“There was a point where it had gotten really bad. You could not breathe. There was so much debris and dust in the air,” Rogers said\nRogers has been through this before. Ten years ago the Okanogan Complex fires caused by lightning strikes burned over 300,000 acres of land, including the same property she lives on today.\nThough the experience was scary, she was deeply impressed by the work the firefighters put in to stop the fire and save her house. Wanting to give back, she signed up to be a volunteer firefighter at 51 years old with no previous experience, and has been helping out ever since.\nThis year, she made sure her yard was prepared. She cultivated a large green space, used rocks instead of mulch and kept flammable items away from her house’s exterior. She also frequently weed-wacked the areas around her fence and power lines, maintaining a perimeter of shortened brush that can be extinguished easily.\nThough her prevention tactics made a difference, Rogers credits Omak’s strong community and the fast work of firefighting teams to preventing the fire from spreading futher.\n“This county has the best people out there working and I think it’s because they are protecting their friends and their family,” Rogers said. “We’re very, very luck to have those resources come in.”\nGuy Gifford, a public information officer at the Washington Department of Natural Resources, emphasized the need for preparation when it comes to wildfires.\nEmbers are the leading cause of home ignition. Since these can travel through the wind and land outside your house, it’s important to minimize the amount of flammable objects that are next to the house, he said. This includes brooms, newspapers, boxes and anything else that can easily catch on fire.\n“Just being aware of the things that if I took a match to it would have caught on fire,” he said. “Think of all of those the next time you walk around a house.”\nAnother aspect people should be cautious about is running sprinklers from public water systems during wildfires, he said.\n“If we all did that in my neighborhood, there’d be no water for the hydrants,” he said. We don’t really encourage people on public systems to run sprinklers because that takes away from the firefighters.”",

    "title": "Four-Star WR Jaime Ffrench added to the 2025 Polynesian Bowl",
    "text": "The 2025 Polynesian Bowl added another big-time player to this year's roster when Jacksonville (Fla.) Mandarin wide receiver [Jaime Ffrench](/Player/jaime-ffrench-46117166/) announced his commitment to this year's game. Ffrench is one of the nation’s top prospects, regardless of position. He’s rated the No. 30 player nationally in the Top247 and No. 13 in the 247Sports Composite. He’s coming off a dominant performance at the recent All-American Bowl Combine where he earned ‘Alpha Dog’ honors as the top overall performer in the event. He’s a dynamic pass catcher who can get easy separation and was turning opposing corners around all day. He had a big junior season, hauling in 62 passes for 1,247 yards and 14 touchdowns and has the talent to play for any school in the country. “I’m very pumped and blessed at this opportunity,” Ffrench said. “I know there has been a great players who played in the game in the past and I’m excited to put my name in there as a stamp as well. “This will be my first time visiting Hawaii so I’m excited about that as well. I know it’s going to be a breath taking experience for me.” A big part of the Polynesian Bowl is the opportunity for the players to learn a new culture and it’s something Ffrench said he’s looking forward to as well. “Yeh for sure, we talked about that,” Ffrench said. “I’m definitely looking forward to that part of and I can’t wait. “I’ve watched the game the last few years and really enjoyed it. It’s what got me interested, just seeing some of the great players that have played in so I’m excited to be a part of that.” The Polynesian Bowl has become one of the premier high school all-star games in the nation. The celebration of culture and football is what makes the game unique. The 2025 Polynesian Bowl will be televised live on the NFL Network. “The Polynesian Bowl has become the hottest high school football all-star invitation,” said 4x Super Bowl Champion and Polynesian Football Hall of Fame Chairman Jesse Sapolu. “Jaime will have an experience of a lifetime.” On the recruiting front, French was a one time commitment to Alabama but backed off in mid-January following Nick Saban’s retirement. “I haven’t set up any of my official visits yet but I have a lot of unofficial trips locked in right now,” Ffrench said. “I’m going to visit LSU March 9, Ohio State March 30) Texas April 6 and Tennessee April 8. I’ll most likely visit Florida State on March 23 as well. “I’m still figuring out my official trips but I do plan to make a summer decision. Once I take my unofficial trips, I’ll decide on the official trips and then be ready to make a commitment before my senior year.” Since his de-commitment, there has been a lot of buzz for Florida State and Ohio State and Miami and USC are heavily involved as well in addition to the aforementioned schools he's set to visit in March and April.",

    "text": "A través de su cuenta de X, el presidente Gustavo Petro compartió varios mensajes sobre el choque que generó la ministra del Trabajo, Gloria Inés Ramírez, al señalar que la empresa de atún Van Camp’s tendría colaboradores bajo supuestas malas condiciones laborales. Luego de que la compañía señalara que eso no es cierto, Petro defendió la postura de Ramírez y dijo que “tienen trabajadoras tercerizadas desde hace 20 años”. En uno de sus trinos compartió una denuncia contra Seatech Internacional, fabricante de la marca Van Camp’s, en la que se habla de una “actitud férreamente antisindical” de la empresa y de los supuestos contratos a través de bolsas de empleo, con los que trabajarían miles de empleados por 15, 16 y hasta 20 años. Lea también: Tras orden de la Contraloría, Petro suspendió al director de Gestión del Riesgo En otra publicación, el mandatario se refirió al testimonio de dos empleadas que denunciaron maltratos como descuentos del salario por el tiempo que requieren para ir al baño. “Mujeres trabajadoras y negras. Por eso las explotan, por eso no las escuchaban. Toda la fuerza del gobierno respaldándolas. Estamos con ustedes”, dijo. Más temprano, el presidente ya había compartido uno de los videos de las trabajadoras, en el cual una de ellas denuncia que la empresa las está “obligando a usar paños desechables porque nos descuentan del día las idas al baño; eso no está produciendo, a futuro, enfermedades”. No se pierda: Gobernador electo de Antioquia insiste en referendo de autonomía para departamentos Según la empresa productora de Van Camp’s, las declaraciones de la ministra no son ciertas y atentan contra los más de 35 años de trayectoria de la compañía, por lo que se defenderán en instancias legales. Sin embargo, el Ministerio del Trabajo asegura que ha hecho dos visitas a Seatech International Inc, en la sede de Cartagena, y que investiga 26 hallazgos por presuntas violaciones laborales. En un comunicado publicado este jueves, la cartera señala que se investigan las querellas de las trabajadoras por un “descuento ilegal en salarios por control del tiempo en las necesidades fisiológicas”. Además, explica que la compañía en cuestión enfrenta 10 procesos activos, uno de ellos por presuntamente “realizar retenciones o descuentos a los salarios de los trabajadores sin autorización”. Por último, advierte que el ministerio adelantó ocho procesos sancionatorios que ascienden a más de $3.500 millones, tres directamente contra Seatech Internacional y los cinco restantes a la empresa temporal con la cual la compañía terceriza algunos servicios, Tiempo Servicios S.A.S. 👁‍🗨 Conozca cómo votan los senadores y representantes a la Cámara en ‘Congreso a la mano’. 👉 Lea más sobre el Congreso, el gobierno Petro y otras noticias del mundo político.",
