Di fronte a una situazione di apparente stasi, e mancanza delle necessarie tutele, i lavoratori metalmeccanici sono scesi in piazza questa mattina, dando forza a un nuovo sciopero nazionale, il secondo dall’inizio dell’anno solare, e il terzo dallo scorso dicembre per urlare il proprio malcontento nei confronti di Federmeccanica e Assistal, rivendicando risposte concrete per quanto concerne l’adeguamento dei salari, l’aggiornamento dei provvedimenti normativi rispetto alle trasformazioni del settore e una maggiore sicurezza per la salute dei lavoratori.\n56mila quelli che hanno aderito allo sciopero in regione, oltre 300 quelli scesi in piazza a Udine.",

    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Bill Astle says it has been a nightmare after a video went viral that appeared to show him not scanning items while checking out at Walmart. (Source: KMOV) By Jon Kipper and Jordan Gartner Published: Jun. 13, 2024 at 4:35 PM EDT | Updated: 38 minutes ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nST. LOUIS ( KMOV /Gray News) - Social media can be a great place to connect with people and keep up with the latest headlines, but a Missouri man says a shared video has made his life a nightmare for the last week.\nBill Astle has been the subject of a now-viral video that showed him appearing not to scan any of his items while checking out at an area Walmart.\n“This man is really just stealing everything,” a woman can be heard saying in the video. “So open about it, look at the screen, nothing is ringing up.”\nBut Astle says he was just doing his job.\n“I’m not a thief. I’m being pictured and painted as a thief on the internet,” Astle said.\nAccording to Astle, he works for Spark, Walmart’s delivery service. When shopping, he says he scans the items from his phone as he grabs them.\n“Everything is done off the phone, so when we get to the register, we’re not actually scanning a single item,” he said.\nAstle says when fellow team members get to the register, they just scan their phone into the self-checkout and bag the items.\nAnd yet when he did this last month, he was unwittingly being filmed.\n“Millions and millions of views,” Astle said.\nThe video has since been viewed over 16 million times with many viewers calling Astle a shoplifter and for police to arrest him.\n“I’ve had customers say, ‘Hey, didn’t I see you on the internet? Didn’t you steal items?’ And then I have to explain to people what I was doing,” he said.\nAstle says he has receipts that show he was working at Walmart that day as he works to clear his name and get his life back to normal.\nAccording to Astle, there was an item he paid for that day personally before the video ended and it was Mother’s Day flowers for his wife.\n“They would have seen when I got done with the Spark delivery order, I scanned two dozen roses and used my debit card to pay for them,” Astle said.\nAstle urged social media users to not post videos of strangers, especially if they are not certain of what’s going on.\nCopyright 2024 KMOV via Gray Media Group, Inc.
