    "text": "Nextracker launches new AI and robotics business\nThe launch of Nextracker’s new AI and robotics business initiative is anchored by the appointment of its first chief AI and robotics officer and a series of strategic technology acquisitions.\nNextracker, a California-based solar technology platform provider, has announced the launch of a new AI and robotics business initiative, anchored by the appointment of its first chief AI and robotics officer and a series of strategic technology acquisitions.\nOver the past four quarters, the company has invested over USD 40 million to acquire three AI and robotics technologies. These acquisitions strengthen Nextracker’s end-to-end digital platform and enhance solar power plant deployment, quality, reliability, and long-term return on investment (ROI) for asset owners, the company said in a media release.\nNextracker has appointed Dr. Francesco Borrelli as chief AI and robotics officer, a newly created executive role focused on advancing the company’s global AI and robotics strategy. In his new role, he will lead the integration of AI, machine learning, and advanced robotics into Nextracker’s products and solutions to support global scalability and long-term innovation.\n“With millions of sensors and control nodes already deployed over approximately 100 GW of operating systems in 40 countries, Nextracker has a unique opportunity to harness AI and robotics at scale,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Dr. Borelli brings the vision and expertise to lead this evolution, allowing us to deliver deeper insights, timely and incisive actions, and greater customer ROI across our global technology platform.”\n“Scaling solar to meet global energy demand requires a new level of autonomy in how we build and operate power plants,” said Dr. Borrelli. “I’m excited to join Nextracker in this role and help lead the integration of AI and robotics—turning field data into real-time action that drives solar plant performance, reduces risk, and accelerates deployment.”\nAs a key component of its digital and robotics technology platform, Nextracker acquired OnSight Technology, a pioneer in autonomous robotic inspection and fire detection systems for solar power plants, the media release said.\nNextracker also announced two previously undisclosed complementary acquisitions: SenseHawk IP (August 2024), which enables the creation of high-resolution 3D as-built maps of solar project sites using AI-enabled drone-captured imagery; and Amir Robotics (March 2025), a developer of a lightweight, water-free robotic cleaning technology designed for daily operation at large-scale solar sites.\nEvertiq Expo events.The next edition is scheduled for on September 4, 2025, in\nGothenburg. These gatherings provide an excellent opportunity to meet key industry players and attend insightful talks by leading experts.

    "title": "Teen serial ‘swatter’ vowed to commit mass shooting in ‘name of Satan,’ targeted mosques, FBI offices, the Pentagon: Police",
    "text": "A 17-year-old from California who allegedly made threatening phone calls vowing to shoot up a mosque, kill members of the FBI and target victims ranging from students on high school and college campuses to the Pentagon, has been arrested after he was extradited to Florida. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by Law&Crime Thursday, prosecutors say Alan Filion’s computer turned up a long list of disturbing searches including the lengthy entry: “Execute them. Kill them. Behead them. Roadhouse kick them into the concrete. Slam dunk them into the trashcan. Crucify them. Curb stomp them. Report them to the IRS. Twist their heads off. Crush their heads in the trash compactor. Liquefy them in a vat of avid. Exterminate them in the execution chamber. Stomp their skulls with steel toed boots…” He also allegedly looked up “how many jews are in the US,” “satanic rituals” and “criminal mastermind swatting.” His arrest was first announced in a statement from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office. Police said officers received a call last May from a male who said he was going inside the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque in Sanford, Florida, to conduct a mass shooting. “The caller made references to Satanism and stated he had handgun and explosive devices. He then began playing audio of gunfire in the background. In response to the call, approximately 30 law enforcement officers respond to the MasjidAl Hayy Mosque. After arriving on the scene and finding no shooter and the mosque staff safe, it was determined to be a swatting incident,” police said. Court records reviewed by Law&Crime allege Filion made calls far and wide and bragged about being paid for his criminal hoaxes. He made swatting calls in October 2022 to a police department and high school in Skagit County, Washington. On at least five occasions, he threatened to bomb, shoot or otherwise wreak havoc. Police say Filion tried to pin the call on another student. He allegedly bragged online about owning body armor and pipe bombs that he would use as grenades and vowed to kill homosexuals and their “enablers.” He also posted records of threats made to emergency services in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Houston, Maryland and Iowa. Most were high schools, and at least one was a nongovernmental organization in Bethesda, Maryland, that researches extremism. The FBI said Filion would encourage people to place “orders” with him to make the dangerous calls. On Telegram and other social media spaces, police say he often used handles, gamer tags or screen names invoking the lore of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings making their work piecing the trail back to Filion together easier. He will be back in court in Florida on March 19. Whether he will be charged in other venues where he swatted victims is open-ended for now. Each jurisdiction can prosecute him if they wish. Filion is being held without bail. His attorney did not immediately return a request for comment to Law&Crime Thursday. He is facing four charges in Florida including false report concerning the planting of a bomb or explosive, unlawful use of a two-way communication device while facilitating or furthering an act of terrorism; false report to law enforcement concerning the commission of a capital felony while facilitating or furthering an act of terrorism; and false report to law enforcement causing public safety agency response (Swatting) while facilitating or furthering an act of terrorism.

    "text": "Great Weather to Ring in the New Year! Seattle - The stage is set at the Space Needle for the big drone and fireworks display tonight. Weather is looking dry for New Year's Eve celebrations with temperatures in the low 40's around midnight. There is some fog developing around Western Washington, mainly central Kitsap Peninsula southwardthrough Pierce, Mason, Thurston and Lewis Counties. Visibilities around Seattle should stay well enough to see the show tonight. We are starting off the new year dry tomorrow. Perfect weather for the Winter Classic at T-Mobile Park. By Tuesday, we are looking at increasing rain chances in the lowlands, and mountain snow with levels around 3200'-2700'. The first full week of the new year looks cooler, with temperatures trending cooler each day through next weekend. Early indications show the best chance for rain on Friday and Saturday, with the potential for windy conditions too. Some forecast models are hinting at snow levels coming way down to near 500' by next Sunday! Stay tuned to the forecast as we get closer to the end of next week.",
