    "title": "Former Spelman student denounces the institution, HBCU alumni react",
    "text": "Within the HBCU community, a notable trend has emerged where current and former students are denouncing organizations due to religious beliefs. Recently, [a video from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltlPHD0s7p0&ab_channel=AngeliseIsHerName) four months ago has surfaced featuring a [former Spelman student](https://clutchpoints.com/ludacris-daughter-karma-bridges-graduates-from-hbcu-spelman-college) denouncing the institution. Angelise Prince, who attended Spelman from 2012-2016, released a 53-minute video in January entitled “Renouncing Spelman College | Demonic Covenants Made At Spelman College”. In the video, she reveals her religious beliefs and mentions being divinely instructed to speak out against Spelman College, claiming they formed a pact with a ‘demonic entity.' “During this time, [God has] really been sharing with me a lot of things and uncovering a lot of things in my life that are just not okay with Him. One of the things that has come up is Spelman College and the covenant that I made with the demon that is operating behind Spelman College. The demonic covenants that are there, all of the rituals, and all the things that are going on.” Later in the video, she mentions that students who attended an HBCU may want to consider ending any connections that don't align with Christ. After HBCU Twitter/X users [discovered the video](https://clutchpoints.com/hbcu), numerous individuals took the initiative to express their disapproval. The video garnered a rapid increase in views, reaching 26,000 views with 669 comments, predominantly criticizing its content and the rationale behind it. “Thee Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. himself laid in state at the chapel on Spelman's campus, but this cucumber brain is “denouncing” it because God told her a demon is operating behind Spelman? Yall gotta seek professional help,” @dijadontneedya posted. @teemo2006 posted, “Not that girl saying she’s renouncing Spelman College in the name of Jesus. Um, our motto is literally “our whole school for Christ.” Literally founded on the basis of religion! And are you renouncing your degree so you won’t list it when applying for jobs ma’am???” “Not that girl got on the video renouncing Spelman when she had a 2.4 let’s wrap this up ! And don’t get me wrong who truly cares about your college gpa, graduating is what matters. But please,” posted @CagedBirdd_. “Oh that girl was fr ab denouncing spelman? I’m cryin so where she get her degree from? She still got student loans? Like I’m confused bc I’m not watching ts,” posted @itsmajyswrld. @TinyPrincess_D had a direct response to a portion of the video where Prince “Are you a Christian that still is a part of a sorority or fraternity? Are you a Christian that celebrates demonic rainbows and unicorns? And Halloween, do you celebrate Halloween? Do you celebrate Easter? Meaning like getting into all the Easter bunny and the Easter egg hunts and all that kind of stuff, which is pagan. And, the tooth fairy and do you let your kids have like imaginary friends? Like all of those things, like I want you to check what kind of Christian you are because all those things that I just named, they, they do have demonic ties to them.” @TinyPrincess_D responded to what was said in the video by posting, “There is a very distinct purpose for the rainbow. That said, Spelman College needs to REVOKE her degree, and she should not be allowed to use Spelman on her resume.",

    "title": "Celsius Network gets green light for Bitcoin mining",
    "text": "Cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network has received the green light to make a strategic shift into [bitcoin mining](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-mine-bitcoin/), following approval from a [U.S.](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-congress-has-had-a-very-dramatic-year/) bankruptcy judge. The decision represents a significant pivot for the company, which had originally aimed to earn fees from validating crypto transactions but had to alter its course after encountering regulatory obstacles. Here’s a closer look at Celsius Network’s bold move into the world of bitcoin mining. A Judge’s Approval for a New Direction In a recent ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan granted Celsius Network the ability to deviate from its previously approved bankruptcy plan. This decision came after the company faced challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Glenn determined that the new restructuring would not negatively impact creditors or customers, thus allowing Celsius Network to proceed with its bitcoin mining venture. Celsius Network’s journey to bitcoin mining began when it filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022. This move was in line with several other crypto lenders who faced financial difficulties amidst the rapid growth of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, Celsius had grand plans to generate revenue by validating crypto transactions and exploring new business avenues. However, the SEC’s rejection of this plan prompted a strategic shift. The change in direction also meant that the lender would no longer work with certain outside bidders who were initially chosen to oversee the new company. Instead, the responsibility for running the creditor-owned mining business fell squarely on the shoulders of mining company US Bitcoin Corp. Celsius’ Fahrenheit Consortium US Bitcoin Corp, founded by Hut 8’s Asher Genoot, was originally part of a consortium of bidders known as “Fahrenheit.” This consortium also included Arrington Capital and was intended to manage Celsius Network alongside other companies. However, with the pivot to bitcoin mining, Celsius parted ways with these bidders, leaving US Bitcoin Corp as the primary manager. While the shift in focus was deemed significant by some creditors and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, Judge Glenn ultimately approved the deal without calling for a new vote by creditors. Despite initial concerns that this change was not in line with what creditors had originally voted on, Celsius Network was granted the opportunity to move forward with its bitcoin mining plans. Celsius Network now looks ahead to emerging from bankruptcy in early 2024. The company’s scaled-back bankruptcy plan not only allows for the pursuit of bitcoin mining but also frees up $225 million in cryptocurrency assets. These assets were initially intended to fund new business lines that were rejected by the SEC. Benefits for Customers As a result of this strategic pivot, more cryptocurrency assets from Celsius will be returned to customers. Additionally, customers will receive equity shares in the new bitcoin mining venture. This move represents a unique approach to bankruptcy restructuring, one that aims to ensure that creditors and customers are not left in a worse position. Celsius Network’s foray into bitcoin mining is a testament to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory challenges continue to shape the sector, companies are finding innovative ways to adapt and thrive. This bold move by Celsius Network signals its determination to explore new opportunities in the world of digital assets.",

    "text": "Newswise — MIAMI, FLORIDA (EMBARGOED UNTIL APRIL 4, 2024, at 6:30 pm EDT) – Annual prostate cancer cases worldwide are projected to double by the year 2040, and annual deaths are projected to increase by 85% to almost 700,000 over the same timeframe – mainly among men in low- and middle-income countries. A commissioned\nreport published online in The Lancet on April 4 highlights the future landscape of prostate cancer and seeks to guide cancer experts worldwide on how to manage the massive influx of prostate cancer patients projected over the next two decades. Brandon Mahal, M.D., radiation oncologist and translational epidemiologist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine was a member of a prestigious group of international experts commissioned to write the collaborative article.\n“Unlike a typical study, which describes a single or set of experiments, commissioned pieces involve The Lancet editors working with academic partners to address the most pressing issues in science, medicine and global health,” Mahal explained.\nHe said the report was conceived back in 2020, when the journal’s editors sought advice from a select group of 40 cancer experts to highlight the increasing burden of prostate cancer, with global cases projected to more than double by 2040. “Specifically, they wanted our collective, international perspective on this looming global burden,” he said. “They asked us to report the extent of the problem, identify the most at-risk populations and explain how best to address the expected surge.”\nBesides outlining the scope of the problem – worldwide cases are expected to explode from 1.4 million now to 2.9 million in just 16 years – The Lancet report highlights both ethnic and geographic disparities in the overall burden of prostate cancer and emphasizes the need for more research into the factors driving these differences.\nThat’s an area right in Mahal’s wheelhouse. As a translational epidemiologist, he studies differences in disease risk among populations. “Men with West African ancestry, for example, are more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer,” he said.\nAdditionally, he and his Sylvester research colleagues have published studies showing that racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer prevalence cannot be explained by genetic differences alone.\nIn 2023, Mahal and his team published a\npaper showing that men of African ancestry were less likely than their European counterparts to get comprehensive genetic profiles of their tumors early in treatment. Genetic profiling helps physicians develop personalized treatment plans that have been proven more effective in treating prostate cancer. Patients without this initial profiling often receive substandard care.\nExpanding Community Outreach\nThe authors noted that one of the best ways to improve prostate cancer outcomes is to expand screening among high-risk populations so that the disease can be diagnosed at earlier stages, when treatment is typically most effective.\nAt Sylvester, Mahal works with a team dedicated to precision community outreach. “We have focused our efforts in neighborhoods where we know there’s a higher risk of developing prostate cancer,” he explained, “and we use our mobile vehicles to bring the screenings right to these residents.”\nThe mobile vans, dubbed\nSylvester’s Game Changers, enable Mahal and colleagues to target high-risk people by conducting the screenings at key community sites, including near workplaces, stores and libraries, and at health fairs and other events. The vans are staffed by professionals who speak English, Spanish and Creole to ensure they can communicate with people in their native languages.\nNot surprisingly, The Lancet report identifies mobile vans as a key strategy for providing earlier diagnoses in high-risk populations.\nOther Takeaways\nOther key recommendations from The Lancet report include:\n- Integrating the power of artificial intelligence for interpretation of scans and biopsy samples to improve early diagnosis.\n- Focusing more broadly on men’s health beyond prostate cancer.\n- Capitalizing on the global availability of smartphones in outreach efforts, as well as using social and traditional media to promote education.\n- Making sure affordable therapies for advanced prostate cancer are available where needed most.\n- Addressing the shortage of specialist surgeons and radiotherapy equipment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n- The Lancet Commission on prostate cancer argues that the ‘informed choice’ program for prostate cancer screening with PSA testing, which is common in high-income countries, may lead to over-testing and unnecessary treatment in older men, and under-testing in high-risk younger men. The authors advocate instead for early-detection programs for those at high risk.\n- The Commission also calls for urgent implementation of programs to raise awareness of prostate cancer and for improvements in early diagnosis and treatment in LMICs – where most men present with late-stage disease.\n- More research involving men of different ethnicities, especially those of West African descent, is needed, as current knowledge of prostate cancer biology is largely based on studies of white men.\nUnified Message\nAlthough The Lancet report delivers a sobering message that lifestyle or public health interventions will be insufficient to stem the expected tsunami of prostate cancer cases – and that minority populations and those in LMICs will bear the brunt of this burden – Mahal remains optimistic about his involvement with the project.\n“This report creates a unified message for all so we can be best equipped to handle this surge in prostate cancer cases,” he said. “Whether it’s different medical systems, national or international guidelines, institutions or community practices, we took great pride in our work and believe it can be a reference document for where to focus our efforts moving forward.”\nRead more about this important research on the\nInventUm Blog and follow @SylvesterCancer on X for the latest news on its research and care.\n# # #\nArticle title:\nThe Lancet Commission on Prostate Cancer: Planning for the Surge in Cases\nAuthors: The complete list of authors is included in the paper.\nDOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)00651-2\nDisclosures: The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest.\nFunding: No specific funding for this report.\n# # #\nMEDIA CONTACT\n[Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)\nCITATIONS\nThe Lancet, April 4, 2024",

    "text": "<p>Anand Madhukar and Ananya Mohan</p>.<p>The discourse around climate change has intensified over the past few decades as its worsening impacts become more evident through extreme weather events and record-breaking temperatures. This global phenomenon primarily stems from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Human activities release more CO2 into the atmosphere than natural processes can remove, altering the composition of the atmosphere and driving global warming and climate change.</p>.<p>To mitigate this, we must reduce CO2 concentration by either lowering emissions or capturing and storing them. Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) is a key technology that captures CO2 from industrial emission sources before it enters the atmosphere, helping to decarbonise sectors such as power generation, cement production, and steel manufacturing.</p>.<p>CCUS technologies fall into three main categories: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. The post-combustion method captures CO2 after burning fossil fuels, separating it from other gases. Pre-combustion captures CO2 during the gasification of fuel, while in the oxy-fuel combustion process, fuel is burnt in oxygen instead of air, producing CO2 and water vapours, simplifying CO2 capture. Once captured, CO2 can either be utilised or stored. For example, the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process involved injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs to help extract more oil while storing the CO2 underground.</p>.A giant carbon dump gives glimpse into net-zero future.<p>Captured CO2 can also be transformed into synthetic fuels like methane or methanol, reducing reliance on fossil fuels or used in building materials and accelerating algae production for biofuels. If there are barriers to CO2 utilisation, it can be stored in geological formations by injecting it deep into underground rock formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers, where it can stay for thousands of years. CO2 can be injected deep into the ocean, where high pressures prevent it from escaping.</p>.<p>CCUS continues to evolve, with innovations and emerging technologies, such as direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), offering future solutions for reducing atmospheric CO2. DAC removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere, addressing historical emissions, while BECCS aims to deliver negative emissions by absorbing more CO2 than is emitted.</p>.<p>Despite its promise, CCUS faces many challenges limiting its large-scale adoption. The high costs of installation and operation are a significant barrier, as the infrastructure required for CCUS, such as capture equipment and transport pipelines, is expensive. Technical challenges also hinder CCUS adoption. Retrofitting existing industrial facilities with carbon capture technologies is complex.</p>.<p>Additionally, a comprehensive regulatory framework and economic incentives are needed to encourage CCUS deployment. Without policies like carbon pricing or clear regulations on long-term CO2 storage liability, industries can have little motivation to invest in the technology. Public awareness is another issue, and many are concerned about the safety and environmental risks of CO2 storage. Moreover, CCUS competes with the growing renewable energy sector, where solar and wind are becoming more cost-effective.</p>.<p>However, while renewables are essential for decarbonising power generation, CCUS remains vital for hard-to-abate sectors like steel and cement. For countries committed to net zero goals, CCUS can significantly reduce carbon footprints and support sustainable development. In this context, India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) has been playing a crucial role in advancing CCUS technologies.</p>.<p>DST’s Climate, Energy, and Sustainable Technology (CEST) division has been promoting research and development by funding projects to improve CCUS methods. DST aims to make CCUS technologies more efficient and cost-effective by supporting innovations in materials and processes.</p>.<p>The department also fosters international collaborations, partnering with other countries through initiatives such as Mission Innovation. These partnerships can help India access global expertise and financial resources for CCUS technology development. Recently, the foundation stone of the CO2 to Methanol Pilot Plant with an overall capacity of 1.4 tons per day (TPD) was laid to demonstrate the advancement of indigenous Carbon Capture and Utilisation cutting-edge technologies, marking a significant step towards India’s Panchamrit declaration presented during UNFCCC COP 26. In a nutshell, as the world seeks solutions to limit global warming, the CCUS technologies could be critical to a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p>.<p><em>(Anand Madhukar is assistant professor and programme coordinator (Climate Science & Policy) at TERI School of Advanced Studies, New Delhi.
