    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- It wasn't all that long ago that SEC basketball was an afterthought, with only a couple of entrants into the men's NCAA tournament.\nThose days are over -- a statement that was emphatically made when a record 14 SEC teams received bids to this year's tournament.\nAuburncoach Bruce Pearl, speaking ahead of his team's opening game Thursday, pointed to the investment level of each program into their respective rosters.\n\"The difference between the SEC this year and why there was such a great separation, top to bottom, there was commitment in the NIL and investing in our student-athletes,\" Pearl said Wednesday.\nAuburn is the No. 1 overall seed despite losing three of its past four games. The Tigers (28-5) face 16-seedAlabama State(20-15) on Thursday afternoon atKentucky's Rupp Arena.\nIt isn't just NIL; Pearl cited an improvement in coaching hires and staff resources that dates back to former SEC commissioner Mike Slive and has continued with current commissioner Greg Sankey.\nTennesseecoach Rick Barnes, who has spent the last 10 of his 38-year career in the SEC, praised the caliber of coaching across the conference.\n\"I haven't coached against any bad coaches,\" Barnes said. \"I really haven't. I've coached against coaches that haven't had the same resources along the way, and sometimes you can win some of the time like that, but not overall at the level that you want to be able to sustain it.\"\nBarnes recalled Sankey's first address at the SEC spring meetings, during which the commissioner delivered a \"harsh\" message. Every sport was trending upward except for basketball.\nBarnes pointed out that at the time, the SEC was among the worst in the country in non-conference scheduling.\n\"Everything that has happened in the 10 years has been a commitment from the top down,\" Barnes said. \"I think at one point in time, I think maybe athletic directors at one time felt like you couldn't be good in every sport.\"\nPearl pointed to one of the other Power Four conferences, and two programs in particular.\n\"Let's just say Louisville and Duke, for example, in the ACC,\" Pearls said. \"Those two programs have been consistently well supported. They got great history.\n\"So when it comes to the NIL, they're going to be invested. Not everybody in the ACC invested like those two schools.\"\nLouisville (27-7) is a No. 8 seed and faces 9-seed Creighton on Thursday in Lexington. If the Cardinals win, they will face the winner of Auburn-Alabama State.\nThe ACC program is making its first NCAA tournament appearance in nine years in coach Pat Kelsey's first season.\nThe SEC schools aren't the only major players at the Lexington regional site. Seventh-seededUCLA(22-10), led by veteran coach Mick Cronin, finished tied for fourth in the school's first season in the Big Ten.\nNever shy to speak his mind, Cronin said that the level of investment varies on a school-by-school approach. He also noted that the conversation is rooted in speculation.\n\"It's like some agent tells me somebody else offered you a million dollars,\" Cronin said. \"Well, he's probably lying. He's just trying to drive the price up.\n\"And nobody wants to admit what they spent on their team, right? Nobody wants to admit it. They want to act like they did a great job recruiting, OK? That's just how guys are in our business.\"\nThe current NIL model could see a massive upheaval, with revenue share between players and schools pending on the House vs. NCAA approval hearing scheduled for April 7. Whether or not NIL will still exist in the new era remains to be seen.\nBut in paraphrasing former UCLA coach John Wooden, Cronin noted that the schools that make investments, such as the SEC programs and others around the country, tend to reap the rewards.\n\"The guy with the best players usually wins, and the team with the most money has the chance to get the best players,\" Cronin said. \"They don't always do that. But that's just the era we are in.\"",

    "title": "Will the Northern Lights be visible in NC again tonight?",
    "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C. — Thursday night the Northern Lights were visible in the Piedmont-Triad and put on a beautiful display! The Northern Lights can be seen when energy from the sun moves toward Earth and interacts with our magnetic field. The result is the bright color you may see in pictures. Scientists tracked these bursts of energy from the such, known as Coronal Mass Ejections, and spotted a big one arriving Thursday evening -- what many of you saw and posted online! [The forecast](/article/weather/weather-impact/local-weather-forecast-wfmy-news-2/83-823493fc-d77c-4005-b165-39dedf2cb92c) was also great with clear skies also expected in the nights ahead. Can you spot them again tonight? Unfortunately, they are not likely to be visible once again this evening in the Carolinas. However, folks up north will still have a chance due to a higher planetary K index (Kp) remaining in place, which is a measurement of geomagnetic activity. Here's tonight's forecast for the Northern Lights: The forecast for Friday night from Space Weather experts at NOAA show the Northern Lights being viewable across northernmost United States, with low chances for the Mid-Atlantic. NOAA rates these solar storms on what's known as a \"Kp scale\" from 0-9. The higher the Kp index means the lights will be brighter and move further from the poles. This past May, the scale was at a 9! This made for beautiful photos in NC. Last night was just above an 8 on the scale, which still was capturable on cameras and phones. Today, the Kp index is between a 4-5 which will likely not be give even the dark parts of the Piedmont a chance. This should come as no surprise, but it's hard to see the Northern Lights in the South. The two chances we've had this year are extraordinary exceptions! Can you predict them? The Northern Lights are even harder to predict than weather. According to NOAA, it's possible to predict geomagnetic activity and aurora a day or so in advance by detecting solar coronal holes in the sun and Coronal Mass Ejections and their departure from the sun / possible impact on Earth. It's easier to forecast the aurora within a short time frame from measuring solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field upstream of the Earth. While NC has has a few opportunities to see them this year, they are still very rare. Still, they do happen from time to time. We'll keep you posted if any more chances arise!",

    "text": "By Xie Yu and Yantoultra Ngui\nHONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A growing number of wealth managers in Asia are setting up offices in Dubai, capitalising on warming diplomatic ties between China and the Middle East and betting on a surge in demand from clients for geographical diversification.\nDubai, a major financial hub in the Gulf region, is emerging as a preferred wealth hub for many entrepreneurs and rich families in Asia, mainly China, as they look to take advantage of favourable policies and expand their businesses, wealth managers said.\nNoah Holdings, one of China's top wealth managers overseeing round $23 billion in client assets, for example, is expecting to get a business license in Dubai by the end of this year, said Qing Pan, its chief financial officer.\nThe Dubai office will serve Chinese entrepreneurs who are setting up their businesses in that market, he said.\n\"Noah's strategy has been following the growth of clients' wealth. That's why we will have to be there and take care of the wealth generated locally,\" Pan said, adding that the firm plans to send some staff from China first and recruit locally later.\n\"Many Chinese entrepreneurs are looking for new markets and diversifying their supply chains, and many are excited by the opportunities offered by the Middle East.\"\nThe Middle East has grown increasingly important to Beijing as its ties with Washington have soured amid disagreements on a range of issues from trade and technology to human rights and Taiwan.\nA post-COVID economic rebound, neutral political stance, ease of doing business, convenient time zones, and tax free status have all contributed to the Middle East attracting droves of wealthy individuals in recent years.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) has in the recent past introduced incentives such as the 'golden visa' system. Dubai launched a 'family wealth center' last year to help wealthy individuals and businesses deal with cultural issues and governance.\nAs a result, western wealth managers including Swiss private bank Lombard Odier are looking to expand their business presence in the region to tap into the influx of expatriates and growing population of rich individuals.\nINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES\nIn Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore have long been the most preferred offshore wealth hubs for rich individuals. But some clients are now looking to diversify into other markets and get exposure to new investment opportunities, said wealth managers.\nThe global number of high net worth individuals (HNWI) fell 3.3% to 21.7 million in 2022, but the Middle East's HNWI population increased 2.8% in the same year, according to Capgemini's 2023 wealth report.\nThe UAE saw the highest net inflow of millionaires in the world in 2022, and the private wealth hub was estimated to have received a net inflow of another 4,500 in 2023, according to data from Dubai-based wealth and immigration adviser Henley & Partners.\nBetting on the trend, Singapore-based multi-family office Farro Capital set up an office in Dubai last month. Patrick Tsang, chairman of Hong Kong-based single family office Tsang Group, said the firm was planning to launch new offices in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia's Riyadh this year after its Dubai foray in 2022.\nHong Kong-based Landmark Family Office is also planning to set up an office in Dubai in the coming months. Landmark's founder and CEO Cameron Harvey said the firm's Dubai office would be used to help clients based in China, Southeast Asia, and Australia find investment opportunities in the Middle East.\nA recent survey of 76 Asia Pacific-based single and multi-family offices, done by Campden Wealth and Raffles Family Office, found average asset allocation to the Middle East region at only 1%, with 7% of the respondents planning to increase that.\n\"We live in very interesting times where geopolitics have become more critical to families than ever before,\" said Manish Tibrewal, co-founder of Singapore's Farro Capital, adding Dubai's push to regulate virtual assets, and the golden visa system, among others, have enhanced its appeal.\n(Reporting by Xie Yu in Hong Kong and Yantoultra Ngui in Singapore; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Muralikumar Anantharaman)",
