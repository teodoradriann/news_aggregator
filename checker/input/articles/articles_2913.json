    "text": "Epic Waves Hit Southern California Coast To Wipe Out 2023 The Southern California coast is dealing with dangerous high surf, life-threatening rip currents, and flooding that’s expected to ride into the last weekend of 2023. Ventura County, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Palos Verdes face the most extreme conditions on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. All of those areas, plus Catalina Island, the Malibu coast, and other L.A. County beaches are under a high surf and coastal flood warning until 10 p.m. Saturday. Ventura County Very large swell is impacting our coast. If you are in a position to safely see any coastal flooding we would appreciate any reports, photos, or video. This swell is at Ventura pier and ~20'.— NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) [#CAwx] [pic.twitter.com/0umT8Af86V] [December 28, 2023] The larger waves are expected to be between 5 and 15 feet with sets up to 20 feet, as seen at the Ventura pier. The surf can be dangerous, especially near the water lines. Everyone should stay off of beaches, piers, and other infrastructure near the water because of the life-threatening conditions. - Listen: Big surf, SoCal housing and more - It's like 'dating the city' - By thinking about neighbors Several areas have already flooded, and the Ventura County Fire Department said on social media that eight people were taken to local hospitals after being injured by a large surge wave that flooded the shoreline near Seaward Avenue and Pierpont Boulevard. The fire department’s heavy equipment operators have been helping the Public Works Department clear flooded areas around San Pedro Street. Multiple people were rescued, according to the fire department. Additionally, each morning will bring residual high tides up to 6.5 feet, which increases the risk of coastal flooding. Heavy traffic has also been reported on the northbound 101 through the city of Ventura Thursday afternoon. Los Angeles County The larger waves are expected to be between 7 and 12 feet, with sets up to 20 feet likely around Point Conception, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Palos Verdes. Officials are encouraging people to stay out of the water, or at least swim and surf near occupied lifeguard towers. Flooding is also likely, especially in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas like parking lots, beaches, and walkways around high tide. As in Ventura County, each morning will bring residual high tides up to 6.5 feet, which will increase the risk of coastal flooding. The National Weather Service said rock jetties can be deadly in these conditions, so steer clear. However, significant damage to roads and infrastructure is not expected. Officials are reminding people to protect any flood-prone property, and never drive through water if you don’t know how deep it is. Orange County The Orange County coast is under a high surf and coastal flood warning until 2 a.m. Monday. The larger waves are expected to be between 6 to 10 feet with sets up to 12 feet in the northern areas. While surfers were taking advantage of the conditions in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach Thursday morning, officials are warning inexperienced swimmers to stay out of the water. Flooding is expected, especially in parks and roads around Seal Beach, Sunset Beach, and Newport Beach. The National Weather Service is also expecting some isolated road closures, so if you need to drive somewhere, give yourself extra time. Again, do not drive around barricades or through water if you don’t know how deep it is. - Allowable rent hikes depend on where you live, and in what type of building.

    "text": "Bali is not known for its lack of crowds.\nThe dream is still alive, though. Empty, perfect waves breaking in front of desolate beaches, the smell of Chempaka incense drifting on a light offshore breeze. It’s still possible… just very, very rare. But if you like warm water reef breaks (you do), it’s tough to beat Bali for a place to start.\n“Bali, the island of gods,”\nNic von Rupp wrote. “Such an amazing place. If you’re a surfer, it’s the perfect spot to base yourself off and chase swells in Indonesia. However, you’ll have to deal with the crowds.”\nLike most things, however, there’s a workaround. Nic’s crowd workaround is a friend named Rodrigo. Rodrigo lives there and knows all the nooks and crannies that the casual surf tourist might not. He also happens to have a Jet Ski to aid in the search for empty lineups.\n“That’s what we did in this episode,” Nic continued. “We got to this spot only to find some really nice walls in the morning with no one out. Swell picked up during the day and we went for a second session and to our surprise it was even better: barrels!”",

    "text": "Dopo la pioggia dei giorni scorsi torna il sole e promette un fine settimana di bel tempo, soprattutto al Centro-Sud. E' l'inzio di una fase di alta pressione che dovrebbe inaugurare la prossima settimana. Lo indicano le previsioni del meteorologo Mattia Gussoni, del sito iLMeteo.it.\n \"Nelle prossime ore avremo prevalenza di sole\", si legge nella nota, mentre a Nord \"il cielo sarà più nuvoloso su Piemonte poi su Liguria, Valle d'Aosta e Lombardia occidentale; dal pomeriggio qualche addensamento non è escluso anche su Appennini, Alpi orientali ed Alta Toscana. Altrove il sole sarà dominante e le temperature massime saranno gradevoli: al Nord tra i 18°C e i 23°C, al Centro tra i 21°C e i 25°C, al Sud tra i 23°C e i 28°C\".\n Cielo sereno e sole sulla maggior parte delle regioni sono previsti anche per domenica 13 ottobre, \"salvo nubi medio-basse su Piemonte meridionale e Friuli Venezia Giulia, specie al mattino. Durante tutto il weekend non sono attese precipitazioni se non qualche piovasco sabato su Valle d'Aosta, Alto Piemonte, Alta Lombardia e Liguria\".\n Una situazione simile si annuncia anche per la prossima settimana, prosegue il meteorologo, con tempo \"piuttosto stabile e soleggiato quasi ovunque\". E' comuque atteso pe rlunedì \"un aumento della nuvolosità sul settentrione con la possibilità di isolata pioviggine, più probabile al Nord-Ovest\".\n In generale si profila sull'Italia un periodo di alta pressione, \"circondato a destra e sinistra da due zone cicloniche, una sulla Spagna ed una sulla Turchia\".\n Nel dettaglio: sabato 12: al Nord nuvoloso; al Centro soleggiato; al Sud soleggiato.\n domenica 13: al Nord nubi irregolari; al Centro via via più nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo.\n lunedì 14: al Nord piovaschi a ovest; al Centro poco nuvoloso; al Sud bel tempo.",

    "text": "O Papa Francisco deixou bem claro: casais [homossexuais](https://observador.pt/2023/12/18/padres-podem-abencoar-casais-do-mesmo-sexo-desde-que-nada-se-assemelhe-a-um-casamento/) podem ser abençoados, desde que não sigam rituais que se assemelham a um casamento. No entanto, não falou em que igrejas é que isso seria aplicado. E um arcebispo ucraniano já veio dizer que esse tipo de bênçãos não tem lugar na sua. [Padres podem abençoar casais do mesmo sexo desde que nada se assemelhe a um casamento] O chefe da Igreja Católica ucraniana, o arcebispo maior Sviatoslav Shevchuk, emitiu esta sexta-feira um [comunicado](https://docs.ugcc.ua/1713/) a reagir à decisão do Papa Francisco, dizendo que o tal vai contra as normas das Igrejas Católicas Orientais. E que é tudo uma questão de interpretação. “A declaração interpreta o significado pastoral das bênçãos na Igreja Latina, não nas Igrejas Católicas Orientais”, começou por dizer, acrescentando ainda que “não aborda questões de fé ou moral católicas” e que “não menciona os cristãos orientais”. “Assim, aplica-se exclusivamente à Igreja Latina e não tem força legal para os fiéis da Igreja Greco-Católica Ucraniana“, sublinhou. Depois, para clarificar o conceito de bênção, o arcebispo disse que “significa aprovação, permissão ou mesmo a ordem para um certo tipo de [ação](https://observador.pt/2023/09/06/bispos-catolicos-ucranianos-dizem-que-declaracoes-do-papa-sao-dolorosas-e-dificeis/), oração e práticas ascéticas, incluindo certos tipos de jejum e oração”. [Bispos católicos ucranianos dizem que declarações do Papa “são dolorosas e difíceis”] Desta forma, admite que “bênção de um sacerdote tem sempre uma dimensão evangelista e catequética” e que por isso mesmo “não pode de modo algum contradizer o ensinamento da Igreja Católica sobre a família como união fiel, indissolúvel e fecunda de amor entre um homem e uma mulher”. A prudência pastoral leva-nos a evitar gestos, expressões e conceitos ambíguos que possam distorcer ou deturpar a palavra de Deus e o ensinamento da Igreja”, rematou. Este comunicado foi emitido no mesmo dia em que Shevchuk admitiu estar “verdadeiramente grato ao Papa Francisco” pela “assistência ao povo ucraniano por meio de ajuda que é enviada ou por meio de apelos para acolher os refugiados”, disse numa entrevista ao jornal da Conferência Episcopal Italiana (CEI), [citado pelo Vatican News.](https://www.vaticannews.va/pt/igreja/news/2023-12/ucrania-shevchuk-grato-papa-francisco-nao-esquecer-nosso-povo.html) Na segunda-feira, o Papa Francisco terminou o suspense lançado em outubro sobre a possibilidade de vir a abençoar [casais](https://observador.pt/2023/10/02/papa-francisco-sugere-possibilidade-de-dar-bencaos-a-casais-do-mesmo-sexo-caso-nao-se-confundam-com-casamento-sacramental/) homossexuais e veio explicar em que moldes tal pode acontecer. [Papa Francisco sugere possibilidade de dar bênçãos a casais do mesmo sexo caso não se confundam com casamento sacramental] Desta forma, o pontífice disse que os casais podem receber a bênção desde que não pratiquem rituais semelhantes aos de um casamento, nomeadamente no que diz respeito ao vestuário escolhido e ao tipo de discurso. Precisamente para evitar qualquer forma de confusão ou escândalo, quando a oração de bênção é pedida por um casal em situação irregular, mesmo que seja expressa fora dos ritos prescritos pelos livros litúrgicos, esta bênção nunca deve ser dada em concomitância com as cerimónias de uma união civil, nem sequer em ligação com elas. Também não pode ser realizada com roupas, gestos ou palavras próprias de um casamento. O mesmo se aplica quando a bênção é pedida por um casal do mesmo sexo”, pode ler-se na [declaração Fiducia Supplicans.]",

    "title": "The 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In January 2024",
    "text": "It’s amazing how many fantastic films can pile up on Netflix NFLX in just a week. The new year started just five days ago, but already there are dozens of great new movies to choose from, including a few Netflix originals that need to be at the top of your watchlist if you’re a subscriber. This week’s selections include a real-life survival tale set on a glacier, a true-crime documentary about the corrupt world of cryptocurrency, and the directorial debut of Schitt’s Creek’s Daniel Levy—as well as dozens of other box-office-busting blockbusters and bona fide classics.\nSo let us not waste any more time. In the first section below, I’ll highlight the best of the best: the ten brand new movies you do not want to miss on Netflix. Then, at the bottom of the article, you’ll find a full list of every single new movie available in the past week. Hopefully you find the one (or two or three) movie(s) that will occupy your watchlist this week.\nThe 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In January 2024 Society of the Snow (2024) Directed by J.A. Bayona (in his first Spanish feature since 2007’s The Orphanage ), Society of the Snow brings to life the chilling true tale of survival following a catastrophic plane crash in the Andes Mountains back in 1972. This true-to-the-real-story film, starring Enzo Vogrincic Roldán, Matías Recalt, and Agustín Pardella, plunges viewers into the aftermath of a catastrophic plane crash, originally compiled by Pablo Vierci's book. Bayona, celebrated for his heartfelt narratives, doesn't avoid the stark truths that the crash survivors faced, including their morally ambiguous choices to endure. In the film, which closed out the 2023 Venice Film Festival, a narrative unfolds that honors our indomitable spirit against harsh trials, captured with stark honesty and profound compassion.\nMORE FOR YOU Why ‘Fargo’ Season 5 Doesn’t Feel Like ‘Fargo’ Anymore James Gunn Comments On Margot Robbie And The Future Of Harley Quinn Here’s What We Know About ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 As Parker Posey, Jason Isaacs And More Join Cast Mamma Mia! (2008) If you want to combat the frigid, icy season, what better way than diving into the sun-soaked, musical extravaganza of Mamma Mia! , which brings the joyous tunes of ABBA to life. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, this cheerful film stars Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in a lighthearted tale of self-discovery set amidst the scenic Greek islands. Amidst the beauty of a Grecian isle, this film unfurls as a jubilant soiree that coaxes you to belt out tunes, sway rhythmically, and warmly welcome life's twists. This film a journey that delights, amuses, and etches a joyful grin even on the most stubborn of faces.\nMalignant (2021) James Wan directed the suspenseful horror film Malignant , led by Annabelle Wallis, which weaves an intriguing and unexpected mystery. Starring Annabelle Wallis, the movie spins a story brimming with unforeseen turns and shadowy revelations. In contrast to the typical scares of horror flicks, \"Malignant\" thrives with its innovative narrative and chilling imagery that conjure an ambiance both eerily disturbing and strangely alluring. For those with a hunger for chilling and reflective horror tales, this film stands out as it demonstrates that the genre retains the power to astonish and captivate viewers in novel, thrilling ways.\nGood Grief (2024) Directed, scripted, and headlined by Dan Levy, Good Grief tenderly delves into the themes of mourning and finding oneself anew. Diverging from his comedic roots, Levy portrays Marc, a man reeling from the sudden death of his husband, Oliver (Luke Evans). Accompanied by his closest friends, Sophie (Ruth Negga) and Thomas (Himesh Patel), Marc embarks on a journey to Paris that unveils truths about love, friendship, and grief. Levy skillfully mixes laughs with true-to-life emotion, showing off his versatility as a creator and performer. The film delves into a deeply personal and somewhat melancholic tale that strikes a chord with those who've wrestled with the tangled threads of grief and self-discovery.\nThose Who Wish Me Dead (2021) In the gripping film Those Who Wish Me Dead , Taylor Sheridan directs Angelina Jolie as she embodies a fearless firefighter grappling with her most intense and intimate battle. The movie isn't just packed with thrills, but also explores the struggles of enduring, seeking forgiveness, and finding inner strength. Jolie's depiction of a character both fragile and tough captivates us, while the stark beauty of the wild backdrop contributes to the movie's unpolished and intense atmosphere. For those drawn to tales that touch the heart as much as they quicken the pulse, this is one not to be overlooked.\nJohn Wick (2014) In John Wick , Keanu Reeves takes the spotlight in a transformative action flick that reshapes the genre by weaving minimalist yet sophisticated combat with a heartfelt quest for retaliation. Keanu Reeves's embodiment of the central character is legendary, merging a composed exterior with dynamic fighting talents. Helmed by Chad Stahelski, the movie's original dance of combat and visionary camera work elevate each duel to a breathtaking visual poem. It's more than a standard action film, as this cinematic accomplishment captivates with its visually striking choreography and emotionally impactful narrative.\nBitconned (2024) Directed by Bryan Storkel, the enthralling film Bitconned plunges into the murky depths of cryptocurrency scams. The documentary spotlights the rise and fall of Centra Tech, a blockchain enterprise built on trickery and broken promises. In his documentary, Storkel deftly constructs a narrative that includes candid conversations with co-founder Ray Trapani, team members, swindled individuals, and the detectives who uncovered their fraudulence—spinning a riveting tale of ambition gone awry in the murky world of business ventures. This documentary is a cautionary tale about the allure and dangers of unregulated financial markets, offering a fascinating glimpse into one of the most notorious scams of the digital age.\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) Directed by Milos Forman, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest emerges as a landmark in the annals of cinema. Jack Nicholson delivers an unforgettable performance as Randle McMurphy, a rebellious spirit challenging the oppressive rules of a mental institution. The movie skillfully mixes a serious storyline with touches of dark humor and sharp observations on society, creating an experience that makes you think as much as it entertains. Individuals clash with the confines of societal structures, brought to life by remarkable portrayals from actors like Louise Fletcher and a young Danny DeVito. The film transcends mere amusement as it delves into the depths of our very essence and defiance, ensuring its timeless appeal to generations with its enduring impact.\nThis is 40 (2012) In This Is 40 , director Judd Apatow takes a humorous yet honest look at the challenges of middle age. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann embody a husband and wife duo (which is loosely based on Apatow’s real-life marriage with Mann) wrestling with the messiness of raising kids, advancing in their work, and coming to terms with getting older. In this flick, the blend of relatable folks and everyday dramas shines through, all spiced up with Apatow's unique brand of humor. The movie offers a raw and honest glimpse into grown-up existence, weaving together moments of humor with genuine, honest emotion.\nThe Equalizer 3 (2023) In The Equalizer 3 , Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington reunite to deliver an adrenaline-fueled thriller. Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall, a former government assassin turned vigilante, now living a quieter life in Southern Italy. However, tranquility is short-lived when McCall uncovers a local mafia threatening his newfound friends. With Dakota Fanning and David Denman on board, the picture weaves nerve-wracking drama with fiery confrontations. Washington's powerful performance and Fuqua's ever-watching eye lift this movie above your usual thrill-ride, marking it a standout for those who love edge-of-your-seat stories with complex characters.\nEvery New Movie on Netflix in January 2024\nJanuary 1: Annabelle (2014); Annie (1982); Antz (1998); Aquaman (2018); Beethoven (1992); Bitconned (2024); Bruce Almighty (2003); BOWKYLION Lanta Concert (2023); Dawn of the Dead (2004); Gravity (2013); How to Train Your Dragon (2010); It’s Complicated (2009); Jackie Brown (1997); John Wick (2014); John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017); John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019); Jurassic Park (1993); The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997); Jurassic Park III (2001); Justice League (2016); Meet the Parents (2000); Meet the Fockers (2004); Little Fockers (2010); Malignant (2021); Mamma Mia!

También se contó con la colaboración del Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia (Unicef).\nLa ministra de Salud y segunda vicepresidenta de la República, Mary Munive Angermüller, asumió el compromiso de abordar la salud mental con la promesa de gestionar acciones adecuadas para brindar servicios y promover espacios protectores.\nOtros problemas de salud mental\nAdemás de suicidio, drogas y violencia, los costarricenses registran un aumento en trastornos asociados al estrés así como de ansiedad y depresión.\nLos desafíos también se trasladan a un aumento en los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria, déficit atencional, el trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, el trastorno afectivo bipolar y [problemas del sueño. ](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/salud/dormir-bien-es-un-sueno-imposible-para-miles-de/HCBACUP4S5DEFPAVDRLR3ESYMA/story/)\nLEA MÁS: [Tener salud mental es el primer requisito para estar bien pero, ¿cómo se logra?](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/salud/tener-salud-mental-es-el-primer-requisito-para/UCILUPLCDJG2TPJGIUQQYHIPKI/story/)\nEstos escenarios explican la necesidad de una nueva política que desarrolle un Modelo de Abordaje Integral de la Salud Mental que abarque la promoción de la salud mental, la prevención, la protección y cuidado, así como la atención en salud, y la rehabilitación e inclusión social y laboral, todo con un enfoque comunitario.\nEn la Política Nacional de Salud Mental 2024-2034 se pone énfasis en los llamados “activos comunitarios” entre los cuales están las redes de apoyo social, las oportunidades de acceso a educación y al trabajo, ambientes naturales y otros entornos que propicien el bienestar emocional y psicológico.\nDesde la comunidad, se espera fomentar la unidad social y facilitar la interacción entre los vecinos, fortalecer el sentido de pertenencia y reducir el aislamiento.\nSegún la Política, estos factores son cruciales para promover una salud mental positiva y prevenir afecciones en la salud mental.\nPara tener acceso a la Política Nacional de Salud Mental 2024-2034, se puede ingresar desde [AQUÍ](https://qr.me-qr.com/es/link-list/sktWDVc6/show).\nAdemás de esta Política, Costa Rica tiene una [Ley Nacional de Salud Mental. ](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/salud/ley-nacional-de-salud-mental-ya-rige-tras-su/PUSWCJVXUVDHHP6VAN3TSQAG6Q/story/)El reglamento a la ley fue sometido a consulta pública a inicios de noviembre.",
