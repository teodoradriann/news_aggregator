    "text": "Live updates: Follow the latest news on Israel-Gaza\nSeven workers taken hostage by a pro-Palestinian gunman at a plant near Istanbul owned by US consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble were released by Turkish police on Thursday evening.\nThe police raid took place almost nine hours into the standoff when the lone gunman went to the bathroom, local officials said.\nThe man, who was staging a protest against the war in Gaza, was detained unharmed, local Governor Seddar Yavuz told reporters.\n\"The man's aim was to stop Israel's massacre in Gaza and to open the Rafah gate in Egypt\" for the delivery of humanitarian aid for trapped civilians, Mr Yavuz said.\n\"When he went out for a bathroom break, our security forces carried out an operation without harming the hostages.\"\nREAD MORE Istanbul church attack: Assault on Christians is 'treason', Turkish MP says Photos and videos of the assailant shared earlier online by one of the hostages and verified by AFP showed a man, with his face hidden by a Palestinian scarf, holding a gun.\nHe had what appeared to be a suicide vest strapped to his chest.\nThe man was standing next to a drawing of the Palestinian flag and the words \"The door will be opened for Gaza\" painted on the wall in red.\nHaberturk TV earlier said police had established contact with the captor and were trying to negotiate the hostages' release.\n\"Earlier today, we evacuated our Gebze facility and are working with local authorities to resolve an urgent security situation,\" P&G said in a statement released to AFP.\n100 days of Israel Gaza war - in pictures\nMIDEAT ISRAEL PALESTINIANS GAZA CONFLICT Palestinian Muhammad Al Durra with his children in the ruins of a house in Rafah where they sheltered on January 11, 2024. EPA\nRelatives of the hostages questioned why the assailant would aim for workers in Turkey, which is strongly supportive of the Palestinian cause, to show his solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\"He supposedly does this for Islam but they are the ones who harm Islam the most,\" Sedat Degirmenci, whose son-in-law was taken hostage, told AFP.\nCigdem Aydemir, the mother of a 26-year-old woman taken hostage at the plant, said: \"If you do this for Palestine, go and fight there.\"\nLike other relatives, Ms Aydemir was following the hostage-taker's Instagram account for updates on the situation.\nThe account became inaccessible by Thursday evening.\n\"What does my daughter have to do with this?\" said Ms Aydemir. \"I can only pray.\"\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emerged as one of the Muslim world's harshest critics of Israel because of the civilian death toll from its campaign against Hamas militants.\nHe has called Israel a \"terrorist state\" and compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.\nMr Erdogan has also accused the US of supporting \"genocide\" in Gaza.\nHis comments reflect anger across the mainly Muslim – but officially secular – country at the US for its support for Israel .\nHundreds of protesters stormed a south-eastern Turkish air base used by US and British forces on the eve of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Ankara in November.\nTurkish online campaigns are also trying to organise boycotts of US products such as Coca-Cola and Starbucks.\nUpdated: February 01, 2024, 9:52 PM",

    "text": "[Venezuela](/temas/venezuela) Multitud de videos en redes sociales registran el grave derrame de petróleo en playas de Carabobo, en Venezuela En varios videos que rondan las redes sociales ha quedado registrado el grave derrame de petróleo sobre las playas del estado de Carabobo, en Venezuela. En imágenes difundidas por agencias de noticias como AFP y en redes sociales como X se observa a varios trabajadores intentando recoger con baldes el combustible que ya ha dejado varios peces muertos en las costas. El incidente fue reportado por el Sistema Nacional de Gestión de Riesgos como un \"derrame de hidrocarburos de la laguna de residuos\" sin ofrecer más detalles. De acuerdo con Yohan Flores, director regional de la ONG Azul Ambientalistas, el derrame fue detectado por primera vez el martes y este afecta a gran parte de las playas de Puerto Cabello. Por su parte, la estatal petrolera PDVSA no se ha pronunciado al respecto, incluso cuando ONGs como la Fundación Caribe Sur señalan que se originó en una laguna de desechos cerca de la refinería El Palito, una de las más importantes de Venezuela. Tras la emergencia, varios medios digitales han publicado algunos videos con críticas sobre la forma en que se está atendiendo la emergencia de tal importancia e impacto ambiental. “Refinería del palito presentó hoy un derrame petrolero. Pero no se preocupen que ya el gobierno mandó una cuadrilla con tobitos para recogerlo... se cuenta y no se cree”, indicó el periodista venezolano, Miguel Henrique Otero. Asimismo, se han conocido denuncias por parte del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Prensa de Venezuela (SNTP) contra la Dirección General de Contrainteligencia Militar (DGCIM) por impedir la cobertura periodística tras el derrame de crudo en las playas del estado Carabobo. “Funcionarios de la Dirección de Contrainteligencia Militar (DGCIM) prohibieron la cobertura del derrame de combustible en la Refinería El Palito, Carabobo, a las periodistas Ruth Lara Castillo y María Torres y al reportero gráfico Juan Carlos Gutiérrez este 27 de diciembre”, indicó en redes sociales el SNTP. Además, agregaron que, \"los funcionarios obligaron a las periodistas y al fotógrafo a borrar el material, incluso de las papeleras de sus teléfonos, para poder retirarse de la playa en la que se registró un derrame\". Es de mencionar que Venezuela, que tiene una de las reservas de petróleo más grandes del mundo, vio caer su producción de 3 millones de barriles por día hace más de una década a 850.000 barriles por día ahora, y se espera que la producción supere el millón de barriles a finales del próximo año. Con una producción de 850.000 barriles diarios, Venezuela espera escalar a los 900.000 barriles diarios a principios de 2024, y superar el millón de barriles en el transcurso del año.",

    "text": "There are limitless benefits to leaving the stresses of our daily lives behind and traveling to a new locale. Vacations are good for the soul. They expose us to a different way of living, new foods, new cultures, new perspectives. Unfortunately for one woman, it also exposed her to a new illness.\nA 30-year-old woman from New England, whose name has not been released, spent three weeks traveling to Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. When she came home, she had worms in her brain.\nMore from Little Things: Texas Mom Finds Worms In Baby Formula She’s Been Giving Her 8-Month-Old For Weeks\nThe woman, whose case has been documented in the New England Journal of Medicine, swam in the ocean and ate salads and sushi during her travels, according to the New York Post. By the time she got home, she was fatigued but she chalked it up to jet lag. Then she started feeling a burning sensation in her feet. The feeling traveled up to her legs and intensified with touch.\nMore from Little Things: Couple Shares Warning After Returning From Caribbean Vacation With Parasitic Hookworms\nAt this point she went to the doctor. She was hospitalized, but her test results came back normal. She was released from the hospital only to return again when the burning traveled up to her arms and was accompanied by a severe headache. Her roommate brought her to Massachusetts General Hospital after “she awoke [and] thought she needed to pack for vacation and was not redirectable,” Dr. Carlos A. Portales Castillo wrote in the study. He added that the woman was confused for several hours, People reports.\nEventually, doctors diagnosed her with Angiostrongyliasis, The Post reports. Also known as “rat lungworm,” it is a parasitic infection caused by the Angiostrongylusspecies of roundworms. As the nickname suggests, the infection is often found in rats. But it can also infect snails and slugs. Humans become infected after consumin raw or undercooked food. Doctors were able to come to this conclusion after performing a lumbar puncture and testing the woman’s spinal fluid. Castillo noticed inflammation in the spine and brain and connected the dots from there after her travel.\nIn Hawaii, this type of infection is a known issue. There were eight cases of rat lungworm in 2024, seven residents and one tourist, according to The Post. Doctors believe the patient became sick after eating something contaminated with infected slime from a slug or snail. Humans can also contract the illness from compromised fruits and vegetables, land crabs, and freshwater prawns. In addition to Hawaii, the condition has also been reported in Florida and Texas.\nMany of these cases often go undiagnosed or underreported, according to The Post. There is no cure for this infection. Instead, doctors focus on pain management. For this woman, doctors treated her meningitis (inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord) with the anti-inflammatory steroid prednisone. She remained in the hospital for six days before she returned home.",
