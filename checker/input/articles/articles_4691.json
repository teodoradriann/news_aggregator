    "text": "Sumaira FH Published September 06, 2024 | 02:00 AM\nZurich, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Sep, 2024) Botswana 's Letsile Tebogo produced a devastating finish to claim a thrilling victory in the men's 200m at the Diamond League meet in Zurich on Thursday.\nThe Olympic champion looked to have lost the race at a packed Letzigrund Stadium, but put on the afterburners to win in 19.55 seconds.\nThe 21-year-old Tebogo edged Olympic silver medallist Kenny Bednarek for the line, the American at 0.02sec.\nTwo more Americans followed, Erriyon Knighton rounding out the podium in 19.79sec, with Fred Kerley fourth in 19.81.\n\"I mean, that's the mentality that I've got, I always dig deep for the races and for everything, so, for me it means at lot,\" said Tebogo of his finish.\n\"Even tough it was not my 100 percent, I think that at the finals it is something that you will see,\" he said in reference to the Diamond League finals in Brussels next week.\nTebogo admitted that he had failed to produce a strong opening curve at the iconic track and field stadium in the Swiss city, as he had done for Olympic glory in Paris .\n\"Today, I did not run the curve, I only ran the home straight -- but with the Olympic final I ran throughout the whole race ,\" he said.\n\"That is something I will do at the Diamond League final because there is still more inside me. I mean, it is all about taking risks.\n\"Without risks there is no rewards, so I am taking all the risks that I have got. As long as I finish the season healty, then I am good to go.\"",

There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "text": "Papa Francisco: \"El que acoge a un migrante, acoge a Cristo\" El Papa, en su videomensaje de oración para este mes de junio, nos invita a rezar por quienes huyen de su país Tiempo de lectura: 1' Actualizado 31 may 2024 El Papa, en su videomensaje de oración para este mes de junio, nos invita a rezar por quienes huyen de su país. Ha dejado claro que ''el que acoge a un migrante, acoge a Cristo''. Están en el corazón de Francisco las personas que se ven forzadas a abandonar su tierra huyendo de guerras o de la pobreza. Por eso, el Video del Papa de este mes que difunde la Red Mundial de Oración del Papa, nos llama a rezar por ellos. En los últimos años, el número de desplazados ha superado el de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, según ACNUR. En el vídeo, que ha sido realizado con la colaboración de Tele VID y el apoyo del Dicasterio para el Servicio del Desarrollo Humano Integral - se nos narra una historia contada desde las fronteras de distintos lugares del mundo. Vemos rostros sufrientes, personas solas, desarraigadas de su tierra, invisibles a nuestros ojos. Observamos pies que caminan, niños a cuesta, bolsas a modo de maletas improvisadas que contienen toda una vida. Pero, a estas imágenes, se contraponen gestos de fraternidad, abrazos, proyectos de acogida. Y es que estos vídeos de oración que mensualmente nos hacen llegar a través de internet desde la Red Mundial de Oración del Papa, no son sólo un mensaje oral del pontífice, sino toda una catequesis que nos quiere mover el corazón y los labios, para rezar juntos y atrevernos a pedir la transformación de nuestro mundo donde más necesario es. El Papa nos recuerda en él a todos los cristianos que \"el que acoge a un migrante, acoge a Cristo\". - item no encontrado",
