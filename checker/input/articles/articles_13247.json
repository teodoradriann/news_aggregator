    "text": "Fiorentini dal cardinale Zuppi: \"Una riflessione sul volontariato\"\nI rappresentanti dell’Anpas – tra cui Iacopo Fiorentini, presidente della Croce verde di Castelnovo e Vetto, ma anche delle assistenze dell’Emilia-Romagna – hanno incontrato giovedì nell’Arcivescovado di Bologna il cardinale Matteo Maria Zuppi. Il porporato, presidente della Conferenza episcopale italiana, ha affrontato in particolare il temi della ‘carità cristiana’ in quanto l’Anpas, pur essendo un’associazione laica, è vicina alla gente che ha bisogno.\nErano presenti anche il presidente di Anpas nazionale, Niccolò Mancini: \"E’ stato un momento di riflessione sul complesso passaggio storico e sul ruolo del volontariato quale promotore di un modello sociale fondato sulla pace, solidarietà e collaborazione. Con il Cardinale ci siamo confrontati sul tema della responsabilità condivisa per riuscire a promuovere questa nuova visione\". Il reggiano Fiorentini: \"Per noi è stato un onore confrontarci col cardinale Zuppi. Un punto comune che ci unisce è l’attenzione quotidiana verso quello che possiamo definire come ‘il prossimo’ e cioè tutte le persone in difficoltà e in emergenza che, come Anpas, con le nostre 109 pubbliche assistenze in Regione, assistiamo. Dobbiamo sensibilizzare i giovani e abituarli al cambiamento, perché i giovani non sono solo il futuro, sono anche il presente\".\nSettimo Baisi\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "Tal y como estaba previsto, un verdadero festival de auroras boreales ha podido ser contemplado en gran parte de España esta madrugada, gracias a la potente actividad solar que ha desarrollado el Sol en las últimas horas. Este tipo de fenómenos, que ya tuvieron un episodio notable el pasado mes de mayo, han regresado a nuestro país esta noche, y han sido visibles desde Galicia hasta Baleares, pasando por Cataluña, el centro de la Península y, en realidad, casi toda España, según van comunicando diferentes observatorios astronómicos y aficionados a la fotografía, que han inmortalizado numerosas auroras de vistosos colores. Ávila, Ibiza, Cataluña, Vigo han sido algunos de los puntos desde se han podido fotografiar estas impactantes imágenes, que han teñido de colores rojizos y rosados el firmamento según avanzaba la noche. Se trata de un fenómeno inusual en nuestras latitudes, y más propias del norte de Europa, pero que son posibles gracias a la fuerte actividad del Sol que está registrándose estos meses. Una excepcional llamarada lanzada por el astro rey estos días ha sido la más potente de los últimos siete años, lo que ya presagiaba un nuevo episodio de auroras en latitudes tan bajas como la nuestra. Las auroras son provocadas por las partículas cargadas que llegan desde el Sol hasta la Tierra, donde interactúan con las capas altas de la atmósfera, iluminando el cielo. Los expertos auguran que las auroras aún podrán ser visibles durante alguna noche más en los cielos españoles.",

    "text": "Co-authored by Treading Softly. Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart is colloquially known as the \"unkillable Soldier.\" His military career spanned both World Wars and the Boer War, which occurred before World War One. During this time, he was shot in his stomach, ankle, leg, hip, ear, head, and face. He was caused to be blind in one eye. He was forced to tunnel out of the prisoner of war camp in World War Two. He also survived multiple plane crashes. After his illustrious military career, he ended up passing away peacefully at his home. Having survived some of the most brutal circumstances of the human condition, facing two global wars, being able to walk away, albeit still very injured, being blinded and missing an entire hand, and having multiple injuries all over his body, he was known as a soldier who just would not quit. There's a story told that when he took over his battalion during World War One, the soldiers were originally afraid to have him as their leader because he was known to bravely charge into battle wherever he was told to go. It is something that a lot of soldiers were scared to do in the trenches of World War One. The reason Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart is remembered is due to his undying spirit and ability to survive what took so many others' lives. When it comes to your portfolio, you want income producers in your portfolio who will not just give up whenever the wind blows. You want income that will just not quit. Today, I want to look at a company that not only has survived a complete overhaul of its management team for the better, but now exists in a sector that is widely considered to be in the middle of rough seas. I want to take a look at how its income continues to pour into my account and how it could continue to pour into yours. Let's dive in! BRSP: Conservative Balance Sheet In Action BrightSpire Capital, Inc. (NYSE: [BRSP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRSP)), yielding 11.8%, is a commercial mortgage real estate investment trust, or mREIT, that has taken a very conservative stance towards current market conditions. That conservatism continued in Q4, with BRSP reducing leverage to 1.8x debt-to-equity. BRSP has nothing drawn on its $165 million revolver, $203 million in unrestricted cash, and $879 million available on its repurchase facility. [Source](https://ir.brightspire.com/static-files/68ca913e-1014-48d2-a5d2-aaefdcde5917). Despite operating at such a low leverage level, BRSP earned $0.28 in Adjusted Distributable Earnings. This is significantly out-earning its $0.20 dividend. This strong liquidity position provides BRSP with a lot of flexibility to maximize value for the mortgages on their watch list, while also providing the potential to leverage up when BRSP believes it is safe to do so. Book value drifted down slightly as BRSP foreclosed on two properties. Note that book value has seen headwinds from credit losses over the past year, but earnings in excess of dividends work as a positive influence on book value. Credit losses tend to be lumpy. In an environment like today where borrowers have difficulty refinancing, they will be higher, and then they will slow down as the economy stabilizes and the number of weaker loans shrinks. Excess earnings, on the other hand, are more stable and keep recurring. BRSP's portfolio risk slightly improved in Q4, with only 1 property in their highest risk level. BRSP's overall CECL reserve declined from $90 million to $76 million. The [investor presentation](https://ir.brightspire.com/static-files/68ca913e-1014-48d2-a5d2-aaefdcde5917) provides a property-by-property breakdown of BRSP's watchlist (mortgages rated level 4 or 5), and management has been very willing to discuss the economics of specific properties on the earnings call. The bottom line is that commercial real estate has seen escalating defaults, and in 2023, BRSP experienced a few defaults within its portfolio. That is simply a reality of lending. However, the trends are turning favorable as interest rates have stabilized, and lending activity has picked up again. This makes it easier for borrowers to refinance. BRSP is trading at a staggering 40% discount to book value. While there likely will be a few more realized credit losses and BRSP will probably foreclose on more properties, that discount is extreme. BRSP has ample liquidity and a flexible [balance sheet](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRSP/balance-sheet) to manage its portfolio in a way that maximizes its recovery. Meanwhile, BRSP's earnings have routinely exceeded the dividend, and have been a positive influence on book value. The market providing us with such a steep discount on BRSP is a gift. Conclusion The management team currently heading up BRSP took over a wreck of a company and has transformed it into a conservative powerhouse in their sector. Even in the midst of all of the struggles that this sector is facing, BRSP is able to continue to pay a strongly covered dividend while maneuvering carefully with their holdings to ensure that the dividend is not at risk. BRSP is not the only company in this sector that has seen a complete overhaul in its management team. ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. ( [ACR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACR)) also saw an overhaul of its management team as well but has taken a different route. They are not currently actively rewarding their shareholders with dividends at all. When it comes to your retirement, you're going to want some income producers who capture the spirit of being \"unkillable.\" These are going to be dividend-paying companies that provide you with income, whether it is raining or sunny, whether the wind is blowing or the ocean is calm â€“ they're companies that you can rely upon. With the current management team that is overseeing BRSP, this is a company that can fill that spot in your portfolio to help pay your way through your retirement. This way, the time you spend in your retirement is focused on developing relationships with the ones you love or fine-tuning those hobbies that you've picked up. Retirement should be a time to focus on what you enjoy instead of having to constantly manage what you must oversee. Maximizing enjoyment and reducing the headaches is going to unlock so much more happiness and potential from your retirement. That's the beauty of my Income Method. That's the beauty of income investing. Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.

NASA's Artemis III mission plans to study possibilities; all you need to know\n\"SWPC forecasters will monitor NOAA and NASA's space assets for the onset of a geomagnetic storm,\" it added.\nA coronial mass ejection is an erruption of solar material. When they arrive at earth, a geomagnetic storm can result. The NOAA SWPC also added that the CMEs are anticipated to merge and arrive at Earth late May 10 to early May 11. Amid this, aurora may become visible in many parts of the United States. As per NIAA SWPC, aurora may become visible over many of the northern states and some of the lower midwest to Oregon. A report by Washington Post also added that chances of seeing the auroras is also expected in Canada and northern Europe. Apart from this, clear skies has been predicted over the central states and West Coast of the United States.\nNASA video shows what happens if you go inside a black hole; watch the journey into 'nothingness'\nAmong other impacts, the NOAA SWPC advisory stated, \"Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth's surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations. SWPC has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action. Geomagnetic storms can also trigger spectacular displays of aurora on Earth. A severe geomagnetic storm includes the potential for aurora to be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California.\"\nSpeaking on the Geomagnetic Storm, Bill Murtagh who is the program coordinator at NOAA's SWPC said, \"It is a rather volatile situation on the sun right now that we're monitoring very closely. We're going to get somewhat of a prolonged period of geomagnetic storming,\" as quoted by The Washington Post .\nIn another news, on May 9, NASA also released some images of solar flares captured by NASA Goddard. In a post on Instagra, NASA wrote, \"Late at night on May 7 and in the wee hours of May 8, the Sun emitted this powerful pair of solar flares. These two energetic flashes with dancing loops were captured by @NASAGoddard's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which always has its eye on the Sun.\"\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by NASA (@nasa)\n\\n",

    "title": "Embraer C-390 Millennium – bridging continents, empowering missions: The dawn of aerospace supremacy – ACE (Aerospace Central Europe)",
    "text": "Revolutionizing global air mobility\nThe Embraer C-390 Millennium, a state-of-the-art multi-mission military transport aircraft, heralds a new era in medium air mobility, characterized by unparalleled flexibility, advanced technology, and exceptional efficiency. Conceived to surpass the rigorous demands of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB), the C-390 Millennium blends a highly versatile, multi-mission platform with extraordinarily low operating costs and swift turnaround capabilities. This synthesis delivers an unmatched combination of availability, productivity, and cost-efficiency to air forces across the globe, setting a new benchmark in its category.\nEmbarking on a New Era of Aerospace Excellence\nOriginating from Embraer, a globally recognized aerospace powerhouse with over fifty years of pioneering history, the C-390 is a cornerstone of Embraer Defense & Security’s contemporary and innovative product suite. Embraer’s esteemed legacy, shaped by the relentless evolution of its commercial, executive, and defense offerings, emphasizes a commitment to high availability and maintainability. These foundational principles are intricately integrated into the C-390’s DNA, establishing it as Embraer’s most technologically advanced and sophisticated transport aircraft to date.\nA Vanguard of Military Mission Systems\nThe military mission capabilities of the C-390 Millennium are nothing short of remarkable, featuring the latest advancements in tactical radar, self-protection mechanisms, avionics, vision enhancement, as well as advanced cargo handling and air drop technologies. Its versatile “one aircraft, many capabilities” design philosophy enables rapid reconfiguration for an extensive variety of operations, encompassing aerial resupply, assault, air-to-air refueling (with the KC-390 variant), aerial firefighting, search and rescue (SAR), humanitarian aid, medical evacuation, and special operations support. Moreover, the aircraft’s compatibility with a detachable EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infra-Red) pod significantly broadens its operational scope in SAR, Maritime Patrol, and Special Operations.\nEngineered to thrive in the most challenging conditions—from searing deserts to the frozen polar regions—the C-390 showcases unparalleled performance in austere environments with minimal ground support. Its proficiency in executing operations from unpaved or compromised runways underscores its unmatched adaptability and resilience.\nSurpassing Performance Benchmarks\nThe C-390 Millennium’s performance metrics significantly eclipse those of other medium-sized military transport aircraft. Achieving a maximum speed of 470 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS), a maximum payload of 26 tonnes, and a range of 1,470 nautical miles with a 23-tonne load, it outmatches medium lift turboprops by an impressive 40% in range, speed, and payload efficiency. This remarkable performance, coupled with its operational versatility, has attracted the attention of governments and air forces worldwide, cementing the C-390 as the quintessential next-generation multi-mission transport aircraft.\nStrategic Integrations and Expanding Global Footprint\nThe induction of the C-390 Millennium into the Portuguese Air Force (FAP) at Beja Air Base signifies a major milestone. Meeting the stringent standards of Portugal’s National Aeronautical Authority (AAN) and equipped with standard NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) equipment, this inaugural KC-390 Millennium aircraft for the FAP exemplifies the successful partnership between Embraer, OGMA, and FAP. Portugal’s commitment, highlighted by the procurement of five KC-390 aircraft along with an encompassing service and support agreement and a flight simulator, underscores its significant role as the foremost international partner in the C-390 program. This collaboration not only bolsters economic growth and job creation but also catalyzes technological advancements within Portugal.\nThe operational capabilities of the C-390 Millennium, particularly emphasized by its unique air-to-air refueling configuration, highlight its operational flexibility and cost-effectiveness, distinguishing it in the military tactical transport aircraft category. Its capacity to transport more payload, achieve higher speeds, and cover longer ranges than comparable aircraft, coupled with its ability to perform a wide spectrum of missions from diverse runway conditions, solidifies the C-390 Millennium’s status as a modern, efficient, and supremely capable military transport solution.\nThe selection of the C-390 by several European countries, including Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, and notably the Czech Republic, reflects its growing international appeal and acknowledgment of its superior capabilities, reliability, and performance. This broadening interest from nations across Europe and beyond not only underscores the strategic importance and operational excellence of the C-390 Millennium but also exemplifies Embraer’s dedication to advancing global air mobility solutions. As the C-390 continues to captivate global air forces, its expanding international footprint attests to its transformative potential, ready to meet the multifaceted and dynamic mission requirements of modern and future military operations. The adoption of the C-390 by these nations represents a significant endorsement of its innovative design, operational versatility, and the strategic advantage it offers, paving the way for a new chapter in global military aviation.\nWritten and edited by: Katerina Urbanova\nPhoto credit: Embraer Defense\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.
