    "text": "Hari Hara Veera Mallu Review, Rating and Release LIVE Updates: Telugu star Pawan Kalyan’s long-delayed period action-adventure Hari Hara Veera Mallu: Part 1 has finally hit the screens, and a festive spirit has gripped the Telugu states with fans of the “Power Star” celebrating the return of their beloved action hero to the silver screen with full fervour. One of the most anticipated Telugu films of the year, it is expected that Hari Hara Veera Mallu will rescue the Tollywood box office from the rough patch it has been going through since the beginning of 2025.\nHowever, considering that the movie faced multiple postponements, with the premiere date being changed at least three times just this year and filming reportedly continuing until late 2024 — suggesting that the makers had limited time to complete post-production work, including VFX, it remains to be seen if the film can keep the promise it made to Pawan Kalyan’s fans.\nNonetheless, the advance booking for the big-budget actioner, as per Sacnilk, has been strong so far. As of 9 pm on Wednesday, the movie’s first day pre-sales gross had crossed Rs 30 crore worldwide. While Hari Hara Veera Mallu had grossed Rs 7 crore from the Telugu states alone, the total advance bookings for the first day across India had touched Rs 20 crore. The overseas advance collection currently stands at Rs 10 crore.\nGoing by the current trends, Hari Hara Veera Mallu is showing potential to outperform the last three films of Pawan Kalyan in terms of opening collections. While 2023’s Bro grossed Rs 35.2 crore domestically and recorded an India nett collection of Rs 30.05 crore on release day, 2022’s Bheemla Nayak registered Rs 43.10 crore gross (Rs 37.15 crore nett) and 2021’s Vakeel Saab minted Rs 40.10 crore nett.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Movie Review, Rating and Release LIVE Updates\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Overall a good film with bad vfx'\nA fan @Vinny_tweetz posted via X, \"Very good first half Second half first 40 mins avrg Last 40 mins are good !! Keeravani’s score is the heart of the film. Kusthi fight & pre climax fights stand out,Songs are good Vfx is below par !! Overall a good film with bad vfx #HariHaraVeeraMallureview.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Screenplay has an outdated feel to it in many places'\n\"#HariHaraVeeraMallu Strictly Mediocre 1st Half! Apart from PKs presence, a few blocks came out well mainly the intro block from the title cards to PKs introduction sequence. Keervanis bgm is the lifeline so far. However, the screenplay has an outdated feel to it in many places. The VFX is amateur. Dubbing is off with many characters not having proper lip sync and even PKs dubbing feels grainy, \"shared a X user.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Pawan Kalyan lost his skill in acting'\nA user @urstrulyPeter shared via X, \"Done with my show, painful 2nd half. Pawan Kalyan lost his skill in acting & Aura. Bobby deol performance ok ok. Nidhi in pretty on screen. VFX worst to core. Not even a single ticket worthy episode. Climax is a big let down. 1.75/5 #HariHaraVeeraMallu.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Did not live up to our expectations'\n@HanuNews posted on X, \"#HariHaraVeeraMallu is Disappointing We were excited for this magnum opus after hearing the songs and seeing the release trailer, but it did not live up to our expectations in terms of story or visual effects. Keeravani is one of the few people who did their job from the start. Pawan Kalyan acting strains the patience. Nidhi Agarwal's outstanding performance is wasted. We are not sure why this film released.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: Gopichandh Malineni shares his best wishes\nDirector Gopichandh Malineni posted on X, \"Powerstorm loading! Wishing the charismatic @PawanKalyan garu and the #HariHaraVeeraMallu team a phenomenal release. The wait ends, and history begins!\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'A major disappointment'\n\"From a technical standpoint, the VFX is poor. Many scenes, especially in the second half, appear unfinished and clumsy. Dubbing is another major issue, with several characters, including Pawan Kalyan, suffering from noticeable lip-sync and voice clarity problems. Keeravani’s music remains the film’s only saving grace. Overall, Pawan Kalyan’s presence, a few sequences in the first half, and Keeravani’s music are the only aspects that work. The rest is a major disappointment!,\" read a review for the Pawan Kalyan's film.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Second half completely falls apart'\n@venkyreviews posted on X, \"#HariHaraVeeraMallu is a lackluster period action drama, weighed down by an outdated and incoherent screenplay, further hampered by subpar technical quality! The first half is somewhat tolerable and includes a few well-executed sequences, such as the introductory block and the kusthi fight. While the screenplay still feels dated, Keeravani’s background score manages to elevate certain moments in this half. However, the second half completely falls apart and never recovers. It feels both outdated and directionless, as if the director lost track of the plot entirely and added random scenes.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: 'A lot of hearts gone into this'\nActor Varun Tej Konidela shared via X, \"It's Veera's Time Wishing the team of #HariHaraVeeraMallu all the success A lot of hearts gone into this, hoping for a powerful blockbuster! Super excited to watch Kalyan babai again on the Big Screen!! Power storm is coming!\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: Chandrababu Naidu shares his best wishes\nChief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu took to his X account to post in Telugu, \"Pawan Kalyan garu's fans and audience, heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of the release of #HariHaraVeeraMallu, which they have been eagerly awaiting for a long time. My friend Pawan Kalyan garu... I wish that 'Hari Hara Veera Mallu,' his first performance in a film crafted with a historical storyline, becomes a super hit. While fulfilling crucial responsibilities as the Deputy CM in the government... I hope this movie, performed by managing time, captivates all sections of the audience.\"",

    "text": "Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween Continue Commitment to Students\nEgg Harbor Township, N.J. — Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween has continued its annual commitment to the Stockton University Foundation by contributing another $250,000, bringing its contribution to $750,000 over the past three years alone.\nSpencer’s & Spirit Halloween CEO Steven Silverstein presented Stockton President Joe Bertolino with a check for $250,000 this month while Bertolino visited the company’s headquarters in Egg Harbor Township. Silverstein spoke about the company’s commitment and enthusiasm for the college and its students.\nHe also shared that the company currently employs more than 100 Stockton alumni, about 15% of its total workforce, and has had more than 50 interns from the university.\n“We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Stockton University and are humbled by their dedication to students and emphasis on ongoing education and career growth,” Silverstein said.\nThis year’s donation will benefit the Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween Endowed Scholarship\nat Stockton, the Summer Entrepreneurship and Business Academy (SEBA), the new [Digital Studies Program](https://www.stockton.edu/general-studies/digital-studies.html) in the [William T. Daly School of General Studies](https://www.stockton.edu/general-studies/), and additional School of Business education initiatives.\nBertolino emphasized the impact the company has on students, especially those who require financial aid and scholarships to fund their education.\n“I can’t begin to tell you how important this relationship is and the impact that it has on our students,” he said. “I thank you so much for what you have done and for the partnership that we have.”\nStockton senior Karishma Karabi was a recipient of the Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween\nScholarship this year. The [Computer Science](https://www.stockton.edu/business/computer-science.html) major dreams of creating an app to help support the academic success and emotional\nwell-being of her fellow students.\nSpencer's and Spirit Halloween employ more than 100 Stockton alumni. The photo above are some of those employees at the company's Egg Harbor Township office.\n“I want to thank you for believing in my potential and allowing me to continue to grow with this amazing community at Stockton University,” said the Egg Harbor Township resident. “The encouragement I received solidified my decision to stick with my major no matter any obstacle that I may face.”\nBertolino also spoke about the financial support for [SEBA](/business/seba.html), a week-long summer camp hosted by the [School of Business](/business/) in Atlantic City that lets high school students learn the basics of entrepreneurship.\nThe camp culminates in a business plan competition judged by faculty, advisory board\nmembers and community leaders.\n“You are helping to provide students with an experience that allows them to learn and grow,” Bertolino said. “And every one of those students goes through that experience for free because your scholarship dollars are helping to cover that entire cost.”\nOne of the beneficiaries of the SEBA donation is Jennifer Guemes, a senior at Camden County Technical School. Her team won the business plan competition this summer, and she credits SEBA with helping her select Stockton as her top choice for college.\n“I had a great time at SEBA. We were able to network with people around the area and learn new entrepreneurship skills,” said the Lindenwold native. “We were able to stay on the Atlantic City campus for a week. It was really fun, and it gave me an inside look at what being a Stockton student actually is.”\nGuemes said she was really happy to be able to meet the people that helped fund her ability to attend the camp and added that Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween seem like a cool place to work someday.\nJohn Bee couldn’t agree more. The Longport resident works as an analyst in the planning\ndepartment at Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween, and is one semester away from earning\nhis [master’s in Business Administration](/graduate/business-administration.html) from Stockton. He credits the university with helping him get his job at the university’s\nspring Career and Internship Fair.\n“I got an internship over the summer. That internship got me three credits for school and got my foot in the door here,” he said.\nBee hopes to keep working his way up the ladder at Spencer’s & Spirit Halloween after he finishes his MBA.\n“It’s just such a great environment,” he said. “I’ve made friends, and it’s just somewhere you’re excited to come to work because you get to see people that you’re happy to see. You get to work for a great company that is doing great things.”\nThe $250,000 gift was also used by the [Stockton Foundation](/development-foundation/foundation/index.html) as a way to challenge Stockton alumni and the community to contribute during Stockton’s\nannual day of giving, Ospreys Give. Dan Nugent, executive director of the Foundation,\nsaid more than 1,150 donors participated this year, raising more than $445,000 in\nOctober.\n-- Story by Mark Melhorn, photos provided by Spencer's and Spirit Halloween",

    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — October continues to deliver on celestial treats. The biggest supermoon of the year will be glowing bright in the night sky. October's full moon is called the Hunter's Moon in reference to the hunting needed to prepare for the winter season.\nThe reason it will appear so large is thanks to its proximity to Earth. The moon is in what's called a perigee position, which is when its closest to Earth. When it's in the farthest position from Earth, it's called apogee.\nThe moon will be rising in the east, opposite where you can see Comet Tsuchishan-ATLAS in the west. This will be visible again Friday, but the moon may appear just slightly smaller.\nOctober has been full of nighttime events. The month started just as Earth captured a new \"minimoon.\" A bus-sized asteroid entered Earth's orbit Sunday, Sept. 29. It's too small to be visible to amateur skywatchers, but with a little help from experts, you can witness this \"second moon.\" The official name of the asteroid is 2024 PT5. It's expected to be caught up in our orbit until November 25.\nCredit: KXTV The excitement really started to build when an X-Class flare was detected coming from the center of the Sun. The solar wind carrying that magnetic energy took a couple days to reach Earth traveling at 2.5 million mph, but it was worth the wait. Conditions were nearly ideal to carry it south from the North Pole. People as far as Central California were able to escape city lights to see the Aurora Borealis glow in the night sky with shades of pink, purple and green.\nCredit: Tracie J Ramos Another magical dance of the Aurora Borealis over Lincoln Ca! I gazed in amazement! Taken 9:49 pm 10/10/24\nCredit: Tracie J Ramos Just as the Northern Lights were wrapping up, another light ripped across the sky. Comet Tsuchishan-ATLAS was starting its show in the western sky. NASA Earth Observatory says this is a once-in-80,000 year sight!\nThe comet comes from the outer reaches of our solar system and was most visible in the Southern Hemisphere and Tropics until October 8. It will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere through much of the week of October 14.\nCredit: Ken Hunt The comet got its name in 2023 from two discoveries. One was when it was identified by observers at China's Tsuchinshan Observatory. The other was when it appeared on an ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System) telescope in South Africa.\nCredit: KXTV Do you have photos of these amazing night sky treats?

    "text": "A 30-year-old Eastvale woman who illegally obtained nearly $2 million in federal benefits distributed after filing fraudulent applications for loans and other aid during the coronavirus pandemic was sentenced Wednesday to seven years in prison.\nJasmine Unique Mallad McCarter pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nDuring a hearing at U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles Wednesday, Judge Maame Frimpong imposed the stipulated sentence and ordered McCarter to pay $1.76 million in restitution — equal to the amount she illegally procured.\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, in the early 2020s, the defendant impersonated various unidentified parties whose personal identifying information she acquired, and then proceeded to use those names, Social Security numbers and other details to apply for pandemic-relief small business loans, unemployment benefits and Los Angeles County economic opportunity grants.\n“McCarter charged fees to instruct others how to apply for government benefits for which they were not eligible without getting caught,” according to an agency statement.\n“Also for a fee, McCarter served as a broker for counterfeit documents. In some instances, McCarter and her co-conspirators used the counterfeit documents to trick the government into paying unjustified benefits.”\nThe defendant went so far as to advertise her illicit benefits filching operation via Instagram, identifying herself using the handles JassyMc and EliteRealEstateBusiness.\n“McCarter referred to herself as the `Jass-of-All-Trades’ in social media posts because she could file fraudulent unemployment insurance applications, file grant applications and broker counterfeit documents and identification in return for a fee,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.\n“According to her posts, she charged a fee for introducing customers to a connection at the California Department of Motor Vehicles, who could help bypass requirements for smog checks, insurance and registration.”\nThe case was investigated by multiple agencies, including the FBI and U.S. Departments of Labor and Homeland Security.\nThere was no information regarding any prior criminal history, and prosecutors did not specify whether any of the defendant’s co-conspirators were charged in connection with the investigation.",
