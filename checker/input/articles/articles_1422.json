WHY IT IS IMPORTANT In November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 03:34 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 03:34 IST The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT In November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail. Beijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison. KEY QUOTES The trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of \"immense pressure and fear,\" compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper. Chung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory \"deradicalization\" program in detention. Guards \"kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,\" Chung was quoted as saying. \"We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn't disagree or argue back.\" Chung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, \"just as before.\" CONTEXT Chung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect. Prosecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.

    "text": "A Operação Ultima Ratio, realizada pela Polícia Federal (PF) nesta quinta-feira, não atingiu apenas a alta cúpula do Tribunal de Justiça de Mato Grosso do Sul (TJMS), mas também todos os setores de justiça do estado.\nPreocupados com a repercussão da operação, a Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil (OAB/MS) criou uma comissão para acompanhar de perto as investigações.\nEm nota, o presidente da OAB/MS, Bitto Pereira, determinou que a comissão seja composta pelos conselheiros estaduais Ana Maria Medeiros, como presidente, Bruno Azambuja e Gustavo Gottardi, como membros, que acompanham as investigações em andamento pelo Superior Tribunal de Justiça .\nPara apuração do caso, o Tribunal de Ética da OAB/MS aguardará a coleta de informações sobre os profissionais citados para a investigação devida. A entidade reafirma seu compromisso com a transparência, ética e combate à corrupção, sempre em estrita obediência aos princípios da legalidade, contraditório e ampla defesa.\nOperação\nA Operação na manhã de hoje (24), afastou o conselheiro Osmar Domingues Jeronymo do TCE-MS (Tribunal de Contas do Estado). Atualmente ele é corregedor-geral da Corte Fiscal. Além dele, Danillo Moya Jeronymo, sobrinho do conselheiro, que é servidor no TJMS, também foi afastado de suas funções.\nDe acordo com as investigações, há indícios de envolvimento de advogados e filhos de desembargadores nas vendas de decisões judiciais, lavagem de dinheiro, organização criminosa, extorsão e falsificação de escrituras públicas no Poder Judiciário de Mato Grosso do Sul.\nDesembargadores afastados\nDurante a operação na manhã desta quinta-feira (24), foram afastados pelo Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) cinco desembargadores, um juiz de primeira instância, um procurador do Ministério Público Estadual (MPE) e um conselheiro do Tribunal de Contas de Mato Grosso do Sul (TCE).\nA reportagem do Correio do Estado esteve no Tribunal de Justiça de Mato Grosso do Sul (TJMS) para acompanhar os trabalhos da Polícia Federal. Foi apurado que os policiais \"visitaram\" os gabinetes dos cinco desembargadores e mesas de dois assessores.\nA equipe flagrou os agentes retirando um cofre do prédio do órgão. O item era tão pesado que teve que ser transportado utilizando uma cadeira de escritório com rodinhas, e precisou de três agentes para ser colocado na viatura policial. Veja o vídeo:\nEm um outro momento, os agentes saíram do prédio com uma \"bolsa gigante\", cheia de documentos e outros itens, que aparentava estar pesada, visto que foi carregada por dois agentes.\nAlém do TJMS, a Polícia Federal tem mais de 200 agentes ditribuídos em 40 equipes cumprindo mandados de busca e apreensão em casas, no fórum e em escritórios de advocacia, localizados em Campo Grande, Brasília, São Paulo e Cuiabá.\nO Correio do Estado entrou em contato com o Tribunal de Justiça e com o Ministério Público em busca de mais informações, mas não teve retorno até o momento de publicação do material.\nAlta cúpula\nOs 5 magistrados da alta cúpula do Judiciário foram afastados de suas atividades por 180 dias. Eles terão que usar tornozeleira eletrônica e estão proibidos de acessar as dependências dos órgãos públicos e de manter contato com outras pessoas investigadas.\nInformações preliminares apontam que os desembargadores afastados foram: Marcos Brito; Vladimir Abreu; Sérgio Martins (presidente do TJ), Sideni Pimentel e Alexandre Aguiar Bastos.\nOperação\nA ação teve o apoio da Receita Federal e é um desdobramento da Operação Mineração de Ouro, deflagrada em 2021, na qual foram apreendidos materiais com indícios da prática dos referidos crimes.",

    "text": "SEBASTIAN, Fla. — Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) crews have arrived in Central Florida to assist in restoring power following the devastation of Hurricane Milton. The crews are part of a large-scale mutual-assistance effort involving more than 50,000 workers from 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada, according to the Edison Electric Institute. Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Fla., as a Category 3 storm and left at least 16 people dead and caused widespread damage, including dangerous storm surges, strong winds, heavy rains and flooding. The storm also spawned at least 36 confirmed tornadoes. As of Friday, PG&E said more than 2 million customers in Florida were without power, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) reporting about 680,000 outages. PG&E's base camp is set up at the Sebastian airport, located on the Atlantic Coast between Cape Canaveral and West Palm Beach. PG&E said crews are tasked with replacing broken power poles, cross-arms and installing new transformers and power lines. PG&E said crews are working to restore 13 circuits serving approximately 27,000 customers. Bobby Severson, incident commander of PG&E’s deployment, said, \"We left California a week ago, heading to Georgia to help utility customers there after Hurricane Helene. We are now in a different state responding to the damage from a different hurricane, but our mission to safely restore power to customers who need it as a first step to getting their lives back in order remains the same.\" The PG&E team, consisting of 400 workers and 300 vehicles, initially traveled to Georgia to assist with restoration efforts following Hurricane Helene. After completing their work in Georgia, PG&E said they moved to Florida to prepare for Hurricane Milton. Gavin Salcido, a general construction worker with PG&E, shared his experience from a previous mutual-assistance mission after Superstorm Sandy. \"It was very rewarding,\" he said. \"The people who we helped, you could tell they didn’t have much, but they were there and brought us coffee. And when we did get the power back on, they were so grateful.\" -- To report errors or issues with this article please[ email](mailto:comments@krcrtv.com?subject=Story%20Issues) the editorial team.",

    "text": "IAM Union Shows Powerful Solidarity at LCLAA’s 25th National Convention\nAugust 7, 2025\nThe strength, diversity, and unity of the IAM Union were front and center this week as IAM Union members and leaders gathered at the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement’s (LCLAA) 25th National Membership Convention in Atlanta. IAM Union delegates from across the country participated in a full slate of workshops, panel discussions, and plenary sessions focused on empowering Latino and Latina union members and mobilizing workers for collective action.\nThis year’s theme, “United We Stand: Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers and Protecting Our Legacy” (Construyendo Puentes, Rompiendo Barreras y Protegiendo Nuestro Legado), focused on the urgent challenges facing Latino communities and the labor movement as a whole. From immigration and economic equity to leadership development and workplace justice, the convention served as a powerful reminder that when we uplift one another, the entire movement grows stronger.\nIAM General Secretary-Treasurer Dora Cervantes was featured in the panel discussion “Breaking Barriers and Leading with Purpose: Honoring the Leadership of Latinas in Today’s Labor Movement,” alongside SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Rocío Sáenz and Manassas City Council Member and LiUNA 572 Business Manager Sonia Vásquez Luna. The panel highlighted personal stories of perseverance, leadership, and a call to inspire the next generation of Latinas in labor and civic life.\n“Hardships are what make you strong – there’s no such thing as going back,” said Cervantes, urging young Latinas to stay resilient and lead with purpose in the labor movement.\nThe convention also featured timely workshops on organizing, immigration reform, careers in the building trades, and social justice advocacy. One standout session, “Career and Technical Education: Preparing Latino Workers for the Jobs of the Future,” included IAM Human Rights Director Nicole Fears, who spoke about the IAM’s impactful partnership with Aviation High School in Queens, N.Y. This collaboration provides hands-on aviation training, career guidance, and scholarships to high school students, offering a direct pipeline to good union jobs in the skilled trades.\nLCLAA continues to be a vital voice within the AFL-CIO, uniting Latino labor leaders, activists, and allies in the fight for justice and inclusion.\nDelegates also heard from national labor leaders including AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond, AFGE President Everett Kelley, and AFT President Randi Weingarten, among others, all emphasizing the importance of building a movement rooted in solidarity and shared purpose as policies are being in place to target specific groups.\n“We have to protect our people and this is not just about Latinos,” said LCLAA National President and AFT Executive Vice President Evelyn DeJesus. “An injury to one is an injury to all.”\nAs a proud affiliate of LCLAA and a strong advocate for justice, the IAM remains committed to organizing, educating, and lifting up working people.\n“The labor movement must reflect the strength of all its members – regardless of background, status, or where they come from,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant. “Equity and fairness aren’t just values; they’re commitments that shape everything we fight for. At the IAM, we believe in building a union where every worker has a seat at the table, a voice in the room, and the power to shape their future.”\nFor more information and to join LCLAA, visit lclaa.org.",

    "text": "Philadelphia Eagles e Green Bay Packers, duas franquias icônicas, vão se enfrentar a partir das 21h15 (horário de Brasília) nesta sexta-feira, na Neo Química Arena, casa do Corinthians, em São Paulo. O jogo, que também será o primeiro da NFL na América do Sul, terá como objetivo emular um ambiente similar ao do Super Bowl para conquistar o mercado brasileiro, o terceiro maior da liga depois de Estados Unidos e México, segundo os organizadores. O duelo entre Eagles e Packers, para o qual é aguardada a presença de 46 mil espectadores, vários deles vindos dos Estados Unidos, terá uma apresentação da cantora Anitta no intervalo. \"Vimos a paixão, a demanda e estamos ansiosos para viver o jogo de sexta-feira\", disse a jornalistas Peter O'Reilly, vice-presidente- executivo de Negócios de Clube e Eventos internacionais da NFL. Mercado sedutor Segundo um estudo encomendado pela NFL, o Brasil tem 38 milhões de fãs de futebol americano. Em 2015, eram apenas três milhões os aficionados por este esporte difícil de compreender para muitos no país. Ver essa foto no Instagram O crescimento vertiginoso permitiu que São Paulo se juntasse a um seleto grupo de cidades (Londres, Minique, Frankfurt, Cidade do México e Toronto) que já receberam um jogo da liga de futebol americano fora dos Estados Unidos. Ano que vem será a vez de Madri. \"Depois do jogo vamos avaliar as oportunidades no futuro para que possamos ter mais jogos no Brasil\", disse O'Reilly, que anunciou a abertura de um escritório da NFL no país. Amantes dos esportes, com o futebol como paixão nacional, os brasileiros consomem bastante a cultura americana. A NBA, por exemplo, tem no país seu segundo maior mercado internacional, atrás apenas da China. Mas no caso do futebol americano, um fator que colaborou com a popularidade do esporte no país foi o casamento da modelo Gisele Bündchen com o lendário ex-quarterback Tom Brady. Preocupações de segurança O Estádio do Corinthians, palco da abertura da Copa do Mundo de 2014, passou por diversos ajustes para receber o duelo entre Eagles e Packers, que competem na Conferência Nacional (NFC), uma das duas que compõem a NFL. O evento vai coincidir com o horário do jogo da Seleção Brasileira contra o Equador pelas Eliminatórias Sul-Americanas para a Copa do Mundo de 2026, que será disputado em Curitiba. A emoção que a chegada das equipes americanas despertou não foi a mesma de alguns jogadores, que temem por sua segurança. O wide receiver AJ Brown e o cornerback Darius Slay, do Philadelphia Eagles, afirmaram que a franquia os orientou a não deixar os hotéis. Embora tenha se desculpado depois, Slay chegou a dizer que não queria vir ao Brasil. \"Não chegamos para conhecer a cidade, não estamos de férias. Queremos vencer\", ressaltou Brown. Em termos meramente esportivos, o técnico dos Eagles, Nick Sirianni, vai querer provar o valor do astro da equipe, o running back Saquon Barkley, e superar as aposentadorias do center Jason Kelce e do defensive tackle Fletcher Cox. Já o treinador do Green Bay Packers, Matt LaFleur, vai liderar um elenco muito jovem, cujo destaque é o quarterback Jordan Love. O jogo entre as franquias que somam cinco títulos do Super Bowl (quatro dos Packers e um dos Eagles) será o segundo da semana de abertura da temporada regular da NFL. O Kansas City Chiefs de Patrick Mahomes, atual bicampeão, recebe nesta quinta-feira (5) o Baltimor Ravens.",

    "text": "SANFORD (WGME) – Susan Lamoreau, who has been teaching financial literacy for more than 30 years, wishes she learned some of the things her students are now required to learn at the Sanford Regional Technical Center at Sanford High School. Lamoreau brought the GOOD DAY MAINE crew into one of her classes and talk to students about the curriculum and importance of learning about finances at a young age. “It’s a skill that you need for life and as they're making their plans to go onto college or go out into the workforce, and they change their mind and say 'business is not my forte, not what I want,' they still have these lifelong skills,” Lamoreau says. Andre Clark, a junior in Lamoreau’s class, tells us he is “very grateful that I can have this opportunity to take this class. I know so many other kids in this world would love to take this class, I'm just very lucky and fortunate I'm able to.” Classmates including Ethan Wilfong, Lexi Hayward, and Cullen St. Cyr echo this. During Financial Literacy Month, the Financial Authority of Maine (FAME) is [offering free tolls for students, adults, and employers](https://www.famemaine.com/) to both learn more about how to deal with their hard-earned cash and avoid getting into trouble financially. Mary Dyer is the financial education programs manager for FAME. She says one of the biggest concerns she sees is a lack of an emergency savings fund. “We studied data across the state and across the country: not enough people have efficient emergency savings set aside - to kind of weather that rainy day or that emergency in your lives,” Dyer says. Lamoreau thinks a class like hers should be required statewide.",

    "title": "Negoziati con la FMOQ e la FMSQ: il Quebec vuole controllare le buste dei medici",
    "text": "Il ministro Dubé ha giocato venerdì una carta importante nelle trattative con i medici: il Quebec cerca di controllare fino al 40% dei loro salari, rispetto al 5% attuale, per determinare quali prestazioni saranno meglio pagate.\n“Al momento, con il modo in cui i governi precedenti hanno concesso il controllo sulle buste, non abbiamo nulla da dire su ‘chi fa cosa’ con questi soldi”, ha lamentato il ministro della Sanità in un punto stampa.\nLa gestione è lasciata “completamente alla direzione dei due sindacati” che rappresentano gli specialisti e i medici di medicina generale, afferma Christian Dubé.\nAvendo il controllo sulle buste, il Quebec spera di poter imporre tariffe differenziate, a seconda delle necessità.\n“In modo che, ad esempio, alcune specialità siano meglio pagate [et] prendiamo i soldi da altre specialità che probabilmente sono sovrapagate”, ha spiegato il ministro.\nAllo stesso tempo, il Quebec vuole poter garantire che esige “risultati associati alle nostre richieste”.\nTra gli indicatori monitorati potrebbero figurare l’assistenza domiciliare, i ritardi nella visita di uno specialista o i tempi di attesa per incontrare un medico di famiglia. «È normale che paghiamo diversamente qualcuno, un medico, che si reca in un RPA o in un CHSLD», illustra Christian Dubé.\n“Le tariffe saranno basate sui risultati”, aggiunge. È un grande cambiamento. Non è mai successo”.\nAttualmente, con il controllo solo del 5% della dotazione, la situazione è “ridicola”, ritiene il ministro. “Potremmo avere il controllo sul 30%, 40% della dotazione? Penso che stiamo parlando di questo”, dice Christian Dubé.\nSi prospettano trattative difficili\nPochi minuti dopo l’uscita del ministro, la Federazione dei medici specialisti del Quebec ha reagito con un messaggio feroce nei suoi confronti.\n“Non abbiamo tempo per rispondere ai commenti del ministro della Salute: abbiamo cose più importanti da fare”, ha scritto la federazione sulla piattaforma X. Il messaggio era accompagnato da una foto del presidente della FMSQ, il dottor Vincent Oliva, nella sala operatoria del CHUM.\nLa Federazione dei medici di medicina generale del Quebec, da parte sua, non aveva commentato al momento della pubblicazione.\nDopo il periodo delle domande, il primo ministro François Legault ha riconosciuto che il suo governo è impegnato in una dura battaglia. “Non è facile negoziare con i sindacati dei medici”, ha commentato brevemente.\nChristian Dubé, dal canto suo, durante una conferenza stampa ha dichiarato che questi negoziati potrebbero essere uno dei suoi ultimi gesti politici. “Ho detto che non ero qui per essere rieletto. Prenderò le cose come stanno, sarò esigente nei prossimi negoziati perché voglio essere esigente per i quebecchesi”, ha dichiarato.\nDisavanzo\nInoltre, il ministro ha dichiarato a parole che la risoluzione del deficit previsto di 1,5 miliardi di dollari non avverrà senza problemi.\n“Stiamo esaminando tutto per essere sicuri che ci sarà rigore di bilancio e che saremo in grado di ridurre al minimo, e lo dico, è la parola giusta, ridurre al minimo l’impatto sui servizi “, ha detto.\nIl ministro ha tuttavia cercato di ridimensionare l’entità della somma da raccogliere, su un budget che si aggira intorno ai 60 miliardi di dollari.\nHai qualche informazione da condividere con noi su questa storia?\nScrivici a o chiamaci direttamente al\n[1 800-63SCOOP.](https://www.journaldequebec.com/2024/11/29/tel:18006372667)",

    "text": "The FBI has suppressed an attack by Chinese hackers Volt Typhoon group. The concentrated attack focused on routers in an attempt to cripple Cisco and Netgear devices in small businesses and homes. The court-authorized operation prevented reinfection of the routers and removed the malware that was deployed by the hackers. ”The United States will continue to dismantle malicious cyber operations – including those sponsored by foreign governments – that undermine the security of the American people,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in a [statement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical). FBI’s Houston Field Office and Cyber Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and the National Security Cyber Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division were responsible for the successful co-ordination and delivery of the operation. FBI Director Christopher Wray said “Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide as they targeted our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors. Their pre-positioning constitutes a potential real-world threat to our physical safety that the FBI is not going to tolerate.” ”We are going to continue to work with our partners to hit the PRC hard and early whenever we see them threaten Americans.” he concluded. Disrupting the botnet The Hackers targeted a vulnerability in old routers that were near the “end of their life” according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The malware, known as “KV Botnet” had its ties severed by the co-ordinated response from the FBI. Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said that “in wiping out the KV Botnet from hundreds of routers nationwide, the Department of Justice is using all its tools to disrupt national security threats – in real-time.” The operation did not alter or compromise the devices, nor was any data collected by the response to the Chinese hacker group. The FBI has contacted the service providers of the Cisco and Netgear devices to inform them of the suppressed corruption of the devices. In other cybersecurity infrastructure news earlier this month, the [Biden Administration announced](https://readwrite.com/biden-administration-to-introduce-cybersecurity-requirements-for-hospitals/) more robust measures for U.S. hospitals. The new requirements are set to fortify digital defenses in healthcare facilities. The current administration has been dedicated to finding solutions to cybercrime and building bulwarks against invasive online criminals. Last year the White House laid [the foundations](https://readwrite.com/the-biden-administration-is-taking-steps-to-protect-your-smart-devices-from-hackers/) of a national cybersecurity certification and labeling program.
