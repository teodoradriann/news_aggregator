    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "text": "A joint operation between the Royal Thai Police and the Singapore Police Force, supported by cybersecurity firm Group-IB, has led to the arrest of a notorious cybercriminal responsible for more than 90 data leaks worldwide.\nIdentified as a 39-year-old Singaporean man named Chia, the suspect operated under multiple aliases, including ALTDOS, DESORDEN, GHOSTR, and 0mid16B, and had been actively targeting companies across Asia-Pacific, North America, the Middle East, and Europe since 2020. His cyberattacks led to the exposure and sale of over 13TB of sensitive personal and corporate data on dark web forums.\nHacker's victims across the globe\nGroup-IB Four-year investigation Group-IB's Threat Intelligence and High-Tech Crime Investigation teams, operating from their Digital Crime Resistance Centers (DCRCs) in Thailand and Singapore, had been tracking the suspect since 2020. He initially emerged under the alias ALTDOS, primarily attacking companies in Thailand before expanding his reach. His modus operandi involved hacking into corporate databases, stealing sensitive data, and demanding ransoms. If victims refused to pay, he notified media outlets or data protection regulators instead of leaking the data on the dark web, thereby intensifying reputational damage for his targets.\nOver time, the suspect evolved his tactics, adopting new aliases to avoid detection. Under DESORDEN, he gained notoriety for targeting companies in healthcare, finance, e-commerce, logistics, and retail sectors across multiple countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, and Thailand. Later, operating as GHOSTR and 0mid16B, he extended his cybercriminal activities to the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Canada, and the United States.\nChanging aliases over time\nGroup-IB Authorities confirmed that he used SQL injection tools like sqlmap and exploited vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers to gain unauthorized access. Once inside, he deployed a cracked version of Cobalt Strike to maintain control over compromised systems. Unlike many ransomware operators, he rarely engaged in lateral movement within breached networks, instead immediately exfiltrating data to rented cloud servers for blackmail purposes.\nArrest and seizure Thai authorities, led by Pol Col Panupat Kittipan, commander of the Technology Crime Suppression Subdivision 1, tracked Chia's location to a residence in Bangkok's Gusto Grand Ramkhamhaeng housing estate. Acting on a search warrant, law enforcement raided the property , seizing laptops, storage devices, and luxury goods worth an estimated 10 million baht ($280,000), allegedly purchased with profits from his cybercrime activities.\nThai police in the suspect's premises\nGroup-IB Investigators revealed that Chia used X (formerly Twitter) accounts linked to Omid16B Group to post ransom demands. He allegedly intimidated victims by directly contacting their customers through email and messaging platforms, warning them about leaked data to increase pressure on businesses. He later admitted to hacking over 70 companies, including 20 in Thailand. Among his known Thai victims was Black Canyon, a prominent coffee shop chain, whose systems were compromised in late 2024.\nThe suspect faces multiple cybercrime-related charges, including:\nUnauthorized access to protected computer systems and data Attempted extortion Illegal residence in Thailand Given the transnational nature of his crimes, authorities in Singapore and other affected countries may seek his extradition for further prosecution.",

    "text": "Subscribe to Our Newsletter\nOAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta, as part of a coalition of 22 attorneys general, filed a brief in support of a federal law that prohibits firearms dealers from selling handguns and handgun ammunition to persons under the age of 21. The case, McCoy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, is currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and addresses a Second Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(b)(1). States across the nation protect their citizens through the application of similar age-based restrictions on the possession, purchase, sale, transfer, or use of firearms because such laws have proven to promote public safety and curb gun violence within their borders.\n“Federal law has prevented federally licensed firearms retailers from selling handguns and ammunition for handguns to individuals under the age of 21 for nearly six decades,” said Attorney General Bonta. “As firearms continue to lead to more than 45,000 deaths per year, it is unwise to overturn this long-standing federal prohibition that helps reduce the scourge of gun violence in our communities. We support these federal regulations and those of sister states aimed at ending gun violence through commonsense laws that improve public safety.\"\nIn the brief, the states assert that the federal law is constitutional under the Second Amendment, as it is consistent with a historical tradition of federal and state regulations promoting gun safety and protecting communities from gun violence. The coalition argues that the district court’s decision misreads the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, which preserves federal authority to regulate firearms through laws that are “consistent with the Second Amendment’s text and historical understanding.”\nAttorney General Bonta urges the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the lower court decision because:\nAttorney General Bonta stands with partners throughout the state to continue tackling the issue of gun violence strategically and aggressively by:\nAttorney General Bonta joins the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Dealaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersy, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.\nA copy of the brief can be found\nhere.",

In Williamson County, the northwest corner of the county is now in the \"severe\" drought category, which is down from the \"extreme\" category.\nWhen looking at a statewide view of the drought, conditions have markedly improved, with all drought levels showing improving conditions. Most notably, north and east Texas, where most of the rain from the recent system fell, saw the biggest improvements statewide. The largest categorical improvement was in the \"abnormally dry\" category, where a five-percent decrease was observed. Additionally, areas not in a drought category increased by five percent as well. The \"moderate\" drought category also saw a large improvement, dropping by around 3.5% statewide.\nWith rain expected for the first week of 2024, we don't expect much change on the drought monitor for next Thursday's release, which will be the first of the new year. However, we'll be watching the monitor for January 11th, which will include next week's rainfall amounts.\nStick with KVUE for the latest as we track the potential for the drought to improve this winter with the El Nino pattern.\nIn the meantime, here's your seven-day forecast.",

    "text": "AFP Salvador: la face obscure de la \"guerre contre les gangs\" de Bukele Lire l'article complet María Isabel Sánchez 2 février 2024 à 0:52 AM Des détenus dans une cellule de la méga-prison du Centre de confinement contre le terrorisme (CECOT), le 21 août 2023 à Tecoluca, au Salvador (Marvin RECINOS) Quelque 75.000 personnes ont été emprisonnées au Salvador dans le cadre de l'état d'urgence en vigueur depuis mars 2022. Si 7.000 ont été innocentées depuis, nombreuses seraient encore derrière les barreaux sans preuves, selon des ONG, dévoilant la face obscure de la \"guerre contre les gangs\" du président Nayib Bukele.\nSi la criminalité s'est effondrée dans le pays d'Amérique centrale, des organisations de défense de droits humains comme Amnesty international ou au Salvador le Mouvement des victimes du régime (Movir), dénoncent détentions arbitraires, mauvais traitements, cas de torture et même des décès dans les prisons.\n\"Certaines arrestations étaient fondées sur le seul fait que les personnes concernées avaient des tatouages, un casier judiciaire ou vivaient dans une zone contrôlée par des gangs\", dit Amnesty dans son rapport de décembre 2023.\nSandra, Maricela, Josefina et Irma, mères ou grand-mères de familles ayant en commun de vivre dans une extrême pauvreté, affirment à l'AFP que leurs proches sont des victimes innocentes des dérives de l'état d'urgence.\n- \"Des innocents meurent\" -\nSandra Hernandez, 36 ans, mère de deux enfants de 17 et 13 ans, raconte dans sa maison sans eau ni électricité, à 50 km de San Salvador, l'arrestation de son mari, le 26 mai 2022.\n\"Ils l'ont accusé d'appartenance à un gang. Il n'avait pas de tatouages\", assure-t-elle. En prison, José Medrano est tombé malade, souffrant d'insuffisance rénale.\nLa dernière fois que Sandra Hernandez et ses enfants l'ont vu, c'est lors d'un appel vidéo au moment de son transfert à l'hôpital pour une hémodialyse. Il y décédera le 26 mars 2023. \"Des innocents meurent, pas les membres des gangs (...) Ce qu'ils ont fait, c'est instaurer la terreur, et ce sont les pauvres gens qui tombent\", fustige-t-elle.\n- \"Peur qu'ils m'emmènent\" -\nLire la suite Maricela Méndez raconte avoir été arrêtée chez elle, à Alta Vista, dans le nord-est de San Salvador, le 19 juillet 2022 et ses enfants alors âgés de 11 et 7 ans confiés à leur grand-mère.\n\"Ils m'ont accusée d'être une délinquante du quartier, la police avait un quota de cinq arrestations\", affirme-t-elle estimant avoir été dénoncée sans preuves par des voisins.\nElle a séjourné dans trois prisons, dormant à même le sol, nourrie de simples galettes de maïs et d'eau sucrée. \"Ils nous punissaient, nous battaient, ne nous donnaient pas d'eau\". Enceinte lors de son arrestation, elle a obtenu une libération conditionnelle deux mois avant l'accouchement. A sa sortie, son mari l'avait quittée.\nCette mère de 35 ans qui travaille dans un salon de beauté dit ses enfants \"traumatisés\". \"Lorsqu'ils voient une patrouille de police, ils pleurent, ils ont peur qu'ils m'emmènent à nouveau. Je ressens la même peur\".\n- \"Ils n'enquêtent pas\" -\nLes yeux gonflés d'avoir mal dormi à côté du berceau où se reposent ses petits-enfants de deux et trois ans et demi, Josefina Bonilla essuie ses larmes.\nElle dit n'avoir \"pas de nouvelles\" de sa fille Stefany Santos, 24 ans, arrêtée le 2 juin 2022. La grand-mère évoque un conflit avec la famille du père, assassiné pour un problème de dettes.\n\"Elle est innocente. Ils arrêtent des gens et n'enquêtent pas\", affirme-t-elle dans sa modeste maison de Soyapango, disant vivre grâce à l'aide de voisins.\n\"Ma fille est asthmatique et a des problèmes psychologiques. Je suis inquiète qu'elle n'ait pas de médicaments\", se lamente-t-elle, déplorant qu'en un an et demi, elle n'ait pu lui apporter que trois colis de nourriture et de vêtements.\n- Avenir \"volé\" -\nIrma Garcia, 42 ans, dit vouloir parler pour ne plus se sentir \"impuissante\" après l'arrestation de son fils, bientôt 18 ans ce 7 juin 2022, dans l'atelier de mécanique où il travaillait.\n\"Depuis qu'ils l'ont emmené, je ne l'ai plus vu. Je ne sais pas s'il va bien, s'il est vivant\", dit-elle dans sa chambre à Mejicanos, au nord de San Salvador.\n\"Mon fils n'est pas membre d'un gang, il n'a pas de tatouages, il n'a fait de mal à personne\", assure-t-elle, évoquant une dénonciation anonyme.\n\"Ils arrêtent des jeunes innocents, ils volent leurs rêves, leur avenir, comme celui de mon fils\", se lamente cette veuve, mère de trois autres enfants de 13, 15 et 21 ans qui dit vivre \"avec l'inquiétude qu'on me dise qu'il a été tué\".\nmis/lab/sf/pz\nTENDANCE Kate Middleton : on connaît enfin la vraie raison de tout ce mystère autour de son opération Closer Gabriel Attal moqué par Florence Foresti : le Premier ministre réplique Purepeople Andréa Bescond règle ses comptes avec Gérard Depardieu dans Télématin : \"On ne parle pas de consentement quand la victime a 40 ans de moins\" (VIDÉO) Programme TV Agriculteurs en colère : Ségolène Royal dénonce une arnaque sur BFMTV et se fait recadrer Purebreak Rima Abdul Malak remplacée par Rachida Dati, cette décision qu'elle a prise avant son départ du ministère de la Culture Purepeople",
