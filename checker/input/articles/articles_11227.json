The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has warned a severe geomagnetic storm could cause power outages and disrupt GPS and communications right around the country across the weekend. In a warning issued on Friday morning, the bureau's Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre said a level G4 storm – the second-highest classification – was set to impact from roughly 8pm on Friday and weaken through the weekend. \"The warning issued for this event informs government and critical infrastructure operators so they can take action to mitigate potential impacts on infrastructure assets and essential service,\" the BoM said. Forecasters warned the storm had the potential to disrupt \"critical infrastructure such as power grids, causing power outages\" and \"satellite services, affecting communications and global position, navigation and timing services that use high-frequency radio communication\". A power outage in Sydney left thousands in Newtown without power for hours on Friday night but it was unclear if there was any link to the solar activity. Bright auroras would be visible at unusually low latitudes, including dark areas near Sydney and Perth, if G4 conditions were reached, the bureau said. Conditions are expected to reduce to G3 on Saturday and continue until about 6am on Sunday, plus or minus about 10 hours. \"The G-scale is a measure of global geomagnetic activity, which refers to fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field across the globe. The G-scale ranges from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme),\" the bureau said. It's caused by at least four mass ejections from the sun, which took place from Wednesday afternoon until Thursday night. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a similar warning, saying it was the first G4 watch since 2005. \"Several strong flares have been observed over the past few days and were associated with a large and magnetically complex sunspot cluster … , which is 16 times the diameter of Earth,\" the forecaster's space weather centre said. It described the ejections as \"explosions of plasma and magnetic fields from the sun's corona\". NASA shared colourised videos of two flares ejected from the sun on Wednesday with a similar warning about the potential for disruption. \"The Sun—like even the most vibrant people—is not a constant ray of sunshine,\" the space agency said. \"It constantly cycles through periods of higher and lower activity. High activity can lead to these solar flares, or dramatic explosions of energy out from the Sun.\"",
