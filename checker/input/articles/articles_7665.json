All rights reserved. 6 dead, including 2 children, from wrong-way, head-on collision in Texas: 'Devastating scene and very emotional' December 28, 2023 Six people are dead, including two children, after a deadly car crash in Texas on Tuesday afternoon. Police noted that the fatal car accident left a \"devastating scene\" and has been very emotional for responding officers. A preliminary investigation found that a white 2014 Chevrolet Silverado was traveling southbound on U.S. Highway 67 when the pickup truck entered the northbound lane in a no-passing zone. The Silverado smashed into a Honda Odyssey minivan in a head-on collision, according to a statement posted by the Johnson County Sheriff's Office on its official The devastating car crash resulted in \"heavy damage\" to both vehicles, just west of Cleburne, approximately 30 miles south of Fort Worth, Texas. The highway was closed for hours as investigators processed the crash site. The driver and passenger of the Chevy pickup truck — both 17-year-olds from Glen Rose — were traveling the wrong way on the highway and experienced injuries from the collision. The teenagers were transported to Fort Worth hospitals in critical condition. However, the people in the minivan suffered horrific fates in the deadly car accident . The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the six people traveling in the Odyssey minivan who perished in the car collision: 28-year-old driver Rushil Barri, 36-year-old Naveena Potabathula, 64-year-old Nageswararao Ponnada, 60-year-old Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada, 10-year-old Krithik Potabathula, and 9-year-old Nishidha Potabathula. A 26-year-old male from Georgia was critically injured and rushed to a local hospital. All but one of the deceased are residents of Alpharetta, Georgia. The 28-year-old driver was from Irving, Texas. The Telugu Association of North America said all of the adults in the minivan emigrated from India to the United States, according to Fox News . \"It’s so hard to take. He’s my half. He’s my half,\" Rakesh Barri, Rushil Barri’s brother, told WFAA-TV . The Johnson County Sheriff's Office said in a statement, \"Please say a prayer for the families of the deceased and injured. Also, please pray for our Deputies, Troopers, and all other first responders working this accident.

    "text": "Campaign also launches to address growing issue of excessive heat in workplaces\nNewfoundland and Labrador is ensuring that both companies and employees are aware of workers’ rights.\nThe \"Your Rights at Work\" campaign aims to help employers understand their responsibilities under provincial labour legislation, while also informing workers—particularly young and non-unionized employees—of their rights in the workplace.\n“Every year, thousands of young people enter the workforce for the first time. It is important that they understand their rights and protections under the Labour Standards Act, and that employers are equally informed of their responsibilities. This campaign is about raising awareness and ensuring both workers and employers know where to go for accurate information and support,” said Pam Parsons, Minister of Labour.\n“With more than 25,000 non-unionized workers aged 15 to 24 in Newfoundland and Labrador, this campaign is designed to reach this demographic through printed materials and a series of social media posts to help build fair and informed workplaces.”\nThe Labour Standards Act is designed to provide protection to individual workers while requiring employers to establish conditions of employment that meet at least the legislated minimum standards for their employees.\nUpdated booklet on labour standards\nAs part of the campaign, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador has released an updated Labour Standards booklet that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both employees and employers under the act.\nThe booklet—available online here—will also be available in print at employment centres throughout the province. To further raise awareness, posters and bookmarks will also be distributed to employment centres and schools, said the provincial government.\nInterested parties can also request a copy of the Your Rights at Work booklet by contacting Labour Standards at (877) 563-1063 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c406d6e63797e5f786d62686d7e687f4c6b637a226260226f6d).\nIn late 2024, Newfoundland and Labrador’s government announced proposed changes to its Labour Standards Act that would significantly strengthen job-protected leave for employees facing serious health issues, injuries, or those who serve in the military.\nHeat stress campaign\nIn July, the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour (NLFL) also launched a workplace heat stress campaign to address the growing issue of excessive heat in workplaces.\n“Heat exposure is a life-threatening occupational hazard with serious short- and long-term consequences – and it can escalate dangerously fast,” said NLFL President Jessica McCormick. “As our planet warms, heat stress is becoming a workplace crisis within the broader climate crisis. Workers must know their rights, employers must take immediate action to protect them, and governments must implement strong policies to ensure worker safety.”\nThe campaign focuses on three key priorities:\n- Educating workers on the signs and dangers of heat stress, as well as their legal rights to a safe workplace;\n- Collecting worker experiences through an online survey and a “Share Your Story” form to document how heat impacts their health and their work; and\n- Demanding action from employers and governments to implement stronger protections against extreme heat.\n“This summer, we’ll be engaging with workers, on the ground and online, to hear firsthand how heat stress affects them, how the situation has changed in recent years, whether employers are taking proper precautions, and what more must be done to keep workers safe,” said McCormick. “Many workers in our province face extreme heat at work, whether indoors or outdoors, and the situation will only get worse as climate change makes our summers hotter. The information we gather and the conversations we have will drive our fight for change.”\nIn mid-2024, workers at a huge power plant in Newfoundland and Labrador were evacuated as a wildfire raged within the province.",

    "text": "[James Rodríguez](/temas/james-rodriguez) El reconocimiento que la FIFA le hizo al futbolista colombiano James Rodríguez: “Volvió a brillar” El centrocampista James Rodríguez, es uno de los futbolistas referentes, no solo de la selección Colombia, sino también para las jóvenes promesas del deporte en su país. La carrera del colombiano, de 32 años, ha estado marcada por altibajos dentro y fuera de la cancha que lo han mantenido como el foco principal de los distintos medios de comunicación en el mundo. Sin embargo, su importancia y experiencia en el combinado ‘Tricolor’ ha sido significativo para muchos, pues mientras que algunos dudaban de su capacidad para volver a portar los colores de la selección, hubo alguien que creyó en él: Néstor Lorenzo. Así lo considera la [ Federación Internacional de Fútbol Asociación (FIFA)](https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/es/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/articles/el-renacimiento-de-james-rodriguez-la-bendicion-de-lorenzo-que-salio-bien)que dedicó un artículo al cucuteño y reconoció el papel que ha tenido en la selección en las eliminatorias para el Mundial 2026. Para poder resaltar el papel de James, el ente rector del fútbol mundial puso de ejemplo a los astros argentinos: Diego Armando Maradona y Juan Román Riquelme. “En 1994, Diego Maradona jugó el 16 de junio de 1994 su primer partido de la Copa Mundial de Estados Unidos como jugador libre. Su último encuentro había sido unos seis meses antes (2 de diciembre de 1993, ante Huracán), con la camiseta de Newell's, en un paso que hizo volar la fantasía de miles de hinchas rosarinos, pero que no terminó de aceitarse”, inicia diciendo la FIFA en su artículo. La entidad continuó diciendo que: “En las Eliminatorias rumbo al Mundial 2010, Juan Román Riquelme era la bandera de la Selección argentina que dirigía Alfio Basile, pese a que llevaba varios meses sin jugar en Villarreal, distanciado con el cuerpo técnico que dirigía Manuel Pellgrini. Muchos recuerdan los dos golazos de tiro libre que le marcó a Chile en el estadio Monumental, un partido al que el 10 argentino llegaba con tres meses sin jugar un partido, siendo el último la final de la Copa América 2007”. La FIFA empieza a hablar de James mencionando el llamado del colombiano a la selección en septiembre de 2022 para disputar los amistosos contra Guatemala y México. “El 10 recién se había desvinculado del Al-Rayyan, de Qatar, y firmado con Olympiacos, de Grecia. Había tenido unos minutos el 7 de septiembre y antes de eso había visto acción recién en marzo. Las críticas negativas llovieron como una tormenta imparable”. Sin embargo, para la Federación Internacional de Fútbol Asociación el centrocampista del Sao Paulo hace parte de un selecto grupo de jugadores que cuentan con “talentos, con una entidad especial, con un registro que crea contextos a favor que otros no pueden alcanzar”. Y dichas características fueron vistas por Néstor Lorenzo, quien en la primera convocatoria explicó que James “es un jugador que le ha dado mucho al fútbol colombiano”, además de que, en ese entonces, lo notó “con mucho compromiso y ganas de estar y brindarse de lleno en la Selección”. Pese a las críticas que venía recibiendo James, por fin las cosas empezaron a mejorar, y un año después “la tormenta pasó de largo, salió el sol y el pronóstico no advierte casi ninguna nube”. “La Selección Colombia tiene 12 puntos y ocupa el tercer lugar de las Eliminatorias sudamericanas rumbo a la Copa Mundial de la FIFA 2026, dos puntos abajo de Argentina y uno de Uruguay”, añadió. La FIFA expresó también que James en los últimos encuentros que disputó con la selección “volvió a brillar como en las viejas -buenas- épocas”. El ente rector del fútbol en el mundo también destacó la capacidad de Lorenzo de continuar llamando a jugadores que brillaron en la ‘era Pekerman’. “Le tiene un cariño especial y así lo hace saber. Pero, además, Lorenzo parece impregnado por la generación de jugadores que brillaron en la era de Pekerman (…) Lorenzo no solo respeta la historia. La abraza”, concluye.",

    "text": "A l'occasion d'un entretien téléphonique samedi à l'avant-veille de Noël avec le cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, le président français a évoqué \"sa vive préoccupation face à la situation dramatique de la paroisse latine de Gaza\", où \"des centaines de civils de toutes confessions (...) vivent sous les bombes et les balles depuis plus de deux mois tandis que les fidèles et les sœurs y prennent soin de personnes malades, âgées ou handicapées\". Il a fait part de ses condoléances \"pour la mort de deux paroissiennes, tuées de manière indigne il y a quelques jours\". Le 16 décembre, une mère et sa fille, toutes deux chrétiennes, ont été tuées par un soldat israélien sur le parvis de la seule église catholique de Gaza. Le pape François a dénoncé le lendemain la mort de ces deux femmes. Un message de paix Dans la perspective de la messe de Noël, en l’église de la Nativité à Bethléem, Emmanuel Macron a demandé au patriarche latin \"d’adresser un message de paix et de solidarité à tous les Chrétiens de Terre Sainte, et de les assurer que la France se tient à leurs côtés\". Le président a réaffirmé \"la fidélité de la France à ses engagements, et notamment au rôle particulier de protection d'un certain nombre de communautés chrétiennes, exercé à travers le consulat général de France à Jérusalem\". \"Cette responsabilité, héritée de l'histoire, sera pleinement assumée face aux risques contemporains qui pèsent sur ces communautés\", a assuré M. Macron qui a envoyé parallèlement un message de \"soutien\" et de \"solidarité\" aux communautés chrétiennes, via le consulat de France à Jérusalem.
