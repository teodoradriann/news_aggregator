    "title": "‘Bonga: Shell To Deepen Investments In Deep Water, Gas, Renewables’",
    "text": "“Bonga produced 1 billion barrels of oil last year and SNEPCo has stepped up efforts for additional volumes from existing assets with more to come on stream in 2024 and beyond. Other opportunities in deep water include the Bonga North, Bonga South-West and Nnwa Doro projects on which SNEPCo is collaborating with the Nigerian government and partners to implement. Shell is also expanding its gas portfolio with both SNEPCo and The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) maturing several projects to deliver gas from their onshore and deep-water assets,” she said. For its part, Shell Nigeria Gas said it is currently serving more than 130 industrial and commercial customers and looks to expand its gas distribution network to deliver over 1,000MW equivalent of energy to industrial parks and manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Aiboni explained investments in renewables: “Off-grid solutions are the quickest way to improve energy access in remote communities, so our investments in this area will provide millions of Nigerians access to reliable and sustainable electricity. Shell Nigeria is driving uptake in renewable energy through two companies — All On and Daystar Power Solutions. All On has facilitated more than 80,000 off-grid connections in Nigeria’s 36 states, including the federal capital territory, with nearly 200 underserved communities and 560 new businesses powered with clean energy. Daystar plans to increase its installed solar capacity to 400MW by 2025 to become one of Africa’s leading providers of solar power solutions for commercial and industrial businesses”. She added: “Over the years, Shell has proved to be a reliable partner in the development of Nigeria through our range of business and mainly the energy we produce. We will continue to look for innovative ways to help reduce costs and drive efficiency in our business. We want to remain highly competitive and relevant in the oil and gas business and still stand tall despite all the challenges.”",

    "title": "New York's Luxe Coastal Italian Restaurant Marea Splashes Into Beverly Hills",
    "text": "One of the best Italian seafood restaurants in New York City, Marea, opened January 16, 2025, in a sleek Beverly Hills space along Camden Drive, where stalwarts Mr. Chow, Cipriani, and Gravitas already serve a well-heeled dining crowd. Marea first opened on Columbus Circle in May 2009, a jolt to the wallet amid the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis, serving upscale crudo, extruded pasta, and its signature sauteed Dover sole. Marea’s arrival in Beverly Hills — one of Los Angeles’s most anticipated restaurants of 2025 — marks the first expansion for the prolific Altamarea restaurant group, which owns Ai Fiori, Morini, and Fifty Three in Manhattan, in addition to restaurants in U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and India.\nOn one of its preview nights last week, suits, cocktail dresses, and fur coats were dominant motifs in the Italian restaurant’s wood-paneled dining room. A glowing honey onyx-backed cocktail bar and lounge reside to the left of the entrance; its front patio will become a regular paparazzi haunt once the weather warms up. Marea has always been a celebrated restaurant, earning the James Beard Best New Restaurant Award in 2010, two Michelin stars (which it has since lost), a positive review from former Eater New York critic Ryan Sutton, and the distinction of being one of the late Anthony Bourdain’s favorite places to eat in New York. Marea’s founding chef Michael White parted from the company in 2021, with PJ Calapa taking over as executive chef for both New York and here in Beverly Hills.\nOne could argue that Marea helped birth an entire generation of ritzy coastal Italian seafood restaurants across the country, including now-closed Cal Mare, Viale dei Romani, Sirena, and Sparrow. Coastal Italian hideaways Capri at Eataly in Century City and Hearts & Flame in Arts District remain open.\nTo best get a sense of Marea’s magic, read through former New York Times critic Sam Sifton’s review from 2009, where he lauds the lardo-topped uni toast, lobster over burrata, and red wine-braised octopus fusilli laced with bone marrow. Those dishes, and many more, remain on the menu at its Los Angeles location. A crudo sampler could include dainty slices of mackerel, yellowfin tuna, and Baja kanpachi dressed with colatura. Classic grilled octopus legs are assembled over tiny smoked potatoes and tonnato sauce. The pasta portions are ample, large enough for two or even three to easily share, like rolled gnochetti with plump ruby shrimp pieces. Most tables are keen to order pan-seared Dover sole, served with a lemon sauce, plus the option for four toppings for an additional price (think French-style meunière or Kaluga caviar and butter). Other entrees include grilled Wagyu strip loin or whole seared langoustines.\nMarea has a full-time pastry chef who delivers Michelin-worthy desserts (which makes sense given its prior two-star rating). Noce di cocco comes as a light meringue wedge topped with paper-thin pineapple slices, tangy passion fruit sauce, borage flowers, edible gold, and a quenelle of coconut ice cream. A chocolate-capped tiramisu molded into the shape of a coffee bean comes with mascarpone gelato. A few petit fours — mini macarons, pate de fruit, and a dark, glossy chocolate truffle — come with the check. From start to finish, the restaurant’s seamless, almost effortless luxury abounds.\nMarea is open daily from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. at 430 North Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, CA, 90210. Reservations are available on SevenRooms.",

El director de la Coordinación Estatal de Protección Civil (CEPC) indicó que para este próximo domingo se espera el ingreso de un nuevo frente frío que provocará la tercera tormenta invernal de la temporada. “Va afectar específicamente al Noroeste y al Norte del estado de Sonora, algunos municipios del Sur y lo que vendría siendo ya la Sierra Alta y los municipios del Río Sonora”, declaró. El domingo será cuando se presente un canal de baja presión que en conjunto con el ingreso del frente frío generará la tercera tormenta invernal. “En vez de traernos daños y riesgos a la población es benéfico porque nos va a traer presencia de lluvias para todo lo que viene siendo Norte y Noroeste del estado, la Sierra Alta y de igual manera en el Río Sonora y algunas partes del Centro”, dijo.
