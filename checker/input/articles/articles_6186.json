    "title": "Over 500 flights delayed, 24 train ops hit in Delhi amid dense fog | India News - Business Standard",
    "text": "More than 500 flights, including departures and arrivals, and 24 trains departing from Delhi were delayed on Friday amid dense fog. According to flightradar24 data, till 5.30 pm on Friday, about 145 arrivals were delayed at the national capital’s airport. Moreover, about 394 departures were also delayed at this airport. In a statement on Friday morning, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that “very dense” fog was reported at Palam airport, which adjoins the Delhi International Airport. “Palam airport recorded the lowest visibility 0 metres from 8 am to 9.30 am which thereafter improved and became 50 metres at 10 am...Mainly moderate fog conditions with wind speed less than four kilometers per hour variable direction prevailed over the region in the forenoon on Friday,” the IMD noted.

However, there has been no impact on flight operations. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for the updated flight information.” DIAL did not release any information about the number of flights delayed or cancelled due to fog. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, IndiGo is the largest airline operator at the Delhi airport with about 500 daily flights. Air India is the second largest operator at Delhi airport with about 435 daily flights. SpiceJet operates about 72 daily flights to and from the airport. IndiGo stated on X on Friday morning that “another foggy morning\" is expected for Delhi, Bengaluru, and Lucknow. “We advise you to monitor your flight status before starting your journey. Additionally, please allow extra time when travelling to the airport, as reduced visibility might affect vehicle movement,” it added. SpiceJet had stated on X on Monday morning that due to poor visibility at Delhi airport, all departures and arrivals and their consequential flights might get affected. “Passengers are requested to keep a check on their flight status,” it added. On the morning of Friday, 24 trains departing from Delhi were reportedly delayed after dense fog engulfed the national capital. Some of these, such as the Brahmaputra Express, were delayed by around four hours due to zero visibility. Similarly, Gorakh Express, Mahabodhi Express and Bihar Kranti Express, among others, also saw significant delays on account of the conditions. The Indian Railways has been installing fog safety devices, which are GPS-based navigation tools, in trains to ensure visibility even during dense fog. In December, the railway ministry had said that it had installed close to 20,000 fog safety devices in locomotives. Additionally, indigenous automatic train protection system Kavach is also expected to allow loco pilots to pass through foggy areas with relative ease. On November 20, Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu had told the airlines to ensure that all check-in counters at Delhi airport are fully staffed to minimise passenger inconvenience as fog and smog started affecting the flight operations. The minister had given this direction during a meeting with representatives of major airlines, DIAL, officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The meeting was called on November 20 to assess readiness of the aviation ecosystem amid the “early onset of fog/smog” in Delhi. More than 370 flights, including departures as well as arrivals, were delayed at Delhi airport on November 18 due to dense fog and pollution.

    "title": "Tennis-Ukraine's Tsurenko perseveres with painful reminders of war",
    "text": "By Shrivathsa Sridhar\nMELBOURNE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Stepping onto a tennis court to take on a Russian or Belarusian opponent is a painful reminder for Ukraine's Lesia Tsurenko of her war-torn country, the 34-year-old said after losing to second seed Aryna Sabalenka at the Australian Open on Friday.\nAlmost two years after the Russian invasion, which Moscow called a special military operation, Ukrainian players do not shake hands with Russian or Belarussian opponents at the end of matches. Belarus supports Russia's invasion and allowed Moscow to use its territory to launch the war.\nTsurenko avoided the customary post-match ritual after being thumped 6-0 6-0 by Belarusian Sabalenka in the third round on Friday and explained that it had become a \"national position\" she would not stray from.\n\"It's very hard for me,\" Tsurenko told reporters about going up against Russian and Belarusian players.\n\"I know where they're from, this is another reminder for me and it's painful,\" she said.\n\"They're part of that ... war machine hurting my country and my people. This is tough for me but I'm trying to find happiness in everything that I do and go and hit the yellow ball.\"\nTsurenko hopes her actions will keep the focus on the war.\n\"People don't want to talk about war. People don't want to hear bad news. I get a lot of bad messages on social media,\" she said. \"People are annoyed if I post something.\n\"But it's very tough to explain if you don't feel what I feel and how other Ukrainians feel.\"\nSabalenka said the position of Ukrainian players was well established on the tennis tour.\n\"I understand everyone's position and I respect everyone's position,\" she said after the match. \"She was quite respectful. She said 'great play'. She didn't shake my hand, but she was respectful to me, so I appreciate that.\"\nA seasoned professional on the women's tour, Tsurenko said she had good relationships with Russian and Belarusian players before the war, but that was now impossible.\n\"I don't have respect for the fact that for most of them it was impossible to come and say that they don't agree with what's going on in my country ... 99% of them never did,\" she said.\n\"Why should I have any relationship with them?\"\nThe world number 33 said she had become used to beginning her days checking for news from Ukraine.\n\"Unfortunately this is part of my life. It's a hard thing to say, but I got used to it. It's horrible to get used to the fact that there's a war in your country and it'll not stop tomorrow,\" Tsurenko said.\n\"I worked a lot with a psychologist and it took me a few months, probably, to get some kind of recipe for myself on how to live and continue playing.\n\"I feel so many things that were important to me aren't anymore, like a tennis match. I don't feel I really care about how I finish a match or what the score is.\n\"I care more about the fact that I can be here and remind the world that the war is still on. I care about the fact that I can earn some money, donate it and help people.\"\n(Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Melbourne; Editing by Neil Fullick)\n(( ;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

(Photo d'archives) Photo : La Presse canadienne / Sean Kilpatrick Environnement Canada a émis des avertissements de chaleur pour tout l'ouest du Québec et la majeure partie de l'est de l'Ontario jeudi et vendredi. Selon Environnement Canada, les températures diurnes pourraient atteindre 32 °C d'ici la fin de la semaine, avec un indice humidex de près de 40. Les températures minimales nocturnes pourraient rester supérieures à 20 °C. Environnement Canada s'attend à un samedi et un dimanche chauds et humides dans l'ouest du Québec. Ils sont moins sûrs pour la région d'Ottawa, disant qu'il pourrait en être ainsi au cours de ces deux jours. À Ottawa, la température relevée jeudi à 10 h à l'aéroport international était déjà de 26,5 °C, soit la moyenne pour un 1er août. L'humidité a donné l'impression qu'il faisait 36, puis 40 à 15 h. L'humidité pourrait se dissiper brièvement au cours de la nuit. Vendredi et samedi, les températures maximales devraient être similaires, puis dimanche, elles seront de 26 °C. Juillet est le huitième mois consécutif au cours duquel Ottawa a connu une température moyenne supérieure à la norme établie dans les années 1980, 1990 et 2000. À lire aussi : Des risques pour la santé Environnement Canada rappelle que les fortes chaleurs peuvent présenter des risques importants pour la santé de tous, certains groupes étant particulièrement vulnérables, dont les personnes âgées, les nourrissons et les jeunes enfants, les femmes enceintes et les personnes souffrant de troubles physiques ou mentaux. Santé publique Ottawa propose sur son site web une carte interactive identifiant des endroits où rester au frais dans toute la ville, notamment les piscines, les bibliothèques, les pataugeoires et les centres communautaires, ainsi que les fontaines. Il est demandé à tous d'éviter de faire de l'exercice pendant les pics de chaleur, de rester à l'intérieur lorsque c'est possible – en particulier dans les espaces qui sont refroidis – et de boire beaucoup de liquides.

    "text": "Well, that sucked. [Tottenham](https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com) went south to Brighton on a three match winning streak, but without their only healthy recognized central defender in Cuti Romero, who tweaked his hamstring and is out until the end of January. The idea was that Spurs could get a good result at a tough place to play. Instead they got pumped. Tottenham gave up two penalties (both converted by Joao Pedro) and goals to Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinian. Tottenham made it interesting late thanks to goals from Alejo Veliz (his first in a Spurs shirt!) and Ben Davies, but couldn’t overcome that early deficit. In truth, it was a pretty putrid performance. And now — It’s time to rate the players. Rate the players from 1⁄2 to 5 stars. If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK. I will round the stars up/down to the nearest half-star for the player ratings later this week.
