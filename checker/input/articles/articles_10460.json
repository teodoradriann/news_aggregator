    "text": "JACKSON COUNTY - Omnia Group Ashland and Heroic Hearts Project have teamed up to help bring free or reduced cost psilocybin experiences to our veterans. Drew Snyder is a veteran who was diagnosed with PTSD and said he's benefited from psilocybin treatment. Snyder experienced tremendous anxiety and stress. He said he was a wreck and pursued a lot of therapy. The VA provided options for treatment and provided medication to make him feel functional but as Snyder described it, “not the person I wanted to be for my family, for my wife and kids... I was a wreck.” Now he is a licensed counselor and a licensed psilocybin facilitator. Listen here for the full interview. Omnia and HHP will hold a fundraiser Saturday April 6, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Dr. Zach Skiles will be the keynote speaker starting at 5:45 p.m. The event will be held at 607 Siskiyou Blvd, Ashland OR 97520 The event invites residents to support the program and bring relief to veterans who served our country. It provides an opportunity for people to learn about the possibilities of psilocybin supported services for veterans.",

    "title": "The B-2 Spirit: Unveiling the Most Expensive Aircraft in the US Military",
    "text": "The Most Expensive Aircraft of the US Military: Unveiling the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber\nIn the realm of military aviation, the United States reigns supreme, boasting an arsenal of cutting-edge aircraft that push the boundaries of technology and innovation. Among these remarkable machines, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber stands out as a true marvel of engineering and a symbol of American military prowess. With a staggering price tag of $737 million per unit, the B-2 Spirit is not just the most expensive aircraft in the US military’s inventory; it’s a testament to the nation’s commitment to maintaining air superiority and strategic deterrence.\nA Technological Masterpiece:\nThe B-2 Spirit is a product of Northrop Grumman’s visionary design and engineering expertise. It’s a flying wing aircraft, meaning it lacks a distinct fuselage and instead features a blended wing-body design that seamlessly integrates the aircraft’s body with its wings. This unique configuration, coupled with advanced stealth technology, makes the B-2 virtually undetectable by radar, infrared, and electromagnetic sensors. It’s a true testament to the ingenuity and technological prowess of American engineers.\nDesigned for Stealth and Precision:\nThe B-2 Spirit’s primary mission is to penetrate deep into enemy territory and deliver a devastating payload of nuclear or conventional weapons with unmatched precision. Its stealth capabilities allow it to evade detection, making it an ideal platform for high-risk missions that require surgical strike capabilities. The aircraft’s advanced avionics and navigation systems ensure pinpoint accuracy, enabling it to strike targets with devastating precision.\nA Force Multiplier:\nThe B-2 Spirit’s capabilities extend beyond its stealth and strike capabilities. It serves as a force multiplier, enhancing the effectiveness of other military assets. By disrupting enemy air defenses and neutralizing critical targets, the B-2 Spirit paves the way for other aircraft and ground forces to operate with greater freedom and effectiveness. Its presence in a combat zone can significantly alter the balance of power and provide a decisive advantage to the US military.\nA Symbol of American Air Power:\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber stands as a symbol of American air power and technological dominance. Its high cost is justified by its unparalleled capabilities and the strategic advantage it provides to the United States. As the US military continues to evolve and face new challenges, the B-2 Spirit remains a vital asset, ensuring America’s ability to project power and maintain global security.\nAdditional Notes:\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber made its maiden flight in 1989 and entered service in 1997. It has a wingspan of 172 feet and a length of 69 feet. The B-2 Spirit is powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 turbofan engines, each producing 33,000 pounds of thrust. It has a maximum speed of Mach 0.95 (630 mph) and a range of over 6,000 miles. The B-2 Spirit can carry up to 40,000 pounds of weapons in its internal weapons bay. Conclusion:\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber stands as a testament to American engineering brilliance and military might. Its high cost is a reflection of its exceptional capabilities and the strategic advantage it provides to the United States. As the world continues to witness the evolution of military aviation, the B-2 Spirit remains a symbol of American air power and a force to be reckoned with in the skies.",

    "text": "Natalie Lung | (TNS) Bloomberg News\nAirbnb Inc. launched a new section of its app and website where homeowners can hire fellow hosts to manage their rentals, underscoring a broader push to increase listings and attract more people to the platform.\nThe idea is that hosts who may not have the time or inclination to be hands-on can pay preapproved “co-hosts” on the platform to help set up or furnish their listings, or manage their bookings and guests. Airbnb has already received applications from would-be co-hosts, whom the company vets based on criteria indicating a strong track record, such as the number of stays they’ve hosted, ratings from guests and low cancellation rates.\nA co-host can offer as many as 10 different types of services, with different compensation options that include, say, charging a one-time fee for setting up a listing page, or a percentage of a booking for day-to-day support. The new “co-host network” is launching in 10 countries including the U.S., Canada, UK, France, Spain and Brazil, the company said on Wednesday. It already has 10,000 co-hosts to start, with an average rating of 4.86 out of 5.\nInvestors are eager for details about new platform features that Airbnb has said will introduce new opportunities for revenue growth, which has slowed following an initial post-pandemic travel boom. On that metric, analysts estimate moderate, single-digit gains in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.\nAirbnb does not take a commission when it connects hosts, the company said.\n“It’s this nice positive flywheel that benefits Airbnb overall, so there’s no need to take an additional cut,” Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson said in an interview ahead of the release. “What we’ll do is benefit by having more people stay in Airbnb because they’re going to all have more better stays.”\nRelated Articles Google monopoly: Prosecutors hint at company breakup, but analysts say it’s unlikely Will schools start using AI surveillance cameras with facial recognition?

The firm similarly unveiled new personalized search filters for guests inspired by their past stays to make it easier to find properties with their preferred amenities. It also simplified the checkout page for guests, and added more local payment methods in various countries, with a goal to nearly double the number of options to almost 40 by spring 2025. The benefits of these smaller changes will be “additive and accretive over time,” Stephenson said.\nChief Executive Officer Brian Chesky previously told investors that the company will next year re-start its Experiences business for tours, classes and workshops, with better marketing and more affordable prices. The firm has also been investing more into less mature markets overseas, including the introduction of limited-edition stays inspired by local cultural icons. Additionally, Stephenson has teased new guest-related services for next year, such as personal chefs, midweek cleaning and in-home massages.\nBut it will take time for Airbnb to see a return on these investments. The company has said it expects marketing expenses to grow faster than revenue in the third quarter as it expands into new regions and adds services beyond its core offering of home rentals, all of which will likely weigh on margins in the near term.\nThese new initiatives “might not be the answer to reinvigorate the core top line” as novel features “will take time to ramp up,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in an Aug. 9 note.\n___\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

    "text": "16:58 News Story Biden administration sanctions ‘extremist’ Israeli settlers in West Bank A general view over the Gaza Strip as seen from the Israeli side of the border on Jan. 8, 2024 in Southern Israel. (Amir Levy/Getty Images) President Joe Biden sanctioned four Israeli settlers in the West Bank on Thursday, part of an administration effort to curb civilian casualties in the region as Israel’s war with Hamas continues. Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/01/executive-order-on-imposing-certain-sanctions-on-persons-undermining-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) authorizing financial sanctions that can be applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who engage in acts of violence on the West Bank, a Palestinian territory on the Jordan River occupied by Israel. But the first four individuals designated under the order were Israeli settlers accused of violence against Palestinians and Biden made clear “extremist settler violence” motivated the move. “I have issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to deal with the threat posed by the situation in the West Bank, including in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction,” he wrote in a message to Congress accompanying the order. “Such actions constitute a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region and undermine the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States,” Biden continued. The United States supports a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, which settler activity in the West Bank threatens, he said. Violence in the area also threatens Israeli security and U.S. personnel and interests and could lead to “broader regional destabilization,” he wrote. [ ](/subscribe) GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX Freeze on U.S.-based assets The order is similar to other sanctions that aim to block access to the U.S. financial system, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. Two senior administration officials briefed reporters on details of the order Thursday on the condition they not be named. The order freezes any U.S.-based assets of designated individuals and blocks anyone in the U.S. from sending money or other services to the listed individuals. An initial State Department [ list](https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-further-measures-to-promote-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) Thursday named four Israeli settlers who were subject to the sanctions. The State Department accused the individuals of inciting and leading a riot, which caused the death of a Palestinian civilian, assaulting Palestinian farmers and Israeli peace activists, and “creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank.” White House Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a Biden campaign event in Michigan that the order was part of a longstanding commitment to peace in the region. “It’s a signal to the whole world how seriously President Biden takes this settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Kirby said, according to audio provided by the White House press pool. “He’s been very, very clear on that for a long, long time. It’s got to stop. It’s unacceptable. It’s a detriment to peace and security, certainly there in the West Bank and to the Palestinian people in general.” Israeli government officials were given advance notice of the order, Kirby said. Government officials are not intended targets of sanctions, Kirby said. Pressure from progressives The order comes amid pressure from progressive activists for the Biden administration to work to end the war that erupted after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. While Biden administration officials have affirmed Israel’s right to respond to the attack, they have increasingly demanded more attention to minimizing civilian casualties. “Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a [Thursday news release](https://www.state.gov/further-measures-to-promote-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) on the sanctions. “The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security, and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.” While the initial targets of the order were Israeli, a senior administration on the press call said the order is “non-discriminatory” and could be applied to “Israelis and Palestinians alike.” [ ](/donate) SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Официальное национальное информационное агентство сообщило, что целью удара был внутренний двор жилого дома в городе, добавив, что ракета попала в автомобиль домовладельца. Об этом сообщает LBCI.\nИзраиль регулярно бомбит своего северного соседа после ноябрьского соглашения о прекращении огня, которое было направлено на прекращение более чем годичных боевых действий с \"Хезболлой\", включая два месяца полномасштабной войны.\nСоглашение требовало, чтобы \"Хезболла\" отошла к северу от реки Литани, примерно в 30 километрах (20 милях) от израильской границы, и демонтировала всю военную инфраструктуру к югу от нее.\nТакже от Израиля потребовалось вывести свои войска из Ливана, но Израиль сохранил их на пяти позициях, которые он считает “стратегическими”.\n# Ливан # Израиль # Хезболла",

    "text": "Defending champions Canada have beaten the Football Ferns 2-1 in what'll go down as an infamous few days in Olympics history.\nThe clash came just days after New Zealand's opposition was caught spying on them, a drone heard hovering as they went through their set pieces in one of two reported incidents.\nSpeaking to 1News in the mixed zone after the match, captain Katie Bowen expressed her disappointment at the situation, which captured headlines around the world.\n\"It's just such a shock, and my heart goes out to the Canadian team as well cause we know those girls weren't involved and that's just straight up cheating and embarrassing,\" said Bowen.\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee has taken immediate action by dismissing an assistant and an analyst, the latter also handed a suspended jail sentence by French authorities.\nHead coach Bev Preistman stepped aside for the match - and since it finished she has been kicked out of the Games by the Canadian Olympic Committee following her suspension by Canada Soccer.\nMeanwhile New Zealand Football is seeking \"urgent action\" from FIFA.\n\"It's in the hands of the IOC, but it's an interesting precedent to set if they're to get away with this,\" said Bowen.\nNew Zealand's stand-in head coach Michael Mayne says the last 48 hours have been \"challenging\".\n\"It's been tough on the group.. it's hard to not look at it and what may have been.\n\"But I think the team's come out and given a good account of themselves against a good team,\" he said.\nWhether Canada deserves the three points, Mayne said he takes nothing away from Canada's performance.\nNew Zealand opened the scoring through Mackenzie Barry in the 13th minute, before Cloé Lacasse hit back in first-half injury time.\nEvelyne Viens scored the winner in the 79th minute.\n\"I take nothing away from the game, the game's the game and we lost the game.\n\"The powers at be will look at what's happened and we'll let them do that. My job is to allow us to bounce back against Colombia which is an important game for us,\" he said.",
