    "title": "Stubble as energy, fertiliser: 24 CBG units operational, 93 more underway in UP - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "Stubble, a significant contributor to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) during October and November due to widespread burning, has been transformed into an energy resource and natural fertiliser in Uttar Pradesh. This initiative not only tackles environmental issues but also enhances farmers’ incomes, according to a press statement from the state government issued on Thursday. Through the use of Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants, stubble is converted into energy and high-quality compost, turning waste into wealth. By supplying stubble to these plants, farmers are transitioning from being mere food producers to becoming energy providers. Currently, 24 CBG units are operational in UP, with 93 more under construction. The state aims to have over 100 CBG plants in operation. These plants purchase stubble from farmers as raw material, converting it into fuel.The growing mechanisation of farming, combined with a shortage of labour and rising labour costs, has resulted in the widespread use of combined harvesters for crop harvesting. After the main Kharif and Rabi crops, such as paddy and wheat, are harvested, farmers often resort to burning crop residue to prepare for the next planting season. This practice, especially after the paddy harvest, leads to severe air pollution in some regions during October and November. To combat this, the UP State Bio-Energy Policy 2022 offers various incentives for bio-CNG and CBG units that utilise agricultural waste. The government aims to establish CBG plants in every district. These CBG plants play a vital role in environmental protection, increasing farmers’ incomes, and promoting energy self-sufficiency. Each plant processes 200 metric tonnes of straw, 20 metric tonnes of press mud, and 10 metric tonnes of cattle dung daily, producing 20 metric tonnes of biogas and 125 metric tonnes of organic manure, which helps enhance agricultural productivity. Investors have shown strong interest, with 21 out of 26 proposed projects receiving in-principle approval. The government plans to bring 20 of these projects into operation by 2025, with a goal to double bio-coal and biodiesel production during this period.",

    "text": "He has Husband Material Signs . Now you want to write a love letter to your boyfriend, but don’t know where or how to start? You’ll find some extremely useful tips on writing a love letter to your boyfriend. This can also be one of the Ways to Make Your Boyfriend Fall in Love with You Again .\nContents\nTop Tips On Writing A Love Letter To Your Boyfriend 1. Don’t Worry About Making It Sound Like A ‘Love Letter’ You don’t have to stress about making it sound like what you think a love letter should. It’s all about the sincerity that you’re writing it with. If it comes from your heart and the words are truly yours, you can be sure he’ll be able to sense the love it’s written with.\n2. The Delivery Is Irrelevant Okay, it might just be relevant, but keep in mind that the delivery is not everything. You can literally post it, or you can simply slip it into his hand before you part for the day. Really, it doesn’t matter.\n3. Make It A Surprise Don’t tell him that you’re writing him a love letter. Make it a surprise. Whether as a birthday or anniversary gift or even just to show him your love. Boys love surprises, you know.\n4. Write About The Past, Present & Future This is a crucial tip for writing a love letter to your boyfriend. If you’re not sure how to structure your letter, write about the past, followed by the present and then the future. You can talk about the moment you first met him, what you’re feeling right now, and your hopes for the future of your relationship.\n5. Vary The Content However, don’t spend the entire length of the letter talking about just one thing. Even though it’s a love letter, he can get bored. Write about different things and recall different moments from different points of your relationship. Make it a roller coaster ride –make him smile, laugh, cry, and reminisce.\n6. Tell Him What You Like About Him An important thing to keep in mind is to write what will make him feel happy. It might be comforting for him to know what you like about him. If anything, it’s possible that he’ll try to better himself in those aspects if he knows you’ll love him even more.\n7. Accept That The First Draft Will Be Bad The first time you’re drafting the letter, just write your heart out. It’s only for your eyes anyway, and you’ll have to edit and proofread the letter at least twice. No love letter will come out perfect the first time around, so don’t feel discouraged. You can write a touching letter.\n8. Say What’s In Your Heart Don’t use content you can find on the Internet. Write only what you want to say. Be as honest and candid as you can. Your boyfriend will know if you merely rewrote professionally-composed love confessions in your squiggly handwriting. This is the sweetest tips on writing a love letter to your boyfriend\n9. Use Simple, Everyday Language Really, you don’t have to use flowery language or archaic words just to make it read like a love letter. Even though its popularity has fallen in the modern days, it doesn’t mean you can’t use modern language. If anything, it’ll make the content comprehensible and feel more like a heart-to-heart conversation than a formal epistle.\n10. Make It Personal And Specific Details are important. Your boyfriend will appreciate inside jokes and specifics about your relationship that are personal and only known to you. He’ll feel that the letter is specially tailored for him, and feel more moved than if you include only generic topics.\n11. Don’t Worry About The Length The length doesn’t matter. You don’t need to write a three-paged composition to call it a love letter. In fact, if you’re not comfortable writing lengthy letters, don’t. A few paragraphs are fine, as long as they reflect your emotions and genuineness.\n12. Don’t Worry About The Looks Again, you also don’t have to worry about how the aesthetic of your letter. Sure, it helps if you have extra neat and beautiful handwriting, but if it’s legible, then you’re okay.\n13. The Message Matters, Not The Format So the length and the looks don’t matter. So doesn’t the format. Whether the letter consists of just words or a mix of doodles and colors, it’s the message you want to get across that is important.\n14. Write A Letter He’d Want To Receive Don’t write about how lucky you think he is for having a girlfriend like you, although you can say some Reasons Why You Should Love Me . Remember, the letter is intended to make him feel better about himself, about your relationship. So write something you think he’d want to hear. Tell him he’s amazing, that you’re lucky to have him.\n15. Don’t Be Afraid To Open Up This one speaks for itself. Don’t be scared to wear your hair on your sleeves when you’re writing a love letter. Be honest and tell him what you are thinking about.\n16. Tell Him You Love Him After all, what’s a love letter without the theatrical phrase of ‘I love you’? It doesn’t have to drip with these words but mention once or twice that you feel this way. Maybe he knows it already because you did the Things to Do to Prove You Love Your Boyfriend , but what’s the harm in reminding him? What’s the harm of making him smile?\n17. Conclude With A Summation Of Your Love Finally, end the letter with something which represents your love. An inside joke, your hopes for the future, gratitude, and even another ‘I love you’!\nReasons To Write A Love Letter To Your Boyfriend Maybe you’re still not sure if you should write him a love letter. Well, it really is a great idea to do so. Why?\n1. It’s Romantic There’s really nothing more romantic than a handwritten love letter, complete with a signature and heart doodles all over.\n2. It’s Not Just A Thing Of The Past Sure, love letters may have lost their appeal these days. But who says they’re just a thing of the past? In fact, most successful romantic relationships these days have had their own share of exchanging love letters.\n3. It Means You Actually Put Effort It means you actually took the time to compose and handwrite your love, not just type in sweet-nothings that take less than a minute on your phone. Or forward a cute gif via text message.\n4. It Stirs Him And Might Make Him Cry Your words might just make him emotional, even tear up. A heartfelt love letter will definitely deepen his feelings for you and make him respect you more.\n5. He Will Appreciate It Most importantly, he will appreciate the effort you put into making your feelings known to him. He might even think about returning the letter someday, and doesn’t the thought itself excite you?\nSo, now you have read these tips on writing a love letter to your boyfriend, what are you waiting for? Go write that long-due letter and watch his reaction as his heart skips a beat. This will also make the two of you grow closer to each other.",

    "title": "Harnessing Opportunities: India's Global Workforce Contribution | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "India stands at a pivotal juncture where its burgeoning workforce has become a sought-after asset on the global stage. With a strategic move by the government to enter agreements catering to the labour demands of countries facing demographic declines, a new avenue has opened for Indian workers seeking opportunities abroad. This not only addresses the growing employment needs of other nations but also potentially alleviates some of India's unemployment concerns. Countries grappling with labour shortages, including developed nations like Japan, France, and Israel, have expressed interest in engaging a significant number of Indian workers across diverse sectors. Taiwan's proposal to employ 100,000 Indians in various industries is a testament to the skills and capabilities India's workforce possesses. India's proactive approach in signing labour supply agreements indicates a willingness to engage in bilateral partnerships that encompass services and labour mobility. However, ensuring these agreements prioritize fair treatment, devoid of exploitation, becomes paramount. Legal safeguards must be established to safeguard the rights and welfare of the workers, preventing any form of mistreatment or abuse. The potential benefits extend beyond mere employment opportunities. Indian workers abroad often become crucial contributors to their families and the Indian economy through remittances. This symbiotic relationship between India and its expatriates contributes significantly to the country's economic growth. Nevertheless, to navigate this opportunity effectively, a meticulous approach is required. This includes meticulous planning to gauge future demands in other countries and aligning Indian workers' training and skill development accordingly. Moreover, establishing a transparent and equitable recruitment system is imperative to eliminate corruption and favoritism prevalent in such processes. Addressing concerns of workers facing issues abroad is equally crucial. A streamlined system for prompt grievance redressal can mitigate problems faced by Indian workers in foreign countries. This approach not only safeguards the workers' rights but also reinforces India's reputation for producing skilled and responsible global citizens. Yet, while celebrating the success stories of Indian workers globally, recent instances of unfavorable responses from expatriates in certain countries remind us of the delicate balance at play. The conduct of Indians abroad must remain exemplary, avoiding contentious actions that might sour diplomatic relations or provoke unwarranted backlash. To sum up, the current scenario presents a valuable opportunity for India and its workforce. By leveraging this situation thoughtfully, India can not only address its unemployment concerns but also establish a stronger foothold as a global provider of skilled labor. However, this must be undertaken with careful planning, robust regulatory frameworks, and a commitment to upholding ethical standards to ensure mutual benefit and sustained positive relationships on the global stage.
