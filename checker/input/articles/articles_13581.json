    "text": "San José, 28 dic (EFE).- El sacerdote nicaragüense Carlos Áviles, vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, capital de Nicaragua, fue detenido este jueves por la Policía en medio de tensiones entre el Gobierno del presidente Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica, denunció la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina.\n\"El Ministerio del Interior amanece realizando su primera arbitrariedad. Han secuestrado a monseñor Carlos Avilés, vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, quien en años anteriores declaró que el presidente Daniel Ortega miente al decir que en Nicaragua hay libertad\", denunció Molina, autora del estudio titulado 'Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?', a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).\nLa opositora Unidad Nacional Azul y Blanco también denunció la detención del sacerdote de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, que dirige el cardenal nicaragüense, Leopoldo Brenes, quien aún no se refiere a esa denuncia.\n\"Otro zarpazo represivo de la dictadura contra la Iglesia católica. Su secuestro se suma al encarcelamiento del obispo Isidoro Mora, dos sacerdotes y dos seminaristas en los últimos días\", indicó la Unidad Nacional en una declaración.\nEn el caso de Mora, obispo de la diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, quien fue encarcelado junto a dos seminaristas, fue detenido el 20 de diciembre un día después de invocar en una homilía al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nNi el Gobierno que preside Daniel Ortega ni la Policía Nacional ha confirmado o negado la presunta detención de otro sacerdote.\nEn el caso de Mora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en cadena nacional lo calificó de \"soberbio\", \"desquiciado\" y \"energúmeno\".\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas, y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.EFE\nmg/rao/laa",

    "title": "Milwaukee-based retail giant Kohl's says 'No' to sponsoring Republican convention events",
    "text": "A Kohl&amp;#x27;s department store sign hangs outside the building on March 12, 2024 in Miami, Florida. Shares of Kohl&amp;#x27;s fell as it posted a drop in same-store sales in the fourth quarter. Joe Raedle | Getty Images Milwaukee based department store giant Kohl&amp;#x27;s says it will not sponsor any events related to the Republican National Convention in that city this summer, where Donald Trump will be crowned the party&amp;#x27;s nominee for president. &quot;Kohl&amp;#x27;s is not a political organization nor donor and is not sponsoring nor engaging in any specific RNC events,&quot; a spokeswoman for the company told CNBC. &quot;We support the business community through the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.&quot; The convention is expected to bring around 50,000 people to the Brew City from July 15 - 18, culminating in Trump&amp;#x27;s all but certain acceptance of his party&amp;#x27;s nomination on the final night. The announcement comes as both Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to secure corporate support for their party conventions at a time when many big name brands are trying to stay far away from politics. Among Wisconsin&amp;#x27;s largest companies on the Fortune 500, the top two are planning to directly sponsor the convention: Northwestern Mutual and Fiserv. The next two, ManpowerGroup and Kohl&amp;#x27;s, are not. ManpowerGroup told CNBC it is supporting the nonprofit Milwaukee 2024 Host Committee through donations to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce (MMAC). &quot;We have not directly provided funds to the RNC but rather MMAC has provided funds on our and others behalf, just like they did for the DNC [Democratic National Convention],&quot; a spokeswoman said. Northwestern Mutual, on the other hand, is on the host committee, and its CEO John Schlifske is reportedly helping to raise money for the group. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in his first presidential campaign in 2016. But he lost the state to President Joe Biden in 2020. The state is viewed by both Republicans and Democrats as a must-win this November. Kohl&amp;#x27;s has not funded either the Republican or Democratic conventions for over a decade, according to Federal Election Commission filings. In 2002, the company donated $10,000 to the Republican National Committee&amp;#x27;s state elections committee, with funds mostly dedicated to GOP state parties, according to FEC records. The state&amp;#x27;s late Democratic senator, Herb Kohl, was president of his family-founded company until the late 1970s. The absence of Kohl&amp;#x27;s from the list of Republican convention sponsors notable, given that convention organizers have publicly touted the importance of Wisconsin-based companies helping to fund and organize the event. Former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is chair of the city&amp;#x27;s host committee, told The Wall Street Journal that virtually all of Wisconsin&amp;#x27;s Fortune 500 companies have pledged financial support. The Republican convention is aiming to raise roughly $70 million. Representatives for the Republican National Committee and the Milwaukee host committee did not return requests for comment. Kohl&amp;#x27;s&amp;#x27; decision to hold off on donating to the convention coincides with the company&amp;#x27;s renewed effort to find its footing in a competitive market. Kohl&amp;#x27;s is chasing a turnaround and trying to capitalize on its locations in suburban strip malls, especially as rival Macy&amp;#x27;s closes about 150 of its namesake stores. Yet, the company&amp;#x27;s sales have been shrinking and it has relied on an aging customer base as it competes with an expanding field of retail competitors, including Target, Shein and Amazon. Kohl&amp;#x27;s stock tumbled more than 20% earlier this month, after it missed Wall Street&amp;#x27;s expectations for earnings and revenue. It&amp;#x27;s been trying to woo younger shoppers by opening more Sephora shops inside of Kohl&amp;#x27;s, adding Babies R Us shops and expanding its mix of trendier merchandise, such as more fashion-forward apparel and a larger department of home décor.

    "text": "Public financing programs for elections can mitigate the obstacles facing new or less-wealthy candidates, but it fails to address – and may even exacerbate – the problems of “vote-splitting” and “spoiler” candidates. If more candidates enter a race, the larger pools can lead to split fields and winners without broad support. Of course, some candidates may still choose to stay out of a race despite the new funding – out of fear that they’ll split the vote with ideologically or demographically similar candidates.\nRanked choice voting (RCV) helps voters navigate crowded fields and elect a majority winner, making it the perfect complement to public financing or democracy voucher programs. Seattle, Oakland, and New York City are already leading the way in this pairing.\nMany U.S. cities and states use some form of public financing for campaigns (also sometimes known as “public funding”). Typically, these programs offer matching funds to campaigns that meet certain criteria. One unique example of public financing is Seattle’s Democracy Vouchers program ; the city provides eligible residents with $50 in vouchers to contribute to candidates of their choice.\nPublic financing can lead to large fields of candidates that can be difficult for voters to manage in choose-one elections. For example, the average number of city council candidates in Seattle rose from 3.9 (in the four election years prior to adopting Democracy Vouchers) to 8.6 (in the four election years since adoption).\nSimilarly, New York City expanded its public matching program in 2021, at the same time it implemented RCV. The 2021 election saw the highest number of candidates in the city’s history, with first-time candidates getting the biggest boost from public financing.\nWith that larger candidate field, RCV ensured the candidates with the broadest support won, and that candidates who appealed to the same voter base didn’t split the vote. The election resulted in the city’s first majority-female city council, which was also majority-people of color and had the youngest member in the council’s history at just 23 years old.\nAcross the nation, Seattle voted to adopt RCV in 2022 and will implement it by 2027 – pairing RCV and its Democracy Vouchers program. Meanwhile, Oakland, CA has enacted reform in the opposite order – it has long used RCV and voted to adopt its own “ Democracy Dollars ” program on the 2022 ballot.\nOnce RCV is paired with public financing in both Seattle and Oakland, we’ll see two more examples of how these reforms can complement one another.\nThis is the eighth post in FairVote’s ongoing #PutRCVOnIt series, where we examine how RCV works in conjunction with, and improves, other election reforms. We acknowledge that there are many ideas for improving American democracy, but also that no reform is a silver bullet. We explain why RCV is a key piece of the puzzle, and how it fits in with other pieces.",

    "title": "Ending nuclear weapons, before they end us",
    "text": "This May, the World Health Assembly (WHA) will vote on re-establishing a mandate for the World Health Organization (WHO) to address the health consequences of nuclear weapons and war [1]. Health professionals and their associations should urge their governments to support such a mandate and support the new UN comprehensive study on the effects of nuclear war.\nThe first atomic bomb exploded in the New Mexico desert 80 years ago, in July 1945. Three weeks later, two relatively small (by today’s standards), tactical-size nuclear weapons unleashed a cataclysm of radioactive incineration on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By the end of 1945, about 213,000 people were dead [2]. Tens of thousands more have died from late effects of the bombings.\nLast December, Nihon Hidankyo, a movement that brings together atomic bomb survivors, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its 'efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again' [3]. For the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the award validated the most fundamental human right: the right to live. The Committee warned that the menace of nuclear weapons is now more urgent than ever before. In the words of Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes, 'it is naive to believe our civilisation can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons. The world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation' [4]. He noted that our survival depended on keeping intact the 'nuclear taboo' (which stigmatises the use of nuclear weapons as morally unacceptable) [5].\nThe nuclear taboo gains strength from recognition of compelling evidence of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear war, its severe global climatic and famine consequences, and the impossibility of any effective humanitarian response. This evidence contributed significantly to ending the Cold War nuclear arms race [6, 7].\nWhile the number of nuclear weapons is down to 12,331 now, from their 1986 peak of 70,300 [8], this is still equivalent to 146,605 Hiroshima bombs [9], and does not mean humanity is any safer [10]. Even a fraction of the current arsenal could decimate the biosphere in a severe mass extinction event. The global climate disruption caused by the smoke pouring from cities ignited by just 2% of the current arsenal could result in over two billion people starving [11].\nA worldwide nuclear arms race is underway. Deployed nuclear weapons are increasing again, and China, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia and UK are all enlarging their arsenals. An estimated 2,100 nuclear warheads in France, Russia, UK, US and, for the first time, also in China, are on high alert, ready for launch within minutes [8]. With disarmament in reverse, extensive nuclear modernisations underway, multiple arms control treaties abrogated without replacement, no disarmament negotiations in evidence, nuclear-armed Russia and Israel engaged in active wars involving repeated nuclear threats, Russia and the US deploying nuclear weapons to additional states, and widespread use of cyberwarfare, the risk of nuclear war is widely assessed to be greater than ever. This year the Doomsday Clock was moved the closest to midnight since the Clock’s founding in 1947 [10].\nLed by Ireland and New Zealand, in late 2024, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted overwhelmingly to establish a 21-member independent scientific panel to undertake a new comprehensive study on the effects of nuclear war [12], with its final report due in 2027. Noting that 'removing the threat of a nuclear war is the most acute and urgent task of the present day', the panel has been tasked with examining the physical effects and societal consequences of a nuclear war on a local, regional and planetary scale. It will examine the climatic, environmental and radiological effects of nuclear war, and their impact on public health, global socioeconomic systems, agriculture and ecosystems.\nThe resolution calls upon UN agencies, including WHO, to support the panel’s work, including by 'contributing expertise, commissioned studies, data and papers'. All UN Member States are encouraged to provide relevant information, scientific data and analyses; facilitate and host panel meetings, including regional meetings; and make budgetary or in-kind contributions. Such an authoritative international assessment of evidence on the most acute existential threat to humankind and planetary health is long overdue. The last such report dates from 1989. It is shameful that France, UK and Russia opposed this resolution [13].\nIn 1983 and 1987 [14], WHO convened an international committee of scientists and health experts to study the health effects of nuclear war. Its landmark, authoritative reports were influential and an excellent example of WHO fulfilling its constitutional mandate 'to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work'. In 1993, WHO produced an additional shorter report on the health and environmental effects of nuclear weapons, which included discussion of the production chain of nuclear weapons, including processing, testing and disposal [15].\nHowever, despite WHA having mandated WHO to report periodically on relevant developments, no further work was undertaken and in 2020 WHO’s mandate on nuclear weapons and health lapsed.\nThe Marshall Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu, supported by seven co-sponsoring states and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), are working to renew WHO’s mandate. They are seeking wide support for a resolution on the health effects of nuclear weapons/war at this year’s WHA in Geneva on 19-27 May [1]. WHO would then re-establish a programme of work on this most critical threat to health, and be able to lead strongly in providing the best health evidence to the UN panel.\nHealth professionals are well aware how crucial accurate and up-to-date evidence is to making good decisions. We and our organisations should support such a renewed mandate by urging our national WHA delegates to vote in support and commit the modest funds needed to re-establish WHO’s work programme, especially now, as the organisation faces severe financial strain with the US decision to withdraw its membership.\nOur joint editorial in 2023 [[16](/articles/s41391-025-00988-3#ref-CR16)] on reducing the risks of nuclear war and the role of health professionals, published in over 150 health journals worldwide, urged three immediate steps by nuclear-armed states and their allies: adopt a 'no first use' policy, take their nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert, and pledge unequivocally that they will not use nuclear weapons in any current conflicts they are involved in. We also urged nuclear-armed states to work for a definitive end to the nuclear threat by urgently starting negotiations for a verifiable, timebound agreement to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, and called on all nations to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons [[17](/articles/s41391-025-00988-3#ref-CR17)].\nIt is an alarming failure of leadership that no progress has been made on these needed measures, nor on many other feasible steps away from the brink, acting on the obligation of all states to achieve nuclear disarmament. Nine states jeopardise all humanity and the biosphere by claiming an exclusive right to wield the most destructive and inhumane weapons ever created. The world desperately needs the leaders of these states to freeze their arsenals, end the modernisation and development of new, more dangerous nuclear weapons, and ensure that new technology such as artificial intelligence can never trigger the launch of nuclear weapons.\nThe UN scientific panel and a renewed mandate for WHO’s work in this area can provide vital authoritative and up-to-date evidence for health and public education, evidence-based advocacy and policies, and the mobilised public concern needed to trigger decisive political leadership. This is a core health imperative for all of us.\nReferences\nWorld Health Organization. Effects of nuclear weapons and war on health and health services.

    "title": "‘Miracle of Miracles’: #6076 Meets #356066 and a Family Is (Re)discovered",
    "text": "August 2024—first meeting—Alec, Sharon and Bronya, standing, Yury and Roman seated. Researcher 356066 contacted me through my registry at JewishGen, a website billed as “The Global Home for Jewish Genealogy.” Unbeknownst to me, that researcher named Yury was the great-grandson of my Granduncle Shmuel Murovanny.\nIn the infancy of JewishGen, I posted my ancestral family names and locations on the website. Only 349,990 researchers came between Yury and me.\nOn May 17, 2022, I posted a blog, “Here We Go Again,” at sharonmarkcohen.com. While reading it in preparation to send the written proof of our relationship to my newly surfaced cousin Yury, I choked up reading one particular paragraph, thinking that it must have been a premonition.\nBronislava (Bronya) with her mother, Rachil (Raya), and her brother Gregory Dorfman. “Ten letters from Shmulik [Shmuel] and one from his son Leib, all penned 100 years ago, will certainly be something to discuss when we find their offspring. They’ll have a descriptive narrative of their ancestors … our ancestors, and their impoverished existence before WWII.”\nWhile skeptical that this day would materialize, my motto, “patient perseverance,” paid off. The answer to my prayers for finding one of the two lost branches of our family began with that unexpected email I received from Yury in 2023.\nThe day Yury’s first note arrived we were in Ohio celebrating our granddaughter’s fourth birthday. Fortunately, my emails came along on my iPhone.\nScrap of paper from files of Bronya’s mother, Raya, about Bludoy cousins in Chudnov. After the party, and tucking our granddaughter into bed, I sat reviewing my emails when suddenly I gulped. Never before in all the years listed on JewishGen have any questioners been able to make a firm connection. This time was different.\nYury posted all the matching details I had been seeking for decades. For over 35 years, I researched, found and met members of all but two branches of my grandfather’s large family.\nAn old cookie tin, stashed at the bottom of my aunt’s food pantry, held our family history. Included were letters from my Granduncle Shmuel, Yury’s great-grandfather, who remained in Ukraine for his entire life.\nThe background of the original family name “Murovanny,” which Shmuel used when signing that treasure chest of letters, was only explained by my cousin Alexey within the past year. Alexey, born and bred in Charkov, Ukraine, and now residing in Germany, had a close relationship with his paternal grandmother—a first cousin to my father.\nPhoto includes at least one of Shmuel’s sons beneath the arrow. Bronya thinks it was either her mother’s brother Gershon or Lyolya, both MIA. In 1935, Alexey’s grandmother, whose parents, as my grandparents, were first cousins before marriage, changed the family name to be less Jewish-sounding. They took the name of Muravin for the men and Muravina for the women.\nMy grandfather Nathan and his brother Louis emigrated from Chudnov, Ukraine, within the first 14 years of the 20th century. Nathan settled in Newark, New Jersey, and Louis in Philadelphia. Later, joined by their wives and children, they all Americanized the family name to Mark.\nMinimalists beware: Correspondence from relatives in the old country, dated before 1935, which my aunt so intuitively saved, confirmed the original family name as Murovanny. Knowing that name, a far cry from “Mark,” was how I made the connection to Yury when he first wrote that coveted email to me at 11:55 PM:\n“From researcher code 356066\n“To researcher code 6076\nBronya’s uncle Leib (Lev), the last Levi of Shmuel’s descendants, died in 1971 in Ukraine. Lev’s two younger brothers went missing in action in WWII. Unbeknownst to Bronya, her Uncle Lev had a first wife and three children spoken about in the family letters; he remarried in 1945 and had one daughter. “My grandmother was from Polonnoye, Ukraine. Her maiden name was Murovanny. Her parents were Samuil and Bracha. She lived in Starokonstantinov, Ukraine after the war. My mother remembers going to Chudnov to visit my grandmother’s uncle. Please share any information you have.”\nImagine my shock and thrill when reading those words.\nOur email conversation continued in rapid-fire. In the past, mutual relatives with knowledge of others from our clan gave me clues for my research. Often, finding one long-lost cousin led to finding another. Unlike other cousins I’ve met since 1994, who emigrated from Ukraine, this time, none of us had any idea the other existed. Shmuel’s family is the only branch I never expected to meet when, miraculously, our contact came through social media.\nThe letters saved by my aunt held the key. After hand-delivering them to my cousin Harry Langsam, z”l, in Los Angeles to translate, we learned that Bronya’s mother existed. Unfortunately, there was no living relative to make the introduction to any of her possible descendants. Instead, with no idea there were relatives in America, Yury found me.\nThe true beauty is that the correspondence my aunt saved survived. Amazingly, letters from every branch of my grandparents’ large family exist. Because of those heart-wrenching letters, we can tell the direct descendants more about how their ancestors … our ancestors, lived.\nBronya steps into the home of her second cousin, as her eldest son, Alec, is greeted by Cousin Sharon. The greatest gifts I could ever give newly found cousins include letters from ancestors and awareness of our family history. A gruesome occurrence that happened before Bronya was born is that Shmuel’s eldest son Leib (aka Lev) survived the war, but his wife and three children, Shmuel’s grandchildren, perished. Bronya knew her aunt and female cousin living in Israel, but not that they were his “new” family. What I learned is that Shmuel’s next two sons went missing in action in WWII.\nYury learned about our family in an 18-part blog post series on my website. After reading that, he wrote, “I’m reading your blogs over and over to get a better understanding of our family. It’s a lot to take in!”\nAlong with the email, Yury attached two handwritten notes his grandmother wrote in Russian that he thought may interest me. Those notes, with names and addresses of Bludoy relatives, were our matching link. About 25 years ago, after contacting the Bludoys, we drove to their home in North Carolina, where they invited us to stay a few days.\nOne of the younger Bludoy cousins was in medical school in New York. While we never met, we spoke on the telephone. Decades later, Yury, also in the medical field, met Dr. Bludoy at work and wondered if he could be a cousin.\nAlmost magically, Yury first contacted me on our granddaughter’s 4th birthday, and it was on our grandson’s 4th birthday, 15 months later, back in Ohio celebrating, when Yury contacted me to firm up a date to meet in early August.\nAllowing us to get the most out of our meeting, Yury, his mother and brothers arrived without their spouses or children. As much as I wanted to meet the entire crew, it was a wise decision. They could immerse themselves in the memorabilia I was eager to share.\nAs I watched my cousins leafing through the notebook of letters from their direct ancestors, plus those from our extended family from Chudnov and the surrounding area in Ukraine, I was filled with emotion. I then pointed to the wall in our dining room where pictures of the ship my father arrived on with my grandmother and uncle, along with various documents and family photographs, are hanging. It’s an added thrill when relatives from abroad read the documents in their native language.\nUpon sharing the news of that special day with members of the Chudnov Children Facebook Group, one of the first people to “like” the note was our cousin, who still lives in Chudnov today. Emailing cousins around the world brought meaningful replies.\nAfter sending the pictures of our meeting to our cousin in Sochi, Russia, she wrote, “I was very excited to look at the photos of your meeting with Shmuel’s family. I will tell you honestly, I was upset that I was not with you at that moment.” She added, “How I want to find the Roytmans!” That discovery will connect our final link of the family of seven children from my great-grandparents who married in Chudnov, Ukraine, on October 30, 1863.\nAbout our meeting, Yury wrote, “It was really amazing seeing you and Arnie today. My mother was so happy as well. It meant a lot to her. I think she’s still in disbelief seeing her mother’s and grandmother’s letters.\n“I realized we have something very important in common that is directly responsible for us finding each other. When you were explaining to Roman how you got so interested in your ancestry, you said it was because you felt something missing since you did not get to meet any of your grandparents. I have had the same empty feeling since I was a child because I did not get to see any of my grandparents either. That void left by our grandparents resulted in a lifelong interest and research. Thank you for being so welcoming and thank you for filling part of that void today.”\nI could not help but reply, “Yury, I’m filled with emotion. I know we only met today but I love you all so much. The letters, our family history, being together … it’s a miracle. May we share many happy times. There must be dancing going on in heaven. Maybe that’s what the thunderstorm is about!;-).”\nThat’s the way long-lost cousins weaved their way into my life. To think—I hold the Murovanny family history. It’s truly a miracle, but we were destined to be together. It only took a century.",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis shakes hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at the Vatican, May 13, 2023. Vatican Media/­Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\nKYIV (Reuters) – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he discussed Ukraine’s peace formula in a call with Pope Francis on Thursday.\n“We discussed our joint work to put Ukraine’s Peace Formula into action,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n“Over 80 countries are already involved in this process at the level of their representatives. And there will be more of them,” he added.\nZelenskiy said he thanked Francis for his Christmas greetings “as well as his wishes for a just peace for all of us.”\nZelenskiy has said that Ukraine’s peace formula will next be discussed in Davos, Switzerland, but has not given a date.\nAs part of his peace efforts on Ukraine, the pope has sent a special envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow, Washington and Beijing.\nIn his Christmas Day message, the pope called for an end to multiple conflicts, including the one in Ukraine. In November, in a renewal of his persistent calls for an end to violence in Ukraine and the Middle East, he said “peace is possible” and that “we must not resign ourselves.”\nZelenskiy said in October that he had invited Francis to Kyiv. The Ukrainian leader met privately with the pope at the Vatican in May.\n(Reporting, writing by Elaine Monaghan in Washington; Additional reporting by Oleksandr Kozhukhar in Kyiv; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

    "text": "Si la présence de sulfates sur Mars n&#039;est pas nouvelle, cette découverte ne ressemble en rien aux précédentes. | Manuel Will via Unsplash L&#039;astromobile Curiosity, qui parcourt la planète Mars pour en percer les secrets, vient de faire une découverte stupéfiante. En roulant accidentellement sur un rocher du canal de Gediz Vallis, ce dernier s&#039;est brisé, révélant de mystérieux cristaux jaunes: du soufre dans sa forme la plus pure. Un véritable trésor pour les scientifiques. Si la présence de sulfates sur Mars n&#039;est pas nouvelle, cette découverte ne ressemble en rien aux précédentes: c&#039;est en fait la première fois que du soufre est découvert sous sa forme élémentaire pure sur la planète rouge. Le soufre est un élément essentiel à toute vie. En général, il est absorbé sous forme de sulfates et utilisé pour fabriquer deux acides aminés dont les organismes vivants ont besoin pour fabriquer des protéines. Ces sulfates se forment notamment quand du soufre est mélangé à d&#039;autres minéraux dans l&#039;eau. Une fois que cette dernière s&#039;évapore, elle laisse derrière elle des traces de ces fameux sulfates. De vrai mines d&#039;or d&#039;informations, que les scientifiques analysent depuis longtemps pour comprendre l&#039;évolution de l&#039;eau sur Mars. Le soufre pur, en revanche, raconte une tout autre histoire. Sa formation nécessite un ensemble de conditions spécifiques et rares, que les scientifiques n&#039;imaginent pas se produire à l&#039;emplacement où cette roche a été accidentellement trouvée. De quoi venir chambouler tous leurs calculs. Analyse à venir Les chercheurs ne sont pas encore au bout de leurs surprises. Le canal de Gediz Vallis est en fait jonché de roches similaires. Nul doute que du soufre élémentaire se cache aussi dans de nombreuses d&#039;entre elles. «Trouver un champ de pierres faites de soufre pur, c&#039;est comme trouver une oasis dans le dÃƒÂ©sertÃ‚Â», explique au mÃƒÂ©dia ScienceAlert Ashwin Vasavada, membre du projet Curiosity du Jet Propulsion Laboratory de la NASA. Ã‚Â«Cela ne devrait pas ÃƒÂªtre lÃƒÂ .Ã‚Â» Le canal de Gediz Vallis est un ancien cours d&#039;eau dont les vestiges portent les traces du passage d&#039;un fleuve qui coulait autrefois, il y a des milliards d&#039;annÃƒÂ©es. Désormais, les scientifiques vont tenter de comprendre comment ce soufre pur s&#039;est retrouvé ici. Et ça tombe bien, Curiosity va leur donner un sacré coup de pouce: l&#039;astromobile a prélevé un échantillon de poudre issue du cœur d&#039;un de ces rochers, afin de l&#039;analyser.",
