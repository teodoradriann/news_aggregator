    "text": "Kelly Clarkson shocks Jimmy Fallon with 'filthy' Pictionary drawing: 'Badminton!' It's not very likely that [Kelly Clarkson](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/02/01/kelly-clarkson-prediabetic-weight-loss/72435260007/) will ever be asked to join the Pictionary Hall of Fame – especially not after what happened on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon. Clarkson made an appearance on the show Wednesday with Peyton Manning and Mike Tirico, who will join her as hosts for the [2024 Olympic Games ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/03/13/kelly-clarkson-and-peyton-manning-join-nbc-s-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-coverage-as-hosts/72953518007/)opening ceremony set to take place in Paris later this year. The trio was invited to participate in a friendly game of \"Olympictionary,\" an Olympics-themed version of Pictionary. Clarkson, who was asked to draw first, warned Fallon: “Oh, my gosh. I can’t draw.” Still she proceeds to pick a word and gets “ [shuttlecock](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shuttlecock),” which is a the conical object with a rounded, often rubber-covered nose that is used in the sport badminton. It's also often called a \"birdie.\" It turns out, Clarkson did not know what the projectile was called because her drawing went a totally different, NSFW direction. Watch the hilarious moment below. Fallon recognizes Clarkson’s skittish behavior, saying to her “You’re having a meltdown.\" She tells Fallon it's an object, saying she’s unsure “this (drawing) can be aired.” Clarkson, unsure how to draw the clue, opts to draw a [penis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/08/07/penis-men-afraid-talk-average-size/70468460007/) for part two of the word. Her drawing is immediately blurred out, with Clarkson flailing her arms in embarrassment. “I’m so sorry, Mom” Clarkson tells the camera as Fallon moves to take his coat off. “I mean, if you drew it smaller, I would know what it is,” Fallon jokes. Fallon continues to guess based on the drawing, throwing out rocket ship, stadium and Goodyear blimp train as Clarkson tries to draw a shuttle, part one of the word. The buzzer rings, letting Fallon know he’s out of guesses. “I don’t know what else to say. I can’t say. It’s filthy. I don’t know what it is,\" Fallon says. “What in the world could that be?” Fallon asks. Manning steps in to offer a guess, revealing the correct answer. But Fallon just couldn't get over the drawing gone wild. “You couldn’t draw a tennis racket? Badminton! Badminton. Badminton. You just draw the filthiest thing. You’re America’s sweetheart. We’re both America’s sweetheart. And we did the dirtiest thing we’ve ever done in the history of our career,” Fallon jokes.",

From Order from numerous shops above the reservation of vacation trips to online banking as well the use of digital payment systems – hardly anything runs over the Internet these days. Actually, people should therefore move more cautiously in this segment be concerned with maximum safety not true? Think!\nWhat are the most common passwords in 2024? Although the current year still has a few weeks to offer, it is slowly but surely coming to an end. It is therefore the time of analyzes and flashbacks . As usual, this also includes a more detailed examination of the most frequently used passwords . Unfortunately, as is so often the case, 2024 is looking quite a bit frightening picture Despite all the incidents and risks, users have by no means become more cautious or at least more creative.\nAdvertisement Bitdefender Total Security 2024\nLike from one current report from security provider NordPass also dominated over the course of this year equally unimaginative and insecure passwords . When analyzing global data, the classic “123456” is once again at the top of the most frequently used security codes. Directly behind it are the slightly longer variants “123456789” and “12345678”, which, however, are not a bit better or more secure.\nAccording to the experts, such simple passwords are cracked in less than a second and make it particularly easy for hackers . This has been known for some time, but users don't seem to be impressed by it. We have summarized the top 10 of 2024 in an overview for you.\n123456 123456789 12345678 password qwerty123 qwerty1 12345 secret 123123 Read too\nRooms from 4Players : Launch of the new video conferencing platform, free for private individuals The Hamburg gaming specialist 4Players is setting new standards with its video conferencing platform “Rooms”.\nBlade Runner and Terminator become reality : Elon Musk with an incredible declaration of war – also to gamers US billionaire Elon Musk talks about the incredible capabilities of Neuralink in a podcast.\nAfter a delay, now very quickly : AVM is releasing the new Fritzbox with Wifi 7 and incredibly fast internet Customers had to wait a little longer than expected for the new FritzBox from AVM. But now the start seems imminent.\nWhat does a secure password look like? Instead of resorting to such incredibly bad code, security experts have been advising for many years to use as much code as possible abstract combination of letters, numbers and special characters . Also that one Switching between upper and lower case within the password increases the security factor. Additionally, activation is one Two-step verification always makes sense.\nSource: North Pass",

    "text": "SPARTANBURG — The Flying Biscuit Cafe has announced plans to open a new location in downtown Spartanburg this fall.\nServing southern-inspired food,\nFlying Biscuit is scheduled to open its Spartanburg location at 121 W. Main St., in the building that formerly housed The Tulip Tree restaurant. The Tulip Tree closed in early 2024 after nearly four years in business.\nFounded in 1993, Flying Biscuit has 34 locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, South Carolina, Florida and Alabama. In 2019, it opened a location in\nGreenville's West End neighborhood. It also has locations in Columbia and Charlotte. The restaurant's popular menu items include pancake tacos, egg-stravaganza, hangover hash, and strawberry cheesecake stuffed French toast.\nIts breakfast and lunch menus are served all day.\nSpartanburg's downtown continues to draw interest with new restaurant openings.\nIsla's On The Square, an upscale seafood restaurant, opened July 2 at 113 N. Church St. Owner Brian Greene said more restaurant openings are likely in 2024 and 2025 as the city continues to grow and attract new visitors downtown.\nIn April,\nMain Street Pub at 252 W. Main St. reopened after completing renovations to expand the business. It's among businesses hoping to gain more customers when Spartanburg's new downtown baseball stadium Fifth Third Park opens in April 2025.\nSpartanburg Mayor Jerome Rice anticipates the area's economic growth to continue. He expects restaurants downtown to benefit with the opening of the new stadium as well.\n\"The new oyster bar is an added attraction to what we already have downtown,\" Rice said. \"It's an exciting time in Spartanburg to see all of the growth. Our restaurants are all different and reach everyone and bring people downtown.\"\nPeople coming downtown want to continue to have more dining options.\n\"The more options we have the better,\" Spartanburg City Councilwoman Erica Brown said, who attended Isla's On The Square's soft opening. \"People are looking for more options rather than just bar food. Isla's brings us a whole new feel of casual dining that is something unique and we don't have in any other parts of the city.\"\nBrown added, \"The Flying Biscuit is going to be great because there's not a lot of breakfast options downtown right now. It's going to be a great addition and increase foot traffic.\"",
