    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river.\nEmergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday.\nA 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said.\nChris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane.\nThe river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said.\nEmergency services have been dealing with a serious incident on Thursday (28 December) involving a 4×4 vehicle in the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors 🚨\nThree men sadly died at the scene.\nMore information is available here ⬇️ https://t.co/KgxPhHATO4 pic.twitter.com/AvDT3TiqCk\n— North Yorkshire Police (@NYorksPolice) December 28, 2023\nIt came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday.\nMr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said.\nHe and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said.\nPolice said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment.\nMr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards.\n“They were part of an off-road club.\n“I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nNUMBERPLATE PIXELLATED BY PA PICTURE DESK AT REQUEST OF NORTH YORKSHIRE POLICE The recovered vehicle being removed from the River Esk (Danny Lawson/PA) A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "text": "Business Insider I made one small change while traveling with my kids. It cost $150 but was worth every penny — and I wish I'd done it sooner. Emily Hochberg December 29, 2023 at 12:02 AM · 4 min read 1 Link Copied Read full article\nI travel regularly with my two kids, which requires a lot of stuff.\nUntil this month, I always brought our own car seats and Pack 'n Play crib.\nThis time, I rented car seats and a crib. I paid $150 extra but the change made travel much easier.\nMy husband and I started traveling with my first daughter when she was only 6 months old. We began with local road trips and later flew cross-country to Hawaii and Mexico .\nWe would always haul our car seat and Pack 'n Play alongside numerous suitcases and carry-on bags. It was a lot , but I preferred having our own stuff.\nBut when my second daughter was born in 2023, it quickly became clear that this strategy no longer served us. We were massively outnumbered by bags to people.\nSo when it was time to take another family trip this past December, I ditched our car seats and Pack 'n Play. It was a game changer for us as parents.\nEven though renting seats costs extra, I'll never bring these items again.\nMost of the author's luggage while traveling with just one child. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider Previously, I thought it would be easiest and safest to bring our own gear\nAs a nervous first-time parent, I initially shot down the idea of renting car seats.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says to replace a child's car seat anytime it is involved in a moderate to severe car crash. However, according to Safe Ride 4 Kids , there is no way to inspect a car seat after a crash to determine the severity of damage. The safest thing you can do is throw it away.\nThis made me anxious. What if someone rented a car with seats and got into a scuffle deemed minor, but damage occurred, I wondered.\nMy daughter in the car. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\nFor this reason, we always brought our own — plus, car seats are always free to check in with airlines so it seemed like a waste of money to rent them.\nWe purchased a second, lighter 10-pound travel seat for travel for my toddler instead of her 30-pound Britax Boulevard seat that had already cost us $350.\nI also thought it was more reliable to bring our own Pack 'n Play after encountering hotels with heavily-used models in rough shape, and one instance where they were all in use by other guests.\nBut then we had a second baby and took our first trip as a family of four. We flew from Palm Springs, California, to Denver, Colorado, when my baby was two months old.\nStill in an infant seat, we brought her Uppababy Mesa with its required base, a collective 20 pounds. We also had my toddler's travel car seat, a Pack 'n Play, three full-size suitcases, two diaper bags, two carry-on bags, and a travel stroller.\nI'm still not sure how we all made it from the curb to the check-in desk.\nI do, however, have vivid memories of schlepping it all off a car rental shuttle bus at the airport — thank you, sympathetic strangers who helped us — then across two lanes of traffic, into an elevator, and across the terminal while wrangling a toddler and infant. Tears were involved, and not just from my children.\nKnowing we had a family trip to Orlando six months later, we vowed to do things differently for our collective sanity.\nThe author started renting travel cribs on a trip to the Hotel Del Coronado instead of bringing her own. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider Packing lighter removed so much stress\nAs our Orlando trip neared, I couldn't stop thinking about all the stuff we had to bring.\nPerhaps more at ease as a second-time parent, I decided it was very unlikely a rental car agency would ever allow a crash to go undetected. I rebooked our rental to include one infant car seat and one toddler seat when we picked up the car for an extra $156.\nWe also left the Pack 'n Play behind. We'd previously been able to use Pack 'n Plays at hotels closer to home without an issue, on trips to Huntington Beach and Coronado, San Diego. And before we arrived in Orlando, I requested a Pack 'n Play at each of our two hotels ahead of time. Considering we were visiting the very family-friendly Walt Disney World area, I wasn't too worried about availability.\nWhen we landed in Orlando, our car rental agency had two seats waiting for us wrapped in plastic. While they felt cheaper and less sturdy than ours at home, they did the job.\nThere was no problem at each of our hotels with the Pack 'n Play either, and we brought our own sheet to make it more familiar for our baby.\nWhile we still had a lot to lug between suitcases, carry-ons, and a stroller, removing our heaviest, bulkiest baggage made a huge difference.\nIt was such a simple change, I can't believe we didn't do it sooner.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\nView comments",

    "title": "Críticas de Sumar y Podemos contra la nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres, a la que acusan de \"discursos transfóbicos\"",
    "text": "Ante la aprobación este miércoles del nombramiento de Isabel García como directora del Instituto de las Mujeres, [Sumar ](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/sumar-yolanda-diaz/)y [Podemos](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/podemos/) no han dudado en lanzar duras críticas. Desde la plataforma de [Yolanda Díaz](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/yolanda-diaz/) han considerado \"inaceptable\" el nombramiento de García y han opinado que dicha institución \"no puede estar en manos de quien menosprecia e insulta a las mujeres y a las personas LGTBI\". \"La libertad es de todas, todos y todes, o no es de nadie\", ha zanjado la coalición de izquierdas en una publicación en X, antes Twitter. \"Este nombramiento del Ministerio de Igualdad es vergonzoso y envía un mensaje lamentable. El Instituto de las Mujeres no puede estar dirigido por alguien que sostiene la conspiración del borrado de las mujeres y critica la dictadura queer\", ha añadido la portavoz de Sumar en materia de feminismo, igualdad y derechos y libertades LGTBI, Elizabeth Duval La exministra de Igualdad, [Irene Montero](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/irene-montero/), también ha querido lanzar un dardo al Ejecutivo de Pedro Sánchez ante el nuevo nombramiento. \"Hay algo más incómodo que el feminismo: la transfobia. Y pedir silencio cómplice\", ha escrito en X, antes Twitter. La dirigente de Podemos ha señalado poco antes en otra publicación que defender los derechos trans y LGTBI es \"una obligación democrática\". \"Más para un Gobierno que tiene la obligación de cumplir y hacer cumplir los Derechos Humanos. No olvidéis que somos más\", ha reiterado la exministra en una publicación en X. \"Qué viva la furia trans. Qué viva el orgullo LGTBI. Qué viva la lucha de las mujeres\", ha reivindicado. Los colectivos piden su destitución Estas críticas se suma también a la de la Federación Plataforma Trans y Euforia Familias Trans-Aliadas que ha denunciado que García \"ha mantenido discursos abiertamente transfóbicos y antiderechos trans\" durante la tramitación de la ley para este colectivo y ha pedido a la ministra de Igualdad, [Ana Redondo](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/ana-redondo/), que la revoque y ponga al frente a una mujer que defienda a todas las mujeres, también las trans. La organización ha indicado que \"los recortes de derechos trans llevados a cabo por [Isabel Díaz Ayuso](https://www.20minutos.es/minuteca/isabel-diaz-ayuso/), con la [derogación de aspectos fundamentales](https://www.20minutos.es/https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/5189726/0/madrid-aclara-que-los-planes-contra-acoso-formacion-sexual-se-mantendran-las-aulas-pesa-reforma-ley-trans-lgtbi/) de las leyes trans y LGTBI de la Comunidad de Madrid y los argumentos esgrimidos para ello, están en los mismos marcos ideológicos que defiende Isabel García\". La nueva directora del Instituto de las Mujeres fue, desde 2015, diputada de Igualdad, Juventud y Deportes de la Diputación de Valencia y concejala de Igualdad y Comercio del Ayuntamiento de Xirivella, cargos desde los que impulsó una de municipios contra la violencia de género en la Comunidad Valenciana y por la que fue premiada por el propio Ministerio de Igualdad en 2022, cuando era dirigido por Irene Montero.",

    "text": "طلاب الثانوية العامة بالفيوم: الفيزياء صعبة ومعقدة والتاريخ في مستوى الطالب العادى\nشهدت لجان امتحانات الثانوية العامة بمحافظة الفيوم، اليوم، أداء طلاب الشعبتين العلمية والأدبية امتحاني مادتي الفيزياء والتاريخ، وسط إجراءات تنظيمية مشددة من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم. وقد استمرت فترة الامتحان لمدة ثلاث ساعات، حيث انقسمت الآراء بين الطلاب حول صعوبة المواد.\nفيما يتعلق بامتحان الفيزياء، أعرب عدد كبير من طلاب الشعبة العلمية عن استيائهم من مستوى الأسئلة، مشيرين إلى أنها جاءت معقدة وتحتاج إلى تفكير عميق ووقت أطول لحلها.\nوأكد بعضهم أن الوقت المخصص للإجابة لم يكن كافيًا نهائيًا، مما تسبب في شعورهم بالضغط وعدم القدرة على مراجعة إجاباتهم بشكل جيد. وأشار آخرون إلى أن الامتحان لم يراعِ الفروق الفردية بين الطلاب، مما زاد من صعوبة المادة.\nوعلى الجانب الآخر، جاءت آراء طلاب الشعبة الأدبية أكثر إيجابية تجاه امتحان مادة التاريخ، حيث أكد الغالبية أن الأسئلة كانت مباشرة وفي مستوى الطالب المتوسط، وتنوعت بين الفهم والحفظ، كما أبدوا ارتياحهم من الوقت المخصص للامتحان، مشيرين إلى أنه كان كافيًا لحل جميع الأسئلة ومراجعتها بدقة.\nويترقب أولياء الأمور وطلاب الثانوية العامة بمحافظة الفيوم ما ستسفر عنه الأيام المقبلة من امتحانات، وسط دعوات بتيسير الأسئلة ومراعاة الضغوط النفسية التي يواجهها الطلاب في ظل نظام الامتحانات الموحد.",
