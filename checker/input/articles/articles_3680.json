    "text": "Alysha Newman has her sights set on crossing an even higher bar. The 29-year-old London, Ont., native is just a week removed from resetting her national record in the women's pole vault in Rouen, France, at 4.83 metres. She now heads into the world athletics indoor championships in Glasgow, Scotland looking to break it again. \"That's in my head. I want to break the Canadian record again and I want to try out that pole,\" Newman said. \"I'm like itching to jump on that pole again because I know that pole will launch me in the air and we found a pole that is going to work for me through between a 4.80 to a 4.90. \"It's exciting because those are numbers that win Olympic medals and so that's exciting, but it's still gotta be executed.\" The championships go from Friday to Sunday, with the women's pole vault final taking place Saturday evening local time. Newman views it as a good opportunity to compete against the very best in the world in her event. \"It's a big meet and it's a prep for Olympics,\" she said. \"Those top 12 girls that are competing at indoor worlds, you're going to see those women at the Olympics and to know that if you could be on the podium this weekend, that you're in really good shape. \"But again, the Olympics is, what, five months away? Six months away. A lot can happen in that.\" Newman has been incredibly active to start the year, competing in 11 events since January, including two 60-metre sprints. She has shown consistent progression, already putting forth four 4.70-plus jumps, including her new national record. She had four such jumps all of last season. Consistency has been the name of the game for Newman, who's been using new poles. \"Before you think even about being an Olympic gold medallist or an Olympic medallist, you have to figure out how you're going to be consistent, and then how you're going to be consistently jumping higher than all the other girls,\" she said. \"And I think a lot of my mistakes in the past was I would jump high once and I'd be like, 'OK, I can get this, I'll do it again.' \"But if we're realistic, you know, I'm not a superhero. I am a human. And you have to be able to jump, you know, 4.85 multiple times on a bad day to then jump a 4.95 or a five metres on your best day.\" Newman had a bounceback 2023 season, after years of dealing with injury and the pandemic, in which she won the world indoor tour final in February, before setting a national championship meet record (4.73) in July. However, she fell short of making the worlds final in August. \"Alysha was in good shape,\" coach Zdenek Krykorka said. \"She happened to scratch the pole in one of the jumps, then we started to panic (with) what pole she was supposed to be on, so just too many things happened at the same time. Unfortunately in the biggest meet of the year.\" But he feels Newman will shock some people this year. \"She started this year on a high note and she just keeps going up,\" he said. \"And I just believe, it doesn't need to stop there. … I think she is ready to surprise a lot of people.\" Newman has dealt with numerous doubters since she last set the national record in 2019, but has found ease in the confidence from those around her. \"A lot of outsiders are like, 'Is Alysha Newman done, is she not competing,'\" Newman said. \"But when you surround yourself with coaches and people that absolutely see your potential, it makes it a lot easier. \"Athletics Canada after 2022, they asked me if I should retire. They sent me our sports psych (Dr. Penny Werthner) and they came and try to have a conversation with me … and (she) said, 'Alysha, I think you should be done.' And it was just shocking because they're my organization, you would think that they would be on my side.\" Admitting she went off talent from 2020-2023, Newman says she has fallen back in love with sport. \"I think I'm saying a lot of 'no's' to excess things that I used to do,\" she said. \"I'm calling it like my selfish era. I've just been really having a good time. \"I just want to pole vault and I haven't felt like that since 2019.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 29, 2024.

    "text": "Nueva York. Estados Unidos. El estado de Nueva York demandó a 13 de los principales fabricantes y distribuidores de cigarrillos electrónicos o vapeadores por fomentar una “epidemia de vapeo entre los jóvenes”, anunció este jueves la fiscal estatal, Letitia James.\nLa fiscal neoyorquina -un cargo electo en las urnas - reclama a dichas empresas “cientos de millones de dólares” por los daños y perjuicios ocasionados, la recuperación de todos los ingresos obtenidos por la actividad ilegal y la creación de un fondo de reducción para hacer frente a la crisis del vapeo juvenil en Nueva York.\nLa industria del cigarrillo electrónico “engaña” a los jóvenes haciendo que la “nicotina parezca genial, enganchando a los niños, y creando una crisis masiva de salud pública”, alega la fiscal.\nAcusa a empresas como Puff Bar, Elf Bar, Geek Bar, Breeze, MYLE Vape, Pod Juice algunas de las trece demandadas, de “comercializar productos de nicotina altamente adictivos, con sabor a caramelo y fruta, a consumidores menores de edad”.\nAsimismo, “engañan a los clientes sobre la seguridad y legalidad de sus productos” utilizando estrategias que antes usaba la industria tabacalera, y “violan las regulaciones sanitarias diseñadas para frenar el vapeo juvenil”.\nPara ello, utilizan envases brillantes y coloridos, sabores de caramelos y frutas, campañas en redes sociales y de influencers, y afirmaciones no probadas de que sus productos son alternativas “seguras” a los cigarrillos, aduce.\nPese a que Nueva York prohibió la venta de productos de vapor aromatizados en 2020, empresas han seguido vendiéndolos y distribuyéndolos, recuerda la fiscal demócrata.\nTampoco la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de Estados Unidos ha autorizado los vapeadores con sabor a fruta o caramelo, recuerda.\nSegún la Asociación Americana del Pulmón, algunos ingredientes de los vapeadores causan daños pulmonares irreversibles. Los niños que consumen productos con nicotina también corren un mayor riesgo de adicción a otras drogas en el futuro.\n“Durante demasiado tiempo, estas empresas han hecho caso omiso de nuestras leyes con el fin de sacar provecho de nuestros jóvenes”, concluye la fiscal que libra desde hace tiempo una batalla sin cuartel contra las empresas de cigarrillos electrónicos.\nEn abril de 2023, el fabricante estadounidense Juul acordó pagar 462 millones de dólares a seis estados por comercializar estos productos entre los jóvenes.",

    "title": "Malaysian artist uses banana fiber and clay as a novel material to make bricks | The Star",
    "text": "Artist Cheng Yen Pheng, 42, gets excited whenever she comes across discarded banana tree trunks or clay soil around her neighbourhood. These rather mundane items are valuable for the local artist who is known to turn natural resources into material for her artistic creations.\nRecognising their potential, Cheng upcycles banana fibre into paper and also incorporates the fibre into clay bricks that she makes.\nSince early this year, Cheng has embarked on a journey of creating bricks made from clay, banana fibre, and sand.\nFrom banana fibre to clay, Cheng turns local resources into sustainable art. It all began when she stumbled upon a large amount of clay soil left unused at a former construction site near her home in Batu Arang, Selangor.\nRather than letting it go to waste, Cheng had an “A-ha moment” and saw it as an opportunity to repurpose the raw material and incorporate it in her artistic creations.\n“Seeing all that clay soil from the construction site gave me an idea. I noticed that some neighbourhood folk had used the clay soil for their vegetable plots, but there was still a lot left. So, I thought, why not use it for art?”\nSo, Cheng began researching a bunch of things, including about earth ovens and she stumbled upon videos about brickmaking using natural materials like clay.\n“I learned the basics of building earthen ovens from a friend in Batu Arang,” she explains. “He had experience with earthen ovens and taught me the techniques involved. It took about a month to build my first oven in my verandah,” she says proudly.\nCheng mixes clay soil, banana fibre, and sand to create sustainable bricks. (Right) Banana fibre can be crafted into decorative items, adding a natural and sustainable touch to home decor.\nCheng’s verandah is what you would imagine an artist’s haven to look like. Filled with things – from raw material like clay bricks, fresh banana stems, and dried banana fibre to the tools she uses in her creative process and finished artwork placed here and there – the space is a dynamic enclave.\nCheng says that she draws inspiration from artists in places she has visited like Chiang Mai, Thailand who utilise local resources for their artwork. And so, she decided to do the same and experiment with making clay bricks herself.\n“I mix the clay soil with dried banana fibre and sand to improve its texture and structural integrity. The banana fibre acts as a natural binder, holding the clay together. The secret lies in finding the right consistency of the mixture. Once that’s achieved, it is placed in a mould and left to dry for a few days,” explains the Penang-born artist, who has been living in Batu Arang for eight years now.\nBuilding blocks\nDuring the Tukang Festival in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, last month, Cheng got visitors to get their hands dirty and handcraft bricks.\n“A group of volunteers and I made 200 bricks for an installation! I invited people to play with the mud and appreciate its qualities. It was an experimental art project, aimed at reconnecting adults with the earth through hands-on play.”\nLooking ahead, Cheng hopes to involve her community in Batu Arang, where a brick factory once thrived in colonial times.\n“There’s a rich history here. During the British rule, coal and bricks were vital industries; now they’re almost forgotten. I hope to revive that heritage through community workshops, where we can explore sustainable ways of using local resources like clay.”\nCheng plans to hold community workshops in Batu Arang to educate people on sustainable ways of using local resources like clay.\nCheng was the recipient of the 2019 UOB Painting of the Year (Malaysia) competition. She also received the 2020 Cultural Economic Development Agency (Cendana) Visual Arts Inspire Funding Programme, which has enabled her to conduct research on local arts, crafts of the communities in Terengganu.\nShe has had nearly 20 exhibitions (group and solo) in the past two decades.\nAs an artist, Cheng likes to experiment with different materials: She’s worked with metal, sandpaper, wood and now clay and banana fibre.\nCheng says she never knew the value nor did she appreciate the versatility of the banana plant till she attended an art residency programme in Fukuoka, Japan last year.\nThe bark of the banana tree is thinly sliced, boiled and pounded to make paper. Photo: The Star/Muhammad Shahril\n“During the programme, I visited Mino in Gifu Prefecture, which is well-known for its 1,300-year history as a Japanese paper industry town. It is known for making washi mulberry paper.\n“The Japanese crafters were happy to meet me, a Malaysian, and we discussed Malaysia’s wealth of plant resources suitable for papermaking. It was during this encounter that I first learned about using banana fibre to make paper. Ironically, it took crafters from another part of the world to educate me on the versatility of the banana plant, a resource we have in abundance but often overlook,” says Cheng, who holds a diploma in fine art from Dasein Academy of Art in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe meeting with these Japanese crafters inspired the mother-of-one to research the material further and explore how banana fibre could be used in her art projects.\n“By researching and exploring these resources, we can learn to upcycle materials and reduce our carbon footprint,” shares Cheng, who uploads photos and videos of her work on Facebook .\nBack to basics\nEven though she only recently learnt about banana fibre, Cheng has been using natural resources in her work, trying different ways to innovate and use them in creating sustainable art. Since 2019, she has been crafting mulberry paper from the trunks of mulberry trees grown in her spacious garden. Cheng also conducts mulberry paper-making workshops in her home.\nTo make mulberry paper, branches from mulberry trees are meticulously peeled by hand. The bark is then air-dried, then left to ferment before being boiled for a few hours. Once softened, the bark is pounded.\nAfter another round of fermentation, it is filtered in water, and placed into a square wire mesh wooden frame. Finally, the paper-to-be is left to dry.\nThis process typically takes between 10 and 20 days, depending on the weather.\nThe process of transforming mulberry branches into paper takes place in Cheng’s garden.\nA similar process is used to make banana paper.\n“In Malaysia, we are blessed with an abundance of raw materials. Natural fibres such as banana trunks, mulberry trunks, and bamboo are all ideal for papermaking. “Clay deposits are perfect for crafting ceramic items. Vibrant dyes sourced from local plants can be used to colour fabrics.\n“But, despite this wealth of materials, we have yet to fully tap into their potential and promote their use in traditional or contemporary crafts,” she says.\nMulberry paper is known for its strength, durability, and smooth texture, making it ideal for various artistic and practical uses. It is her hope that more people will learn how to use different types of wood to make paper so that we can promote sustainability and also foster innovation in eco-friendly paper production methods. “The mulberry tree is versatile and easy to grow. It’s a hardy tree. Its leaves can be used to make tea, and its fruits are rich in antioxidants.\n“The bark is utilised for making paper, while I turn the branches and trunks into charcoal that I use for drawing. Nothing goes to waste.“Plus, by making my own mulberry paper, I save money on buying paper for my art projects, whether it is sculpting, in collages, and also my paintings. The bottomline is that I can stretch the ringgit further,” she says. Through her workshops, Cheng also aims to educate people about appreciating nature and handmade items. She believes there is greater fulfillment in creating items than simply purchasing them.\nCheng with two youngsters during her workshops at the Tukang Festival at The Spine, Petaling Jaya recently. Photo: The Star/Azlina Abdullah\n“In the busy rat race of modern life, people often overlook the value of craftsmanship.\n“We must slow down, take time to touch, and truly appreciate the process of making things from scratch.\n“It is important to foster an environment that encourages and supports people to explore crafts.\nThis can help foster a culture of creativity and appreciation for our rich heritage.”\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

    "title": "THORChain hits unwanted $3B volume milestone as Bybit hackers revive activity on the struggling network",
    "text": "THORChain, a cross-chain swap protocol, witnessed a huge uptick in its activity as the party behind the Bybit heist attempted to launder stolen funds through the platform.\nThe Bybit heist now tagged the largest cryptocurrency heist the world has ever seen, happened on February 21, 2025, and saw the exchange lose about $1.46 million in ETH and a smattering of other tokens.\nAccording to the FBI and other on-chain sleuths, the North Korean Lazarus Group was behind the hack, so the consensus is that the same group attempted to clean the stolen funds through THORChain.\nThe hackers most likely opted for THORChain because of its decentralized nature, which helped them launder their stolen funds while protecting their identities.\nTheir activity has thrown the protocol into the public eye once more. However, THORchain needs not such negative attention as it struggling to stay afloat. It even had to pause lending operations earlier this year in a proactive attempt to prevent mass exit.\nOn-chain analyst Yu Jin claims the hackers converted the stolen Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) via THORChain, which resulted in the generation network’s trading volume reaching $2.91 billion and earning the protocol $3 million in fees.\nPrior to the North Korean hackers using the platform to clean their dirty money, THORChain’s average daily transaction volume was about $80 million. However, when the laundering started from February 22 onward, that figure started rising rapidly, crossing an average of $580 million per day and totaling $2.91 billion in just five days.\nOn February 26 alone, data from THORChain explorer revealed THORChain processed $859.61 million in swaps, its highest-ever daily volume, and added $210 million more on February 27, bringing the total to over $1 billion within 48 hours.\nIf there was any doubt that the hack had something to do with the Lazarus Group, the decision to swap the Bybit funds for Bitcoin fits the North Korea-linked group’s modus operandi.\nTHORChain core developer and Nine Realms engineer going by the “Pluto” pseudonym acknowledged via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that illicit funds had indeed passed through the protocol.\n“When we first started seeing illicit flows on THORChain, our team bridged the gap for wallets and integration partners, helping them integrate screening services like @elliptic,” Pluto began in his post.\nHe added that the team is actively working with wallet and integration partners to implement screening services to address this issue.\n“Everyone needs to work together to make a best effort at stopping these flows to the best of our ability without compromising L1 integrity,” Pluto also wrote. “It’s our job as L1 operators to ensure the 2nd and 3rd layers (aggregators and frontends) conform with industry best practices.”\nAccording to Pluto, if they don’t provide such guidance, governments will try to shut down L1s, which would deprive the world of “valuable public utility infrastructure.”\nThe Bybit hack is now being considered a stress test on the ecosystem as it trudges toward mainstream adoption. In the past, word of such an event would have triggered mass panic on both the parts of the investors and service providers, but the industry went a different route this time.\nBybit’s CEO Ben Zhou took a transparent approach, revealing what happened and reassuring its users that funds were safe even though there was withdrawal congestion. In the aftermath of the hack, Bybit also witnessed a show of solidarity from other exchanges, including Binance, who loaned it money to keep its withdrawals going.\nMany other exchanges and crypto entities have stepped in to help retrieve and freeze the stolen funds since then. Bybit also acknowledged THORChain’s effort in a post. The X post noted that THORChain blacklisted addresses linked to the hackers, but there is no clear evidence that the protocol stopped the hackers from laundering funds.\nOne thing that is certain is that THORChain’s permissionless and decentralized nature was pivotal to the hackers’ decision to use it to launder funds even though its transparency aided tracking efforts.\nSo, were the hackers able to get the stolen funds off THORChain? The answer is yes, but they did not get away with it without complications. They were able to clean significant amounts of the stolen assets—at least $250 million (100,000 ETH) within days, with some estimates suggesting up to 20% of the total amount (about $292 million) was processed by February 25.\nTo get it out, they swapped the ETH to BTC, DAI, and other assets; then they split the funds across multiple wallets to avoid getting detected. It was smart but their moves were not hidden. Thanks to blockchain transparency, firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic were able to trace the fund movements, leading to some being frozen.\nSo far, Chainalysis has reported $40 million seized, and $42.85 million was frozen via coordinated efforts. Despite all the freezes and retrievals, reports claim the hackers still hold a substantial amount of ETH that far surpasses the holdings of prominent figures like the chain’s developer, Vitalik Buterin.\nThe situation remains precarious, with the hackers racing to get their stolen funds off-chain. Bybit, supported by the authorities, continues to intensify efforts to retrieve its funds or track down the hackers.\nCryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

    "title": "El azulgrana Ian Barrufet debuta en la Bundesliga siendo líder con el Melsungen",
    "text": "La Bundesliga, la NBA del balonmano, la mejor Liga de clubs de este deporte, ha alzado este jueves el telón de la temporada 2024-25 con tres partidos y su primer líder es el MT Melsungen del azulgrana Ian Barrufet gracias a su victoria por ocho goles sobre el Lemgo (20-28). Ian, hijo del legendario portero del 'Dream Team' David Barrufet, firmó recientemente su primer contrato profesional con el Barça hasta 2027, pero esta temporada está cedido al Melsungen para disponer de más minutos que contribuyan a su crecimiento como jugador. El extremo izquierdo azulgrana, de 20 años, entró en las categorías inferiores del Barça en 2016 como jugador del infantil B y, desde entonces, está cubriendo perfectamente todas sus etapas, también con la selección española, pues forma parte del equipo liderado por los hermanos Petar y Djordje Cikusa que han enlazado tres oros los tres últimos veranos, en el Europeo sub-18 (2022), el Mundial sub-19 (2023) y el Europeo sub-20 (2024). Barrufet, que ha marcado dos goles en su primer partido en la Bundesliga, también tendrá la oportunidad de foguearse esta temporada en la Liga Europea EHF porque el Melsungen se ganó su plaza en la segunda competición continental tras acabar 5º en la Liga alemana. Dirigido por el técnico español Roberto García Parrondo, el Melsungen aspira a estar arriba en ambos torneos porque ha reforzado su primera línea con Aaron Mensing, Alexandre Cavalcanti, Mohamed Amine y Nikolaj Enderleit. En su competitiva plantilla ya estaban Dainis Kristopans, Rogerio Moraes, Adrian Sipos, Erik Balenciaga o Timo Kastening. Por su parte, el THW Kiel ha hecho dos de los grandes fichajes del año con el portero alemán Andy Wolff, procedente del Kielce, y el lateral derecho danés Emil Madsen (GOG), pero ahora mismo le asola una plaga de lesiones y ha empezado la Bundesliga perdiendo contra el Rhein-Neckar Löwen (32-27). Eso sí, Madsen ya ha dejado su primer sello de calidad al marcar 10 goles, los mismos que el fichaje estrella de los 'Leones', el croata Ivan Martinovic. En el otro encuentro del día, el Gummersbach se ha impuesto en la pista del Hannover por 28-32, con cinco tantos de su principal incorporación, el francés Kentin Mahé, procedente del Veszprem húngaro.",

    "text": "Frank Townsend has been involved in the banking business for nearly 40 years.\nHe currently serves as the executive vice president and chief lending officer for The Southern Bank, which has a new branch in Aiken.\nTownsend cut the ribbon late Wednesday afternoon during the branch’s grand opening celebration.\n“I’m just excited to get back to being a community banker and joining a team of bankers that I’ve known for a long time,” Townsend said. “We’re thrilled to expand into the Aiken market, and we want to be the community bank of choice in Aiken.\"\nThe Southern Bank has $300 million in total assets. In addition to Aiken, there are offices/branches in South Carolina in Greenville and Spartanburg along with locations in Georgia.\n“We have a branch staff [in Aiken] of five, including me,” Townsend said. “We’re a full-service bank with the technology and online banking.”\nTownsend has been an executive with The Southern Bank since December 2021. Prior to then, he was the city executive for Aiken for SouthState Bank and also worked for other banks.\nIn recent years, “four regional banks have closed downtown [offices] in Aiken,” Townsend said. “The thought that we needed another community bank presence downtown made me want to join this bank.”\nThe Southern Bank’s Aiken branch began welcoming customers in early January at 108 Barnwell Ave. N.W. in the renovated former home of a South Carolina Electric & Gas business office.\n“We scheduled our grand opening and ribbon-cutting for our board meeting today,” Townsend said.\nThe Southern Bank’s CEO, Jamin Hujik, spoke briefly before Townsend cut the ribbon.\n“Our tagline is modern banking with a Southern accent, and when you walk into this branch, you’re going to get just that right here,” Townsend said.\nAccording to a news release, The Southern Bank opened its Spartanburg branch, which also serves as Southern Financial Corporation’s headquarters, in August of last year.\nSouthern Financial Corporation is the holding company for The Southern Bank.",
