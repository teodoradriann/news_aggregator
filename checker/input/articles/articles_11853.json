    "text": "Audio relacionado En entrevista para MVS Noticias con Manuel López San Martín, [José Manuel del Río Virgen](https://mvsnoticias.com/video/2021/12/23/un-ano-de-prision-preventiva-jose-manuel-del-rio-540325.html), Secretario Técnico de la JUCOPO en el Senado de la República, habló sobre el proyecto \"Inocencia\" que apoya a personas en situación de cárcel. De acuerdo con sus declaraciones tuvo el acercamiento a este proyecto desde que viajó a San Diego, California, y ahí supo que fue impulsado desde un inicio por la Universidad de Tel Aviv, en Israel, así que lo que él hizo fue hacerle algunos ajustes y ponerlo en marcha en el estado de Veracruz, la entidad en la que estuvo preso hace algunos años por una injusticia. \"En Veracruz de cada 100 que detiene la policía a 90 los jueces de control le aplican la prisión preventiva oficiosa... Nos dimos cuenta de eso y eso nos llevó a calcular que más o menos de los 7 mil personas privadas de la libertad que hay en las cárceles veracruzanas, calculamos que tres mil 500 por lo menos son personas que han servido como chivos expiatorios al sistema de justicia estatal\", explicó. Te podría interesar José Manuel del Río Virgen detalló que gracias a este proyecto han logrado que 91 personas de la cárcel de Pacho Viejo, en Veracruz, recuperen su libertad. Asimismo destacó que en promedio en dicho penal hay al menos 900 personas que están presas injustamente. \"En el proyecto \"Inocencia\" solamente defendemos a las personas que pensamos, creemos y sostenemos que son inocentes porque el proyecto no permite cobrar ni un sólo peso, no cobramos absolutamente nada...\", detalló. Te podría interesar José Manuel del Río Virgen fue víctima del estado de Veracruz En otro orden de ideas, el político mexicano dio a conocer que la CNDH les otorgó 30 recomendaciones contra el gobierno del estado de Veracruz, donde señala que la cárcel de tránsito que está en el puerto y es conocida como \"El Penalito\" viola los derechos humanos de los reos. Por último, al ser cuestionado sobre si después de haber salido de prisión, donde estuvo 6 meses encerrado, en el 2021, José Manuel del Río Virgen dijo que la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas, que es un órgano que depende de la Secretaría de Gobernación, finalmente lo reconoció como víctima del gobierno del estado de Veracruz y la Fiscalía emitió dos recomendaciones sobre su inocencia, al igual que la CNDH.",

    "text": "Pepiot shrugs off illness, stifles Angels in Rays' narrow win ST. PETERSBURG -- [Ryan Pepiot](https://www.mlb.com/player/686752) knew something was off when he looked in the mirror not too long before he took the mound at Tropicana Field on Thursday afternoon. Pepiot felt fine in the days leading up to the Rays’ series finale against the Angels, but when he saw his reflection before his start, he looked sick. So he threw up and threw six strong innings, anyway. The right-hander struck out seven and set the tone with his second quality start of the season in the Rays’ [2-1 win](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/angels-vs-rays/2024/04/18/745104/final/box). “Pretty strong performance,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “I don't think he felt that well going into the game. It's amazing how sometimes people find out they got that extra gear, and he certainly put it in.” Pepiot said it wasn’t food poisoning or anything related to his nerves, just a “weird” bug that left him “a little tired, a little exhausted” on the mound. He didn’t pitch like anything was wrong, though. “I was going to take the ball no matter what. I like to compete. No matter how you feel, you get 30 of them,” Pepiot said. “There’s some you’re going to feel great, some you’re not going to feel great, and today just happened to be one of those that you don’t feel great. Go out there, respond and battle.” Pepiot did exactly that, holding the Angels to just one run, three singles and three walks. They only had one at-bat with a runner in scoring position against him, and Pepiot neutralized the threat by retiring Nolan Schanuel to end the second inning. The lone mark against Pepiot came in the sixth due almost solely to the work of -- who else? -- Mike Trout. Pepiot walked Trout to begin the inning, then the Angels superstar stole second and third base to put himself in position to score on a Miguel Sanó sacrifice fly. It was Trout’s first multi-steal game since July 23, 2018, and his first inning with multiple stolen bases since May 20, 2018, also against Tampa Bay. “The kid that was out there for them was throwing the ball pretty good,” Angels manager Ron Washington said. “We just needed a big hit but didn’t get it. And after that, he and the rest of their bullpen held us down.” Leaning mostly on his fastball and slider, the right-hander forced the Angels to swing and miss on 17 of their 44 swings (39%), the third-highest swinging-strike total of his young career. After seeing the Angels take some good swings on his changeup early in the game, Pepiot and catcher René Pinto relied more on his slider. It produced 10 whiffs, the most in any outing of his career. “He throws a lot of strikes, and he just pitches with a confidence that you don't always see for a young starting pitcher with not too many starts in the big leagues,” reliever Colin Poche said. “It's good to see, because he's a guy we're gonna count on going forward a lot.” The Rays needed Pepiot to be at his best, because their lineup went silent after a quick rally in the first inning. Richie Palacios worked a one-out walk against Angels starter Griffin Canning, then Amed Rosario extended his hitting streak to 10 games with an RBI triple to right field. Up came Harold Ramírez, who lofted a sacrifice fly to right to give the Rays a 2-0 lead. “He's kind of that guy in the lineup that you want up there right now, if you [could] hand-pick somebody to be up there with guys on base,” Cash said of Rosario, who leads the Majors with 40 triples since 2018. “He's giving good at-bats and hitting balls hard and hitting balls soft that are finding hits.” For all their recent heavy workloads and [late-inning issues](https://www.mlb.com/rays/news/pete-fairbanks-blows-save-spoiling-rays-late-comeback), including a blown save by closer Pete Fairbanks on Wednesday night, the Rays bullpen worked through the final innings unscathed in the series finale. Aside from the just-promoted lefty Jacob Lopez, Cash said, the three relievers who followed Pepiot to the mound were the only ones available Thursday. Fortunately for the Rays, they got the job done. Garrett Cleavinger struck out two in a clean seventh. Phil Maton worked around a hit (and Trout) in the eighth. Then Poche navigated through a pair of singles to earn his second save, secure the Rays’ eighth consecutive season series victory over the Angels and finish a 4-3 homestand heading into a weekend showdown with the Yankees in the Bronx. “Big win for us. Anytime you play the same team seven times in 10 days, it gets a little tough,” Poche said. “After a disappointing loss last night, quick turnaround with the day game, just a good win for us to take into the road trip.”",

    "text": "El camote tiene más potasio que el plátano y ayuda a cuidar la salud\nEl camote es un alimento conocido por su sabor dulce y su versatilidad en la cocina. Sin embargo, éstas no son sus únicas características, ya que, según la Clínica de la Universidad de Navarra, este tubérculo contiene más potasio que incluso los plátanos.\nAdemás, diversos estudios han demostrado que el camote tiene diversos beneficios a la salud humana como aportar nutrimentos esenciales, mejorar la función inmunológica y prevenir el daño vascular y cardiaco.\n¿El camote tiene más potasio que un plátano?\nDe acuerdo con la universidad española, el camote, también conocido como “patata dulce” o “batata” contiene más potasio que un plátano, ya que, según una tabla de alimentos ricos en este mineral mientras 100 gramos de plátano poseen 370 mg de potasio, 100 g de camote cuentan con 542 mg.\nEsto significa que en 100 g de camote hay 172 mg más de potasio que en 100 g de plátano. Incluso, las espinacas crudas, el aguacate y el ajo tienen mucho más potasio que un plátano.\nBeneficios del camote a la salud\nUna dieta rica en potasio ayuda a contrarrestar algunos de los efectos nocivos del sodio sobre la presión arterial y es esencial para el correcto funcionamientos del organismo.\nOtros beneficios del camote a la salud, según un estudio publicado en la revista especializada Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnología Postcosecha, son:\n- Mejora la función inmunológica\n- Previene el daño vascular y cardiaco\n- Protege al hígado\n- Mejora las funciones de las células hepáticas\n- Suprime el crecimiento de células malignas para el ser humano, interfiriendo en el metabolismo de lípidos\n- Disminuye los niveles de azúcar en sangre\n- Reduce las ulceras gástricas\n.Además varios estudios han informado que los antioxidantes provenientes del camote desempeñan un papel importante en la prevención del envejecimiento y las enfermedades relacionadas con la edad.\nPro otro lado, la deficiencia de potasio puede reducir el calcio en los huesos y aumentar el riesgo de cálculos renales.\n¿Qué es el potasio?\nEl potasio es un mineral de tipo de electrolito que ayuda a la función de los nervios y a la contracción de los músculos, así como a mantener el ritmo cardiaco constante.\nSegún los expertos, el potasio también permite que los nutrientes fluyan a las células y a expulsar los desechos de éstas.\nOtras fuentes ricas en potasio\nEntre las principales fuentes de potasio que se pueden consumir están:\n- Verduras de hoja verde (espinacas y col rizada)\n- Frutos de las vides (uvas y las moras)\n- Vegetales de raíz o tubérculos (zanahorias y papas)\n- Frutas cítricas (naranjas)\nLa Universidad de Navarra en España, ofrece una tabla en la que se muestra la cantidad de potasio que poseen algunos alimentos:",

    "text": "The Missouri General Assembly has introduced legislation this session to combat misleading or deceptive practices related to the wood industry.\nSB 760, carried by Senator Jamie Burger and HB 1537, carried by Representative Tony Harbison, both aim to stop sellers from selling products they claim are wood, when in reality the product is synthetic wood.\nOne of the biggest reasons behind the bill is to help protect Missouri’s wood industry.\nWhile not often thought of when it comes to Missouri’s agricultural industries, the forest industry is much larger than the average Missourian might think. Missouri’s forest products are valued at $10 billion dollars and the industry employs over 42,000 Missourians across the state. This includes sawmill workers, lumber workers and even flooring producers.\nAccording to Missouri Forest Products Association Executive Director Brian Brookshire, when these sellers use deceptive tactics to market their products as real wood to consumers, it can seriously affect the entire forest products industry in the state. But he says it can also harm consumers.\n“These bills represent a victory, both for the forest products industry in the state of Missouri and most importantly, consumers,” Brookshire said. “Knowing the difference between real hardwood and synthetic wood products will allow Missouri consumers to make informed decisions and support a state-wide, multi-billion dollar industry.”\nAccording to Brookshire, when consumers get duped into buying synthetic wood products instead of real wood products, they are unknowingly settling for lower quality, harming their projects and in some cases, even risking their health.\nThe most common and easy-to-understand example of this issue is the flooring market.\nThere are vast differences between synthetic wood flooring and real wood flooring. Although usually cheaper, synthetic wood flooring is not as durable as wood and will significantly degrade over time. Wood flooring can also increase the value of a house. Wood flooring is also obviously made of wood, meaning it is completely sustainable and can easily be turned into other products later on. Whereas synthetic wood flooring is often not recyclable and has to be burned, which can be harmful to the environment. According to the EPA, wood flooring is also better for your health since synthetic flooring is more likely to harbor dangerous microorganisms and allergens.\nBut for Brookshire, it’s more than knowing the difference between the two products. According to him, consumers should have the right to choose what they buy, but they also deserve the right to know what they are buying when they buy it, not when problems crop up in the future.\nHe believes these bills are a good way to help stop this issue.\nSpecifically, these bills would bar “any person advertising or selling wood products” from “misrepresenting a product as a wood product if the product is not derived or harvested from wood”, protecting both the industry and the consumer from deceptive marketing tactics.\nCurrently, both bills have been referred to committee.",

    "text": "The first few minutes of Live with Kelly and Mark took an uncomfortable turn as viewers got a glimpse into Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos’ marriage.\nThe show started with the couple walking out together and dancing to the music like always. Their energies didn’t match each other; maybe that was a clue about what was coming.\nKelly was hyper, dancing a little more, giving an extra shimmy, and as she sat down, she drummed her hands on the table.\nHowever, Mark sat down and sighed as the “Previously Recorded” signage flashed on the screen. Another clue for fans that maybe this was taped after an already draining live episode.\nMark took the lead and introduced a list of phrases you can use with others instead of pretending to agree with someone.\nAfter just a sentence or two of small talk, Mark went in heavily on Kelly as he read off a list of phrases he nicknamed: “Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?”\nKelly warned Mark she was getting irritated, and he kept going anyway\nKelly excitedly exclaimed, “I need this!” Then things took a dark turn.\nMark spoke authoritatively and started reading, “I understand your viewpoint, but I see it another way.”\nKelly bristled at that line and said, “I’m not going to lie. This irritates me.” Her body language changed, and she started tapping her foot.\nKelly had an irritated scowl on her face, and Mark just laughed at her irritation.\nKelly did not like what she called a “non-apology” list of phrases as Mark kept reading.\nHe took a moment to comment on her legs, which were “going nuts under the table,” as he put it. Then he told Kelly, “You are like a little chihuahua.” And he repeated it.\nAll Kelly could do was put an irritated smile on her face. Her eyes did not lie – she didn’t like how this was going.\nKelly and Mark butt heads with each other on the show often\nThis month alone, Kelly and Mark have been going head-to-head a lot.\nAs previously reported on Monsters and Critics, Kelly lost a football bet with Mark and had to pay up live on the show.\nShe had to eat a Cuban sandwich after her team, the Philadephia Eagles, lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The segment where Kelly eats the sandwich is posted on Mark’s Instagram.\nThen, earlier this week, Mark showed off his favorite new gift, a pipe. He became a new person with the gestures and authoritative way he started pointing the pipe at Kelly.\nKelly was having none of it and threatened to come at him with a machete if he kept pointing the pipe at her.\nThey seem to be getting on each other’s nerves more often than they used to, which could mean bad things for their marriage.\nThey work so closely together each weekday on Live that they may need a break from each other.\nLive with Kelly and Mark airs weekdays on ABC.",

Des coupures ont été signalées à Mexico, dans l'Etat de Mexico voisin et ceux du Michoacán (ouest), du Tamaulipas (nord-ouest) et Campeche (sud-est). La Commission nationale de l'eau a fait état de températures \"maximales de 48 degrés et plus dans les régions de San Luis Potosi (nord-est) et Tamaulipas\". En avril dernier, la température à Mexico a atteint les 34,2°C, battant le record de 33,9°C atteint en 1998 (33,9°C), d'après la Conagua. \"Il y a eu une demande supérieure à la capacité produite\", a reconnu jeudi le président mexicain Andrés Manuel López Obrador, qui a lancé pendant son mandat une réforme énergétique pour renforcer la part de la Commission fédérale d'électricité (CFE, publique) dans la production totale. Le Costa Rica et l'Equateur ont également annoncé des rationnements d'électricité. La vague de chaleur au Mexique a fait baisser le niveau d'eau de plusieurs barrages dans le pays.",
