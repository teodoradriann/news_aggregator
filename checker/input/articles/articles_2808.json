    "title": "Turismo: Victoria Villarruel se reunió con referentes del sector en Bariloche",
    "text": "La vicepresidenta Victoria Villarruel se reunió esta tarde con empresarios del sector turístico en Bariloche para discutir sobre el nivel de ocupación de la temporada , la proyección de la ciudad como destino, la política de cielos abiertos y otros puntos claves que afectan a la actividad.\nEl contenido al que quiere acceder es exclusivo para suscriptores.\nsuscribirse ya estoy suscripto La presidenta del Senado fue recibida por el ministro de Gobierno de Río Negro, Federico Lutz y por el nuevo secretario de Turismo provincial, Marcos Barberis. Del encuentro también participaron empresarios de la Cámara de Comercio, de la Federación de Empresas y Entidades de Bariloche, de la Cámara de Turismo, de la Asociación Empresaria Hotelera y Gastronómica, y de la Asociación de Agencias de Viajes y del Bureau Bariloche.\nInformate más Senado: se desplazó a Unión por la Patria de la conformación de comisiones Javier Milei insistió con las SAD para el fútbol argentino: \"Son un negocio fácil\" Según trascendió, los referentes del sector turístico le pidieron a Villarruel la designación de un funcionario en la cartera de Turismo para tener un interlocutor en el Gobierno con el que poder dialogar sobre las preocupaciones principales de la actividad.\nDesde La Libertad Avanza desminitieron los rumores de reunión entre Villarruel y Macri en el Sur A pesar de los rumores de que la Vicepresidenta también se había reunido con Mauricio Macri en su country Cumelén de Villa La Angostura, desde La Libertad Avanza rápidamente desmintieron esa información.\nHoras antes, el dirigente social y líder del Frente Patria Grande, Juan Grabois , denunció una \"conspiración\" entre Macri y Villarruel para \"voltear\" a Milei y quedarse con el Gobierno.\nAgencias de viajes y turismo pidieron la inconstitucionalidad del DNU de Javier Milei Uno de los sectores más preocupados por las primeras medidas del oficialismo es el turístico. En las últimas horas, la Federación Argentina de Asociaciones de Empresas de Viajes y Turismo (Faevyt) , que representa a todas las agencias de viajes argentinas, presentó un amparo mediante el cual solicitó que la Justicia declare la inconstitucionalidad del DNU 70/2023 en el punto en el cual pretende derogar el régimen general de los agentes de viajes (Ley 18.829).\n“Es fundamental resaltar que la derogación del régimen de agentes de viajes impacta directamente sobre los derechos adquiridos por las empresas de viajes y turismo que, cumpliendo con esta ley, brindan seguridad a los pasajeros y estabilidad al sector \", dijo el presidente de esa entidad, Andrés Deyá , a través de un comunicado.\nEn ese sentido agregó que \"la desaparición de esta norma promovería una competencia absolutamente desleal con personas que no son profesionales de la actividad turística y que no tendrán ningún control para cumplir correctamente con su labor ni brindar ningún tipo de garantía a los pasajeros ”.",

    "title": "House Democrats Are Still Going After the Trump Family With Baseless Attacks",
    "text": "Even though Donald Trump left the White House years ago, Democrats still relentlessly go after him and his family for what they perceive to be some sort of influence in a desperate attempt to distract from the influence of [the Biden crime family](https://townhall.com/tags/biden-crime-family), especially when it comes to First Son Hunter Biden's shady business dealings. During Wednesday's House Oversight Committee on \"Defending America from the Chinese Communist Party’s Political Warfare,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA), a particularly relentless member when it comes to attacking Trump and his family, brought up Ivanka Trump and her supposed involvement in China. \"The Trump Crime family took foreign bribes and illegal gifts while in the White House – and now post-presidency,\" Garcia claimed in an X post, where he also included a clip of his use of time during the hearing. He even used harsh language, asking, \"Where's that damn investigation?\" \"In April of 2017, with Trump's White House in chaos, many people, including the Chinese government, were all trying to gain influence,\" Garcia claimed. \"During this time, Ivanka Trump was working in the White House, got preliminary approval for three Chinese trademarks on the same day that Donald Trump had dinner with XI Jinping at Mar-A-Lago. And remember, Ivanka never divested her company while she was working in the White House,\" he continued, specifically targeting the former president's oldest daughter.\" The Trump Crime family took foreign bribes and illegal gifts while in the White House - and now post presidency.— Congressman Robert Garcia (@RepRobertGarcia) Where’s that damn investigation? [https://t.co/coJl0VSjY3] [June 26, 2024] The moment was enough to earn a headline from Mediaite declaring, \" [Democrat Nukes Trump And His Daughter Ivanka For Profiting Off 'Favors' From China While In White House](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/democrat-nukes-trump-and-his-daughter-ivanka-for-profiting-off-favors-from-china-while-in-white-house/).\" Recommended A spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said in a statement to Townhall, \"These claims are demonstrably false.\" Some key context for Ivanka Trump's trademarks came from a 2017 article from the Washington Post, \" [From diet pills to underwear: Chinese firms scramble to grab Ivanka Trump trademark](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/from-diet-pills-to-underwear-chinese-firms-scramble-to-grab-ivanka-trump-trademark/2017/02/24/9a6ecea4-fa96-11e6-9b3e-ed886f4f4825_story.html).\" She was looking to prevent the Chinese from profiting off of her. It was a move that many were jumping at the chance for, with hundreds of applications. As the piece mentions: Chinese companies have been scrambling to add [Ivanka's] name to their products since her father won the U.S. presidential election in November. There’s even a new Chinese cosmetic-surgery firm offering the chance to look a little more like her. An astounding 258 trademark applications were lodged under variations of Ivanka, Ivanka Trump and similar-sounding Chinese characters between Nov. 10 and the end of last year, records at the China Trademark Office show. None appear to have a direct business link with the U.S. president’s daughter. ... Other applications have been lodged for “Ivanka,” “Ivanka Trump,” and a few for the characters 依万卡, which also spell yiwanka. ... Taking advantage of — or faking — foreign brands is common in China, as is the practice of “trademark squatting,” whereby someone preemptively registers a spurious trademark claim in the hope of later being paid to relinquish it. Regarding Garcia's claim that \"Ivanka never divested her company while she was working in the White House,\" a CNN article from January 2017, right before Trump took office, tells a different story. \" [Ivanka Trump goes further than her father in divestment](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/ivanka-trump-divestment-donald-trump/index.html),\" the headline reads, with the piece specifically mentioning her company: “She wants to go beyond what her father did, because she doesn’t believe he has to deal with conflicts, she wants to. The reason she wants to? She plans to be a ‘modern-day first daughter,’” said Monica Langley, a CNN political analyst and senior special writer at the Wall Street Journal. “She’s going to be in the West Wing and be one of his top advisers.” Ivanka Trump is taking a formal leave of absence from the Trump Organization and her apparel and accessories brand when her father assumes office, she wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday. “I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company,” she wrote. There was also backlash against Garcia's claims from Alex Bruesewitz as well as Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX). Bruesewitz held nothing back as he claimed Garcia \"is rivaling Eric Swalwell for the dumbest member of Congress award now that Adam Kinzinger is gone,\" and that Garcia \"blatantly LIED\" with such claims. \"She simply registered trademarks in China to prevent the Chinese from profiting off of her name. She makes NO money in China,\" Bruesewitz offered about Ivanka. He also brought the conversation back to the Biden family, adding, \"Crackhead Hunter Biden took in millions from the CCP and 10% (probably more) went to the 'Big Guy,'\" a title [used to refer to](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2024/02/23/bobulinski-n2635593) then Vice President Joe Biden, as former Hunter Biden associate Tony Bobulinski [has made clear](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2024/02/23/bobulinski-n2635593).

    "text": "Labor has said the Tories are “writing off” young people, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term illness” doubling since 2010.\nSir Keir Starmer's party said that in 2010/11, 116,000 young people aged 16 to 24 were out of work or were not looking for employment due to long-term illness.\nThe party said the number of people unemployed now stands at 235,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the whole of Britain.\nShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: “By ignoring the essential foundations for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.”\nThe Labor MP said his party would ensure young people do not fall through the cracks between services and government departments.\nShe hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers' rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity.\nMs Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis faced by many of our young people.\n“We will transform mental health services, reduce NHS waiting lists, boost skills, strengthen employment rights and provide tailored job support.”\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both called for getting people of all ages back into the workplace to boost labor supply across the UK.\nThe proportion of people out of work has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but the problem is also seen to be driven by wider factors, including rising levels of disability and long-term illness.\nA government spokesperson said: “We are reducing inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of reducing youth unemployment by 43% since 2010.\n“We are investing £2.3 billion in mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to take part in education and apprenticeships.\n“More broadly our Back to Work scheme will help people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or who are long-term unemployed to get into and stay in work.”\nA Conservative spokesman accused Labor of having a “brass neck”, saying that the party had “never left office with lower unemployment than it inherited”.\nSource: uk.finance.yahoo.com",
