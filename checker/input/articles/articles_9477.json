More content below BYND TSN WMT MAT MCD YUM TGT\nCooking up change in a well-entrenched, well-capitalized industry isn't easy.\nSuch is the story of the ticker symbol BYND, formally known down supermarket aisles across America as Beyond Meat ( BYND ).\nWhile the price of Beyond Meat stock has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown hasn’t. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry exec remains laser-focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n\"We believe the arc of history is on our side and that we're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after,\" Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above).\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business. Beyond Meat burst onto investors' radar on May 5, 2019, with a sizzling initial public offering on the Nasdaq.\nInvestors devoured shares of a company they saw as the leader in the budding plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite, May 2, 2019, in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images) From there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with big deals with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts ( YUM ), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target ( TGT ) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items.\nBy July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival Impossible Foods .\nAlong the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce.\nStory continues Then in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter.\nThird quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis.\n\"You know that there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and particularly after the IPO, that it was going to happen overnight,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round of layoffs. \"That obviously has not proven to be the case.\"\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: Surround yourself with great people, have that long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course. \"But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it's the health angle, whether it's climate, whether it's the energy and water use or animal welfare,\" Brown continued. \"All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.\"\nToday, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for meat king Tyson ( TSN ), per Yahoo Finance comparison data .\n\"In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),\" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said.\nGoldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) about the path forward for the plant-based meat company inside its new El Segundo, Calif., headquarters. (Yahoo Finance) Meanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie maker Mattel ( MAT ). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.\nThe new facility even has a McDonald’s ( MCD ) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often makes the rounds in the building to chat up employees with his trademark cool, welcoming vibe.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be easy and he isn't yet in the mindset to reflect on the path of the business to this point. But he will not be deterred in his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and hustle.\n\"I have to see [my mission] through to completion,\" Brown said. \"I think it'll be something [that] when it's said and done, I might look back. But right now I'm in the fight, so it's hard to see.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn .

    "text": "Le Premier ministre britannique, appelant à ne pas se \"relâcher\" après les émeutes qui ont secoué le pays, a annoncé qu'il présiderait ce jeudi 8 août une nouvelle réunion de crise avec de hauts responsables de la police. Le calme avant la tempête? Le Premier ministre britannique Keir Starmer a appelé ce jeudi 8 août à ne pas \"relâcher\" les efforts contre les violences d'extrême droite après l'accalmie que le Royaume-Uni a connue mercredi soir.\nLà où les forces de l'ordre redoutaient des dizaines de nouveaux rassemblements anti-immigration et des éruptions de violences mercredi soir, des milliers de personnes ont manifesté dans plusieurs villes pour marquer leur opposition au racisme et à l'islamophobie .\n\"Il est important que nous ne nous relâchions pas\", a déclaré le chef du gouvernement britannique aux télévisions, annonçant qu'il présiderait jeudi une nouvelle réunion de crise avec de hauts responsables de la police, la troisième depuis le début de la semaine.\nSi la soirée de mercredi s'est passée \"bien mieux qu'attendu\", \"nous n'allons pas abandonner nos efforts\", a-t-il poursuivi, martelant son message de fermeté, après avoir visité une mosquée à Solihull (centre de l'Angleterre). De son côté, le maire de Londres Sadiq Khan a remercié dans un message sur X ceux qui ont manifesté pacifiquement pour montrer que la capitale est \"unie contre le racisme et l'islamophobie\", ainsi que les policiers \"héroïques qui travaillent jour et nuit pour assurer la sécurité des Londoniens\".\n\"Stop à l'extrême droite\" \"Je vis dans le quartier et nous ne voulons pas de ces gens (d'extrême droite) dans nos rues... Ils ne nous représentent pas\", a affirmé à l'AFP Sara Tresilian, 58 ans, parmi les milliers de personnes manifestants mercredi soir dans le quartier londonien de Walthamstow.\nMilitants de l'association Stand Up To Racism et habitants, arborant parfois des drapeaux palestiniens, ont brandi des pancartes \"Stop à l'extrême droite\" et \"Réfugiés bienvenus\", en opposition frontale avec les actes hostiles depuis une semaine ciblant mosquées ou hôtels hébergeant des demandeurs d'asile.\nLe chef de la police de Londres Mark Rowley s'est dit jeudi matin \"vraiment ravi de la manière dont les choses se sont passées\" grâce au déploiement policier et à la population.\nIl a salué, devant des journalistes, la \"démonstration d'unité\", même si \"dans quelques endroits des délinquants locaux sont venus\" pour se livrer à des actes \"antisociaux\".\nÀ Birmingham (centre), des centaines de personnes se sont rassemblées devant un centre d'aide aux migrants. Sur des vidéos de l'AFP, on entend des slogans comme \"Disons-le haut et fort, les réfugiés sont les bienvenus ici\". Certains tenaient des pancartes sur lesquelles était écrit \"Le fascisme n'est pas le bienvenu\".\nD'autres rassemblements se sont dispersés dans le calme dans nombre d'autre villes, de Brighton (sud) à Bristol (ouest), en passant par Liverpool (nord).\nCinq arrestations à Belfast ce mercredi Des tensions ont toutefois éclaté sporadiquement, comme à Aldershot (sud) où selon l'agence de presse britannique PA la police a dû s'interposer entre des militants antiracistes et un groupe de personnes qui criaient \"Arrêtez les bateaux\", en référence aux migrants qui arrivent au Royaume-Uni par la Manche sur des bateaux pneumatiques.\nÀ Belfast, la police a annoncé avoir procédé à cinq arrestations après des violences mercredi, lors d'une soirée marquée par de nouveaux actes racistes. Alors que le parlement local se réunit jeudi en raison de la crise, la Première ministre nord-irlandaise Michelle O'Neill a souligné qu'il n'y a \"aucune place pour le racisme sous aucune forme dans notre société\".\nPlus de 400 personnes ont été arrêtées depuis le début des heurts et plus de 120 personnes ont été inculpées en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles, selon le parquet. Les premières condamnations, allant jusqu'à trois ans de prison, ont commencé à tomber mercredi. Jeudi, deux hommes arrêtés lors d'incidents la semaine dernière ont été condamnés à deux ans et huit mois de prison.\nDepuis une semaine, le Royaume-Uni a connu des scènes de violences racistes, après la circulation d'informations en partie démenties sur le profil de l'auteur présumé d'une attaque au couteau dans un cours de danse, où trois fillettes de 6 à 9 ans ont été tuées à Southport (nord-ouest de l'Angleterre).\nSur le même sujet Émeutes au Royaume-Uni: les autorités soupçonnent des comptes russophones d’amplifier les fake news Le suspect a été présenté comme un demandeur d'asile de confession musulmane. Il est en fait né à Cardiff, au Pays de Galles, et sa famille est selon les médias britanniques originaire du Rwanda.\nJ.Bro avec AFP Les plus lus\nJO 2024 (triathlon): l'eau de la Seine était-elle trop polluée le jour de l'épreuve de relais mixte?",

She also qualified in the 2012 London Games, but for the second straight time, came home empty-handed.\nIt wasn’t until the 2016 edition of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro when Diaz, an Air Force officer, finally scored a breakthrough by winning the silver medal in the women’s 53-kilogram category, ending the country’s medal-less campaign for two decades in what proved to be a prelude to a historic golden feat in Tokyo four years after.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "Pablo Javier Piacente\n22 NOV 2024 11:00 Actualizada 22 NOV 2024 11:29 Desde el auge de la Inteligencia Artificial (IA), y más aún luego de la popularización de ChatGPT y otras aplicaciones de chatbot, la demanda de algunas especialidades laborales relacionadas con la creación de contenidos, la programación o la entrada de datos ha sufrido un importante descenso, según un nuevo estudio. Los resultados confirman que se requerirá una combinación de nuevas estrategias profesionales por parte de los trabajadores y de iniciativas de seguridad social encaradas por estados y organizaciones civiles para reducir el impacto de los cambios.\nUn equipo de científicos de la Universidad de Harvard, en Estados Unidos, el Instituto Alemán de Investigación Económica y el Imperial College de Londres, en el Reino Unido, estudiaron casi un millón y medio de puestos de trabajo solicitados en un importante portal de profesionales independientes a nivel global, desde julio de 2021 hasta julio de 2023, y revelaron que la demanda de las posiciones freelance propensas a la automatización cayó un 21%, solamente ocho meses después del lanzamiento de ChatGPT, a fines de 2022.\nNoticias relacionadas\nLa IA puede procesar ilusiones ópticas como lo hace el cerebro humano ¿Estamos listos para ser la segunda especie más inteligente del planeta? El documento, publicado en OpenRead y SSRN, analiza el impacto de las tecnologías de Inteligencia Artificial (IA) en la demanda de trabajadores independientes online utilizando un gran conjunto de datos de una plataforma líder, cuyo nombre no fue revelado. Los científicos identificaron los tipos de trabajos que se ven más afectados por la IA generativa y cuantificaron la magnitud del impacto en ese mercado laboral específico.\nUn fuerte impacto Los hallazgos muestran una disminución del 21% en el número de puestos de trabajo con posibilidad de ser automatizados mediante la IA , principalmente en las tareas de carácter más rutinario ligadas a la creación y redacción de contenidos, la codificación y programación, el diseño y el ingreso de datos, entre otras especialidades.\nAnalizando en concreto algunos detalles, observaron que la introducción de tecnologías de IA para la generación de imágenes condujo a una disminución significativa del 17% en el número de puestos de trabajo relacionados con la producción visual para proyectos digitales. A través de la herramienta Google Trends, pudieron demostrar que la disminución más pronunciada en la demanda de profesionales freelance dentro de los secores indicados se relaciona directamente con el crecimiento de la popularidad y el concimiento de las potencialidades de ChatGPT y otros sistemas similares.\nDesafíos y nuevas oportunidades al mismo tiempo Según un artículo publicado en Fast Company, los especialistas sostienen que los responsables de políticas públicas y directores de organizaciones sociales deberán promover el acceso equitativo a oportunidades de educación y capacitación, apoyar a los trabajadores desplazados a través de redes de seguridad social y llevar adelante programas de reempleo , entre otras posibles medidas.\nPor último, TechRadar informa que los investigadores subrayaron en el estudio que aunque el mercado laboral parece sombrío para algunas especialidades, al mismo tiempo surgirán nuevas profesiones , como ya ha sucedido durante cambios tecnológicos previos. Al mismo tiempo, muchos profesionales lograrán adaptar sus habilidades al nuevo entorno y mantendrán sus empleos, saliendo incluso fortalecidos al volcarse a tareas más creativas o analíticas , que la IA aún no logra dominar.\nReferencia Who is AI Replacing?

    "text": "It can be difficult to run a long distance, especially if it’s your first marathon. Some runners neglect to pay attention to their diets while pushing the boundaries of their physical endurance in preparation for the big day. It can be confusing to know what to eat in advance of a marathon and how much fuel to consume before, during, and after the run. Luckily, you can figure out what your body needs to finish the race by paying attention to your nutrition, staying hydrated, and doing some experimentation during your preparation. In addition to assisting you in optimizing your performance, this will facilitate your journey toward success. Prepare yourself for success Having a good eating plan is just as vital as your running strategy. Selecting foods high in nutrients is a smart move when training. A diet high in oily meals and samosas will not make you perform at your best. A well-balanced marathon diet should include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats. Carbohydrates are the macronutrient on which you should concentrate the most. Protein is also essential because it supports lean muscle, aids in healing, and helps avoid injuries. Hydrate yourself prior to, during, and after your runs. In order to get ready for the next training session, you must adequately hydrate and restore nutrients after each one. Be smart about your meals Many runners eat pasta during the pre-race meal in order to consume a lot of carbohydrates; if that suits you, by all means, do it, but remember to eat in moderation. Try eating meals that are low in fat, fiber, and spice and heavy in carbohydrates and moderate protein. Moreover, you can experiment with more nutritious carbs like whole grains and veggies. Furthermore, don’t forget to eat throughout the days preceding the marathon; dinner is not the only chance you have to fill up on carbohydrates. It’s also critical to keep in mind that people start losing muscle mass around the age of 40 and can lose up to 8% every ten years. This can assist you in obtaining the necessary quantity of protein to prevent your body from using your muscles as fuel for exercise. Do not take a chance Consume what you have consumed on extended training runs. Before your run, you can consider ingesting 25 to 50 grams of carbs every hour. Additionally, resist the urge to sample a new bar you came across that day. For lengthy runs, stay with what you have been trained with. Minor adjustments to your nutrition or increased fluid intake throughout the race can have a detrimental effect on your time. Ensure you eat breakfast and pack wisely Your pre-workout food offers numerous advantages. It suppresses appetite, avoids low blood sugar and associated side effects (dizziness, weariness, and impaired vision), and gives your muscles energy. This meal’s timing is crucial. Food consumed prior to exercise becomes beneficial only after it has had time to break down and absorb. Eat a meal three to four hours before working out, or have a smaller snack one to two hours beforehand, if possible. Depending on your energy demands, whole wheat bread with egg and fruit juice can be a terrific pre-run breakfast. Pack extra water, energy bars, sports drink, recovery nourishment for after the race, and any other meals you often consume on mornings when you go on a long run. It’s beneficial to have energy. 108980990",
