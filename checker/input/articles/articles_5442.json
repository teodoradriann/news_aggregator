    "text": "Si usted es amante de la naturaleza y de la flora y fauna del país, no puede dejar de visitar Nuquí, un municipio localizado en el golfo de Tribuga, en el departamento del Chocó, en medio de un paisaje de un verde profundo, lleno de selva y ríos.Para llegar allí, usted debe tomar un vuelo desde Medellín hasta su pequeño aeropuerto, en donde los guías de la región le mostrarán en dónde puede tomar la lancha que lo llevará a su sitio de hospedaje. ¿Qué hay por hacer en Nuquí? Descubrir Nuquí puede tomar varios días, los cuales puede aprovechar para disfrutar un turismo experiencial al lado de una exótica flora y fauna, que lo hará salir de su rutina diaria y gozar de un paisaje único.De acuerdo con el portal Colombia Travel, estas son algunas de las experiencias de las que puede disfrutar mientras se encuentra en Nuquí:Desde que llega a este paraíso tropical, podrá sentir la tranquilidad del lugar al recorrer las diferentes playas de Nuquí, entre las que se encuentran: Guachalito, Coquí, Joví, Termales y Morromico.Playa Blanca es un sitio particular porque su arena es blanca, a diferencia de las demás, en donde su arena es normalmente más oscura, el cual es ideal para hacer careteo, puesto que hay mucha variedad de peces, algunos corales.Si lo que quiere es un poco más de acción a su viaje, puede practicar deportes como el surfing , aprovechando las fuertes olas que durante algunas horas golpean las playas, y el buceo, con el que podrá apreciar la riqueza del océano Pacífico.También puede ser la oportunidad para acercarse a la pesca artesanal junto a los expertos en el tema y aprovechar para conocer un poco más acerca de la cultura local y disfrutar de la deliciosa gastronomía de la región. Senderismo por los bosques también es una gran alternativa y pasando por riachuelos que bajan por la selva hasta desembocar en el mar.Otra de las atracciones que existen en esta región es hacer un recorrido en chingo (embarcaciones de madera elaboradas por los habitantes locales) por el río, mientras observa los tipos de manglares y la diversidad de la flora y de la fauna.Otra experiencia incomparable es la de navegar por el río Joví, practicando kayak y recorrer el sendero acuático Pichindé, bañándose en las refrescantes aguas templadas de la Cascada del Amor o de la Cascada la Roñosa, una caída de agua de 30 metros de altura, en un entorno de selva primaria bordeada por el litoral Pacífico.De acuerdo con este mismo portal de referencia, no puede dejar de visitar el Parque Nacional Natural Utría, ubicado muy cerca de Playa Blanca, para conocer más sobre la vida de las ballenas y su migración, así como observar una gran variedad de reptiles y monos.A lo largo de una bella caminata por la playa desde Guachalito se llega al corregimiento de Termales, el cual cuenta con un lugar ideal para desconectarse y relajarse en medio de la selva. Es un sitio en donde las aguas provienen de fuentes submarinas que se encausan en este bello termal, el cual es cuidado por la comunidad de Termales. Es el momento ideal para dejar atrás el estrés y entrar en un profundo contacto con la naturaleza.Las ballenas jorobadas viajan cada año desde Chile hasta Canadá, en Colombia las ballenas hacen una parada muy especial en la ensenada de Utría porque es allí, en sus cálidas aguas donde dan a luz a su una única cría, la cual cuidan por varios años.",

The event on June 3, 2024, was not open to journalists.\nThe nature of the remarks in the surreptitiously obtained recordings has renewed discussion about Justice Alito’s impartiality – Windsor’s goal in making the recording – and raised questions about journalistic ethics. But the recordings also highlight two significant problems society faces.\nFirst is the reality of pervasive, electronic surveillance today: Everyone wears or carries one or more always-on smart devices embedded with highly sophisticated audio- and visual-sensing capabilities. The microphones and cameras in people’s smartphones and smartwatches record, collect and share their communications, locations and activities. Even for the rare person who avoids such devices, they are still typically surrounded by others’ devices.\nSecond is the failure of U.S. law’s once-robust electronic surveillance legal framework embodied in the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act , commonly referred to as the Wiretap Act, and state counterparts to keep pace in the era of smart devices. The weakened surveillance protections are coupled with the legislative failure to protect data privacy.\nI am an attorney and law professor at the University of Richmond’s School of Law, and these laws and issues are the focus of my legal practice and research as lead author of “ Wiretapping & Eavesdropping ”, a four-volume work covering privacy and electronic surveillance law.\nElectronic surveillance laws make it a crime to use a “device” to surreptitiously record or intercept communications, like email and oral conversation, without consent. Doing so, whether remotely or in person, is sometimes referred to as wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping . From the nature of Samuel and Martha-Ann Alito’s remarks, it appears they were unaware they were being recorded. So, did this undercover advocacy journalist violate wiretapping laws?\n From a legal standpoint, the facts about who was being recorded, how they were being recorded and where they were being recorded matter. If someone is aware they are being recorded – and continues speaking – or has consented to being recorded, the recording is usually lawful.\nThe Wiretap Act and some state counterparts, including the District of Columbia’s law, permit recording if one person in a conversation consents , even if other participants in that conversation are unaware that they are being recorded. In other words, if you’re speaking privately with someone, you take the risk that they may be recording you, even if they deceive you about who they are, as Windsor did in this case, and as undercover agents do all the time.\nSome states, like Maryland , require the consent of all people in a private communication to record it. Wiretapping and eavesdropping laws also consider whether a communication or conversation is private, considering where and how it takes place. If it occurs in a public place where others can hear what is being said, it is usually not private and not protected.\nWhat device did Lauren Windsor use? She could have used a small, sophisticated device specifically designed for electronic eavesdropping, or she could have used her phone. It doesn’t really matter under the law. It was a device, and virtually everyone, of their own accord, carries highly sophisticated listening and recording devices in the form of smartphones and smartwatches.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\nComments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Share",

    "title": "FirstEnergy Corp Reports Strong First Quarter 2025 Financial Results | FE stock news",
    "text": "Summary\nFirstEnergy Corp (FE, Financial) announced its first quarter 2025 financial results on April 23, 2025, reporting a notable increase in both GAAP and Core Earnings compared to the previous year. The company achieved GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and Core Earnings of $0.67 per share, up from $0.44 and $0.49 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024. FirstEnergy is progressing with its $5 billion investment plan for 2025, part of the larger $28 billion Energize365 program through 2029, and has reaffirmed its full-year 2025 Core Earnings guidance.\nPositive Aspects\n- FirstEnergy reported a significant increase in first quarter 2025 GAAP earnings to $0.62 per share, up from $0.44 per share in 2024.\n- Core Earnings improved to $0.67 per share from $0.49 per share in the previous year.\n- The company is on track with its $5 billion investment plan for 2025, focusing on customer-centric capital investments.\n- FirstEnergy affirmed its full-year 2025 Core Earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\n- Distribution deliveries increased by more than 4% compared to the first quarter of 2024.\nNegative Aspects\n- Industrial sales decreased by nearly 3% compared to the previous year.\n- Core Earnings in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment decreased by $0.04 per share due to dilution from the FET equity interest investment.\n- Higher operating expenses were noted due to increased maintenance requirements and deferred cost recovery.\nFinancial Analyst Perspective\nFrom a financial analyst's viewpoint, FirstEnergy's first quarter results demonstrate strong financial discipline and effective execution of its regulated strategies. The significant year-over-year improvement in both GAAP and Core Earnings indicates robust operational performance. The company's commitment to its investment plan and reaffirmation of its earnings guidance suggest confidence in its growth trajectory. However, the decline in industrial sales and increased operating expenses warrant close monitoring as potential areas of concern.\nMarket Research Analyst Perspective\nAs a market research analyst, FirstEnergy's strategic focus on customer-centric investments and its Energize365 program positions the company well for long-term growth. The increase in residential and commercial sales reflects a positive demand trend, although the decline in industrial sales could indicate sector-specific challenges. The company's ability to maintain its earnings guidance amidst these dynamics will be crucial for sustaining investor confidence and market positioning.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: What were FirstEnergy's first quarter 2025 GAAP earnings per share?\nA: FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2025.\nQ: How much did FirstEnergy's Core Earnings improve compared to the first quarter of 2024?\nA: Core Earnings improved to $0.67 per share from $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2024.\nQ: What is the total investment plan under the Energize365 program?\nA: The Energize365 program includes a $28 billion capital investment plan through 2029.\nQ: Did FirstEnergy affirm its full-year 2025 Core Earnings guidance?\nA: Yes, FirstEnergy reaffirmed its full-year 2025 Core Earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\nQ: What was the percentage increase in distribution deliveries compared to the first quarter of 2024?\nA: Distribution deliveries increased by more than 4% compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n Read the original press release here.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

    "text": "News All the Animals at This Shelter Were Adopted for the First Time in 47 Years All 598 animals in the shelter's care have been adopted and 125 strays were reunited with their owners By Scout Richards Published on 12/28/2023 at 2:41 PM\nFacebook / Adams County SPCA Facebook / Adams County SPCA For the first time in 47 years, the Adams County SPCA in Pennsylvania had all of its animals adopted.\n'To say that we are beyond excited is an understatement! The staff and volunteers have worked VERY hard to take care of the animals in our care and to make sure they got adopted to the right home,' the shelter posted on Facebook on December 22.\nThe shelter said that it was almost at capacity in early December. But now, all 598 animals in its care have been adopted and 125 strays were reunited with their owners.\n'It has been a busy year! We thank everyone for their continued support and look forward to new adventures in 2024,' the shelter said. 'We will be pulling animals from other shelters in PA next week in hopes of relieving some of their stress. Right now, we are going to enjoy this accomplishment! Merry Christmas!'\nAccording to the ASPCA, around 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized annually. That number has dropped from approx 2.6 million animals in 2011. The organization explained that decrease is partly due to a rise in adoptions and strays being successfully reunited with their owners.",
