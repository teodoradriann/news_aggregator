    "title": "Fact Check: There Are NOT 53 Pennsylvania Voters Registered At Vacant Address -- Nuns Live There",
    "text": "STORY UPDATED: check for [updates below](#breaking-updates).\nAre 53 voters registered at an Erie, Pennsylvania, address where no one lives? No, that's not true: The address corresponds to a monastery. The Benedictine Sisters of Erie have said publicly that they live there.\nThe claim appeared in an article (archived here) on X on October 22, 2024, on the official X account of Cliff Mahoney, leader of The Pennsylvania Chase campaign. The post, which included a video of a list of voters, was captioned:\nBREAKING: a member of the PA CHASE discovered an address in Erie, PA today where 53 voters are registered.\nTurns out it's the Benedictine Sisters of Erie and NO ONE lives there.\nWe knocked on the door because a Republican mail-in ballot is unreturned.\nOur attorney's are reviewing this right now.\nWe will not let the Dems count on illegal votes.\nThis is what the post looked like on X at the time of writing:\n(Source: X screenshot taken on Thu Oct 24 14:41:09 2024 UTC)\nDespite the post's claim about the supposedly vacant address, the Benedictine Sisters of Erie live at the address shown on the list of voters in the post. The address is 6101 E Lake Road in Erie, Pennsylvania. Lead Stories used Google to search for the address (archived https://archive.ph/LFqeU) and confirmed that the monastery is located there.\nLead Stories contacted the Sisters for comment on the claim. We received a written statement dated October 23, 2024 (also found online https://eriebenedictines.org/news-stories.html/article/2024/10/23/press-release-benedictine-sisters-subject-of-fraudulent-claims (archived https://archive.ph/E6Mz2)] which read in part:\n'We want to call Cliff Mahoney to account for his blatantly false post that accuses our sisters of fraud. We do live at Mount Saint Benedict Monastery and a simple web search would alert him to our active presence in a number of ministries in Erie. We also want to alert those who subscribe to X and other social media platforms to be vigilant and seek additional information before accepting these posts as truth,' said Sister Stephanie Schmidt, prioress.\nAdditionally, the names of the voters in the video included in the post that made the claim match a list of the Sisters available online (archived https://archive.ph/XFzVu).\nLead Stories received an email on October 24, 2024, from Amy Gulli, director of communications for the Pennsylvania Department of State, which administers election procedures. Gulli informed us that Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt called the prioress of the Sisters, Stephanie Schmidt (no relation), on October 24, 2024, to thank her for \"standing up against election disinformation.\" Gulli shared an additional statement from Sec. Schmidt:\n'Those of us in election administration have been urging people to rely only on trusted sources of information. The good Sisters are definitely trusted sources,' Secretary Schmidt said. 'I thank them for courageously speaking up about being the targets of fraudulent claims regarding their voter eligibility. They have turned a regrettable experience into an opportunity to remind all of us to be \"discerning and conscientious\" consumers of election information.'\nOther Lead Stories fact checks related to the 2024 U.S. general election can be found https://leadstories.com/elections/.\nUpdates:\n-\n2024-10-24T20:16:09Z 2024-10-24T20:16:09Z Added online version of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie's statement and added statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State.",

    "title": "Ex-Wimbledon champ identifies reason behind Emma Raducanu's devastating US Open exit",
    "text": "2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli thought Emma Raducanu looked like she was \"almost not present\" out there in the first set versus Sofia Kenin and that put the the 2021 US Open winner in a very uncomfortable and difficult position considering the opponent she was playing against.\nIn a battle between two Grand Slam champions, it was 2020 Australian Open champion Kenin who beat Raducanu 6-1 3-6 6-4 in the US Open first round.\nRight from the start of the match, it was Kenin who controlled everything. And even though the 25-year-old American missed out on two break points in the opening game, she kept pressing and still dominantly took the first set after winning six games in a row.\nIn the second set, Raducanu bounced back a little bit and managed to force a decider after breaking Kenin three times and losing her serve once. But in the third set, Kenin consolidated - and after saving a break point in the second game - the former world No. 4 got the lone break of the decider in the fifth game and then routinely held on to her serve for the rest of the match.\nAfterward, Raducanu got emotional and started crying while speaking about how heartbroken she felt over losing early at Flushing Meadows.\n“I felt that the first set for Emma went by in a flash, she was almost not present on the court. And then when you’re already one set down against someone who has been able to win a Grand Slam in the past, on a hard court and who loves these kinds of conditions, it’s such a difficult task,\" Bartoli told\nSky Sports.\n“Kenin was constantly rushing Emma, constantly on the front foot, dictating most of the play from the back of the court, specifically to disturb Emma, who never looked comfortable out there.”\n'Sad' Raducanu admitted she made some mistakes\nFollowing the loss, Raducanu was the first to admit that the opening set was a complete disaster for her and that she had trouble dealing with Kenin's shots and pace throughout the match. While making that clear, the 21-year-old Briton also got emotional and confessed to reporters that she felt \"down and sad.\"\n“I feel down, I feel sad. Obviously, this is a tournament I really want to do well in so… after the first set I was outplayed completely and I think I did well to equal it. The third set was pretty high-level tennis and I think certain parts of my game in dealing with her speed of shot, dealing with her pace, certain parts I actually executed better than in previous matches. I came across a very in-form opponent, and she played really well,\" Raducanu said after the match.\nBefore the US Open, many were pointing at the fact that Raducanu was healthy but still decided to play only one tournament leading up to the last Major of the year. And after the Kenin loss, the Briton also appeared to admit that it was a mistake and pretty much confirm that the criticism that came her way over the scheduling was justified.\n“I was maybe a bit slow starting. Yeah, I would have preferred to probably play, a little bit more before coming into the US Open. You know, I know when I have a lot of matches, just like every player, you feel really good. You feel like everything’s automatic. So yeah, I think I can learn from it. And you know my manage my schedule slightly differently,\" Raducanu admitted.\n“I’m just going to go back to the drawing board and train and analyze where I went wrong and try and improve for the rest of the season. Obviously the Slams are over for this year, but it’s not actually that long until Australia comes around again.\"\nTim Henman offers some empathy for Raducanu\nWhile Bartoli identified the reasons behind Raducanu's loss, Henman agreed that it wasn't the most memorable US Open for the Briton but explained that there was a lot to learn from that particular match. Then, former six-time Grand Slam semifinalist Henman noted that he still believes Raducanu is trending in the right direction with her game and improvement.\n“I still think her game is moving in the right direction. It’s certainly not the last we’ll see of Raducanu. Fingers-crossed she’s going to have many more opportunities here at the US Open in the future. It’s all a rebuilding process as she comes back from the surgeries [in 2023]. When she has played, she has played very well,\" Henman said.\nSince she herself mentioned it, Raducanu will now probably try to do some hard work on the practice court and try to fix her mistakes.\nOn September 16th, the WTA 500 event in Seoul is starting and Raducanu is scheduled to play there.",

Estas son 10 razones por las que deberías reconsiderarlo\nEn los resultados salió a flote que la principal razón por la que los trabajadores en el país no se desocupan al final de su jornada es por el jefe y sus propios compañeros.\nEllo, de acuerdo con la mayoría de respuestas: 6 de cada 10 trabajadores contaron que extienden su jornada de trabajo porque el jefe o los integrantes de su equipo los presionan u obligan a estar disponibles fuera del horario laboral.\n2 de cada 10 dijeron que en su empresa falta una cultura organizacional que promueva la desconexión; y 1 de cada 10 dijeron que en su equipo falta planeación, o que temen perder oportunidades.\nAsí, pareciera que el trabajador en México tiene complicado dar fin a su jornada diaria, para descansar y retomar sus labores al día siguiente. Sin embargo, los resultados del sondeo también dejan ver que quienes permiten que su jornada laboral se extienda, también se están ocasionando otros problemas de salud o personales.\nEl 46% de los consultados dijo que no desconectarse del trabajo al final de su jornada les incrementa el estrés; el 25% dijo que tiene problemas para conciliar el sueño.\nDe los restantes, el 23% dijeron que ven afectación en sus relaciones interpersonales, y 6% dijo que hay daño a su rendimiento y productividad.\n¿Ya nos tienes en Facebook?
