    "title": "En Italia, un nacimiento con dos mamás del niño Jesús genera controversia",
    "text": "Católicos y conservadores se han molestado con un nacimiento colocado en Italia en el que aparecen dos mujeres como madres del niño Jesús, en lugar de las figuras convencionales de María y José.\nEl incidente ocurrió en la iglesia de una aldea de la provincia de Avellino , ubicada a una hora al este de Nápoles, en Italia.\nEl belén generó controversia incluso en redes sociales, donde los internautas también dejaron sus comentarios, los cuales han sido divididos, ya que algunos han apoyado el nacimiento, mientras que otros lo consideraron una falta de respeto.\nCabe destacar que los nacimientos en Italia, como en casi todo el mundo, son muy populares aunque en los últimos años se han visto envueltos en guerras culturales a medida que la sociedad italiana se vuelve más laica y multicultural.\n| Reuters El párroco de la iglesia de los Santos Pedro y Pablo, en Capocastello di Mercogliano, defendió la representación del nacimiento de Jesús con las dos madres, y argumentó que buscaba mostrar que las familias ya no son solo las tradicionales.\n“Quería mostrar con esta escena que las familias ya no son sólo las tradicionales”, afirmó a Reuters el padre Vitaliano Della Sala.\n“En nuestras parroquias vemos cada vez más niños de los nuevos tipos de familias que existen y forman parte de nuestra sociedad, hijos de separados y divorciados, parejas homosexuales, solteros, madres jóvenes”, añadió el sacerdote.\nEl padre Della Sala es conocido por simpatizar con las causas LGBT y en más de una ocasión ha dicho que su actitud está con la línea del Papa Francisco, que esta semana dio el paso histórico de dar permiso a los sacerdotes para bendecir a parejas del mismo sexo.\nCatólicos critican el nacimiento con dos mujeres El senador Italiano Maurizio Gasparri, del partido cogobernante Forza Italia, dijo que el nacimiento con temática LGBT “ofende a todos aquellos que siempre han tenido respeto y devoción por la Sagrada Familia”.\nEl grupo Pro-Vita & Famiglia (Pro-Vida y Familia) lo calificó de “peligroso, además de vergonzoso y blasfemo”.\nIncluso lanzó una petición al obispo de Avellino para que intervenga y se quite el nacimiento que, aseguraron, “contradice las enseñanzas de la Iglesia sobre la familia y legitima la paternidad homosexual y los vientres de alquiler.\nDicha petición ha recibido más de 21 mil firmas.\nCon información de Reuters\n¡No te pierdas nuestro contenido, sigue a Fuerza Informativa Azteca en Google News!

    "title": "The warmest December in Snohomish County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Snohomish County, Washington from 1901-2000 was 33.9. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Snohomish County, Washington experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Snohomish County, Washington history.",

    "text": "The relocation and expansion of a farm in [Russell County](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/russell-county/) will result in a nearly $1 million investment that will create 12 new jobs. [Bates Family Farm](https://www.batesfamilyfarmllc.com/28/our-story.htm) will relocate its manufacturing facility to a 40,000 square foot building owned by Russell County to meet the growing consumer demand for its skincare products. The space should allow for the development of new products, additional production capacity and warehouse space. Bates Family Farm will also construct a new creamery to produce food products, bottled goat milk and artisan cheeses, for wholesale and retail distribution. The farm is committed to purchasing 100 percent of all expected agricultural products from Virginia, an increase of more than $2 million over the next three years as a result of this expansion. “I am pleased to see this AFID award assist in the relocation and expansion of Bates Family Farm, a Virginia home-grown, agricultural business, founded by one of our country’s veterans,” said Virginia Gov. [Glenn Youngkin](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/glenn-youngkin/). “This project increases economic development activity in Russell County, provides new jobs in a rural area, and demonstrates our support of the Commonwealth’s dairy industry and to Virginia’s entire agricultural community.” Shannon and Joseph Bates established Bates Family Farm in Russell County in 2013. The company produces a full line of goat milk-based skincare products to include soap, lotion, lip balm and body cream, that are sold in more than 1,000 retail stores and specialty shops across the U.S. “This AFID grant award and the support we have received from Russell County are critical factors in our decision to move forward with this project. We are honored to grow our business in the county we call home and be part of Virginia’s agricultural community,” said Bates Family Farm CEO Joseph Bates. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services worked with Russell County and the Russell County Industrial Development Authority to secure the project for the Commonwealth. Youngkin approved a $70,000 grant from the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development Fund, which Russell County will match with local funds. “Russell County is committed to continuing to focus on agribusiness as a growing and vital part of our local economy. This project will not only create jobs and investment in the county, but also grow the business’ contributions to local tax revenues,” said Russell County Industrial Development Authority Executive Director Ernie McFaddin.",

    "title": "'Empty Suit': Former Dem Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Slams Harris for Political 'Hypocrisy'",
    "text": "Former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday called Vice President Kamala Harris an \"empty suit,\" accusing the Democratic nominee of saying whatever is needed to win over voters without following through with action. \"Kamala Harris is an empty suit,\" Gabbard [said](https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-empty-suit-campaign-handlers-worried-says-tulsi-gabbard) on Fox News. \"Her campaign handlers are worried. ... They are trying to create this new version of Kamala Harris to match what their pollsters are telling them, so she can say whatever she needs to say to try to win over voters, which is the most offensive thing, I think, because they think we're so stupid as to forget what her record actually is.\" Gabbard’s remarks come as Harris faces [growing pressure](https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/kamala-who-has-no-policy-platform-will-deliver-economic-speech-thats-light-on-details/) from voters to enunciate her policy vision. CNN host Fareed Zakaria [noted](https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-beating-trump-vibes-says-cnn-host-fareed-zakaria) recently that the Harris campaign is \"heavy on vibes\" and \"seems deliberately light on substance.\" \"Voters choose from the gut and then rationalize their choice, consciously or not. Kamala Harris’s campaign seems premised on this latter, intuition-based approach,\" Zakaria wrote in a Saturday op-ed, noting that \"Harris has not yet given extensive interviews or done news conferences which would force her to detail her positions on specific issues.\" Gabbard, a former Democrat from Hawaii turned Independent, ran against Harris in the 2020 Democratic primary before both dropped out in 2019. Gabbard, in her interview Thursday, warned of Harris's past record of hypocrisy. \"We have to pay attention to [Harris’s] actions because on every single major issue, you will see that same kind of hypocrisy that I pointed out in 2019 where she’ll say one thing, but her record tells a very, very different story,\" Gabbard said. During a Democratic presidential debate in 2019, Gabbard pointed to Harris's history of preaching one thing while practicing another. \"Senator Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor,\" Gabbard said at the time. \"But she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\" Harris neither denied nor confirmed Gabbard’s claims, simply saying that she was \"proud of that work.\" Harris is slated to offer the first key insight into her policy platform during her economy-focused speech this Friday, with her campaign saying she will propose a first ever federal ban on food and grocery price gouging. The proposal would help Harris shift the blame for persistently high prices under the Biden-Harris administration on major corporations. \"The key thing here for voters as we head into this election is Kamala Harris will say whatever she thinks she needs to say,\" Gabbard said.
