    "text": "Students in England are now leaving university with average debts of £53,000 (nearly ₹62.43 lakh) according to new data from the Student Loans Company (SLC). The figure marks a 10% rise from last year’s average of £48,270 and reflects a growing dependence on loans to meet rising living expenses. The SLC’s latest release for the 2024–25 academic year reveals a stark gap in borrowing across the UK. In Scotland, where local students do not pay tuition, average debt is £17,000. In Northern Ireland it stands at £28,000, while students in Wales owe around £39,470 on average. More students working part-time As prices climb, many students are taking on paid work during term time to manage their finances. A survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute found that 68% of full-time students in the UK are now working, up from 56% a decade ago. The average working week is now 13 hours—more than at any time in the last ten years. Meanwhile, nearly 3 million graduates are repaying student loans. According to the SLC, 40% of those required to pay are making monthly repayments averaging £1,100 in 2024–25. The size of the student loan book in England has soared to £266 billion—up from £64 billion just ten years ago. It is expected to grow further, with the government planning to raise domestic tuition fees from £9,250 to £9,535 starting September 2025. Universities under pressure Despite the rise in fees and borrowing, universities are facing growing financial uncertainty. A recent report by the National Centre for Entrepreneurship in Education found that 25% of university leaders believe their institutions will need major restructuring to remain viable. Over half said financial stability was now their top concern, while 28% named international student enrolment as a priority. A separate study by the Tony Blair Institute noted that real-terms income from domestic tuition has dropped by nearly a third since 2012 due to inflation. The report warned that possible changes to student visa rules—such as a 6% levy on international fees, tighter compliance measures and reduced post-study work options—could disproportionately affect post-1992 universities that rely more heavily on international enrolments. “Universities with lower international rankings and former polytechnics had weaker finances and were most reliant on international students,” said Alexander Iosad from the institute. 61% of students borrow to pay rent Rising rent costs are placing further strain on students, particularly international ones. According to Graddinghomes.com, a global student accommodation platform, rent now consumes a larger share of student budgets than ever before. “Spending on student housing in the UK has jumped 15 per cent, driven by rising rents, an influx of international students and a growing preference for higher-end purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA),” Mamta Shekhawat, founder of Graddinghomes.com told Business Standard. “The 15 per cent increase in the proportion of student budgets dedicated to accommodation is a clear indicator of a worsening affordability crisis,” she added. “Without immediate and effective interventions, the rising cost of accommodation will continue to risk student wellbeing, academic success, and the fundamental principle of equitable access to higher education in the UK.” Of all students approaching Graddinghomes.com for UK housing, 52% were Indian. PBSA prices rising faster than maintenance loans The average cost of PBSA now stands at £13,595 per year for 2024–25, up from £11,500 in 2022–23—an 18% increase in just two years. In London, average monthly rent is £1,211, far above Northern Ireland’s £904. Nationally, rent rose 8% in early 2025. In cities like London, Manchester and Edinburgh, annual increases have ranged from 8% to 12%. Though PBSA comes with amenities like en-suite bathrooms and common spaces, its cost often outpaces available loans. In London, the maximum maintenance loan is £13,348, falling short of average rent for PBSA. To bridge the gap: 61% of students have borrowed money 36% from family or friends 25% via loans, credit cards or overdrafts Many have increased their work hours during term, which has raised concerns around academic performance and mental health Graddinghomes.com said its services include verified listings, budgeting tools and tenant rights information to help students navigate the UK housing market. International student numbers rising despite cost pressure In the 2023–24 academic year, more than 600,000 international students were enrolled in UK universities. That number is expected to rise, putting further pressure on housing. But supply has not kept up. The UK has around 678,000 PBSA beds, while demand is estimated at 1.4 million. A fall in landlord participation due to mortgage costs has also reduced the number of shared rental houses. Why Indian students still choose the UK Despite rising costs, Indian students continue to choose the UK for its prestigious institutions. Imperial College London ranks 2nd in the QS World University Rankings 2025, followed by the University of Oxford at 3rd and the University of Cambridge at 5th. University College London comes in at 9th. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, Indian student enrolment rose by 39% in 2022–23 to reach 173,190—surpassing Chinese student numbers for the first time since 2018. Between April and June 2023, more than 16,185 student visas were issued to Indian nationals. The UK is targeting 600,000 international students by 2030, according to ICEF Monitor. Inflation and interest rates still high The Office for National Statistics reported that inflation in the UK was 3.5% in the 12 months to April, driven by rising household energy and water bills. The Bank of England expects inflation to tick up again later this year. Interest rates have been cut four times since August 2024, now standing at 4.25%.

    "text": "Time capsules turn up in the most unexpected places online. This one surfaced by design. It’s a [YouTube](https://www.wired.com/tag/youtube/) video, dated September 25, 2010. In it, dozens of people packed on a dark dance floor hold their hands up in anticipation of a beat drop. When it does, more hands go in the air. Grainy and less than 60 seconds long, the video is a remnant of that time, three years after the first [iPhone](https://www.wired.com/tag/iphone/), when people were still learning of its capabilities and house music was entering its Coachella bro phase. The video, filename IMG 0107, has nine views.\nIMG 0107 landed on my screen by way of [IMG_0001](https://walzr.com/IMG_0001), a website created by San Francisco engineer Riley Walz that pulls all the videos uploaded to YouTube from the iPhone’s long-lost “Send to YouTube” feature. Because iPhone used to name video files “IMG_XXXX,” Walz says he was able to use YouTube’s API to pull all the videos with names in that format. He identified about 5 million. On his site, those videos cycle through in no particular order, like a playlist on shuffle, offering up what Walz calls “unedited, pure moments from random lives.” It’s the kind of single-serving site few people make these days, but also one that speaks to the current yearning for a bygone digital era.\n“It's almost like these videos are kind of extinct now,” Walz says when I call to ask him about his site. “They won't really be produced this way ever again. It’s like a time machine.”\nNostalgia for the lost internet runs rampant in certain corners. Bluesky, which has been gaining about [a million users per day](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/g-s1-34898/bluesky-traffic-surge-after-election) since Election Day in the US, is full of people looking to re-create the Twitter of circa 2009, before the platform was awash in slurs and trolls. As WIRED reported earlier this week, fans had to [scramble to save Sexypedia’s data](https://www.wired.com/story/how-fans-saved-sexypedia-from-being-erased-from-the-internet/) after Fandom erased the wiki, taking the internet’s repository of Tumblr Sexymen offline. Tumblr, meanwhile, is [always dying](https://www.wired.com/story/end-of-the-tumblr-era/). People who want to remember what the internet looked like a decade ago often rely on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, but even [the future of that database](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-memory-wayback-machine-lawsuits/) feels uncertain.\nRemembering the internet of yore remains, somewhat ironically, one of the web’s favorite pastimes. Folks still wax poetic about the Space Jam website. (Officially, it’s now a landing page for the LeBron James–fronted 2021 reboot, but the old site still lives at [spacejam.com/1996](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/).) Sites like BuzzFeed, which now itself feels old school, still often run listicles of [internet](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mychalthompson/people-sharing-internet-memories) [memories](https://www.buzzfeed.com/elizabeth_cotton/earliest-internet-memories-nostalgia). But Internet Archaeology, a site devoted to collecting old home pages, [is gone](http://www.internetarchaeology.org/). (WIRED has a [small collection](https://www.wired.com/2013/04/websites-stuck-in-time/) of its findings.)\nGoogling around for this story I was served an [AI Overview](https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overview-search-results-copied-my-original-work/) that informed me that “remembering the old internet” refers to “looking back at the early days of the World Wide Web.” Thanks. I also got an old Reddit feed, a WIRED story, and a [piece from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/03/remember-the-internet/618350/) about “digital rot”—the phenomenon of the disappearing web that online archivists want to save. The problem with archiving, though, remains that you can archive a static image of an AOL Instant Messenger screen, but you can’t archive the feeling of getting kicked off of chat because your mom picked up the phone. Same goes for the feeling of seeing that a celeb liked your tweet, something most people haven’t felt in a long time.\nPerhaps this is what Walz captured with IMG_0001, why looking at it feels like a gut punch. In [his Garbage Day newsletter](https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-internet-s-most-vocal-freaks), Ryan Broderick called the site “beautiful, haunting, funny, and sort of magical. Like staring into a security camera of the past.” Perhaps. Or maybe it’s more like staring into the YouTube of the past, when videos on the platform looked like the “[Me at the zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_at_the_zoo)” clip that launched it. Not like a series of ring-lit people in search of brand deals.\nWhen Walz posted his new project on X, the replies were immediate and positive, if conflicted. “This is the perfect intersection of the type of thing that makes the internet special and worthwhile,” graphic designer Jason Combs [wrote](https://x.com/jasonsbmoc/status/1858681737066230267), “but also if I think too hard about [it] I’m gonna have a depressive episode.”\nEven if it gets lost to time, the internet can always be remade. People like Walz, who also made “[Shotspotter, but for music](https://www.404media.co/hidden-bopspotter-microphone-is-constantly-surveilling-san-francisco-for-good-music/)” site BopSpotter, and [Neal Agarwal](https://www.businessinsider.com/neal-agarwal-saves-internet-making-web-fun-again-games-2023-10), creator of [Internet Artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/), seek to both preserve the web of yore and make it fun again.\nWalz says he didn’t really intend to make something that made people so nostalgic; he wasn’t even sure many people would find it. They did, and it struck a chord. “One of my friends yesterday texted me and was like, ‘I actually was having a really, really bad day, but I looked at the site and I was watching it for an hour and just felt really, really good at the end of it,’” Riley says. “I wouldn't have guessed that that would be at all a possibility.”\nMaybe looking to the past points the way to the internet’s future.\nLoose Threads:\nIf your Friendsgiving doesn’t include people dressed up as their sexual awakening who make a TikTok about it, are you even doing it right? [These friends definitely are](https://www.tiktok.com/@shaenabeth/video/7438137522078715182). Please stick around for the Jessica Rabbit costume.\nHave you heard about the Etsy witches? Read all about that [here](https://www.wired.com/story/viral-tiktok-etsy-witch-elon-musk/).\nAdam Driver did five-star theater for Amazon. In this very actorly reading of a banana slicer review, he actually utters the phrase “We've incorporated it into our lovemaking.” Five stars.",

[The scholarship](https://hornraiser.utexas.edu/project/9567?utm_source=scalefunder&utm_campaign=amb_share&utm_name=xyavgmd7pbd0ykbxb052m2l&utm_medium=plain) – which ranged from $500 to $1,000 and was awarded annually – was part of [the Monarch Program](https://twitter.com/UT_Monarch), an initiative designed to support undocumented students. The program as whole was also eliminated as of Jan. 1, [as first reported by the student’s newspaper The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2024/01/24/rooted-members-leave-to-pick-up-the-pieces-after-sb-17-shuts-down-partnering-program-monarch/). kAm“(96? x =62C?65 E92E E96J H6C6 E2 6?E65 DEF56?ED[ x H2D 7FC:@FD[” D2:5 {FA6[ 2?

    "text": "游客在农田里体验农耕乐趣。\n“妈妈，快来这边，这里还有一条大鱼！”早春三月的周末，微风轻拂，在平和县霞寨镇的稻蛙菜生态种养基地里，一群孩子正卷起裤腿，在波光粼粼的水田沟渠中欢快地追逐鱼群，稚嫩的欢笑声回荡在青山绿水间。这幅充满生机的画面，正是当地生态农业转型的生动写照。\n作为九龙江西溪重要支流的花山溪，其上游流域的霞寨镇曾是闻名遐迩的蜜柚之乡。然而长期单一化种植带来的化肥过量施用，不仅影响了农业收成，更让流域生态承压。\n2021年春天，一场“生态保卫战”在花山溪上游打响。站在转型十字路口的霞寨人，以刀刃向内的勇气启动“退柚还耕”工程：在花山溪沿岸1公里生态缓冲带内，634亩低效柚园被改造成生态农田，构建起“水稻—虎纹蛙—经济作物”三位一体的立体种养系统。\n“我们实现了从‘柚海’到‘绿洲’的蜕变。”霞寨镇镇长庄坤明介绍，改造后的基地通过稻蛙共生体系，让水稻以蛙类排泄物为养分，蛙类则化身“田间卫士”捕食害虫，构建起闭环生态链。配套建设的蔬菜大棚和有机肥生产车间，更将废弃的稻草、秸秆乃至蜜柚残果转化为生物肥料，形成“资源—产品—再生资源”的循环经济模式。\n在基地负责人朱振伟的账本上，这方生态试验田正释放出可喜效益：每亩水田年产优质稻米270公斤，亩均收益2200元；虎纹蛙养殖亩产超2000斤；反季节蔬菜种植每亩可增加近0.8万元收益。与传统蜜柚种植相比，综合收益提升了不少。\n更令人欣喜的是生态效益的显现。经专业检测，基地化肥减量明显。花山溪流域水质持续好转，消失多年的白鹭群重现田间，形成“稻花香里说丰年，听取蛙声一片”的生态景观。\n如今，这片生态沃土正焕发农文旅新活力。农事体验区里，游客挽袖插秧、赤足摸鱼；研学基地内，学生观察生物链运作，用“稻蛙米”烹制的咸饭飘香四溢。今年以来，基地已接待游客及研学团体逾8000人次。\n“我们正奋力书写‘绿水青山就是金山银山’的霞寨答卷。”站在白鹭纷飞的绿色田埂上，霞寨镇党委书记林永金望着远处嬉戏的孩童说，随着绿色种植工作的不断推进，这个生态农业示范样本正为乡村振兴注入源源不断的绿色动能。",
