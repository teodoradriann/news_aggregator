    "text": "ISLAMABAD: While expressing serious security concerns ahead of the February 8, 2024 general elections, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Thursday, said that his party will hold Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja responsible if any harm caused to JUI workers during electioneering.\nAddressing a press conference here, Maulana raising serious questions over the judiciary’s involvement in the election process said, “If the chief election commissioner has to issue the election schedule on the court orders, how we can say that the ECP is functioning independently. When we are expressing our concerns, some segments start bullying us that we are running away from the elections”.\nHe said that an atmosphere of “judicial martial law” has been created in the country, JUI has drawn attention towards the whole situation from poor law and order situation in two provinces and the weather conditions in some parts of the country which will result in lower turnout in the elections.\nHe said that his party after thoroughly reviewing the countrywide situation has decided to empower the district leadership to take decisions regarding seat adjustment with other political parties and groups.\nResponding to a question regarding seat adjustment with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the JUI chief said that talks are underway between the two parties on the subject.\nWhile lambasting the ECP and the Supreme Court of Pakistan, he said three judges summoned the CEC and directed him to file an appeal before the apex court for polls. “If the election schedule was to be issued on the court’s directions, then when will the election commission become independent,” Maulana wondered, terming the current\nsituation as a “judicial martial law.”\nIt is pertinent to mention here that following the Lahore High Court (LHC)’s verdict on the appointment of bureaucrats as returning officers, a ruling that led to uncertainty over the much-awaited February 8 general elections, the ECP had filed a petition in the apex court after detailed deliberations the court’s senior judges and government officials, following which the top court ordered that no hindrances should be put forth in the way of polls moving forward.\nMaulana further said if political actors’ nomination papers were being snatched, it was “not right”, but noted that nothing wrong was being done to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\n“It is not a good omen to snatch the nomination papers of any candidate. The people will not cast votes due to the unrest. The provinces are witnessing unrest,” he maintained. Rehman rued, “The country is again on the verge of default.”\nJUI-F Emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman said his party was still reeling from the Bajaur blast, which resulted in the deaths of more than 40 workers, and banners were put in cities warning people against participating in JUI-F’s rallies.\nThe elections will be staged on February 8, 2024, but several political actors have warned that there are security threats to the polls and given the recent rise in terrorism, they demanded that the law and order situation should be conducive.\n“Cautioning against security threats does not mean that we’re against elections. I have struggled for elections for more than three years; it is my right that my party is given a good security environment,” Maulana said.\nSpeaking about Afghanistan, Rehman stated, “The stability in Afghanistan is the need of the hour for Pakistan. We will restore the ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.” Underscor-ing the importance of following international laws, he said, “There is a dire need to end the differences between the neighbouring countries by using the international laws.”\nHe also expressed serious concerns over the ongoing Israeli onslaught on Gaza and the global community’s inaction, saying that the Hamas resistance has put Palestine at the center of attention globally. The JUI chief said that the founder of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah while rejecting the creation of Israel had declared it as an illegal entity. He added that some local and global forces in the recent past installed a government in Pakistan to accept Israel but JUI and other partners resisted the move and did not let\nthem succeed in their nefarious designs.\nMaulana Fazlur Rahman said that Pakistan’s DNA consists of not accepting the two-state solution of the Palestine issue, saying that Israel has committed countless war crimes in Gaza by killing innocent people and the global\ncommunity must take it seriously.\nIsrael has murdered thousands of Palestinian children as well as thousands of women and civilians. He said that Israeli authorities had imagined that the Palestinian freedom movement would be intimidated by the military might of Israel, but it did not work as Israel’s strength and arrogance have been destroyed by the resistance forces.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281031/fazl-says-concerned-at-security-situation\">Fazl says concerned at security situation\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

    "text": "A new tool is available to help surfers, swimmers and rock fishers alike stay safe in the ocean. The Nearshore Wave Tool, developed by NSW's Environment and Heritage scientists, is updated every hour, providing up-to-date information about coastal conditions. The tool uses seven years of data from nearshore 'smart' buoys to create a 10-day wave forecast, as well as provide recent wave information. \"The NearShore Wave Tool helps you plan a day at the beach that will be safe for the whole family,\" Minister for Climate Change and the Environment Penny Sharpe said. \"If you're a rock fisher it will help you pick a low-risk day or time. And if you're a boater it will also make a difference. \"Those who love their rock fishing know it's a dangerous sport, but the NearShore Wave Tool will provide clear data that allows them to plan properly and avoid days that are too dangerous.\" The tool also combines 70 years of historic wave data and seafloor mapping to provide past wave data, which will help with coastal planning and prevention. \"It will help councils and other organisations look back on the historical data showing the impact of big flood events and storms,\" Sharpe said. \"We are getting more of those and understanding what happened in the past will help us plan for the future.\" The tool is expected to be used to manage risks of coastal hazards, such as \"proactive beach closures\", the state government said. It will also help travellers plan coastal visits based on better surf conditions.",

    "title": "Winter has finally come to Winnipeg — and some are revelling in all the snow",
    "text": "When Brian Barton saw the thick blanket of snow covering his Westwood driveway Thursday morning, two words immediately sprang to mind.\n“Love it,” said the Winnipeg retiree and avid cross-country skier. “You can’t ski on grass.”\nThe dump of snow offers a chance for “getting out and getting exercise — that’s the way I look at it,” Barton said as he took a break from shovelling the light, fluffy snow that has carpeted Winnipeg and parts of southern Manitoba since it started falling Wednesday night.\n“I’ve been known to be out here about four times in a day. I just don’t want the snow to get packed, because then it becomes hard shovelling.”\nScott Kehler, president and chief scientist at Weatherlogics, said close to 15 centimetres had fallen in Winnipeg by 6 a.m. Thursday and the city will receive another five centimetres when all is said and done.\nMichael Cantor, Winnipeg’s manager of streets maintenance, said over 100 crews were already out clearing the highest-prioritized busy streets and sidewalks during the day on Thursday.\nBut the major clearing won’t start until around 7 p.m., when closer to 300 pieces of equipment will be out on the roads.\nThat includes 15 extra machines the city added to its fleet this year, which Cantor said he hopes can help crews meet their level of service targets for snow clearing.\nSnow was blowing overtop of Highway 1 on Thursday as it fell over southern Manitoba. (Justin Fraser/CBC)\nHe said the city will decide by Friday morning whether residential streets also need to be cleared, though that process wouldn’t start until the major priority streets are finished.\nIn the meantime, Cantor asked drivers to make sure they slow down, drive to conditions and stay safe around snow-clearing equipment. Downloading the city’s Know Your Zone app can also help people get the information they need about snow zones, he said.\nSkiers, snowmobilers rejoice The snowfall was a welcome sight for Laurie Penton, manager of the Windsor Park Nordic Centre, whose phone has been ringing all morning as staff work to get its cross-country ski trails groomed.\nPenton said they expect to be ready for the public on Friday — which likely marks the latest in the season the centre has opened, he said.\nWhile packing down the airy snow Winnipeg is getting right now is “a bit of a process,” he said he would take “every flake we can get” after a winter that so far has seen little snow.\nManager Laurie Penton says the Windsor Park Nordic Centre is expected to be open Friday now that there’s so much snow on the ground. (Josh Crabb/CBC)\n“Everyone will just be happy,” Penton said. “Fresh air always lifts everybody’s spirits, and this is such a great way to get some fresh air.”\nSnowmobilers are also looking excited to see the fresh snow finally falling across southern Manitoba, said Yvonne Rideout, executive director of Snoman, a non-profit that represents dozens of snowmobiling clubs.\nAs of Thursday morning, 27 of those clubs were out either moving snow, grooming trails or preparing to help out on Friday.\n“I think we’re doing good, as long as we can hold on to the snow we have,” Rideout said.\n“And I think with the temperatures, that will certainly be possible.”\nBack in his Westwood driveway, Barton has a message for anyone not excited about the snow finally hiting a city known for its long, frigid winters.\n“I look at it as part of living in Winnipeg. If you don’t like the snow, well — I say move to some place where there is none,” he said.\n“You know it’s going to come. You just hope it’s not going to come in April and in May and then flood.”",

    "text": "Este jueves, el Congreso aprobó la moción de interpelación contra Rául Perez Reyes, ministro de Transportes y Comunicaciones, tras el incidente que ocurrió en el el Aeropuerto Jorge Chávez en la pista de aterrizaje, el domingo de 2 junio. Dicho documento fue presentado por Rosselli Amuruz, tercera vicepresidenta del Congreso del Perú y luego de su admisión, el titlar del MTC deberá acudir al Pleno del Congreso este 12 de junio para responder las interrogantes. Esta segunda moción de interpelación, lleva la firma de 20 parlamentarios y consta de 12 preguntas sobre los hechos ocurridos en el Aeropuerto Jorge Chávez, donde se paralizó el servicio eléctrico en la pista de aterrizaje, generando un retraso en los vuelos de decenas de pasajeros. Como se recuerda, anteriormente se había presentado una moción de interpelación contra el ministro de Transportes, en torno a la falta de mantenimiento de carreteras de Ayacucho. Ministro de Transportes califica de “evento fortuito” la falla de luces en el Aeropuerto Jorge Chávez Desde ayer, en horas de la tarde, se vive un caos en el Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez, a causa de una falla en el sistema de luces de la pista de aterrizaje. Esto ha causado la cancelación de los vuelos y cientos de pasajeros se han visto afectados, teniendo que pasar la noche en el mismo aeropuerto. Una situación similar en los aeropuertos de Quito (Ecuador) o Santiago de Chile, así como en aeropuertos regionales de Perú. Sobre esta situación, el ministro de Transportes y Comunicaciones (MTC), Raúl Pérez-Reyes, que se encuentra en el Aeropuerto Jorge Chávez, informó que está supervisando la situación y anunció junto al presidente de Corpac que se reanudaron los vuelos y que en las próximas horas se anunciará la reprogramación de los viajes. “Es un evento fortuito, ya lo resolvió Corpac con su equipo técnico. Habría sanción si hubiera un encubrimiento, que en este caso no la hay. Estamos hablando de un problema técnico, estamos hablando de un cable que está enterrado y lo que se hace es un mantenimiento electrónico que une a ese cableado. Entonces, lo que se hace permanentemente Corpac es eso”, dijo el titular del MTC.

The county, as a designated “cooperating agency,” has until June 20 to submit official comments, which the U.S. Forest Service has said carry more weight than those from the general public.
