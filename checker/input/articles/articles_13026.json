    "text": "María José Suárez ha sido, a su pesar, uno de los personajes de este verano 2024 después de que saliese a la luz que su pareja durante varios años, el jinete Álvaro Muñoz Escassi, le había sido infiel. La modelo y exmiss España ha pasado, sin duda, algunas de las semanas más complicadas de su vida, sobre todo al permanecer expuesta bajo el foco mediático, pero ha sacado fuerza de flaqueza y ha conseguido aguantar el tipo y seguir adelante con sus quehaceres. Ahora, María José Suárez ha dejado España y ha hecho balance de estos intensos últimos meses. La sevillana admite que este verano ha mantenido \\\"charlas interminables\\\" con sus \\\"hermanas y cuñados\\\", conversaciones en las que \\\"por muy dramático que sea el tema\\\", siempre le hacen bien. Y lo consiguen porque con ellos, afirma, \\\"siempre acabamos riéndonos\\\". Y después del verano que ha tenido la modelo, eso es algo que se obliga a recordarse y, por supuesto, a poner en el lado positivo de la balanza. Y es que la exmiss España ha decidido hacer balance de lo que han sido estas últimas y agitadas semanas tras su ruptura con Álvaro Muñoz Escassi. Reconoce que se trata de algo que le ha pasado factura, pero prefiere repasar todo lo que le ha ocurrido en estos últimos meses y percatarse de que la vida no es tan mala como podría parecer a primera vista. María José Suárez hace estas reflexiones muy lejos de España, concretamente en Miami (Estados Unidos), donde vivió hace tiempo y donde ha decidido escaparse durante unos días antes de volver a la rutina. Allí, mirando un precioso amanecer, ha optado por hacer balance de estas últimas semanas para recordarse cuántas cosas buenas ha disfrutado, como un viaje a Ibiza con amigas, \\\"conocer gente nueva en Mallorca\\\", reencontrase \\\"con viejas amigas en Málaga\\\", estar con su hijo y sus sobrinos \\\"en las playas de Cádiz\\\", \\\"terminar la reforma de mi casa\\\", \\\"salir a cenar con un amigo al que hace años que no veía\\\", \\\"hacer más deporte que nunca\\\", \\\"escuchar música a todo lo que da el coche\\\", preparar proyectos para septiembre y \\\"un viaje sorpresa a Miami\\\". El balance es, desde luego, más que positivo, aunque María José Suárez admite que \\\"todo lo malo que ha venido este verano con fuerza a atropellarme y desestabilizarme\\\" está ahí, pero \\\"ya en la papelera\\\". Así que opta por quedarse \\\"con lo bueno, que ha sido mucho\\\" y prefiere instalarse \\\"en el presente, en la bandeja de entrada\\\", porque \\\"la vida a veces duele, pero el resto del tiempo es maravillosa\\\", sentencia llena de energía y optimismo la exmiss España.",

    "text": "(CNN) — It looks like Mother Nature has her seasons mixed up as a potent, far-reaching storm gears up to unload snow, ice and severe thunderstorms on the central US this weekend. In a seasonal role-reversal, back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow [as they had all winter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/08/weather/winter-warmth-record-climate/index.html). By Friday morning, the first storm was underway, and already dropped a few inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes. At least 3 inches of snow covered parts of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro from Thursday night into Friday morning. Snow will persist through Friday evening over the Great Lakes before the quick-moving storm slides into the Northeast on Saturday. The second storm will arrive in the central US on Sunday. This encore is expected to outperform its predecessor, ushering in widespread, troublesome and longer-lasting impacts. “Disruptions to daily life” are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday. Snow is likely to spread from the northern Rockies to the Midwest on Sunday as the storm moves from the Rockies into the Plains and strengthens. Winds will become quite gusty as the storm grows. Blowing snow could create very poor visibility, affecting travel on the ground and in the air. Widespread snowfall totals of over half a foot are likely in multiple north-central states. Over a foot of snow is possible where the heaviest snow centers. This far in advance, it’s difficult to say exactly where these highest totals will occur, but the Dakotas and Minnesota could end up in the bull’s-eye. Snow will continue to bury the northern US as the storm pushes east on Monday. Minneapolis received less than a foot of snow from December through February – 2 feet short of what a typical winter brings. But what it got over the course of three months may be matched – or exceeded – in a matter of days. A similar scenario could play out in Fargo, North Dakota, and Aberdeen, South Dakota. Sleet and freezing rain will further complicate the snowfall forecast and travel concerns Sunday and Monday. In Iowa, precipitation could start out as snow on Sunday before mixing with sleet and turning over to rain on Monday. The opposite could occur in Nebraska, where Sunday rain could morph into an icy mix and eventually snow on Monday. Ice buildup could make travel treacherous or weigh down power lines to their breaking point. Damaging thunderstorms will rumble to life Unlike the first quick-hitting storm, the storm arriving early next week will create hazards beyond snow. Cold air trailing behind the wide-reaching storm’s cold front will clash with warm, moist air in place over the South and produce severe thunderstorms Sunday and Monday. The risk on Sunday will affect areas from Texas through Kansas. Damaging thunderstorms are expected to fire up late Sunday afternoon from central Texas to central Kansas and track slowly eastward through the evening. Wind gusts in excess of 60 mph, hail bigger than quarters and a few tornadoes are possible. The bull’s-eye of severe thunderstorm risk will shift east on Monday and capture parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Hazardous thunderstorm activity could get underway by Monday afternoon from Texas to Arkansas and expand in scope as storms track east through the evening hours. Severe hazards are once again possible Monday. Thunderstorms will rumble across the South on Tuesday, but the threat for widespread damaging storms appears to be limited.

    "text": "Tutto confermato: la settimana santa sarà estrema a causa del passaggio sull'Italia di un insidioso vortice ciclonico, da noi simpaticamente chiamato \"Ciclone della Colomba\", visto il periodo dell'anno in cui arriverà. Avremo a che fare con precipitazioni abbondanti, nevose in montagna e con venti molto forti lungo le coste. Saranno tante le regioni ad essere interessate dal maltempo. Ma andiamo con ordine. La settimana che ci porterà alla Pasqua inizierà Lunedì 25 Marzo nel segno della stabilità atmosferica, grazie ad una temporanea rimonta dell'anticiclone africano che garantirà un discreto soleggiamento su buona parte del Paese. Si tratterà tuttavia solo di un fuoco di paglia: l'avvicinamento di una poderosa depressione, sospinta da masse d'aria di origine polare, provocherà infatti un drastico cambiamento del tempo a livello continentale, a partire da Martedì 26 Marzo con le prime precipitazioni al Centro-Nord. Attenzione perché le correnti fredde in ingresso dalla Porta del Rodano, favoriranno la formazione di un Ciclone Mediterraneo che dal Golfo del Leone (Francia) si sposterà rapidamente verso i nostri mari. Appunto, il Ciclone della Colomba. Tra Mercoledì 27 e Giovedì 28 Marzo entreremo nella fase clou di questa ondata di maltempo pre-pasquale: questo tipo di configurazione favorisce lo scontro tra masse d'aria di origine diversa (aria fredda di origine polare e aria calda in risalita dall'Africa) aumentando di conseguenza il rischio di eventi meteo estremi come nubifragi e pericolose grandinate. Sulle Alpi tornerà anche la neve, con fiocchi a partire dai 1400/1500 metri di quota (piuttosto in basso per essere fine Marzo). Al momento, le zone maggiormente a rischio, come confermano gli ultimi aggiornamenti, paiono essere le regioni del Centro-Nord (Mercoledì), quelle del versante meridionale tirrenico e le due Isole Maggiori (Giovedì). Di questo, tuttavia, avremo modo di riparlare nel corso dei nostri prossimi aggiornamenti.",

    "text": "Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh) [India], July 24 (ANI): A Large number of devotees took a holy dip in the confluence of Rivers Ganga and Yamuna, known as 'Sangam' in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj on Thursday on the occasion of Shravan Amavasya.\nTaking a dip in the holy water on Shravan Amavasya is considered to have special significance, and devotees today, along with chanting and penance, also make donations.\nAlso Read | PM Modi UK Visit: Indian Diaspora in London Meets PM Narendra Modi, Calls It ‘Surreal’ and ‘Emotional’ (Watch Videos).\nEven after the flood, a flock of devotees has been reaching at the Sangam point since this morning.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the weather in Prayagraj would be \"Generally cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers\".\nAlso Read | Parliament Monsoon Session 2025: Lok Sabha to Hold 16-Hour-Long Discussion on Operation Sindoor From July 28; PM Narendra Modi to Participate in Debate, Say Sources.\nIt also said that the maximum temperature would be 35 degrees and the minimum would be 27 degrees. Humidity is 90 degrees maximum and 70 degrees minimum, as per IMD.\nAcross various states in India, the auspicious day of Shravan Amavasya is being celebrated. At the Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, priests performed Bhasma Aarti, and devotees prayed with their hands folded.\nMoreover, people are also performing prayers to their ancestors and taking a holy dip in the sea at the Thoothukudi Port beach in Tamil Nadu. The devotees are praying for the peace of the departed ancestors and seeking their blessings.\nThis particular Amavasya, observed on July 24, 2025, is also known as \"Hariyali Amavasya\".\nAccording to the Hindu tradition, Amavasya is considered a time for ancestral remembrance, and when it falls in Shravan, it carries added power and sanctity.\nOn this auspicious day, families perform Tarpan, Shraddha, and other rituals to pay homage to their ancestors, seeking their blessings for peace and wellbeing.\nPeople also observe the day by bathing in holy rivers, such as the Ganga, and offering their prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. They also do fasting, donate to the needy, and participate in community rituals and temple visits.\nThe name \"Hariyali Amavasya\" reflects the lush renewal of life during the monsoon season. It's a symbolic time of fertility, growth, and preparation for the future.\nYesterday, the sacred festival of Sawan Shivratri was celebrated with immense devotion across the country, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, as thousands of devotees and Kanwar pilgrims gathered at prominent Shiva temples to offer prayers and perform rituals.\nIn Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, special prayers were conducted at the Shiv Temple of the Kailash Math. The city also witnessed massive footfall at the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Jyotirlinga Temple, one of the most revered Jyotirlingas in India. Long queues of saffron-clad Kanwar pilgrims, many of whom had walked barefoot for days, lined the streets, waiting patiently to catch a glimpse of the deity. They offered their prayers on this spiritually significant day.\nIn Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat, devotees flocked to the Shree Parshuram Pura Mahadev Mandir to offer their prayers. Devotees thronged the ancient premises from early morning, pouring holy water and milk over the Shivalinga, a ritual symbolic of purification and surrender to Lord Shiva.\nSawan Shivratri, observed during the holy month of Sawan, is considered one of the most auspicious days for worshipping Lord Shiva. Devotees observe fasts, visit temples, and chant Shiva mantras, believing that this day holds the power to absolve sins and fulfil heartfelt desires.\nThis year, Sawan began on July 11 and will conclude on August 9. It is the fifth month of the Hindu lunar calendar and is considered one of the holiest periods for devotees of Shiva.

    "title": "Paris Hilton Says She Is \"New To Parenting\" After Parenting Police Schooled Her | Times Now",
    "text": "Paris Hilton found herself under scrutiny once again after the “parenting police” criticised her for not putting a life jacket on her son, Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum, during a recent outing at sea. The 43-year-old reality star had shared a TikTok video featuring her 1-year-old son exploring a luxury Sunreef catamaran during a vacation in France last month. What Is In The Video? In the video, Phoenix is seen happily wandering around the catamaran in a burgundy shirt and matching shorts as the boat cruised over the water. He walked across the deck, crawled on the mesh netting above the water, and even called out \\\"Mama\\\" as he climbed down a few steps. While the video captured a joyful moment, several followers expressed concern about the toddler’s safety, as he was not wearing a life jacket during the excursion. One concerned fan commented, \\\"Momma, please have him wear a life jacket always on a boat!! Stuff happens. That’s why they’re called accidents. With love.\\\" Another added, \\\"My anxiety not seeing him in a life jacket! Can never be too safe on the water!\\\" A string of similar comments flooded the post, with followers urging Hilton to prioritize her son's safety. What Was Paris Hilton's Response? On Thursday, Hilton responded to the criticism by explaining that both she and her husband, Carter Reum, had been closely monitoring Phoenix throughout the outing. \\\"Hey Mamma’s, thank you for the advice & always caring about my #CutesieCrew. It’s a big boat & my husband and I are following him around everywhere & watching like hawks. My babies are my world!\\\" she wrote in the comments section. Also Read: Here Are Five Things You Can Learn From Sourav Ganguly's Parenting Style Previous Incidents This isn't the first time Hilton has faced backlash over her parenting decisions. Earlier in May, Hilton shared a TikTok video of herself playing with Phoenix in the water, but followers quickly pointed out that the safety vest her son was wearing was incorrectly fastened backward. Hilton responded with humour, acknowledging the mistake and reassuring fans that she had the situation under control. \\\"Oops! Thank you! I never let him out of my arms. Thought it was backward too, I said that to the person whom I bought it from & they said it was on right,\\\" she replied. Hilton has also been criticised for improperly harnessing her children in car seats. After receiving feedback from her followers, the socialite posted an update, showing that she had corrected the issue and expressed gratitude for the advice. \\\"Thanks for the mom advice, I'm new to this,\\\" Hilton wrote. Paris Hilton and Carter Reum, who married in November 2021, welcomed their son Phoenix via surrogate in February 2023 and recently revealed they also welcomed a daughter, London, with the help of a surrogate. Hilton, who has been eagerly embracing motherhood, had previously shared her excitement about starting a family and balancing her career and personal life.
