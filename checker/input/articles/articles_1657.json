    "text": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces By Press Association December 29 2023, 12.10am Share Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces Share via Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Messenger Linkedin Email Post link https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/news/uk/6310613/sharp-rise-in-religious-hate-crimes-recorded-by-uks-largest-police-forces/ Copy Link The Home Office condemned the rise, saying there was ‘no place for hate in our society’ (PA)\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "Labour has dropped legal action against five ex-staff members accused of leaking an internal report to undermine Sir Keir Starmer&#039;s leadership. The long-running legal case has cost £1.5million and could have been £900,000 more. The five, who denied it, included Jeremy Corbyn&#039;s communications director Seumas Milne and the ex-leader&#039;s chief-of-staff Karie Murphy. The three others were Georgie Robertson, Laura Murray and Harry Hayball . The report into strife under Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership of the party was leaked when Sir Keir became its new leader in April 2020. The 860-page document, that included hundreds of Whatsapp messages, found &#039;no evidence&#039; of anti-Semitism being handled differently to other complaints. Labour has dropped legal action against five ex-staff members accused of leaking an internal report to undermine Sir Keir Starmer&#039;s leadership The five, who denied it, included Jeremy Corbyn&#039;s communications director Seumas Milne and the ex-leader&#039;s chief-of-staff Karie Murphy (pictured) The report into strife under Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership of the party was leaked when Sir Keir became its new leader in April 2020. Pictured: Seumas Milne It also alleged that those who were opposed to Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership worked against him and damaged the party&#039;s success in the 2017 election. The five affected previously said they would &#039;vigorously defend themselves&#039; in a High Court action and described the claims as &#039;baseless&#039;. An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office was also not able to dtermine the source of the leak. A joint statement issued on June 6 by Labour and law firm Carter Ruck read: &#039;The Party is discontinuing its legal claims against Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Georgie Robertson, Harry Hayball and Laura Murray on a &#039;no order as to costs&#039; basis. &#039;The five welcome the resolution of the claims.&#039; Last year, Labour asked the High Court to delay a full hearing of the case until February next year at the earliest.",

La multimedallista olímpica afirmó que cometió “un error de juicio” en el suceso filmado hace cuatro años, que reveló inicialmente la página web neerlandesa horses.nl .\n“Estoy profundamente avergonzada y debería haber dado un mejor ejemplo” “Es comprensible que la Federación Internacional de Deportes Ecuestres (FEI) investigue, y he tomado la decisión de retirarme de todas las competiciones -incluidos los Juegos Olímpicos de París- mientras se lleva a cabo este proceso”, dijo Dujardin.\n“Lo que pasó estuvo completamente fuera de lugar y no refleja cómo entreno a mis caballos o a mis alumnos. Sin embargo, no hay excusa. Estoy profundamente avergonzada y debería haber dado un mejor ejemplo ”, afirmó.\nDe acuerdo con la agencia británica PA , la denuncia ante la Federación Internacional de Deportes Ecuestres (FEI) y la Federación Ecuestre Británica (FEB) provino de un abogado neerlandés en representación de un cliente.",

    "text": "Ukrainian Catholic church says Vatican document on blessing same sex couples does not apply Story highlights Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the Vatican document \"interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church\" but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the Vatican document \"interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church\" but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church. The head of Ukraine's eastern-rite Catholic church on Saturday said a document endorsed by Pope Francis this week permitting blessings for same-sex couples did not apply to his church and its teachings. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the Vatican document \"interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church\" but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church. ALSO READ | [Pope faces criticism for telling Russian youths to remember 'legacy' of a 'great empire'](https://www.wionews.com/world/pope-faces-criticism-for-telling-russian-youths-to-remember-legacy-of-a-great-empire-630204) trending now \"Thus...this Declaration applies solely to the Latin Church and has no legal force for the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,\" Shevchuk said in a statement. He said a blessing could not be separated from the church's teachings and \"can in no way contradict the teaching of the Catholic Church about the family as a faithful, indissoluble, and fertile union of love between a man and a woman.\" The eastern-rite church worships according to rites similar to the Orthodox faith, but is in communion with Rome by virtue of a 16th century agreement. Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10 per cent of the population of Ukraine. The document from the Vatican's doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies. It said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage. Gay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump was mocked online for comments he made during a meandering press conference, claiming that “substantially more” than 100 percent of job creation went to migrants, a mathematical impossibility.\nTrump spoke from his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey Thursday afternoon — a follow-up to last week’s similar event at Mar-a-Lago that drew harsh fact-checks finding triple-digit quantities of lies, misrepresentations, and distortions.\nVice President Kamala Harris’s campaign mocked Trump in advance of the presser, and social media users joined in as Trump’s remarks rolled on.\nOne comment that especially drew attention was his comment attacking President Joe Biden — and Harris as part of the administration — on the economy, attempting to downplay positive news about job creation.\n“Virtually 100% of the net job creation in the last year has gotten to migrants,” said Trump, “You know that? Most of the job creation has gone to migrants. In fact, I’ve heard that substantially more than — uh, beyond, actually beyond the number of 100%, it’s a much higher number than that, but the government hasn’t caught up with that yet, but virtually right now as of the time they did this virtually 100% of the net job creation in the last year has gone to migrants.”\nHe went on with a rant about Social Security, saying it would “blow up and fail,” “will be a blow up like you’ve never seen before,” if Harris is elected.\nBesides the fact that is objectively not accurate that “virtually 100%” of jobs went to migrants, it is not mathematically possible for more than 100% of the total jobs created to go to any category of people. Jobs can increase at a rate higher than 100% — anything that doubles in number, for example, is increasing by 200% — but the amount of new jobs is a finite number and more than actually exist cannot be taken by either migrants or Americans or anyone.\n(On a related note, this is why motivational posters and sports team coaches urging you to “give 110%!” are full of crap and bad at math.)\nPeople on The Platform Formerly Known as Twitter seemed to have a better grasp on basic mathematics than the forty-fifth president, and delivered the expected mocking. Below, a few examples.\nOMG. OMG.\nBesides that this is INSANELY DELUSIONAL, maybe having 2nd grade level math knowledge could help him out? https://t.co/5JmpGJiQNv\n— Spiro’s Ghost (@AntiToxicPeople) August 15, 2024\nThere are lies and there’s pure insanity.\nLie: 100% of new jobs have gone to migrants.\nPure insanity: The number is actually higher than 100%.\nSay what? https://t.co/8YRXvO8NvG\n— Bryan Behar (@bryanbehar) August 15, 2024\nPercentages: How Do They Work?\n— Rachel Vindman 🇺🇸🦅🌻 (@natsechobbyist) August 15, 2024\nBy next week , he will be claiming that 150% is actually 100% and all mathematicians went wrong.\n— zorluhan (@zorluhanzorlu) August 15, 2024\nHe’s literally reading a piece of paper written for him and somehow he still finds a way to say something totally crazy and stupid like this. Absolutely unreal how someone let this stat be put on a piece of paper.\n— Isiah Sanders (@MrZaySanders) August 15, 2024\nUm. There is nothing higher than 100 percent\n— Rose Benson (@NotoriousRBF) August 15, 2024\n“More than 100%?” No wonder this guy & Project 2025 want to destroy public education. https://t.co/gP2dEsQ5nA\n— Harris | Walz War Room (Text JOIN to 30330) (@HarrisWarRoom) August 15, 2024\nDear @JaredEMoskowitz\nA guy who knows a guy who knows a guy heard from his sister’s brother’s girlfriend’s cousin that migrants have taken 500% of all new jobs.\nI request a congressional inquiry. https://t.co/NYRfJY9tpN\n— Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) August 15, 2024\nClaiming that \"over 100%\" of job creation has gone to migrants is next-level ridiculous.\nTrump has shown he doesn't understand:\n-wind turbines\n-magnets\n-hurricanes\n-boats\n-batteries\n-energy storage\n-and now percentages\n— Jared Ryan Sears (@JaredRyanSears) August 15, 2024\n2+2 = 5\nSeriously this is the sign of somebody who is not right mentally\nI do think it’s a legitimate question why the press covered Biden‘s actually less severe symptoms so intensively & gives Trump differential treatment https://t.co/WjHS481VZ0\n— Norm Eisen (#TryingTrump out now!)
