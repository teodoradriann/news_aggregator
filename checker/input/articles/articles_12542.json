    "title": "Woman thought she 'was going to die' after gastric balloon got stuck in her intestines",
    "text": "A woman who paid £4,500 for a gastric balloon ended up in intensive care after it got stuck in her intestines. Alaina Shaw, 33, hoped the procedure would kick-start her weight-loss journey.\nIt involves swallowing a capsule which then inflates in the stomach and reduces appetite before usually passing naturally through the gastrointestinal tract without the need for a removal procedure. But the former accountant said it felt like she was going to die after the balloon ended up stuck inside her after it moved from her stomach to her intestine.\nAlaina, from Uxbridge, West London, who weighs 21 stone, said: “I didn’t lose any weight - I thought I was going to die. I want to warn people about the dangers of getting this done.”\nIn October 2023, Alaina had a consultation at a clinic in north London. She said she went ahead with the surgery as she was desperate to start losing weight.\nAlaina paid £4,500 to have the procedure done in November 2023 and said she was told she could lose up to 20% of her body weight within four months. But, instead of shedding pounds, she found herself in a life-threatening situation.\n\"It was supposed to be a temporary thing - you swallow this pill, they fill it with saline solution, and they check on an X-ray if it’s there,\" she said. But after the operation, Alaina woke up in immediate pain.\n\"I was in a lot of pain – it felt like a foreign body, but I was assured that I would start feeling better,\" she said. However, as the weeks went by, Alaina found that she was losing no weight and her appetite was exactly the same.\nShe decided to contact the practice, but claims they were “palming her off”. \"They didn’t seem like they were trying to help me,\" Alaina said. \"I said it was becoming a joke – I wasn’t losing any weight - I hadn’t even lost a stone.\"\nAlaina demanded an appointment with the clinic, but claims she was told it would be ill-advised to give a “young healthy woman” an X-ray. Alaina said: “I told them I’m not healthy and I’m not that young!”\nAlaina eventually managed to get an appointment, she said, but before she could attend, she woke up in agonising pain. Her brother rushed her to Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, where she says she was “literally wailing in pain”.\nAt the hospital, doctors performed keyhole surgery and found the balloon, instead of dissolving as it was supposed to, had lodged itself in her intestines, she claims. She said she was warned surgeons might have to remove part of Alaina’s bowel to remove the balloon.\nThankfully, in the end they were able to remove it without resorting to such drastic measures, but Alaina still had to be kept in an ICU unit and the operation left her with a five-inch incision on her belly button to get the balloon out.\nAlaina said: \"I lost no weight and ended up in hospital questioning if I was going to survive. I was in ICU for two days - I was scared I was going to die.”\nAfter her stint in ICU she was released from hospital after two weeks, but was left in limbo as she had only just quit her job as an account manager to start her own dog-walking business.\n“It was the worst possible timing as I was unable to work for eight weeks – it really hit me financially,\" she said. Alaina is trying to get full reimbursement from the clinic.\nAlaina said: \"They were going to offer me £1,000 back - I didn’t lose any weight and could have died.\"\nShe claims the manufacturers want the balloon back in order to investigate. “It’s been inside me and they want it back – it’s rank,” Alaina said.\nThe makers of the balloon said: \"We are unable to comment on specific patient cases.\" A spokesperson added \"safety and effectiveness\" of the balloon was \"well-established\" and said: \"We are committed to working with clinics to ensure that any issues are thoroughly investigated and resolved in line with our commitment to patient safety.\"\nThe clinic did not respond to a request for comment. According to the NHS, in general the surgery is a very safe procedure, though, as a relatively new procedure the long-term effects are as yet unknown.\nComplications are rare, but can include leakage or bursting of the balloon, ulcers, a rupture or bleeding in the stomach or windpipe caused by a faulty insertion of the balloon or gastric problems such as reflux, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.",

    "title": "国补叠加旧车回收多重优惠 \"小电驴\"市场掀起换新热潮_财报网",
    "text": "“顾客不仅能享受国补，还能根据旧车的具体情况进行相应抵扣，厂家有时还会对特定车型给予额外优惠。”近日，在北京市东城区一家电动自行车专卖店内，有不少消费者前来选车。该门店负责人周女士告诉记者，自从今年电动自行车以旧换新活动启动后，迎来一波换购新车热潮，门店销量比去年同期增长约30%。\n根据商务部等5部门联合印发的《关于做好2025年度电动自行车以旧换新工作的通知》(以下简称《通知》)，自今年1月1日起延续开展电动自行车以旧换新工作。“往年2月都是销售淡季，但今年我们的销量很不错，现在天气逐渐暖和了，接下来要更忙了。”周女士说。\n国补叠加旧车回收多重优惠\n“我这辆旧电动自行车骑了5年，看到今年以旧换新活动又上新了，正好置换一辆。”在上述门店提车的王女士给记者算了一笔账：目标新车的标价是3500元，可以申领500元国补，旧车抵扣400元，最后实际提车只花了2600元，“省了900元”。\n为鼓励电动自行车以旧换新，《通知》提出，对个人消费者交售报废老旧电动自行车并换购合格新车的，给予以旧换新补贴。\n“我们主要根据电动自行车的车身完好程度、使用年份、电池容量等来确定回收金额，普遍在100元至500元不等，有部分车型的回收价格甚至高达1000元。”周女士介绍说。\n截至目前，已有多个省份出台实施细则，各地在具体的补贴标准上有所不同。例如，北京市2025年电动自行车以旧换新补贴标准为每辆新购车辆补贴500元。\n带动非标旧车加速淘汰\n来源权属明确且配备车载电池的报废老旧电动自行车可参加以旧换新(含无牌);交售的老旧电动自行车必须交由具备相关资质的回收企业报废处置，并完善交接手续;推动增加回收企业数量，合理提高交售旧车的价格，激励消费者选择正规渠道交售报废旧车……电动自行车收旧环节的诸多优化举措，吸引了不少消费者逐步淘汰旧车，推动电动自行车领域向安全规范的方向“提速前行”。\n日前，电动自行车强制性国家标准修订后正式对外发布，新国标将替代2018年版本标准，于今年9月1日实施。同时，工信部明确，消费者已经购买的不符合新标准的车辆不会被强制淘汰，可借助以旧换新等政策加速更新换代。\n对此，广州市电动自行车行业协会秘书长巫立东分析认为，今年电动自行车以旧换新政策通过扩大收旧范围、强制报废拆解等举措，在扩大参与受众的同时兼顾了安全规范，对淘汰不符合新国标的非规范电动自行车具有显著推动作用。\n推动行业提质升级\n“消费者对于更智能、续航里程更长、安全系数更高的电动自行车换购需求旺盛。”周女士说，以旧换新让顾客有了更大的选择空间，在同样的预算下，顾客可以购买到性能更好、配置更全的电动自行车。\n巫立东认为，以旧换新可以加速淘汰落后产能，倒逼生产企业转型生产符合新国标的车型，促进智能控制系统等核心部件的升级，推动产业链向高质量方向发展。\n据悉，2024年全国电动自行车以旧换新超过138万辆，发放补贴资金6亿多元，带动销售37.4亿元。“今年延续去年的以旧换新工作，通过经济激励、扩大覆盖范围、强制报废的组合拳，将加速淘汰存量非标电动车，同时推动行业向安全化、智能化、标准化、绿色化转型。”巫立东表示。(记者 赵欢)\n标签：",

Desde Ecuador, también puede ser observado 'el cometa del siglo'. La Luna llena vista desde el noroccidente de Quito, Ecuador, el 19 de agosto de 2024. - Foto API Autor: Redacción Primicias Actualizada: Compartir: Un espectáculo astronómico por partida doble podrá ser contemplado desde Ecuador y otros países este jueves, 17 de octubre de 2024. Esta vez, la Luna del Cazador[ acompañará al ‘cometa del siglo’](https://www.primicias.ec/ciencia-tecnologia/tsuchinshan-cometa-fecha-ecuador-observatorio-astronomico-fecha-76883/) en el firmamento, apenas el Sol se oculte. La Luna del Cazador recibe su nombre de las antiguas tradiciones de los cazadores, quienes aprovechaban su luz para realizar cacerías nocturnas. Para los aficionados a la astronomía, es una oportunidad perfecta para conectar con la naturaleza y apreciar la belleza del cosmos. Además de ser luna llena, estará en su punto más cercano a la Tierra, por lo que podrá ser contemplada más grande y brillante de lo habitual. Para contemplar a plenitud estos eventos, es suficiente buscar un lugar oscuro, ya que tanto la Luna como el ‘cometa del siglo’ son visibles sin necesidad de binoculares o telescopios. Horarios para ver al cometa El 'cometa del siglo', hasta que termine octubre de 2024, puede observarse a simple vista en lugares alejados de la contaminación lumínica, con una magnitud estelar (brillo) real de 3,82. Las mejores horas para su observación son entre las 18:45 y las 19:35, mirando hacia el oeste. Actualmente, el cometa es visible en la constelación de la Serpiente y está aproximadamente a 22,41 grados a la derecha de Venus en el cielo. El Observatorio Astronómico de Quito abrirá sus puertas al público, a partir de las 18:00, aunque se requiere de un registro previo en su página web para poder ingresar. Siempre que las condiciones del clima lo permitan, el cometa C/2023 A3, conocido como Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, es visible desde todo el territorio ecuatoriano. Este objeto espacial se encuentra a una distancia de 77 millones de kilómetros de la Tierra. Este cometa no es de tipo periódico, lo que significa que no realiza retornos regulares al Sistema Solar interior. De hecho, expertos señalan que no volverá sino después de 80.000 años. A medida que el cometa se aleja de la Tierra, su visibilidad disminuirá. Para el 25 de octubre, su magnitud estelar será de 5, lo que hará necesario el uso de telescopios para observarlo. Para el 1 de noviembre, el cometa estará a 1 Unidad Astronómica (UA), equivalente a 150 millones de kilómetros que es la distancia entre el Sol y la Tierra. El cometa C/2023 A3 fue descubierto el 9 de enero de 2023 por el Observatorio de la Montaña Púrpura en China y su descubrimiento fue confirmado por el sistema ATLAS el 22 de febrero del mismo año. Se cree que el cometa proviene de la Nube de Oort, una región distante del Sistema Solar. Su núcleo está compuesto principalmente de hielo, polvo y material rocoso, y al aproximarse al Sol, estos materiales se subliman, formando la cola de gas y polvo. Estas colas pueden alcanzar millones de kilómetros. Compartir:",

    "text": "(CNN) — An implant for obstructive sleep apnea — a serious sleep malady in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to two minutes many times an hour each night — works best in people who are overweight but not severely obese, a new study found. To qualify for the device, called a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, a person over 18 diagnosed with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea must be unable to adapt or refuse to wear a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine, the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. The new study, published Thursday in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery, looked at the body mass index of 76 patients who had received the implant, said senior author Dr. Eric Landsness, an assistant professor of neurology and sleep medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Currently, the implant surgery, which costs between $50,000 and $100,000, is approved and covered by Medicare and many insurance companies for people with a BMI of up to 40. However, “we found for people with a BMI of more than 32, the device might be unsuccessful up to 75% of the time,” Landsness said. “It was a linear relationship: For each unit increase in BMI beyond 32, the odds of successful treatment decreased by approximately 17%.” As currently defined , a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is a healthy weight, between 25 and 29.5 is overweight, between 30 and 34.9 is obese, between 35 and 39.5 is class 2 obesity, and anything over 40 is “severe” or class 3 obesity, which used to be called morbid obesity. People are considered underweight if their BMI is lower than 18.5. The study also found the implant was less successful for people who slept on their backs, or what is called the supine position. The study’s results are consistent with earlier research that showed the efficacy of the device; however, “it also raises questions about whether obesity or supine sleeping limit its effectiveness,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved with the study. “There’s a huge unmet need of patients that are suffering with obstructive sleep apnea and not able to tolerate CPAP,” Landsness said. “But this is a surgery, which always carries risk, and it’s expensive, so as doctors we need to be sure the stimulator is the right choice for that patient.” Adjusting to CPAP To use a CPAP, a sleeper places a mask over the nose and mouth, then seals the mask to the face with straps and turns on a machine connected to the mask by a hose. Based on that person’s unique requirements, the machine provides air at a pressure just high enough to prevent the collapse of the airway during sleep. Many people, however, find the mask claustrophobic and ill-fitting, the tubing constrictive and cumbersome and the air pressure either inadequate or too forceful. Many people wake up frequently during the adjustment period, leading some to say their sleep is worse than before starting treatment. About a third of patients have difficulty using a CPAP and may ultimately abandon the device, Landsness said. If enlarged tonsils, a deviated septum or excessive soft tissue in the throat cause the apnea, a person may require surgery to treat those problems, he added. Besides CPAP and surgery, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are minimal, such as dental appliances that try to move the tongue forward, or behavioral changes such as losing weight and asking people to sleep on their sides instead of their backs. “Rather than not treating the condition, and facing the potential health consequences, the hypoglossal nerve stimulator treatment offers an opportunity that did not previously exist,” said Dr. Brandon Peters-Mathews, who is board-certified in both neurology and sleep medicine and practices at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. He was not involved in the study. “Most people recover fairly quickly after surgery, with pain eased in the first days,” Peters-Mathews said in an email. “The device is activated 1 month into use and there can be some discomfort as the intensity of the stimulation is increased. Side effects rarely undermine the therapy.” What is a hypoglossal nerve stimulator? The US Food and Drug Administration first approved the hypoglossal nerve stimulator in 2014, and to date the device has been implanted in 60,000 people worldwide, according to the manufacturer . A surgeon places a small instrument, much like a pacemaker, under the skin near the collarbone. Another impact is placed under the jaw, then attached to a nerve that controls the tongue. Both devices are connected with a wire implanted along the neck. Activated at night via remote control, the apparatus detects each breath and electrically activates the tongue to keep it from obstructing the airway. “It’s opening your airway by stimulating your tongue to basically move forward,” Landsness said. “The biggest complaint we hear from people is that sometimes their tongue feels tired because that muscle is stimulated over and over again.” However, it can take up to a year from the first doctor’s visit to full adaptation to the device, with a number of important steps needed along the way, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at Huntington Health in Pasadena, California. “You must visit an otolaryngologist who will do a procedure called DISE — drug-induced sleep endoscopy — and put a scope called an endoscope through the nose to look at the collapse of the upper airway,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study. “If the collapse is front to back, such as the tongue falling into the back of the throat, they may be a candidate for the procedure,” he said. “Then you have to do a sleep study to see how much stimulation will be needed to find the correct settings, and sometimes patients don’t tolerate it.” A dangerous, widespread condition Nearly 1 billion people worldwide have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in which breathing stops for seconds to minutes between 30 to 100 times per hour, according to estimates 30198-5/abstract). Another 425 million people are thought to have a mild to moderate version of the dangerous condition — for those people, breathing stops between five and 29 times per hour. Imagine what happens when the body stops breathing or doesn’t breathe enough: Oxygen levels, for example, can plummet each night to levels that rushed people with Covid-19 respiratory distress into intensive care during the pandemic. The ongoing oxygen deprivation can lead to a host of serious medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke and arrhythmias, a disruption in heart rhythm that can lead to sudden death, according to the Mayo Clinic . Obstructive sleep apnea is also connected to type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thyroid disease and mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Yet many people with the condition have no idea they are denying their brains and bodies life-sustaining oxygen, often going undiagnosed until a sleep partner complains of excessive snoring or gasping during sleep, two telltale signs. “People wake up just enough to start breathing when this happens but often not enough to regain consciousness,” Landsness said. “They can go on like that for years without realizing why they have a lack of focus, low energy and excessive sleepiness during the day.” New solutions to treat obstructive sleep apnea are desperately needed, so the stimulator’s advent was welcome news to doctors desperate to offer their patients a solution, Landsness said. “As an alternative treatment for sleep apnea, this hypoglossal nerve stimulation surgery could revolutionize some people’s lives,” he said. “I’ve had patients cry with joy after they have recovered because they have tried so hard and failed with CPAP, and we finally found something that works for them. “However, it seems a person’s weight seems to be an important factor that predicts whether or not they will respond successfully to the treatment,” he said. “As a sleep doctor, I want this treatment to be given to patients, but I want it to be given to the right patients, the ones who will benefit the most.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "HOPEWELL, Va. -- For the second year in a row, the city of Hopewell will utilize an old city-owned building to serve as an inclement weather shelter. \"It's a much-needed thing,\" said Beacon Hill Church Pastor Michael Moore. \"Huge plus, huge need, so thankful and we're happy to be a part of supporting them.\" The shelter is different from others in the area as it houses men and women in separate areas of the building at night. \"This is a safe place, where those individuals can come and get the services they need, which is a bed to sleep in, a warm meal and just a safe warm place,\" Director of Hopewell Department of Social Services Wanda Williams said. \"We don’t want our Citizens to be out in the elements during that time of the year, especially late at night when the temperatures drop.” The shelter is the only nighttime, winter shelter that is open in the Tri-Cities area. With rain and snow possible in the forecast, the shelter is already a safe haven that receives plenty of use. \"It's estimated it could be as many as 30, that do not have a place to lay their head at night, a warm stable place,\" Williams said. Even though not all without a home are willing to come to a shelter, they say there is enough room in the building to add more beds. \"To have this facility and have this space available for those who don’t have any alternatives, it makes me feel good,\" Williams said. \"I think what it says to the citizens of Hopewell, as well as across the Country, is that we are concerned about our Homeless Population and it is important to us, we ensure their safety.” The Hopewell Inclement Weather Shelter will run through March, from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. In the summer months, during intense heart, an alternate location will be open during the daytime hours.

    "text": "Maduro se reuniÃ³ con la cÃºpula militar venezolana Prensa Miraflores Maduro se reuniÃ³ con la cÃºpula militar venezolana El presidente de Venezuela, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, dijo este jueves que ordenÃ³ \"la activaciÃ³n de una acciÃ³n conjunta defensiva de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana\" frente a las costas del Esequibo, regiÃ³n que su paÃs se disputa con la vecina Guyana.\nLa noticia se conoce pocos dÃas despuÃ©s de que el gobierno britÃ¡nico anunciara que enviarÃ¡ un barco de guerra a Guyana en un gesto de apoyo diplomÃ¡tico y militar a su antigua colonia.\nEn una reuniÃ³n con el alto mando militar transmitida por la televisiÃ³n estatal, Maduro asegurÃ³ que el envÃo del patrullero britÃ¡nico HMS Trent supone una â€œrupturaâ€ del espÃritu del acuerdo que alcanzÃ³ con el presidente guyanÃ©s, Irfan Ali, para no usar la fuerza en la resoluciÃ³n de las diferencias entre ambos paÃses en la reuniÃ³n que ambos lÃderes mantuvieron en San Vicente y las Granadinas el pasado 14 de diciembre.\nMaduro dijo que el despliegue del buque britÃ¡nico \"es prÃ¡cticamente una amenaza militar de Londres contra nuestro paÃs\" .\nAÃ±adiÃ³ que ambas partes acordaron evitar la presencia de â€œfuerzas militares extra regionales en el Caribeâ€ y concluyÃ³ que â€œesto es una ruptura de los acuerdosâ€.\nEl presidente venezolano no dio detalles de en quÃ© consistirÃ¡ la acciÃ³n militar que ha ordenado, pero algunos de los mandos militares que participaron en la reuniÃ³n televisada indicaron que habÃa 5.600 efectivos listos para el operativo.\nMaduro se reuniÃ³ con el presidente guyanÃ©s, Irfan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre. EPA Maduro se reuniÃ³ con el presidente guyanÃ©s, Irfan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre. El Esequibo y la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana La acciÃ³n militar anunciada por Maduro supone el Ãºltimo episodio del litigio entre Venezuela y Guyana por la regiÃ³n del Esequibo, un territorio de unos 160.000 kilÃ³metros cuadrados, la mayorÃa de selva impenetrable que Caracas reclama como suyos desde que en 1899 un laudo internacional dictaminara que pertenecÃa a Reino Unido, entonces la potencia colonial que poseÃa lo que luego fue la Guyana independiente.\nEl contencioso se ha venido arrastrando con diferente intensidad desde entonces y se ha agravado en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os, despuÃ©s de que se descubrieran en la zona importantes yacimientos de crudo y gas , y el gobierno guyanÃ©s concediera licencias para su explotaciÃ³n a la energÃ©tica estadounidense ExxonMobil.\nEl asunto estÃ¡ en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, cuya autoridad sobre el caso Venezuela no reconoce.\nEl pasado 4 de diciembre el gobierno venezolano celebrÃ³ un referÃ©ndum en que la mayorÃa de votantes se mostraron a favor de incorporar el Esequibo como un nuevo estado de la RepÃºblica Bolivariana .\nEn un intento por rebajar la tensiÃ³n, Maduro se vio el 14 de diciembre con su homÃ³logo guyanÃ©s en un encuentro facilitado por la diplomacia brasileÃ±a y ambos acordaron rebajar la tensiÃ³n y descartaron el uso de la fuerza.\nPero la entrada en escena del gobierno britÃ¡nico y el envÃo de un buque militar a la zona ha provocado la reacciÃ³n de Venezuela\nCasi en simultÃ¡neo con la apariciÃ³n televisiva de Maduro, la CancillerÃa venezolana afirmÃ³ en un comunicado que Caracas se â€œreserva todas las acciones, en el marco de la ConstituciÃ³n y el derecho internacional, para defender su integridad marÃtima y territorial â€.\nEl patrullero HMS Trent, que Londres enviarÃ¡ al Caribe en medio de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana. PA El patrullero HMS Trent, que Londres enviarÃ¡ al Caribe en medio de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana. El buque britÃ¡nico El Ministerio de Defensa britÃ¡nico confirmÃ³ el pasado fin de semana que el buque HMS Trent participarÃ¡ en ejercicios conjuntos con Guyana despuÃ©s de la Navidad.\nGuyana, un miembro de la Mancomunidad BritÃ¡nica , es el Ãºnico paÃs de habla inglesa en SudamÃ©rica.\nEl HMS Trent cuenta con 65 tripulantes, una velocidad mÃ¡xima de 24 nudos y un alcance de 5.000 millas nÃ¡uticas.\nEl barco estÃ¡ armado con caÃ±ones de 30 mm y un contingente de cadetes de la Marina Real. TambiÃ©n puede desplegar helicÃ³pteros tipo Merlin y aeronaves no tripuladas.\nEl HMS Trent zarpÃ³ de su puerto base en Gibraltar a comienzos de diciembre y actualmente se encuentra atracado en Bridgetown, la capital de Barbados, durante la Navidad.\nSe anticipa que el barco de guerra eche ancla frente a la capital de Guyana, Georgetown, y realice visitas, actividades conjuntas y entrenamiento con la marina de ese paÃs y otros aliados . No puede atracar en el puerto por que este no es suficientemente profundo.\nEl ministro de Defensa de Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, se pronunciÃ³ el domingo sobre el anuncio a travÃ©s de la red social X (antes Twitter):\nâ€œÂ¿Un buque de guerra en aguas por delimitar? Â¿Y entonces? Â¿Y el compromiso con la buena vecindad y la convivencia pacÃfica? Â¿Y el acuerdo de no amenazarse y utilizar la fuerza mutuamente en ninguna circunstancia?\nÂ¡Seguimos alertas ante estas provocaciones que ponen en riesgo la paz y la estabilidad del Caribe y nuestra AmÃ©rica!â€, seÃ±alÃ³ el funcionario.\nBBC Recuerda que puedes recibir notificaciones de BBC News Mundo.
