    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Monseñor pidió rezar por las vocaciones, pero también recordó al clero usar el poder que le confiere la consagración en servicio a los demás. Los exhortó a mantener viva su misión para estar cerca de las personas en todo momento\nCarmela Delgado, Deisy Ortiz Duran.\nFuente:\nEl Deber\nEn el marco de la celebración de renovación de las promesas sacerdotales, monseñor René Leigue, arzobispo de Santa Cruz, pidió a los laicos orar y cuidar a los religiosos, porque la iglesia necesita más pastores que impulsen al pueblo.\n“Cuídenlos, son pocos los que hay. Necesitamos más sacerdotes, más personas que digan sí al Señor. Les pido a ustedes laicos que oren por más sacerdotes, por las vocaciones y por los jóvenes. Felicidades hermanos sacerdotes, que el Señor los acompañe y les dé siempre esa fortaleza y esa sabiduría para cuidar a su pueblo”, subrayó Leigue al finalizar la eucaristía.\nEl arzobispo aprovechó este espacio para reflexionar a los sacerdotes y pedirles que estén más cerca de la gente y no olviden el compromiso que hicieron en la consagración.\n“Nosotros hemos sido consagrados y ungidos por el espíritu, y en ese momento fuimos enviados para anunciar esa buena noticia a los pobres y anunciar la liberación a los cautivos. En ese momento que hemos dicho sí al Señor, nos hemos comprometido para anunciar esa buena noticia”.\nLes pidió mantener viva su misión y no distorsionar el poder que se les confirió. “El espíritu nos da esa fuerza y la unción nos ha dado el poder, pero no un poder como lo podemos percibir en nuestra sociedad. El poder que el espíritu nos ha dado en la ordenación es para el servicio. El poder se manifiesta y se transforma en servicio, por eso cuando hablamos de sacerdocio hablamos también de que tenemos ese poder que Dios nos ha dado, no para tratar mal a los demás, sino para servir”.\nTambién los exhortó a estar siempre fortalecidos espiritualmente para vencer al mal. “En medio de una sociedad que vivimos, tan complicada, donde hay tantos problemas, tantas dificultades y nosotros estamos en medio. No nos dejemos vencer por el mal, no nos dejemos contaminar con esa decepción que a veces encontramos en el mismo pueblo. Cuantas personas encontramos decepcionadas con la realidad que viven y vienen a nosotros para escuchar una palabra diferente, para encontrar una palabra de ánimo y de aliento”, subrayó.\nLeigue recordó que los sacerdotes son una pieza fundamental en la sociedad, pero lamentó que a veces pasan desapercibidos y solo cobran notoriedad cuando se equivocan.\n“En medio de esta realidad que vivimos no tenemos que dejarnos vencer por el mal y tenemos que luchar cada día”.\nPidió a los sacerdotes que en los momentos de crisis recuerden el sí que dieron al Señor. “Tenemos que recuperar esa fuerza, esa alegría de ser sacerdote. La gente confía en nosotros, no los defraudemos”.\nAgradeció por el servicio que brindan en la Arquidiócesis de Santa Cruz, tanto a los que son nacidos en esta tierra, como a los que llegan de afuera. “No se olviden que vienen a servir en la arquidiócesis y mientras están aquí hagan su trabajo con gusto, no piensen solamente que están de paso”.\nEl papa en la misa Crismal\nEn la misa Crismal celebrada en el Vaticano, el papa Francisco reflexionó sobre la necesidad de “la compunción (arrepentimiento) y las lágrimas” en los miembros de la iglesia.\n“No es un sentimiento de culpa que nos tumba por tierra, no es el escrúpulo que paraliza, sino un aguijón benéfico que quema por dentro y cura, porque el corazón, cuando ve el propio mal y se reconoce pecador, se abre, acoge la acción del Espíritu Santo, agua viva que lo sacude haciendo correr las lágrimas sobre el rostro. Quien se quita la máscara y deja que Dios mire su corazón recibe el don de estas lágrimas, que son las aguas más santas después de las del bautismo”, dijo el pontífice.\nAgregó que otra característica de la compunción es la solidaridad. “Un corazón dócil, liberado por el espíritu de las bienaventuranzas, se inclina naturalmente a hacer compunción por los demás; en vez de enfadarse o escandalizarse por el mal que cometen los hermanos, llora por sus pecados”.\nA los sacerdotes les recordó que el Señor no les pide juicios despectivos sobre los que no creen, sino amor y lágrimas por los que están alejados.\n“Las situaciones difíciles que vemos y vivimos, la falta de fe, los sufrimientos que tocamos, al entrar en contacto con un corazón compungido, no suscitan la determinación en la polémica, sino la perseverancia en la misericordia”, afirmó Francisco.\n“Cuánto necesitamos liberarnos de resistencias y recriminaciones, de egoísmos y ambiciones, de rigorismos e insatisfacciones, para encomendarnos e interceder ante Dios, encontrando en él una paz que salva de cualquier tempestad. Adoremos, intercedamos y lloremos por los demás. Permitamos al Señor que realice maravillas. No temamos, Él nos sorprenderá”, complementó.\nEl papa Francisco agradeció a los sacerdotes “por sus corazones abiertos y dóciles”. “Gracias por sus fatigas, sus lágrimas y por llevar la maravilla de la misericordia de Dios a los hermanos y hermanas de nuestro tiempo”.\nFuente:\nEl Deber",

    "title": "EU overcomes 'Orban fatigue,' passes €50 billion Ukraine aid – DW – 02/01/2024",
    "text": "Frustration with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was palpable among European Union (EU) leaders arriving at a summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss an aid package for Ukraine . For weeks, Orban had been holding back the EU from agreeing upon funds that would prop up Ukraine's economy, which has been straining under the ongoing war efforts after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nHowever, the leaders came to a surprisingly quick result: Within an hour of meeting, the 27 EU members signed off a new €50 billion ($54 billion) aid package to support Ukraine's economy through 2027. The funds consist of grants and loans financed from the EU budget.\nEU agrees €50 billion aid package for Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"We have a deal,\" European Council President Charles Michel announced on X, formerly Twitter. \"This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine. The EU is taking leadership and responsibility in support for Ukraine,\" he wrote.\nThe new cash injection is separate from the substantial military aid the EU and its member states send Kyiv. It is intended to pay for pensions and government salaries and to free up state funds.\n'Orban fatigue' sets in In recent years, Hungary's national-conservative leader Orban has frequently resorted to vetoes to hold up joint EU and NATO decisions, leaving fellow leaders increasingly exasperated, particularly with his stance towards Ukraine. Orban has also been public about his close ties with Russia , raising EU-wide concerns.\nWhile the shared EU position is to support and arm Kyiv \"as long as it takes\" in its war with Russia, Orban has frequently supported Moscow by delaying bloc measures and sanctions against Russia .\nHow much aid has Ukraine gotten from the EU? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe new leader of Poland , a country that until a recent change in government had frequently sided with Orban in some EU debates, had harsh words as he arrived on Thursday.\n\"There is no problem with so-called Ukraine fatigue. We have Orban fatigue,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. \"I can't understand. I can't accept this very strange egoistic game,\" he added, referring to Orban's unique stance in blocking EU anonymous decisions.\nOrban sees 'mission accomplished' The remaining 26 EU member states were prepared to sign off on the new funds for Ukraine the last time they met in December when the EU also agreed to open EU accession talks with Ukraine. Orban accepted the latter but not the former — hence the need for a dedicated extraordinary summit to revisit the issue on Thursday.\nOne of the points of contention in the deal was an annual mechanism for reviewing the aid package. The official joint EU concluding statement now refers to an annual \"debate\" on the fund and of the European Commission potentially conducting a review \"if needed\" in two years. Multiple diplomatic sources from other EU countries told DW they believed the review mechanism was toothless.\nNevertheless, following the signing of the deal, Orban claimed political victory. \"Mission accomplished,\" he posted on X. \"We have a control mechanism at the end of the first and the second year,\" he added, omitting the agreement's details.\nOn Thursday, leader came to a quick breakthrough Image: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images Orban is locked in a long-standing dispute with EU officials who reprimand him for the backsliding of Hungarian democracy under his government. Their most substantial move to date has been withholding EU funds earmarked for Budapest in exchange for rule of law reforms.\n'Two bitter pills' Several diplomats told DW the path to a quick agreement was cleared by a string of meetings between various leaders ahead of time. One official told DW that Germany played a large role in swaying Hungary by taking a tougher line than usual.\nThe same diplomat suggested that Hungary simply had to spread two concessions —one on the accession talks and the other on the new fund over two summits.\"It seems that the two bitter pills were too much for Orban to take in one summit so it had to be split into two,\" the source said.\nIt is not only Europe that is struggling politically to sign off assistance for Ukraine, funding is also held up in Washington Image: Liu Jie/Xinhua/picture alliance With European Council President Charles Michel hailing the summit as a victory for EU unity, it remains to be seen whether Orban will change tack or remain combative.\nElections for the European Parliament are set for June, and for the US presidency in November. In an EU-wide poll, the far right is expected to fare well, while Donald Trump could also return as leader in Washington. That would recast the political landscape in Orban's favor.\nZelenskyy sees ball passing to Washington Marta Mucznik, an analyst from the conflict resolution think tank International Crisis Group, said that while pressure had apparently brought Hungary's position around this time, Ukraine's allies' support was clearly under strain.\n\"It's increasingly contested ground, Western aid to Ukraine ,\" Mucznik said. \"It's not just an internal debate. It's a debate in the United States. It's a debate also within Europe among different member states with different foreign policy priorities, different threat perceptions, different sensitivities.\"\n\"As the war drags on (...) it becomes increasingly more difficult for the EU also to convince its own populations of the need to continue to back Ukraine,\" she said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the EU decision on Thursday. \"It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity,\" he posted on X. With an eye toward Washington, where Republican lawmakers have been stalling a package of aid planned by Democrat President Joe Biden, he also said that \"with today's big decisions, Europe is sending a signal across the Atlantic and around the world that the international rules-based world order will endure challenges.\"\nEdited by: Maren Sass",

    "text": "[Europe](../) Argentines protest against Milei’s deregulation and austerity Thousands of people in the country are unhappy with the new president’s controversial proposed changes. Thousands of Argentines have taken to the streets of Buenos Aires to protest a decree of sweeping economic reform and deregulation proposed by newly-elected President Javier Milei. Marching at the behest of labour unions, the protesters demanded the courts intervene to invalidate the mega-decree they say would carve away at worker and consumer protections. Congress is sitting in an extraordinary session this week, at the request of ultra-libertarian Milei – in office since 20 December 10 – to consider the plan. The decree would change or scrap more than 350 economic regulations in a country accustomed to heavy government intervention in the market. Among others, it abolishes a price ceiling on rent, eliminates some worker protections and scraps laws shielding consumers from abusive price increases at a time annual inflation exceeds 160% and the poverty level has surpassed 40%. A number of civic groups have recently filed a judicial motion to have the decree declared unconstitutional. On Wednesday, protesters waved Argentine flags and placards reading: “The homeland is not for sale.” “We do not question the legitimacy of President Milei, but we want him to respect the division of powers. Workers need to defend their rights when there is an unconstitutionality,” construction union leader Gerardo Martinez told reporters at the march. Milei’s “chainsaw plan” to cut state spending has triggered a series of street protests against the government. Other aspects of the decree include an end to automatic pension increases, restrictions on the right to strike – and easing away from price caps for private health services. It also terminates some 7,000 civil service contracts. Unless Congress scraps the plan in its entirety, the decree will enter into force on Friday. Milei’s far-right party, Freedom Advances, has 40 of the 257 deputies in Congress and seven of 72 senators. “The decree is destructive of all labour rights,” 45-year-old teacher Martin Lucero, who took part in the protest, said. “The Argentine people chose Milei as president of the nation, not as emperor,” he added.
