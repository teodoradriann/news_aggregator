    "title": "Le dimissioni del Papa spaccano (di nuovo) la Chiesa. Cosa sta succedendo",
    "text": "Dimissioni è la parola del momento. Il Papa non è fuori pericolo e il rischio sepsi è ancora concreto, ma fuori dal Gemelli cardinali ed esperti hanno aperto il dibattito sulla rinuncia. A rompere il tabù non sono stati quei prelati ritenuti critici nei confronti dell'attuale pontificato, ma chi si è sempre dimostrato in linea con l'agenda bergogliana.\nI possibilisti\nIl primo a parlarne pubblicamente è stato il cardinale Gianfranco Ravasi che ha ripetuto in due interviste di ritenere possibile il passo indietro di Francesco in caso di difficoltà gravi. Anche gli arcivescovi di Marsiglia e di Barcellona, i cardinali Jean-Marc Aveline e Juan José Omella Omella hanno evocato quest'ipotesi, ricordando che le norme lo prevedono e sentenziando che \"tutto è possibile\". Anche il cardinale Jean-Claude Hollerich, arcivescovo lussemburghese, ha detto che l'eventuale passo indietro dipenderà da come il Pontefice si riprenderà dalla malattia. Si tratta di cardinali di peso, tutti esponenti del mondo progressista e tenaci interpreti della sensibilità di questo pontificato. Francesco era intervenuto più volte sul tema dimissioni, dicendo di non chiudere del tutto la porta a quest'opzione e preannunciando che in caso avrebbe assunto il titolo di vescovo emerito di Roma e sarebbe andato a vivere a San Giovanni in Laterano. Uno scenario, quello immaginato da Francesco stesso, che il professore di Storia contemporanea della Chiesa presso la Pontificia Università Gregoriana, Roberto Regoli - intervistato da Franca Giansoldati de \"Il Messaggero\" - sembra ritenere poco credibile perché \"conoscendo il suo carattere a me risulta assai difficile immaginarlo ai giardinetti come un pensionato\".\nUn dibattito che non piace a tutti\nIl dibattito animato da Ravasi sulle dimissioni, con l'appendice di Regoli che si è spinto a chiedere la codificazione del passo indietro e dell'emeritato nella sua intervista, non sembra essere piaciuto a tutti. Pesano le tempistiche: il Papa è in ospedale, non ancora fuori pericolo. \"Non vedo perché parlare di dimissioni\", ha detto a \"La Repubblica\" lo storico e fondatore della Comunità di Sant'Egidio Andrea Riccardi. Anche monsignor Bruno Forte, arcivescovo di Chieti-Vasto e teologo di riferimento nella prima parte del pontificato bergogliano, ha osservato che \"siccome questa malattia non lo ha assolutamente invalidato e sta addirittura migliorando, io non vedo la necessità di parlare di dimissioni\". Il mormorio sulle dimissioni non è piaciuto anche a Pietro Parolin, cardinale segretario di Stato e candidato favorito in un eventuale futuro conclave, per il quale le voci sulle dimissioni \"sembrano tutte inutili speculazioni\".

    "title": "Urban Spaces for an Overheated Planet: 12 Projects that tackle this Global Challenge",
    "text": "Due to [climate change](https://www.archdaily.com/tag/climate-change), heat waves are becoming increasingly frequent and intense, and they present a critical challenge for the design of urban spaces. Elevated temperatures exacerbate [public health issues](https://www.archdaily.com/tag/public-health), increase [energy ](https://www.archdaily.com/tag/energy)consumption, and diminish cities' overall [quality of life](https://www.archdaily.com/898265/what-affects-the-quality-of-life-in-urban-environments). [Urban design](https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/urban-design) must adopt strategies that promote [resilience ](https://www.archdaily.com/tag/resilience)to mitigate these effects rather than merely replicating traditional formats that do not address the thermal stress experienced by many. For quite some time, we have recognized the positive effects of urban green spaces, interaction with nature, water, and soil, and the associated health and well-being benefits for residents living next to parks. The significance of this matter has been further underscored, particularly in the aftermath of the panic induced by the [Covid-19](https://www.archdaily.com/tag/covid-19) pandemic. However, the present moment once again highlights the influence of our urban models on modern life, now grappling with unprecedented extreme temperatures. The outlook for the future is disheartening. According to the United Nations, without intervention, we are on track to reach an average temperature of 3.7°C higher than the pre-industrial revolution period by the year 2100. This trajectory threatens entire ecosystems and appears to jeopardize our urban way of life. In this context, architects and urban planners bear the responsibility, among other environmental concerns, to adapt cities to this evolving reality. Recognizing the magnitude of the challenge, in recent years at ArchDaily, we've endeavored to tackle the issue from various angles. One notable article, [How to Adapt Cities to Extreme Heat](https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/1005222/como-adaptar-cidades-para-o-calor-extremo), explored compelling strategies to address this challenge, including the significance of green spaces, the revival of traditional cooling methods, and the use of light colors. Another noteworthy piece introduced the concept of [urban oases](https://www.archdaily.com/1010388/what-is-an-urban-oasis-combating-the-excessive-heat-of-cities) as potential solutions to alleviate thermal stress caused by heat for individuals in public spaces - this encompasses not only those experiencing homelessness but also pedestrians who spend extended hours commuting through the city. Regardless of the strategy applied or the scale of the intervention, one undeniable fact stands out: we must examine our cities and design resilient spaces that signify an improved quality of life. Keeping this challenge in focus, we provide a list below of urban projects that are examples of public spaces ready to tackle the challenges of an overheated planet. These projects offer users vegetated surfaces, natural materials, water elements, and extensive shaded areas.",

    "text": "Case Constuction Equipment, presente en España a través de la filial CNH Industrial Maquinaria Spain, continúa ampliando su oferta de excavadoras compactas sobre cadenas buscando responder a las necesidades de todos los clientes, independientemente de la aplicación. Las últimas incorporaciones a una gama que ya supera las 20 opciones individuales son los nuevos modelos midi de la Serie E, diseñados para cubrir el segmento de 8 a 10 t de peso operativo.\nPara quien busca una excavadora de giro sin cola con pluma fija tipo monobloque, similar a un modelo de orugas de tamaño completo, la CX85E —con un peso operativo de 8.830 kg— es la opción adecuada. Las empresas que prefieren una solución con pluma oscilante, como en una miniexcavadora, para facilitar el trabajo en espacios reducidos, pueden optar por la CX90E, que pesa 9.210 kg. La máxima versatilidad, aseguran desde la compañía, la ofrece la CX100E: con un peso de 10.080 kg, combina un diseño de giro sin cola con una pluma articulada de dos piezas y función de giro de pluma, lo que permite mayor alcance horizontal y altura de descarga.\nPor otro lado, ante la necesidad de mayor estabilidad y capacidad de elevación, los modelos CX85E y CX90E pueden equiparse con un contrapeso adicional de 440 kg, que viene de serie en la CX100E. Este contrapeso, montado internamente, no afecta al perfil compacto de giro, manteniendo las dimensiones reducidas de estas máquinas de 8 a 10 t. Además, los tres modelos pueden incorporar un contrapeso externo adicional de 900 kg si se requiere.\nNiveles de prestaciones\nLas tres excavadoras están equipadas con un motor diésel de 53,7 kW (73 CV) y una bomba hidráulica de caudal variable, que permite seleccionar entre tres modos de funcionamiento: Económico, Estándar y Potencia. Además, el operador puede personalizar una configuración adicional, ajustando la velocidad de cada función hidráulica según sus preferencias para optimizar el rendimiento y la eficiencia del consumo.\nLas máquinas también ofrecen hasta tres circuitos auxiliares, configurables según los requisitos de caudal de los distintos implementos, lo que garantiza un funcionamiento eficaz y versátil. Los joysticks incorporan interruptores de rodillo electroproporcionales que permiten controlar las funciones auxiliares con precisión y comodidad, directamente con la punta de los dedos.\nCase también ha incorporado un modo de desplazamiento mediante joystick, que permite al operador controlar todas las funciones de traslación directamente desde el joystick izquierdo. Esta función resulta especialmente útil en tareas de relleno y nivelación con la hoja dózer. Los tres modelos están equipados con transmisión de doble velocidad y reducción automática cuando es necesario, lo que garantiza la tracción cualquier condición de trabajo.\nEl operador también disfrutará de una cabina de alta gama, con tres opciones de asiento disponibles, incluyendo suspensión mecánica o neumática y calefacción. Los joysticks, de diseño ergonómico y con botones intuitivos, junto con los controles electroproporcionales tipo rodillo, buscan maximizar la productividad y reducir la fatiga. La pantalla multifunción permite acceder fácilmente a los menús de control, diagnósticos y ajustes hidráulicos.\nLos componentes del sistema de aire acondicionado se han ubicado en el alerón trasero del techo, que gira dentro del contorno del contrapeso. Esta disposición mejora la visibilidad desde la cabina, mientras que los retrovisores y las cámaras proporcionan una visión completa de la máquina. El sistema de iluminación LED completa el paquete de visibilidad, asegurando la visión en cualquier condición de luz o clima.\nAcceso fácil y soluciones de servicios\nLas excavadoras midi Case, afirman desde la compañía, están diseñadas para ofrecer un rendimiento fiable y facilitar el mantenimiento diario. Los modelos de 8 a 10 t cuentan con amplias puertas de acceso y una cabina basculante, que permiten un acceso sencillo a todos los puntos de servicio. Además, incorporan un ventilador reversible que ayuda a eliminar polvo y residuos del sistema de refrigeración, mientras que todos los filtros y puntos de llenado son fácilmente accesibles desde el nivel del suelo.\nLas excavadoras midi de la Serie E están respaldadas por toda la gama de servicios que ofrecen Case y su red de concesionarios, incluyendo la garantía extendida Case Protect y el programa de mantenimiento planificado Case Care. Este último ofrece distintas duraciones, niveles de cobertura y opciones de pago flexibles, lo que permite reducir el coste total de mantenimiento. Además, estos servicios pueden complementarse con soluciones personalizadas como el análisis de fluidos y las inspecciones periódicas, realizadas por técnicos especializados en los concesionarios Case.\nTodas las máquinas vienen equipadas con módulos telemáticos integrados que permiten la transmisión de datos en tiempo real y el envío de alertas inteligentes a concesionarios, clientes y operadores. Esta conectividad avanzada proporciona información clave sobre el rendimiento y el estado de la máquina. Case aplica inteligencia artificial y algoritmos avanzados para tratar de maximizar el tiempo de actividad y mejorar la productividad.\nPara los concesionarios Case, esto se traduce en una visibilidad total y acceso remoto al estado de cada máquina. Las alertas, recordatorios y notificaciones permiten anticiparse a las necesidades del cliente. Si se detecta un posible fallo, el sistema envía una alerta al concesionario con recomendaciones y acciones concretas para resolver el problema antes de que se agrave.\nPor su parte, los clientes disponen de 'myCaseconstruction', una aplicación y un portal dedicados que van más allá de la gestión tradicional de flotas. Más que una herramienta de seguimiento, finalizan desde la firma, es una plataforma centralizada que permite consultar información sobre las máquinas, gestionar obras y analizar informes de rendimiento, facilitando decisiones más inteligentes y un mayor control de los costes operativos.",
