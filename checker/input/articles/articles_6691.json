    "text": "Minnesota's Edouard Julien bashed a three-run home run as the Twins earned a split of their four-game series with the Tampa Bay Rays with a 4-3 victory Thursday afternoon in St. Petersburg, Fla. Julien went deep in the second and Matt Wallner followed with one in the third for a 4-0 lead that lifted the Twins (76-64) to a split against Tampa Bay (69-71). Ryan Jeffers had a double in a 2-for-4 day for Minnesota, which is 22-17 in one-run games and 37-34 on the road. Sitting at 2-2 on their seven-game road trip, the Twins will head to Kansas City to play three against the American League Central rival Royals. Twins starter Pablo Lopez (14-8) yielded three runs on seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He fanned nine with a walk. The red-hot right-hander recorded his sixth win in his past eight starts, though his career-high scoreless streak ended at 23 1/3 innings. Over seven innings, Tampa Bay's Taj Bradley (6-10) allowed four runs on six hits with a walk. He struck out 10, including Royce Lewis on an automatic third strike in the first inning. In his major league debut, reliever Mason Montgomery fired a scoreless eighth with a strikeout and a walk. Jonny DeLuca went 3-for-4 with a double and two runs, while Junior Caminero drove in two runs. Yandy Diaz had two hits with an RBI double and Christopher Morel tripled. Six of the seven games in the clubs' season series were decided by one run. Following singles by Jose Miranda and Carlos Santana to open the second inning, Julien crushed his eighth homer 392 feet to right field for a quick 3-0 lead. Minnesota flexed its muscle again in the third when Wallner jumped on a 2-0 pitch and lofted it into the first row in the right field seats. The homer was the right fielder's 11th. Caminero snapped Lopez's string of zeroes in the bottom half of the frame, lining a bases-loaded single to right to trim the Rays' deficit to 4-2. While Bradley settled in and held the Twins without a run over four innings, his club chipped away at Lopez. Diaz's RBI double to right in the seventh was reviewed for a rules check for more than 10 minutes after Wallner leaped over the short wall on the run. Minnesota's Jhoan Duran converted his 22nd save with a perfect ninth that featured two strikeouts. --Field Level Media\n[]",

    "text": "Social media users worldwide have been fooled by an AI-generated image that appears to show a massive fire engulfing a warehouse for Chinese e-commerce giant Temu. The social media user who created the image told AFP it was intended as a joke, and no official reports indicate such an incident happened as of January 7, 2025.\n\"Good thing I'm still at the add-to-cart stage,\" read Tagalog-language text overlaid on the image shared on Facebook on December 30, 2024.\nIt appears to show a big fire at a warehouse belonging to Temu, a shopping app owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings that has sucked in consumers across the world with its low prices ( archived link ).\n© AFP\nThe image spread online around the world, including in posts in English , Korean , Thai and French , with many social media users appearing to believe it showed a real inferno.\n\"Oh no what happens to my purchases?\" one commented.\n\"Gosh I buy most of my household items here,\" another wrote.\nAI-generated The picture features several clues that it was created with artificial intelligence, including a \"Grok\" watermark in the bottom right corner, which refers to the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk's company xAI.\nOther defects include the brand name misspelled as \"Tehu\" -- instead of \"Temu\" -- on the side of the warehouse and the inaccurate depiction of the company's official logo ( archived link ).\n© AFP\nWhile there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media , identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI.\n'Simply a joke' Reverse image searches on Google found an earlier upload of the image on the X account @DocAtCDI, who shared it with a humour-laden caption ( archived link ).\nIt read: \"A 57,000 square foot Temu warehouse in China went up in flames today. The total loss of inventory has been estimated to be as high as $56.19 USD.\"\nThe user confirmed to AFP on January 4 that they made the photo using AI.\n\"There is a watermark that was left in on the bottom right to make sure people would know it was AI generated, it was simply a joke,\" they said.\nThe same account has previously posted AI-generated images of a burning Temu building.\n© AFP\nFurther keyword searches on X uncovered an earlier post with a similar caption but a different AI-generated image of a burning Temu warehouse, as indicated by the appearance of a Grok watermark ( archived link ).\nFact-checking organisation Snopes noted that Irish satirical channel The Waterford Whispers News previously shared a similar version of the joke about a Temu warehouse fire in a video uploaded on September 3, 2024 (archived here and here ).\nAFP found no official reports of a Temu warehouse catching fire, as of January 7.\n<div",

Gen. Leo Francisco, CIDG director, said the firearms are registered under the name of Cresente Canada, one of the co-accused in the child abuse and qualified human trafficking cases filed against Quiboloy before the courts in Davao and Pasig cities.\nApart from the firearms, the KOJC also turned over 14 bullets for a .9mm caliber handgun and two CZ pistol magazines.\n“Active participation of the community and the public is essential in our fight against illegal firearms for a safer, secure nation,” Francisco said in a statement.\nThe firearms were brought to the CIDG-Davao field office for documentation and safekeeping.\nEarly this month, Quiboloy’s camp also surrendered five of 19 registered firearms.",
