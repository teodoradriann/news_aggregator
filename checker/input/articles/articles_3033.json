    "text": "WASHINGTON - The United States has ordered some staff to leave the embassy in Baghdad and authorized military service members’ families to depart the Middle East, officials said, after Iran threatened to target U.S. bases if nuclear negotiations collapse.\nThe decision to reduce staffing in Iraq was “based on our latest analysis,” according to the State Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized family members of U.S. troops stationed across the region to leave, the Pentagon said in a statement.\nNeither agency cited a specific threat. However, the New York Post published an interview in which President Donald Trump said he is growing less confident about the prospects for negotiations to impose new limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, meanwhile, warned of retaliation against U.S. military assets in the region if talks fail and the Islamic Republic is attacked.\n“I sincerely hope it won’t come to that and that the talks reach a resolution,” Iran’s Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said in televised remarks. “But if they don’t, and conflict is imposed on us, the other side will undoubtedly suffer greater losses. We will target all U.S. bases in host countries without hesitation.”\nWest Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped as much as 5.2% after Reuters reported that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is preparing for an ordered departure in response to rising security threats. Iraq is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nEarlier in the day, the British Navy issued a rare advisory to mariners, warning that rising tensions in the Middle East could disrupt shipping, including through the Strait of Hormuz. While shipping has long been risky in the region, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) rarely issues general alerts of this kind.\n“UKMTO has been made aware of increased tensions within the region, which could lead to an escalation of military activity having a direct impact on mariners,” the advisory stated. “Vessels are advised to transit the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz with caution.”\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center, part of the Combined Maritime Forces, also warned of elevated risks, including the potential use of missiles near strategic chokepoints.\nThe Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most critical oil chokepoint, and Iran has frequently threatened to close it during periods of geopolitical conflict, though it has never done so.\nHegseth’s move applies to families of U.S. service members stationed throughout the Central Command area of operations, which encompasses most of the Middle East.\n“Centcom is working in close coordination with our Department of State counterparts, as well as our allies and partners in the region to maintain a constant state of readiness to support any number of missions around the world at any time,” the Pentagon said in a statement.\nTehran said it is preparing a new proposal related to its nuclear activities ahead of the sixth round of talks in Muscat, the capital of Oman, scheduled for Sunday. The plan “can be used as a basis for work,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday, suggesting Iran may consider a temporary framework while technical issues - many of them complex - are further negotiated.\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he wants an agreement that curbs Iran’s nuclear activities and has not ruled out military action if talks fail. Israel, which considers a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat, has also said it may strike Iran - with or without U.S. support.\nIran has long denied pursuing a nuclear weapon.",

    "text": "Eyes to the Sky: The largest and brightest supermoon of 2024 expected tonight ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - The moon will look 30% brighter and 15% bigger Oct. 17 as the third of four consecutive supermoons occurs. Supermoon refers to the full moon that is in the 90% perigree, or the closest phase to the Earth. We have about three to four a year, and they happen consecutively. This is due to the elliptical rather than round nature of the moon’s orbit around the Earth. Tonight’s moon will be the closest of the 4 supermoons, as it will be 222,056 miles away from earth. This isn’t record-breaking by any means, as the moon was at a distance of 221,494 miles away in January 1948, and in November 2034 it will be even closer at 221,485 miles away. To put how close that is in perspective, we have to talk about when the moon is at its furthest point, or the apogee. The moon’s apogee is around 251,000 miles away, which is 12% further away than tonight’s moon position. Tonight‘s full moon is referred to as the hunter’s moon as it is the first full moon following the autumn equinox. We get the name from the indigenous people, as they benefited from the brightness of the moon as hunters prepared for long winters by using the moonlight to hunt deer. We have the fourth and final supermoon of 2024 on Nov. 15, but it won’t be as close as tonight’s. Copyright 2024 WIFR. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Российская туристка полностью лишилась слуха во время отдыха в Китае. После лечения, назначенного местными врачами, у нее также онемела половина тела.\nКак сообщает SHOT, 26-летняя жительница Санкт-Петербурга отправилась отдыхать в Санью в первых числах июля 2025 года. Начало поездки прошло прекрасно — пляжный отдых и экзотические фрукты. Однако в один из дней девушка проснулась с невыносимой болью в ушах, затруднявшей движение челюстью и глотание. Позже состояние усугубилось высокой температурой. На следующее утро она полностью утратила слух на оба уха.\nПара обратилась в китайскую клинику. Медики назначили кортикостероидные препараты. Не понимая логики такого лечения, туристка всё же приняла первую таблетку. Спустя полчаса она перестала ощущать левую часть тела. Врачи объяснили это побочной реакцией, однако позже выяснилось, что лекарство было прописано в существенно завышенной дозе.\nДевушка связалась со специалистами из России. Те предположили бактериальный отит, который мог развиться после купания в заливе, и рекомендовали антибактериальную терапию. С огромным трудом ей удалось получить рецепт и приобрести антибиотики в Санье (город окружного значения на юге острова Хайнань в одноимённой провинции Китая). Однако слух до сих пор не восстановился.\nЧитайте также: Тракторист сгорел заживо после череды аварий в российском регионе\n«МК» в MAX: главные новости — быстро, честно, рядом",

O presidente da FPF diz que o governador do Pará é próximo de Fernando Sarney, filho do ex-governador do Maranhão e atual vice-presidente da CBF, indicando que Helder estaria atuando em favor dele.\nComo mostrou o Painel, Ricardo Teixeira, ex-presidente da CBF, tem atuado para que Fernando Sarney seja o novo presidente da CBF .\n\"O Paysandu, o Maurício [Ettinger, presidente do clube] é paulista, conhece o trabalho de São Paulo, está encolhido, porque o governador do Pará, a mesma coisa que ele fez com o Ricardo [Gluck Paul, presidente da Federação Paraense de Futebol] —que aliás estava com a gente também, eram 10 [apoios à candidatura] com o Pará—, está fazendo uma pressão enorme nele\", disse Bastos em reunião com representantes de clubes da Liga Forte União na terça-feira (26).\nEle ainda diz que Barbalho e Sarney \"são muito amigos\".\n\"O que ele fez com o Ricardo [Gluck Paul] na federação do Pará é uma tristeza enorme, de grosseria, não tem mais R$1 para a federação, parece que a esposa dele tem um cargo público interessante, uma profissional competente. Ameaçou e, em resumo, ele não resistiu\", completou.\nReinaldo Carneiro Bastos, presidente da FPF, durante o Grande Prêmio São Paulo de F1 - Greg Salibian-5.nov.2023/Folhapress Quem ocupa cargo público relevante sob influência mais direta do governador é, na verdade, a irmã de Ricardo, Ana Carolina Gluck Paul, procuradora-geral adjunta do Pará. Luciana Gluck Paul, advogada e esposa de Ricardo, é professora da Universidade Federal do Pará e vice-presidente da OAB do Pará.\nA inscrição de candidatura para a presidência da CBF requer o apoio declarado de pelo menos cinco clubes e pelo menos oito federações estaduais. Bastos tem buscado essas alianças.\nA sucessão na entidade tem sido objeto de pressões de diversos setores da política. Arthur Lira (PP-AL), presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, tenta emplacar Gustavo Feijó, seu aliado e ex-presidente da Federação Alagoana de Futebol, no comando da CBF.\nEm nota, o governador Helder Barbalho nega \"qualquer tipo de participação em conversas ou candidaturas aos cargos da CBF\".\nProcurado pelo Painel, Bastos não quis se manifestar.\nA coluna procurou Gluck Paul por telefone e por mensagens de celular. Por telefonema, ele disse que estava fora do país e que a ligação estava ruim. Ele não respondeu às mensagens sobre o tema.\nA coluna não conseguiu contato com Mauricio Ettinger, presidente do Paysandu.\nO governador do Pará, Helder Barbalho (MDB), durante lançamento do Novo PAC - Tércio Teixeira-11.ago.2023/Folhapress LINK PRESENTE: Gostou deste texto?
