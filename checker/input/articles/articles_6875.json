    "text": "Trump 2020 Attorneys Face Disbarment, Suspension Ahead of 2024 Election WASHINGTON, D.C. — In the years since former President Donald Trump attempted to subvert the 2020 presidential election results, the attorneys who aided his efforts are facing the prospect of being banned from practicing law. The disciplinary actions could mean the attorneys who were on the frontlines for Trump in 2020 won’t have active law licenses in November. This year alone, courts and professional disciplinary boards that govern attorney conduct have [issued](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/dc-board-recommends-disbarment-for-rudy-giuliani-over-2020-election-lies/) [recommendations](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/former-trump-lawyer-john-eastman-should-be-disbarred-california-judge-rules/) for disbarment against two of Trump’s closest allies in his 2020 election fight — Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. Other former campaign attorneys like [ Jenna Ellis](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/colorado-court-suspends-jenna-elliss-law-license-for-three-years-for-2020-election-lies/) and Kenneth Chesebro have received suspensions in the states where they’re licensed to practice. All four attorneys were charged in criminal cases related to 2020. Where Trump’s former 2020 campaign attorneys stand in their disciplinary cases: Giuliani was among the first of Trump’s 2020 attorneys to face professional consequences. Roughly six months after a mob of Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a New York disciplinary committee [suspended](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/giuliani-suspended-from-new-york-bar-for-promoting-election-lies/) Giuliani’s license to practice law in the state. The committee found that Giuliani communicated “demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public” in connection with Trump’s reelection bid. Records show his license was [still suspended](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/attorneyservices/wicket/page/DetailsPage?3) as of June 6. In May, a disciplinary board for the Washington, D.C., bar concluded Giuliani should be disbarred in the nation’s capital for his 2020 efforts. His current D.C. status shows his law license [is under a temporary suspension](https://my.dcbar.org/directorymemberships?id=0014z00001kYbnUAAS). In his defense, Giuliani testified before the board’s committee that he did the best he could do “under the circumstances.” Eastman [is under fire](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/john-eastman-is-having-a-bad-time/) in part for his role in helping orchestrate the 2020 multistate scheme to have fake electors submit alternate election results claiming that Trump won. The plan involved then-Vice President Mike Pence certifying the fake electors when Congress convened to certify the winner on Jan. 6, 2021. Despite a pressure campaign from Trump and his allies, Pence certified Biden. In May, Eastman was [temporarily suspended](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-2020-lawyer-john-eastman-temporarily-suspended-from-practicing-law-in-washington-d-c/) from practicing law in Washington, D.C., pending the resolution of his disciplinary case in California, according to an [order](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Order_Sua_Sponte_Staying_Appeal-1.pdf) from the D.C. Court of Appeals. Records [show](https://my.dcbar.org/directorymemberships?id=0014z00001kaGtDAAU) Eastman was still suspended as of June 6. Eastman also played a substantial role in perpetuating false allegations of widespread ballot fraud, as detailed in the State Bar Court of California’s [report](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SBC-23-O-30029-Decision-Trial.pdf). In March, [a judge ruled](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/former-trump-lawyer-john-eastman-should-be-disbarred-california-judge-rules/) that he should be disbarred for his conduct. The California bar’s website shows [he is not eligible](https://apps.calbar.ca.gov/attorney/Licensee/Detail/193726) to practice law in the state. The website also [shows](https://apps.calbar.ca.gov/attorney/Licensee/Detail/236022) that Chesebro, another 2020 attorney for Trump who aided the former president in the fake elector scheme, is also no longer eligible, meaning he’s unable to practice law in California. California court [documents](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SBC-23-C-31017-Order-Ruling-on-Motion-to-Classify-Granted.pdf) show that after Chesebro in October [pleaded guilty](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/kenneth-chesebro-pleads-guilty-in-fulton-county-election-subversion-case/) to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents in the Georgia election subversion [case](https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/georgia-former-president-donald-trump-indictment/), the State Bar Court of California moved to suspend Chesebro’s license, effective Feb. 19. The website notes that Chesebro and two other Trump allies [were each charged](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/ex-trump-campaign-attorney-kenneth-chesebro-2-others-charged-in-wisconsin/) this month with forgery for their role in the fake elector scheme in Wisconsin. Last year, right-wing attorney and vocal Trump supporter L. Lin Wood decided to retire permanently from law, according to a [letter](https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1676570282360807426) he sent in July to the State Bar of Georgia. His [current status](https://www.gabar.org/MemberSearchDetail.cfm?ID=Nzc0NTg4) is listed as “retired.” News outlets [reported](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/politics/lin-wood-law-license/index.html) that Wood’s retirement was an apparent attempt to fend off disciplinary proceedings stemming from his conduct after the 2020 election. Though Wood denied that he [retired](https://t.me/linwoodspeakstruth/31848) out of fear of disbarment. What makes these cases unique: Disbarment and lengthy suspensions often happen in cases involving an attorney and their client, a legal ethics expert told Democracy Docket. What makes these cases different is the impact of their claims, which sought to halt and undermine the democratic process based on allegations for which there was no concrete proof. “It’s a type of situation [that’s] outside of the routine, traditional types of cases that disciplinary boards are usually looking at,” Arthur Burger, a D.C., attorney and expert on legal ethics and professional responsibility, told Democracy Docket. In Giuliani’s D.C. case, for instance, he faces disbarment primarily for his involvement in [Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. v. Boockvar](https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/pennsylvania-democratic-counties-challenge/) — a case that alleged without evidence that election fraud took place in multiple Democratic counties in Pennsylvania. Board members explained in their [report](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-31-report-and-recommendation-of-the-board-on-professional-responsibility.pdf) that Giuliani’s conduct during the case violated Pennsylvania’s professional rules for attorneys, specifically Rule 3.1 that says a lawyer cannot bring or defend a proceeding or asset and issue unless there is a “basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous.” The board said it agreed with its committee’s earlier findings that the Pennsylvania case was based “only on speculation, mistrust, and suspicion.” “When you have that level of disregard for integrity,” Burger said, “when you’re making assertions that important, it’s so impactful that you’re eroding the rule of law itself, and you’re eroding the foundations of a democratic government.” [Read more about the D.C. bar’s disciplinary case against Rudy Giuliani here.](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/dc-board-recommends-disbarment-for-rudy-giuliani-over-2020-election-lies/) [Read more about the California case against John Eastman here.](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/former-trump-lawyer-john-eastman-should-be-disbarred-california-judge-rules/)",

    "text": "The cinematic landscape of 2023 witnessed a renaissance in animation, solidifying its place as one of the greatest years for the medium. The ubiquity of animated features, spearheaded by notable releases, contributed to the industry's success. Notably, if not for the phenomenon that is “Barbie,” the chart-topping movie of the year would undoubtedly have been “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” Let's not even get started on [Spider-Man](https://clutchpoints.com/metro-boomin-puts-aside-upcoming-album) (don't worry, we will later), but Sony is finally doing something right with a Marvel character. Across the Spider-Verse inspired, [hired a teenage artist to do the LEGO scene](https://ew.com/movies/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-lego-scene-animated-by-14-year-old/), and left us all with one of the greatest cliffhangers audiences have seen in recent years, EW reports. However, it's not just the sheer quantity of animated films that defined the greatness of 2023; it's the originality within larger franchises, coupled with a diverse array of animation styles—from stop-motion to computer animation and traditional animation—that brought these creations to life. Previous years set a high bar with masterpieces like Klaus, Wolfwalkers, and Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Although 2023 presented a more eclectic and uneven collection of films, it continued the trend of delivering spectacular animated offerings. Each film, regardless of scale, found its place, showcasing the beauty of animation as a medium. Without further ado, let's delve into the standout animated features of 2023: ‘Elemental': Pixar's Heartfelt Marvel Pixar's latest offering, “Elemental,” emerged as a testament to the studio's storytelling prowess. Set in a modern metropolis where characters based on the elements coexist, the film revolves around the romance between Ember, a fiery character voiced by Leah Lewis, and Wade, a water-based character played by Mamoudou Athie. Directed by Peter Sohn, the film not only captivates with its gorgeously rendered technological marvel but also serves as a deeply moving ode to the immigrant experience in America. Sohn's autobiographical details, woven into the narrative, make “Elemental” undeniably Pixar-y. ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie': Nostalgic Faithfulness Breaking box-office records, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” stood out for its faithful adaptation of the beloved video game characters. While Chris Pratt's casting as Mario raised eyebrows, the film's commitment to delivering what fans wanted paid off. The vibrant animation by Illumination brought Mario's world to life, with the narrative focusing on rescuing Luigi from the clutches of Bowser. Despite initial skepticism, the movie's success lies in its nostalgic delight and commitment to staying true to the source material. ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem': A Teenage Renaissance Director Jeff Rowe breathed new life into the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” franchise with “Mutant Mayhem.” Setting it apart from previous iterations, Rowe hired actual teenagers to voice the characters, embracing the teenage essence of the title. The film's visual style, resembling doodles from a teenager's school notebook, and the jangly score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross contributed to its charm. “Mutant Mayhem” not only dazzled with its animation but also became one of the most emotionally involving entries in the TMNT legacy. ‘The Boy and The Heron': Miyazaki's Dreamlike Odyssey Hayao Miyazaki returned with “The Boy and The Heron,” a dreamlike tale that unfolded with visual splendor and subtle storytelling. Exploring themes of loss, family, and the mystical, the film showcased Miyazaki's mastery. The non-traditional story structure, coupled with breathtaking visuals, created an enchanting narrative. Robert Pattinson's near-unrecognizable voice acting added to the film's allure, marking a powerful and thought-provoking addition to Miyazaki's illustrious filmography. ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse': Sequel Triumph The sequel to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” exceeded expectations with groundbreaking animation and an emotionally charged storyline. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” continued Miles Morales' journey as he encountered more Spider-people and grappled with the burdens of being a hero. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, along with writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, crafted a sequel that raised the bar for storytelling and animation in the superhero genre. The detailed and eye-popping parallel worlds, coupled with a melancholic tone, left audiences enthralled. While many can argue it wasn't the best-animated movie of 2023, their points might not hold much weight to many who disagree with that stance. In summary, 2023 showcased the versatility and brilliance of animated cinema. From the heartfelt narratives of Pixar to the nostalgic adventures of Mario and the revitalization of iconic franchises like TMNT, each film left an indelible mark on the year, reaffirming animation's power to captivate audiences of all ages. As we look ahead, the legacy of these animated masterpieces will undoubtedly continue to influence and inspire future generations of storytellers.",
