    "text": "The beautiful weather rolls on; some storm chances return next week Below-normal temperatures continue for another couple days QUAD CITIES, IA./Ill. (KWQC) -- It’s another beautiful day across the QCA. Sunshine and a few passing clouds highlight our weather for the remainder of today; clear skies will prevail through tonight. Lows will dip down again into the low 50s and even some 40s across the region. The low humidity continues into the end of our work week. Sun and clouds mixed with highs in the upper 70s and some low 80s to the south can be expected. Looking ahead to the weekend, we add a touch more humidity and some more cloud cover to our weather picture. While we should remain dry, we will be dealing with more of a partly cloudy sky, especially on Sunday. Next week, we will add some rain and storm chances into our forecast. These storm chances should be fairly minimal and widely scattered at best. Temps will approach the mid-80s, which is our average for this time of year. In the long-range, the trend will be slightly warmer than average as we head towards the end of the month into the start of August. TONIGHT: Clear. Low: 57°. Winds: Light and variable. TOMORROWT: Mostly sunny to partly cloudy. High: 80°. Winds: SE 5-10 mph. SATURDAY: Mostly sunny to partly cloudy. High: 82º. Copyright 2024 KWQC. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "World's biggest iceberg completes a perfect pirouette! Watch as a trillion-tonne 'megaberg' the size of Greater London spins on the spot just north of the Antarctic Peninsula - WhatsNew2Day",
    "text": "It is a floating mass of pure white ice, about the size of Greater London. And now the world’s largest iceberg, named A23a, has completed a pirouette during its journey towards the Southern Ocean. NASA satellite images show the tooth-shaped iceberg rotating more than 360 degrees between December and February, just north of the Antarctic Peninsula. A23a is gradually being eroded by waves and melting by warmer waters as it moves north, after 30 years of being anchored to the ocean floor. According to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which visited A23a in December, the iceberg is traveling north at a rate of about 30 miles per day. The world’s largest iceberg, called A23a, has performed a pirouette during its journey towards the Southern Ocean Scientists revealed in November that the iceberg is on the move again. This map shows the iceberg’s position highlighted in blue starting in August (below) and in recent weeks (above). Carried by winds and ocean currents, it is being carried down “iceberg alley,” a common route for icebergs to float toward the subantarctic island of South Georgia. “Megaberg #A23a is in its spin era,” said the British Antarctic Survey, which posted the animation on X (formerly Twitter). ‘These dance moves by #IcebergAlley are part of the iceberg’s long, melting journey to warmer waters. ‘Don’t be fooled by the size of your screen – this is the largest iceberg in the world, about the size of Cornwall or Rhode Island!’ EYOS Expeditions, which arrived at A23a in January, deployed a drone to take the final photographs from the air. EYOS cameraman Richard Sidey said the A23a is “incredibly large” and “stretches as far as you can see in both directions”. ‘Actually, I don’t think we can understand how big it is; We can only know its size through science,” he stated. A23a is the largest surviving fragment of an iceberg that broke off from Antarctica’s Filchner Ice Shelf in August 1986. EYOS cameraman Richard Sidey said the A23a is “incredibly large” and “stretches as far as you can see in both directions”. This shot highlights the loss of a chunk of iceberg mass. It is four times the size of Greater London but getting smaller EYOS Expeditions, which arrived at A23a in January, deployed a drone to take the final photographs from the air. It had only moved a couple hundred miles when it became stuck, or “grounded,” on the bottom of the ocean, and ended up stuck for the next 30 years. Icebergs “sink” to the ocean floor when their keel (the part below the water’s surface) is deeper than the depth of the water. Scientists revealed in November that the iceberg is on the move again, being blown north by wind and ocean currents. They estimated that it has an area of 1,500 square miles, a volume of 263 cubic miles, and a mass of just under a trillion tons. That makes it not only four times larger than Greater London, but also 100 million times heavier than the Eiffel Tower in Paris. However, parts of the iceberg are breaking off as it moves north, due to erosion and melting warmer waters. Like coastal erosion of the land, waves crash against the iceberg to make the gaps constantly grow until the top collapses. This leaves small “piles” that then form smaller “stumps” before melting completely. While A23a originally broke off from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, it remained stranded on the seafloor until last month. To give an idea of scale, this image shows the iceberg area overlaid on a map of Greater London. This is a fusion process by which A23a will eventually be lost forever, but due to its large size, this may take a while. If it doesn’t melt enough by the time it reaches South Georgia (the island in the South Atlantic), it could cause problems. There is a chance that the huge iceberg could disrupt the feeding routines of wild animals like penguins, for example, if it parks in an area where they normally forage. “It depends on its trajectory, but there is a chance it could affect wildlife if it approaches any of the sub-Antarctic islands,” a BAS spokesperson told MailOnline. A23a is currently the largest iceberg in the world, but this title will not last forever because all icebergs eventually break up. The previous record holder was A76, which broke off from an ice shelf in the Weddell Sea in May 2021, but has since broken up into three pieces. Incredible moment when an iceberg breaks and flips next to daring tourists Stunning images captured the moment a gigantic iceberg collapsed and capsized just meters from the daring tourists. Stuck off the coast of Svalbard, Norway, the massive chunk rolled in an extremely rare flipping event as onlookers watched in disbelief. Icebergs are prone to capsize as they separate from their “parent glacier,” and their irregular shapes often cause them to wobble a lot. Scientists say the simple impact of this can release as much energy as an atomic bomb and even cause tsunamis in the most extreme cases. Read more",

    "title": "New York governor pushes for tax increase after nixing toll program in Manhattan",
    "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. — On Wednesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul enraged environmentalists and public transit advocates — but delighted suburban commuters — by putting the brakes on a plan to battle New York City's traffic by imposing high tolls on Manhattan drivers.\nOn Thursday, she was scrambling to get support for her proposal to hike a business tax as a way of replacing the $1 billion per year the tolls had been expected to raise for New York's ailing subway system.\nThe governor's behind-the-scenes effort to get legislative approval for the tax hike came a day after she unexpectedly upended the ''congestion pricing'' toll, a program that was in the works for years and had been scheduled to launch June 30.\nThe Legislature, which is expected to wrap up its annual legislative session on Friday, would have to approve the tax increase on city businesses, known as a payroll mobility tax.\nIt did not appear to have much support.\n''To tell New Yorkers that you care about the cost of living and then to propose a raise on their taxes, to me, is incomprehensible. It does not make sense,'' said Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat.\nAvi Small, a spokesman for Hochul, declined Thursday to provide details on the governor's proposed tax increase and instead referred a reporter to comments Hochul made a day earlier in a pre-recorded video announcing the indefinite pause of congestion pricing.\n\"We have set aside funding to backstop the MTA capital plan, and are currently exploring other funding sources,\" Hochul said Wednesday, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the entity that controls the subway, bus and commuter rail systems that serve the city.\nCongestion pricing was signed into law by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019 after years of advocacy from public transit advocates.\nIn her pre-recorded statement, the governor said she was blocking the plan because of its financial burden on residents dealing with inflation and high costs of living. She also cited the city's fragile economic position as it continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDrivers entering Manhattan south of 60th Street would have had to pay tolls of around $15, depending on vehicle type, on top of tolls for entering the same area via certain bridges and tunnels.\nSen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat who chairs a legislative finance committee, noted that the proposed business tax would eventually be passed down to workers and said she does not think her chamber would support such a proposal.\n''Remember, payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on the workers. It's not a corporate tax, it's a tax on the workers,'' said Kruger, adding ''I believe the governor did misjudge this.''\nThe New York City Independent Budget Office said the tolls had been expected to yield $400 million this year and then $1 billion annually. Toll revenues were set to finance $15 billion in capital projects for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs a vast transportation network in the city and throughout big chunks of the state.\nThe MTA has already allocated more than $400 million for infrastructure to implement congestion pricing, according to the budget office, and has a contract worth more than $500 million with a private vendor tasked with operating and maintaining the tolling infrastructure.\nBefore the abrupt reversal, Hochul had been an avid supporter of congestion pricing and had touted the program as recently as two weeks ago. Heavy pushback began to mount as the start date neared, with harsh criticism coming from the city's suburban commuters.",

President [William Ruto](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/dp-william-ruto-news/) has appointed a new chief of Defence Forces barely two weeks after the death of General Francis Ogolla in a helicopter crash. William Ruto appoints Charles Kahariri Chief of Defence Forces Ogolla died along with nine other [Kenya Defence Forces](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/kdf-news/) (KDF) officers when their helicopter crashed at the border of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Immediately after his death, former military boss, retired General Daudi Tonje, said Ogolla's deputy, Lieutenant General Charles Muriu Kahariri, automatically assumed the CDF's powers in an acting capacity. Ruto, Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces, [appointed Kahariri](https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/546906-william-ruto-appoints-general-charles-muriu-kahariri-chief-defence-forces/) as the new substantive CDF to ensure seamless military operations. Who is a three-star general? Since Kahariri was a Lieutenant General, also known as a three-star general, Ruto promoted him to General (a four-star general) first and then appointed him CDF. Kenya can only have one four-star general at a time. This is the highest military rank a KDF officer can attain. Since his appointment, many Kenyans have been interested in knowing about his military career journey. When did General Charles Kahariri join KDF? TUKO.co.ke established that Kahariri enlisted in Kenya Defence Forces on April 3, 1987. On April 15, 1988, Kahariri was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant officer, underwent additional training in the United Kingdom, and served in various capacities on board ships in the Kenya Navy Fleet. According to the [Ministry of Defence](https://mod.go.ke/lieutenant-general-charles-kahariri-vice-chief-of-defence-forces/), the general has trailed an illustrious career over the three decades he has served in the military, holding several command and management positions. Charles Kahariri career in Kenya Navy Kahariri served as the commanding officer of Kenya Navy Ships, Mamba, Madaraka, and Umoja before becoming the commanding officer of the Kenya Navy's Manda base. He went ahead to serve as the Squadron Commander of the Kenya Navy fleet and the deputy commander of the Kenya Navy, a service unit of the KDF. The new CDF was elevated to serve as senior directing staff of the Kenya Navy at the National Defence College and then proceeded to be a deputy commandant of the military. General Charles Kahariri's role in Somalia Kahariri served as the Maritime Component Commander for Operation Linda Nchi, (Operation Protect the Country), during which Kenya's military entered Somalia in 2011. According to the KDF, Kahariri was the Task Force Commander for “Operation Sledge Hammer” during Kenya's military capture of Kismayu. Kahariri represented Kenya as the National Focal Person for the Contact Group on Piracy Off the Coast of Somalia and the Djibouti Code of Conduct. He also served on the National Task Forces for the Delimitation of Kenya’s Exclusive Economic Zones and Delimitation of Kenya’s Extended Continental Shelf. Charles Kahariri's military credentials Kahariri has numerous local and international training credentials under his belt. To build his capacity and enhance his military and leadership skills, Kahariri studied the International Midshipman Course in the UK, the Long Navigation Course in India, a Management and Strategic Planning Course, the Naval Command Course in the USA, the Senior Strategic Leadership Leadership Course in the UK, and the Joint Campaign Planning, Flag Level Combined Maritime Component Command Course in Italy. Kahariri also studied an Executive Development Course at the University of North Carolina, USA, and holds a Diploma in Strategic and [Security](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/kenya-security/) Studies from the United States Naval War College. Charles Kaharirir's honours, awards and family The new Kenya military general is a laureate of honours and awards, with Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (CBS) being his most recent accolade. His other honours are the Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (C.B.S.) and [Naval War College \"nwc'](https://usnwc.edu/) (USA). Kahariri is married and has three children and one grandson. Kahariri was [appointed the Vice Chief of the Defence Forces](https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/540752-william-ruto-appoints-david-kimaiyo-kenya-army-commander-kahariri-francis-ogollas-vice/), Kenya Defence Forces, on March 9, 2024. This means he served 55 days as Kenya's Vice Chief of Defence Forces. He took over from Lieutenant General John Maina Mwangi, who had completed his tenure.

    "title": "Rain boosts lamb prices in NSW",
    "text": "Rain during the first few days of 2024 has put a bounce in the step of the lamb market in the state's south. The optimistic mood sparked vigorous bidding at Wagga Wagga's prime lamb sale on Thursday from eager buyers vying for a stake in a more limited offering. A total of 19,000 lambs were offered which was about 31,000 head fewer than the last sale of 2023 in mid December. Despite the fact that not all major export or domestic processors were operational, Meat and Livestock Australia reported the market recorded a significant upswing of as much as $40 a head. \"The dynamic market conditions are shaping the pricing landscape leading into the new year,\" MLA reported. Prices lifted $25 to $40 on the well-finished, not-shorn lambs that commanded the premium rates. \"Trade lambs peaked at $194, while the heavier trade lambs in the 24 to 26 kilogram range fetched prices of $216, with an average of 830 cents a kilogram (carcase weight),\" MLA reported. Lambs in the 26kg to 30kg category were sold within the range of $216 to $244, and those heavier than 30kg reached a peak at $255. Light lambs also took the spotlight, with prices spanning from $108 to $145. Meanwhile, at Yass prime lamb sale a day earlier the overall market trend was $20 to $30 dearer. The first sale of the year at that centre produced a limited yarding of 3900 good quality lambs. MLA said there were limited numbers offered for restockers and not all the usual buyers were present. New season trade lambs weighing 18kg to 24kg sold from $131 to $149 and trade weight old lambs sold from $115 to $152. Heavy weight new season lambs weighing more than 24kg sold from $161 to $185 and heavy old lambs topped at $227. Light lambs less than 18kg to the processors sold from $67 to $134. The few pens of lambs to the restockers sold from $44 to $105 and hoggets sold from $87 to $133. ",
