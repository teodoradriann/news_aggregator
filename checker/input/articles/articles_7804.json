    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Kajol's Sister Tanishaa Says Women Should Stay Home To Bring Up Their Kids; Confesses She Had A Lonely Childhood\nTanishaa Mukerji Sparks Debate With Her Views on Working Mothers: “Women Should Stay Home to Raise Kids”\nMumbai: Actress Tanishaa Mukerji, daughter of veteran actress Tanuja and sister to Bollywood star Kajol, has stirred up a conversation with her recent remarks on motherhood. In a candid interview, Tanishaa shared her perspective on why she believes mothers should stay at home to raise their children, drawing from her own childhood experiences.\nReflecting on her upbringing, Tanishaa revealed that she often felt alone as a child due to her mother’s busy work schedule. “I would say my mom was a working woman, but I wish she wasn’t. When I was born, my mother had to work to support our family. We didn’t have enough money then. My mom used to work at least two to three shifts every day. I would never meet my mother, but I would still sleep in her room to feel closer to her,” she shared to Hautterfly.\nHer confession highlighted the emotional void she felt growing up, which has influenced her strong opinions on parenting today.\nTanishaa firmly believes that a child’s early years require a mother’s presence more than anything else. She expressed that no school, nanny, or caretaker can substitute a mother’s love and nurturing.\n“I just feel that women should be home with their children because only a mother can really teach the child, bring up the child, and give the child the nurturing they need. You can’t get this from your school, or nanny, or maid. I am not very big on ‘leave your child and go to work,’” she said.\nThe actress further urged mothers to dedicate the first five years of their child’s life solely to parenting, believing that it forms the foundation of a strong emotional bond.\n“I strongly feel that if you want to have a child, give that child the first five years of your life. Then do whatever you want,” she added.\nEven as an adult, Tanishaa admitted that she still holds on tightly to her mother, Tanuja, a feeling rooted in the emotional absence she experienced growing up. “I am very clingy with my mom. It is because of the feeling of being left, so whenever I had her around me, I wouldn’t leave her alone. I still cling to my mummy,” she confessed.\nTanishaa’s comments have sparked a debate online, with some agreeing with her traditional perspective on motherhood and parenting, while others argue that working mothers can also provide love and nurturing.\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news and world News on Zee News.\nLive Tv",

    "text": "By Will Thomas ,\n2 hours ago The black and white paint of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse can be seen from miles on land and sea but not right now. The structure has been stripped of its paint and is surrounded by scaffolding, all part of an almost $20 million multi-year restoration project that began in September 2023.\n“We started removing all of the beautiful, beautiful paint on the interior and exterior of the lighthouse so we can start doing some brick and metal assessments on the structure, so that way we know our path forward and how to restore the lighthouse,\" said Lindsey Gravel, project manager with Stone and Lime Historic Restoration Services.\nRight now, the focus is assessing the brick and metal of the structure inside and out. That includes a mix of repairing and replacing it.\nWatch: Visitors spy scaffolding during $19 million Cape Hatteras Lighthouse restoration\nCape Hatteras Lighthouse surrounded by scaffolding as restoration work continues \"There's going to be a lot of new brick going in, we're going to try to preserve as much as we can. The brick seems to be in pretty great condition, so we might not have to replace as much as we expected, but there's still some assessments to do, same thing with the metals. The metals could go both ways. Those have to be repaired in place as well. So as far as the restoration goes, we're repainting about 20% of the tower and on the base as well,\" said Gravel.\nOnce these assessments are completed, the hope is to start getting the paint back on the lighthouse by the spring of 2025. Visitors most likely won't see a whole lot of change before then, as much of the work is atop the lighthouse and inside of it.\nAnother focus at the moment is finalizing the plan for putting 11 new windows in place. Though modernizing the lighthouse is a part of this process, the key is preservation.\nWatch: Cape Hatteras Lighthouse being restored during massive renovation project\nCape Hatteras Lighthouse being restored during massive renovation project “These brand-new windows, they need to meet structural and impact resistance according to the code, but historic windows will never meet the structural requirements of modern day. What we're doing is we're trying to figure out some path forward on how to meet in the middle so they can look as historic as possible, because that's really important in preservation, to give it the ornate and original feel.”\nProgress is being made on the project, some that can be seen are the new and widened walkways work for a better visitor experience, work on restoring the Oil House and the installation of a replica of the Fresnel Lens that will be installed atop the lighthouse, similar to the original light, with an LED bulb.\nWatch: Brand new 'shell-ebrities' at seashore excavation in Cape Hatteras\nBrand new 'shell-ebrities' at Friday's seashore excavation in Cape Hatteras The main aspects of this restoration project from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore's press release are below:\nRehabilitate the interior and restore the exterior of the lighthouse. Repaint the interior and exterior of the lighthouse. Restore important architectural components, including missing pediments over the lighthouse windows and missing interior doors. Repair and repoint masonry, remove corrosion and repair metal elements. Remove the metal weight track from the lighthouse. Install new railing using a non-corrosive metal on the lantern balcony. Remove existing rotating light beacon and metal platform from the lantern and replace with a replica of the original first-order Fresnel lens. The replica lens will be the same size and overall appearance as the original, but LED lights will be used inside the lens. Rehabilitate and repair the Oil House. Remove the existing vinyl perimeter fence around the lighthouse and replace with a replica of the original (pre-1920) decorative metal octagonal fence with granite bases. Fabricate and install a replica stockade fence around both the Principal Keeper’s Quarters and Double Keepers’ Quarters (Museum of the Sea) to match the look and feel of the original landscape of the early historic period (1870-1890s). Create a new walkway from the parking lot to improve pedestrian circulation, wayfinding, interpretation and the visitor experience. Relocate the Keepers of the Light Amphitheater stones to provide interpretation of the lighthouse keeper’s role.

Elle a aussi été suspendue par Soccer Canada. Andy Spence prendra sa place pour le reste de la compétition. Cette décision survient dans la foulée de la saga d'espionnage au drone, en marge de la rencontre de phase de groupes qui a été disputé en matinée contre la Nouvelle-Zélande. Déjà, plus tôt cette semaine, l'instructrice adjointe Jasmine Mander et l'analyste Joseph Lombardi avaient été renvoyés au Canada, [après que Lombardi eut été aperçu en train de manipuler un drone durant une séance d'entraînement néo-zélandaise qui aurait dû être privée](https://www.rds.ca/jeux-olympiques/jeux-olympiques-de-paris-2024-un-canadien-intercepte-pour-espionnage-a-paris-1.19339559). « Au cours des 24 dernières heures, plus d'informations nous ont été mentionnées concernant d'anciens évènements d'espionnage en marge des Olympiques de Paris 2024. À la lumière de ces récentes nouvelles, Soccer Canada a décidé de suspendre Bev Priestman pour le reste des Jeux olympiques de Paris et jusqu'à la fin de notre enquête indépendante annoncée récemment », a indiqué le COC dans le communiqué.

    "text": "What was meant to be a memorable weekend backpacking trip in the Sierra ended in heartbreak for a Prather family.\nA beloved father, grandfather, husband, and outdoorsman, Robert “Bob” Gretsch, never made it back from the trail.\nGretsch, 68, was hiking the Cliff Lake Trail near Courtright Reservoir with his son and grandson when he became separated from the group Sunday evening.\nHis family says Bob was an experienced hiker, well-prepared and familiar with the area, so at first, they weren’t concerned.\n“He said, ‘Give me a minute, I’ll catch up,’” said his son Robert. “So we kept going back toward the truck, thinking he’d meet us there.”\nWhen he didn’t show, the family returned to search but still couldn’t find him.\nSearch and rescue teams were called in, and by Monday morning, it was another hiker who found Bob’s body. A helicopter was dispatched to recover him.\nAccording to deputies, there were no visible injuries, his family believes he suffered a sudden cardiac episode.\nAlthough Bob had beaten prostate cancer a few years ago, his family says he’d been healthy and active ever since.\n“We did everything together,” said Robert. “We had just gotten back from deep sea fishing in Monterey and Santa Cruz. He loved being out there.”\nWhether it was skiing black diamond slopes, fishing, or backpacking, Bob lived for adventure and spent much of it alongside his grandchildren. His grandson Reece shared some of the lessons passed down from their outdoor trips.\n“Don’t tie a bad knot,” Reece recalled with a smile. “If you do, your whole line can fall apart, especially if you hook a big one.”\nBob started both of his grandchildren skiing before their first birthdays, and he spent years teaching them the skills he loved.\nHe also worked for Fish and Game, served on the ski patrol at China Peak, and even taught tree felling with Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service.\n“He did it all,” Robert said. “And he made us who we are.”\nWhile Bob’s sudden passing has left a deep void in the family, they say they take comfort knowing he died doing what he loved—surrounded by nature, with the people he loved most by his side.\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help his wife with final expenses, as Bob did not have life insurance.\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/bobs-sudden-passing-support-needed",

    "title": "At Last, a Nasal Epinephrine Spray",
    "text": "At Last, a Nasal Epinephrine Spray This summer, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-tracked approval of the [first-in-its-class nasal epinephrine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-nasal-spray-treatment-anaphylaxis) (neffy). It’s a very welcome addition to our [anaphylaxis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/135065-overview) treatment armamentarium. In healthy volunteers, neffy achieved similar serum epinephrine levels, rises in blood pressure, and pulse compared with IM epinephrine. The Need for Neffy It was just a few days ago that I saw a new patient with fire ant anaphylaxis. The last time he tried to use an injectable epinephrine pen, he made two mistakes. First, he placed the wrong end against his thigh, and when it did not inject, he depressed it with his thumb — in other words, he injected his thumb with epinephrine. Of course, that cannot happen with neffy. I recall a few years ago, a child experienced anaphylaxis but the parent was hesitant to administer the EAI (epinephrine autoinjector). The parent drove to the emergency room but was delayed by traffic, and by the time they reached the ER, the patient had suffered a respiratory arrest and passed away. Patients are not the only ones who are hesitant to administer epinephrine. Some clinicians do not treat anaphylaxis appropriately. As an allergist, I see patients after-the-fact for diagnosis and management. Patients often tell me of systemic allergic reactions treated with IV antihistamines/corticosteroids and even sometimes with nebulized beta agonists, but not epinephrine. My opinion is that it’s not just needle [phobia](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/290854-overview). As I mentioned, in my Medscape commentary [“Injectable Epinephrine: An Epidemic of Misuse,”](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/838198) I believe it’s due to a misunderstanding of the guidelines and a sense that epinephrine is a potent medication to be used sparingly. Clinicians and patients must understand that epinephrine is a naturally occurring hormone and administration leads to serum levels seen under other natural circumstances (eg, stress — the fight-or-flight surge). The aforementioned article also includes a patient handout, “Don’t Fear Epinephrine,” which I encourage you to read and distribute. The potential benefits of neffy are clear: - It should overcome fear of injection ergo being more likely to be used, and used earlier, by both patient/family member and clinicians. - It’s easier to carry than many larger devices (though not the AUVI-Q). - It cannot be injected incorrectly. - Expiration is 8 months longer than the EAI. - There are no pharmacist substitutions (as there is no equivalent device). Potential Problems With Neffy and Some Suggested Solutions As promising and beneficial as it is, I wonder about a few training issues. In the office, patients can be trained with a (reusable) injectable epinephrine trainer but not with a nasal spray device trainer in the office (an important alternative is a small model of a nose in the office for patient education). A training device should also be included in the neffy prescription, as with the EAI.",

    "text": "Voluntários participam da maior faxina da história do Rio Grande do Sul em Porto Alegre Em um dos bairros mais afetados da cidade, cerca de 60 pessoas ajudaram na limpeza das casas A maior faxina da história do Rio Grande do Sul começou neste sábado (22). Em um dos bairros mais afetados de Porto Alegre, cerca de 60 voluntários ajudaram na limpeza das casas. “A ideia do Reconstrução RS seria mediante ao apoio que a gente tá buscando para fazer pequenos reparos de construção, além da limpeza, pintura, elétrica, hidráulica. A gente precisa muito de apoio para continuar o projeto”, diz Tiago Silva, coordenador do Reconstrução RS. A dona Romilda Ribeiro foi uma das beneficiadas. A idosa de 77 anos conta que tem dificuldade de locomoção. “Eu não tenho equilíbrio, porque tenho que andar com essa bengala, senão eu posso cair... Não posso fazer faxina”, revela. Faz duas semanas que a família do Herlon Duarte tenta voltar para casa. O motorista recebeu doações, mas ainda faltavam braços para ajudar. “Vai dar uma força enorme, porque nós temos que trabalhar e não temos tempo para fazer a limpeza. Com essa ajuda, vai avançar bastante”, celebra. Em um mês, 180 voluntários estiveram em cerca de 70 endereços. Somente na Zona Norte de Porto Alegre, dezenas de famílias já foram atendidas pelo projeto. A Tainara Pimentel é uma das voluntárias. “Sozinhos a gente não ia conseguir, então quanto mais voluntários, mais famílias a gente ajuda. Precisamos muito de ajuda, porque os móveis são pesados, colchão molha…”, revela. Mais de 400 famílias se cadastraram para receber ajuda, mas para aumentar a corrente de solidariedade, é preciso de ainda mais voluntários. Para entrar em contato, basta acessar as redes sociais pelo @reconstrução.rs.",
