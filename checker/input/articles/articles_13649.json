    "title": "Carlson: 2016 Arbitral Award not just a milestone for Philippines, but entire Indo-Pacific region",
    "text": "United States Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson highlighted the enduring significance of the 2016 Arbitral Award, not only for Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea, but the entire stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region.\nCarlson issued the statement at a Stratbase forum on Friday to mark the 8 th anniversary of the ruling. In her remarks, she reinforced the US government’s support for the Philippines and underscored the critical role of international law in ensuring regional stability and freedom of navigation.\nShe emphasized that the July 12, 2016, arbitral ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands is not merely a legal milestone for the Philippines but a landmark decision for the entire Indo-Pacific region.\nThe ruling, which overwhelmingly favored the Philippines, clarified the country’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf. This legal foundation is crucial in asserting the Philippines’ maritime entitlements against China’s expansive claims.\n“We are proud to be among the chorus of nations that have consistently lent their voices to calling out incidents or aggression. The volume of condemnation from the international community is loud and getting louder, and it speaks to our common resolve in support of the international rules and norms that benefit us all,” Carlson stated.\nHighlighting the economic significance of the issue, Carlson pointed out that the South China Sea is one of the busiest shipping lanes globally, facilitating over $3 trillion in annual trade. It is also home to rich biodiversity and accounts for 12% of the global fish catch, supporting millions of livelihoods.\nThe legal clarity provided by the arbitral ruling underpins the economic activities that thrive in the region, benefitting both the Philippines and the broader international community.\nCalrson also announced the Luzon Economic Corridor, a key initiative from the Trilateral Leaders’ Summit between US President Joe Biden, Philippine President Marcos, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nThis corridor aims to boost infrastructure development in the Philippines, focusing on port, rail, and digital infrastructure, further enhancing the economic benefits derived from the region’s stability.\n“As we have often heard President Marcos say, economic security is national security. For the past eight years, the Arbitral award has been a lynchpin in the Philippines’ national security vision for a peaceful and prosperous archipelagic nation – one that the United States steadfastly supports,” Carlson said.\nShe talked about the deepening economic ties between the US and the Philippines, noting that the Washington remains Manila’s largest export market.\nRecent engagements, such as the sixth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila, have launched $20 million in new US economic programs and celebrated over $5 billion in new investments, emphasizing America’s commitment to supporting the Philippines’ economic growth.\nOn the defense front, Carlson underscored the importance of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which has seen $120 million in investments to bolster the Philippines’ disaster response and critical infrastructure.\nThis agreement facilitates closer training and modernization efforts between Filipino and American forces, reinforcing the Philippines’ national security.\nThe ambassador also highlighted recent multilateral maritime cooperation involving the United States, Philippines, Japan, Australia, Canada, and France. These activities showcase a united front in upholding international maritime laws and ensuring freedom of navigation.\nReaffirming the US’ stance, Carlson called on China to cease its aggressive actions in the region. She condemned the harassment of Philippine vessels operating lawfully within the Philippines’ EEZ and urged China to respect the 2016 arbitral ruling. Secretary of State Blinken, in a statement on the same day, reiterated this call, emphasizing the importance of abiding by international law.\n“We applaud President Marcos and the Government of the Philippines for defending the well-being of its service members on the BRP Sierra Madre,” said Carlson.\nThe US ambassador said she will be meeting with Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command Chief Rear Admiral Alfonso Torres, Jr. and the ship’s crew via video conference “to thank them for the important role they play in defending Philippine rights – and by extension, the rights of all of us – under international law.”",

    "title": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash | KMUW",
    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "title": "¿Por qué Rusia no participa en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?",
    "text": "(CNN) -- El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) decidió en octumbre de 2023 suspender la participación en los Juegos Olímpicos de París que están a punto de comenzar al Comité Olímpico Ruso, lo que implicó la pérdida de financiamiento y el hecho de que el COI se reserva el derecho de decidir sobre la participación de atletas con pasaporte ruso en tanto deportistas neutrales.\n¿Por qué el Comité Olímpico Internacional suspendió a Rusia?\nTras la invasión rusa de Ucrania —apoyada por Belarús— en febrero de 2022, el COI recomendó que se prohibiera a los atletas rusos y bielorrusos competir en eventos deportivos internacionales. En enero de 2023, el COI anunció su intención de permitir que estos atletas compitan como neutrales, de forma similar a cómo se presentan los tenistas rusos y bielorrusos en otros eventos deportivos como ATP, WTA y Grand Slam, sin ninguna referencia a su nacionalidad.\nLuego, sin embargo, el COI suspendió por completo al Comité Olímpico Ruso en octubre de 2023, debido a que Rusia había absorvido a las organizaciones deportivas regionales ucranianas en Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia.\nCalendario de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024: horarios, competiciones y fechas\n\"La decisión unilateral adoptada por el Comité Olímpico Ruso el 5 de octubre de 2023 de incluir entre sus miembros a las organizaciones deportivas regionales que están bajo la autoridad del Comité Olímpico Nacional (CON) de Ucrania (a saber, Donetsk, Jersón, Luhansk y Zaporiyia) constituye una violación de la Carta Olímpica porque viola la integridad territorial del CON de Ucrania, reconocida por el COI de conformidad con la Carta Olímpica\", afirma el COI sobre el episodio de octubre.\nPese a esa dura decisión, la comisión ejecutiva del COI dictaminó que sería injusto castigar a los atletas basándose únicamente en sus pasaportes, lo que abrió la posibilidad de permitir que algunos compitan en París, aunque bajo condiciones muy estrictas.\nMariya Lasitskene, del Comité Olímpico de Rusia, ganó la medalla de oro en salto de altura femenino en los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio. (Noticias de Kyodo/Getty Images)\n\"Sin bandera, himno, ni colores\"\nUn \"Atleta Neutral Individual\" es el nombre utilizado para referirse a los atletas con pasaporte ruso o bielorruso que competirán en los juegos de este año. Se hace referencia a estos atletas con la abreviatura AIN, que proviene de la traducción francesa Athlètes Individuels Neutres.\n¿Qué significa AIN en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024?\nA estos atletas se les permitirá competir siempre y cuando cumplan con los requisitos de elegibilidad.\n\"Las sanciones contra los responsables de la guerra, los Estados y gobiernos de Rusia y Belarús, siguen vigentes para los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024\", afirmó el COI en un comunicado.\n\"No se exhibirá ninguna bandera, ni se cantará el himno, ni se mostrarán colores ni ninguna otra identificación de Rusia o Belarús en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024, en ninguna sede oficial ni en ninguna función oficial\", continúa el comunicado.\nLa vestimenta de competición de los AIN aún no ha sido revelada, por lo que no está claro si llevarán los colores turquesa de la flamante bandera de los AIN, o si vestirán ropa deportiva básica. También se ha encargado un himno, sin letra, para su uso en ceremonias de entrega de medallas.\nAunque los AIN son elegibles para competir y ganar medallas olímpicas, no figurarán en el medallero de las naciones.\nLos AIN también serán excluidos del desfile de delegaciones en la Ceremonia de Apertura por ser atletas individuales y no un equipo, aunque el COI ha dicho que \"se les brindará la oportunidad de vivir el evento\".\nLa versión final de la bandera de AIN asignada por el COI el 19 de marzo. (COI)\nCuáles son los requisitos para competir como AIN\nEn diciembre de 2023, la Junta Ejecutiva del COI decidió que los atletas rusos y bielorrusos que se clasificaron a través de los sistemas de clasificación existentes de las federaciones internacionales tendrían que cumplir requisitos estrictos para ser seleccionados como AIN.\nNo habrá representación rusa ni bielorrusa en las pruebas por equipos y la participación se limitará a la competencia individual.\nSegún el COI, los atletas que apoyen activamente la guerra o que estén contratados por el ejército o las agencias de seguridad nacional rusas o bielorrusas no serán elegibles para inscribirse ni competir. La misma estipulación se aplica al personal de soporte.\nComo todos los demás atletas, los AIN deberán cumplir requisitos antidopaje para ser considerados para la selección.\nLa elegibilidad de estos atletas será determinada por el recientemente establecido Panel de Revisión de Elegibilidad de Atletas Neutrales Individuales.\nEn los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio 2020 (aplazados hasta 2021 debido a la pandemia de covid-19) y en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de 2022 en Beijing, los atletas rusos compitieron bajo el nombre del Comité Olímpico Ruso (ROC) como resultado de un dopaje patrocinado por el Estado.\nCuántos AIN competirán en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024\nEl COI afirmó que, hasta el 28 de marzo, 12 AIN con pasaporte ruso y siete AIN con pasaporte bielorruso se habían clasificado para París 2024. \"El número máximo, que es poco probable que se alcance, sería 55 y 28 respectivamente\", dijo el COI a CNN.\nEn comparación, Rusia envió 330 atletas a Tokio en 2021, mientras que Belarús envió 104.\nTambién está la cuestión de si Moscú aceptará realmente las condiciones establecidas por el COI. Es que Rusia planea organizar sus propios \"Juegos de la Amistad\" a finales de este año, un evento que ha sido condenado por el COI.\nLa identidad de los atletas aún no se ha revelado, pero es posible que el exnúmero 1 del mundo, el tenista ruso Daniil Medvedev, forme parte del campo. El excampeón del US Open dijo que estaría feliz de participar como un actor neutral.\n\"Decidí por mí mismo que siempre que pueda participar en los Juegos Olímpicos, quiero estar allí y quiero representar lo que pueda representar\", dijo a los periodistas el mes pasado. \"Si no es bajo la bandera, (igual) sé quién soy, sé por qué juego tenis y jugué así toda mi vida\".\nCon información de Sam Joseph, de CNN\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
