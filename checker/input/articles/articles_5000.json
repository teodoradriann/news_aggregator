    "text": "MT ASHLAND SKI AREA, Ore. – Skiers and boarders across the region took advantage of the snow to enjoy Mt Ashland’s opening day Thursday.\nThere wasn’t enough snow to open during Christmas Break, but this year’s opening day was still extra special as Thursday marks exactly 60 years since the Ski Area first opened.\nMt Ashland general manager Andrew Gast says it’s amazing to be able to celebrate their anniversary exactly to the day.\n“A week and a half ago we had dirt on the ground and now we got feet and feet of snow,” Gast said. “I think that 60 years ago when people first came up with the idea of Mt. Ashland, I don’t know that they saw that the pass what it would become and how popular we are. Opening day we filled the parking lot on a Thursday at 9:30 in the morning.”\nGast says there’s still plenty of time to hit the slopes before the season wraps up in early spring.\nHe says there will be fun events and live music every Saturday until it closes.\nYou can find more information about Mt. Ashland Ski Area and its season\non their website here.\n ",

Para el gremio que nuclea a los maestros públicos de la provincia, el salario que cobra un docente que recién se inicia está más cerca de la línea de indigencia y es por eso que consideraron necesario una política salarial acorde a los números que marca la economía real de los trabajadores.",

    "text": "National-According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cancer is a term used for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can take over other tissues. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. Cancer is not just one disease, but many diseases.\nA person can lower their risk of getting many common kinds of cancer by making healthy choices, keeping a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol intake, and protecting their skin. Screening tests can find some cancers early when treatment works best. Vaccines (shots) can help prevent or reduce your cancer risk (example: HPV, hepatitis).\nHow Does Cancer Affect African American Populations?\nBlack/African Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for all cancers combined and for most major cancers. Death rates for all major causes of death are higher for Black/African Americans than for non-Hispanic whites, contributing in part to a lower life expectancy for both Black/African American men and women.\nFrom 2015-2019, African American men were 1.2 times and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to have new cases of colon and prostate cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nBlack/African American men are 1.8 times as likely to have stomach cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men and 2.5 times more likely to die from stomach cancer.\nBlack/African American men have lower 5-year cancer survival rates for most cancer sites, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nBlack/African American men are twice as likely to die from prostate cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nFrom 2015-2019, Black/African American women were just as likely to have been diagnosed with breast cancer; however, they were almost 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white women.\nBlack/African American women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer, and they are 2.3 times more likely to die from stomach cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white women.",

    "text": "By Cameron Thompson, WTVR CBS 6 Web Staff ,\n4 hours ago RICHMOND, Va. -- A tribute to the past being brought to life in a mural near West Main and South Granby streets in Richmond that will feature Richmonders who've earned the Medal of Honor.\n\"Let's share those infallible values of those actions with a city,\" Ian Berry, the president and founder of Monumental Honor, said. \"We want to honor their legacy, uniting the city and developing the future through the process.\"\nBerry said the idea for the nonprofit began when he was at West Point and learned the story of one man: Lt. Jimmie Monteith, who died helping get soldiers off the beaches of Normandy during D-Day.\n\"Still gives me chills now,\" Berry said. \"He's a Virginia Tech grad, and actually a grad of Thomas Jefferson High School.\"\nBerry said he does not want Monteith's story forgotten or those of the at least nine others from Richmond, including George L. Street, Ernest Dervishian and Powhatan Beaty who will also be featured on the mural.\n\"And developing future generations through STEM innovation and projects and internships along the way,\" Berry said.\nThe mural, which will also include city landmarks, is being installed by renowned-Richmond artist Hamilton Glass.\n\"It's a chance to have a home to really display and amplify their voices,\" said Glass, who completed more than 300 murals around the city. \"It's my belief that public art is kind of like the thermometer of a community. And kind of tell the history, what's going on, what we believe. And can really be like this beacon of light for us.\"\nChris Carlisle, a senior at Benedictine Prep, is shadowing Glass through the CapCity Alpha's Young Achiever's program.\n\"I've seen his art all around Richmond, so seeing that work, being able to be with him in person is really cool,\" Carlisle said. \"He was someone I looked up to.\"\nDavid Baumann, who is a chef at the nearby Skybox, is excited to see the finished work.\n\"Something that's nice giving back to the community, teaching people values of what veterans really are,\" Baumann said. \"I think that's a really positive thing and I'm pretty stoked about that.\"\nBerry said the mural is the just one of several projects the nonprofit hopes to place around the city to honor the recipients of nation's highest award for valor. Scholarships and a memorial walkway are also in the works.\n\"Where you can see the actions and the focus is on the values of their actions and not on the man because man is fallible, but their actions are not,\" Berry said.\nThe mural is expected to be completed by Friday, March 22, which will be in time for the Medal of Honor Day on Monday, March 25.\nDo you know about a good news story happening in your community?

    "text": "Outfielder\nJesse Winker and the New York Mets have agreed on a one-year deal, a source confirmed to ESPN amid multiple reports Thursday.\nWinker, 31, will return to the Mets after the club acquired him in a trade from the\nWashington Nationals at the deadline last summer. The deal is pending Winkler passing a physical, a source told ESPN.\nHe signed a minor-league deal with Washington coming off an injury-plagued 2023 campaign with the\nMilwaukee Brewers. He thrived with the rebuilding Nationals, hitting 11 home runs with a .257/.374/.419 slash line, which made him an attractive trade candidate for contending teams seeking a left-handed bat.\nThe Mets acquired him for right-hander Tyler Stuart, and he batted .243 with three home runs and a .683 OPS in 44 games with New York.\nWith\nJuan Soto and Brandon Nimmo slated to start in the corner outfield spots, Winker figures to spend most of his time as the designated hitter against right-handed pitchers in 2025 with Starling Marte, as it stands, getting DH starts against lefties.\nThe Mets and homegrown star\nPete Alonso, who remains one of the top free agents on the market, still have not been able to come to an agreement despite mutual interest, according to sources. Alonso, a four-time All-Star, was drafted by the Mets in 2016.",
