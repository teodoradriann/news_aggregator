    "title": "How childhood ‘torture’ prepared Dusit D2 saviour Christian Craighead | Nation",
    "text": "When Mr Christian Craighead who is a former member of the United Kingdom’s elite 22 Special Air Service Unit rushed into Dusit D2, located along Riverside Drive, Nairobi County and helped in containing a terror attack that left 21 people dead, he says he was prepared for it. Mr Craighead in an interview with Shwan Ryan Show this week says that he never liked his childhood life and the experience he had while growing up had prepared him for such a moment. The Dusit D2 attack took place on January 15, 2019. During the attack, he was in Kenya to train local forces. He was not anticipating that terrorists were planning to strike. With just an assault rifle, a Glock pistol, a combat knife and his indomitable spirit, he waged a counter-attack against the terrorists. He was dressed in civilian clothing with a camouflage flak jacket and a balaclava. He was captured on television and photos as he assisted Kenyan officers in dealing with the attack. He also assisted people to move to safety. “When I went to Dusit D2 in 2019 when Al Shabaab militants stormed in I was well prepared. My childhood life had prepared me for that moment,” said Mr Craighead. He said that he was not the right man at the right place and that the reality is he “had to be there on that day when the attack took place.” Immediately after his brave show in dealing with the militants, he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. It is worth noting that Craighead joined the Parachute Regiment while he was a teenager and was selected for the Pathfinder Platoon. During his days when he was serving he worked in several deployments which include; Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Craighead who grew up in North East England in the interview said that he would not discuss his career life while he was serving the army but if allowed, in the future he would do so. He gave details of an incident which happened when he was eight years old, and how he was attacked by two older boys just days after they were released from juvenile prison. “The two older boys tortured me for almost two hours and kept assaulting me. They could step on my chest and slap me as they made fun of everything. I am sure that if I was a young girl they could have even raped me,” he said. A man who grew up as an only child said he is the person he is today because of efforts that were made by his grandmother as he grew up. “My mother was single and I never met my father until later in life. Honestly, my grandmother takes full responsibility for the person that I am today,” he said. Mr Craighead said that since his childhood, he wanted to be a soldier noting he lived his dream on the days he served in the army. “Joining the army really saved my life and made me make the right decisions as I grew up,” he said. Currently, there is a gag order which was issued by the British Government that he should not discuss details of the deadly Disit D2 attack. Legal battles have overshadowed his heroic deeds with the last order being made in October 2023, in which he was stopped from releasing a book on how he beat Shabaab militants. He launched a legal challenge against the ban which was imposed by the Secretary of Defence saying such a move was in breach of his freedom of speech. The court stopped him from releasing the book and that it was important because it would be protecting SAS’s tradecraft in the interest of national security. The book entitled One Man In: The Explosive Firsthand Account of the Lone Special-Ops Soldier Who Fought Off a Major Terrorist Attack in Kenya was expected to be published in 2023. Operating under strict rules, special forces are not allowed to discuss their missions in public.",

    "text": "> SEATTLE, Sept 13 — Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike Thursday, spurning a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for manufacturing staff given the company’s stressed financial condition.\nHourly workers rejected the contract with a vote of 94.6 per cent and to strike with 96 per cent, said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.\n“Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” said Holden, who represents about 33,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest. “We strike at midnight.”\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and sideline some 33,000 workers.\nThursday’s vote marks a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, entertainment and other industries.\nLed by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25-per cent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would avert a costly strike as the company struggles to right the ship.\nOrtberg argued in a message to staff that the general wage hike marked the largest in history and that a strike “would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.”\nBut rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement, which was initially backed by IAM leadership.\n‘Hollow’ commitments\nWorkers had sought a 40 per cent wage hike and critics have said the 25 per cent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus.\nOther points of contention include the deal’s failure to restore a pension, as well as a Boeing pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics view as a “hollow” commitment to the region because it offers no promises beyond the four-year contract.\n“They’re talking about a 25 per cent increase and it’s not,” said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike after concluding Boeing’s spin was “misleading.”\nJanousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine per cent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus.\nSome workers also expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure.\n“Striking isn’t ideal, but it’s for the best for your long-term well being,” said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months.\nPhilbin said he will work side jobs if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes.\n“(Boeing) is a huge company, they can survive paying the people who do the work a little more,” he said.\nBig impact from strike?\nThe IAM has a history of striking, with the most recent stoppage in 2008 lasting 57 days.\nHolden has said he initially backed the deal as the best that could be achieved without striking.\nBut the “real power” in the union resides with the workers, according to Holden who said at a press conference that “awesome” wins by other unions had given the IAM “something to aspire to achieve as well.”\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing’s turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.\nHolden said he looked forward to getting back to the bargaining table.\nThursday’s vote “sends a strong message that our members deserve better,” he said. — AFP\n<",
