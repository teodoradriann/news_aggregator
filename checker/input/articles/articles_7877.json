    "text": "PA Media: Sport Teenage sensation Luke Littler defeats Michael Van Gerwen to win Bahrain Masters Read full article PA Sport Staff 19 January 2024 at 10:54 pm · 3-min read\nTeenage sensation Luke Littler powered his way past three-times world champion Michael Van Gerwen to claim his first senior PDC title on a perfect day at the Bahrain Masters.\nThe 16-year-old, who lost to Luke Humphries in the World Darts Championship final earlier this month after a thrilling run which catapulted him into the limelight, beat the world number two to seal an 8-5 victory after earlier producing a nine-dart finish and a maximum 170 check-out.\nAsked afterwards what he had just achieved, the teenager who beat Nathan Aspinall in the last eight and Gerwyn Price to reach the final, told ITV4: “You tell me. I don’t know. I’m happy to win.”\nEverything @LukeTheNuke180 touches turns to gold 🌴 pic.twitter.com/9IGfjUB5ZG\n— PDC Darts (@OfficialPDC) January 19, 2024\n“Earlier on the quarters, obviously I hit the nine against Nathan, but I played well yesterday and I’ve played well again tonight.\n“No one probably believes it, but I’ve not thrown a dart since the world final. Yesterday, that was the first proper practice I’ve put in, but it’s all paid off.\n“I’m just happy to win, obviously, against Michael. He’s still one of the best, he’s the very best and I’m just happy to win on my debut.”\nVan Gerwen was magnanimous in defeat, but urged people not to put pressure on the game’s new potential superstar.\nHe said: “Everyone says he’s the new kid, but everyone knows what he is capable of. The crowd, the television, everyone wants to make him bigger, but he’s already a good player.\n“I know we all want to push him, but let him grow, let him do other things. You have to learn, the crowd has to learn and everyone who is involved in television has to learn. Don’t push him too much.\nStory continues “Of course we know he’s a good player, but give him his time and after, he will come, no problems.”\nLUKE LITTLER IS THE 2024 BAHRAIN DARTS MASTER 🏆\nSimply breathtaking from the 16-year-old… 🙌\nHe hits a nine-darter, and beats Man Lok Leung, Nathan Aspinall, Gerwyn Price and MIchael van Gerwen to win his first PDC Senior title.\nThe first of how many…? pic.twitter.com/aCSSJ6sTnD\n— PDC Darts (@OfficialPDC) January 19, 2024\nEnglishman Littler threw first in the final and with the first seven legs all going with the darts, took a 4-3 lead into the break.\nHe edged in front with the first break on his return, but the Dutchman took out 85 with outer bull and two double tops to reduce the deficit in the next before levelling at 5-5.\nBut as both players struggled to land doubles, it was the youngster who held his nerve and having audaciously left himself 170 in the 13th leg, eventually checked out with single 18 and double top to win 8-5.\nAs absorbing a final as it was, it lacked the fireworks of Littler’s earlier matches, which started with a nine-darter in the first leg of his 6-3 last-eight win over compatriot Aspinall.\nLUKE LITTLER HITS A NINE-DARTER! 🚨\nMore history from the 16-year-old sensation!!! 🌟 pic.twitter.com/o23C5P6AqL\n— PDC Darts (@OfficialPDC) January 19, 2024\nThat booked him a semi-final clash with another former world champion in Price – who had beaten newly-crowned world champion Humphries 6-4 in the previous round – and the contest was a little less explosive.\nLittler, who turns 17 on Sunday, landed a maximum 170 finish on his way to a 7-3 win over the Welshman, who himself hit 124 and 146 check-outs as he attempted to keep pace.\nVan Gerwen had edged his way into the final with a 7-6 victory over Michael Smith after disposing of Rob Cross 6-4 in the quarter-finals.\nTRENDING 1.

    "title": "Steelers, Bills clinch AFC playoff berths: Titans' upset of Jaguars opens door as Pittsburgh, Buffalo get in - Top World News Today",
    "text": "The Titans ‘ fan base exponentially increased after Tennessee knocked out the Jaguars , who were eliminated from playoff contention following Sunday’s 28-20 loss. By virtue of the Titans’ win, both the Steelers and Bills clinched playoff berths ( check out the entire playoff picture here ). The Steelers took care of their business after defeating Baltimore on Saturday. Buffalo (10-6) still has a chance to capture the AFC East division crown — and the No. 2 seed that comes with it — if it can defeat Miami on Sunday night. This is the Steelers’ first playoff berth since 2021, which was also Ben Roethlisberger’s final season as Pittsburgh’s quarterback. Pittsburgh went 9-8 last year but missed the playoffs when they did not receive the help they needed during the final weekend of the regular season. The Steelers’ playoffs hopes this season were murky after a three-game losing streak dropped their record to 7-7. But Pittsburgh responded with three straight wins after coach Mike Tomlin inserted Mason Rudolph as his starting quarterback. Rudolph, who has completed a whopping 74.3 percent passes over that span, has been complemented by a highly-successful rushing attack and a defense that has forced six turnovers during the winning streak. By winning 10 regular season games, the Steelers surpassed the 2001-19 Patriots with the second-longest streak without a losing season in NFL history. Tomlin also made history, too, as he extended his NFL record with 17 consecutive non-losing seasons to begin a head coaching career. He made more history on Sunday when he surpassed Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher with the most 10-win seasons in franchise history. Pittsburgh is playing well at the right time, but they suffered a significant loss when former Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt suffered an MCL sprain that is slated to keep him sidelined for multiple weeks. The Steelers may have Watt back in the lineup if they can advance beyond the first round of the playoffs. The Bills are in the postseason after winning their last four games. Pro Bowl running back James Cook is a big reason for Buffalo’s resurgence. Cook was nothing short of dominant in Week 15, when he rushed for 179 yards and a touchdown in the Bills’ 31-10 win over the Cowboys . While the Bills and Steelers are advancing, the Jaguars are going home are dropping five of their last six games. Injuries to Trevor Lawrence and Christian Kirk were critical factors in the Jaguars’ massive slide.",

    "text": "“Con el diablo nunca hay que dialogar. Jesús nunca dialogó con el diablo, lo ahuyentó. (...) Tened cuidado. El diablo es un seductor”, dijo Francisco durante su catequesis dedicada a los vicios y las virtudes. Y agregó: “Nunca dialoguen con él porque es más listo que todos nosotros. Y nos lo hará pagar. Cuando llegue la tentación, no dialoguéis nunca. Cierra la puerta, cierra la ventana, cierra tu corazón. Y así nos defendemos de esta seducción, porque el diablo es astuto e inteligente”. “Con el diablo nunca se debe discutir. Es astuto e inteligente. Incluso utilizó citas bíblicas para tentar a Jesús. Es capaz de disfrazar el mal bajo una invisible máscara de bien. Por eso hay que estar siempre alerta, cerrando inmediatamente el más mínimo resquicio cuando intenta penetrar en nosotros”, agregó. Advirtió de que “hay personas que han caído en adicciones que ya no pudieron superar, como las drogas, el alcoholismo y el juego, solo porque subestimaron un riesgo. Se creyeron fuertes en una batalla de nada, pero en lugar de eso acabaron siendo presa de un enemigo poderoso”. “Cuando el mal arraiga en nosotros, entonces toma el nombre de vicio, y es una mala hierba difícil de erradicar. Sólo se consigue a costa de un duro trabajo”, añadió. Además, Francisco pidió rezar para que terminen las guerras. “La guerra es un mal”, afirmó durante la audiencia general. “Por favor no olvidemos rezar por todos los que sufren las terribles consecuencias de la violencia y la guerra, especialmente recemos por la martirizada Ucrania y por el pueblo de Israel y Palestina”, dijo el papa en un nuevo llamamiento. Y agregó: “La guerra es un mal. Recemos por el fin de las guerras”. Como en todas las ocasiones públicas, el Papa aprovechó para pedir el fin de las guerras, también instó a luchar por la paz ante el “desierto de muerte” en Siria, Gaza y Ucrania. En el mensaje de Navidad de este lunes antes de la bendición ‘urbi et orbi’, el pontífice aseguró que “la gente, que no quiere armas sino pan, que le cuesta seguir adelante y pide paz, ignora cuántos fondos públicos se destinan a los armamentos. ¡Y, sin embargo, deberían saberlo!”.",

    "text": "News Health\nPsychedelic drug ibogaine successfully treats PTSD, TBI in veterans, study says\nLong Island veterans suffering with traumatic brain injuries, along with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, may have new hope in the form of a psychedelic drug, currently banned in the United States and found only in the African rainforest, according to a new study released Friday by Stanford Medicine.\nThe\nreport, published in Nature Medicine, found that ibogaine, the psychoactive component of the iboga plant and used for centuries in spiritual ceremonies because of its hallucinogenic properties, effectively treated traumatic brain injuries among 30 U.S. special operations forces veterans who received the drug at a laboratory in Mexico.\n“No other drug has ever been able to alleviate the functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms of traumatic brain injury,” said Nolan Williams, an associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford and the study's lead investigator. “The results are dramatic, and we intend to study this compound further.”\nLow risk, high reward\nThe findings, which come amid growing federal support for the use of psychedelic drugs to treat veterans, is among the first to study ibogaine, which is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is currently prohibited for use in the U.S. Most recently, ibogaine has been used in the treatment of narcotics addiction and depression.\nPatrick Donohue of Islip, a veterans attorney and advocate with Project 9 Line, which helps former military members transition back into civilian life, supports the new treatment. He said research has shown that psychedelic drugs such as MDMA and psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms, have been used to treat veterans for years with little risk.\n“It's going to benefit veterans in the long run, and they're going to save so many lives,” said Donohue, who spent six months with the Army's 101st Airborne Division near a burn pit in Afghanistan that left with a noncancerous brain tumor. “And the risk that they're taking by allowing sick veterans with PTSD and TBI to take these is so minimal. They're not addictive at all. So we're risking nothing and the reward could save lives immediately.”\nBetween 2000 and 2020, more than 430,000 service members nationwide were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, often caused by head trauma or blast explosions and leading to a host of other ailments, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse and suicide, according to state and federal statistics.\nLong Island has an estimated 110,000 veterans, the most of any region in the state.\nAfter years of resistance, there is growing federal support for utilizing psychedelic treatments on service members.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Biden last month, includes $10 million to fund clinical trials in the use of four psychedelic drugs, including ibogaine, to treat PTSD and traumatic brain injuries experienced by active-duty military members.\n'Groundbreaking and life-changing'\nFor its study, Stanford teamed with Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or\nVETS, a Texas-based nonprofit that helps facilitate psychedelic-assisted therapies for service members.\nMarcus Capone, who served multiple combat tours as a Navy SEAL and grew up in Long Beach, founded VETS after struggling for years with the effects of traumatic brain injury and PTSD. After years of therapy and failed prescription treatments, Capone tried ibogaine at a retreat in Mexico and found himself healed of all symptoms.\n“I was at my breaking point,” said Capone, who launched VETS to provide similar treatment options to service members. “If you asked me to stand on my head for two days to get better I would have done that.”\nIn total, 30 special operations veterans, all men with a history of TBI and other psychiatric symptoms, were treated with oral ibogaine and magnesium sulfate — used to prevent heart complications associated with the hallucinogen — at a clinic in Mexico, where the drug is unregulated. None of the participants were from New York.\nThe veterans began the study with an average rating of 30.2 on the World Health Organization's Disability Assessment Scale, indicating a mild to moderate disability, the report said. In addition, 23 of the vets met the criteria for PTSD; 14 for an anxiety disorder; 15 for alcohol abuse; 19 had, at one point, been suicidal and seven had previously attempted suicide.\nOne month after a single treatment of ibogaine, researchers said, their rating on the WHO scale improved to 5.1, indicating no disability. Side effects, investigators said, were limited to mild headaches and nausea.\nParticipants also experienced average reductions of 88% in PTSD symptoms, 87% in depression symptoms and 81% in anxiety symptoms, along with improvements in concentration, information processing, memory and impulsivity, Stanford found.\n“These men were incredibly intelligent, high-performing individuals who experienced life-altering functional disability from TBI during their time in combat,” said Williams, who is planning further analysis of the data. “They were all willing to try most anything that they thought might help them get their lives back.”\nIf ibogaine is ultimately removed from the prohibited substance list and approved for medical use in the U.S., it would be the first known treatment for traumatic brain injury, Capone said.\n“This could potentially be groundbreaking and life-changing for individuals that are struggling with TBI and just can't get the help,” he said. “Veterans should be excited that there's definitely hope in drug development and in alternative treatments that are happening pretty fast right now.”\nUpdated 24 minutes ago Watching winter storm ...
