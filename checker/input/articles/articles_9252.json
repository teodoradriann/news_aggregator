    "text": "2023-12-28 23:20:00 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discusses “peace formula” with Pope Francis Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently took to his former Twitter account to announce that he had a conversation with Pope Francis about Ukraine’s “peace formula.” During their discussion, Zelensky mentioned that representatives of over 80 countries are already involved in the process and more will be joining soon. In addition to discussing the peace formula, Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the Pope for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and its citizens. Zelensky also thanked the Pope for his “blessings and wishes for peace for all of us,” and expressed his appreciation for the Vatican’s support of Ukraine’s efforts. The conversation between Zelensky and Pope Francis comes at a crucial time for Ukraine as the country continues to navigate its relationship with neighboring Russia and strives for peace within its borders. The involvement of over 80 countries in Ukraine’s peace formula process signals international support for the country’s efforts, and the additional support from the Vatican further strengthens Ukraine’s position on the global stage. As the situation in Ukraine continues to develop, Zelensky’s discussion with Pope Francis highlights the importance of diplomatic relations and international cooperation in achieving peace and stability in the region. #Zelensky #discussed #Pope #peace #formula #Ukraine",

    "text": "By Harry Stedman ,\n34 minutes ago Freezing conditions will continue throughout the weekend (Yui Mok/PA) PA Wire Large parts of the country will face disruption from heavy snow and freezing rain over the weekend after forecasters issued two amber weather warnings.\nStranded vehicles on the roads, delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and power cuts are all likely as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nThere is also a “good chance” that rural communities could be cut off due to the conditions, with up to 30cm of snowfall expected locally.\nIt comes after initial data indicated Rostherne in Cheshire and Yeovilton in Somerset saw temperatures drop to minus 5C overnight into Friday, just shy of previous estimates which suggested the mercury could dip as low as minus 8C.\nTemperatures of minus 10C could be seen in parts of rural Scotland on Friday night, according to new Met Office forecasts.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January last year was minus 14C, in Dalwhinnie in the Highlands.\nAn amber warning for snow and freezing rain covering most of Wales and central England , including the Midlands and the north-west cities of Liverpool and Manchester, is in place from 6pm on Saturday to midday on Sunday, the Met Office said.\nThe second warning for snow, covering most of northern England including Leeds, Sheffield and the Lake District, has been issued from 9pm on Saturday to midnight on Sunday.\nBoth of the warning areas can expect to see 3cm to 7cm of snowfall widely, while snow may mix with rain at times in lower-lying areas, the forecaster said.\nCold temperatures across England, including in Kent, will remain throughout the weekend amid a yellow weather warning (Gareth Fuller/PA) (PA Wire) Three separate yellow weather warnings for snow and ice are already in place for most areas of the UK, covering different periods of time from Friday to Monday afternoon.\nMet Office chief forecaster Jason Kelly said some “significant accumulations” of snow are possible in parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England, and the additional factor of strengthening winds could lead to drifting of lying snow.\nHe continued: “There is a risk of freezing rain across parts of the Midlands and northern England, but especially Wales, adding to the risk of ice and leading to some treacherous conditions in places.\n“As the super-cooled rain droplets hit the surface they instantly freeze, covering everything in a layer of ice, making it extremely dangerous.”\nLincolnshire Police said it was investigating whether a crash near Grantham which left a seven-month-old baby dead on Thursday night was linked to icy conditions.\nA yellow Honda Jazz car left the southbound carriageway on the A1 shortly after 10.50pm before it hit a tree and returned to the road.\nNational Highways advised those planning to travel over the weekend to check their vehicles, keep their distance on the roads and pack a “snow kit” of blankets, food, water and a shovel.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nMuch of the country will face several days of bitterly cold temperatures (Yui Mok/PA) (PA Wire) Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said on Friday it is “a weekend to layer up and put the heating on” due to the cold conditions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “We are heading into a cold snap this weekend and I know there are lots of concerns, not just amongst charity leaders, but also among NHS and social care leaders as well, about the particular risks and vulnerabilities this weekend as temperatures drop, both in terms of risk of accident and injury, but also risk from the cold itself.\n“This is a weekend to wrap up and keep warm, to take sensible precautions about going out and about.”\n(PA Graphics) (PA Graphics) Councils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: “Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n“St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.”\nMilder air will briefly cover some southern areas during the weekend before a new northerly flow allows colder conditions to return across the UK next week, the Met Office said.\nDeputy chief forecaster Dan Holley said temperatures would remain below average with some areas struggling to get above freezing for several days.\nFurther weather warnings could be issued for the start of next week.",

    "text": "Soon, the Judiciary Committee will consider promoting a magistrate in New York, Sarah Nutburn, to the District Court after a less than judicious committee process. Judge Nutburn&#039;s hearing was a contentious affair. You should go watch it. My friends, the junior senator from Louisiana and Texas had the judge dead. The rights on her judicial activism from the bench. She was clearly prepared for their line of questioning, but by the end, she wilted under the withering fire from my colleagues. That&#039;s when the acting chairwoman of the committee got involved. After Republicans were finished questioning Judge Nutburn, she invited the nominee to defend herself. Her defense, of course, flatly contradicted her written opinion. As a judge. Committee Republicans rightly objected. It&#039;s one thing to give a nominee the chance to rehabilitate herself. But giving her the last word as she lied to the committee is a different matter entirely. After the nominee gave two different explanations for why she had engaged in political activism from the bench, committee Democrats blocked further questions and close the hearing. It sounds an awful lot. Like the way another nominee, Adele Manji, explained his policy views to liberal interest groups. Only after the committee was finished questioning him, Judge Nutburn got the last word here. As the junior senator from Louisiana said, it looks an awful lot like a cover up. Apparently, it&#039;s not enough for Senate Democrats to rubber stamp radicals to the courts. They desperately don&#039;t want the American people to even know about it. Well, it&#039;s not working. The Judiciary Committee has received almost 100 letters. From liberals opposing Judge Nut Burns activism. The cat is literally out of the bag, so I would urge my colleagues to pay attention to what happens in the Judiciary Committee as Judge Network&#039;s nomination.",

    "text": "La deputata Guerra chiama Mulé “signora presidente”: “Basta rivolgersi alle donne al maschile”\n\"Se lei ci tiene al suo genere, io tengo al mio. Basta rivolgersi a noi donne con appellativi maschili\". A metterlo in chiaro, prendendo la parola durante la discussione sulla Manovra alla Camera, è la deputata del Partito democratico, Maria Cecilia Guerra. Rivolgendosi al presidente di turno, Giorgio Mulé, di Forza Italia, Guerra lo ha chiamato \"Signora presidente\", un appellativo che lui non ha gradito. La sua reazione, del resto, serviva esattamente a rimarcare un punto: perché in Parlamento c'è ancora chi si rivolge alle colleghe definendole al maschile, come \"deputato\" piuttosto che \"senatore\"?\nGuerra, in particolare, si riferiva all'appellativo dato dal deputato di Fratelli d'Italia, Marco Perissa, alla leader dem, Elly Schlein. Perissa non l'ha chiamata \"segretaria\" – come vorrebbe la lingua italiana – ma \"segretario\".\n\"Il deputato Marco Perissa ha parlato della segretaria del mio partito chiamandola al maschile ritenendo che questa sia una scelta che a lui compete. Quindi se è permesso rivolgersi a una donna con appellativo maschile, allora è consentito anche a me rivolgermi a lei al femminile a meno che non richiami tutti quelli che continuano a chiamare le donne al maschile. Lei tiene al suo genere, io tengo al mio\", ha spiegato Guerra.\nDa parte sua, Mulé, dopo essersi sentito appellare al femminile, aveva risposto: \"Onorevole Guerra, avrei qualcosa da ridire. La mia identità è quella e se si rivolge a me lo faccia come presidente, non si può rivolgere a me come ‘signora presidente'\".\nLa questione della correttezza di genere nel linguaggio è un tema particolarmente discusso in questa legislatura, soprattutto da quando Giorgia Meloni ha chiesto espressamente di essere chiamata al maschile, \"il presidente del Consiglio\". Appena qualche settimana fa una settantina di parlamentari ha scritto\nuna lettera al presidente del Senato, Ignazio La Russa, in cui chiedeva che a Palazzo Madama venisse sempre garantito il \"rispetto del linguaggio di genere\" e che fosse \"riconosciuto il diritto di ogni senatrice ad essere chiamata senatrice e non senatore\". <a href=\"https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/veglia-per-vanessa-ballan-in-duomo-in-quattrocento-per-dire-basta-alla-violenza-sulle-donne/\">\n</a>",

    "text": "PEDRO PORRO’S sublime strike fired Tottenham to a hard-fought 1-0 win over stubborn Burnley in the FA Cup third round on Friday.\nPorro bagged his first goal this season with just 12 minutes left in north London to spare Tottenham the prospect of an unwanted trip to Turf Moor for a replay.\nTottenham’s progress to the fourth round made it five wins from their last six games in all competitions as they continue to bounce back from their autumn slump.\nCoach Ange Postecoglou said this week that it is Tottenham’s ambition to win a trophy like the FA Cup “every year”.\nWithout a major triumph since winning the 2008 League Cup, Tottenham fans would gladly take any silverware at present, no matter the competition.\nThey won the last of their eight FA Cups in 1991 and Postecoglou would dearly love to mark his first season in charge by ending that long wait for a ninth.\nThe road to Wembley started for Tottenham without Son Heung-min, who is on Asian Cup duty with South Korea, and Pape Sarr, who has departed to play for Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations.\nPostecoglou’s team were the dominant side even without Son and Sarr.\nRicharlison dragged his shot wide of the far post after slaloming through the Burnley defence in the early stages.\nBrennan Johnson’s curler was pushed away by Burnley keeper Arijanet Muric, who also saved well from Richarlison.\nGiovani Lo Celso opened the second half with a long-range shot that was repelled by the over-worked Muric.\nTottenham pushed hard in the closing stages, with Muric saving again from Johnson before the breakthrough finally arrived.\nMuric had been in such good form that it was going to take something special to beat him and Porro duly delivered in the 78th minute.\nAfter winning back possession in the Burnley half, the Spanish defender took aim from the right-hand side of the area and unfurled a ferocious shot that bent into the far corner as Muric stood rooted to the spot.\nBurnley’s exit leaves Vincent Kompany’s second-bottom side free to focus on their fight for Premier League survival.\n- Doyle rescues Wolves -\n10-man Wolves rescued a 1-1 draw at Brentford thanks to Tommy Doyle’s stunning strike.\nWolves midfielder Joao Gomes was sent off after just nine minutes for an ugly studs-up challenge on Christian Norgaard.\nNeal Maupay fired Brentford ahead when he rifled into the top corner after Wolves failed to clear a 41st-minute free-kick.\nBut Doyle equalised for the four-time FA Cup winners in the 64th minute with a blistering drive from the edge of the area.\nThe draw ended Brentford’s run of five successive defeats and Wolves’ spell of three consecutive wins, which had included a 4-1 victory over the Bees in December.\nFulham ground out a 1-0 win against Championship strugglers Rotherham at Craven Cottage.\nThe Cottagers have a League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool on Wednesday, so Marco Silva prioritised the trip to Anfield as he made eight changes from the New Year’s Eve win over Arsenal.\nSilva’s reserves were still strong enough to leave Rotherham without an away victory since November 2022 as Bobby De Cordova-Reid bagged the winner from the edge of the area in the 24th minute.",

    "title": "Trump’s latest sentencing delay request spurs debate: 'Not an easy call' or 'hard pass'?",
    "text": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump appears for his hush money trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 28, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Steven Hirsch - Pool/Getty Images) Donald Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for his New York State criminal conviction win 34 felony fraud counts next month, but on Thursday the ex-president, who was granted immunity for official acts by the U.S. Supreme Court, asked Judge Juan Merchan for another delay, until after the November election – claiming not granting one would amount to “election interference.” Legal experts seem split on what could, and should, happen. “Trump, who was convicted for his criminal efforts to conceal information from the public in the days leading up to the 2016 election, is now asking the judge to delay sentencing and therefore deprive the public of relevant information in the days leading up to the 2024 election,” noted national security attorney Brad Moss. “It’s a pattern with this guy.” It’s a pattern that’s being noticed. “Trump also feverishly tried to delay the start of the trial earlier this year, filing successive unsuccessful interim stay requests in a state appellate court the week before opening arguments in April,” Courthouse News reports. “Like those efforts, legal analyst Jeffrey Evan Gold believes this latest letter to be a longshot ask. Gold, a criminal defense attorney at the New Jersey-based Helmer, Conley &amp; Kasselman, told Courthouse News on Thursday that Merchan is likely ‘fed up’ with Trump’s constant delay efforts.” “The judge seems aggravated, and I would be too,” Gold said. Gold also suggests Judge Merchan might move ahead with the September 18 sentencing date, but hold off on the effective date until after the November election. Professor of law and MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance, a former U.S. Attorney sees no need for compromise and suggests the judge should stick to the schedule. She writes: “Judge Merchan should give this one a hard pass.” But MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin is looking deeply into Trump’s letter, and suggests the “conventional wisdom” that Trump will not obtain a delay might be flawed. Also flawed, Rubin writes, is Trump’s attorneys’ letter to Judge Merchan, which “highlights how ill equipped the Supreme Court’s immunity decision is to resolve key procedural questions in the NY case,” she notes. After looking at Trump’s thrice-denied conflict of interest claims and recusal request against Judge Merchan, Rubin adds, “Then there’s the timing of the letter. Judge Merchan moved Trump’s sentencing from 7/11 to 9/18 1) because of Trump’s post-immunity decision motion to set aside the verdict 2) and did so the day after SCOTUS ruled. They’ve known sentencing was scheduled for 9/18 for 6 weeks.” She then goes back to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling for Trump on presidential immunity. “In the ordinary course, a New York defendant would have to proceed to sentencing before a verdict is appealable. But *this* New York defendant brought a successful SCOTUS case that applies, at least in part, here,” she explains. And because Trump is being treated differently by the highest court in the land, she explains, “specifically, the Court ruled that a denial of immunity is appealable before trial. Does that mean the denial of a motion to set aside the verdict (predicated on the admission of official act evidence) must also be immediately appealable? Trump says yes.” Here’s where her suggestion that the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, at least in part, is flawed, comes into play: “Parsing the language of the majority opinion closely, the Court’s holdings that immunity decisions must be made ‘at the outset’ of the case and are appealable before trial don’t necessarily apply to evidence. But it’s also not crystal clear that they don’t.” Rubin concludes, “strip away the baseless accusations of judicial conflict &amp; prosecutorial malice, and the letter raises a serious, unanswered procedural question. I’ll predict Merchan will forge ahead–but to me, even Team Trump’s strategic delay notwithstanding, it’s not an easy call.” Related Articles: ・Ex-federal prosecutor compares Trump’s hush money case to a &#039;mafia trial&#039; ・Trump seeks to have hush money case tossed citing presidential immunity ruling: report ・A chunk of Trump’s hush money &#039;case is happening in the dark&#039;: report",

    "text": "[oghaio](/user/oghaio)a [infolibre.es](/go/link/3891441)\nPregúntale a cualquier PePetudo de tu entorno más íntimo o cercano que te diga dos medidas, sólo dos, ni una más, económicas o sociales de su PPartido y verás que no te sabe decir ni una. Es que ni una, vamos. Eso sí, insultos, acusaciones, conspiraciones y chascarrillos del Perro Sanxe y sus sosios filo-terroris-comunistas, tiene para toda la tarde.\nY así con todo con cualquier votante de derechas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Pero llamar es transitivo. Por lo tanto es \"lo llamó\" o \"la llamó\". Aunque siempre se ha dudado de usar el \"dativo\". La recomendación es \"la\" o \"lo\".\n[#33](c33#c-33) Pues tiene usted razón\nhttps://www.rae.es/duda-linguistica/es-la-llaman-maya-o-le-llaman-maya#:~:text=Cuando%20llamar%20significa%20'aplicar%20%5Ba,)%20o%20la(s).\n[#28](c28#c-28) Con este sentido era transitivo en latín y se construía con doble acusativo. Ya desde los orígenes el español vaciló entre usar en este caso las formas de dativo le(s) o las de acusativo lo(s), la(s), vacilación que se ha mantenido hasta la época actual: «En España a la papa le llaman patata» (Huneeus Cocina [Chile 1989]); «Los meseros la llamaban doña Florencia» (Jacobs Florencia [Méx. 2006]). A pesar de esta vacilación tradicional, hoy se recomienda el uso de los pronombres lo(s), la(s), pues el complemento que expresa la persona o cosa nombrada funciona como sujeto en la construcción pasiva: La papa es llamada patata en España; a esto se añade que lo usual es que el predicativo (elemento que expresa el nombre o calificativo aplicado) se refiera a un complemento directo, y no a un complemento indirecto. (Diccionario panhispánico de dudas, RAE)\n[#13](c13#c-13) Para luego pegarle hasta que deje de ser comunista, le pregunten cuantos dedos ve y responda tres o cinco depende de lo que diga el partido\n[#26](c26#c-26) O a lo mejor es que sí lo sé...\nO a lo mejor es que tú tienes muchas necesidades y pocas capacidades, que es lo ideal para el comunismo, ¿no?\n[#2](c2#c-2) te olvidas de la carcunda mediática, capaz de convertir cualquier accion de ayuso en algo digno de la virgen maria...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La socialdemocracia original teóricamente se diferenciaba de la ultraizquierda comunista en el método, querían usar las infraestructuras liberales para hacer la revolución.\nAunque, desde su primer momento, demostró que eran traidores. Y bajo ellos han hecho las peores reformas liberales que la derecha no se atrevería. Ya, en el siglo XIX, en Alemania hicieron cosas de esas.\n[#29](c29#c-29) la socialdemocracia pretende aparentar que mejora la vida de las personas bajo el sistema capitalista. Es como mejorar la vida de un enfermo, que se la mejoras pero sigue enfermo. Pero desde la teoría comunista, y el sentido común, es más que evidente que no vas a poder hacer cambios profundos sin enfrentarte a la burguesía, porque no van a dejarse quitar sus privilegios sin luchar.\nYo ya hace tiempo que me di cuenta de esto. Cuanto más se hable de las gilipolleces y burradas que suelta, menos se habla de las mejoras del gobierno o de sus liadas y cositas que hace en Madrid. Y evidentemente, los medios de comunicación le bailan el juego, así no se habla de las corruptelas que tiene.\nAyuso pidiendo casito y los meneantes dándoselo.\nLa extrema derecha “provoca escándalos” y así logra “la hegemonía en los medios”\nLeía hoy en el diario \"A la misma hora, Alberto Núñez Feijóo utilizaba el cambio para declarar que el PSOE ya no es un partido constitucional. En realidad, ya lo ha dicho tantas veces que ni llama la atención. España debe de ser el único país europeo que sólo tiene un partido democrático. El suyo, claro.\"\nEl clásico discurso de la derecha y extrema derecha: el miedo al \"comunismo\". Yo me pregunto, ¿cuál comunismo?... Lamentablemente sigue siendo un discurso que vende y sus vendedores (PP y Vox básicamente) tienen una buena calidad de vida, viven de engañar y mentir al verdadero pueblo para que seguir manteniendo su estatus y privilegios... \"para que no vuelva el \"comunismo\" es una frase recurrente en los voxistas.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Hombre sin ser Voxista como dices, ni estar polarizado ni sectarizado, quisiera saber desde mi ignorancia si hubo o hay algún país del mundo en el que aplicándose las teorías comunistas los ciudadanos hayan tenido o tengan un alto nivel de vida, no hayan estado sometidos a la tiranía de una clase política instaurada en el poder o no se haya sufrido persecución política por múltiples motivos? El Libro de la Granja de Animales de George Owell quizás ilustre muy bien las claves de esa realidad\n[#30](c30#c-30) ojo, que no solo Vox y PP, que Puigdemont soltó también algunas lindeces sobre el comunismo cuando era president,\ntiene cojones que los que hablan de fascismo todo el día, los que llaman extrema derecha a todo el que piensa distinto, los que llaman ultraderecha a la gente, ahora se pongan a llorar porque les llaman \"comunistas\".\nEl infame presidente Sánchez, cuando anunció la convocatoria de elecciones dijo que lo hacía para evitar el avance \"de la extrema derecha y la derecha extrema\" ¡El propio presidente dijo eso de manera oficial!!!!\nHipocresía no, lo siguiente. Sinverguenzas. Y encima se lo creen y se indignan, los muy ofendiditos.\nCaraduras.\nSi los medios de derecha, y algunos de izquierda, no fueran altavoz de esta individua multiplicando sus estupideces Ayuso sería lo que es, una mala gestora y una política mediocre, pero todos le ríen las gracias y dan pábulo a sus lecturas de guion. Han creado un personaje, un cáncer para la convivencia y la inteligencia.",
