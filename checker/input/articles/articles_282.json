    "title": "Saints' Ryan Ramczyk uncertain of NFL future due to cartilage defect - ESPN",
    "text": "METAIRIE, La. -- [New Orleans Saints](/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints) right tackle [Ryan Ramczyk](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917676/ryan-ramczyk) said he has a cartilage defect in his knee that has cast uncertainty on his NFL future beyond the 2023 season. The 29-year-old player, who missed the past two games with the knee injury, said he's going to talk with doctors in the offseason to see whether there is anything that could fix the issues that have lingered for the past three seasons. \"I don't know,\" Ramczyk said about a possible fix. \"I think those are the discussions we are going to have, that need to be had, and we'll go from there. ... I'll talk with surgeons, doctors, get as much as information as I can and then just make the best decision.\" Ramczyk said that there is not a lot of cartilage left in the injured knee and that the wear and tear of playing in the NFL has taken its toll. \"This year it's bugged me a little bit more than it has in the past,\" he said. \"At some point, I just couldn't play anymore.\" Ramczyk said it was frustrating to have what he described as a \"nagging problem,\" especially after entering this season with optimism that he could manage the injury. He did not miss a game to injury in his first four NFL seasons, but then missed seven games in 2021 due to his knee. He did not have surgery, and he controlled the problem with injections in the 2022 offseason. He played all of the 2022 season without much incident. \"Last year was good. ... My knee was good. This offseason was good, I thought,\" Ramczyk said. The Saints have managed Ramczyk's workload this season by giving him a rest day during every practice week. Pain management, however, has been an issue since Week 1. \"It really was Week 1 that my knee lit up,\" Ramczyk said. \"So, kind of dealing with it all year. ... After that last [game], I think it was Carolina, I just couldn't go anymore.\" He and the Saints are taking things week by week to see whether he could return for the season finale, or a playoff game, if the Saints make it to the postseason. The 2017 first-round pick out of Wisconsin signed a five-year, $96 million extension in 2021 that made him the highest-paid right tackle in the league. He still has three years remaining on that deal. \"I feel like I'm not done yet. I feel like I still want to play,\" Ramczyk said. \"I feel like I'm still passionate about the game. When you think about it like that, my mind frame is, 'I want to play, and I want to keep doing it, so what can I do to get better, to not have this happen in-season?'\" There will be significant salary cap implications for the Saints if Ramczyk retires. His cap number of $27 million will be the Saints' second-highest number in 2024, and the team is projected to be significantly over the cap again. Releasing Ramczyk before June 1 would result in a $32 million dead money hit due to the prorated signing bonus amounts remaining on his deal. When former Saints quarterback Drew Brees retired in 2021, the Saints lowered his salary to the veteran minimum, allowing them to spend in free agency and spread out his cap hit over two years. Ramczyk will enter the 2024 offseason with a base salary of $17 million -- $6.5 million of which was guaranteed for injury, and that portion will become fully guaranteed on the third day of the 2024 league year.",

    "text": "Meteor Shower Will Light Up the Sky With \"Bright Fireballs\" Next Week—How to See It\nThe impressive Quadrantids will put on a show when they reach their peak.\nThe night sky is special because it presents a unique opportunity to take in vast amounts of natural beauty from practically anywhere you are. Everything from\nbrightly shining planets to passing comets can put on a show for all of us down here on Earth. But if you want to start 2024 with a memorable sight, you might want to clear your evening calendar over the coming days. That's because a meteor shower will light up the sky next week with \"bright fireballs.\" Read on for more on how you can catch this impressive event.\nRELATED:\nThe Next Total Solar Eclipse Will Be the Last Until 2044, NASA Says.\nThe Quadrantid meteor shower will kick off the new year with a dazzling show.\nYou won't have to wait long into the new year for a major celestial sight. The Quadrantids meteor shower is now underway and will be\nputting on a show in the night sky over the next few weeks, according to NASA.\nSimilar to other meteor showers, the Quadtrantids are created by Earth passing through a cosmic debris field. But unlike many other major annual showers born from the dusty remnants of comet tails, these result from a passing asteroid known as 2003 EH1, which orbits the sun once roughly every five and a half years. The small object was only recently discovered in 2003 and measures only about two miles in diameter, per NASA.\nLike the Ursids, Gemonids, and Perseids, the Quadrantids also derive their name from their radiant point, which in this case is a constellation known as \"Quadrans Muralis.\" However, unlike the other major showers, this event's namesake is no longer recognized as a celestial body after an update of recognized modern constellations in 1922 did away with the designation. Because of this, the Quadrantids are sometimes also known as the Bootids, thanks to the Bootes constellation that took its place.\nRELATED:\n6 Stargazing Secrets, According to Astronomy Experts.\nThe highly active shower is considered by astronomers to be one of the best of the year.\nPart of the Quadtrantids' high esteem among astronomers rests in the fact that they tend to start the year off with a bang. The event is considered by many to be \"one of the best annual meteor showers,\" producing 60 to as many as 200 meteors per hour during its peak, according to NASA.\nThey also tend to look more impressive, too. Since the particles that create them are somewhat larger, Quadrantids tend to produce \"bright fireballs\" that can linger in the sky much longer than an average streaking meteor.\nRELATED:\n\"Devil Comet\" With Horns Is Racing Toward Us—Here's When and Where It Arrives.\nThe Quadrantids will hit their peak late at night next week.\nIf you're planning on catching the spectacle for yourself, prepare to set aside some time next week for stargazing. The Quadrantids are\nset to peak on the night of Jan. 3 through the morning of Jan. 4, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS).\nBut while the meteors have earned a reputation for their brilliance, they're not exactly the most convenient shower to catch in terms of bedtime. Viewers should expect the most activity to occur in the early morning hours of Jan. 4 between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., per AMS. However, it's best not to put it off: While the meteors will still be visible through Jan. 16, the window for the peak is notably brief due to the Earth's trajectory through the asteroid's debris trail, according to NASA.\nEven though clear weather is always ideal for viewing, it's not the only condition that could affect this year's experience. A half-full moon will also rise on the night of the Quadrantids' peak, which could make it harder to see some of the brilliant objects as they light up the sky.\nRELATED:\nScientists Finally Explain Mysterious Signals From Distant \"Hell\" Planet.\nHere are a few other pointers for making the best out of your stargazing experience.\nGetting a good view of the Quadtrantids shouldn't be too hard for people in the Northern Hemisphere. But for the best chance at seeing as many as possible, find a location that's far from city and street lights that could drown out the meteors, NASA suggests.\nIf you're worried about the moon drowning out your view, there's still a way to protect your eyes from the glare. According to AMS, finding a spot with a tree or building that blocks it out and looking to the north can help.\nAnd while it's always important to prepare for the elements while stargazing, frigid winter weather makes proper planning all the more critical. Dress warmly and bring along a sleeping back or blanket that will allow you to stay toasty while reclining on your back to take in as much of the sky as possible, NASA suggests. You should also give yourself as many as 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.\nRELATED:\n<a href=\"https://bestlifeonline.com/newsletters/\">For more up-to-date information, sign up for our\ndaily newsletter</a>.\nRead more\n-\nSource:\nNASA: Quadrantids",

    "title": "Fans point out lavish lifestyle of Kareena Kapoor while endorsing 'Luxury is not everything'",
    "text": "Pataudi Parivaar's bahu and actor Kareena Kapoor is the OG diva and charms her fans with her screen presence, not only is she a versatile actor but also a doting mommy to Taimur and Jeh. The actor is an avid social media user and often drops pictures and videos from her photoshoots, vacation getaways and her videos from her workouts. Kareena Kapoor's recent Instagram story landed her in trouble, the actor took to her iG story and shared a quote by Hollywood filmmaker Clint Eastwood that said luxury isn't about money, but the small joys of life, said the quote wasn't well received by netizens as they were of the view that she travels to Switzerland, Europe, and has guards taking care of her and nannies for her kids. She lives in a lavish mansion and is living an ultra-luxurious life. Netizens were irked by Kareena's ironic statement. Kareena recently reposted a quote attributed to Clint Eastwood, 94, on her Instagram Stories and wrote along with it, \"Read it again and again (red heart emoji).\" The quote states, \"Don't look for luxury in watches or bracelets, don't look for it in mansions or sailboats; luxury is laughter and friends, luxury is not being sick, luxury is the rain on your face, and luxury is hugs and kisses. Don't look for luxury in stores or in gifts, don't look for it in parties or events. Luxury is that people love you, luxury is that they respect you, luxury is that your parents live, luxury is being able to play with your grandchildren, luxury is those little things that cannot be bought with money.\" Redditors didn't spare the actor and they slammed her brutally A Redditor shared Kareena's Story and wrote along with a screenshot of the same, \"Made me laugh. People living in luxury talking about how luxury is not the most important thing in life.\" They added, \"No hate or jealousy here but I always find it funny (and tone-deaf) when people who are uber-rich post about how money is not everything in life. I mean if you had gotten the short end of the stick in life, surely 'materialistic' things would be first on your list.\" One of them commented, \"As Micheal Corleone said in Godfather 2, 'This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.\" Another wrote, \"The irony. This woman has Pataudi Palace and goes to Gstaad every year.\" \"They live in their own bubble. Take luxury out of their lives then we'll see,\" mentioned a user. \"This is a luxury. Money gives you that luxury to talk sh*t like this,\" read another comment. This isn't the first time Kareena has landed herself in controversy, recently, Kareena responded to the legal notice issued to her in May by the Madhya Pradesh High Court over a petition filed by advocate Christopher Anthony asking for a ban on the sale of her book 'Kareena Kapoor Khan's Pregnancy Bible'. The actor in her reply through lawyers Divya Krishna Billaiya and Nikhil Bhatt said that she had no intentions of hurting any religious sentiments. The actress in her reply reportedly also called the book 'Pregnancy Bible' her 'third child.' What is the issue regarding Kareena's book? Christopher Anthony, a social activist from Jabalpur, stated that the word 'Bible' in Kareena's memoir's title is hurtful to the sentiments of the Christian community. \"The Bible is the holy book of Christianity all over the world and it is wrong to compare Kareena Kapoor Khan's pregnancy with the Bible,\" he is reported to have said in his petition. What's next? The Madhya Pradesh High Court has scheduled the next hearing in the matter by Justice GS Ahluwalia on September 10. Kareena's book 'Kareena Kapoor Khan's Pregnancy Bible' was published on 10 August 2021. Work Front Kareena will be next seen in The Buckingham Murders, Singham Again, and Meghna Gulzar's [upcoming film.](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/kareena-looks-older-karisma-fans-compare-kapoor-sisters-they-enjoy-weekend-saif-ali-khan-871530)",
