    "text": "Opinión\nEl Madrid, dos veces siete y más\nEl madridismo, desde Bernabéu hasta Florentino Pérez, es una religión de éxito y de victoria\nKarol Wojtyla (1920-2005), Papa Juan Pablo II, decía que «de todas las cosas sin importancia, el fútbol es, de largo, la más importante». Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Papa Francisco, hincha del San Lorenzo de Almagro, no le llevará la contraria. Hoy sábado, 1 de junio, no hay nada poco importante que lo sea más que la final de la Champions League, entre el Real Madrid y el Borussia de Dortmund. Para los madridistas es otra oportunidad de confirmar la supremacía del gen ganador de su equipo. Sus adversarios, con los culés en primera fila, sueñan con el fracaso del rival. El resto es literatura. Paul Auster, americano, decía que «el fútbol es un milagro que permite a Europa odiarse, sin destruirse». No le faltaba razón. Jean Paul Sartre, siempre cínico, defensor del fútbol cuando en España parecía algo para ignorantes de derechas, apuntaba que «en el fútbol todo se complica por la presencia del rival». Santiago Bernabéu, el sembrador del gen de la victoria en el ADN del Real Madrid, era más prosaico: «Ahora todos los conjuntos dan guerra». Es lo que pasará esta noche. Los germanos, multirraciales y multinacionales, porque el fútbol es la apoteosis de la globalización, no solo darán guerra, sino que aspiran a ganar y, claro, no es deseable, pero sí posible\nEl Real Madrid es favorito Wembley, el último gran coliseo en el que le falta alzar la \"Orejona\". Eso le perjudica, pero noventa minutos ante los «blancos» «sono molti longui» balbuceaba en «itañol» Juanito, al que el Bernabéu homenajea en el minuto siete de cada partido: «Illa, illa, illa, Juanito maravilla». El madridismo, desde Bernabéu hasta Florentino Pérez, es una religión de éxito, de victoria, de espíritu churchilliano: «La victoria a toda costa, victoria a pesar del terror, victoria por largo y duro que sea el camino, porque sin victoria no hay supervivencia». La supervivencia es ganar y ganar, pero sobre todo cuando «ya nada se espera», escribía Gabriel Celaya, algo que rechaza el gen ganador del Real Madrid, aunque alguna vez se despiste. Esperemos que hoy no lo haga. Bernabéu ganó seis Copas de Europa con un club que gestionaba con un cuaderno de tapas de hule. Florentino Pérez, al frente un proyecto valorado en más de 5.000 millones, puede lograr hoy siete Champions y superar todo. Dos veces siete veces y una más y las que vendrán, porque está escrito en el gen ganador del Real Madrid que, entre todas las cosas sin importancia, también es la más importante, exégesis libérrima de Karol Wojtyla.",

    "title": "Pinto Bean Pressure Wraps: A Novel Approach to Treating Digital Warts",
    "text": "Pinto Bean Pressure Wraps: A Novel Approach to Treating Digital Warts Identifying an optimal treatment method for verruca vulgaris can be a frustrating challenge for clinicians. We describe the use of a pinto bean pressure wrap to induce ischemic change in digital warts. This novel technique provides a low-cost, low-risk, and nearly pain-free home-based treatment option with response rates similar to those of other commonly employed methods. Practice Gap Verruca vulgaris is a common dermatologic challenge due to its high prevalence and tendency to recur following routinely employed destructive modalities (eg, cryotherapy, electrosurgery), which can incur a considerable amount of pain and some risk for scarring.1,2 Other treatment methods for warts such as topical salicylic acid preparations, topical immunotherapy, or intralesional allergen injections often require multiple treatment sessions.3,4 Furthermore, the financial burden of traditional wart treatment can be substantial.4 Better techniques are needed to improve the clinician’s approach to treating warts. We describe a home-based technique to treat common digital warts using pinto bean pressure wraps to induce ischemic changes in wart tissue with similar response rates to commonly used modalities. Technique Our technique utilizes a small, hard, convex object that is applied directly over the digital wart. A simple self-adhesive wrap is used to cover the object and maintain constant pressure on the wart overnight. We typically use a dried pinto bean (a variety of the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris) acquired from a local grocery store due to its ideal size, hard surface, and convex shape (Figure 1). The bean is taped in place directly overlying the wart and covered with a self-adhesive wrap overnight. The wrap is removed in the morning, and often no further treatment is needed. The ischemic wart tissue is allowed to slough spontaneously over 1 to 2 weeks. No wound care or dressing is necessary (Figure 2). Larger warts may require application of the pressure wraps for 2 to 3 additional nights. While most warts resolve with this technique, we have observed a recurrence rate similar to that for cryotherapy. Patients are advised that any recurrent warts can be re-treated monthly, if needed, until resolution. What to Use and How to Prepare—Any small, hard, convex object can be used for the pressure wrap; we also have used appropriately sized and shaped plastic shirt buttons with similar results. Home kits can be assembled in advance and provided to patients at their initial visit along with appropriate instructions (Figure 1A). Effects on the Skin and Distal Digit—Application of pressure wraps does not harm normal skin; however, care should be taken when the self-adherent wrap is applied so as not to induce ischemia of the distal digit. The wrap should be applied using gentle pressure with patients experiencing minimal discomfort from the overnight application. Indications—This pressure wrap technique can be employed on most digital warts, including periungual warts, which can be difficult to treat by other means. However, in our experience this technique is not effective for nondigital warts, likely due to the inability to maintain adequate pressure with the overlying dressing. Patients at risk for compromised digital perfusion, such as those with Raynaud phenomenon or systemic sclerosis, should not be treated with pressure wraps due to possible digital ischemia. Precautions—Patients should be advised that the pinto bean should only be used if dry and should not be ingested. The bean can be a choking hazard for small children, therefore appropriate precautions should be used. Allergic contact dermatitis to the materials used in this technique is possible, but we have never observed this. The pinto bean can be reused for future application as long as it remains dry and provides a hard convex surface. Practice Implications The probable mechanism of the ischemic changes to the wart tissue likely is the occlusion of tortuous blood vessels in the dermal papillae, which are intrinsic to wart tissue and absent in normal skin.1 This pressure-induced ischemic injury allows for selective destruction of the wart tissue with sparing of the normal skin. Our technique is fairly novel, although at least one report in the literature has described the use of a mechanical device to induce ischemic changes in skin tags.5 The use of pinto bean pressure wraps to induce ischemic change in digital warts provides a low-risk and nearly pain-free alternative to more expensive and invasive treatment methods. Moreover, this technique allows for a low-cost home-based therapy that can be repeated easily for other digital sites or if recurrence is noted.",

    "text": "Snowmobile enthusiasts may be excited to see the snow and cold has finally arrived. However, that certainly does not mean that snowmobile trails are suddenly ready to open. Shawn Flindall, the communications director with the North Bay Snowmobile Club says the only trails open in the province right now are located in the northern parts of the province in areas like Hearst and Kapuskasing. Despite the large dump of snow this week, he estimates the North Bay area requires another 30 to 40 centimetres of snow before the local snowmobile club can start grooming trails. \"It is a great start and it does allow our team to get out there and start packing trails, clearing brush, and fighting with swamps,\" said Flindall. \"However, we still need a lot of snow before we can get actual grooming equipment out there. With 6 or 8 inches of snow it is barely covering the rock, there is not enough snow to fill the holes, there is not enough snow to groom at all, but it has got to start somewhere and thank goodness it got started.\" However, the forecast this weekend could help speed up the process. \"We do anticipate some more snowfall this coming weekend which will help for sure and we have to keep in mind once we do get snow the trails have to be packed first and signed and then groomed a minimum of twice before they can be declared safe to be open,\" he said. \"So we are still a couple of weeks away before we will have anything open assuming things continue and we get this snowfall this weekend and more in the coming weeks but this is certainly a great start.\" Of course, Flindall always adds the caution piece. \"I know there are a lot of ice huts out on Callander Bay and area lakes but ice conditions are inconsistent at best right now there might be six inches right here, there may only be two inches 20 feet away,\" said Flindall. \"We just need to be aware that this is really early season and we need to be smart and cautious. On top of that, the snow that we did get a few days ago was a really nice, consistent heavy snow and that snow weight on the lakes has caused cracks in the ice and the water is coming up through those cracks so not only is there inconsistent ice conditions, but there is also a lot of slush on area lakes now as well. So we just need people to be smart and cautious for sure.\" And if all things work out, Flindall expects trails to start opening in the area within the next two weeks.",
