    "text": "受近期强降雨影响，重庆江津区李市镇双岔村遭遇洪水过境，村内部分街道及多处房屋受淹，洪水退去后遗留大量淤泥堆积，严重影响村民生活和出行。7月10日，重庆工程职业技术学院大数据与物联网学院“三下乡”学生团队刚好来到双岔村，在老师的带领下，同学们改变了原本的行程，领取装备加入到村民清淤的队伍中。从上午9点一直工作到下午3点左右，原本预计两天的清淤工作在学生们的帮助下已基本完成。\n学生们原本计划探访革命前辈故居，并在村里进行反诈宣讲和防溺水宣讲。当他们到达双岔村时，发现村民们正在进行清淤工作，现场一片忙碌。因为镇上和村里不少人参与了中山古镇的清淤工作，村里只有十几名村民在清淤，但洪峰过境留下的淤泥量很大，十几名村民完全忙不过来。“三下乡”团队主动找到村主任询问是否需要帮助，村主任得知有这么多大学生前来帮忙非常高兴。十几名师生迅速领取了胶靴、手套、铲子等工具，立即加入清淤工作中。带队老师江希表示，虽然这次活动与原计划不同，但她认为这是一堂非常好的劳动实践课。\n软件技术专业大一学生汤鑫懿来自黑龙江省大庆市，这是他第一次体验清淤工作。他感到很新奇，刚开始穿上胶靴走进淤泥时，体验与想象完全不同。淤泥很黏，铲起来也很费劲，只能一点点往前推。后来在村民的指导下，汤鑫懿逐渐熟练起来，能够更省力地挥动铁铲清除淤泥。清淤工作告一段落后，师生们开始动手制作午饭，由于村里停水，汤鑫懿和其他同学一起去水井打水，挑回厨房生火做饭。汤鑫懿表示整个过程非常难忘，一天的辛苦劳动不仅帮助了他人，也让他收获了满满的成就感。第二天，学生们将继续完成预定的反诈宣传和防溺水宣讲，相信这两天的经历会给他们留下深刻的印象。",

    "title": "Canucks, president Jim Rutherford agree to 3-year contract extension",
    "text": "Vancouver Canucks president of hockey operations Jim Rutherford has signed a three-year contract extension with the franchise, team chairman Francesco Aquilini said Friday. Rutherford, 74, has been the Canucks’ president since Dec. 9, 2021.\nWhat a difference a year makes.\nTwelve months ago the Canucks were listing toward the bottom of the standings, fans were cheering for a coach whose dismissal was a matter of time — both the probable date of his firing and his replacement was publicly known well ahead of time — and the club seemed like a complete mess on and off of the ice.\nAdvertisement\nFast forward to Friday, and the club’s fortunes could not possibly have gone through a more dramatic reversal.\nThe Canucks are perched atop the Pacific Division, with the most points amassed and the third-highest point percentage in the\nNHL. Five players are headed to the All-Star game. A new coach who has pressed all of the right buttons. The Canucks aren’t just playoff bound, they’ll likely have home ice and they’re the betting favorite to win the division.\nThis turnaround was driven — through intense scrutiny — but a series of clever bets by Rutherford. In Rick Tocchet, he landed the right head coach for this group. In\nFilip Hronek, we executed a high-risk, controversial trade that has amplified this club’s ability to win at the top of the lineup. In Carson Soucy, Ian Cole, Teddy Blueger and Pius Suter, Rutherford’s Canucks navigated free agency with expert discipline, fleshing out the depth of this roster.\nIt hasn’t been perfect —\nAndrei Kuzmenko’s extension is looking like an inconvenience given his second-year struggles — but nothing tends to be perfect in hockey management. The fact is, the hockey operations team Rutherford has built up has gone on an unholy heater, fundamentally altering the perception of this hockey club, and what they could achieve short term, both in the market and around the league.\nGiven the work restoring a sense of substantive hope for NHL hockey in this city, an extension for Rutherford is a no-brainer.\nOver the years the Canucks have struggled — at a level above hockey operations — to align the incentives of management with those of the organization as a whole.\nCoaches have been left to twist in the wind, working out the final season of their contracts. Executives have regularly felt the pressure to make win now moves, sometimes, seemingly more for self-preservation than for the benefit of the club long-term.\nAdvertisement\nIn this case, however, the club has taken care of its business well ahead of a crucial trade deadline.\nThis team hasn’t been a clear buyer in over a decade, but they are this year. With this extension in hand, Rutherford is incentivized to balance the short and long-term priorities of the hockey club, including charting a longer-term view if it’s called for, as opposed to being whatsoever put in a position where his decision-making ahead of a crucial deadline might reasonably be influenced by his contractual status.\nIn making this decision proactively and extending Rutherford now, the club got the timing of this one right.\nBefore joining the Canucks, Rutherford was the general manager of the\nPittsburgh Penguins from 2014 to 2021. During his tenure, the Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017. Rutherford resigned as Penguins GM on Jan. 27, 2021, citing personal reasons.\nRutherford was also general manager of the\nCarolina Hurricanes starting in June 1994. He helped lead the Hurricanes to its first Stanley Cup in franchise history in 2006.\nRequired reading\nDayal: All the ways I was wrong about the red-hot Canucks LeBrun: How does Canucks’ turnaround impact trade plans, Pettersson talks?

    "text": "A fired-up Pat Cummins bagged five wickets and 10 in the match to earn Australia a nail-biting 79-run win in the second Test. Australia captain Pat Cummins took 10 wickets in a masterclass of clutch bowling to end stout Pakistan resistance and lead his side to a 79-run victory on the fourth day of the second test, locking up the three-match series 2-0. Just when it looked like the Boxing Day test would go down to the wire on the final day, the paceman stepped in to remove Mohammad Rizwan, Pakistan’s last recognised batsman, and claim his 250th test wicket on Friday.

It was his second 10-wicket match haul in 57 tests and concluded a glorious year in which he led Australia to the World Test Championship, a 50-overs [World Cup triumph](/sports/2023/11/21/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-five-things-that-went-wrong-for-india) and the retention of [the Ashes](/news/2023/7/23/australia-retain-ashes-after-fourth-test-washout) in England. “Crazy year. Lots of cricket, lots of success on the field,” said Cummins, who was named Man of the Match. “I think we’re going to look back and remember 2023 as one of the special ones.” Set an imposing victory target of 317 runs after bowling Australia out for 262 before lunch, the tourists had put together a series of partnerships that frustrated the potent Australian attack. There were some home nerves when the last substantial stand of 57 between Rizwan (35) and Agha Salman (50) got the target under 100 runs but the match turned for good when Cummins separated the pair. Pakistan had threatened to take control of the match on several occasions over the first four days only to let the Australians off the hook. Fired by an innings of 96 from Mitchell Marsh, Australia had dragged themselves back from 16-4 after lunch on Thursday and resumed on 187-6 on a sunny morning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Wicketkeeper Alex Carey scored 52 to help extend the lead before he was trapped leg before by seamer Mir Hamza (4-32) to bring an end to the innings. Pakistan were always going to be up against it given the fact that only one team had successfully chased more than 300 runs in the fourth innings in 146 years of test matches at the MCG. The tourists were dismissed for 89 in the fourth innings when Australia won the first test by 360 runs in Perth and the early indications were that Melbourne would witness something similar. Dropped catches Abdullah Shafique, whose dropped slip catches in both innings proved so costly to Pakistan, departed for four before lunch when he lunged at a Mitchell Starc delivery and Usman Khawaja took the catch in the cordon. Cummins trapped Imam-Ul-Haq in front for 12 soon after the resumption but a 61-run partnership between Shan Masood and Babar Azam stalled Australia’s progress. Again, Cummins made the breakthrough by inducing Masood into an edge which Steve Smith claimed in the slips with the Pakistan captain on 60. Azam continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over but Australia’s bowlers remained patient as they targeted the top of his off stump and Josh Hazlewood got the reward when he nipped one back to bowl the Pakistan danger man for 41. Pakistan started putting together another partnership but it was worth only 16 runs when Starc (4-55) sent down a delivery that grew big on Saud Shakeel, who top-edged it behind to Carey for 24 with Pakistan still 155 runs from their target. Masood was remarkably upbeat considering his team came so close to ending a 15-match losing streak in Australia going back to 1995. “In terms of the bigger picture, this is the way we want to play test cricket,” said the 34-year-old, whose team will get another chance to snap that streak in the third test in Sydney next week. “Playing test cricket in these conditions, fighting until the end and where a result is possible for us. I think that’s something we have to take forward as a team.”",

    "text": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Young learners have new places to grow and thrive, as three new Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning open across the Appalachian Highlands of Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. As viewers and listeners tuned in to the first day of the annual Niswonger Children’s Network Radiothon, Ballad Health announced major steps towards fulfilling its commitment of opening up to 2,000 childcare slots across the region. New Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee; Lebanon, Virginia; and on the campus of East Tennessee State University are now open, with collective capacity to serve approximately 300 children. Each center serves Ballad Health team members and community members, and each accepts children who qualify for state childcare financial assistance in Tennessee and Virginia. “When we launched the Ballad Health Niswonger Children’s Network and our Strong Starts program, our intent was to integrate healthcare, education and community support and make the Appalachian Highlands the best place in the country to live, work and raise a family,” said Ballad Health Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Levine. “High-quality childcare not only helps ensure children are ready to learn by the time they enter school, but it helps parents and other caregivers pursue their own education and work goals with confidence. This benefits not only our team members, but the larger community as well.” In an internal survey, Ballad Health team members emphasized that dependable childcare is a critical factor when choosing a place to live and work. To support this need, Ballad Health’s Board of Directors voted in early 2022 to invest up to $37 million to improve access to childcare by opening up to 11 new centers throughout the region, in addition to the current programs run by Ballad Health in Johnson City and Elizabethton, and a third run on the campus of Bristol Regional Medical Center by the YMCA of Bristol. “We’re thrilled to open the first of our new childcare centers to begin serving families in our communities,” said Dr. Amy Doran, Ballad Health’s corporate director of early care and education. “Together, we will work to ensure children are kindergarten-ready with a best-in-class curriculum that supports early literacy, numeracy and science skills, in addition to social and emotional development.” All Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning will be open five days a week, from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., only closing on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. “Children, especially infants, toddlers and preschoolers, learn through play. It’s key to their social, emotional and critical thinking abilities,” said Dr. Seth Brown, chief medical officer for the Niswonger Children’s Network. “The curriculum at our childcare centers ensures that children aren’t just being looked after – they’re being set up for a lifetime of learning and growing, which helps prepare them for a brighter future of better health.” Now open: The Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee, and Lebanon, Virginia During the first day of the Radiothon, Ballad Health cut the ribbon on its Centers for Early Learning in Greeneville, Tennessee, and Lebanon, Virginia. “It’s been more than 10 years since we opened the doors of the first and only children’s hospital here in the Appalachian Highlands. It was a landmark moment for the region, and we continue to see returns on that investment every single day,” said Scott Niswonger, a Greeneville resident and chief benefactor for Niswonger Children’s Hospital and the Niswonger Children’s Network. “Investing in children’s well-being beyond the hospital is another milestone moment. The Ballad Health Strong Starts program, which supports families from birth to age 5, has thousands of participants region-wide, and the Strong Futures program here in Greenville supports hundreds of moms in addiction recovery and their children. Adding high-quality childcare to the mix locally is helping further wrap families in the type of support necessary for our children to learn and grow, and I am thrilled with Ballad Health’s continued commitment.\" Located on the campus of Tusculum University, the Center for Early Learning in Greeneville features six classrooms bordering a common area, as well as a playground that includes innovative equipment to encourage imaginative play. At full capacity, 92 children, from infants to age 5, can be served. In Lebanon, the Center for Early Learning is located less than three miles from Russell County Hospital, making it especially convenient for Ballad Health team members and their families. At full capacity, 70 children, from infants to age 5, can be served. “People with young families are a huge part of our team, and they’re crucial to our ability to provide care,” said Greta Morrison, administrator and chief nursing officer of Russell County Hospital. “The childcare crisis has a direct effect on the shortage of healthcare professionals and qualified professionals nationwide, and it is vital for everyone that there is adequate access to high quality childcare.” Ballad Health, East Tennessee State University unveil partnership to expand access to childcare and train future educators The Ballad Health and East Tennessee State University (ETSU) partnership will enhance ETSU’s current early childhood development curriculum, as students can complete their required observation hours at Ballad Health’s Centers for Early Learning, while developing hands-on experience under the guidance of licensed, experienced childcare professionals. “ETSU and Ballad health continue to partner to produce positive, generational change,” said Dr. Brian Noland, president of East Tennessee State University. “From the Strong BRAIN Institute – which promotes the awareness of best practices and empirical study of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) – to this newest childcare center on campus, where we will train the next generation of early childhood development professionals educating our children, our commitment to the region is always growing.” Once a licensing transfer is complete, ETSU’s current childcare center will become part of the Ballad Health Centers for Early Learning, and it will be expanded accommodate significantly more children. The expanded center will continue to house current Little Bucs and Head Start students, while offering more childcare openings for team members of Ballad Health and ETSU, as well as community members. At full capacity, at least 133 children, from infants to age 5, can be served. “Even with the addition of these centers, new centers slated to open in Norton, Kingsport and Abingdon later this year and Ballad Health’s future expansion efforts, the region still has a long way to go in terms of completely addressing the shortage of high-quality childcare,” Levine said. “We believe this effort is a model of how employers, government and community organizations can partner to tackle this challenge.” Registration information Families interested in enrolling their children in Ballad Health’s Early Learning Centers, or those who have questions, should fill out this form: https://redcap.link/ChildcareInterestForm or call 423-430-7632.
