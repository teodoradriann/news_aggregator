    "title": "Patti LaBelle’s Kids: Meet Her 5 Children – Hollywood Life",
    "text": "View gallery Image Credit: Michele Eve Sandberg/Shutterstock\nPatti LaBelle is a national treasure to her fans, but nobody loves the “Godmother of Soul” more than her children. The 79-year-old music icon is the proud mother of five kids, four of whom are adopted. Despite having a busy career since she rose to fame in the 1960s, Patti never wavered from being an extraordinary parent. After all these years, Patti has slowly taken a step back from performing, though she will make a special appearance during Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper ‘s New Year’s Eve Live special on CNN.\nBelow is everything you need to know about Patti’s five children.\nZuri Kye Edwards View this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Patti LaBelle (@mspattilabelle)\nZuri Kye Edwards , 50, is Patti’s only biological child. He was born on July 17, 1973. His father is Patti’s first and only husband, Armstead Edwards , whom she was married to from 1969 to 2000.\nIn 2015, Patti appeared on Oprah’s Master Class and opened up about how she struggled with postpartum depression after welcoming Zuri. “When Zuri was born, I cried all the time,” said Patti. “I was just … not feeling myself, the way I used to.” Patti even revealed that her friend, Laura , would help care for Zuri when she was struggling.\nOnce he was old enough, Zuri became Patti’s manager and he still holds that job today. Zuri is married to Lona Azami and together they have three children, Gia , Leyla , and Zuri Kye Jr . Patti proudly posts about her grandchildren on her Instagram .\nDodd-Stocker Edwards View this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Pump Dog (@pumpdogapparel)\nDodd-Stocker Edwards , 50, and his brother, Stanley Stocker-Edwards , were both adopted by Patti in 1973 while she was married to Armstead. They were reportedly Patti’s deceased neighbor’s children so she decided to take them in and raise them as her own. Dodd is the founder of PUMP Dog Performance Apparel in Philadelphia, according to his LinkedIn . He previously worked as the director of marketing at Global Cure CBD Wellness Center in Jupiter, Florida.\nStanley Stocker-Edwards As mentioned above, Stanley Stocker-Edwards , 60, and his brother Dodd were adopted by Patti after their parents died. Stanley works as an attorney at Covington and Burling LLP, in Washington D.C, according to his LinkedIn . Stanley attended Harvard Law School and briefly dated Michelle Obama , who was also a student there, according to the biography Michelle Obama: A Life .\nWilliam Holte William Holte , 61, and his sister, Stayce Holte , were both also adopted by Patti. Their mother was Patti’s younger sister, Jackie Holte, who died from brain cancer at the age of 43 in 1989. In December 2020, William made headlines for his connection to former Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate Dean Browning .\nStayce Holte View this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Patti LaBelle (@mspattilabelle)\nStayce Holte , 58, was adopted by Patti after her mother passed away. Stayce reportedly owns the Stacey Holte Love Conglomerate, an organization focused on unity amongst diverse people. She’s been in the spotlight the least out of Patti’s five kids.",

    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Dec 28, 2023 / 18:30 pm (CNA).\nThe Government Delegation (public administration) in Madrid mobilized approximately 20 riot police officers to prevent about 10 young people from praying the rosary in front of the Dator abortion clinic.\nOn Dec. 28, the feast of the Holy Innocents, the officers also arrested Dr. Jesús Poveda, who was staging a one-man sit-in at the doors of the Dator clinic.The doctor has spent close to 40 years helping mothers at risk of abortion.\nPoveda was thus faithful to what already constitutes a tradition of the pro-life movement in Spain by carrying out an act of passive resistance on only one day of the year, the feast of the Holy Innocents, while dedicating the remaining 364 to saving babies.\nIn the early hours of Thursday morning, unidentified people affixed posters to the Dator clinic\nwith explicit images of aborted babies with messages such as “He is a holy innocent” and “Are you going to look the other way?”\nAt 9 a.m. sharp, Poveda went to the doors of the abortion center and sat down on the ground in protest near the clinic doors. Shortly after, a group of young people from the\nPraying Is Not a Crime movement arrived at the scene with the intention of meditating on the luminous mysteries of the rosary.\nSeveral police officers automatically made them move a hundred meters (about 330 feet) away from the place, where on their knees and displaying a large wooden cross and an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, they began to pray the rosary.\nNext to them was a woman carrying a sign with the usual message of the 40 Days for Life initiative: “You are not alone, we can help you.”\nPhoto caption and credit: 40 Days for Life volunteer tries to pray for the end of abortion in Madrid in front of the police present. Credit: Nicolás de Cárdenas / ACI Prensa\nSome of the young people explained to ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, that the officers just told them that there was another event scheduled and notice given to the Government Delegation, and that was why they had to move away from the place. Pro-lifers claimed that, according to the law, they did not constitute a demonstration since there were fewer than 20 people in their group.\nWhile this was going on, a group of fewer than 10 feminists came onto the scene with the plan to demonstrate at the site, as they have done regularly for a few years.\nAround the place they displayed posters with slogans such as “keep your rosaries off our ovaries,” “feminist struggle = trans struggle,” and “I too aborted. So what!” while they used a loudspeaker to play music that could be heard all down the street.\nAt about 9:30 in the morning, the officers told Poveda to leave the place near the doors of the abortion clinic, which he refused to do, offering passive resistance. The police then transferred him to a patrol car in which he was taken to the police station.\nThroughout the hour that the pro-life volunteers were at the scene, the police didn’t allow them to freely move about and they were followed by several officers. At least one man was told by a police officer\nto empty his pockets, although he finally allowed him to continue without further consequences.\nAnother time, when two of the pro-life volunteers came to store material at the pro-life shelter located near the abortion business, several of the feminists made a beeline toward them carrying a banner. The police prevented them from approaching, warning the abortion advocates that\nthey were seeking “confrontation” with the young pro-life women.\nThis was not the only rosary planned for this day. At 6:30 p.m. several organizations were to gather at the site with the same intention. Also expected to attend was José Andrés Calderón, the young organizer of the public rosaries for the unity of Spain, which has been going on for almost 50 days.\nThis story\nwas first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

    "title": "Google Sell Chrome Browser, Pressure on Google increases, will the world’s most popular browser Chrome be sold? – google on pressure to sell chrome internet browser",
    "text": "Google may have to face⁣ a ‍big setback. In fact, pressure can be⁢ created by the US Department⁢ of Justice i.e. DOJ to save Google ⁢Chrome⁤ internet browser. A decision in this matter can be⁣ given by the court. According to Bloomberg’s report, Google Search‌ has ‌been ​accused of unfairly capturing ⁤the market. Also, a decision ⁤can be given to regulate Artificial Intelligence i.e. AI and Android operating ⁣system.\nGoogle gets big benefit from Chrome browser The​ court’s decision ⁤against ⁤ Google Chrome may cost the company heavily, ​because Chrome browser has a major share in Google’s earnings. The main source of income for Google Chrome is advertising. ‍Google Chrome is provided in​ Android operating system ​based smartphones along with laptops. Also, Google Chrome ⁢is given by default in iOS based iPhone also. However, controversy continues regarding this also.\nWhat‌ is Google Chrome‍ browser? If reports are to be believed, the court may give a decision to sell Google Chrome.⁤ Let us tell you that ⁣Google Chrome ​is a popular ‍search ⁤engine platform. It ‍is a free web⁢ browser. Google Chrome is developed⁣ by Google. It was ‍released ⁢for Microsoft Windows ⁤in the year ‌2008. Google Chrome is based on the open source⁢ Chromium web browser project.\nThere will be a big change in the search engine market If Judge Mehta of the US Department of Justice rules against the Google Chrome⁢ browser, then⁤ the Google Chrome browser can ⁣be ⁢sold ​to the Internet. Due to⁣ this, a big change can be seen⁤ in the search engine ‍market. After the entry of Artificial Intelligence, the search engine industry is going through a phase of⁣ major change.⁢ AI tool Gemini⁢ has been launched by Google. Also, it ‌is being updated rapidly day by day. Google ‌AI ⁣tools are being integrated into the Google Chrome browser.\nTitle: The Future of Google Chrome: ⁣An Interview with Tech Expert ⁣Dr. Carol Bennett\nEditor (Time.news): Good ‌morning, and ‌thank you for ⁣joining us ⁢today, Dr. Bennett. We’re excited to dive​ into the recent developments regarding Google and the potential⁢ implications for ‍one of the most widely used​ internet browsers, ⁤Google ⁣Chrome. To kick things⁣ off, can ‍you summarize the current ⁣situation regarding‍ the US Department of ⁤Justice’s actions against Google?\nDr.⁢ Carol Bennett (Tech‌ Expert): Good morning, and thank you for having me! Certainly. Recently, ⁢the​ US Department of Justice has shown increasing scrutiny towards Google, particularly focusing on allegations that Google Search has engaged in unfair practices that may stifle competition.‍ This has raised questions about the future of ‌their‌ products, especially ‌Google Chrome, as there could be ​substantial legal ramifications based on the case’s outcome.\nEditor: That’s ​quite⁤ the development. How exactly⁢ do ⁢the allegations against Google ⁤Search‌ tie into Chrome’s⁢ future?\nDr. Bennett: Great question! Google Search and Google Chrome are deeply interwoven. Google uses its ‍search engine to drive traffic to​ its⁢ browser, ⁣and ​it’s⁣ alleged that they might be using anti-competitive practices to fortify⁣ this link.⁤ If the‍ DOJ​ moves forward with its case and the courts ⁣decide against ​Google, ⁢we could see significant changes in how Chrome‍ operates, possibly impacting its features and market share.\nEditor: Given that Google ⁢Chrome is the most⁣ popular browser globally, what ⁢are the potential consequences for users if these allegations materialize into a formal ruling?\nDr. Bennett: If the court finds Google in violation of antitrust⁤ laws, it‍ could lead to a few⁤ outcomes. For one, they might be mandated to‌ alter their business practices, which‌ could include reducing their dominance in search and advertising. Users ⁤might ⁢see less integration between Google Search and ​Chrome, or even the introduction of ‌new competitors with‍ a fairer playing field, which could lead to more innovation and better privacy options.\nEditor: Interesting. So, it ⁤could be a⁢ double-edged sword,⁣ right? More competition might enhance‌ user choice but could also disrupt the status quo that ‍many are accustomed to.\nDr. ‍Bennett: ‍Precisely. Change‌ can ‍be⁤ beneficial but also unsettling. While competition could lead to newer and improved browsers with unique features and possibly​ better privacy measures, ⁣users might also face‍ a learning curve and need to adapt to‍ unfamiliar platforms. It’s essential to strike a balance between innovation and user convenience.\nEditor: With ⁤the digital landscape continually ​evolving, do you think there’s a broader‌ trend at play here beyond just Google and its products?\nDr. Bennett: Absolutely. What we’re witnessing ​with⁣ Google is ⁤part of a broader examination of Big Tech’s power and influence in our⁤ lives. Increased⁤ regulatory ⁤scrutiny is evident globally, with governments ​recognizing the ​need to protect consumer interests and ensure fair competition. This movement isn’t ⁢isolated to Google; similar ‍pressures are mounting on other tech giants, prompting many to rethink their business strategies.\nEditor: ​ What​ advice would you give to consumers as this​ situation⁣ unfolds? Should they ⁣be ​prepared for any potential changes in their‍ browser experience?\nDr. Bennett: I would recommend that consumers stay informed about these developments. ​They should‌ also explore alternative browsers, ​many of ‍which emphasize privacy and unique features, such as⁤ Mozilla⁣ Firefox or Brave. The landscape ‌might be shifting, ⁤and it’s always ‌good ⁣practice⁤ to be open-minded⁢ about options. It’s also a chance for consumers to express their‍ preferences through their choices, which can influence‍ the market.\nEditor: Thank you for your‍ insights, Dr. Bennett. This is undoubtedly a significant moment for Google and the⁤ tech ⁤industry. We appreciate⁢ you taking the time to share your expertise with us.\nDr. Bennett: Thank you for having me. I look forward to seeing how this situation unfolds‌ and⁣ its impact on both​ consumers and the ‍tech landscape as⁢ a whole.\nEditor: And we’ll ⁢be sure to‌ keep our readers updated on this developing story.‌ Thank you‍ again!",
