    "title": "Here’s why period cramps can hurt even more than a heart attack, according to science",
    "text": "- Doctors are finally starting to take women's period pain seriously.\n- Some doctors say that period cramps can be just as painful — or more painful — than a heart attack.\n- Severe period pain could be caused by an underlying condition, like endometriosis.\nMillions of women around the globe know that\nperiod cramps can be miserable. But doctors are finally starting to validate just how painful these camps can be.\nBack in 2016,\nQuartz published an article with a quote from reproductive health professor John Guillebaud, who told Quartz that patients have described cramp pain as \"almost as bad as having a heart attack.\"\nIn 2018, gynecologist\nDr. Jen Gunter, who writes a popular women's health blog, took that comparison one step further — she wrote that period cramps are often much more painful than heart attacks, which can often be quite mild.\n\"If you are waiting for terrible, excruciating chest pain to tell you that you are having a heart attack, well, you are going to miss the heart attack,\" Gunter wrote. \"Heart attacks often produce vague symptoms or mild pain, that is why many people ignore them … In addition, more than 40% of women have no pain with heart attacks. It would be dangerous for women to think that a heart attack should be at least as bad as their menstrual cramps.\"\nWhy are period cramps so painful?\nPrimary dysmenorrhea — the scientific term for painful period cramps — affects 50 to 90 percent of women, according to a 2019 article in\nJAMA Insights, half of whom describe the pain as moderate to severe. Despite that, the article said, painful camps are often \"often underdiagnosed, inadequately treated, and normalized even by patients themselves.\"\nThis cramping pain is caused by natural chemicals called prostaglandins, according to the\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which are made in the lining of the uterus. These chemicals cause the muscles and blood vessels of the uterus to contract, and can also lead to a stimulation in pain receptors. And during these period contractions, pressure on the uterus can be just as high as it is during the \"pushing\" stage of labor, Gunter wrote.\n\"So if you need an analogy to describe period pain,\" Gunter wrote, \"use labor or cutting your finger off without an anesthetic.\"\nSevere period pain isn't normal\nThat being said, while mild discomfort with periods is normal, severe pain is not.\nKhara Simpson, an assistant professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital,\nwas interviewed by Johns Hopkins Medicine and said that \"pain that stops a woman from working or going to school or other daily activities is not normal and should be evaluated by a gynecologist.\"\nSevere period pain could be a sign of an underlying health condition, like\nendometriosis or adenomyosis.

    "title": "Afghanistan may never get a solid narrative for its 20-year war | The National",
    "text": "Last month, the Afghanistan War Commission held its first public hearing since it was established by the US Congress in 2021. The commission’s first goal is essentially to produce, within the next two years, America’s official narrative of its longest-ever war. For America ’s harshest critics, that narrative will inevitably be too charitable. But Colin Jackson, one of the commission’s co-chairs, has said his team intends to be “unflinching” in the way it approaches the legions of diplomats, generals, politicians, civil servants and contractors who shaped US involvement in the war. “No one will look like an unblemished hero, and nobody will look like a complete scapegoat,” Mr Jackson told Politico last month. An unflinching narrative will be important if the commission is to achieve its second goal: to produce lessons for future American policymakers so that they avoid repeating the same mistakes. But there are two sides to every story. The other in this case, the Afghan side, will not be told fully for a long time – if ever. Three years on from the collapse of the Afghan republic there is no common understanding among Afghans about what exactly happened to them over the course of 20 years, why it happened, who was responsible and what their future looks like. Of course, if you are in Afghanistan this month – as the country celebrates two “independence days”, one from British suzerainty in 1919 and one from US/Nato occupation in 2021 – you will hear a story being told. But it is the Taliban’s story. It’s not entirely wrong. It focuses not on America’s mistakes, but on its crimes – proved and alleged. International media and western government inquiries have told many stories of Afghan civilians being abused or wrongfully killed by American soldiers. If you speak to villagers in large swathes of the country, you will hear many more. The propaganda banners that adorn every major city centre in Afghanistan nowadays remind the public of these crimes and cast the militants as the country’s liberators. But even this picture is painted in broad strokes rather than granular detail. Right now, there is no comprehensive effort by the Taliban administration to account for all the civilians killed during the war, the manner of their killing and or how some kind of justice can be pursued. That’s not surprising, of course, given the lack of resources available for such a task. Even if the Taliban were better resourced, however, pursuing justice or reparations for Afghan civilians – say, by giving access to legal NGOs to lobby for prosecutions in foreign courts or co-operating with the International Criminal Court – would be almost impossible, geopolitically. The US retains a lot of financial and security leverage over the Taliban, and the ICC has already said it won’t prosecute western forces for crimes in Afghanistan. It is also difficult ideologically; pursuing reparations in international tribunals would jar with the Taliban’s assertion that secular courts cannot deliver justice. But more to the point, the Taliban just don’t seem interested in this level of elucidation of Afghanistan’s recent history. It is enough that Afghans know they were mistreated by America and its “puppet regime”. The past is only useful insofar as it contributes to their greater project – the creation of a new national myth that fits around their authoritarian and theocratic system of governance. There is also a certain pragmatism in discouraging Afghans from dwelling too much on the war. The Taliban messaging to the Afghan public emphasises infrastructure projects and public security, and that – for now – has largely succeeded in uniting the Afghan public around that programme, widespread despair over the annulment of girls’ education rights notwithstanding. Putting ideas like national truth and reconciliation (and, by extension, old grievances) on the table could risk undoing that. It would be naive to mistake Afghan unity about the end of the war and the prioritisation of public order for true harmony and reconciliation. For Afghans looking for an alternative national storyline, the only other prominent source is the large group of exiled former officials and officers of the now-fallen Afghan republic. Like that of the Taliban, their narrative is not entirely wrong. The two most common refrains are that the Taliban brutalised civilians during the war and that the republic was a noble project undone by US betrayal. We know that the Taliban have killed many civilians, and we know (or, at least, I do) that there were many good people serving the republic. But I am not sure the republic will ever come to be remembered by most Afghans in Afghanistan as a high point in their history. Far too many of the former officials who pontificate on social media are suspected of corruption, and far too many of the former officers are accused of grisly war crimes. Many of them are now hosted by western governments and employed in western universities, so investigations are unlikely. Some of these exiles have tried to organise themselves and their mythology into so-called “resistance movements”. The biggest is the National Resistance Front (NRF), which is led by the 30-something Ahmad Massoud and his uncles. Its network of allies (they have regular meetings together) includes a group of warlords-turned-politicians and some former Afghan army officers. One of the warlords-turned-politicians is Rashid Dostum, who has been accused of such crimes as massacring 2,000 prisoners of war by locking them in shipping containers in the desert and arranging, during his tenure as vice president, for a political rival to be kidnapped and sexually assaulted. The NRF has campaigned for support and money in western capitals all summer, casting itself as a vestige of the republic and a defender of Afghan democracy and Afghan women. Mr Massoud’s new book describes his movement’s “relentless fight for human rights”, “a free and democratic Afghanistan” and promotion of “a moderate and rationalist Islam”. A few months ago, I asked one of his closest advisers how Afghans are supposed to believe any of that when the NRF’s friends include people like Mr Dostum. I also asked how the NRF can call the Taliban terrorists and war criminals without also calling for Mr Dostum’s prosecution. His answer to the first question was that the NRF must be practical: “Our priority is to get all these forces together to confront the common enemy [the Taliban].” In the same breath, he commented that the NRF would be open to being in a government with the Taliban if the latter “were only willing to talk”. To my second question about prosecuting Mr Dostum, he said: “Once Afghanistan is free, then we can make courts and investigate [him].” I revisit this conversation often in my mind to try to make sense of this story – that there can be an Afghanistan founded on human rights, but getting there must involve embracing alleged perpetrators. That everyone is an eternal enemy until they are a partner, and a partner until they are the enemy. It’s not that we should be surprised by this Machiavellianism. It’s that we should be disappointed. It just doesn’t seem like a story worth fighting for. And maybe that explains the reluctance among Afghans right now to try to form a narrative for the past 20 years – the lack of hunger for an Afghan version of Washington’s Afghanistan War Commission. From the American perspective, Afghanistan was a costly misadventure, but if it had gone right then the benefits were obvious: justice for 9/11, a new democracy in America’s image, greater prestige and further proof of the superiority of America’s vision for the world. That makes it likely that, however many mistakes (and potentially crimes) the commission uncovers, part of the American story will be a sigh for what could have been. From the Afghan perspective, however, it is a real challenge to try to wade through this generation-long war and find any potential upside. For Afghan society as a whole, no one narrative could have presented a happy ending.",

Estos factores incluyen la dosis (la cantidad), la duración (por cuanto tiempo) y la manera como entró en contacto con esta sustancia\", advierte la dependencia.\nEn pequeñas cantidades no es una sustancia nociva, pero usarlo en exceso y sin protección incrementa los efectos negativos por la exposición prolongada.\nSegún la ATSDR, las siguientes reacciones se han observado en seres humanos expuestos brevemente al cloro:\n- Irritación leve de la nariz.\n- Irritación de los ojos.\n- Irritación de la garganta.\n- Vómitos.\nOtra práctica que debe evitarse en la cocina es combinar cloro con otros líquidos para limpiar. “Cuando se mezcla blanqueador con otros líquidos para limpiar que contienen un ácido, por ejemplo, productos para limpiar el retrete, se puede liberar cloro gaseoso. Mezclar blanqueador con amoníaco también produce gases tóxicos, tales como cloramina”, mencionó.\nLEE: Cómo reducir el consumo de gasolina al manejar con las ventanas abiertas\nPor último, la ATSDR detalla que el cloro tiene un impacto ambiental negativo cuando se desecha por el drenaje, ya que sus residuos pueden llegar a los sistemas de agua, afectando la vida acuática.\n¿Qué tomar en cuenta para usar cloro (en bajas cantidades) en la cocina?\nMás que lavar los trastes utilizando cloro como reemplazo del jabón, la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de Estados Unidos sugiere emplearlo como un \"proceso extra\", mejor conocido como higienización.\nSi deseas eliminar las bacterias en tus utensilios de cocina, sigue estos pasos:\n- Lava los trastes con jabón y agua, retirando todos los restos de comida.\n- Enjuaga los restos de jabón bajo el agua corriente.\n- Prepara una solución con agua tibia y cloro. Por cada 4 litros de agua, agrega únicamente 2 cucharaditas de cloro.\n- Sumerge los platos en esta solución durante 2 minutos.\n- Saca los trastes y ponlos en una rejilla al aire libre.\nOjo: Si quedan residuos de cloro en tu vajilla, existe el peligro de intoxicación cuando entren en contacto con los alimentos. Así que enjuágalos bien.\nLEE: ¿Qué hacer si te sorprende un sismo mientras conduces?\nAdemás, recuerda que al trabajar con cloro debes utilizar accesorios de protección como: guantes, gafas y mascarilla, esto para evitar irritaciones en la piel, los ojos y las vías respiratorias.\nFinalmente, es importante realizar el lavado de los trastes en un área ventilada. Y recuerda que el proceso para enjuagarlos y la higienización son etapas separadas (no se llevan a cabo en el mismo espacio).\n* * * Mantente al día con las noticias, únete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp * * *https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaAf9Pu9hXF1EJ561i03\nML\nRecibe las últimas noticias en tu e-mail\nTodo lo que necesitas saber para comenzar tu día\nRegistrarse implica aceptar los Términos y Condiciones",

    "title": "“I promised the dead to take them home” — searcher Oleksii Yukov",
    "text": "“I promised the dead to take them home” — searcher Oleksii Yukov “There were parts of people's bodies lying there, torn apart. And some men, women, and kids were trampling on them. And they were all pulling copper, putting it in bags,” Oleksii Yukov recalls the picture he saw at the site where a Ukrainian helicopter shot down by terrorists crashed. He and his group went there to retrieve the bodies of the servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Shortly after that operation, the searcher was captured by Girkin's terrorists and almost killed. How did Oleksii become a searcher? Where and how does his group work? How does he feel the dead? How did his group help to return the bodies of those killed in Olenivka? And how does he communicate with Russians who are looking for the bodies of their relatives? Oleksii Yukov, head of the Platsdarm search group, told this to Serhii Hnezdilov, a soldier and host of hromadske, in a ++ podcast. About how he started searching for the dead I have been searching for the dead and missing for 24 years. When I was 12 years old, my older brother showed me what war looks like — here, near Sloviansk, near the village of Bohorodichne. We went into the forest, and what I saw surprised me: everything was green, but in some places, there were a lot of white spots. These spots were the bone remains of people and fragments of equipment from the Soviet and German armed forces. And the whole story we were told that all the soldiers of the Soviet army were buried in mass graves that just melted away before our eyes. I saw how many people were lying on the surface — cut up, dug up, thrown away. Skulls, helmets, and ammunition were scattered all over the forest. Since then, I have been searching for those who died in World War II. About the Platsdarm search group We were the first in Ukraine to start searching for the victims of the Anti-Terrorist Operation. Our city was occupied at the time, and on May 2, when a large-scale assault began and two helicopters went down near Sloviansk, we were the ones who took the dead. Then the Black Tulip was created. It included many search teams from all over Ukraine, including us. At that time, it was an evacuation of the dead, and now we also cooperate with the search groups “On the Shield”. We find the bodies of Russian soldiers, local residents who were tortured and killed, and Ukrainian soldiers who died defending Ukraine's independence. We see death every day. About the return of the bodies of those killed in Olenivka Many bodies of Russian soldiers were found in Lyman. The tragedy in Olenivka had already happened by then. Of course, they did not want to give our side the bodies for burial, because investigations and DNA examinations could establish that these were war crimes against prisoners. Various structures were involved in the exchange of the soldiers we found for the Ukrainian guys who remained in Olenivka: The General Staff, the Security Service of Ukraine… And we all managed to do it together. For me, the life of every person is the most important thing. And when our guys died there, it was shocking. We are different from those who kill us on our own land, where our parents are buried, and where our children are growing up. We remain human, even when we are killed based on our nationality, as Nazi Germany once did, almost a hundred years ago, when it killed Jews, Gypsies and Slavs. Now history has been twisted, and those who sat in the same trenches with our grandfathers and fought against Nazi Germany are fighting against us. We take the bodies of Russian soldiers and never mutilate them. For us and them, this is grief. It's terrible that some are fighting to remain slaves, while others are fighting to avoid becoming slaves. About funding and spirituality Currently, we work as volunteers and, of course, use our own funds. People help us: volunteers send us clothes and food. Unfortunately, we have no sponsors. When a person dies, he or she is left out of the life of a whole lot of people. People have forgotten what humanity is. The most important thing is to remember those who give their lives for the future, even for children who have not yet been born. I am inclined to paganism, to the native belief that the human soul and the body are the same. Until the body is buried by all religious canons, the soul will be nearby, tied to the body with shackles. We need to bring each of our guys home because they risked everything they had. We also risk our lives, but we know that we are doing it for a reason: to bring a person home so that they can be reborn so that their soul can calm down and be born again, become part of our society. We are losing the most important thing — humanity and the gene pool, and Russia is losing the same. We do not step over a single body — neither Russian nor Ukrainian soldier — we take them all. Every Russian soldier is one Ukrainian soldier in exchange. We are returning souls, not just bodies. It's time to realize that a nation is made up primarily of the spiritual. Who are we if we do not respect our dead? Then we are not a nation, then we are not a people, then we are not even human. I see how the military treats the Russian dead: they bury them, show us where they lie — no one fights with the dead. Death will never forgive insults, and you have to remember that. Unfortunately, the other side does not take this into account. Sometimes we pick up bodies in places that have been liberated to some extent but are still shelled occasionally. Sometimes we work 100-200 meters from enemy positions. The dead are on my side, and I will always be on the side of the dead because there is no one to stand up for them. About the equipment of the occupiers Kevlar inserts in the groin, knees, and back of the thighs protect the Russian soldier from shrapnel injuries. Our soldiers do not have such uniforms. We can throw millions of shells, but the war is won by the infantry. I saw this in my own experience when I took the bodies of the dead. Our guys had crossed this forest plantation with heavy losses, and here they were lying. And I realized that the soldier's inguinal artery was hit, and he could not help himself. We can talk about Russian SSh-40 helmets, still of the Soviet model, as they were modernized later. The inside of this helmet is protected by a thick layer of Kevlar. In addition to Kevlar, there is metal protection. We conducted a ballistic test — these helmets withstand ballistics quite well. Needless to say, the Russian military are dressed like bums. They learn the same way we do. But now we've stopped with the “everything will be given to us, we'll get everything” attitude, and we need to produce our own. We need to make sure that the soldier is protected: Kevlar should be inserted into the clothing to maximize the protection of soft tissues. About the culture of burial We have, as some people say, “dog monuments”, and the whole thing looks like a human dump. This is disrespectful to the dead. Monuments should be such that you can see that it is a soldier's grave. Right now, the flags at each grave are fluttering, and it's heartbreaking. It would be very cool if all the monuments were the same. You can put a Cossack cross, a layer of life, and a book of death on top. Not only the dead need this, but also we, and every generation that will come after us. We have one front for everyone. We have one war for everyone. And we have one grief for all. We like to put up Christmas trees and say: “This is for the military.” When some people come to cry near these portraits in the square, bend their knees, and others come to open the champagne, how will it look? This is disrespectful to the dead and their loved ones, this is hypocrisy. You can call the war “ATO” or “special military operation”, but it will still be a war. War is not divided by nationality or religion. War divides into the living and the dead. No one will ever win the war, because there are victims. Back in 2014, the mothers of the “DPR” fighters came here and begged us to help. We helped them because we are human beings, and all mothers have the same pain. For this mother, her life is over because this is the child she prayed for. Maybe the mother supported the war, maybe she didn't, but we can see the fact, that these are destroyed lives. The boy is lying there, it is not known what kind of person he was: good or bad. His chance to live, to be a human being, has already been taken away from him, because someone wanted to become an emperor, to revive the Soviet Union. But is it really worth so many lives? About the mood in Donetsk region Even those who supported the “DPR” and “LPR” are now fighting for Ukraine and say: “How could we fall for this?” Of course, some people will shit themselves, but they won't admit that they were wrong. New generations — even those younger than me — want to go back to the Soviet Union, which they have not seen and do not know. I lived here in the 90s. We spent the night in basements, it was very hard. People were killed and their future was taken away from them. We had to take it all in. I saw with my own eyes how it all began: how people were encouraged to go to “defend” Donbas and give weapons to anyone. It was wild: who to kill, which Banderites? I saw how people were trained to gather in a bunch of 100-200 people, how they were given rods and Molotov cocktails, how they drank vodka, and then got in buses and went to “defend” Sviatohirsk Lavra from the phantom right-wingers. About the tragedy in Karpivka When Ukrainian soldiers were killed on May 2 near Karpivka, our group was the first to go there to find the wounded. The town was occupied, and any of our actions could be qualified as treason. There were body parts and torn organs, and everyone was trampling on them — men, women, and minors. Someone was carrying some glass, someone was carrying iron, and someone was chopping down a helicopter with an ax. And I thought: “How people are changed by war, what kind of beasts they become.” We dismantled the first helicopter and loaded the fragments of the bodies of the dead guys. Then we got to the second one — it burned for three days, and we worked for three days, while the “DPR” mortars were shooting at us. No one knew we were working there, because, of course, we would have been immediately eliminated. We pulled out body fragments and bones right from the fire. My hands were burned. About a month later, one of the locals turned us in. About contusion We took the bodies in Semenivka. A man was lying on the road, the process of decay had already begun, there were maggots, and dogs had started to tear apart body parts. Maybe the man was just riding a bicycle — it was not clear. I thought: now I'll pick him up and drag him away quickly. But I couldn't pull him off the asphalt, he was stuck to it — it was so hot. I loosened it a little bit, then hooked a rope and started pulling it — I thought it was easier because everything was in this corpse jelly. Then I heard a whistle and I was thrown away, all in slow motion, like in some movie. Well, of course, contusion, brain damage. I got up and started working automatically: I had to pull that guy. I took the rope and pulled a little bit. I looked there, and there was only a piece of the body — it hit close by and this guy was torn apart. I came to the other half — one leg and a part of the pelvis — and took it and pulled it all. I was walking, throwing up on the go, blood coming out of my ears, wounded all over, scratched up — oops! A checkpoint of the DPR. And they told me: “Stop!” They wrapped me in wire and put me in a cell. I remember sitting there, he was asking me something, and I didn't understand what. I had never felt so bad, I was sitting there wishing I could die! I was shaking so much, I didn't understand what was happening. An ambulance arrived, loaded the corpse, and no one took me away, I was sitting there covered in blood, tied up. About being “in the basement” About a month after we took the boys from Karpivka, I was walking down the street and saw that there was no one there, because we usually have some drunks walking down the street, but here it was silent. Two cars pulled up, and men in uniform ran out, one wearing a Soviet pilot's cap with a star and a machine gun. For some reason, I felt so funny. Then the Russian said: “Stop! Lie down! Sit!” I said: “Figure out what I should do — stop or lie down…” The bolts were jerked, the cartridges flew out, and I started to get hysterical. They wrap my legs and arms with tape, throw me into a car, and drive 100 meters to the Security Service building. They pulled me out and took me to the basement, and there Lienka, Motorola's future wife, and some other girls were standing heroically with their guns. They took my wallet, divided the money among themselves, took my phone, and there were photos from this helicopter. Somebody in charge comes, and they read me an order from 1941 about the execution, about the betrayal of the Donetsk People's Republic, about betrayal of people, sabotage. I start laughing: what 1941, guys, are you crazy? And they hit me! A physical remark on the kidneys. They carried out a man in a diaper on a blanket, threw him near the steps, and one of the gunmen shot him dead. And then they said: “Let's take this guy out, we're going to finish him”. They take me to the Security Service building wall, and then our guys start shelling! There's a trench behind the gate, and they got into it. I thought to myself: our guys will hit me with shrapnel, it's a stupid way to die — I didn't do anything. I took two steps back and fell into this pit. The shelling ended, and they pulled me out of there. A car approached, they threw me in, and this dead man was lying there, covered in blood, smelling of feces and urine — I think he was tortured for a long time. The last number I called was of one of the “DPR” guys who let us through when we were taking the bodies of civilians out of Semenivka. They took my phone and dialed the last number: \"Hello, we've captured a saboteur”. And this guy told them: “What the f*ck are you bitches doing? Who did you f*cking catch, you morons, this is a searcher. He was picking up Soviet soldiers.” They said: “But we have an order, it's signed for elimination!” And the man said: “Who signed it?” “Strelkov”. I thought there was no chance, and about 15-20 minutes later Strelkov called: “I'm canceling the order, let him go. Let him go, we'll figure it out later.” They brought me back — I thought they were taking me to the old city cemetery — they opened the door and said: “Sorry, dude, we didn't know.” I got the hell out of there. Then I took my parents out of Sloviansk and returned myself.",

    "text": "(Reuters) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Thursday, granted a Clean Air Act permit to New York’s Empire Offshore Wind LLC. owned by Equinor.\nThe permit was given after an air quality analysis showed federal air quality standards would not be compromised during construction and operation of the project, the agency said.\n“When built, this project is expected to generate more than 2,000 megawatts of electrical power for New York State – enough to power as many as a million homes,” said Regional Administrator Lisa F. Garcia in the release.\nThe Empire Wind project will include two offshore wind farms, 816-MW Empire Wind 1 and 1,260-MW Empire Wind 2, located about 12 nautical miles (nm) south of Long Island, and about 17 nm east of Long Branch, New Jersey.\nTogether, its 147 turbines will be capable of producing renewable power for more than 700,000 homes each year, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimated.\nUnder the Clean Air Act, the EPA is tasked with approving state permitting plans to reduce pollution in areas with ozone pollution in the U.S. and ozone is a key component of smog, which can exacerbate asthma and other health concerns.\nThis project is one of the several offshore wind projects facing construction and financing cost blowouts that the troubled industry says would not be covered by existing power sales contracts, but it could be helped by a new auction planned by New York state.\n(Reporting by Daksh Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)",

    "text": "Tempête Gerrit : trois morts retrouvés dans un 4x4 tombé dans une rivière en Angleterre Trois hommes ont été retrouvés morts jeudi, piégés dans un véhicule retrouvé dans une rivière au nord de l’Angleterre, frappé comme d’autres régions du Royaume-Uni [par la tempête Gerrit](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1413140/article/2023-12-27/tempete-gerrit-le-nord-et-le-pas-de-calais-en-vigilance-jaune) qui a provoqué de fortes intempéries, a annoncé la police locale. Un autre homme qui avait tenté de les aider a été récupéré sain et sauf, a-t-elle précisé, ajoutant que les conditions météo locales « rendent la conduite automobile dangereuse ». 136 km/h en Écosse Plusieurs régions du Royaume-Uni, en particulier en Écosse et dans le nord de l’Angleterre, sont frappées depuis mercredi par la tempête Gerrit qui a entraîné d’importantes chutes de pluie et de neige, ainsi que des vents violents, avec notamment 136 km/h enregistrés dans l’Aberdeenshire en Écosse. Des vents tourbillonnants qualifiés de « tornade » par la police et provoqués par un orage supercellulaire, selon l’Agence nationale de météorologie (Met Office), ont également dévasté une centaine de maisons près de Manchester dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi, sans faire de blessé. Des milliers de logements restaient sans électricité jeudi après-midi en Écosse, tandis que les transports ferroviaire et aérien sont perturbés avec des trains et des vols annulés. Des automobilistes sont également restés plusieurs heures coincés dans leur véhicule à cause de la neige, et des routes ont été coupées par des chutes d’arbres sur la chaussée ou des inondations. Plus au sud, le transport de ferries [entre Douvres et la France](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1413609/article/2023-12-28/fortes-rafales-de-vent-calais-les-acces-aux-parcs-et-jardins-publics-sont-fermes) a également subi des retards mercredi à cause des vents forts soufflant sur la Manche, selon la compagnie DFDS.",
