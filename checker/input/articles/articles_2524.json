    "title": "France’s state weather forecasters on strike over automation errors",
    "text": "Workers at France’s official meteorological service have been on strike since February 5, with staff angry over working conditions and what they claim are poorly performing new automated tools. The employees of Météo France originally announced a strike running from February 5 to March 4 but have now extended this to run potentially into mid-April. Protests are not only over not only job and budget cuts in the state-run service – which falls under the Ministry of Ecological Transition – but the rise in the automation of weather forecasts. Strikers claim automation is resulting in reduced accuracy and cannot be rectified by real-life workers once errors are spotted. The forecasters see themselves as a service which can provide life-saving information in a country where the weather can change rapidly – only this month, seven people died in the south of France due to storms.

The number of full-time positions at Météo France fell by 23% between 2012 and 2022, according to French newspaper Libération. \"En dix ans, Météo France, établissement public à caractère administratif, a perdu plus de 20 % de ses effectifs. 3 409 postes en 2012, 2 581 en 2022. Une baisse drastique, délétère, ayant conduit à une pression accrue sur les équipes\"— Enjeux de l'environnement (@AMDucroux) [https://t.co/uJz525qOIc] [pic.twitter.com/XRZZVzO1UB] [March 19, 2024] This correlates to almost 1,000 jobs that have not been replaced, and this is worsening each year. In 2022, 95 people retired, which have still not been filled in the almost two years since the employees departed. Many new Météo France employees are also hired on a general contractual basis, whereas previously they were classed as civil servants, enjoying the strong rights associated with such a position. The number of observation centres has also fallen, from more than 100 to only 30, said Jérôme Lartisant, another union representative.

[https://t.co/ajGjCdHcz9] [March 7, 2024] In addition, despite there being fewer workers to cover the current workload, new major tasks are being handed over to the meteorologists. The new forest fire forecast, launched last summer, is the responsibility of Météo France, and runs through their website. Read more: [How does France's new wildfire risk forecast work? Where can I see it?](https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/French-news/How-does-France-s-new-wildfire-risk-forecast-work-Where-can-I-see-it) Concerns over automation accuracy More than the working conditions, however, employees are concerned about the implementation of automated software which predicts the weather. The new ‘Alpha’ tool from the \"Production Forecast Programme\" was introduced at the end of 2023, and workers are already concerned over the number of errors in the programme. Researchers are \"discouraged because their work is not put to good use by the automation at the end of the chain,” said Mr Giroux. Developers of the automation tool are also under pressure, as they see their work behind the scenes ruined by the way the software has to run. Mr Lartisant compared it to \"a nice round potato that becomes mashed potatoes once automated.” Mistakes have appeared at times where the forecasts should have been easier to predict, leaving workers worried about the summer, when many varying weather phenomena can appear in quick succession, such as heatwaves and summer storms. The workers are also taking the brunt of an increased number of complaints over the automated tool, which allows for little room for changes after the forecast has been made. “Some employees are even ashamed to say they work at Météo France,” said Mr Lartisant, who added people once took pride in working for such an important state service.

    "text": "A former CIA programmer was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday for leaking the US spy agency's most valuable hacking tools to WikiLeaks.Joshua Schulte, 35, was found guilty in 2022 of espionage and other charges in what the CIA called a \"digital Pearl Harbor\" -- the largest data breach in the history of the intelligence agency.\"Schulte betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen, heinous crimes of espionage in American history,\" US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.\"He caused untold damage to our national security in his quest for revenge against the CIA for its response to Schulte's security breaches while employed there.\"US District Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Schulte to 40 years in prison for espionage, computer hacking, contempt of court, making false statements to the FBI and child pornography.Schulte worked for the CIA's elite hacking unit from 2012 to 2016 when he quietly took cyber tools used to break into computer and technology systems, according to court documents.After quitting his job, he sent them to WikiLeaks, which began publishing the classified data in March 2017.\"Schulte's theft and disclosure immediately and profoundly damaged the CIA's ability to collect foreign intelligence against America's adversaries; placed CIA personnel, programs, and assets directly at risk; and cost the CIA hundreds of millions of dollars,\" prosecutors said.The leaked data included a collection of malware, viruses, trojans, and \"zero day\" exploits that, once leaked out, were available for use by foreign intelligence groups, hackers and cyber extortionists around the world, they said.Schulte was an early suspect after WikiLeaks began publishing the secrets, but was quietly charged in September 2017 only with having a large cache of child pornography on his computer.Charges related to the theft and transmission of national defense information, under the Espionage Act, were added later.In 2020, a jury convicted him on two lesser charges of lying and contempt of court, but it was hung on the other charges.In 2022, a new jury convicted Schulte on eight counts under the Espionage Act and one count of obstruction. He was convicted of child pornography charges last year.The leak spurred the US government to consider tough action against WikiLeaks, which then-CIA director Mike Pompeo called a \"hostile intelligence service.\"The US government then moved to indict WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on espionage charges. Assange is currently in Britain fighting extradition to the United States.© Copyright AFP 2023. All rights reserved.",

Knowledge Development Fund (BCKDF) for their work on topics including rare cancers, obesity and diabetes therapeutics and genome sequencing and analysis.\nOne of the UBC faculty of medicine-led projects received $6.84 million for research infrastructure to better understand how bodies manage obesity and diabetes. The goal of the project is to identify and leverage the body’s natural strengths to design therapies that correct the metabolic defects that cause obesity, diabetes and related health issues that are on the rise in B.C.\n“We welcome this B.C. Knowledge Development Fund support, which gives a vital boost to our team’s ongoing research into diabetes and obesity,” said Dr. Jim Johnson, UBC faculty of medicine professor and project lead. “This funding enhances our team’s ability to explore how the body regulates energy, opening up new treatment avenues for individuals affected by these serious chronic conditions.”\nThrough the BCKDF, the B.C. government awarded a total of $52.3 million to support infrastructure for 21 research projects at UBC as well as additional projects at the University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, University of the Fraser Valley and British Columbia Institute of Technology.\n“These amazing researchers at B.C.’s post-secondary institutions are finding solutions to help British Columbians live healthier and happier lives,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills. “This important research investment through the B.C. Knowledge Development Fund continues to support the expansion of critical research capabilities and discoveries at B.C. post-secondary institutions and showcases B.C.’s research excellence.”\nSince 2017, the BCKDF has awarded more than $288 million for 541 projects.\n“The B.C. Knowledge Development Fund investment in research infrastructure empowers UBC faculty, post-docs and students to drive research and to find solutions to some of our most urgent problems,” said Benoit-Antoine Bacon, UBC president and vice-chancellor. “Supporting critical work in renewable bioproducts, Indigenous archeology and biomedical innovations in areas such as diabetes treatment, RNA vaccines and genetic medicines, today’s investments reflect a breadth of research strengths across UBC.
