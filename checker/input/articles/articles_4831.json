    "text": "Bloomberg — Trabajadores en las fábricas de Boeing Co. ( [BA](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/quote/BA:UN/)) abandonaron sus puestos de trabajo por primera vez en 16 años después de que los miembros de su mayor sindicato votaran abrumadoramente a favor de rechazar una oferta salarial y declararse en huelga. Los miembros de la Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores Aeroespaciales, o IAM por sus siglas en inglés, el cual representa a 33.000 empleados de Boeing en la costa oeste de EE.UU., dejaron de trabajar a medianoche del viernes. Cientos de trabajadores formaron piquetes en la fábrica de Renton, a las afueras de Seattle, que fabrica el avión más vendido de Boeing, el 737 Max. Las acciones de Boeing caían hasta un 3,9% en las operaciones previas a la apertura del mercado este viernes. Y acumulan una baja de un 38% este año tras la crisis desencadenada por el desprendimiento de un panel de un 737 en pleno vuelo en enero.

Aunque ambas partes han expresado su deseo de volver a la mesa de negociación, la medida es otro dolor de cabeza para Boeing. La empresa ha sido golpeada por problemas de calidad tras la casi catástrofe de principios de año, la cual provocó investigaciones, disgustos entre sus clientes y una reorganización de la plana ejecutiva. “Esto ha tardado mucho en llegar, nuestros miembros han hablado alto y claro esta noche”, dijo Jon Holden, presidente del distrito 751 del IAM, ante una sala abarrotada de miembros del sindicato y medios de comunicación. “Está claro que había aspectos de este acuerdo que no eran suficientemente buenos”. Para cuando terminó de hablar, los cánticos de “huelga, huelga” eran ensordecedores. Seattle, sede histórica de Boeing, sigue siendo su mayor centro de fabricación. Además de los 737, la compañía fabrica los modelos 777 y 767 en sus instalaciones de Everett, al norte de la ciudad. Holden añadió que la oferta de Boeing no compensaba 16 años de estancamiento salarial, el aumento de los costos de la salud y la relocalización de miles de empleos sindicales. “Hay mucho en juego aquí para nuestros miembros, así que estoy orgulloso de ellos”, dijo. “Y vamos a volver a la mesa lo antes posible”.

Al declararse en huelga, los miembros del sindicato ignoraron llamados del nuevo CEO de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, quien ha prometido restablecer las relaciones laborales. Y desoyeron la recomendación de sus propios dirigentes sindicales de que aceptaran condiciones que incluían un aumento salarial garantizado del 25% en cuatro años. Aunque se trata de la mayor subida salarial de este tipo jamás ofrecida por el fabricante de aviones, los trabajadores habían esperado un aumento mucho mayor. Tampoco les gustó que la empresa tratara de eliminar un bono anual. Boeing se encuentra en una situación financiera difícil desde que el accidente del 5 de enero sacó a la luz las deficiencias en sus fábricas y obligó al fabricante de aviones a reducir la producción. Como resultado, la empresa ha estado perdiendo efectivo y su calificación crediticia está un escalón por encima del grado especulativo, ya que tiene que hacer frente a una pesada carga de deuda de US$45.000 millones. Cai von Rumohr, analista de TD Cowen, calcula que un paro de 50 días, en línea con huelgas anteriores, recortaría entre US$3.000 y US$3.500 millones del flujo de caja de Boeing.

    "text": "Why Did Twitch Commit Suicide?\nTwitch, a live streaming platform acquired by Amazon in 2014, has been a significant part of the gaming community for many years. It has provided a platform for gamers to connect, share their experiences, and showcase their skills to a vast audience. However, on June 22, 2022, the platform was shut down by Amazon, leaving millions of users wondering what happened. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind Twitch’s shutdown, also referred to as \"committing suicide.\"\nWhat Happened?\nOn June 22, 2022, Amazon announced that it was shutting down Twitch, citing \"strategic and business reasons.\" This sudden decision left many users in shock, with some speculating that the platform was struggling financially. According to reports, Twitch had been facing stiff competition from other live streaming platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook Gaming, which had been attracting many of Twitch’s top streamers.\nThe Rise and Fall of Twitch\nTwitch was launched in 2011 by Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, and it quickly gained popularity among gamers. By 2014, the platform had acquired over 55 million users, with many professional gamers and esports organizations using the platform to stream their matches and interact with fans. Twitch’s popularity continued to grow, with the platform becoming a major hub for the gaming community.\nFinancial Struggles\nDespite its popularity, Twitch was facing significant financial challenges. In 2020, the platform’s revenue dropped by 12%, with the company reporting a loss of $40 million. This decline was attributed to increased competition from other streaming platforms, as well as the rise of mobile gaming, which reduced the demand for desktop gaming.\nCompetition and Market Share\nTwitch’s market share had been declining steadily over the past few years. According to a report by Streamlabs, in 2021, Twitch’s market share had fallen to 40%, down from 60% in 2019. This decline was attributed to the rise of other platforms, such as YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming, which had been attracting many of Twitch’s top streamers.\nLack of Innovation\nAnother factor contributing to Twitch’s decline was the lack of innovation on the platform. Despite its early success, Twitch had not introduced any significant new features or updates to the platform in recent years. This lack of innovation had led to stagnation, with many users and streamers becoming frustrated with the platform’s lack of progress.\nUser Base Decline\nTwitch’s user base had also been declining over the past few years. According to a report by Streamlabs, in 2021, Twitch’s user base had fallen by 10% compared to the previous year. This decline was attributed to the rise of other platforms, as well as the lack of engagement on Twitch.\nAmazon’s Decision\nAmazon’s decision to shut down Twitch was reportedly made after the company conducted an internal review of the platform’s performance. According to reports, the review revealed that Twitch was struggling financially and was no longer a viable business for Amazon. As a result, the company decided to shut down the platform, citing \"strategic and business reasons.\"\nImpact on the Gaming Community\nThe shutdown of Twitch has had a significant impact on the gaming community. Many streamers and gamers are mourning the loss of the platform, which had become an integral part of their lives. The shutdown has also raised concerns about the future of live streaming, with many users worried about the fate of other platforms.\nConclusion\nTwitch’s shutdown has been a shock to the gaming community, with many users and streamers left wondering what happened. While the company had been facing financial struggles and declining market share, the shutdown was likely a result of a combination of factors, including the lack of innovation and the rise of competition. As the gaming community moves forward, it is likely that we will see a new wave of live streaming platforms emerge, offering new and innovative ways for gamers to connect and share their experiences.",

Gloucestershire is blessed with over 150,000 volunteers who give up countless hours to help others.\n“This sense of selflessness is something that King Charles holds close to his chest and, as someone who holds a Warrant from the King, I think it’s important for people to come together to celebrate the work of those who support their communities in such an important way.”\nThe Very Reverend Andrew Zihni, Dean of Gloucester, said: “Gloucester Cathedral recognises the importance of volunteers, as we ourselves rely on volunteers in their hundreds to help with the day-to-day operation of the Cathedral’s mission and outreach.\n“From helping in our community outreach programmes, to providing a warm welcome to worshippers and visitors, we could not fulfil our service to the city, county, diocese and more widely without our volunteers. We hope that this Service of Thanksgiving will bring joy and encouragement to all volunteers.”\nThe service takes place on Saturday 8 June, 4.30pm, at Gloucester Cathedral . There is no booking required to attend the service, and entry is free.",

    "text": "GOOD Friday this morning saw the Catholic faithful from the Rapopo Parish, Kokopo District celebrate the ‘Way of the Cross’.\nAlso known as the “Station of the Cross, this centuries-old celebration is recognized by Roman Catholics throughout the world and typically right before Easter.\nIn the usually quiet and serene locality of the Rapopo Parish, the community was up before 6 this morning to experience the pivotal moments from Jesus’ sentencing to his death to his burial.\nThe singing and prayers at each of the 14 stations served as powerful reminders while giving an opportunity for Christians alike to step into some of the most significant moments in human history.\nOn Good Friday, Catholics walk to 14 different stations and are invited to remember:\nStation 1\nPilate condemns Jesus to die.\nStation 2\nJesus accepts his cross\nStation 3\nJesus falls for the first time\nStation 4\nJesus sees his afflicted mother\nStation 5\nSimon helps Jesus carry the cross\nStation 6\nVeronica offers her veil to Jesus\nStation 7\nJesus falls the second time\nStation 8\nJesus speaks to the women\nStation 9\nJesus falls the third time\nStation 10\nJesus is stripped off his garments\nStation 11\nJesus is nailed to the cross\nStation 12\nJesus dies upon the cross\nStation 13\nJesus is taken down from the cross\nStation 14\nJesus is placed in the sepulcher",
