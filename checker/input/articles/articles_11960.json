    "text": "What to Expect from Xbox in 2024 Exclusives have started flowing and Activision-Blizzard is secured. Do we finally have positive momentum? The Xbox Series X and S are no longer new. Year 4 has begun, and thus we are officially into the middle portion of what we expect (courtesy of Microsoft’s lawyers [accidentally leaking](/xbox-series-s/206014/news/huge-microsoft-leak-reveals-plans-for-2028-next-gen-cloud-hybrid-xbox) the company’s own product roadmap) to be an eight-year console generation. So where do we stand? In [last year’s version of this piece](/ark-ii-1/193822/feature/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2023), I wrote, “2023 is a year of serious promise for Xbox, but it comes with an understandable sense of urgency from Xbox owners.” That urgency remains for 2024, following the mixed reception for Starfield, the most important launch for Xbox since, arguably, Halo 3 in 2007. But there’s even more reason to be optimistic coming out of 2023, as Hi-Fi Rush kicked the year off with a unique and award-nominated rhythm-action game that nobody saw coming; Microsoft survived [legal challenges](/news/198275/competition-and-markets-authority-blocks-xboxs-activision-blizzard-deal) from [multiple](/policy/193257/news/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-blizzard-acquisition) regulatory agencies and [closed](/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/207414/news/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal) its Activision-Blizzard-King acquisition; and Xbox Game Pass continued to [win](/remnant-from-the-ashes/209492/news/remnant-remnant-2-now-available-on-game-pass) and [win](/xbox-game-pass/192732/news/sony-claims-xbox-game-pass-has-reached-29-million-subscribers). And looking ahead to 2024, that positive momentum looks set to continue and, with any luck, snowball. Third-Party Exclusive Check-In Let’s start with what we know for sure, and that begins with a [Q1 release window](/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl/204742/news/stalker-2-to-debut-in-early-2024-according-to-developers-fact-sheet) for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the Xbox-exclusive AAA FPS sequel whose Ukrainian developers have had to [heroically contend](/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl/186717/news/stalker-2-studio-shares-a-moving-look-at-life-and-work-in-ukraine-right-now) with Russia’s invasion into their country. It’s the closest thing to a locked-in release date that Xbox has for 2024 as of now, though perhaps that will change soon if Microsoft holds another [Xbox Developer Direct](/forza-motorsport/194597/news/xbox-and-bethesda-developer-direct-january-2023-everything-announced) in January. Replaced is another [extremely promising third-party Xbox exclusive](/news/172944/replaced-is-a-cyberpunk-thriller-with-rad-25d-art-coming-to-xbox-e3-2021) that’s had development [understandably affected](/replaced/185792/news/stylish-cyberpunk-thriller-replaced-delayed-until-2023) by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as [high expectations](/replaced/205350/news/xbox-exclusive-replaced-delayed-at-this-point-we-cant-afford-to-release-a-sub-par-game) generated by its impressive showings thus far. The 2.5D cyberpunk-style, pixel-art action-adventure has evoked similarly positive vibes to another Xbox exclusive that’s been in the works for quite some time: The Last Night (which, sadly, still has no release date). Replaced, though, will almost certainly drop straight onto Xbox Game Pass sometime in 2024. Remember Contraband, the Xbox-exclusive open-world co-op game from Avalanche (the developers of Just Cause) that was [announced](/contraband-1/172935/news/contraband-announced-as-xbox-exclusive-open-world-game-by-xbox-game-studios-and-avalanche-e3-2021) at the 2021 Xbox Showcase? It hasn’t been seen or heard from since, and probably shouldn’t be counted on for 2024, barring a surprise re-reveal and quick road to launch. The same can be said for the [Vin Diesel-led](/ark-ii-1/197262/news/ark-2-delayed-again-to-2024-but-a-next-gen-version-of-the-first-game-is-out-in-august) Ark 2. Oh, and while it’s not exclusive, it’s worth noting that Square Enix will ship a [highly anticipated RPG](/visions-of-mana/209862/news/square-enix-reveals-visions-of-mana-new-game-in-the-mana-series-game-awards-2023) in 2024 that hits Xbox the same day as PlayStation: Visions of Mana, the next in the beloved roleplaying series started decades ago by Secret of Mana. The Games Are Coming from Inside the House! In terms of Microsoft’s internal owned-and-operated studios, Team Xbox has learned the hard way that buying studios isn’t quite the fast-forward button on getting exclusive games to your platform that it had hoped. Still, that faucet is flowing now, with the Xbox Series X’s [first officially announced game](/action-ironside/156126/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-announced-for-xbox-series-x), Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, finally nearing the finish line and set to release sometime in 2024. It’s powered by Unreal Engine 5, and while it won’t be the first UE5 game to ship on Xbox Series, it could easily end up being the prettiest, most dramatic, and most emotional next-gen showpiece yet. Avowed is also set to be released in 2024, and Obsidian’s impressive track record suggests it’s going to be quite good. While it isn’t The Elder Scrolls 6 and it [isn’t trying to be](/avowed/200583/news/avowed-size-and-scope-closer-to-the-outer-worlds-than-skyrims), it is nevertheless a first-person fantasy RPG from a studio on a serious hot streak. Since Microsoft acquired the Orange County RPG experts, the following bangers have shipped: The Outer Worlds (a multiplatform release under an arrangement made with Take-Two’s Private Division label prior to Microsoft’s acquisition, but the in-development [sequel](/the-outer-worlds/172970/news/the-outer-worlds-2-announced-e3-2021) will only ship on Xbox platforms), Pentiment, and Grounded. Avowed is set in Obsidian’s own Pillars of Eternity RPG universe, and it guarantees that Xbox fans will get at least one big exclusive role-playing game in 2024. Finally, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will follow up the highly acclaimed 2021 entry to once again bring your aviation dreams a bit closer to reality. Ask Again Later And while nothing else is confirmed for 2024 as of this writing, a host of exciting possibilities remain. The talented team at MachineGames set Wolfenstein aside to work on an Indiana Jones project, which is being executive-produced by renowned Bethesda game director Todd Howard. It was [announced with a vague CGI teaser](/news/167652/indiana-jones-game-coming-from-bethesda-and-lucasfilm-games) a full three years ago, and it seems like 2024 will be the year we finally [hear more about it](/indiana-jones/205405/news/todd-howard-teases-potential-reveal-and-details-for-bethesdas-indiana-jones-game). Might it also ship in the coming year? It’s definitely possible, particularly when you take into account the fact that MachineGames’s last full-game project, Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, was released way back in 2017. Fingers crossed we’ll be cracking Indy’s whip sometime in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, it seems that Bethesda didn’t just make a deal with Disney for one game. Arkane’s Lyon division will be following up 2021’s outstanding Deathloop with Marvel’s Blade, which was [just announced](/news/209881/new-blade-game-announced-from-deathloop-developers-game-awards-2023) at this year’s Game Awards. It’s an unexpected studio-to-license pairing, for sure, and let’s hope it enjoys a better fate than the [poor-selling critical darling](https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1622707723480563721?s=20) Marvel’s Midnight Suns from Firaxis. Fingers crossed we'll be cracking Indiana Jones' whip sometime in the next 12 months. I think we’re unlikely to hear anything from inXile’s steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution and Compulsion Games’s bayou-based action-adventure South of Midnight, seeing as how both were [just](/news/200444/wasteland-developer-inxile-unveils-clockwork-revolution) [announced](/news/200426/south-of-midnight-new-game-from-we-happy-few-developer-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase) at Xbox’s [2023 Summer Showcase](/news/200400/xbox-games-showcase-2023-everything-announced). Same for Hideo Kojima’s OD project, which was [officially revealed](/hideo-kojima-xbox-project/209901/news/hideo-kojima-officially-reveals-od-project-with-xbox-studios-and-jordan-peele-game-awards-2023) at The Game Awards. And while Fable feels like the biggest game in Xbox’s first-party portfolio not named The Elder Scrolls 6, it too still seems like we’re going to have to wait a while to play it. And then there are three announced Xbox exclusives that have each reportedly suffered significant speed bumps in the course of development: Rare’s Everwild, Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3, and [The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics’](/perfect-dark-next-gen/201273/news/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away) Perfect Dark. None are remotely likely to see the light of day in 2024, but perhaps we’ll get a new trailer or gameplay video from at least one of them this year. More optimistically, we stand a very good chance of at least three major first-party Xbox games getting announced between now and 2025: Gears of War 6, the rumored Doom: Year Zero, and the next game from Psychonauts 2 developer Double Fine. After 2019’s [stellar](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/13/gears-5-review) Gears 5 (which has a key story point that needs resolving), The Coalition [told us](/news/171821/gears-of-war-series-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-for-multiple-new-projects) in 2021 that they were moving over to Unreal Engine 5 (unsurprisingly) and that they wouldn’t be making any announcements for quite some time. It’s been three years since then; it’s time for Gears 6 to become official, and I think it’ll happen at the 2024 Xbox Summer Showcase. The next first-person shooter from id Software, meanwhile (note: while we don’t know a thing about id’s next game, I will print out this article and eat it if it’s anything but an FPS), looks like it might be a Doom prequel, given the [leaked](/fallout-3/206013/news/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document) Doom: Year Zero title. This is to say nothing of some of the other projects from that apparently old document, such as a remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, a third Dishonored game, and more. As for Double Fine, they earned [significant critical acclaim](/deathloop/179766/news/the-game-awards-2021-winners-the-full-list) for Psychonauts 2, and given when that game came out – August of 2021 – there’s a reasonable chance that Tim Schafer and the talented team at the San Francisco-based studio tell us what they’ve been up to since. Hardware and Services in 2024 Here’s a fun reminder: every single game mentioned above will be released on Xbox Game Pass at launch. Microsoft’s game subscription service continues to be an incredible value for gamers, and 2024 should do nothing to change that – particularly if and (more likely) when Activision and Blizzard games start going into Game Pass. Diablo 4 on Game Pass? Likely to happen in 2024. Pre-Modern Warfare 3 (2023) Call of Duty games on Game Pass? Fair chance it happens in 2024. The next major Call of Duty entry, likely called Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War if the leaks are accurate, day one on Game Pass next Fall? It’s possible! More certainly, we can expect Sony’s own outstanding baseball sim, MLB The Show 24, to once again hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. So too does Microsoft have a number of other third-party games teed up to debut on the service, such as Flintlock: Siege of Dawn, Persona 3 Reload, 33 Immortals, Dungeons of Hinterberg, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and others. As for the aforementioned Xbox product roadmap leak, if it holds true, we can expect an Xbox Series X refresh in the Fall, codenamed Brooklin. This will include not just a smaller, rounder Series X – one with 2TB of built-in storage but without an optical disc drive, at that – but it will also include a new Xbox controller that includes haptic feedback and a rechargeable battery. A Series S refresh, codenamed Ellewood, may also be on the way, and if so it will launch first in the Summer, followed by the Brooklin in the Fall. Buckle Up With a ton of new studios and franchises in the fold courtesy of the Activision-Blizzard acquisition, a steady stream of first- and third-party games firing from the Game Pass cannons, and a ton more big games still further out on the horizon, the future remains brighter than ever for Xbox gamers. This year, though, more of that promising future should start to become the fantastic present. Onward and upward, my friends.

    "text": "El rol de Promigas es fundamental para el país . Hoy, la empresa cuenta con 23 compañías dedicadas al transporte y distribución de gas natural, regasificación de GNL, distribución de energía eléctrica y servicios integrados para la industria.Sin embargo, la compañía es consciente que todas las acciones que desarrollan en la cadena de valor pueden impactar en la calidad de vida de las comunidades de su área de influencia y la comunidad en general.Por eso su interés en consolidar iniciativas que respondan a ese compromiso que define su identidad y se refleja en todas las actuaciones e interacciones con sus grupos de interés.Todo esto se evidencia en una inversión social estratégica de 44.685 millones de pesos, con la que le apuesta a dejar una Huella Social positiva en las comunidades de Colombia y Perú, además de contribuir a la reducción de la pobreza energética y, a través de su fundación, al desarrollo sostenible de la población vulnerable.“Según el Índice Multidimensional de Pobreza Energética (IMPE), el 18,5 por ciento de la población colombiana se encuentra en situación de pobreza energética y para Promigas es fundamental trazar una hoja de ruta hacia la reducción de este indicador”, explica Juan Manuel Rojas, presidente de Promigas.Así, a través de su Huella Social, Promigas ha tenido avances importantes en varios frentes: que más personas dejen de cocinar con leña, acceso a financiación no bancaria para que la población adquiera bienes, y ejecución de estrategias innovadoras con el fin de que las comunidades accedan a fuentes energéticas de calidad.Cuatro dimensiones básicasEstos esfuerzos por el impacto social se enmarcan en cuatro dimensiones que incluyen: Gas y Energía Eléctrica (core del negocio), Negocios Inclusivos (Brilla), Talento Humano y Cadena de Proveedores e Inversión Social y Estratégica.Precisamente, en el marco de la cuarta dimensión de la Huella Social, la Fundación Promigas, a través de su Inversión Social de Alto Impacto, lidera cuatros programas que generan un cambio sostenido al brindar herramientas para desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades de la población vulnerable en los territorios donde operan Promigas y sus empresas.Durante 2023, con Más Empleo Juvenil, Más Emprendimiento, Comunidades Más Productivas y Territorios Más Sostenibles impactó de manera directa la vida de 10.310 personas en condición de vulnerabilidad en 11 departamentos del país.“Mi experiencia fue muy emocionante y estoy feliz de haber sido parte de este proceso que me ayudó a fortalecer mi inglés, enfocado en las necesidades del mercado laboral. Me encuentro muy contento porque esto me abre las puertas de mi futuro profesional”, asegura Alejandro Londoño, beneficiario de la iniciativa Territorios O-Key, que busca impulsar la empleabilidad juvenil en el sector BPO mediante el aprendizaje de este segundo idioma.Más Empleo JuvenilEste programa busca elevar el acceso al mercado laboral de jóvenes en condiciones de vulnerabilidad mediante una formación pertinente que entienda las necesidades del mercado. Además, la Fundación Promigas tiene el objetivo de generar competencias técnicas laborales básicas y específicas teniendo en cuenta el tejido productivo de la zona de intervención, así como el fortalecimiento de habilidades socioemocionales necesarias para su futuro laboral.Hoy este programa ha formado a más de 4.000 jóvenes de cara a su inserción laboral, con salarios promedios entre 1.2 y 2.2 millones de pesos en los sectores de gastronomía, tecnología, inglés para BPO, administración y energético.Más EmprendimientoEste programa promueve el desarrollo de nuevos negocios, mediante la formación de capacidades en los emprendedores para su inserción en el ecosistema del emprendimiento. Hasta la fecha ha impulsado las ventas de más de 1.000 unidades productivas en un 60 por ciento.Comunidades Más ProductivasEste programa impulsa unidades y/o encadenamientos productivos para generar oportunidades de ingreso y bienestar a productores rurales y urbanos, y dinamizar los sistemas económicos territoriales.Las unidades productivas beneficiarias de ‘Comunidades más productivas’ han incrementado, en promedio, la producción de alimentos en un ciento por ciento y sus ventas en 200 por ciento.Territorios Más SosteniblesEste programa impulsa iniciativas ligadas al uso productivo de recursos y servicios ecosistémicos, para generar oportunidades de ingreso y bienestar para productores rurales y urbanos.Con ‘Territorios más sostenibles’ se ha logrado plantar más de 70.000 árboles, a través de más de 100 viveros fortalecidos.Lo retos continúanPara 2024, Promigas y sus empresas, con una meta de Inversión Social Estratégica de 53.440 millones de pesos y a través de su Huella Social, buscarán que entre 18.000 y 20.000 personas puedan salir de la condición de pobreza energética, y contribuir al desarrollo sostenible de la población más vulnerable a través de su fundación y los cuatro programas distintivos.

    "title": "30 Soldiers in One Operation - Resistance Roundup - Day 104",
    "text": "This would have not happened if it were not for the strong Palestinian Resistance throughout Gaza. According to NBC News, the Biden Administration is [beginning](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/frustrations-biden-israeli-pm-netanyahu-mount-rcna134263) to recognize that there is no military solution to the Israeli war on Gaza. The realization arrived belatedly for tens of thousands of Palestinians who have lost their lives or were wounded in the Israeli quest of destroying the Resistance, in fact, all of Gaza. But the US shift would have not happened if it were not for the stiff, in fact powerful, Palestinian Resistance throughout the Gaza Strip, even in the northern region, which Israel had allegedly ‘pacified’ weeks ago. On today’s roundup of the Resistance operations on the 104th day of the Israeli war, Al-Qassam Brigades speak of killing and wounding over 40 Israeli soldiers in various fighting axes. Below are the latest statements by the two main Resistance forces in Gaza, and the Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah. The statements below were communicated via their Telegram channels and are published here in their original form. Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) “After our fighters returned from the areas of clashes, they confirmed that a Zionist force stationed in a house was targeted with an anti-fortification TBG shell, killing 5 of its members, east of the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip. “After returning from the combat fronts, our fighters confirmed the explosion of a house that was previously rigged with several explosive devices targeting a Zionist infantry force consisting of 30 soldiers. The soldiers were lured into the house, and as soon as they entered, the house was completely detonated, resulting in deaths and injuries among them in Bani Suheila, east of Khan Yunis city in the southern Gaza Strip. “Al-Qassam fighters were able to target two Merkava tanks and a D9 military bulldozer with Al-Yassin 105 shells in the Abasan area, east of the city of Khan Yunis. “Al-Qassam Brigades target a Zionist troop carrier at the Al-Khalil military site, east of Al-Tuffah neighborhood, with an Al-Yassin 105 shell. “Al-Qassam fighters targeted a Zionist troop carrier on Jabal al-Rayyis, east of Al-Tuffah neighborhood, with an Al-Yassin 105 shell, and clashed with soldiers who were around it, leaving them dead and wounded. In this just-released video, Al-Qassam fighters are seen targeting an Israeli force holed up inside a building in Jabaliya al-Balad, northern Gaza Strip.

    "text": "每经编辑｜何小桃\n7月2日，据福建电视台第一帮帮团报道，知名汉堡品牌 牛约堡 福建厦门有门店后厨，多种食材裸露，多只蟑螂到处爬行。\n7月2日晚上，“厦门市场监管”公众号发布情况通报：\n7月2日，媒体曝光了“牛约堡”食品安全问题，思明区和湖里区市场监管局立即行动，对“牛约堡”禾祥西店、林后店开展现场检查。执法人员重点对食品原料储存、加工制作环境等进行检查，对发现的食品安全相关违法行为当场立案。 目前两家门店均已停止营业。 同时，厦门市市场监管局对全市其他“牛约堡”门店开展全覆盖检查，深入排查食品安全风险隐患。不符合食品安全规范的门店均已暂停营业、自查整改。\n下一步，市场监管部门将按照“四个最严”的要求，进一步开展案件调查，对危害食品安全的违法行为，坚决依法从快从严查处。感谢社会各界的监督！\n值得注意的是， 牛约堡 近年扩张迅速，在全国拥有上千家门店，有产品号称“麦当劳平替”，颇受市场欢迎。\n后厨蟑螂横行\n店员：“繁衍太快”\n根据报道，牛约堡厦门林后店，外卖单量超2000单。记者探访后厨时注意到，满装着牛肉饼的铁桶就敞口放在地面上、面包胚裸露放在烤箱上晾晒，地面上不少蟑螂爬动。\n过道处的两箱未开封面包胚箱体标签显示，这批面包胚生产日期为2025年6月1日，标注“常温保质期10天”，而当日已为6月13日。\n此外，牛约堡禾祥西路店也有类似情况，该门店在多个外卖平台月销量均超1000单，号称“堂食餐厅”，但记者在现场仅注意到一个极小的桌台和两张椅子。操作区汉堡烤台及设备表面油污和食物残渣遍布，部分区域污垢已凝结成块，冰箱内火腿、牛肉饼裸露未密封。罐头架上，四五只蟑螂在爬行，甚至装调料的碗中也有一只蟑螂。\n对此，店员仅回应：“我知道，有做消杀，但蟑螂繁殖太快。”\n网友表示：\n天塌了！正在吃\ny茉莉：正在吃牛约堡，哭了。\n芷若心仪：天塌了，最近经常点牛约堡。\n人民的公仆： 但是，牛约堡我是真的爱吃。\nlucky小虹： 以前很爱吃他们家凤梨堡，两年前路过一次线下门店，外面看着就很脏乱差，我就再也没点过。\n城南的女疯纸： 亲测牛约堡吃完直接肠胃炎上吐下泻。\n蘑菇大盗_ ： 太可怕了，这要严查。\n创始人曾称以外卖为主堂食为辅\n公开信息显示，牛约堡创立于2018年，主打手作牛肉汉堡，同时还有鸡肉、鱼肉和素食等各类汉堡以及炸鸡、薯条、小吃及饮品等。目前，牛约堡年销量超4700万个，全国155座城市拥有1800余家门店。\n这次并不是牛约堡第一次被曝有食品卫生问题，据南方都市报去年9月报道，记者走访了广州4家牛约堡门店，发现基本以外卖为主，通常开在城中村的巷子里，一些门店环境比较简陋，卫生状况堪忧。\n图为牛约堡广州海珠某门店，藏在这条巷子里 图片来源：南方都市报\n此前，在黑猫投诉 【下载黑猫投诉客户端】 平台上也有多起关于牛约堡食品安全问题的投诉及相关的差评：“在外卖的炸鸡腿里吃到了生肉。”“吃完不到一个小时肚子疼，开始拉肚子”。\n风波发酵后，牛约堡曾2024年9月5日发布数条微博回应食品卫生问题。该品牌 承认部分加盟店在管理和服务上存在不足， 并表示已在改进。网络上对于其门店环境是食品卫生的指责大都来自于过去旧店和极个别情况， 牛约堡 正积极投入到老店的整改或迁址工作中，从最多时的400多家脏乱差到如今剩下60余家。\n窄门餐眼显示，牛约堡的人均消费接近30元，略低于肯德基、麦当劳，但比华莱士、塔斯汀等要贵上近10块。 牛约堡推出的一款安格斯牛肉堡被称“麦当劳平替”，是最受欢迎的菜品之一。 公开 宣介资料显示，牛约堡4700万+牛肉汉堡的成绩，远超同类品牌30%以上；门店存活率远超行业均量，稳居汉堡加盟十大品牌第一梯队。\n牛约堡在国内的加盟扩张之势的确迅猛，从2021年到2024年，牛约堡每年新开门店数量都超过300家。开年以来，牛约堡已在全国开出超200家门店。\n加盟 牛约堡门店是一门好生意吗？ 蓝鲸新闻记者致电牛约堡招商客服，工作人员表示，加盟合作费需要8.8万元，包含设备、员工培训等费用。因为目前加盟比较火热，培训已排至8月中旬。\n一家牛约堡加盟的启动费用约20余万，回本周期大概在10-12个月，月盈利普遍在2-3万元。招商人员表示，牛约堡线下门店的毛利率一般在60-65%，比如售价21块的牛肉堡，成本可能在7.3元左右。线上方面则要结合不同外卖平台的扣点计算，毛利稍低一些。\n牛约堡创始人王京海曾表示， 在品牌创立的初期牛约堡的发展重心就一直放在外卖上，以外卖为主堂食为辅。 招商人员透露，线上业务占比约80%。\n编辑 | 何小桃 杜恒峰",

    "text": "This story originally appeared on Spotlight PA.\nPennsylvania state legislators earlier this month approved a study of how the 911 system can better assist people experiencing a mental health crisis, a measure championed by the family of Christian Hall ahead of the three-year anniversary of his death.\nThe study seeks ways for emergency dispatchers operating the 911 system to send crisis responders, not police, to someone who calls to report a mental health emergency.\nOn Dec. 30, 2020, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper shot and killed Christian Hall after the 19-year-old called 911 to report a potential suicide in progress. Before the shooting, police arrived to find Hall standing on a bridge and holding what they later determined to be a pellet gun. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor\nAuthorities at the time said the shooting was justified because the troopers feared for their lives. A Monroe County prosecutor called it a “classic suicide by cop scenario.” But a 2021 investigation by Spotlight PA and NBC News found Hall had his hands in the air for 14 seconds before police shot and killed him.\nAt a vigil held Dec. 17 in Christian’s honor, Gareth and Fe Hall mourned their son and spoke in support of the expanded mental health resources they believe could have saved his life.\n“Bullets should not be the only resort,” Fe Hall said at the vigil. “Bullets should not be the first resort.”\nThe General Assembly funded the new study as part of the recent deal lawmakers struck to enact the state budget. The bill’s language directs legislative commissions to examine the 911 system and how it might integrate into the new 988 system, a suicide and crisis hotline launched nationwide in July 2022.\nIt also requires the study to recommend “standards and procedures which should be followed when a behavioral health crisis is routed to 988 as an alternative to law enforcement,” and requires the recommendations to consider potential cultural and linguistic barriers between responders and the person in crisis.\nThe language originated with a resolution that state Rep. Maureen Madden, a Monroe County Democrat representing the Hall family’s home district, introduced this fall. Madden took cues from the Halls and the community that mobilized after Christian’s death, she told Spotlight PA.\n“We really need to get out there that 988 is there,” Madden said in an interview. “And then we need to train people who answer the phone for 911 and have them be able to assess, is this really a 911 call or is this a warm handoff for 988?” Related Content Courts & Law Philadelphia City Council reviews 911 system deficiencies City Council members hosted a hearing to talk about problems in Philly's 911 system including a 50-plus dispatcher deficit and not enough police to handle calls.",
