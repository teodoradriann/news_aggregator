    "title": "Teen dies after falling sick at Nicco Park, cops launch unnatural death case probe",
    "text": "A teenager who went to celebrate a friend’s birthday at Nicco Park fell sick while standing under an artificial waterfall and was later declared dead at a hospital on Wednesday afternoon.\nRahul Das, 18, a resident of Ultadanga, had gone with friends who told park officials that their friend had a “blackout” before he passed away.\nRahul and six friends were at the “Niagara Falls” — an artificial waterfall at the park named after the waterfall on the US-Canada border — when he fell sick.\nThe group was standing on a balcony attached to a steep artificial rock-like structure from which water streams down, giving guests a waterfall-like experience.\nNicco Park officials said they were alerted to the boy's illness shortly after 1pm. Rahul was given first aid before being rushed to Calcutta Heart Clinic and Hospital, officials said.\n“The balcony is 15–16 feet above the ground. A flight of stairs leads to this balcony, which even elderly people can easily mount. The water falls over the shoulders of visitors, giving them a soothing experience,” said Rajesh Raisinghi, MD and CEO, Nicco Park.\n“Like other visitors, a group of young boys and girls came to enjoy themselves. A lifeguard spotted that some of them were helping another boy come down from the floor where people stand and enjoy the waterfall. The boy was unconscious. We gave him first aid immediately. The nurse who gave the first aid said his pulse was weak and that we should take him to hospital,\" Raisinghi added.\nRahul was taken out of the water park in a wheelchair with his friends around him. He was taken to a nearby hospital in a Nicco Park ambulance, where he was declared dead.\n“By the time he was brought here, he was no more. There was no sign of life. The ECG line was straight. As per protocol, we tried to revive him, but he was no more,” said Nupur Banerjee, chief medical officer of the hospital.\nThere were no injury marks on Rahul except on one leg, she added.\nPolice sources said the preliminary investigation did not suggest foul play.\n“We contacted the family of the youth and informed them about the incident. The body has been sent for post-mortem. The cause of death would be clear after the post-mortem,” said deputy commissioner (Bidhannagar), Bidhannagar city police, Aneesh Sarkar.\nRahul's friends are being questioned to determine the sequence of events, police sources said.\n“We are trying to find out what the group ate, and if the boy had complained of any illnesses earlier,” said an officer of Bidhannagar city police.\nThe police will ask his family about his medical history.\nCops are analysing CCTV footage from the park. An unnatural death case has been started.\nThe boy's parents came to the hospital in the afternoon but refused to talk.\nThousands — young and old — visit Nicco Park every day to enjoy rides, some of them tagged “unfit” for the elderly or for people with specific medical conditions. The waterfall is “suitable” even for the elderly, a park official said.\n“We keep an eye on guests. We have lifeguards,” he added.",

    "title": "Swoop reports 5% bump in revenue for first half of FY25 - Telco - CRN Australia",
    "text": "Fixed wireless and wholesale network infrastructure provider Swoop has reported financial and operational results for the first half of FY25, achieving $45.8 million in revenue, a 5 percent year-over-year (YoY) increase.\nThe ASX-listed telco also reported a 15% percent organic growth in underlying recurring revenue, as well as a positive NPAT of $2.0 million, on top of completing the $8.8 million divestment of its wholesale voice business in July 2024.\nIn the first half of FY25, Swoop focused on streamlining operations through automation and product specialisation, driving organic growth from previous investments. This contributed to a 12 percent increase in Core Business EBITDA, with Underlying EBITDA reaching $7.3 million.\nSince listing in May 2021 , Swoop has completed nine acquisitions as part of its expansion strategy across Australia, including the acquisition of Moose Mobile in November 2022 for $24 million, which at the time added over 94,000 users to Swoop's portfolio.\nToday, that number has risen to more than 128,000, with total subscriber numbers increasing by 24% since December 2023, all from organic growth. Operational efficiency has also improved, with operating expenses now at 20% of revenue, a 15% reduction over the past three years.\nAs of 31 December 2024, the company has $15.5 million in available funding.\nSwoop recently signed a three-year agreement to provide wholesale internet services to Flip, which is expected to generate over $10 million in annual revenue with further upside as the subscriber base expands\nSwoop has also begun building a 300-kilometer owned fibre network, enhancing coverage for 42,000 businesses and approximately 450,000 residential premises. This initiative is backed by a long-term contract of up to $36 million with a Nasdaq-listed global technology company.\nSwoop CEO Alex West said with the majority of the company’s integrations now complete, a streamlined business model, advanced automation and focus on core products have led to significant growth in the recurring revenue base.\n“We’ve successfully balanced being a competitive reseller while advancing our infrastructure capabilities, enabling us to drive sustainable growth and profitability,” he said.\n“Swoop has achieved record-breaking sales in 1H FY25 across our core products, including fixed wireless broadband, NBN, and mobile. Over the past 12 months, we’ve doubled our NBN market share, reinforcing the demand for our services and our commitment to delivering high-quality connectivity solutions.\n“With a strong foundation in place, we are confident in our ability to drive further success in the second half of FY25 and beyond.”",
