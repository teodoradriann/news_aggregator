STR/CNA/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE TDT Published on: 31 Oct 2024, 16:20\nCopied\nKEELUNG (AFP) — Super typhoon “Kong-rey” made landfall in Taiwan on Thursday as one of the most powerful storms to hit the island in years, whipping up 10-meter waves and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.\nPacking maximum wind speeds of 184 kilometers per hour, “Kong-rey” hit the east coast at Chenggong town in Taitung County at 1:40 p.m., the Central Weather Administration said.\nIt was the same strength as typhoon “Gaemi,” which was the most powerful storm to hit Taiwan in eight years when it made landfall in July, but “Kong-rey’s” radius of 320 kilometers made it the biggest in nearly three decades.\n“Its impact on all of Taiwan will be quite severe,” Chu Mei-lin from the state weather foaecaster, Central Weather Administration, warned.\nWork and schools across Taiwan were suspended on Thursday as people hunkered down ahead of the storm.\nThe streets of Taipei were largely deserted as bursts of heavy rain and fierce wind lashed the capital.\n“This typhoon feels very strong,” 52-year-old office worker Kevin Lin told Agence France-Presse as he enjoyed a day off at home.\n“I’m used to the many typhoons in Taiwan and I don’t feel scared.”\nSuper typhoon ‘Kong-rey’",

    "text": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham\nThe Gunners went down 2-0 at home\nArsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nHis West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nArsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nArsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nFormer West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",

    "text": "A hiker who got lost in the mountains of\nNorthern California for over a week was found alive on Thursday after witnesses heard his cries for help, authorities said.\nLukas McClish, 34, disappeared on June 11 after setting off on a hike in Boulder Creek, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office said. He was found yelling for help 10 days later in a remote canyon in Big Basin State Park.\nMcClish told\nKGO-TV that he had left his home in Boulder Creek with few supplies, believing he was only going for a three-hour hike before getting lost in the Santa Cruz Mountains.\nI left with just a pair of pants, and my pair of hiking shoes, and a hat. I had a flashlight, and a pair of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool. And that was about it,” McClish told KGO-TV.\nMcClish was reported missing five days later after he failed to show up to a family gathering on Father’s Day,\nKSWB-TV reported.\nThe 34-year-old told KSWB that he survived 10 days lost in the wild by drinking water from creeks and waterfalls out of his boot, eating wild berries and sleeping on a bed of wet leaves. All the while, he yelled for help in the hopes of being rescued.\nMcClish’s calls went unanswered until Thursday, when the sheriff’s office said multiple witnesses reported hearing someone yelling for help in\nBig Basin State Park.\nThe\nsheriff’s office launched a drone to establish the exact location of the voice, and spotted McClish in the forest between Empire Grade and Big Basin Highway near Foreman Creek.\nMcClish had no major injuries, according to the sheriff’s office, and he was reunited with his family. Officials shared photos of a ragged McClish hugging family in the woods.\nMcClish said he’s had enough of the outdoors for a while.\n“I did enough hiking for probably the whole rest of the year,” he told KGO-TV.\nMultiple agencies assisted the sheriff’s office in the rescue effort, including CAL Fire CZU, Boulder Creek Volunteer Fire Department, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California State Parks.\nThe post\nHiker lost for 10 days found alive in Northern California mountains appeared first on Fox News.",
