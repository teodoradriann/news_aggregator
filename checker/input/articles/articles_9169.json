    "text": "The Australian War Memorial in Canberra will be commemorating the service and sacrifice of Myola resident Ronald Richard Veivers at the Last Post Ceremony on Tuesday, 23 January 2024. \"Private Veivers was born in Mareeba in 1921 and served in the army in New Guinea during the Second World War,\" said Duncan Beard of the Australian War Memorial said. \"Ronald grew up in a large family in Myola, just outside Cairns. He worked as a stockman before enlisting in the Army in 1942, aged 21.\" \"In January 1944 Private Veivers took part in the battle of Shaggy Ridge, which played an important part in the Japanese defeat on the Huon Peninsula, New Guinea. Ronald was killed during the assault and buried near where he fell, before being reburied at Lae War Cemetery, where his remains lie today.\" The Last Post ceremony is held at 4.30 pm every day except Christmas Day in the Commemorative area of the Australian War Memorial. Each ceremony shares the story behind one of 103,000 names on the [Roll of Honour](https://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/honour-rolls/roll-of-honour). To date, the Memorial has delivered more than 3,300 ceremonies, each featuring an individual story of service from colonial times to recent conflicts. It would take more than 280 years to read the story behind each of the 103,000 names listed on the Roll of Honour. \"The Last Post Ceremony is our commitment to remembering and honouring the legacy of Australian service,\" Memorial Director Matt Anderson said. \"Through our daily Last Post Ceremony, we not only acknowledge where and how these men and women died. We also tell the stories of who they were when they were alive, and of the families who loved and, in so many cases, still mourn for them. \"The Last Post is now associated with remembrance, but originally it was a bugle call to sound the end of the day's activities in the military. It is a fitting way to end each day at the Memorial.\" The Last Post Ceremony honouring the service of Private Ronald Veivers will be live-streamed to the Australian War Memorial's YouTube page; [https://www.youtube.com/c/awmlastpost](https://www.youtube.com/c/awmlastpost). The stories told at the Last Post Ceremony are researched and written by the Memorial's military historians, who begin the process by looking at nominal rolls, attestation papers and enlistment records before building profiles that include personal milestones and military experiences.

    "title": "Don’t trash it, compost it: Mason Facilities adds 23 Bigbelly zero waste stations to campuses",
    "text": "George Mason University Facilities has installed 23 Bigbelly zero waste stations on the Fairfax and Mason Square campuses. These solar-powered stations support Mason’s recycling and composting goals through their user-friendly design, technology upgrades, and capacity-based alerts.\nFive of the new Bigbelly stations on the Fairfax Campus include solar-powered, waste compacting compost bins at outdoor patio sites. Expanded composting access is part of a long-term strategy to improve Mason’s waste diversion rate—the amount of waste composted, recycled, repurposed, or otherwise diverted away from trash.\nThe Bigbelly zero waste stations expand the waste collection benefits achieved through Mason’s\nindustrial composting pilot. Launched in August 2022, the composting pilot included the installation of Mason’s first indoor zero waste station in the Starbucks located in Northern Neck on the Fairfax Campus. The project was funded by University Sustainability's Patriot Green Fund (PGF). A previous PGF grant supported the installation of Bigbelly’s smart-waste management system at the patio outside the Starbucks.\nCapacity alerts from Bigbelly solar zero waste stations increase the efficiency of operations for recycling and housekeeping staff, who are automatically alerted when the stations need to be emptied.\nTo successfully divert food scraps and other compostable items, the university must maintain a clean compost stream. Design changes were installed at waste stations to help reduce waste contamination. The Max-R zero waste station inside the on-campus Starbucks offers helpful design features like waste stream co-location, restrictive lid openings, and color-coded messaging. The station is made of more than 1,600 reclaimed milk jugs, supporting Mason’s post-consumer recycled purchasing\ngoals and guidance.\nThe involvement of Mason Dining was crucial for the success of the industrial composting pilot. Mason Dining staff identified difficult-to-sort items, inventoried common contaminants during weekly audits, and piloted behavioral and educational interventions to support appropriate waste disposal.\nLearn the best ways to sort your compost, recycling, and trash. Check out the\nZero Waste Mason page and see the complete list of zero waste locations.\nRelated Stories\n- November 8, 2023\n- November 7, 2023\n- October 23, 2023\n- September 15, 2023\n- September 13, 2023",

    "text": "New Illinois law should help survivors of gender violence who sue their employers The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, is intended to hold employers accountable for failing to act on complaints of workplace violence.By [Dan Mihalopoulos](/staff/211/dan-mihalopoulos) New Illinois law should help survivors of gender violence who sue their employers The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, is intended to hold employers accountable for failing to act on complaints of workplace violence.By [Dan Mihalopoulos](/staff/211/dan-mihalopoulos) [Sign up for our newsletters](/newsletters)to stay up to date on the stories that matter. A new Illinois law that will go into effect on Jan. 1 should make it easier for survivors of gender violence to sue their employers successfully, say the measure’s sponsors and plaintiffs’ lawyers who pushed for the changes to the statutes in Springfield. The law will allow workers to hold their employer liable for failing “to supervise, train, or monitor the employee who engaged in the gender-related violence” or for not taking “remedial measures” after being informed of alleged misconduct in the workplace. State Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, introduced the legislation in the Illinois House. He said the new law should help survivors who face sexual violence on the job in cases where there were systemic problems that the employers tolerated. “Our message to the survivors is that we’re going to hold accountable not just the perpetrators of the violence, but those people and institutions that should have intervened and didn’t,” Guzzardi told WBEZ recently. “The bosses, the employers who knew or who should have known this kind of violence was happening and turned a blind eye — they too will be held accountable. This legislation will help survivors to seek real remedy for that kind of harm.” [ Two former lifeguards sue the Chicago Park District, saying they suffered sexual abuse when they were minors ](/stories/two-former-lifeguards-sue-the-chicago-park-district-saying-they-suffered-sexual-abuse-when-they-were-minors/31148d25-6a80-405e-b419-2ebddeadf21e) The measure was approved in the spring legislative session by the Illinois House and Senate and signed by Gov. JB Pritzker in July. “When I hear that folks are going to their employer and telling them about harassment that happens in the workplace, and the employers are not taking that seriously, then I really think that there needs to be recourse for these victims,” said the Senate sponsor of the new law, Karina Villa, D-West Chicago. Among those who lobbied lawmakers to pass the measure was attorney Bridget Duignan. Her clients include female ex-lifeguards who have received settlements from the Chicago Park District or [are suing the agency currently](/stories/two-former-lifeguards-sue-the-chicago-park-district-saying-they-suffered-sexual-abuse-when-they-were-minors/31148d25-6a80-405e-b419-2ebddeadf21e), alleging widespread sexual misconduct by supervisors at the [city’s public beaches and pools](/stories/female-ex-lifeguards-describe-deacdes-of-sexual-abuse-at-chicagos-beaches-and-pools/a1844d7a-bedd-43be-89b0-040d8c7f72cc). Although the park district board has agreed to pay settlements totaling nearly $2 million to three women, Duignan said officials had attempted to dodge liability by arguing that the state’s Gender Violence Act, which was approved in 2003, did not apply to employers. Duignan and the legislative sponsors said they hoped the new law would eliminate any doubt that employers can be held liable. It also could make it much easier for survivors to get financial compensation. “If you’re going to recover damages, it’s more likely than not impossible to recover the types of damages that you suffered from an individual, versus an employer who has the means to pay a damage award,” Duignan said. The proposal passed by a 50-0 vote in the state Senate and by a 73-35 margin in the Illinois House in May. According to a transcript of the House debate, the only lawmaker who spoke against the measure was Rep. Dan Ugaste, R-Geneva, who said the changes would “bring down our economy even further.” “All it’s doing is adding more fuel for the various groups to try and make money off of litigation in this state,” Ugaste said. “And it’s going to hamper business and going to have to keep them from hiring more people, investing in their businesses and expanding the Illinois economy.” Ugaste argued that there already are laws that allow employees to “still collect from the employer if there’s something in fact that the employer did to contribute to this.” But plaintiffs’ lawyers said the courts in different cases had shown that greater clarity was needed. “There was a lot of confusion among employees and employers as to what circumstances, if any, could lead to liability for gender violence,” said employment lawyer Gail Schnitzer Eisenberg. She said the new law would succeed in “really specifying what those circumstances for employer liability could be.” The Gender Violence Act gives an accuser seven years to file claims against individuals. But under the new law, the statute of limitations for suing an employer would be four years — though minors who are harmed at work would have four years after they turn 18 to bring a claim.

    "text": "Cold rain showers managed to slip in the door before October wrapped up, with temperatures dropping and a dowsing shower early Thursday morning.\nMeteorologist Dial Hoang of the National Weather Service of Monterey said the colder, wet system moved into the region from the Pacific Northwest and will be followed by another similar system, arriving later today.\n“This low pressure system will move in Friday evening and extend into Saturday in the Watsonville area and give us another shot of rain,” Hoang said. “Today’s high will be around the mid-60s and tonight’s low will be around 43 degrees.”\nStarting Sunday a “warming and drying trend” will seep into our area and continue at least into mid-week with daily highs in the mid-70s.\n“That should continue through Thursday,” Hoang said. “The rains this week — Friday and Saturday — could bring a rainfall total of a half-inch in the lower regions and around three-quarters of an inch in the mountains.”\nMeanwhile, on a longer range, meteorologist Dalton Behringer said that looking forward through January “there are no strong signals for el niño or el niña weather patterns —heavy rain and drier conditions— predicted yet for the Central Coast. “Of course, this depends on many factors. But right now, it appears November into January looks to be edging toward a 33% chance of above average temperatures.” He added that, at this point, precipitation appears to be sitting on the fence, meaning there are no strong indicators that rain will be heavy or light.\n“That outlook, of course, can always change.”",

    "title": "Bombazo: tras el rechazo de Boca, Palermo reveló que podría ser DT de River",
    "text": "En la previa a las elecciones presidenciales que se desarrollaron en Boca cada candidato tenía su posible entrenador en caso de ser elegido. En el caso de Andrés Ibarra el posible DT iba a ser Martín Palermo, quien se mostró afín a esa línea política. Tras conocerse la historia, se supo que la llegada del Titán sería imposible.\nEl ex goleador del Xeneize participó de un partido benéfico en Brasil y tras eso aprovechpó y respondió algunas preguntas de la prensa local en la que se refirió a su futuro.\nLa bomba de Martín Palermo sobre su futuro dlgFZw5H-34516613.mp4 El entrenador decidió no renovar su vínculo con Platense después de haber jugador la final de la Copa de la Liga, que perdió 1-0 frente a Rosario Central, y ahora su próximo destino es incierto. En este contexto, se le consultó sobre qué propuestas podría aceptar.\nUna de las consultas era si aceptaría dirigir a algún equipo que fuese clásico del Xeneize, como River Plate, Independiente o Racing: “Obviamente, mi trabajo es dirigir el equipo que me proponga ser el entrenador que tenga un proyecto. Estoy preparado para dirigir cualquier equipo”.\nEsta frase disparó la discusión en redes sociales, sobre todo por aquellos boquenses que lo idolatran y que esperaban tal vez otra respuesta del Titán. Es importante destacar que en la actualidad el Millonario no tiene en carpeta al ex delantero, y tampoco es opción en Racing e Independiente, que están bajo las direcciones técnicas de Gustavo Costas y Carlos Tevez, respectivamente. Por eso, Palermo aguarda también por alguna oferta del exterior, ya sea Chile, México o incluso Brasil.\nPese a la gran rivalidad que existe entre los dos clubes más poderosos de la Argentina, han habido algunos técnicos que se han puesto el buzo de uno de esos equipos, pese a haber estado identificados con el otro.\nPor ejemplo, Juan José López, quien fuera futbolista de ambos conjuntos y además dirigió a River Plate en 2011, o César Luis Menotti, quien tuvo un paso como jugador de Boca Juniors y fue entrenador de ambos clubes. Héctor Bambino Veira también es un caso a destacar porque supo dirigir a ambos.\nTe puede interesar...\nLa foto: con qué jugador de Boca se puso de novia Morena Beltrán\nJuan Román Riquelme ya es presidente de Boca, pero aún no asumió: la nueva fecha\nLo más leído\nAuditoría de Rolando Figueroa Escándalo con planes sociales: mandan cartas documento a empleados públicos para que \"devuelvan la plata\"\nInvestigación Accidente fatal en la Ruta 151: ¿quién tuvo la culpa?\nDNU La CGT llama a un paro general para el 24 de enero\nbajo neuquino Chocaron en Avenida Mosconi, un auto derrapó y atropelló a una mujer\nRecibí las noticias del día en tu e-mail * Campo requerido Leé más\nLa foto: con qué jugador de Boca se puso de novia Morena Beltrán\nJuan Román Riquelme ya es presidente de Boca, pero aún no asumió: la nueva fecha\nRevelan cuál es el campeón del mundo que nunca jugaría en River: \"Es de Boca\"",

    "title": "Bishops join protest against Charter change",
    "text": "Some Catholic bishops accompanied protesters in Manila against the current attempts to tweak the Constitution. Bishop Jose Colin Bagaforo of Caritas Philippines said they are not letting their guards down against what he called ‘underground works’ for Charter change through the supposed “people’s initiative”. “We are still concerned because we are not sure of the strength of the underground works and they might give value to what is called ‘fake’ people’s initiative,” Bagaforo told reporters. “So we need to be critical, we need to stand up, and we need to raise the voice of the majority,” he said. Bagaforo was joined by Bishop Emeritus Deogracias Iñiguez of Kalookan and former chairman of the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Public Affairs. Several priests and nuns were also seen at the rally held at Plaza Roma, right in front of the Palacio del Gobernador where the main office of the Commission on Elections is located. The demonstration was organized by “Koalisyon Laban sa ChaCha”, composed of various religious groups and civil society organizations. Bagaforo, who is also the bishop of Kidapawan, called on the faithful not to allow lawmakers to revise the Constitution without proper consultation and full transparency. “There are many doubts because there is no transparency. What are their true intentions?” the prelate added. “We pray that our leaders will not be led into the temptation of changing the Constitution for power and riches but instead be steadfast in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities as servant-leaders of the people,” he also said.",
