    "title": "After Delaying Assassin's Creed Shadows Again, Ubisoft Says It's Going to Take Decisive Steps to Reshape Its Company",
    "text": "After delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows once, Ubisoft has decided to delay the game again to March 20th. In a press release , the company says that the extra time will be used to provide more development time for the game. Ubisoft states it intends to incorporate the player feedback it has received over the past three months. Besides improving gameplay quality, the company also aims to polish the Day-1 experience. “We are all behind our teams’ efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin’s Creed opus of the franchise,” Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said.\nThe press release doesn’t just contain an announcement of Assassin’s Creed Shadows ‘ delay. In the document, Ubisoft mentions wanting to reshape its company to ‘enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation.’ It also plans to explore ‘various transformational strategic and capitalistic options’ to benefit stakeholders.\nRelated: YouTuber Discovers More Damning Evidence of Elon Musk Using a Boosted PoE 2 Account: ‘He Just Ran Past a Chaos Orb!’ The press release states that Ubisoft will continue to reduce the company’s expenses by being more selective about its investments. Ubisoft then discusses the cancellation of XDefiant and the closure of three studios located in ‘high-cost geographies,’ which is now confirmed to be caused by high wages.\nAfter the lackluster performance of Star Wars Outlaws , Ubisoft likely wants to ensure that its next big release will succeed. It’s certainly a tall task, considering the numerous controversies and issues that surround the game. To make matters worse, there is even a report of abuse occurring in an Indonesian support studio that worked on Assassin’s Creed Shadows . A spokesperson stated that they were disturbed by the reports, but it’s unclear whether this new controversy has impacted the success of the upcoming game.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows now releases March 20, 2025. pic.twitter.com/wTPzY0oiHy\n— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) January 9, 2025 Fans aren’t surprised to hear about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting another delay. Many agree that Ubisoft is being extra careful to ensure they don’t mess up the launch of their next big title. Some commented that Ubisoft likely doesn’t want to deal with the competition in February. The argument is not unreasonable, considering that Monster Hunter Wilds will be released at the end of that month.",

    "title": "Deep vein thrombosis: Explaining the injury that ended Wemby's season early",
    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The San Antonio Spurs announced season-altering news Thursday when the team revealed that Victor Wembanyama, the team's All-Star center and a Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner, had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his shoulder, ending his sophomore campaign.\nAs unfamiliar as the ailment may sound, however, experts say anyone can be susceptible to developing it--from everyday people to NBA stars.\n“The sooner one is diagnosed and they start treatment, the better the outcomes are always going to be,\" said Dr. John Hogg, a radiologist who founded the Medical Vein Clinic in San Antonio.\nDVT is more commonly referred to as blood clots. According to the Cleveland Clinic, one to three in every 1,000 adults develop the condition in the U.S., making it the third most-common vascular disease behind heart attacks and strokes.\nHere's what else to know about deep vein thrombosis.\nWhat causes it?\nAccording to Hogg, blood clots typically develop out of any combination of three factors: Damage to blood vessels, sometimes from surgery; a lack of movement or a long period of time without movement; genetics or other outside contribution factors like dehydration or hormone replacement.\n“All these factors build up and suddenly that blood’s not moving fast, and slow-moving blood tends to clot,\" Hogg said.\nA cancer diagnosis, obesity, age and estrogen use can exacerbate the risk for DTV, the Centers for Disease Control says. It's a common issue, one that even affects young athletes.\nHeaviness, pain or swelling in the limbs are the tell-tale indicators of DVT or blood clotting, Hogg says.\nThe key sign, however, is when someone is experiencing those issues on just one side.\n“When one’s swollen and different, that’s concerning,\" he added. \"Pain, heaviness, did this fall during a period of inactivity—that sort of thing.”\nThe CDC says DVT usually affects the lower extremities. Having it in the shoulder makes for a \"little more complicated\" situation, Hogg said, in that those areas are closer to the heart and lungs. And the CDC says about 30% of those who develop DVT are at risk of getting it again.\nBut as with other DVT diagnoses, the earlier it's spotted and the earlier treatment begins, the better.\nHow is it treated?\nAs soon as DVT is diagnosed, Hogg says, time is of the essence.\n“We start them on blood thinner right there in the clinic,\" he said. \"It’s very important to start them right away, and they go back to doing their normal lifestyle.\"\nPatients are cautioned against heavy physical activities in the early stages of their treatment, and eventually they might start wearing compression sleeves on their arms or legs to get the blood moving faster, essentially speeding up their recovery.\n\"The more that blood turns over, the more that blood thinner – I call it the Drano – it’s going by there to dissolve that area and open it up faster.”\nWhen it comes to athletes, doctors say DVT can be caused by overhead overuse—think all the dunking, passing and shot-blocking an NBA center is asked to do.\n“It’s not just rest it and it’ll get better, unfortunately,\" said Dr. Michael Peck, with the Vascular Institute of San Antonio. \"It’s probably that he needs the clot to be managed and then whatever caused the clot to be managed.”\nThe blood thinner can be injectable or orally administered to clear the clot, Peck says.\n“But then we need to figure out the structural issue,” which he adds could mean surgery.\nWhat are the long-term effects?\nThe Spurs likely ticked off that vital first step of catching Wembanyama's DVT early.\nThose who let it go untreated for too long, however, face the possibility of \"a lifetime of problems in that limb,\" Hogg says.\n“The sooner one is diagnosed with a blood clot and they start treatment, the better the outcomes are always going to be,\" he said. \"If blood clots go on for days or weeks or even months sometimes, it starts to cause scarring and the vessels kind of get narrowed down.\"",

    "text": "Milan, Pulisic e Leao più forti del caos: ora l’obiettivo è chiaro - - 7 NESSUNA INFLUENZA NEGATIVA - Le ultime 48 ore del mondo Milan sono state molto travagliate per l’indagine della Guardia di Finanza, e l’iscrizione al registro degli indagati dell’ex CEO Ivan Gazidis e di quello attuale Giorgio Furlani, sulla cessione del club da Elliott a RedBird. Proprio Furlani, prima della partita, ha ribadito la posizione della società: \"La proprietà del Milan è di RedBird. Le autorità possono fare indagini, noi abbiamo cooperato con loro dando tutte le informazioni che hanno chiesto e siamo disponibili per ogni cosa. Siamo focalizzati sul fare il nostro lavoro, che è assicurarci che il Milan abbia successo e che i tifosi siano orgogliosi del loro club\". Un'esposizione mediatica pesante che però non influito nella preparazione alla partita di un gruppo che sta diventando sempre più coeso. Ai senatori Theo Hernández, Maignan e Giroud si stanno aggiungendo anche i nuovi protagonisti Pulisic e Loftus-Cheek. Gol e assist a parte, il duo arrivato dal Chelsea sta facendo la differenza anche per gli atteggiamenti e la mentalità mostrare fuori dal campo in un contesto, di pressioni e aspettative, probabilmente molto diverso rispetto a quello che avevano vissuto in quel di Londra. OBIETTIVO DUBLINO - I problemi non svaniscono di certo in una notte e contro un avversario, lo Slavia Praga, nettamente inferiore dal punto di vista tecnico. Ma la crescita di Tomori e Thiaw abbinata alla crescita di Musah e Pulisic lasciano sensazioni positive a Pioli. L’obiettivo è quello di arrivare a giocarsi la finale di Europa League a Dublino, pochi dubbi. Poi toccherà alla proprietà chiarire la propria posizione alle autorità competenti.

    "text": "8:47am Wholesale power prices have doubled in the past three weeks. (Source: 1News)\nSHARE ME\nThe Electricity Authority (EA), under severe criticism over soaring wholesale power prices, says it is not \"not comfortable\" with power companies' explanations.\nAssociate Energy Minister Shane Jones slammed the authority on Thursday as being useless in regulating the generator-retailers (gentailers), which are accused of profiteering.\n\"Under the EA, sadly, that organisation has proven to be a chocolate teapot in regulating the excessive behaviour of the gentailers, who I feel are probably the most powerful economic institutions in New Zealand beyond the supermarkets and the Aussie banks.\"\nEnergy Minister Simeon Brown also called for the Electricity Authority to publicly report power data to ensure there was no price-gouging in the sector.\nWholesale power prices have doubled in the past three weeks, in part because New Zealand's hydro lake levels are at about 47% of what they would normally be at this time of year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEA chief executive Sarah Gillies told Morning Report on Friday there was \"no silver bullet\" for what was ultimately a supply issue.\n\"The EA is not comfortable with the current high wholesale prices and we are already using our powers to drill into why prices are so volatile and so high. We're not comfortable with just accepting industry explanations.\"\nGillies said the EA was using \"our regulatory powers to essentially put more sunlight on the system. So, we're demanding quite specific information about pricing and behaviour in the market.\n\"We already monitor market behaviour, but we are stepping it up in this space. We've also held, or the authority board has held, several emergency meetings this week to make sure that all options are on the table.\n\"We're also doing a number of other things. So, for example, working with the system operator to look at releasing contingent storage, which would enable essentially the lake levels to be lower and more hydro to be available for generation.\"\nShe said a team was analysing trading data to work out what the next steps might be, and will be publishing it weekly.\n\"Partly it's about highlighting what's going on, digging into that, but also using it to inform any other steps that we might need to take.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"There's all sorts of things we can do as a regulator. We've got a range of tools. I can't talk to all of that because it's under active consideration with the board, but essentially we're not comfortable with the state of the situation right now.\n\"I think it's important to recognise that, as I said, we're dealing with a fuel shortage issue and there isn't a silver bullet in the long-term. In the long-term we know that investment is really important for New Zealand. We have to build more generation to be able to support the system in the future, but that's a big part of it. And we have a big focus on the settings that support that investment.\n\"But in the short-term, you know ... looking at what's going on day to day to make sure that everything's above board.\"\nThere was presently no evidence gentailers were deliberately keeping supply low to boost prices, Gillies said.\n\"And frankly, with the spot market prices what they are, we'd expect people to be generating everything that they can.\n\"But that's why we look into exactly what's happening. And as I said, the longer-term picture here is about investment, and that's really another thing for us to be focused on and making sure that investment is coming to market.\n\"It is a transition and transitions are challenging, and our role is to make sure that the industry's pace matches the pace of that transition for the benefit of New Zealand consumers.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the meantime, businesses are threatening to close if costs are not brought down to more reasonable levels.\nHouseholds have been somewhat insulated from the recent hikes, with retailers having purchased electricity on the market when prices were lower. But that situation will not last forever, retailers have warned, with one already deciding to put a halt on taking on new customers.\nBrown said on Friday people needed assurances that the country's power generator-retailers were not engaging in price gouging.\nMore on this topic\nShane Jones accuses big power companies of profiteering Wholesale power prices have doubled in the past three weeks, in part because of New Zealand's hydro lakes storage which is about 57% of what it would normally be at this time of year.\nThursday 6:36pm\n2:23\nBrown would not be drawn on whether or not there was profiteering in the sector, but told Morning Report New Zealanders deserved an assurance that energy prices were not being kept high simply to ensure high returns.\nrnz.co.nz",

    "text": "Kentucky county bans medical cannabis use by its employees\nHARRODSBURG, Ky. (WKYT) - Another local government has decided to ban the use of medical cannabis by its employees.\nThe Mercer County Fiscal Court voted unanimously to ban the use during their special meeting Thursday morning.\nMedical Cannabis will take effect on January 1, and while there are still some hoops to jump through for the very limited use, county and city governments do have the ability to ban the use for their employees.\nMORE\n[Ky. woman shares medical cannabis’s impact on cancer journey](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/18/ky-woman-shares-medical-cannabiss-impact-cancer-journey/)[Kentucky prepares for medical cannabis program rollout](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/18/kentucky-prepares-medical-cannabis-program-rollout/)[Lottery held for Lexington area medical cannabis dispensary licenses](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/16/watch-live-lottery-lexington-area-medical-cannabis-dispensary-licenses/)[Kentucky launches website to help patients find providers for medical cannabis](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/02/kentucky-launches-website-help-patients-find-providers-medical-cannabis/)\nAccording to the resolution adopted by all the Mercer County magistrates Thursday morning, the court cites their drug-free workplace act of 1988, which prohibits the use of any drugs in the workplace by their county employees. They also cited the part of the law that states that employers are not required to permit or accommodate use.\n“We know that the General Assembly approved and enacted Senate Bill 47. We know that allows medical cannabis in Kentucky. But if you flip to the back page under this resolution, pursuant to KRS 218B.40, the Mercer County Fiscal Court exercises its right under this statute to not permit or accommodate the use of cannabis,” Judge-Executive Sarah Steele told the court during the meeting.\nAccording to the resolution, even if a county worker has a prescription and is a cardholder, they would not be allowed to use medical cannabis while employed by the county government.\nThe Richmond City Commission was set to vote on a similar resolution but decided to hold off. The mayor says they want to hear from people at their January meeting regarding the differences between recreational and medical cannabis.\nMatthew Bratcher is with Kentucky Norml, which is working to reform marijuana laws. He says few cities or counties have adopted similar resolutions but is encouraged that Richmond is taking another look at theirs.\n“It’s absolutely good to hear. It means they want to learn more. They want to get the facts straight. Absolutely what these jurisdictions need to do,” said Bratcher.\nBratcher says some large corporations are no longer drug testing for marijuana.\n“It lowers their job pool. It just makes it harder for them to hire. They know this isn’t a bad thing they have already made the move,” he said.\nBratcher says cities or counties have the right to pass resolutions. He says it’s not proven medical cannabis can impair someone on the job.\nCopyright 2024 WKYT. All rights reserved.",
