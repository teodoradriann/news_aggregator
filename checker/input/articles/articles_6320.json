    "text": "01 Aug 2024 | 09:32 PM UTC US: Flight disruptions likely in New York metropolitan area through at least late Aug. 1 due to adverse weather Severe weather causes flight disruptions at airports in New York metropolitan area, US, Aug. 1; lingering delays and cancellations likely. Flight delays and cancellations will likely affect airports in the New York metropolitan area through at least late Aug. 1 due to severe thunderstorms impacting the region. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued ground stops and ground delay programs at LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark Liberty International (EWR) airports that are slated to remain in effect until 17:45 and 00:59 respectively. The FAA may modify or rescind the abovementioned air traffic control programs on short notice. As of around 17:30 Aug. 1, flights to EWR were experiencing delays averaging 173 minutes; flights departing EWR were delayed by an average of around 30 minutes. Flights to LGA were delayed by an average of 68 minutes. Teterboro Airport (TEB) is also experiencing delays to flights departing the airport by an average of 90 minutes. The FAA may issue additional weather-related ground delay programs and/or ground stops for airports in the New York metropolitan area over the coming hours. Residual disruptions are possible even after weather conditions improve as airlines work to clear passenger backlogs. Confirm flight reservations if scheduled to travel via LGA, EWR, TEB or another airport in the New York metropolitan area; do not check out of accommodations until onward travel is confirmed. Consider making alternative arrangements for time-sensitive travel if necessary.",

If you hate pootie diaries, leave now. No harm, no foul. Please do share pics of your fur kids! If you have health/behavior issues with your pets, feel free to bring it to the community. Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs. Birds... are birds! Peeps are people. Whatever happens in the outer blog STAYS in the outer blog. If you’re having “issues” with another Kossack, keep it “out there.” This is a place to relax and play; please treat it accordingly. There are some pics we never post: snakes, creepy crawlies, any and all photos that depict or encourage human cruelty toward animals. These are considered “out of bounds” and will not be tolerated. If we alert you to it, please remember that we do have phobic peeps who react strongly to them. If you keep posting banned pics...well then...the Tigress will have to take matters in hand. Or, paw.

    "text": "En forêt with Vincent Munier at the Musée des Confluences in Lyon invites us to rediscover the forests and the life they shelter. By blending into the forest environment, like the photographer on the lookout, visitors can appreciate this little-known wealth and marvel at the beauty of nature very close to us. The exhibition is also an invitation to explore the forests in a respectful manner, adapting to the wild world.\nVincent Munier writes:\n“The forest is my refuge. It is among the trees, silent and immobile giants which form the link between the ground and the heavens, that I truly feel alive.\nWe have moved too far from this environment and we must not see it only as a recreational area or a source of goods to be taken and exploited. Nor as an impenetrable place of anguish and fear.\nIt is a complex high place, an inexhaustible source of wonder – if we do not overexploit it. We enter on tiptoe to respect the plant and animal species. This exhibition is an invitation to sit at the foot of a tree and exercise your senses to nourish yourself with this accessible beauty… as soon as you manage to step aside.” -Vincent Munier\nForest areas are the setting for abundant life. Photographer and filmmaker, Vincent Munier has been traveling through French forests, particularly those of the Vosges, since his childhood. With the Musée des Confluences, it offers a visual and audio journey into a seemingly familiar but often unknown nature. The images, still and animated, reveal the wildlife that inhabits the forests by inviting everyone to learn to observe, as if on the lookout, to better marvel at this grandiose but threatened universe.\nThroughout an immersive journey, around twenty photographs, seeming to emerge from between the trees, initially offer a moment of contemplation.\nFrom dusk to dawn, deer, lynx, capercaillies, owls and black woodpeckers can be seen in the darkness or behind the mist. Subtle, the images express all the magic that happens when, after a long wait, the observer’s patience is rewarded.\nAn original 20-minute film, projected on the big screen, free of commentary, then immerses the public in the forest following Vincent Munier, on a furtive encounter with the animals: a visual and sound journey conducive to calm, as well as timelessness. To conclude this journey, Vincent Munier shares his work, between an artist’s vision and a militant act, before erasing himself: camera trap captures remind us of the fragility of our forests and the need to protect them.\nVincent Munier : En Forêt\nFebruary 16 – April 27, 2024\nMusée des Confluences\n86 Quai Perrache\n69002 Lyon, France\nwww.museedesconfluences.fr",
