    "text": "原标题：\n主题墙绘出圈、博物馆人流火爆、“非遗热”升温\n“哪吒”上墙，文旅上分\n近来，石家庄骑行圈流行一种新的打卡方式。\n“在石家庄工业遗址公园、仓丰路与翟营大街交口西北角，还有富强大街和塔南路交口，有三处哪吒墙绘成了新晋网红打卡点，骑友们一圈骑下来10公里左右，大家快去沿着这条路线‘会哪吒’吧。”2月24日，石家庄市民宋天祎在骑行群里分享了自己挖掘的“哪吒墙绘骑行路线”。\n她晒出爱车与墙绘的合影，只见画面中哪吒与敖丙红蓝交织的色彩，碰撞出了强烈的视觉冲击力，非常有美感，收获了群里一众点赞，纷纷相约组团找“哪吒”去。\n《哪吒之魔童闹海》（又称《哪吒2》）的火热催生了哪吒墙绘的出现，花样打卡哪吒墙绘在全国成为一种有趣现象，河北也不例外。最近在石家庄、保定、邢台等多地的城市、乡村都出现了各种形式的哪吒墙绘，甚至有地方还打造了“动漫+公交”哪吒主题出行场景，这些艺术形式将哪吒电影里表达的勇敢、活力与无畏精神注入城市脉动，展示新城乡形象的同时，让不少打卡地火爆出圈。\n保定蠡县曲堤镇耿庄村本是一个寂寂无名的小村庄，最近就因为村里80后小伙徐冬冬爆改哪吒墙绘“火”了一把，很多游客慕名而来，只为亲眼目睹这乡村里的“哪吒传奇”。村委会看到这一现象，果断决定将广场周边的墙都画满哪吒墙绘，还邀请了具有当地特色的西庞大鼓队来表演，让这里的哪吒有了独特的田园味道。\n城市更新，美丽乡村建设，都要向美而行，各种哪吒墙绘的出现融入正是其中一个时尚、新颖的范例。乘着《哪吒2》火爆的东风，河北各领域以“哪吒”元素为创作的突破点、宣传的带动点，促进文化旅游事业发展，带动传统文化出彩又出圈，不失为一种良性尝试。\n像河北博物院就以与《哪吒2》中七色宝莲十分相似的错金铜博山炉为宣传点，带动更多群众走进博物馆，了解中国文化。\n“这就是和《哪吒2》里面七色宝莲十分相似的错金铜博山炉。正是有了这件宝器，哪吒和敖丙才能重塑肉身。”2月20日下午，河北博物院志愿者讲解员徐晓鸣正忙着为游客讲解河北博物院的这件国宝，他说从春节期间就有络绎不绝的游客前来欣赏这件文物，这个现象让他们又惊又喜。\n“今年春节期间，河北博物院游客逾17万人次，其中，错金铜博山炉受《哪吒2》影响，可谓新‘流量担当’。”徐晓鸣笑着说。\n而这也启发徐晓鸣他们有了新的和游客们互动的内容和更通俗易懂的讲解方式。“憨态可掬的结界兽和炼仙丹天元鼎，我们能明显看到这上边有我国古老的青铜元素，玉虚宫能看到古建的元素，这件博山炉背后又有什么知识？”面对游客的提问，徐晓鸣耐心地向游客解答：错金铜博山炉是汉代文物中的艺术珍品，整件器物由炉座、炉盘、炉盖铸成，博山炉上山峦间神兽出没，虎豹奔走，小猴嬉戏玩耍，呈现出一幅秀丽的自然风光和生动的狩猎场面……\n不只是错金铜博山炉，《哪吒2》里蒙古族呼麦、侗族大歌、唢呐等非遗元素的加入，也为引发观众对非遗文化的兴趣埋下了伏笔。河北很多非遗手艺人也借此机会，结合河北的非遗特色进行了多样创作。\n“哪吒热度持续攀升，大家对哪吒剪纸的热爱超乎想象，我们也‘蹭’了一下，来宣传我们的非遗文化。”行唐剪纸市级非遗代表性传承人赵成龙说，《哪吒2》一上映，他就结合传统剪纸技艺，创作出哪吒主题系列作品，深受大家喜爱。赵成龙表示，非遗与影视、短视频跨界融合，可以让其以更加开放、时尚的姿态，被更多受众认可、熟知和喜爱。今后他要多用剪纸的方式来展现中国经典名著中人物形象，也要多走到孩子们中间，借助创新表达，让大家喜欢上剪纸。\n铅笔芯微雕“哪吒”、井陉泥塑“哪吒”……在河北，正在兴起一场万物皆可“吒”的文旅嘉年华。在这场嘉年华里，我们看到了现代文艺与传统文化的深度融合，这种融合不仅带来了一定经济效益，更重要的是实现了文化的传承与创新。未来，随着更多优质文化IP的涌现，中国文旅产业必将迎来更加辉煌的发展。这场始于哪吒的文化创新，正在书写中国文旅产业的新篇章。（记者 史晓多 赵瑞雪）\n关注精彩内容",

    "text": "Carol McGiffin had showed off her ageless figure as she poses in a skimpy white bikini. After a tumultuous exit from popular [ITV](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/itv) daytime show [ Loose Women,](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/loose-women) the 63-year-old broadcaster has been living her best life near her French villa. The TV star has been sharing precious moments with friends and commemorating her 15th wedding anniversary with her 41-year-old \"toy boy\" husband, Mark Cassidy. Carol bared her sun-kissed figure in a skimpy white bikini and flaunted her toned legs in a chic shirt dress while chronicling her summer adventures on Instagram. In a lengthy caption, she cheekily quipped: \"Next for #MyYearInReview June/July and August. I’ve lumped them all together because they are collectively 'Summer.' And anyway, [Christmas](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/christmas) came so I felt like a couple of days off.\" READ MORE: [Loose Women's Linda Robson 'told off' by family for dishing dirt on private life](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/itv-loose-womens-linda-robson-31660439) READ MORE: [This Morning's Kate Lawler strips to undies as she shows off jaw-dropping figure](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/itv-morning-star-kate-lawler-31728347) The star also opened up on what she’s been up to since her show exit. \"Mostly these months are spent at home, in the garden, more often than not drinking rosé wine. We hardly ever go away because it’s just too nice here. Luckily lots of our friends want to come for a holiday so we do get to see them.\" Carol dished about their adventures, from trips to La Colombe d’Or to an exquisite day out at The Belles Rives in Antibes. Even Scottish friends from their Asian days made an appearance in July, and her boss from Best magazine paid a weekend visit while Mark escaped to London to avoid their relentless gossip sessions. In a candid interview with Women's Own magazine, Carol recently opened up on her [Loose Women](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/loose-women) exit, calling the show \"very woke\". The star boldly proclaimed: \"My pronouns are P and Off.\" She made it clear that her departure wasn't solely due to the \"wokeness\" but also some other undisclosed factors, leaving fans speculating. Carol, who once appeared on Loose Women from its inception in 2000, made her last on-air appearance on March 2. However, her fiery TNT Radio interview with James Freeman for The Freeman Report sealed her fate, as she hinted at censorship and a stifling environment compared to the \"good old days\" of TV and radio. [Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/uk-news/join-daily-star-soaps-whatsapp-31401287) In her words, \"I always look back at when I started working in television and radio as the good old days because they were much less policed, I suppose. Much less restricted and it was a freer place to be. When I look back at the old Loose Women I used to do from 2000 all the way until I left in 2013, they're completely different. There is so much offence. People take so much offence at so much and they never used to.\" For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters [here](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/)",

    "text": "Madison Streets Division will not be plowing in response to snowstorm MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Madison Streets Division will not be plowing all Madison streets in response to Friday’s snowstorm. According to the city, a rapid response to the salt routes kept the main thoroughfares open. Crews began plowing [Thursday night](https://www.wmtv15news.com/2024/03/22/madison-streets-division-plows-continue-monitoring-salt-routes/) and continued through the day Friday while the storm was taking place. Melting is expected to continue throughout the day as the most intense part of the snowstorm has passed. The warmer weather and rising pavement temperatures will help improve conditions, including residential areas that were not plowed or salted. The city says drivers can expect the salt routes to be in good driving condition and note that untreated residential areas may still be slippery. Cold temperatures are expected Friday night and might cause patchy slick spots. The weekend could potentially bring another snow event overnight Saturday and last into Sunday. Streets Division crews will be monitoring the weather to see if plows will be needed again.
