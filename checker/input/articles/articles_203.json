    "text": "Mother who is accused of killing her baby makes court appearance\nBy Matt Wreden\nClick here for updates on this story\nBUTTE COUNTY, California (\nKHSL) — A Chico woman appeared in Butte County Superior Court on June 6 regarding the fentanyl overdose death of her baby boy.\nChristy Ann Scarbrough, 40, was charged by the Butte County District Attorney’s Office special victims’ unit for felony child abuse with a special allegation that the abuse resulted in the infant’s death.\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Scarbrough found the boy face down in his crib on the evening of July 6, 2023, the boy’s first birthday. The child was blue and unresponsive. She took him to Enloe Hospital, where he was ultimately pronounced dead, Ramsey said.\nAn investigation by Chico police revealed there was a straw in the baby’s crib that tested positive for fentanyl. An extensive investigation was followed by the police and district attorney’s office, including an autopsy that showed an extraordinarily high amount of fentanyl in the infant’s gastric acid, indicating the baby ingested the fentanyl.\nRamsey said Scarbrough is an admitted fentanyl user. The use of a straw is a common method of adult ingestion of fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n“We have overdoses and here’s a child that obviously got into its mother’s stash of fentanyl and expired because of that,” Ramsey said.\nScarbrough was previously convicted of child abuse in 2013 and sentenced to prison when her then seven-week-old daughter tested positive for methamphetamine. Ramsey said it was alleged that Scarbrough was taking methamphetamine and other drugs while breastfeeding the child.\n“Most significant prior conviction to what she was sentenced to state prison was eerily similar in the sense that time her seven-week-old baby was presented to the hospital very sick from methamphetamine overdose,” Ramsey said.\nAt the arraignment on June 6, Butte County Superior Court Judge Kristen Lucena held Scarbrough without bail. Scarbrough is due to return to court on June 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to enter a plea. She faces up to 10 years in state prison.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "title": "Alaska sets new temperature records amid severe heat wave: 'That just cannot happen here'",
    "text": "Fears of record temperatures in Fairbanks, Alaska, were realized in late July, with thermometers hitting 90 degrees Fahrenheit .\nWhat's happening? According to Scientific American , Alaska is experiencing an unusually warm period of weather because of a \"strong bubble of warm air\" and high pressure, as meteorologist Greg Michels detailed.\nThe hottest-ever July 22 was recorded, landing at 90 degrees Fahrenheit to beat the previous high of 89, as The Washington Post observed.\nMichels noted that with fewer clouds in the sky, thanks to the high-pressure system, the sun's rays are uninhibited on the way down to Earth, making the air heat up quickly.\nWith the summer solstice on June 20 leaving a full two hours less daylight time for heat to accumulate by late July, the record high temperature is additionally concerning. While temperature highs are seen elsewhere in the United States during the summer months, climate scientist Brian Brettschneider told Scientific American \"that just cannot happen here ... because you need that sun angle, the hours of daylight.\"\nWhy are record-high temperatures in Alaska concerning? Thermometers are hitting new highs across the globe , so it's not entirely surprising that Alaska is witnessing them, too. However, residents of the state are not equipped to deal with excessive heat, and public health warnings have been issued.\nWatch now: Local hero single-handedly repopulates endangered butterfly species Homes are built to withstand the extreme colds that are typical in the area, so when the temperature creeps higher, trapping heat inside can become uncomfortable and potentially deadly.\nAir conditioning units are flying off the shelves, as Uma Bhatt, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Scientific American. While this is an effective method of cooling, these units require a lot of energy to run, putting a strain on the electricity grid in a time of high demand. This could result in power outages, causing additional problems for residents.\nAir or heat pumps are an alternative method to cool (or heat) a property that requires significantly less energy, and they are much cheaper to run. With high temperatures perhaps a more regular occurrence, residents might want to look into the technology .\nWhat should you do in excessive heat? Staying in air-conditioned areas and away from the outdoor heat is important to help regulate body temperature and avoid the risk of heat-related illnesses. However, air conditioning isn't as ubiquitous in Alaska as it is in other areas of the United States.\nCommunity cooling areas, such as in public libraries or schools, are increasingly popular as temperatures creep upward, so finding these spots is an ideal way to beat the sun's blast.\nOtherwise, avoiding strenuous activity, wearing lightweight clothing, and drinking lots of water is advised by UNICEF .\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",
