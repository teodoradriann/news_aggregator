En un evento inicial realizado en la entrada de la Casa del Estado, junto a otros líderes estatales y actores históricos, la gobernadora Maura Healey mencionó que Massachusetts 250 atraerá a visitantes de todo el país y del mundo, lo que generará un impacto “muy significativo” en el comercio local. “Al igual que fuimos líderes en la revolución estadounidense , este estado, Massachusetts, será pionero en la celebración de nuestra gran nación”, afirmó la mandataria.\n“Durante los próximos dos años, vamos a resaltar y promover nuestro legado revolucionario en cada comunidad de nuestro estado”, agregó.\nA lo largo de los últimos 250 años, Massachusetts ha sido escenario de eventos asombrosos. “Desde el primer recorrido en bicicleta revolucionario hasta enseñar nuevas habilidades a un perro. Desde el primer parque público y la primera universidad, hasta ser pioneros en reconocer el matrimonio igualitario y tener un mariscal de campo de la sexta ronda que ganó seis campeonatos. Pero lo más emocionante no es solo lo que ya hemos logrado, sino lo que estamos haciendo ahora y lo que está por venir . Únete a algo grande, desde las colinas de los Berkshires hasta el valle de Blackstone, la costa norte y sur, el Cabo y las islas. ¡Celebremos como si fuera 1776!”, sostiene el sitio web de Massachusetts 250.\nMassachusetts conmemora los 250 años de la Revolución Americana con diversos eventos durante varios días (Massachusetts 250)",

    "text": "Submitted Joseph Nolan and his wife Blair bought the former Clear River Tavern in Pittsfield. By Katy Savage About two years ago, Joseph Nolan and his wife Blair were sitting on a coach in their home in North Carolina jotting ideas on paper, dreaming of menu items for a restaurant they hoped to own someday. “I would have ideas and she would write them down,” Joseph said. Now, their dream is coming true. The Toasted Pecan, a southern-inspired restaurant, opened Dec. 20 in Pittsfield, in the building of the former Clear River Tavern, which closed in November. “It feels great to have it come alive,” Joseph said. “I’m so humbled by this experience.” Joseph started his first restaurant job at age 16. He worked at a Sicilian restaurant in North Carolina and quickly knew it was what he wanted to do. “I just love cooking,” he said. “ I love when I make a dish and it makes people happy.” Joseph most recently worked at a conference center, managing 80 people. “I dreamed of owning my own place,” he said. “I never thought it would happen. It’s something as a chef you work toward your whole life. When you work for someone else you tend not to have full creative freedom.” Blair, meanwhile, has a background in events, gaining experience first as a hostess at a restaurant while she was in college. The pair moved to Stockbridge two years ago in an attempt to enroll their 8-year-old in a better school system. They quickly fell in love with the community. “We were looking for a smaller public school, smaller classrooms, more community feel, and just kind of how I was raised in the south,” Blair said. Blair, who grew up in Washington, North Carolina said the area was no longer the small town she grew up in and the weather was too hot. “I did a lot of research on where we should move,” she said. They bought a house in Stockbridge from Mark Stugart, who was coincidentally the owner of the Clear River Tavern. They purchased the restaurant after considering their options. “We were like, Oh, my gosh, this is it,” Blair said. “What was really it for us was the view.” They wanted a place to have outdoor weddings. The Toasted Pecan menu features Southern dishes with a New England twist. The menu includes Vermont made products, like jellies, jams and maple syrup. Menu items include apple butter grilled cheese and shrimp and grits — an ingredient they are getting from a supplier in North Carolina since they can’t find grits in Vermont. The restaurant is a family business that they hope their 8-year old and 15-month-old can grow into. They want to build a family-friendly atmosphere for customers. “We have little ones,” Blair said. “That’s what we were looking for. There was a need there for us. And we talked to community members and there was a need for the community as well.” The restaurant is open for dinner starting at 4 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and at 10 a.m. for brunch Saturday and Sunday. The Nolans aren’t turning back. “We love this community and this is my last stop,” Joseph said. “I’m not moving anywhere else.” The post New restaurant, Toasted Pecan, is now open in Pittsfield appeared first on The Mountain Times .",

    "title": "Número de mortes violentas cai 25% na Venezuela em 2023, segundo ONG",
    "text": "O número de mortes violentas na Venezuela caiu cerca de 25% em 2023, estimadas em 6.973, segundo um relatório apresentado nesta quinta-feira (28) pela ONG Observatório Venezuelano da Violência (OVV), referência ante a falta de estatísticas oficiais. \"Esses números representam uma mudança na tendência recente (...) A taxa de 26,8 mortes violentas por 100.000 habitantes é uma importante redução de 8,5 pontos em relação às registradas durante 2021 e 2022, que se situaram em 34,9 e 35,3\", informa o relatório do OVV. No entanto, segundo esse estudo baseado principalmente em casos publicados na imprensa, a Venezuela segue sendo um dos países mais violentos da América Latina. Do total de 6.973 mortes violentas registradas pelo OVV em 2023, 3.112 foram homicídios, 2.332 ocorreram durante operações policiais e 4.003 estão sob investigação. O número total havia se localizado em 9.367 em 2022 e em 9.447 em 2021. Esses números não incluem desaparecimentos, que o OVV estimou em 1.443 em 2023, frente aos 1.370 de 2022 e 1.634 de 2021. Esse país de 30 milhões de habitantes vem registrando uma importante diminuição no número de mortes violentas desde 2016, quando o OVV contabilizou 28.479 mortes desse tipo, em meio a uma enorme emigração, a uma grave crise econômica e à pandemia de covid-19. \"Há uma acentuação dos efeitos do que vem ocorrendo\", disse à AFP Roberto Briceño-León, diretor do OVV, para quem o crescimento de facções do crime organizado \"monopolizou\" a violência ante a fraqueza do Estado e diminuiu, com isso, a letalidade da criminalidade. \"A redução das mortes violentas não significa necessariamente uma diminuição da criminalidade, mas sim uma mudança da criminalidade\", destacou. A média mundial de homicídios é de 5,8 por 100.000 habitantes (15 a cada 100.000 nas Américas), de acordo com o último relatório do Escritório das Nações Unidas contra a Droga e o Crime (UNODC na sigla em inglês). erc/jt/dg/dd/mvv © Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "What a Shame: China's Newest Nuclear Submarine Sank – HotAir",
    "text": "China has been building up its armed forces at a rapid pace over the past few years. We've seen a lot of Chinese Coast Guard vessels harassing the Philippines in the South China Sea. And the PLA Air Force has sent hundreds of fighters and bombers toward Taiwan over the past four years. So given China's habit of bullying its neighbors it's a real shame to learn that the PLA Navy's newest nuclear attack submarine sank in port a few months ago .\nAdvertisement China’s newest nuclear-powered submarine sank pierside in the spring and the Chinese Navy tried to conceal the loss, according to two US defense officials.\nThe attack submarine was the first of its new Zhou-class line of vessels, the official said, under construction at a shipyard near the city of Wuhan. The Zhou-class submarines have a distinctive X-shaped stern, designed to improve maneuverability underwater...\n“It’s not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pierside,” said the senior US defense official.\nSatellite photos from March show the new sub docked and being worked on but images of the same site from June show a large group of floating cranes at the site. Tom Shugart who was first to notice the change told CNN, \"Usually, those submarines, after they get launched, they’re there at the shipyard for several months in outfitting. And it wasn’t there anymore.\"\nThe sub was apparently salvaged but it will likely be many months before it can be readied to set sail again. This is a big setback for this sub but also for the shipyard in Wuhan which built it. No doubt there is going to be a major review of what exactly went wrong here .\nAdvertisement “The sinking of a new nuclear sub that was produced at a new yard will slow China’s plans to grow its nuclear submarine fleet,\" said Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank, and a retired U.S. Navy nuclear submarine officer. “This is significant.\"...\nWhile the submarine was salvaged, it will likely take many months before it can be put to sea.\n“The whole boat would be full of water,\" Shugart said. “You’d have to clean out all the electronics. The electric motors may need to be replaced. It would be a lot of work.\"\nIt's not known if the sub's reactor was operating at the time it sank or whether it posed a radiation threat. There's no evidence China has done any radiation testing in the river nearby. Also unknown is whether there was anyone killed in the accident. If the reactor was running then there would have been someone aboard. Did they get out? We may never know.\nChina is so sensitive to negative reports that having this major embarrassment reported around the globe today must be driving them crazy. Of course, no word of this will appear inside China, not if their army of censors can help it. But lots of Chinese people have VPN accounts to allow them to get past the great firewall. Word will get around eventually.\nAdvertisement It just hasn't been a good week for strongman dictators. This story comes the same week as another military embarrassment in Russia. Their latest nuclear-capable ICBM, dubbed the Satan II, blew up inside its silo, turning the testing ground into a large crater and setting part of a nearby forest on fire. This same missile, which Russia has used to threaten other nations, has failed in four out of five tests over the past two years.",

    "text": "\nJeux paralympiques : une 3e médaille pour Auélie Rivard\nLa Québécoise Aurélie Rivard a décroché l'or aux Jeux paralympiques de Paris.\nL'athlète âgée de 28 ans originaire de St-Jean-sur-Richelieu a gagné le 400 m style libre féminin dans la catégorie S10 en quatre minutes et 29,20 secondes, jeudi.\nL'Américaine Alexandra Truwit (4:31,39) et la Hongroise Bianka Pap (4:35,63) ont complété le podium, dans l'ordre.\nRivard est ainsi devenue la première Canadienne à gagner l'or dans la même épreuve lors de trois éditions consécutives des Jeux paralympiques depuis Stephanie Dixon au 100 m dos dans la catégorie S9 en 2000, 2004 et 2008.\nIl s'agit de la troisième médaille de Rivard aux Jeux de Paris, qui a d'ailleurs établi le record paralympique au 400 m style libre aux Jeux de Tokyo en 2021. Elle a aussi gagné l'argent au 100 m style libre et le bronze au 50 m style libre dans la capitale française.\nQuelques minutes avant l'exploit de Rivard, Tess Routliffe a aussi atteint le podium pour le Canada en paranatation.\nRoutliffe a obtenu la médaille de bronze au 100 m brasse féminin dans la catégorie SB7, doublant ainsi sa récolte parisienne. La paranageuse de Caledon, en Ontario, avait mérité l'argent au 200 m quatre nages individuel féminin dans la catégorie SM7.\nRoutliffe, qui est âgée de 25 ans, a pu célébrer sa plus récente conquête d'une médaille avec sa soeur, Erin, qui est arrivée à temps à Paris après avoir pris part aux Internationaux de tennis des États-Unis.\n« Je l'ai vue dans les gradins et je l'ai saluée. Toute ma famille est ici. C'est tellement merveilleux de la voir ici. Je suis contente qu'elle soit là », a dit Tess Routliffe, qui a aussi souligné que son autre soeur, Tara, a aussi assisté à chacune de ses courses à Paris.\n« Elle (Tara) a toujours été là, donc je dois lui lever mon chapeau. Tout le monde parle d'Erin, mais elle a toujours été là, à mes côtés », a-t-elle ajouté en riant.\nErin Routliffe et sa partenaire de jeu Gabriela Dabrowski, d'Ottawa, étaient les championnes en titre du double féminin aux Internationaux des États-Unis. Elles ont cependant plié l'échine en devant la Russe Veronika Kudermetova et la Taïwanaise Hao-ching Chan en quarts de finale.",
