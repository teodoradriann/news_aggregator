    "text": "Farah Khan has landed in legal trouble as a complaint has been filed against choreographer-filmmaker for allegedly calling Holi ‘a festival for the chhapris (a casteist slur)’.\nAs per ABP News, the FIR was filed on Friday at Khar Police Station. In one of the recent episodes of Celebrity MasterChef, Farah, who was the host, said “Saare chhapri logon ka favourite festival Holi hota hai (Holi is the favourite festival of all chhapri boys aka rowdy young men)\"\nVikash Fhatak, better known as Hindustani Bhau has filed a complaint against Farah Khan for hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus with her insensitive comment.\n\"Sare cchapri ladke ka pasandeeda festival Holi hi hota hai\"\n— ex. capt (@thephukdi)\nDisrespecting Hindu festivals has been normalised by celebs like[@TheFarahKhan]. Instead of Samay, people like her should be put on trial but since she's a member of bollywood there won't be any consequences[pic.twitter.com/mvLYoqTNa7][February 18, 2025]\nAs per ABP News, Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh said, “My client states that this comment made by Farah Khan has insulted the religious sentiments of Hindus. The use of the term ‘Chhapris’ to describe a sacred festival is highly inappropriate and has the potential to cause communal tension.\"\nIt further read, “The incident involves Ms\nFarah Khan, a prominent Bollywood filmmaker and choreographer, who recently made a highly derogatory and offensive remark against the Hindu festival of Holi.”\n“Through this complaint, I seek justice under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and request your esteemed office to initiate legal action against Khan for her irresponsible and inflammatory statements,” it added.\nFarah was also slammed on social media for this statement, a user had written, “I never wanted to drag my favorite actor Shah Rukh Khan and bollywood into this shitty drama, but Bollywood keeps mocking our tradition. If Holi is for chhapris, then why did Farah Khan show SRK celebrating it in Om Shanti Om? She also choreographed “Soni Soni” in Mohabbatein where SRK, Aish, and Big B celebrated Holi. If she believed this then why did she portay Holi in such iconic films? Why this hypocrisy now? Bollywood had no problem showcasing Holi before so what changed Farah?”",

    "title": "Volt Typhoon: Chinese State-Sponsored APT Targets U.S. Critical Infrastructure",
    "text": "The Tenable Security Response Team has uncovered critical details about Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group linked to the People\\u2019s Republic of China. The group has been actively targeting U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including communications, energy, transportation, and water systems, with a focus on maintaining long-term access for potential future operations.\n\\nVolt Typhoon specializes in stealth and persistence, employing living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics to blend in with legitimate system activity. As Tenable highlights : \\u201c Volt Typhoon uses native Windows tools like cmd.exe, netsh and PowerShell to execute commands and conduct lateral movement across compromised networks. By avoiding the use of external tools, the group minimizes their digital footprint, making detection through traditional signature-based antivirus systems more challenging. \\u201d\n\\nInstead of deploying malware, the group exploits legitimate tools to conduct reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and lateral movement. Their targets are carefully selected, and their operations are tailored to specific environments, especially Operational Technology (OT) systems.\n\\nVolt Typhoon gains entry by targeting vulnerabilities in publicly exposed systems, particularly firewalls, VPN appliances, and web servers. The group exploits unpatched systems and default or weak credentials, emphasizing the need for robust patch management. \\u201c Compromised small-office and home-office (SOHO) routers are often used as intermediary devices, making their traffic appear benign and bypassing geolocation-based firewall rules ,\\u201d Tenable explains.\n\\nKey vulnerabilities exploited by Volt Typhoon include:\n\\n \\n \\n \\n CVE \\n Description \\n CVSSv3 Score \\n VPR \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CVE-2021-27860 \\n FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, MPVPN Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type \\n 8.8 \\n 7.4 \\n \\n \\n CVE-2021-40539 \\n Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus Authentication Bypass Vulnerability \\n 9.8 \\n 9 \\n \\n \\n CVE-2022-42475 \\n Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Heap-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability \\n 9.8 \\n 8.9 \\n \\n \\n CVE-2023-27997 \\n Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Heap-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability \\n 9.8 \\n 9 \\n \\n \\n CVE-2024-39717 \\n Versa Director File Upload Vulnerability \\n 7.2 \\n 8.4 \\n \\n \\n \\nVolt Typhoon\\u2019s operational strategy revolves around avoiding detection by using native tools and legitimate processes. This includes:\n\\n \\n Credential Dumping : Using tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials from memory. \\n Persistence Mechanisms : Leveraging Windows Task Scheduler \\u201cto establish scheduled tasks for regular access, ensuring long-term surveillance capabilities.\\u201d \\n \\nThe group also maintains a low profile by cleaning up logs or rotating them to erase evidence of their presence, further complicating detection efforts.\n\\nVolt Typhoon\\u2019s operations underscore the persistent and evolving threats posed by state-sponsored APT groups. Their use of stealthy techniques and focus on critical infrastructure highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures.\n\\n Related Posts: \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n",

    "text": "A party insider claims things were no longer rosy between EFF leader Julius Malema and ex-Secretary-General Floyd Shivambu The breakdown in relations follows Malema uncovering Shivambu&#039;s alleged secret plan to contest him at an elective congress Shivambu announced he would not renew his party membership during an EFF media briefing in Braamfotein, Johannesburg Shivambu subsequently announced joining the ranks of former President Jacob Zuma&#039;s uMkhonto Wesizwe (MK) Party An EFF insider claims that a fallout with Julius Malema motivated Floyd Shivambu&#039;s decision to leave the party. Image: Per-Anders Pettersson Source: Getty Images JOHANNESBURG — Plenty has been made of former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary-General Floyd Shivambu&#039;s resignation. Shivambu dropped a bombshell on Thursday, 15 August, when he announced that he would not renew his party membership. Shivambu &#039;falls out&#039; with Malema The party called a media briefing in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, where he read his resignation letter sent to Malema on Wednesday evening. He capped off his announcement by noting he had joined the uMkhonto Wesizwe (MK) Party, a move the party later confirmed in a statement on social media. According to City Press, Shivambu&#039;s decision to step down follows a fallout with EFF commander-in-chief Julius Malema. In an exclusive interview with the publication, a senior party member said Shivambu had been approached by wealthy individuals who have business interests with the alleged promise to fund a lucrative campaign. The reported deal planned to see Shivambu contest Malema at the party&#039;s elective congress in December, with the former allegedly agreeing to the offer. The news apparently reached the party leader&#039;s ear, leading to a cataclysmic fallout. The source said: &quot;After [Malema] found out about [Shivambu&#039;s] plan, he became extremely brutal, and things fell apart between them.&quot; The drama comes against the backdrop of the VBS Mutual Bank scandal, in which Malema and Shivambu have been implicated. According to reports, Shivambu faces accusations of corruption and large-scale looting after ex-VBS chair Tshifhiwa Matodzi suggested prima facie evidence implicating the pair in a scheme to defraud VBS Bank and its clients. MK Party leader Jacob Zuma axes Arthur Zwane In a related story, Briefly News reported that MK Party leader Jacob Zuma gave senior party member Arthur Zwane his marching orders earlier in August. It is the latest shake-up within the party after Zwane&#039;s reinstatement as Secretary-General less than 30 days ago, ZiMoja reported.",

    "title": "#29 Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\n[#1](c1#c-1) son unos sinvergüenzas. Ellos y los que los apoyan. Mucho marketing, pero ahí seguimos apoyando el belicismo OTAN.\nNi las autonómicas ni las europeas contaron con mi voto.\nSi se piensan que se van a mantener con el \"que vienen los fachas\" y seguir apoyando los genocidios de ucrania y palestina van de puto culo.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Es el asunto del tonto, el dedo y la luna. Pero ya sabemos que eso en la izquierda no ocurre. Somos moralmente superiores.\n[#6](c6#c-6) los menores (y mayores) van a seguir viniendo a España le guste a quien le guste. Salvo que pongas a la armada a disparar a los cayucos como proponen estos neandertales.\nPuedes hacer dos cosas:\n1) ayudar a África para que no vengan\n2) aprovechar que vienen y darles una educación y una salida laboral\nA mí me vale cualquiera de las dos. Lo que me parece inaceptable y estúpido es usar la inmigración como un arma electoral.\n[#6](c6#c-6) El problema es el mismo de siempre. Si omites las guerras que provocamos, la inmigración estaría en mismas cifras que en 2018.\nEl problema, de ser ese y no la natalidad, pero no voy a entrar en eso. Ese supuesto problema no se ataja con antorchas en casas de acogida de niños, ni despotricando, ni siquiera ahogando los con balas de goma cuando cruzan la frontera nadando.\nSe arregla con política, relaciones con marruecos y negociación. Es la única forma. No con pirados con antorchas.\nUna vez se cruza la frontera, si no sabes a donde deportarlos, debes cumplir con los derechos humanos y respetar la dignidad de las personas.\nPq no te olvides que aunque musulmanes y negros, son seres humanos cuyo delito principal es querer buscarse la vida.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Un poco historia te hará más ilustrado. Las migraciones son milenarias, y lo seguirán siendo y eso no lo va a parar ningún gobierno te guste o no, porque quién no tiene nada, le da igual perder lo poco que tiene. Y otra cosa. Europa necesita 50 mill. de migrantes si quiere seguir siendo algo en el mundo,y África tiene casi la mitad de su población con menos de 40 años. Les necesitamos nos guste o no.\nTeniendo en cuenta el contexto, que vox es un partido de gente que ha demostrado tener poca capacidad de gestionar, que es un partido para hacer ruido en la oposición más que para gobernar (igual que podemos en este punto), y que esta crisis de los menores no es ni de lejos representativo del problema inmigratorio.\nPero hay que reconocer que esto es un gesto de honestidad que no recordamos en la política española. Renunciar a poltronas porque se han incumplido puntos que eran importantes para ellos desde el punto de vista de programa. Sobre cualquier otro partido (desde el PP a indepes o el psoe) hay cientos de ejemplos de lo contrario, de aferrarse al sillón y capear las preguntas con una desvergüenza acojonante.\n[#10](c10#c-10)\nLa intolerancia no es algo positivo.\nCuando tu negocias un gobierno y más si eres una minoría estás obligado a aceptar cosas que no vienen en tu programa. Se llama negociar.\nTodo por repartirse 300-400 niños entre 44 millones de españoles, niños que ya están en España (sí, Canarias, señor Abascal, es España y hay que ser solidaria con ella, que también hay españoles allí) y cosa que lleva haciéndose cada año. Ultra\"católicos\" negando el auxilio a niños. VAYA VAYA.\nEs que no dan para más. Ni honor ni pollas, es que son tontos. El \"honor\" es para las batallas, no para la política.\nMe arremango el fajín y apurandome el Cinzano promulgo:\n-Hay un movimiento divertido en la derecha, al crecer Vox, el PP se vio obligado a endurecer sus posturas mas escoradas para intentar recuperar los votos del ala mas reaccionaria que se iban desangrando pa Vox, eso es lo que vimos estos años, un \"a ver quien dice la idiotez mas gorda\". Esta semana asistimos a una nueva dinámica encabezada por el follaardillas, Vox ha visto como le crece un enano por la derecha, no puede permitirlo, o sea q se enfurruñan y se cierran en banda haciendo bandera de... pos algo tan propagandistico y de impacto entre el electorado mas ultra como los MENAS... (Aunque sea algo tan anecdótico como 21 personas, muchos niños, pa acoger en una comunidad como Castilla.... q lo pones en perspectiva y dices q cojones 21 personas no tienes donde meterlas en la españa vacia???? Esto no es \"problema\" esto es publicidad pa sus cafeteros) Con lo que puede ojo puede, que el PP vuelva a intentar pegar un giro hacia el centro (con el debilitamiento del ala dura del partido, Ayuso juapa, te miro a ti q ultimamente estas muy callada) y dejar que Vox y Alvise se maten a garrotazos a ver quien es mas y muy Ejpañó\nGolpe en la barra erupto, niño ponte una tapita aqui anda, que hay que darle culto al cuerpo\nlas que más te afectan.\nEntre muchas otras, presupuestos y reforma laboral a pesar de los sobornos a sallas y adanero y el golpe de estado del por entonces TC pepesuno.\nPara no aprobar leyes... Recuerdas cuánto estuvo Rajoy sin presupuestos? Gracias a eso el hundimiento de España se relajo esos últimos años de gobierno de la trotona, que no pudo robar todo lo que quiso como había hecho con la sareb.\nEra para\n#_13 que tiene estrabismo intelectual y los dos ojos le miran para el mismo lado.",

    "title": "Survey: 75% of Disabled Students Face Bullying, Exclusion | Mirage News",
    "text": "Exclusion and bullying of students with disability is on the rise in Australia, with three in four impacted in 2024, according to a new survey.\nChildren and Young People with Disability Australia (CYDA) can reveal today that 75% of disabled students were bullied last year, while 72% were excluded from school activities or events.\nThis marks a dramatic increase from 2022 when a similar CYDA survey found 70% of disabled students were bullied and 65% experienced exclusion.\nThe damning findings have fuelled widespread calls from the disability sector for all political candidates to commit to urgent action on inclusive education this Federal election.\n\"These statistics are shocking but unfortunately not surprising,\" said CYDA CEO Skye Kakoschke-Moore.\n\"Students with disability, and their families, have been telling governments for years that our schools are simply not set up to truly include them.\n\"Sadly, it seems that not only has nothing changed in the 18 months since the Disability Royal Commission – we have somehow gone backwards. This election is the time to end this trend.\"\nReports of bullying in 2024 included verbal abuse, physical violence, sexual and online harassment, and social exclusion, with students describing being spat on, threatened, groped, or mocked for their disability.\nLily Gaulton, a student with cerebral palsy and autism from Perth, faced some of this firsthand. The 12-year-old said fights and problems occurred daily but were brushed aside as minor misunderstandings by staff.\n\"There was a boy in my class who told someone not to waste their energy running from me when we played. That really hurt,\" she recalled.\n\"[The bullying] went on for a long time and it was really hard.\"\nLily's mother Jenni Crowther said she was often forced to explain her daughter's disability to the school, a process she called \"exhausting\".\n\"The biggest challenge has been getting staff, parents and students to understand that neurodivergent kids can interpret the same situation very differently, and that matters,\" she said.\n\"There are passionate teachers and staff who go above and beyond, but the system isn't set up to give them the time, tools, or resources they need.\"\nCYDA's survey heard from 118 Australian students like Lily. It found that more than two in three (71%) of those who left the education system early cited inaccessibility, discrimination, and bullying as the main reasons.\nWith more than 500,000 children and young people with disability aged 25 and under in Australia, the impact on current and former students is staggering.\nMost are enrolled in mainstream schools, making it critical these settings provide genuine inclusion and support.\nYouth disability advocate Ashleigh Keating pointed to improved teacher training, better resourcing, and a coordinated national strategy as essential for achieving this.\n\"If I were to sum up [my school experience] in two words, they would be difficult and frustrating,\" the 25-year-old Canberran said.\n\"I faced a lot of preconceived notions because I'm autistic, whether that be down to a lack of understanding from staff or a system that is not built for me… I was always told I couldn't or shouldn't do things because of my disability.\n\"These failures have had long-lasting repercussions on me as an adult and have made it harder to engage in things like higher education.\"\nIn 2023, the Disability Royal Commission's final report called for the implementation of a National Roadmap for Inclusive Education and the phasing out of segregated education.\nIt recognised that an inclusive system benefits everyone, improving learning, social, behavioural, and physical development outcomes for disabled and non-disabled students alike.\nWhile the Federal government, and all states and territories, agreed to the idea of a National Roadmap 'in principle', to date no concrete steps have been taken towards making it a reality.\nThis Federal election CYDA is calling on all candidates to finally deliver inclusive education by committing to:\n- Action a National Roadmap to Inclusive Education\n- Set up a national independent oversight body to make sure providers meet their legal obligations\n- Create an Inclusion Fund for Early Childhood Education and Care\n- Provide federal funding to schools to guarantee safe and quality education for students with disability\n- Strengthen pathways into higher education for students with disability\nRead CYDA's full election platform, including its specific demands, here.\nThe following individuals are",

    "text": "‘KYC alone is not enough’: Proof, Reality Defender on threat of AI-driven fraud\nThe growing prevalence of generative AI has unlocked positive potential across a range of industries, but it has also amplified challenges, particularly around identity fraud and trust in digital transactions. In a webinar this week, industry leaders from Proof and Reality Defender discussed the shift in how AI-driven fraud is being carried out and the measures necessary to address emerging threats.\nKelly Pidhirsky, VP solutions consulting at [Proof](https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/proof), highlighted the company’s journey from its roots as Notarize to becoming a platform centered on securing high-value digital interactions.\n“We started out as the first company to bring legal notarizations online, and since then we’ve really revolutionized the traditional paper-bound processes, and it’s all about setting a new standard for digital interactions,” Pidhirsky says. “Fast forward to today, and it’s so much more than just online notarizations, not that that’s not incredibly important, it’s still the foundation, but we’re all about now becoming this comprehensive, identity-centric platform.”\n[Proof’s identity authorization network](https://www.prove.com/solutions/prove-identity-network) cryptographically binds verified real-world identities to digital documents, aiming to reduce fraud and ensure compliance. With a client base spanning over 7,000 organizations, including financial institutions, healthcare providers, and real estate firms, Proof has redefined trust in virtual environments.\nThe general consensus from the panelists is that generative AI has evolved significantly, with real-time [video deepfakes](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/video-deepfake-fraud-threat-is-real-helplessness-is-not-id-rd-webinar) emerging as the next frontier. While previous limitations, such as errors in extreme facial angles or actions like touching one’s hair, were evident even six months ago, recent breakthroughs have overcome these barriers. This progress allows fraudsters to convincingly impersonate individuals in real time, a feat that requires sophisticated training and computational resources.\n“The rise of generative AI exacerbates identity trust issues,” Pidhirsky adds, pointing to the ease with which bad actors can exploit advanced tools to impersonate individuals and undermine KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols. “KYC alone is not enough,” she warns, [citing an $81 billion annual loss](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FTA_Identity_Final508.pdf) attributed to identity-related fraud.\nBattling deepfake threats\nMason Allen, head of sales at [Reality Defender](https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/reality-defender) addresses the increasing sophistication of deepfake technology, which has evolved from crude digital imitations to hyper-realistic manipulations capable of undermining enterprise and government systems. Reality Defender, a New York-based cybersecurity company, employs multi-model approaches to detect signals of synthetic media in real time, offering defenses against fraudulent activity. [Reaching $33 million](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/reality-defender-expands-series-a-to-33m-integrated-by-accenture) in an expansion of its series A funding round last month, the company’s AI detection models, trained on extensive datasets, enable real-time identification of deepfake forgeries during critical moments of user verification.\n“Deepfakes are the next iteration of a cat-and-mouse game akin to antivirus software,” Allen remarks, explaining how Reality Defender continuously adapts to emerging deepfake techniques. He emphasizes the alarming scale of the problem, referencing [Deloitte’s projection](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/deloitte-predicts-losses-of-up-to-40b-from-generative-ai-powered-fraud) that generative AI fraud could become a $40 billion annual challenge by 2027.\nIn financial contexts, real-time video calls are often used for KYC processes and high-value transactions. However, fraudsters have begun exploiting these mechanisms. For example, a deepfake scam earlier this year involved impersonating a chief financial officer and two deputies on a live Zoom call, resulting in the theft of $25 million. Such incidents highlight the vulnerabilities of existing identity verification systems.\nThe risks extend beyond financial crimes. Deepfake technology has been used to impersonate CEOs in scams and misinformation campaigns, taking advantage of executives’ publicly available voice and image data. Even high-profile figures, such as [U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, have fallen victim to deepfakes](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/ben-cardin-targeted-apparent-deep-fake-call-dmytro-kuleba-rcna172776), with a recent incident involving a fabricated interaction with a purported Ukrainian official.\nGenerative AI platforms like Runway and ChatGPT have progressed rapidly, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and synthetic media. Allen illustrates this with examples of advancements in video generation technology, noting how deepfakes have evolved to the point of being indistinguishable from authentic content. While these tools enhance creativity and efficiency, they also empower bad actors to scale social engineering attacks and financial fraud with minimal technical expertise.\nCall to action\nThe speakers shared a call to action: a reevaluation of digital identity verification systems to address vulnerabilities exposed by generative AI. Pidhirsky emphasizes the importance of verifying the “living, present person” behind documents, while Allen stressed the need for enterprises to adopt proactive measures in identifying and mitigating deepfake risks.\n“Generative AI isn’t just a future problem, it’s a present reality,” Pidhirsky warns. The webinar advocates for enhanced collaboration between technology providers and stakeholders to secure digital interactions against increasingly sophisticated threats.\n[Proof, Entrust and TransUnion](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/entrust-proof-transunion-offer-platforms-insights-to-combat-financial-fraud) are also introducing tools to address fraud risks.

    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors. The Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action. \"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors. \"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\" The Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets. The Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series. Toronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth. Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers. Avello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list. \"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\" The Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots. No Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks. Toronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops. Last month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year. \"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\" Surprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC. Buffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot. \"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada. \"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\" Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth. Ontario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion. Toronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. \"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\" The Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth). Rick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference. Peter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates. \"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play. \"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.
