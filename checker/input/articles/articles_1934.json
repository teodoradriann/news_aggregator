    "text": "<p>Bengaluru: In an unusual cybercrime, fraudsters impersonated the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of an IT consulting firm headquartered in the US and drew a part of his salary in India, totalling Rs 16.29 lakh, for seven months.</p>.<p>A case has been registered based on the complaint by Harish U C, the HR manager of Kenai Technologies at its office in Bengaluru's Vidyaranyapura.</p>.<p>According to Harish, on January 30, 2024, he received an email on his official email address from r**@kenai-us.com. In the email, the sender identified as the Georgia-based firm's CEO Ram Kasibhatla and sought to change his salary account.</p>.<p>Harish, as per the FIR, responded and asked the sender to email the necessary documents for the change, including the bank account details.</p>.<p>On January 31, the sender responded with a bank account from the Indian Overseas Bank along with the IFSC. The account-changing process was then initiated, said a police official.</p>.<p>From March 31 to October 31, the CEO's salary was credited to the account provided by the scamsters from the company’s official account. </p>.<p>The FIR said a whopping Rs 16,29,632 was deposited to the bank account provided by the fraudsters. \\\"We have learnt that the CEO drew a part of his salary in India,\\\" a senior police officer told <em>DH</em>. \\\"The fraudsters also emailed the office in the US for a change in the bank account there. It was halted there once the fraud was realised.\\\"</p>.<p>In October, Kasibhatla checked his bank account only to realise that the salary had not been credited. He subsequently informed the HR department. The CEO also informed the company that the salary had been pending from March to October.</p>.<p>“Since the CEO, who constantly travels between Bengaluru and the US, was a highly paid individual, he seldom checked his bank statements regarding the salary,” the officer quoted above said. </p>.<p>Harish, according to his complaint, forwarded the email he received from the fraudsters to the CEO saying that he had requested an account change.</p>.<p>When the CEO denied sending any such email, Harish realised the con and filed a complaint with the cybercrime police and an FIR was registered on November 9 under sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).</p>.<p>A police investigator said that the bank account was local and they have begun tracking the money trail.</p>.<p>\\\"It is found that the HR department had lapses as they failed to verify the email,\\\" the investigator told DH.</p>.<p>\\\"In the email, instead of mentioning the IFSC, the suspects wrote 'bank routing number'. There was no name of the account holder. These were some red flags the company should have noticed. Bank routing number is a terminology used in the US and hence we suspect the perpetrators may be based there.\\\" </p>.<p>The investigators are awaiting details of the account from the respective bank. </p>",

    "title": "How To Craft a Successful Professional Development Program for Your Employees - California Business Journal",
    "text": "Building a team that grows and adapts isn’t just a perk — it’s essential for a thriving and modern corporate environment. The trickiest part is developing a professional development program that really gets the job done for your team and aligns with where your company is headed. This article explains how to craft a development program that gets your entire staff on board. It’s all about finding smart ways to make learning a part of the day-to-day functions of your office, making sure your team keeps up with evolving business practices and gets excited about where they’re going next. What Is a Professional Development Plan? A Professional Development Plan (PDP) is your roadmap for team growth. Instead of being a collection of random training sessions, it’s a thought-out plan that matches what your team members want to learn with where your company plans to go. It looks at where your team is now and where they hope to be in the future — skill-wise and career-wise. Sid Shamim, CEO & President of [Headway Capital](https://headwayinvestment.com/) shared how pivotal a PDP can be: “A PDP guides each of your team members through their growth journey, making sure they pick up the skills that matter most to them and the company at large.” With a PDP, you can turn individual aspirations and company goals into a clear path forward, giving your team the tools they need to grow for their own careers and the health of the company. This approach ensures that everyone is moving in the right direction, with all eyes on the prize — a more skilled, motivated, and aligned team. How Can You Build a Winning Professional Development Program? The creation of a successful professional development program requires the careful consideration of several key factors. Each of these elements plays an important role in ensuring the program’s effectiveness and its alignment with both employee aspirations and business objectives. Understand Employee Needs and Goals Getting a clear picture of what your team hopes to achieve is a smart first move. Everyone has a different idea of what success looks like. So, sitting down and figuring out what skills your team members are eager to learn helps tailor the program to their unique needs and makes sure everyone feels heard. “Attending to the goals of team members helps create a program that’s as unique as they are, fueling their drive to learn,” said Brianna Bitton, Co-Founder of [O Positiv](https://opositiv.com/). By zeroing in on individual goals and matching them with your company’s future plans, you’re setting the stage for a program that resonates deeply with your team. This turns the idea of professional development from a “must-do” into a “can’t-wait-to-get-started.” Align with Organizational Goals When your team’s growth lines up with the company’s trajectory, you’ve created a recipe for success. It’s like making sure all the oars of a kayak are pulling in the same direction — suddenly, moving forward feels a lot easier. Erin Banta, Co-Founder and CEO of [Pepper Home](https://pepper-home.com/) shared, “Finding that sweet spot where personal development and company goals meet makes the journey more rewarding for everyone.” This alignment does more than just streamline efforts. It ensures that as your team gets stronger, your company does, too. Plus, it makes everyone feel like they’re part of something bigger, working together towards a shared vision. Offer a Variety of Learning Opportunities Diving into a mix of learning styles and formats can make all the difference in a professional development program. Everyone learns differently. Some might prefer using books or online courses, while others might find workshops or real-world projects more helpful. By offering a range of options, you make sure everyone has an opportunity to grow. “Offering different ways to learn keeps the experience fresh and engaging,” said Brandon Adcock, Co-Founder and CEO of [Instaflex](https://www.instaflex.com/). “Allowing team members to choose what works best for them makes the learning process more effective.” Bringing a variety of learning opportunities to the table means you’re accommodating different learning styles while encouraging your team to take ownership of their development, picking and choosing what interests them most. This approach boosts engagement while ensuring that your training sticks. Encourage Mentorship and Coaching Adding mentorship and coaching to your program brings a personal element to professional growth. It involves pairing people who can share wisdom and insights in ways that traditional training can’t. These one-on-one connections offer direct, personalized feedback and guidance, speeding up the learning curve. [Christopher Gross](https://hbr.org/2023/06/a-better-approach-to-mentorship), founder and CEO of Ascension Worldwide, noted, “Mentors and mentees meet regularly one-on-one to form a two-way partnership where mentors gain a deeper understanding of mentees’ unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. In conjunction with training, this process fosters empathy and cross-cultural communication. It helps both parties overcome fears and biases, ultimately building a more culturally competent work environment for everyone.” Mentorship enriches the professional development journey, making it more than just skill acquisition. It’s a way to weave personal growth with professional skills, fostering an environment where everyone feels supported and understood. It strengthens the team through improved skills and by building a more connected, empathetic work culture. Track Progress and Offer Feedback Tracking progress and giving feedback are core aspects of any PDP. Seeing where you’re headed and how you’re doing helps everyone stay on course and keep improving. Sara Alshamsi, Founder and CEO of [Big Heart Toys](https://bighearttoys.com/) mentioned, “Feedback sessions and regular updates make sure that new knowledge is retained and everyone understands their progress. It makes adjusting and growing smoother.” By measuring how things are going and talking about it, you make learning more personal and effective. It shows what’s working and what needs a tweak, making sure everyone grows in the right direction. Plus, it keeps the team engaged and eager to learn more, boosting both skills and morale. Invest in Technology and Resources Pouring resources into the latest tech and learning tools is a game-changer for professional development. Still, it’s not just about having the shiniest new gadgets — it’s about what your team does with them. The right tools can open up new ways of learning and collaborating that were off the table before. [Mohammed Anwar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/04/08/dont-invest-in-technology-without-investing-in-employees/), CEO of Merit Services, stated, “All the technology in the world will be useless without a team of trustworthy employees who not only can, but want to, make it work. It’s the employees at their desks, on the shop floor or in the field with company technology on a regular basis, and it’s their hands-on use that can bring out its best, or lay its value to waste.” Investing in tech means investing in your team’s potential to innovate and excel. When they have what they need to make the most of their skills, the sky’s the limit. This empowerment encourages them to push boundaries and explore new territories, armed with tools that make anything possible. Integrate Learning into Daily Tasks Making learning a natural part of work can transform how teams grow. When every task offers a chance to learn something new, employees don’t just complete tasks — they evolve with them. It turns the daily grind into a series of growth opportunities, keeping work fresh and engaging. “Integrating learning into daily tasks sharpens skills and shifts mindsets,” shared Dominique Zimmermann, CEO and Head Designer of Bombshell Sportswear, a company known for their line of [scrunch butt leggings](https://www.bombshellsportswear.com/collections/scrunch-booty-leggings). “Tasks become opportunities for constant improvement, not just items to check off a list.” Adopting this approach means growth is a constant process. Employees start seeing challenges as chances to learn, which keeps them motivated and drives continuous improvement across the board. Foster Soft Skills for Success In a world that’s rapidly evolving, focusing on soft skills — like communication, leadership, and teamwork — can make a big difference. These skills enable your team to adapt to changes smoothly and work together more effectively. “Enhancing soft skills can equip your team with the tools to navigate complex workplace dynamics and build stronger relationships,” noted Bridget Reed, VP of Content at The Word Counter, a company known for their [random word generator](https://thewordcounter.com/). “It’s these skills that often make the difference between a good team and a great one.” Cultivating an environment where soft skills are valued and developed can transform the workplace. It leads to better collaboration, more effective problem-solving, and a culture where everyone feels supported and understood. Ultimately, it’s these human skills that can drive a team to achieve extraordinary results. Leverage Real-World Projects Nothing beats the hands-on experience of tackling real-world problems. By incorporating actual projects into your development program, you give your team a chance to apply what they’ve learned in a practical setting. It’s one thing to understand a concept theoretically and another to navigate its challenges in real-time. “Applying new skills to real-world projects reinforces learning and boosts confidence,” said Cody Candee, Founder and CEO of [Bounce](https://usebounce.com/). “Team members see firsthand the impact of their work, bridging the gap between theory and practice.” This approach helps solidify new knowledge and skills, making learning more meaningful and memorable. It also provides invaluable insights into each team member’s abilities and potential, allowing you to tailor future learning opportunities even more effectively. Prioritize Work-Life Balance Getting work-life balance right affects how well your workforce will receive your PDP. When employees see you acknowledge their personal lives outside of work, they’ll be more likely to embrace your PDP with open arms. Unsurprisingly, employees would rather dive into learning opportunities that don’t mess with their personal time. “Flexible learning that fits into different schedules shows a commitment to the team’s well-being and their professional growth,” explained Travis Mydock, DUI and Criminal Defense Attorney at [Mydock Law](https://www.mydocklaw.com/). This way, everyone feels seen for what they do at work and who they are outside of the office. It opens up space for them to grow professionally without sacrificing their personal life, making for a happier, more driven team. Grow Stronger Together Building a professional development program requires more than lining up a bunch of training sessions. It’s about creating an environment where everyone is geared up to learn, share, and support each other. You’re setting up a space where growth is part of the daily routine, and everyone feels they’re part of something bigger. Maggie Brown, Founder and CEO of [Recess Pickleball](https://www.recesspickleball.com/) shared, “Focusing on growing together transcends skill-building. It cultivates a future that shines brightly for everyone, united in a collective drive to advance.” That’s the goal: making sure the journey to getting better is one we’re all on together and making strides as a team.
