    "text": "Martin urges tough sanctions on extremist West Bank settlers if violence goes on Sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers guilty of targeting Palestinians in the West Bank should go further than travel bans if the violence persists, the Tanaiste has said. The US and UK have already announced that they will ban such extremist settlers from entering their countries while EU leaders are set to consider similar proposals. It comes after an upsurge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinians living in the area have accused Jewish settlers of using the Israel/Hamas conflict in Gaza as a pretence to seize more land and engage in violence in the West Bank. At his end of year media briefing, Micheal Martin was asked whether sanctions should go further than visa bans and whether Israel should be forced to pay for the damage committed by settlers. “We are part of the West Bank consortium (group of EU states and the UK) which is endeavouring to put pressure on Israel to pay for damage to any EU funded infrastructure and most recently there was a school that was funded by Irish Aid that was very badly damaged by Israeli forces,” he said. “We believe what’s happening in the West Bank is shocking, it’s in violation of UN resolutions and in violation of international humanitarian law and we’ve made it clear consistently at UN and other levels that this has to stop now. “Yes, I think sanctions should go beyond travel bans if this persists. Israel is saying it’s a small minority but the evidence is that the action of settlers has been backed up by the IDF on the ground with Palestinians being attacked and various communities being displaced. “The issue fundamentally is if we are to have any chance of a contiguous Palestinian state the action of the settlers has to stop, particularly with the far right, very religious fundamentalist settlers who almost believe that the biblical reality is this is all of their land and they can displace anybody in their way, that has to stop and the Israeli government has a responsibility to stop that.”",

    "text": "It was just one year ago when edge rusher Trey Moore made his decision to leave the UTSA Roadrunners and make the short 82 mile trip up to Austin to join the Texas Longhorns football program. Though Moore was by no means a household name, the promising young linebacker did make waves while playing for the Roadrunners, finishing third in the nation with 14 sacks during the 2023 season while on his way to being named the AAC Defensive Player of the Year.\nNow just one year later, when it looked like a distinct possibility that Moore would bolt for the NFL Draft or the transfer portal — as many of his Longhorns teammates already have — the veteran edge rusher announced he will be returning to to Texas for a second season, according to ESPN college football insider Pete Thamel. Moore was projected by most outlets to be a day three pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nThough he wasn't nearly as productive as he was while playing at UTSA, Moore was an immediate contributor for the Longhorns while competing for snaps with top-tier teammates against a step up in competition in the SEC. He finished his first season at Texas with 35 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries. Two of those 5.5 sacks came in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal against Arizona State.\nMoore will be joined by four incoming freshman — Justus Terry, Lance Jackson, Myron Charles, Josiah Sharma — who are top 250 prospects along the defensive line. The Longhorns in general currently have the top ranked recruiting class in 2025, per 247Sports, edging out SEC rivals Georgia and Alabama, along with Big Ten powerhouses Ohio State and Oregon in the top five. Steve Sarkisian's squad hasn't been faring nearly as well in the transfer portal, but there's plenty of time to make up ground there.",

    "title": "Re: Wifi Drops out",
    "text": "We’re here 24/7. 365 days a year.\nAsk questions. Find your answers. Connect.\n3 hours ago\nSince installation of our Eero 6 we have had intermittent problems with the wifi dropping out (especially in our Lounge and upstairs) was thinking of getting an extender to help with this but before I purchase one I understand that this may not solve the issue [Message for KeithFrench](/t5/Full-Fibre/Message-for-KeithFrench/m-p/3072620#U3072620)\nWe run health checks and it is always Ok and the wifi comes back on but it gets annoying and not sure whats causing the buffering and drop outs!\nAny advice would be much appreciated\nThanks\nDonna\n57 seconds ago\nThanks Keith much appreciated and yes very annoying as Talk Talk installed it (or a subcontractor) so a bit disappointing that they don't bear your recommendations in mind when putting them in. Unfortunately, it cant really be moved easily and certainly not to the lounge without lots and lots of trunking! As mentioned the only thing in the way is concrete walls and double glazed windows but possibly other devices are a problem? I assume I need to download the wifi scanner (Or Netspot free in my case) to a home desktop (Apple Mac) that is connected to the wifi and then follow your guide? In the meantime, I will look at the possibility of moving the eero to a higher location but within the same room to see if this might help\n56 minutes ago\nHi [@Donna2569](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/747828)\nThanks for that. I disagree with whoever installed the eero, that it would be fine near a TV. It needs to be moved, but this is not as daunting as it might sound. There is just an Ethernet cable connecting the eero to the ONT, which I assume is nearby. Is there somewhere else in the lounge that it could be moved to? If there is, then buy a new Cat 6 minimum Ethernet cable (loads on Amazon) and you can also get self-adhesive white plastic trunking to hide it in. The general rule for the new location is do not keep the eero in a cupboard, but out in the open and sited as high & centrally within the property. Keep them away from:-\na) Thick window glass or glazing can block Wi-Fi signals.\nb) Low-emissivity (Low-E) windows have a metallic film that can reflect and block Wi-Fi signals more than clear glass.\nc) Tinted glass often has a metallic film that can interfere with radio signals.\nd) K glass double glazing has a metal vapour coating that can reduce Wi-Fi signal strength by 30-50%.\nDo not worry about interpreting the results, I will do that for you. I will send a PM to you that contains a link for a guide of mine on Wi-Fi interference. It is quite long (about 30 pages), but you will probably only need to look at three or four pages in total. Initially look at the section called \"Are you suffering from interference – prove it first\". This is the first link in the table of contents. This section includes full details of free Wi-Fi analysers that I recommend for Windows, Windows phone, Android and Apple operating systems. However, I have no way of testing the Apple product. Select the analyser of your choice & my guide explains how to use it.\nIf you are using Wi-Fi Scanner, then please attach the zip file to this thread. As soon as I have downloaded it, I will remove the attachment from your post, to preserve your privacy.\nWith all other analysers, please follow my instructions below.\nCollect the screenshots that I require and include them in your reply.\nPlease post the screenshots to me in a PM (to protect your privacy), which I have requested in my guide. No photos please as they can be difficult to read, because the text can get out of focus when zoomed in. Please ensure that the analyser window is maximised (if Windows) before taking the screenshots & upload them via the \"Insert Photos\" button (in a mobile browser it's the picture icon) on the post editor's toolbar with the Size parameter set to Large.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer. If my post has fixed the issue, please set Accept as Solution from the 3 dot menu.TalkTalk support and Community Stars - Who are they?\nan hour ago\nThanks Keith your response is much appreciated and if you could send us the guide that might be useful\nIn the meantime, the eero is located downstairs on top of a TV cabinet (so yes its near a TV) which we did mention to the guy when he installed it but he said it would be fine. It doesnt have to pass through any large metal objects or water just concrete and stud walls. To be honest though prior to the eero we always had problems with Talk Talk broadband with the TV in the lounge buffering. Its not as bad now with eero but still does it and its still annoying. This TV does use the 2.4Ghz band and intermittently buffers when streaming (Netflix, Fire Stick etc) . However, we do also have similar problems in the kitchen and bedrooms upstairs which all use the 5Ghz band. Thought a booster may help but not sure as it can be fine for days and then just drop out and as soon as you go on the app and run a health check it connects again and says wifi is all connected?\nan hour ago\nHi [@Donna2569](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/747828)\nThanks for creating your thread.\nPlease can you roughly describe where the eero is within your property & what is around it, in respect of other electrical equipment? Is it likely that to reach the dead zones, the WiFi signal would have to pass through any large metal objects or tanks of water etc?\n.Slow speed, intermittent dropouts, breaks in the signal or no signal on some or all devices or no internet access might be caused by Wi-Fi interference from other local networks, which can also lead to a permanent reduction in speed. No ISP can be responsible for your local environment, this is mainly a byproduct of the popularity of Wi-Fi.\nHowever, other factors should be investigated first. When this happens, what is the status displayed in the app for the internet connection? Do you have any wired connections & if so, how do they perform?\nGenerally speaking, the 2.4GHz band suffers a lot more from interference than the much faster 5GHz band, but the 2.4GHz one can sometimes have a better range, but this all depends on your local area.\nIn other words, I try to help you optimise your Wi-Fi connection. The next stage involves sending out a guide to you to help you get me some important diagnostic results so that I can analyse them for you and recommend changes to your router configuration to solve them.\nI only send this out to people who request it.\nWhilst the eero is supposed to manage Wi-Fi interference, if this is very bad, particularly in the 2.4GHz band, then it cannot do anything about it, no router can. The same goes for any router at that point.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer.

    "title": "‘Unhappier than ever’: Worker happiness tanked in Q2",
    "text": "Will workers ever reach pre-pandemic levels of happiness? It’s hard to say, according to researchers. Analyzing data from 57,000 employees, BambooHR has found a steady decline in happiness since 2020. Overall, the score dipped from 44 in May 2020 to 35 in May 2024, signifying a “troubling trend.” “This persistent decline throughout Q2 2024, with scores consistently below 36, is alarming and signals a critical need for organizational introspection and action,” [BambooHR’s Head of HR Anita Grantham](https://www.bamboohr.com/resources/guides/employee-happiness-index-q2-2024) said in a statement. Based on researchers’ cross-section of the data, worker happiness in the second quarter dropped in the following industries: - Travel and hospitality, which experienced a 12% drop between Q1 and Q2 of this year. Still, researchers noted, this was a slight year-over-year improvement. - Tech, which also reached a four-year low. “Persistent layoffs” and inflation were to blame for these workers’ unhappiness, BambooHR said. - Healthcare, where the score dropped 7% in Q2. Workers cited lack of sufficient compensation as the reason for their dissatisfaction. - The restaurant, food and beverage industries, although this score declines every summer, researchers noted. “Heat-related illnesses and fatigue” were named as a major issue this year. What can HR do to make workers happier? “Organizations should prioritize open communication, listen to employee feedback, and proactively work toward creating a positive and supportive work environment to foster a culture of happiness and productivity,” BambooHR researchers said. From Grantham’s perspective, employers should work on engagement. She called out supporting employees through “workplace transitions” specifically. This is in keeping with what labor experts have previously told HR Dive: Engagement plays a critical role in [return-to-office success](https://www.hrdive.com/news/good-return-to-office-policies-engagement/693823/). In particular, they highlighted the importance of employee resource groups and activities that can give workers “something to look forward to.” This also mirrors a finding about workplace morale in the report. [Workers at smaller companies tended to be happier](https://www.bamboohr.com/resources/guides/employee-happiness-index-q2-2024#the-smaller-the-company-the-happier-the-employees) than those at big companies. For example, people working at companies with 24 employees at most had happiness scores of 50, while those with 76 or more employees had scores in the 30s. “Even if you have a large business, if you treat it like a small business — breaking into groups and categories and having those people get together — I think that's really amazing for camaraderie,” one employer said. Beyond camaraderie and providing opportunities for peer-to-peer recognition, researchers recommended imbuing workers with a sense of purpose. Aiding employees in understanding “how their work contributes to the organization’s goals and the broader community” can help, researchers said. Additionally, they recommended showing empathy for workers’ well-being, “particularly in high-stress industries.” This looks like providing employees with sufficient work-life balance and advocating for time off. Don’t search for solutions to employee dissatisfaction just for the sake of improving metrics, said Grantham. The goal should be to build “a workplace that genuinely prioritizes the well-being and satisfaction of every employee, thereby cultivating a culture of sustained happiness and productivity.” The news wasn’t bad across the board, BambooHR found. The construction industry maintained high happiness scores, despite some slight dips this spring, and the education sector’s June score was the highest it had been in four years.",
