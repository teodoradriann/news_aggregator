    "title": "Slashing the stigma: Victoria-based director to release menopause documentary",
    "text": "Victoria-based director Kate Green has recently completed a groundbreaking project on bringing awareness to the natural (and often overlooked) cycle, menopause.\nThe documentary is an empowering and hopeful look at menopause for all that are going through it, will go through it, or wish to support someone during.\nDirected and produced by Green, Menopause: Coming in Hot, aims at breaking down barriers and stigma surrounding menopause and how it impacts women worldwide.\nConsidering over one billion women across the globe are postmenopausal and new women are facing this new stage each day, Green wanted to redefine it as an empowering transition while acknowledging its challenges.\nIn an interview with Green, she said it was inspired by her own experience navigating peri-menopausal symptoms, and she hopes to shift how other people approach it as well.\n“It’s been a really eye-opening process,” Green laughed.\n“Knowing and learning about my own personal symptoms and sharing them with the world has been a very vulnerable experience, and getting insight from the many experts we interviewed has been so valuable.”\nGreen added that one in two women feel completely unprepared for this stage in their lives, especially as they reach the peak in their careers and are looking to level up, only to get hit with a new phase without much straightforward help and solutions.\nIt underlines the gap that needs to be filled in this area of healthcare, especially when you look at the hit on the workforce\n“There’s $237 million dollars lost in productivity every year in Canada, so when a third of your workforce is going through this, you would think that [businesses] would try to fill this gap,” she said.\n“There’s a lot of work that needs to be done.”\nGreen also said in addition to businesses needing to come up with better supports for women, the lack of education can, unfortunately, be traced back to the lack of information provided to doctors as they go through training.\n“Doctors are given an hour or maybe two hours of menopause training, or not at all. UBC just announced that they’ll be adding menopause information to their curriculum, so that’s a step forward.”\nSo, while it may not be the doctors fault if they’re unsure what to do or say if a woman comes to them for menopause symptoms, Green said that it’s shocking that this level of uncertainty hasn’t been corrected by adding it to more curricula.\nThis information came from some of the medical experts Green interviewed, including Dr. Lori Brotto, a Canadian psychologist who is a renowned figure in the field of women’s sexual health; and Dr. Whitney Wood, who discussed the history of women’s health.\nSome of the groups that stood out, and are a recommended resource for community and shared experience include the women at the Menopause Foundation of Canada and Shirley Weir’s support website called “Menopause Chicks.”\nGreen said that as humans continue to live longer lifespans, it’s important to know what’s needed to protect joint and muscle health as we age, and part of that is understanding menopause and how it changes the body.\n“There’s so much more that we have to do preventatively now [that] we’re living four or five more decades after we turn 50.”\nGreen laughed and said that it’s amazing how much the conversation has changed even within the last few years, adding that maybe it’s because of the Gen X’ers like herself that no longer want to just sweep these issues under the rug.\n“It wasn’t even called ‘menopause,’ it was just called ‘the change.’”\n“I do think the education in this has to start with women at a younger age, it goes back to the idea of preventative healthcare and medicine.”\nShe highlighted this adds a sense of urgency to the topic, which was also part of the motivation to get this documentary out there.\nWhen asked what her hope is for the documentary, she said the main one is to make an impact and remind women that life and beauty isn’t over the second menopause hits—that there are many incredible years left and you’re not alone in this experience.\n“Women that I talk to that have gone through it and are on the other side, say that it’s the best years of their life. They give—excuse my language—zero f***s…they are free and have all this knowledge and maturity and experience, and are still young.”\nShe believes there will be pieces that anyone can resonate with, as everyone probably has an individual either going through menopause or will eventually.\nIn terms of any advice Green has for anyone going through menopause, she says to talk to your doctor, find a community and be open about it.\n“The more we talk about it, the better off the next generation will be.”\nGreenlit by TELUS originals, this feature documentary was directed and produced by Green, and co-produced by Amber Orchard. Also on the production team included Olivia Fellows and Jessica Young of Young Fellows Pictures.\nThe film’s cast and crew was approximately 90% women, giving the show an authenticity in its approach and execution.\n“Our camera crew was all female…and our post-production was all women…in the film industry women have been fighting for change, and the change has started to happen,” Green said.\n“This only happened because women kept talking, kept fighting for equality, and that’s the hope I have for menopause. By doing that, you fight the stigma, and then it just becomes a normal part of our society and is not taboo.”\nThe film’s release will depend on festival appearances, so stay tuned on Green’s website for dates!",

    "text": "Gloria Radulescu torna a Il Paradiso delle Signore . Ci torna per riprendersi Alessandro Tersigni. Un ritorno che farà piacere a tutti gli amanti della soap opera del pomeriggio di Raiuno. Un ritorno, quello di Marta Guarnieri che svonvlgerà la vita di tutta la sua famiglia e quella dell’ex marito Vittorio Conti. L'attrice che interpreta Marta e che il 15 dicembre è tornata sul set del Grande Magazzino più amato dopo due anni di assenza. «È stata una grande emozione tornare nella soap e ritrovare i miei compagni di viaggio», ha confidato Gloria a Nuovo Tv.\nPer chi se lo fosse dimenticato Marta era fuggita negli Stati Uniti dopo aver scoperto di non poter avere figli e quindi di non poter costruire una famiglia con il suo amato marito Vittorio Conti (Alessandro Tersigni). Poi però in America succede qualcosa che la spinge. a tornare in Italia.\nUn ritorno che farà rumore: Marta ha riabbracciato il padre Umberto Guarnieri (Roberto Farnesi), e ha ritrovato il suo ex marito Vittorio, che però ora è innamorato di un’altra donna, Matilde Frigerio di Sant’Erasmo (Chiara Baschetti). La Radulescu rivela che però «a un certo punto Marta si renderà conto che in fondo al suo cuore nutre ancora un forte sentimento per Vittorio. Chissà se anche lui avvertirà le stesse emozioni! È un bel mistero, tutto da scoprire a partire dal 1° gennaio, quando torniamo in onda».\nIntanto in questi due anni Gloria ha viaggiato molto ma ha soprattutto «scritto il mio primo lungometraggio, che ho già inviato al ministero della Cultura, per cui incrocio le dita. Mi sono dedicata allo yoga e al benessere psico-!sico e ho aperto una pagina spirituale sui social, che si chiama Vai Oltre».",

    "text": "Circle Shares Slide Despite Strong Earnings as USDC Growth Falls Short\n- Following its latest earnings report, Circle shares dropped more than 6% even as USDC circulation rose 90% to US$61.3 billion (AU$93.9 billion).\n- Analysts highlighted slower USDC growth, rising distribution costs, and broader macroeconomic pressures as key factors affecting performance.\n- Mizuho lowered its price target to US$84 (AU$128.8), citing concerns over margin compression and elevated stock valuation.\ncCircle Internet Group shares fell by more than 6% following the company’s latest quarterly earnings report, despite posting strong results. The amount of USDC in circulation rose 90% year-over-year to US$61.3 billion (AU$93.9 billion), while total revenue and reserve income climbed 53% to US$658 million (AU$1.01 billion).\nAnalysts at Mizuho Securities suggested that the stock’s decline was partly due to slower-than-expected growth.\nCircle had projected USDC to achieve a 40% compound annual growth rate, but quarterly growth of just 6% fell short of these targets. They also highlighted that distribution costs have risen from 39% of the reserve pool in 2022 to 64% in the second quarter of 2025, which has reduced margins.\nAnalysts additionally noted that broader macroeconomic trends were affecting investor sentiment. A slower rise in US consumer prices – reported at 2.7% year-over-year in July – has raised expectations of potential interest rate cuts, which could negatively affect Circle, given its reliance on higher rates for revenue generation.\nMizuho Cuts Stock Target\nMizuho lowered its price target from US$85 (AU$130.2) to US$84 (AU$128.8), maintaining an Underperform rating, reflecting concerns about margin compression and slower-than-anticipated USDC growth. Circle’s shares are currently trading at around US$100 (AU$153.2), giving the company a market capitalisation of US$41.1 billion (AU$62.9 billion).\nMizuho senior analyst Dan Dolev commented that Circle’s post-IPO valuation appeared high relative to actual USDC adoption. He highlighted that while US policy changes have eased the use of stablecoins, real-world adoption of USDC has not met expectations.\nDespite its strong quarterly performance, Circle’s combination of slower growth, rising costs, and high valuation has created pressure on its shares, leaving analysts cautious about near-term performance.\nRelated: Circle Seeks to Open Bank to Expand into TradFi Custody Services",

Veo bien que tener un título pueda ser algo privado, que no se pueda saber si tienes X o Y titulación si no lo dices tú, pero una vez lo dices, no veo mal que se pueda consultar, sobre todo en casos como este donde la persona es muy conocida.\nEs tan mentiroso que si le das un reloj y le quita las pilas, este no llegaría dar la hora correcta dos veces al día.\nEn realidad aunque tuviera el título (la facultad dice que no), tampoco sería periodista.\n[#17](c17#c-17) A ver, que ya sabíamos que le comías los huevos a pagascal con absoluta efusividad, no hacía falta que te retratases aún más.\nQué grande el excoletas por haber retratado a toda la escoria fascista, aplastapobres y vendepatrias de este país. Todavía se sabe que escuece viendo que tienen a bastardos malpagados defendiendo lo indefendible por doquier. Son tan tiernos.\nPues hay que ser muy lerdo, negado, para no acabar la carrera de periodismo, esas carreras de pintar y colorear; Si me dijeras una carrera de ciencias, quizás.\nMira que no valer ni pa eso.\nAlvise es un tentetieso para salir de Ayuso. Me dan ganas de votar cada noticia de Alvise SPAM a partir de ahora.\nAdemás de mentiroso es que es subnormal: la figura del licenciado hace años que no existe. En todo caso sería graduado. Es más, lo pone en la banda.\nEstá claro que se hizo la foto de graduación con créditos pendientes y ahora va de que ha terminado la carrera.\nBueno, quizás haya acabado las asignaturas que le acababan en Mayo o Junio...\nLa prueba que dice la chavala resentida esta de que está matriculada con ella no me parece que signifique mucho a estas alturas del año.\nQue el colegio le pida cuentas a él por decir que es Periodista sin serlo, si es que es así.\nPero no sé porque tanto revuelo, la verdad, es periodismo, ni que fuese una carrera de ciencias.\n[#4](c4#c-4) bueno, pero eso también aplica a muchos de los que a día de hoy ya tienen el titulo. Incluso a muchos que llevan décadas con el titulo\n[#10](c10#c-10) además, esa afirmación la dijo Pablo Iglesias sí, pero estando soltero, sin hijos, sin mercenarios de la derecha amenazando a su familia.\nComo mínimo, una persona de \"bien\" con un mínimo de razonamiento, se daría cuenta que una afirmación así estando soltero, no se puede mantener cuando estas en pareja, o formando una familia, porque esa decisión ya no es sólo tuya.\nPor lo tanto, solo un necio puede llamar hipócrita a Pablo Iglesias por no seguir viviendo en Vallecas.",
