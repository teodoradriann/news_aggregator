    "text": "Jamshedpur, Jan 16: Playing possession-based football with efficiency in the final third, table toppers Mohun Bagan Super Giant will seek to unlock Jamshedpur FC’s propensity to hit on the counter, in a duel of two thriving teams in the Indian Super League here on Friday.\nMohun Bagan sit comfortably at the top of the points table, garnering 35 points from 15 matches with 11 victories and two draws to their name.\nJamshedpur are fourth, having won 27 points from 14 outings. Interestingly, they can bridge the gap with the Mariners with a prospective victory in this clash, since they have a game in hand as compared to the Jose Molina-coached team. Jamshedpur will look to further their three-game victorious streak, as the Mohun Bagan will pursue securing a league double over the Red Miners for the second straight season.\nThe last time the Red Miners went on a longer winning streak was in 2022, when they recorded seven consecutive victories, including a 1-0 win over Mohun Bagan. However, Jamshedpur have lost each of their last three ISL meetings with the Mariners, failing to score in the last two. Another defeat will equal their joint-longest losing streak against any opponent in ISL history.\nMeanwhile, Mohun Bagan are in a purple patch upfront, scoring in each of their last 12 ISL games. A goal in this match will set a new record for the Mariners’ longest scoring streak in the competition. Having won the reverse fixture 3-0 on November 23, they will look to record consecutive league doubles over Jamshedpur.\nJamshedpur have permitted an average of 26.6 touches per game in their own penalty box this season, the highest of any team, while managing just 3.1 sequences of 10+ open play passes per game, the third lowest in the league.\nThey have developed a distinct style of play, which has seen them score 22 goals, and has covered over these aspects so far, but the Mariners will have their eye out on exploiting these areas.\nDespite these challenges, Stephen Eze and Javi Siverio have excelled in aerial duels, winning 3.8 and 3.6 aerial duels per game, respectively, which is the highest in the league.\nThe Mariners will have their task cut out against Jamshedpur, since the Red Miners prefer stretching the opposition’s defences and delivering lateral balls, while Eze’s presence ensures that they aren’t vulnerable in defence when the opposition undertakes a similar route.

    "text": "Kerala: Bishop Joseph Kariyil of Cochin diocese slams 'Illuminati' song from movie Aavesham; Know why Bishop Joseph Kariyil of the Cochin Diocese criticized Malayalam movies like Aavesham and Manjummel Boys and Kerala's liquor policy for promoting alcoholism, aligning with the Syro-Malabar Church's stance against extended bar hours and reduced dry days. He particularly slammed the song 'Illuminati' from Aavesham movie.\nAishwarya Nair First Published May 25, 2024, 2:21 PM IST Follow Bishop Joseph Kariyil recently criticized Malayalam movies, including \"Aavesham,\" \"Premalu,\" and \"Manjummel Boys,\" for promoting alcoholism. During a program organized by the church for children in Kochi, he specifically targeted the \"Illuminati song\" from \"Aavesham,\" claiming it conflicts with church beliefs. Bishop Kariyil expressed concern that such films are being promoted as positive influences, which he believes is detrimental to societal values.\nHe highlighted that today's children are quick to sing the \"Illuminati song\" from the movie \"Aavesham,\" but many are unaware that the Illuminati is an organization opposing church beliefs. The bishop condemned \"Aavesham\" for its frequent bar scenes, violence, and beatings. He noted that if asked to sing, many children would choose the \"Illuminati\" song, underscoring a lack of understanding about its implications. Additionally, he criticized the movie \"Premalu\" for also depicting violence and alcohol consumption.\nThe Syro-Malabar Church has taken a firm stance against the recent changes in Kerala's liquor policy, viewing them as a betrayal of the people. Bishop Joseph Kariyil supports this position, arguing that films promoting alcoholism exacerbate the issue. The church has criticized the state government for eliminating dry days and extending bar hours. According to Syro Malabar Sabha PRO Antony Vaddakekara, the promotion of alcohol under the pretext of tourism development is deeply concerning.\n'Illuminati' is sung by Dabzee and the music of the song is given by Sushin Shyam. Lyrics of the 'Aavesham' song 'Illuminati' are written by Vinayak Sasikumar.",

    "text": "Dos Pueblos girls basketball was bested by powerhouse Bellevue by a score of 63-52 on Wednesday at the SoCal Holiday Prep Classic. The Chargers jumped out to an early lead thanks to some aggressive offensive play, and both teams went back and forth until the game was knotted up at 27-27 heading into halftime. The third quarter was another tight one, but Bellevue rattled off a solid run in the fourth and Dos Pueblos couldn’t recover, ultimately falling 63-52. “It was a great test and challenge for us,” Chargers coach Manny Murillo said. “Turnovers and indecisiveness played a role in our loss. I could have done better with my adjustments and rotations.” Justine Katz was the lone Charger in double figures with 13 points. Taylor Grant followed with nine points while Lia Papador and Eden Wynne each added seven points. “Lia Papador was a major spark for us and kept us in the game,” Murillo said. “She is getting into her flow approaching the mid-season mark.” Dos Pueblos is now 9-3 on the season and will continue play at the SoCal Holiday Prep Classic on Thursday.",

    "title": "We Tested the World's Brightest Full Frame Zoom: The Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art | Fstoppers",
    "text": "Firsts are always an exciting thing. Now, world’s first? That's another category in and of itself. At Fstoppers, we had the pleasure of testing Sigma's brand new 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art lens for Sony E mount. A behemoth of specs in a tiny package. So, of course, we had to take it somewhere epic—and what better place than the lush, dark, and moody ancient forests of central Pennsylvania?\nRight off the bat, the most impressive aspect of the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art is that it has that constant f/1.8 aperture throughout its entire zoom range. There has never been a full frame zoom lens like this before. The brightness and optical performance are sharp as a tack. It's so sharp that it's even rated as rivaling the sharpness of many prime lenses. This is all due to its construction of 18 elements in 15 groups. The lens boasts three aspherical and five Special Low Dispersion elements. This all helps control glare, ghosting, and visual aberrations. The diaphragm of the lens is an 11-blade design. This not only hones in on both clarity and sharpness but also provides that smooth bokeh we love as photographers when we’re photographing wide open.\nThe next spec that catches my eye as a landscape photographer is that the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art has an 11.9-inch minimum focusing distance. This means that you can do layered compositions with a foreground, middle ground, and background with your foreground right up close leading into the scene. Or you can get in tight on textural details almost like a macro. This came in very handy for me, which I'll explain later.\nSigma 28-45mm F1.8 DG DN Art Splash-resistant Design\nNot Just for Photos I also want to touch on how the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art can be an amazing tool for video production. The zoom function of this lens is all internal. If you do video, you know this means you can put it on a gimbal and not have to worry about rebalancing while zooming. The autofocus is also extremely quiet, and I could not hear any mechanical sounds while shooting video on either the internal microphone of the camera or an external mic with or without a wind muff shield or cover for noise reduction.\nFull Specs Here’s a rundown of all the juicy specs of this lens before we dive into how it performed in the field:\nMaximum Aperture: f/1.8 Minimum Aperture: f/16 Lens Mount: Sony E Lens Format Coverage: Full frame Angle of View: 75.4° to 51.3° Minimum Focus Distance: 11.9 inches / 30.2 cm Macro Reproduction Ratio: 1:4 Optical Design: 18 Elements in 15 Groups Diaphragm Blades: 11, Rounded Focus Type: Autofocus Image Stabilization: No Filter Size: 82 mm (Front) Dimensions (ø x L): 3.5 x 6 inches / 87.8 x 153.4 mm Weight: 2.1 lb / 950 g Two AFL buttons Focus mode switch Super multilayer and nano porous coatings Water- and oil-repellent coating on front element Dust- and splash-resistant design Durable brass bayonet mount\nIn the Field So, of course, on paper, this lens looks amazing, but how did it actually perform in the real world? Well, to test a lens at f/1.8, I had to take it somewhere to push that brightness to the limits. I brought it to the ancient forests of Northwestern and Central Pennsylvania. Under a canopy of thousands of acres of towering hemlocks and white pines, this forest provided the perfect low-light environment to test an aperture of f/1.8.\nI hiked the forest trails in a full rainstorm, the leaves and lush ferns dripping and glistening. I photographed everything from wide forest scenes and waterfalls in long exposure to tight close-ups of mushrooms. The splash-resistant design and water-repellent front element were very helpful as I was completely soaked in the rain. The experience and resulting photos were well worth days of hiking in wet boots.\nSigma 28-45mm F1.8 DG DN Art 1:4 Macro Style\nThe mushrooms in particular were something special—some were as large as a dinner plate, others tiny and fragile-looking. With the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art lens’s close 11.9-inch focusing distance, I was really able to get up tight and show off the colors and textures of the fungi. You could even see the tiny insects crawling around this little fungi world. With a macro reproduction of 1:4, it's a nice lens to explore tiny worlds with.\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, I went wide. When photographing the waterfalls in long exposure, I also upped the difficulty factor by creating my photographs as a panoramic. With large, sharp individual files for my pano, I was able to puzzle them together into one huge picture with all of the little details captured. I can imagine it making a beautiful print. I really love creating panoramic pictures, even when I don’t necessarily need to, just to have that extra resolution and file size in my final image. A lens as sharp and versatile as this is perfect for that kind of thought process because you're capturing that fine detail you really want.\nSigma 28-45mm F1.8 DG DN Art Woodland Scenes\nFinal Thoughts As I look back on my experience reviewing the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art, another aspect I noticed in the field was just how petite this lens is. At 2.1 lb for an f/1.8, it’s really good. This matters to me because, as someone who is traveling or hiking as part of my photography experience, the weight of my gear is important.\nSpeaking of puzzles and things fitting together, as I test more gear, I start to look at how it will fit into your kit. With the zoom range of this lens being 28 to 45mm, it's a really good sweet spot for photographers of all genres that walk around and take pictures where you need a wide to normal zoom range. Then, with that bright constant f/1.8, you can tackle all different types of light—even video, as mentioned. All in all, it's a solid offering by Sigma and a great world’s first. I can’t wait to see what they come up with next!\nIf you would like to add the Sigma 28-45mm f/1.8 DG DN Art for Sony E to your photography kit, you can find it at B&H by clicking here .",

    "text": "Adiós al verano: la Tierra está cambiando y los científicos confirman que se va a notar en España\nCuando pensamos en el verano, solemos imaginar días largos, calor intenso, vacaciones y un ritmo de vida más relajado. Sin embargo, pocas veces nos detenemos a pensar que la duración exacta de las estaciones no es fija. Aunque en el día a día no notamos grandes diferencias, lo cierto es que el tiempo que dura cada estación puede variar ligeramente cada año debido a factores astronómicos. En 2025, por ejemplo, el verano será un poco más corto que el anterior. Sólo serán 15 minutos menos, un margen casi imperceptible para la mayoría, pero que revela cómo los movimientos celestes que rigen el planeta Tierra afectan incluso a lo que creemos más rutinario y predecible.\nDetrás de éste pequeño ajuste en el calendario estacional no hay ninguna anomalía ni tampoco se trata del cambio climático. Se debe, más bien, a la combinación de elementos como la inclinación del eje terrestre, la forma de la órbita de la Tierra y las fuerzas gravitatorias que actúan sobre nuestro planeta. Son estos factores los que determinan no solo la existencia de las estaciones, sino también su duración exacta en cada ciclo anual.\nLa inclinación de la Tierra: clave para entender las estaciones\nLa existencia de las estaciones, algo tan cotidiano para nosotros, se debe a una característica clave de la Tierra: su eje de rotación está inclinado unos 23,5 grados respecto al plano de su órbita, conocido como la eclíptica. Esta inclinación provoca que, a lo largo del año, los hemisferios norte y sur reciban diferentes cantidades de luz solar, lo que da lugar a las variaciones estacionales.\nDurante el verano en el hemisferio norte, el Polo Norte se inclina hacia el Sol, lo que resulta en días más largos, temperaturas más elevadas y mayor intensidad de la luz solar. Lo contrario ocurre en invierno, cuando el Polo Norte se inclina en dirección opuesta, provocando días cortos y fríos. En el hemisferio sur, el patrón es inverso.\nA pesar de que esta inclinación es constante, otros factores entran en juego a la hora de determinar cuánto dura exactamente una estación. Y ahí es donde entra la forma de la órbita terrestre y la velocidad con la que se mueve el planeta a lo largo de ella.\nLa órbita terrestre: una elipse, no un círculo\nMuchas personas imaginan que la Tierra gira alrededor del Sol en una trayectoria circular perfecta. Pero en realidad, la órbita de nuestro planeta es elíptica, una especie de óvalo que hace que en ciertos momentos del año estemos más cerca del Sol, y en otros más alejados. Estos dos puntos clave son conocidos como perihelio (cuando estamos más cerca del Sol) y afelio (cuando estamos más lejos).\nSegún la segunda ley de Kepler, el planeta se desplaza más rápido cuando está en el perihelio y más lentamente cuando se encuentra en el afelio. Esto tiene una consecuencia directa sobre la duración de las estaciones. Al moverse más rápido cuando está más cerca del Sol, la estación correspondiente será más breve. En el caso actual, el verano en el hemisferio norte se produce cuando la Tierra está cerca del afelio, lo que le da a esta estación una duración un poco más larga que otras, aunque esta diferencia varía año tras año.\n15 minutos menos de verano en 2025: ¿por qué ocurre?\nSegún cálculos astronómicos recogidos por la plataforma Time and Date, el verano de 2025 tendrá una duración total de 93 días, 15 horas y 37 minutos. En comparación, el verano de 2024 duró 93 días, 15 horas y 52 minutos. Es decir, una diferencia exacta de 15 minutos menos este año. Aunque este margen pueda parecer anecdótico o irrelevante, representa la influencia constante y sutil de las dinámicas orbitales sobre nuestra vida diaria.\nEstos ajustes no se deben a ningún cambio abrupto, sino a la evolución continua de las condiciones astronómicas que afectan a la posición relativa de la Tierra en su órbita. Entre ellas se encuentran los cambios en el momento exacto del afelio y el perihelio, y también la influencia de otros cuerpos celestes sobre nuestra órbita.\nLas fuerzas invisibles: Júpiter, la Luna y otros actores celestes\nAunque el Sol y la Tierra son los protagonistas principales en este escenario, no están solos. Otros cuerpos del Sistema Solar ejercen también una influencia gravitacional sobre nuestro planeta. Júpiter, por ejemplo, debido a su enorme masa, tiene la capacidad de alterar ligeramente la órbita terrestre a lo largo del tiempo. También la Luna, nuestro satélite natural, tiene un papel importante. Su atracción gravitatoria no solo es responsable de las mareas, sino también de pequeñas oscilaciones en el eje de rotación terrestre, conocidas como nutación y precesión.\nEstas variaciones no generan cambios bruscos inmediatos, pero sí producen efectos acumulativos con el paso del tiempo. Uno de ellos es el desplazamiento progresivo de los puntos de afelio y perihelio en el calendario. Este fenómeno, llamado precesión de los equinoccios, altera gradualmente la duración de las estaciones a lo largo de siglos.",
