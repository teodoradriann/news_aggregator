    "text": "Mumbai, Dec 28 T he Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in Mumbai has notched a series of achievements, innovative technological upgrades and world-class services to solidify its position as an aviation industry leader, an official said here on Thursday. he Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in Mumbai has notched a series of achievements, innovative technological upgrades and world-class services to solidify its position as an aviation industry leader, an official said here on Thursday. This year, the airport completed a major re-carpeting for Runway 14/32 to enhance overall efficiency, introduced Taxiway Z to reduce entry-exit times for aircraft and reduce carbon emissions, as first in the Asian region to offer a flexible-use apron. The CSMIA also became the first airport in Asia to commission a specialised Disabled Aircraft Recovery Kit (DARK), with high-pressure lifting bags. DARK ensures a superior and efficient recovery process for even the largest commercial aircraft, reinforcing CSMIA's commitment to safety and security. On November 25, the CSMIA notched the highest passenger traffic movement in a single day with 167,132 passengers travelling through CSMIA (over 120,000 domestic passengers and more than 46,000 international travellers). On November 11, the airport achieved a highest single-day record of 1,032 air traffic movements, or flights, surpassing its own previous record of 2018. Strengthening its connectivity, CSMIA announced its summer schedule with 14 per cent more weekly flight movements as compared to the summer schedule of 2022. Similarly, the Winter Schedule for 2023-2024 witnessed more than 950 daily flight movements, representing an 8-per cent increase compared to the previous year. With an extensive network connecting travellers to 115 different destinations, CSMIA continues to enhance connectivity for passengers. These were fuelled by an increased demand for domestic and international travel movement from CSMIA, which in turn benefits the travellers from Mumbai and neighbouring cities. The CSMIA also held a grand 70-day-long Summer Carnival in April 2023, offering captivating experiences and irresistible discounts across 100+ retail and FnB outlets. Aiming to become one of the world's best airports, the CSMIA has been working towards elevating its facilities and services to create a seamless passenger journey at the airport. The airport's Terminal 2 has been a major gateway offering exceptional infrastructure facilities aiding in the introduction of pioneering services and advanced technology. For this, the CSMIA installed 2D Barcode readers at the entry gates of Terminals 1&2, streamlining entry procedures and ensuring a hassle-free travel experience. The airport also introduced an Advanced Parking Guidance System at Terminal 2, a system that combines state-of-the-art technology with thoughtful design, ensuring travellers experience seamless and stress-free parking, to enhance passenger convenience. Aspiring to become net-zero by 2029, the CSMIA led in sustainability initiatives -- its commitment to becoming one of the first to eliminate Single-Use Plastic earned it the title of the 'Best Sustainable Airport of the Year' by ASSOCHAM. It also introduced Uber Green, the flagship electric vehicle service by Uber, for eco-friendly passenger mobility options. The prestigious Platinum Rating in Green Airports Recognition (GAR) Programme 2023 by the Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific highlighted the CSMIA's commitment to sustainability. The CSMIA is the first in India, the second in the Asia-Pacific region and the third globally, to receive this coveted recognition. During the year, the CSMIA's commitment to excellence bagged awards such as the 'Best Airport over 40 million passengers' for the year 2022 in the Asia Pacific region by ACI's Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards. Looking ahead to 2024, the CSMIA is poised for continued success in the coming year and beyond, setting new benchmarks and delivering excellence in air travel, said the officials.

    "text": "NEW YORK — A strong solar storm has brought a brilliant eruption of the Northern Lights that could maybe rival the dazzling global display of May 10. Reports of skies lit afire in color along the Eastern Time Zone where the sun had already set stretched from Boston through New York City, Washington, DC and even into the Southeast. 7 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NORTHERN LIGHTS NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center says there is currently a Level 4 \\\"Severe\\\" Geomagnetic Storm and may at times reach Level 5 \\\"Extreme\\\" levels on Thursday night, which would match the alert level from May 10’s storm that sparked near global auroras. For best viewing conditions, find a place away from city lights with a clear view of the northern horizon. Though some of the more intense displays in the northern latitudes may see the lights spread overhead and even shine through some light pollution. Having a camera that can film with longer exposures will yield spectacular photos. Geomagnetic effects could have impact on hurricane recovery The solar storm is forecast to continue through Friday after impacts from a coronal mass ejection began arriving to Earth on Thursday. The SWPC has been in contact with FEMA and state agencies involved in disaster recovery efforts because these storms could impact ongoing work across the Southeast from Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Geomagnetic storms and radiation from the Sun can affect the power grid, as well as GPS and radio blackouts and impacts on satellites. \\\"This storm could impact ongoing recovery efforts for Hurricanes Helene and Milton in several critical ways,\\\" the SPWC said.",

They gave us a helluva fight. \"Korengal\" makes a nice complement to \"Restrepo\" and should be an eye-opener for anyone curious about what guys go through in Afghanistan. My only complaint is I wish there was more action in it. I recently just published and e-book about it (available on Kindle, Nook, Kobo & Smashwords) entitled \"To Quell The Korengal\" if anyone is interested in reading more about it.\nGreat Movie\nWas shown made using a kick starter which makes it that more impressive for me with such a high caliber film. Its from the same prospective as Restrepo with the same Men and the same OP, but doesn't cover death and surviving, but more of dealing with boredom, how much they look forward to firefights, and how war effects you over a period of time to a point you begin to not care if you live or die. Its more physiological as Restrepo was emotional. At times it felt as a out takes of Restrepo but it really illustrates what war feels like from a theater seat. It places itself up there with Armadillo and Restrepo. Cant wait till its released on Netflix.\nReview: Korengal (2014) - War Journalism At It's Second Best\n2010's Restrepo brought the Afghanistan War in to peoples' homes, bearing visceral shots and the raw emotion of modern warfare. Photojournalist Tim Heatherington and Sebastian Junger spent ten months with Combat Outpost (COP) Restrepo's \"Battle Company\" reaping an inordinate amount of footage. More footage than they could place into the first documentary. A year later, Heatherington would be dead; killed by shrapnel whilst covering the 2011 Libyan Civil War. Junger felt that the copious amount of footage leftover from Restrepo lent itself to another film. Thusly, Korengal, a companion film, was born.\nWhere the prior of the pair seemed aimed to illustrate Chris Hedge's 2002 quote, \"The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug, one I ingested for many years,\" the latter shoots to exploit a more poignant and familial sense from the footage and interviews. For those familiar with Restrepo, do not expect anything revolutionary here. What you will be seeing is footage shot during the same time period (2007-2008) using the same equipment. That said, this is in no way a strike against the film. Junger fares well in his organization of the footage and new interviews. This is an altogether new narrative.\nAs a piece of war journalism, it stands out as a worthy companion piece to the first film, not only elaborating on notions explored in Restrepo's 93 minute running time, but introducing new and arguably more meaningful elements. Junger succeeds in revisiting their footage, and bringing freshness to what could have become a dull supercut of Restrepo's outtakes in another man's hands. It's a damn shame Heatherington wasn't around to see this complete vision of the creation he and Junger set out upon in 2007. These two pictures have set the standard for war journalism, and will hopefully usher in a new era of the discipline.\nRead more IMDb reviews",

    "text": "【大紀元2025年07月03日訊】（英文大紀元記者Jack Phillips報導／陳霆編譯）在週五（7月4日）美國國慶連假來臨之前，加州、伊利諾伊州、馬薩諸塞州、紐約州和華盛頓州等地關閉了若干海灘，原因是細菌濃度過高。\n加州聖地牙哥（San Diego）的官員已關閉至少六處海灘，因為細菌濃度可能超出健康標準，並建議泳客避免接觸封閉海灘的海水。\n聖地牙哥縣衛生局在7月1日發布的公告指出，強降雨可能導致城市逕流流入海洋與海灣，造成細菌濃度上升。\n公告指出：「這種污染會導致海洋與海灣水域的細菌顯著增加，尤其是在排水渠道（storm drains）、河流和潟湖出水口附近。」\n在伊利諾伊州，該州公共衛生部表示，截至目前，位於芝加哥郊區的麥克亨利縣（McHenry County）已有三處海灘因細菌濃度過高而關閉。根據該縣網站，毗鄰芝加哥市的萊克縣（Lake County）也有大約六處海灘因細菌濃度過高而關閉。\n華盛頓州金縣（King County）在6月30日更新的海灘地圖中表示，當地已有四處海灘因「海灘細菌」超標而關閉，並提醒泳客「不要下水」，其中包括普吉特灣（Puget Sound）水道沿岸的海灘。\n金縣轄下包括了西雅圖地區，該縣在網站更新中表示：「請勿在以下游泳海灘下水：普里查德島海灘（Pritchard Island Beach）和西格林湖海灘（West Green Lake Beach）。」\n在紐約州長島（Long Island），蘇福克縣（Suffolk County）官員表示，位於灣岸（Bay Shore）的本傑明海灘（Benjamin Beach）、艾斯利普鎮（Town of Islip）的朗康可馬海灘（Ronkonkoma Beach），以及位於塞維爾（Sayville）的塞維爾濱海公園海灘（Sayville Marina Park Beach）因發現「細菌濃度超出可接受標準」而關閉，禁止游泳。\n該縣在更新中援引當地衛生官員的說法指出：「在受細菌污染的水域中游泳，可能導致腸胃疾病，以及眼睛、耳朵、鼻子和喉嚨的感染。」該關閉令將持續至7月2日。\n長島的另一個縣——拿索縣（Nassau County）已自6月25日起，因細菌濃度升高而關閉格蘭科夫（Glen Cove）的摩根海灘（Morgan Beach）。該縣尚未公布重新開放時間，只表示將持續關閉，直到檢測顯示細菌濃度符合標準為止。\n拿索縣在更新中表示，位於馬薩佩夸（Massapequa）的比爾特莫爾海灘俱樂部（Biltmore Beach Club）「因細菌濃度升高，在另行通知前將持續關閉」。\n與此同時，馬薩諸塞州公共衛生部7月2日在網站上表示，該州已有少數海灘因細菌濃度過高而關閉。\n不過，根據該機構發布的地圖和數據，該州絕大多數海灘仍然是開放的。\n美國疾病控制與預防中心（CDC）在網站上警告，一種被稱為弧菌（vibrio）的細菌可能存在於沿海水域中，會引起一系列症狀，包括腹瀉、胃痙攣、嘔吐和發燒、皮膚感染以及低血壓等。\n根據CDC的說法，某些類型的弧菌可能會引發壞死性筋膜炎（necrotizing fasciitis），即「開放性傷口周圍組織壞死的嚴重感染」。一些媒體指出，弧菌中的「創傷弧菌」（Vibrio vulnificus），是一種「食肉」的菌種。\n不過，海灘也可能因其他類型細菌而被關閉，例如大腸桿菌（E. Coli）、沙門氏菌（salmonella）、志賀氏菌（shigella）等，以及腸道寄生蟲，如梨形鞭毛蟲（giardia）和隱孢子蟲（cryptosporidium）等。\n原文： ‘High Bacteria’ Warnings Issued for Beaches Across US Ahead of Fourth of July 刊登於英文《大紀元時報》\n責任編輯：李沐恩#",

Good morning, West Michigan! Today is a WEATHER ALERT DAY, one of two back-to-back. Though we'll see areas of snow this morning and early afternoon, the impactful weather for this alert day won't arrive in full force until late in the afternoon. A cold front will arrive around sunset triggering snow showers. Behind the front, the coldest air we've had since last January plows into West Michigan, triggering numerous lake effect snow showers in west to east oriented snow bands. The snow will likely be heavy at times through Thursday morning, when a shift in the wind will quickly shut down the snow bands. But before that happens, some parts of West Michigan, especially in the snow belt west of US 131, may see up to 10\\\" of snow. Add to that a sometimes-gusty west wind, and you have a recipe for hazardous driving with icy, snow-covered roads, and periods of reduced visibility. Occasional whiteouts are possible. The snow ends quickly Thursday, diminishing by early afternoon thanks to a shift in the wind. Our best chance for sunshine -- and it isn't great -- is Friday as temperatures start to warm. A wintry mix in the morning is how we begin Saturday with freezing rain possibly playing a part. Temps warm to the upper 30s Saturday and lower 40s Sunday, both afternoon's having a chance for rain. Meteorologist Jeff Porter updates the outlook LIVE this morning on News Channel 3. Catch his LIVE reports from 4:30 to 9:00. Have a wonderful Wednesday! \",\"forecast\":",

    "title": "St. Cloud Woman Becomes Beacon of Hope in North Carolina After Devastating Storm",
    "text": "(KNSI) — When the clouds finally parted over the mountains in North Carolina, a woman from St. Cloud stepped up to comfort her neighbors and rescuers. Debbie Newcomb spent most of her youth in St. Cloud and graduated from Tech High School. She and her husband, Rob, moved to Alexander, NC, about 11 miles north of Asheville, in 1988, where they built a home and a life. That all changed in late September when a massive rainstorm met the remnants of Hurricane Helene, leading to torrential rainfall. Rob told KNSI News the landscape has been forever altered. “The pictures and video footage that you’ve seen on TV don’t show the true magnitude of the damage and the destruction.” The deluge led to 500 mudslides, which sent trees crashing all over the mountain and washed out nearly 300 bridges. The Newcombs say they were relatively unaffected, aside from the loss of 40 trees, thanks to a home generator, solar power, a well and a portable internet unit. After making sure their friends and family were safe, Debbie told KNSI that since they had been spared by the wrath of the weather, they knew they had to help whoever they could. “We brought water to people. We brought other supplies. I had excess food and brought that down. And during the day, I invited some people to come out here and use my house for whatever. And so people were coming and going and doing laundry, and that’s kind of been going on since the beginning.” While parked in a mountaintop clearing to use the internet on behalf of neighbors who couldn’t communicate with their loved ones, the couple saw a car drive up with a family whose ten-day-old baby was in distress. The family was waiting for a helicopter to take the child to a hospital. While the Newcombs waited with them, a crew of eight Florida State Guard Special Operations members showed up to help the chopper land and take the child to safety. Debbie opened her home to the rescue squad and was able to host them for several days, along with two members of the Florida Fish and Game Department. The members stayed at Debbie’s house until they were called back home to deal with Hurricane Milton. “And so we said farewell to them, but I will tell you, these people, in a matter of days, have become like family to me, and they will forever be my heroes.” Recovery efforts are still underway as officials search for missing people. Numerous neighborhoods are still dealing with downed trees on houses. It could be four to six months before power is completely restored to rural mountain communities. The region is working on reopening schools by the end of the month. ___ Copyright 2024 Leighton Media. All rights reserved.

    "text": "By Talib Visram 3 minute Read The “Alberta Clipper” storm system that hung over parts of Western Canada this weekend brought heavy snow to cities like Winnipeg, where temperatures dropped to -13 degrees Fahrenheit. But one unlikely savior helped alleviate the icy road conditions: the humble beet.\nWe tend to think of salt as the primary means to clear icy roads, but it’s not the only substance in the toolbox. For years, many municipalities have used a natural substance—beet juice—which lowers the need for salt, bringing down both costs and environmental risks.\nThe use of beets as a deicer is prevalent in North America. As frigid temperatures set in across the country, states from Pennsylvania to North Dakota will be spreading beet juice across roads and bridges.\nIt’s not the jarred stuff from the grocery aisle (don’t try to clear your driveway with that). Rather, it’s a waste byproduct of sugar beet molasses that’s an ingredient used to produce table sugar crystals. It’s sticky like molasses and dark in color.\n“We haven’t found a state that doesn’t use it that deals with any kind of winter operations,” says Becky Allmeroth, chief safety and operations officer at the Missouri Department of Transportation, which was an early adopter about 20 years ago, following Iowa.\nStates and municipalities buy the beet juice concentrate from various suppliers, including ones called Beet 55 and Beet Heet; Missouri’s supplier of choice is GeoMelt. They mix it with liquid salt brine to dilute it, which keeps costs down, because brine is cheap. This mixing is common, including in D.C., where the mayor’s team cryptically referred to the cocktail as “hot mix.”\nBeets plus brine works much better than brine alone. Because it’s so sticky, it stays on roads for longer, keeping them clear for four to five days instead of one to two, saving manpower and time.\nIt’s used not only to deice roads, but also to prevent frost from forming in the first place. In Missouri, when beets are in play, they only use 10% of the salt for brine that they’d normally use. “When you’re purchasing almost $10 million worth of salt,” Allmeroth says, “that’s where you start seeing millions of dollars worth of savings.”\nSometimes, officials use solid rock salt, which makes its own brine with the snow and rain. They often pre-wet the salt with the beet juice mix. It sticks to the salt, and makes it heavier so it remains on the roadway. “When it goes out the backside of our spreaders, it will not scatter and bounce into the ditches,” Allmeroth says.\nThe beet juice also works at lower temperatures than salt alone. Salt works by lowering the freezing point of water, putting off the creation of ice; beets bind with the salt to lower the freezing point even further. Salt loses its effectiveness when you get below about 25 degrees, but GeoMelt’s freezing point is at about -40.\nadvertisement That’s essential north of the border, where temperatures drop to frigid levels. Michael Cantor, manager of streets maintenance in Winnipeg, Manitoba , often uses sand instead of salt because it provides better tire traction in dangerous conditions; beets work the same way with sand. They used more than 396,000 liters of beet mixture last season, and closer to 849,000 in the heavier season of 2019-2020.\nAlleviating the use of road salt could also be a boon for the environment, given that the U.S. and Canada use more than 33 metric tons of it annually. When it runs off into streams, the chloride can contaminate drinking water and be toxic to various species. A recent study also suggested a surplus of salt disrupts the Earth’s natural salt cycle , which could prove an “existential threat.”\nBeet juice is more sustainable. There’s also plenty being produced: Michigan sugar beet growers said they could likely produce enough to spray all the roads in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.\nThe beet juice has some environmental concerns of its own: Researchers found that phosphates in the juice can spur algae growth in waterways, and that its potassium could detrimentally affect species like mayflies .\nBut it’s spurred thinking about how other natural substances could be used to deice roads: Some municipalities have trialed pickle juice, potato juice, and cheese brine —the latter in Wisconsin, of course.\nFor Allmeroth, the downsides are mainly sensory. One: it reeks. “If you get a whiff of it, it really smells,” she says, so pungently that officials place signs to warn passersby after a recent deployment. And it’s sticky, which can be a hassle if the goop hits a windshield. “I can usually get it off with a quick run through the carwash,” she says. “But it’s not pleasant.”",

    "text": "IMPACT through upcycling and recycling credits on PCX Markets, which helps fund plastic waste recovery, skyrocketed by 1,500 percent in 2023 as large corporations looked for new ways to meet sustainability goals and compliance requirements. The sale of those credits helped fund the upcycling or recycling of 9,000,000 kg plastic waste last year alone.\nThe jump in demand for credits issued by recycling and upcycling projects, which channel much-needed funding into the waste management sector, illustrates how the Philippines' new Extended Producer Responsibility Act is fueling the effective and economically viable development of a circular economy.\nOne of the projects on the PCX Markets platform is an upcycler based in Bulacan that uses plastics from beverage cartons and other low-value flexible items, like sachets, to create boards for use in construction and furniture. An overall rise in demand for credits in 2023 helped support this upcycler's operating costs; as a result, they aim to triple their processing capacity by September of 2024.\nPET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles rank as one of the most recycled and upcycled waste materials. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Another project on the marketplace, based in Davao, recycles PET bottles into flakes that can be used in various products such as plastic containers, PET straps and fibers used in clothing. Rising demand for credits has helped reduce the volatility brought on by fluctuations in demand for flakes, giving this recycler the confidence to invest in more capacity for 2024 and beyond. The recycler estimates that the new infrastructure will allow them to process an additional 1 million kg of plastic waste into flakes every month, representing a 15 percent increase over last year.",
