    "text": "By Sara Wilson ,\n3 hours ago A view of the Colorado Capitol on May 4, 2024. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)\nThe Colorado Legislature could amend its workplace harassment policy to allow those at the center of a complaint an opportunity to respond much earlier than they can now.\nA proposed change to the policy would require someone from the Office of Legal Services to interview the respondent — the person named in the complaint — about the allegations before initiating the formal resolution process.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nDepending on that interview, the office could decide the complaint was false or made in bad faith and dismiss it entirely before initiating an investigation.\n“Our members were giving us feedback that they were concerned about false complaints. We are not a typical workplace environment, and the concern that I heard from members was, what if there’s a politically motivated complaint that comes forward and that there is no basis for the complaint?” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said during a Thursday meeting of the Legislative Council, which is composed of party leadership from both chambers.\nReaching out to respondents that early in the process is not common industry practice for workplace harassment investigations. Currently, respondents don’t have an opportunity to discuss details of the allegation against them before that investigative process begins.\nAdditionally, under the proposed policy change, filing a false complaint or in bad faith would violate the harassment policy.\n“A person who abuses the process — this process itself could be used to potentially penalize them,” said Ed DeCecco, director of the Office of Legislative Legal Services.\nIf the complainant withdraws the allegation, the respondent under the proposed change could choose to have their response included in the complaint record.\nThe group did not take a vote on the new policy.\nThe House Workplace Harassment committee has met one time, in May 2023, since its creation in 2019. The Senate version of the committee has never met. During the 2023 meeting, the House panel determined that the complaint at hand, which was not disclosed, fell under the policy’s scope and hired a third-party investigator. They have not met since. Investigation summaries are made public only if the committee determines a state lawmaker violated the harassment policy.\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\nThe post Concerns over false harassment complaints prompts Colorado Legislature to weigh policy change appeared first on Colorado Newsline .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "L'Australien Nick Kyrgios s'est offert sa première victoire en simple depuis octobre 2022. Il a battu l'Américain Mackenzie McDonald mercredi au 1er tour du Masters 1000 de Miami.\nLongtemps écarté des courts à cause de blessures, le finaliste de Wimbledon en 2022 s'est imposé 3-6 6-3 6-4 contre le 101e mondial. Il affrontera au 2e tour le Russe Karen Khachanov (ATP 23), exempté de 1er tour.\nKyrgios n'avait plus remporté de match en simple sur le circuit ATP depuis le début du mois d'octobre 2022 et une victoire au 2e tour du tournoi ATP 500 de Tokyo. A l'exception d'une défaite au premier tour à Stuttgart en juin 2023, l'Australien n'a disputé aucun match durant les saisons 2023 et 2024.\nDepuis son retour sur les courts au début de la saison 2025, Kyrgios avait jusqu'ici enchaîné trois défaites de rang, à Brisbane, à l'Open d'Australie et à Indian Wells. Lors de ce dernier tournoi, il avait à nouveau dû abandonner au milieu de la deuxième manche contre le Néerlandais Botic van de Zandschulp en raison de douleurs au poignet.\n'Je suis encore là, mais si je ne suis pas capable de finir les matches, à quoi bon... Je ne sais pas', avait glissé Kyrgios, dépité, après son abandon.\n/ATS",

Publicidad El Hormiguero ha cerrado su semana por todo lo alto con la visita de Miguel López-Alegría. El astronauta ha visitado el programa para hablarnos de su extensa carrera y para acercarnos de alguna manera a la vida en el espacio. Después de contarnos cómo es vivir durante siete meses en el espacio y de contestar varias de las preguntas de Pablo Motos sobre la complejidad de su trabajo, Miguel López-Alegría ha recibido una grata sorpresa al ver parte del documental que está preparando su hijo sobre su vida. El joven ha guardado los mensajes que su padre le mandaba antes de emprender una nueva misión durante años y ha terminado el vídeo con un mensaje actual lleno de palabras bonitas hacia su referente. \"Estas imágenes de aquel tiempo en la estación me dan muchos recuerdos. Es un poco duro ver esto\", ha confesado emocionado después de ver el vídeo de su hijo. ¡Dale play al vídeo y revive este momentazo al completo! Publicidad",
