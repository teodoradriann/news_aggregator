    "title": "World energy methane emissions near record high in 2024: IEA",
    "text": "PARIS: Record fossil fuel production kept planet-heating methane emissions near historic highs last year, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday, warning of a surge in massive leaks from oil and gas facilities.\nSlashing emissions of methane — second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming — is essential to meeting international targets on climate change and one of the fastest ways to curb temperature rise. But the IEA warned that countries are considerably underestimating their energy sector methane pollution, estimating that emissions are around 80 percent higher than the total reported by governments to the United Nations.\nThe energy sector is responsible for around a third of the methane emitted by human activities. It leaks from gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, and is also deliberately released during equipment maintenance. Tackling this is considered one of the easiest ways to lower emissions because plugging leaks can often be done at little or no cost.\n“However, the latest data indicates that implementation on methane has continued to fall short of ambitions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.\n‘Super-emitters’\nThe IEA’s Global Methane Tracker report said over 120 million tonnes was released from the fossil fuel sector in 2024, close to the record high in 2019. China has the largest energy methane emissions globally, mainly from its coal sector.\nThe United States follows in second, driven by its oil and gas sector, with Russia third. The IEA said its figures are based on measured data where possible, compared to emissions reported by governments, which can be outdated or estimated using information from the energy sector. Global methane emissions are becoming easier to monitor from space, with more than 25 satellites tracking gas plumes from fossil fuel facilities and other sources.\nThe IEA said that Europe’s Sentinel 5 satellite, which just sees the very largest leaks, showed that “super-emitting methane events” at oil and gas facilities rose to a record high in 2024. These huge leaks were observed all over the world, but particularly in the United States, Turkmenistan and Russia.\nAbandoned oil and gas wells, and coal mines are also significant sources of methane leaking into the atmosphere, the IEA said in new analysis for this year’s report. When taken together they would be the “world’s fourth-largest emitter of fossil fuel methane”, accounting for some eight million tonnes last year.\n‘Tremendous impact’\nSome 40pc of methane emissions come from natural sources, mainly wetlands. The rest are from human activities, particularly agriculture and the energy sector. Because methane is potent but relatively short-lived it is a key target for countries wanting to slash emissions quickly.\nMore than 150 countries have promised a 30pc reduction by 2030. Oil and gas firms have meanwhile pledged to slash methane emissions by 2050. The IEA estimated that cutting methane released by the fossil fuel sector would significantly slow global warming, preventing a roughly 0.1 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures by 2050.\n“This would have a tremendous impact — comparable to eliminating all CO2 emissions from the world’s heavy industry in one stroke,” the report said.\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",

    "text": "BETHLEHEM, Pa. - The owners of a family-run bakery in Northampton County are no longer moving forward with plans to open a sister location in Bethlehem.\nThe operators of Let Them Eat Cake, a French Regency-inspired bakery offering elegant cakes, cupcakes, macarons and more at 112 S. Main St. in Nazareth, have decided not to move forward with opening a sister location - Let Them Drink Tea - in Bethlehem, according to an announcement on Let Them Eat Cake and Let Them Drink Tea's social media pages.\nIn early May, the owners announced plans to open Let Them Drink Tea - a tea room specializing in morning and afternoon tea - this summer at 306 Brodhead Ave. in south Bethlehem.\n\"After much thought and consideration, we have made the difficult decision not to move forward with opening Let Them Drink Tea in Bethlehem, PA,\" the announcement reads.\n\"We know this news may come as a disappointment to some, and we deeply appreciate the enthusiasm and support we've received. At this time, we kindly ask for understanding, kindness, and compassion as we navigate this transition. We will not be answering any questions at this time and thank you for respecting that boundary.\"\nLast month, co-owner Taylor Romero told 69 News that Let Them Drink Tea would be an extension of Let Them Eat Cake and operate in a similar fashion to the Nazareth location, but it wouldn't be an \"exact replica.\"\nRomero and her mother, Channon Smyly, debuted Let Them Eat Cake in June 2023 at its former location at 143 S. Main St. in Nazareth.\nLast year, the mother-daughter duo decided to move the bakery about 90 yards away from its original spot to its current 112 S. Main St. location to expand operations.\nLet Them Eat Cake operates at 112 S. Main St. in Nazareth.\nRyan Kneller In moving to the new space, new features were added to “amplify the experience” at Let Them Eat Cake.\nNew aspects include private parties; macaron technique and cake classes; and high tea experiences for individuals looking to “indulge in the finger things” with warm, artisanal teas and sweet and savory bites.\nOver the past year, the Let Them Eat Cake team has hosted various themed events such as princess tea parties, a Bridgerton-themed week and a Star Wars-inspired afternoon tea.\nThe high tea events have proven very popular, with the Nazareth bakery being fully booked nearly every week, Romero said.\nLet Them Eat Cake The Let Them Drink Tea venue in Bethlehem was intended to build on this popularity, with guests able to enjoy morning and afternoon teas, featuring an assortment of fine teas served alongside delicate pastries, scones, finger sandwiches and more.\nPlans for Let Them Drink Tea also included selling fresh baked goods such as brownies, cupcakes, macarons and scones, along with drinks such as French-pressed coffee and iced coffee.\nIn response to the Let Them Drink Tea announcement, community members are extending words of encouragement to the Let Them Eat Cake team.\n\"So sorry to hear this!\" one person commented on Let Them Eat Cake's Facebook post. \"Doesn't change how I feel as a customer, which is: You're Da Best!!!\"\n\"I'm just glad Let them Eat Cake will still be open,\" another person wrote. \"We love it!\"\nFor the latest Let Them Eat Cake updates, follow the business' pages on Facebook and Instagram .\nCLICK HERE for more Eat, Sip, Shop Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "text": "Keys to success include communication, effective exposure to a target audience, and Roy Frank’s additional offer of an open listing\n(PRUnderground) February 29th, 2024\nListing a property is one thing but getting it local and national exposure ongoingly can be a challenge. The National Real Estate Investors Network has proclaimed Roy Frank the best for getting results in listing and buying real estate investment properties. The price of real estate is a key function of moving real estate. But the next biggest function of selling investment property is exposure.\nMark Maupin, who runs the largest Real Estate Investors Network Meetup in Michigan (National Real Estate Investors Network) with over 7000 members says, “Boy oh Boy Roy Frank not only lists the property for the investor in the MLS but goes way beyond anyone on getting the property the exposure it needs to get it sold.”\nProfessionally created flyers are being sent out daily. Flyers are posted to Facebook groups for local Real Estate agents and investors, and to Facebook groups throughout the United States, for those who invest nationwide. Communication is key to keeping the seller informed throughout the process with proof of daily posting emailed to the investor. Flyers are emailed to over 40,000 investors on Meetup in 8 major cities. With all this exposure, if the property does not get activity, the seller will know that there is a problem with the deal, most likely, the price is too high. Incredibly, Roy will do an open listing where if the seller finds the buyer himself, then Mr. Frank is owed no commission.\nRoy Frank also serves investor buyers, with a network of marketing for agents who are looking for great investment properties to purchase. Roy is a listing and selling broker for investors, both residential and commercial. In addition, his company is also accepting and selling donated properties nationwide.

Para todo ello quieren volver a reunirse con la Diputación.\nAunque en un inicio pretendían entrar al interior del edificio, finalmente se ha hecho la entrega de los documentos en el exterior.\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para registrados.\nComentar es una ventaja exclusiva para registrados\n¿Ya eres registrado?\nNecesitas ser suscriptor para poder votar.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "title": "In Italia in 9 mesi +40% di corse a emissioni 0, i monopattini elettrici i più utilizzati",
    "text": "Nelle strade delle nostre città siamo ormai sempre più abituati a vedere monopattini elettrici scorrazzare qua e là ma anche a utilizzarli. Questo piccolo mezzi di trasporto sta infatti conquistando sempre più persone, di fasce d’età differente, che ne apprezzano la comodità per i piccoli spostamenti urbani: grazie a questi mezzi di trasporto smart è infatti possibile evitare di restare imbottigliati nel traffico, come spesso accade alle automobili, e risparmiare anche il tempo che altrimenti sarebbe destinato alla ricerca di un parcheggio. Per comprendere a fondo i motivi del successo dei monopattini elettrici non bisogna dimenticare la questione ambientale: la società di oggi è sempre più attenta e sensibile alle tematiche ambientali e per questo motivo in molti cercano soluzione alternative, a zero emissioni, per effettuare i propri spostamenti e i monopattini risultano essere i mezzi elettrici più utilizzati.\nIndice\nMonopattini elettrici in Italia: quanto vengono utilizzati\nNel corso della Milano Green Week 2024, Freeenow ha presentato tutti i vari dati riguardo la micromobilità sostenibile. Analizzandoli emerge che nei primi nove mesi dell’anno, c’è stato un aumento del 40% di corse a emissioni zero, quindi spostamenti utilizzando monopattini elettrici o anche altri veicoli a zero emissioni come eScooters ed eBikes.\nIl mezzo elettrico più utilizzato, come dicevamo, è il monopattino, basti pensare che finora sono state circa 65.000 le corse a bordo di questi mezzi nel 2024. Quelle a bordo degli eScooters sono state poche meno, circa 60.000, quelle invece a bordo di eBikes sono state circa 42.000.\nMonopattini elettrici: le città italiane dove vengono più utilizzati\nLa città italiana dove in assoluto i monopattini elettrici sono più utilizzati è Milano: a rivelarlo sono sempre i dati che sono stati diffusi da Freenow. Nei primi nove mesi del 2024 sono state registrate oltre 100.000 corse da parte dei milanesi o di chi si trovava in città a bordo di questi mezzi.\nIn questa particolare graduatoria Roma si piazza al secondo posto: sono circa 50.000 le corse a bordo di monopattini elettrici che sono state registrate da gennaio a settembre compreso. Chiude il podio Torino: nel capoluogo di regione del Piemonte le corse registrate sono state invece 30.000.\nLa classifica rimane invariate anche tenendo in considerazioni l’utilizzo degli altri mezzo a zero emissioni: al primo posto resta Milano, con 105.000 corse effettuate sui mezzi elettrici per la micromobilità, al secondo Roma con 50.000 corse, al terzo Torino. La città piemontese, inoltre, è leader nazionale per numero di eBikes a disposizione degli utenti (circa 2.000) ed è alterno posto per quel che riguarda il numero di eScooters.\nL’Italia Paese leader della micromobilità urbana sostenibili\nI dati riguardanti il trasporto urbano rivelano però anche un altro dato molto interessato: l’Italia è il Paese europeo leader per quel che riguarda la micromobilità urbana sostenibile. L’Italia è anche la nazione che offre ai cittadini il maggior numero di monopattini elettrici. Seguono nazioni come la Germania, la Spagna e la Francia.\nL’Italia è anche nelle prime tre posizioni tra i vari Paesi europei per quanto riguarda la disponibilità e l’utilizzo di altri mezzi di trasporto elettrici, come eScooters e eBikes.",

    "text": "Ciudad del Vaticano.- Numerosos fieles que han acudido este domingo a la plaza de San Pedro del Vaticano han mostrado su esperanza en la recuperación del papa Francisco, después de que su salud se agravase este sábado al sufrir una crisis respiratoria que le mantiene en estado “crítico”.\n“Sabemos el estado del papa y esperamos que se mejore y que se recupere pronto. Deseamos todo lo mejor”, dijeron a EFE Gloria y Arnaldo Díaz, una pareja paraguaya que vive en la localidad española de Málaga desde hace 20 años.\n“Y vamos a rezar por él también para que se ponga bien pronto”, añadieron, mientras el italiano Simone también mostró su “esperanza es que se recupere”, aunque “hace poco nos han dicho que la situación ha empeorado”.\nExplicó que había ido a la basílica de San Pedro “para la misa (del Jubileo de los Diáconos), pero nos han dicho que el papa no vendrá porque está enfermo. Esperamos que mejore lo antes posible, que así sea”.\nGennaro Sorrentino, de Nápoles (sur), se mostró muy afectado por la enfermedad del pontífice: “Soy católico, y he venido a la plaza de San Pedro a rezar por el papa, que ahora está viviendo un momento de sufrimiento”.\n“La oración es la única posibilidad que tenemos ahora para acompañarle en estos momentos”, añadió.\nFrancisco, hospitalizado en el hospital Gemelli desde hace diez días,\npasó una noche tranquila y descansó, informó este domingo el Vaticano, después de que ayer sábado se agravase su salud al sufrir una crisis respiratoria por la que se le tuvo que suministrar oxígeno. También requirió transfusiones de sangre debido a una anemia.\nEn el último parte médico se comunicó que “el estado del Santo Padre continúa siendo crítico” y que “por el momento está en pronóstico reservado”, tras sufrir “una crisis respiratoria asmática prolongada, que requirió también la aplicación de oxígeno de alto flujo”.\nAdemás añadía que “los análisis de sangre realizados hoy también revelaron trombocitopenia (plaquetas en sangre en cantidad inferior al normal), asociada a la anemia, que requirió la administración de transfusiones de sangre”.\nY señalaba que Francisco sigue “alerta” y “pasó el día sentado en el sillón” aunque con más molestias que el día anterior”, añadió la nota.\nMientras tanto, en el Vaticano continúan los actos del Jubileo y hoy se celebra el dedicado a los diáconos. En sustitución del papa Francisco ofició la misa en la basílica de san Pedro el pro-prefecto del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella.\nEl papa tampoco pronunciará el rezo dominical del Ángelus, sólo se difundirá el texto escrito por él como la semana pasada.",
