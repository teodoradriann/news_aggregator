    "text": "Thaïlande: 61 morts en raison des chaleurs extrêmes depuis le début de l'année © MANAN VATSYAYANA, AFP - Un carrefour à Bangkok, le 25 avril 2024 en Thaïlande où une vague de chaleur extrême est attendue En Thaïlande, 61 personnes sont mortes depuis le début de l'année en raison de la chaleur extrême qui a frappé le pays pendant des semaines, a déclaré le ministère de la Santé vendredi. Pendant près d'une semaine en avril, les autorités de Bangkok ont émis quotidiennement des avertissements de chaleur extrême, la \"température ressentie\" ayant dépassé les 52°C. Selon un communiqué du ministère, 61 personnes sont mortes d'insolation à travers le pays depuis le début de l'année 2024, contre 37 pendant toute l'année 2023. Le nord-est de la Thaïlande, essentiellement constitué de terres agricoles, a connu le plus grand nombre de décès, a précisé le ministère. Le changement climatique induit par l'homme entraînera des canicules plus fréquentes, plus longues et plus intenses, avertissent régulièrement les scientifiques. Si le phénomène El Niño contribue au climat exceptionnellement chaud de cette année, l'Asie se réchauffe également plus rapidement que la moyenne mondiale, selon l'Organisation météorologique mondiale de l'ONU. Apichart Vachiraphan, responsable du service de contrôle des maladies au ministère thaïlandais, a conseillé aux personnes souffrant de problèmes de santé sous-jacents de limiter leurs sorties. Cette année, un temps chaud et sec a perduré plus longtemps que d'habitude sur le pays, où la saison des pluies tarde à arriver. Des orages ont éclaté cette semaine dans certaines régions, faisant baisser les températures mais conduisant les autorités à mettre en garde contre les inondations soudaines. En avril, le royaume a enregistré une température de 44,2°C dans la province de Lampang (nord), tout près du record national enregistré l'an dernier à 44,6°C. publié le 10 mai à 11h56, AFP",

    "title": "Former UK minister of state criticizes Conservative leadership hopeful Jenrick’s stance on Palestine",
    "text": "LONDON: A former UK minister of state has condemned the Conservative Party leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick, calling him an “extremist” and warning that his position on Israel and Palestine would make him a “disaster” as leader of the party.\nAlan Duncan was speaking in a video interview with Palestinian journalist Ahmed Alnaouq, which was published on Thursday by Palestine Deep Dive.\nDuring the interview, Duncan highlighted Jenrick’s controversial statements at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month, where Jenrick vowed to build the British Embassy in Jerusalem if the Foreign Office did not agree to relocate it.\n“This man is an extremist. He does not believe in any kind of two-state solution although he says he does, he knows nothing about it. He takes his script entirely from the Conservative Friends of Israel and the Israelis, so he would be a disaster if he were leader of the Conservative Party,” Duncan said.\nDuncan, who most recently served as UK minister of state for Europe and the Americas from 2016 to 2019 in the Conservative government of the time, also criticized the influence of lobbying organizations such as Conservative Friends of Israel, accusing them of shaping UK foreign policy on Israel.\nHe described how donor money and back channels have influenced Conservative Party decisions, saying: “It goes straight into number 10 Downing Street” and “tells the Foreign Office what to do.”\nDuncan expressed skepticism about the Conservative government’s commitment to its official stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nWhile the UK’s stated policy views Israeli settlements as illegal and supports the establishment of a Palestinian state, Duncan claimed that senior Conservative officials did not genuinely believe in these policies.\n“They didn’t really believe in international law as far as I can see,” he added, accusing them of hypocrisy when it came to Israel.\nWhen asked about Kemi Badenoch, the other Conservative leadership contender, Duncan admitted that he was unsure of her stance on foreign policy. He lamented the lack of experience and understanding of the Middle East among UK politicians.\n“I haven’t got a clue what her views are on foreign policy, I simply do not know,” he said. “And it’s one of the problems of all British politics now is that those in Parliament have got no real experience of the region, they haven’t really learned the history and they just have very, very simple attitudes and this is dangerous.”\nDuncan’s scathing remarks underscored growing divisions within the Conservative Party over its approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as leadership hopefuls such as Jenrick adopt increasingly hard-line positions.\nHe also took aim at former UK government minister Michael Gove.\n“Now one thing that was a disgrace was (Michael Gove) when he was minister, who is another completely sold-out sympathizer of Israeli extremism,” he said.\n“He passed a law which said that local councils were not allowed to have a policy of boycotting Israeli produce even if they’re illegal, so you end up with one arm of the UK government saying Palestinian settlements are illegal and another arm of British government protecting illegal activity in those Palestinian settlements, and Parliament was pathetic in opposing this piece of legislation.”\nDuncan also said that not enough value was placed on Palestinian lives by the British political class.\n“I don’t think people in Parliament are sitting there and thinking quite what the devastation of the Gaza Strip actually looks like and means to people in terms of human suffering,” he said.\n“They don’t even stop to think about it. Someone like Jenrick says: ‘Oh well, you know Hamas are dreadful, we’ve got to eliminate them,’ as if you can. I mean, he says nothing about the origins of this problem. So, he is a disgrace,” he said.\nThe former minister also criticized the current Labour government’s lack of a genuine commitment to a two-state solution, dismissing the rhetoric from both major parties as “waffle” and a reflection of ignorance about the situation on the ground.\nDuncan’s candid remarks are likely to reignite debate about the UK’s foreign policy direction, particularly as the Conservative Party prepares to select its next leader.",

    "title": "Cloud Detection and Response: A Cybersecurity Imperative for Small Businesses",
    "text": "Most Small Businesses Not Protected Against Today’s Biggest Cyber Threat, Warns Cybersecurity Software CEO.\nAs today’s small businesses continue their digital transformation, more and more are falling victim to\ncybersecurity threats that can have devastating consequences. Despite a common misconception that hackers only go after large companies, the fact is that small-to-midsized businesses (SMBs) make increasingly attractive targets with recent studies revealing that 61% of SMBs suffered a successful cyberattack in 2023.\nCybersecurity software CEO, Jim Lippie of\nSaaS Alerts has been making it his mission to educate small to midsized businesses and the Managed IT Service Providers (MSPs) – who those businesses rely on for their IT and cybersecurity needs – about what he sees as the single greatest security risk and the need for SMBs to leverage cloud detection and response (CDR) capabilities as part of their overall cyber defense arsenal.\nMost small businesses now use cloud-native applications for their daily operations with recent reports suggesting that\n85% of all business apps will be SaaS-based by 2025. The result? Cybercriminals have now evolved beyond the targeting of devices and are directly targeting cloud-based applications and the users of those applications. Lippie says, “While endpoint detection and response (EDR), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Microsoft’s conditional access policies are important layers in a strong security posture, they do not go far enough to protect the small businesses of today. Cloud detection and response is now essential for every business’s defense”.\nLippie’s firm, SaaS Alerts provides SaaS monitoring and alerting with automated remediation capabilities that allow MSPs better to protect their SMB clients from such cloud-based threats. He warns businesses, “The need for robust CDR capabilities has now emerged as a critical imperative for small businesses – and those small businesses should be asking their Managed Service Provider partners to offer this necessary protection”.\nThe Imperative of Cloud Detection and Response\nAs an example of the current cyberattack methods being deployed against small businesses which EDR and other traditional security measures are not catching, Lippie points to Token hijacking. Token hijacking occurs when an unauthorized user accesses an account by stealing the session token. “I believe that this type of attack is currently the single greatest threat to a small business. We see approximately 2,500 of these attacks per day against the 30,000 businesses currently being monitored by our cybersecurity solution”.\nA token is a secure, unique identifier used to authenticate a user’s identity and maintain session integrity during interactions with a system or application. By stealing this token, the attacker can bypass both conditional access and MFA to gain direct access to the account. With a cloud detection and response solution enabled, a business (and/or their MSP partner) is able to proactively detect and respond to any unusual activity that suggests a potential token hijacking attack.\nThe Role of Managed Service Providers\nManaged service providers (MSPs) and Managed security service providers (MSSPs) play a crucial role in supporting small businesses in their journey towards robust cloud security. By offering CDR as part of their managed services portfolio, MSPs can provide small enterprises with access to advanced security capabilities without the need for significant in-house expertise or upfront investments.\nMSPs can leverage their specialized knowledge and experience to implement and manage CDR solutions tailored to the unique needs of small businesses. This approach ensures that small enterprises benefit from cutting-edge security technologies while freeing up valuable resources to focus on their core operations.\nIn the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, small businesses can no longer rely on the protections that they’ve relied on in the past. The escalating threat of sophisticated cloud-based attacks demands a proactive and comprehensive approach to security, with cloud detection and response at its core.\nBy embracing CDR, small businesses can fortify their defenses, mitigate risks, and foster a secure environment for growth and innovation. However, the journey towards robust cloud security requires a multifaceted approach, involving partnerships with managed service providers, fostering a security-conscious culture, and continuously adapting to emerging threats.",

    "title": "Honor sfotte Samsung sui pieghevoli con “le scuse più piccole del mondo”",
    "text": "Il team marketing di Honor ha lanciato nelle scorse ore una frecciatina piuttosto ben riuscita a Samsung in tema di pieghevoli. L’iniziativa pubblicitaria mette in risalto l’estrema sottigliezza del\nrecentissimo Magic V3, il cui lancio internazionale è previsto in occasione di IFA 2024 a Berlino, soprattutto se paragonata a quella del Galaxy Z Fold 6, la più recente proposta di Samsung in questo segmento.\nIn concreto, la società ha pubblicato una “lettera di scuse” rivolta agli acquirenti di Galaxy Z Fold incidendola sulla costa, appunto sottilissima, di un’unità di Honor Magic V3. L’idea funziona a molteplici livelli: intanto c’è il messaggio, che più o meno è “pensavate di aver preso un pieghevole super ergonomico, ma guardate qui cos’abbiamo noi”, che punta su un deficit oggettivo e soprattutto di cui\nSamsung è ben al corrente, e poi c’è il fatto di averlo inciso in uno spazio estremamente ridotto. Quest’ultimo aspetto è peraltro un’impresa già di per sé ragguardevole, compiuta dal noto “micro artista” inglese Graham Short.\nShort, che mai cognome fu più azzeccato, ha impiegato circa 90 ore per incidere a mano! il relativamente lungo messaggio di \"scuse\", che conta in totale 166 parole di testo. Short racconta di aver dovuto usare punte di diamante per incidere, a causa dell’elevata durezza del metallo della cerniera del dispositivo. Ogni riga di testo ha più o meno lo stesso spessore di un capello umano, circa 100 micron. Insomma, serve un microscopio per leggere quella che Honor definisce bonariamente “la lettera di scuse più piccola del mondo”.",

    "text": "La UCR frustró el dictamen contra el DNU 656/24, que [otorgó $ 100 mil millones en fondos reservados para la nueva Side](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/milei-firmo-un-dnu-que-otorga-100-mil-millones-a-la-side-como-gastos-reservados/) (Secretaría de Inteligencia). Los dos representantes radicales en la Comisión Bicameral de Trámite Legislativo, el senador Víctor Zimmermann y el diputado Francisco Monti, bloquearon la posibilidad de tratar el decreto este jueves, pero el Gobierno solo consiguió ganar unos días: en la Cámara de Diputados ya trabajan para rechazar la medida en el recinto. Tras un tenso debate, el radicalismo obstruyó junto a La Libertad Avanza y el PRO una moción de Unión por la Patria, acompañada por Nicolás Massot (Encuentro Federal), para incorporar al temario de la reunión el DNU de gastos reservados y el 614/24, que reestructuró el área de inteligencia. La intención de ese sector de la oposición era firmar sendos dictámenes de rechazo. La moción recibió siete votos a favor (seis del kirchnerismo y Massot) y ocho en contra, entre los que figuró, algo incómodo, el jefe del bloque PRO, Luis Juez. La votación podría haber empatado con el correntino Carlos “Camau” Espínola (Unidad Federal), que estuvo ausente, aunque el oficialismo habría definido con el voto en contra del presidente de la comisión, el senador libertario Juan Carlos Pagotto. La victoria de La Libertad Avanza, de todos modos, parece ser efímera: en Diputados, Encuentro Federal (el bloque presidido por Miguel Pichetto y hasta este miércoles llamado Hacemos Coalición Federal) trabaja para convocar a una sesión (posiblemente, el próximo jueves) y rechazar los DNU. Para eso, cuentan con los votos de Unión por la Patria, la Coalición Cívica, el Frente de Izquierda y el sector del radicalismo más reacio a colaborar con el gobierno de Javier Milei. Los decretos pueden ir al recinto sin dictamen porque así lo habilita la Ley 26.122 una vez que se cumplen diez días hábiles desde que ingresan al Congreso y no reciben tratamiento en la bicameral. Ese plazo, en el caso del DNU de fondos reservados, se cumple el próximo jueves. Encuentro Federal pedirá sesión en Diputados para desaprobar el decreto, aunque para anularlo de manera definitiva también se requiere el voto del Senado. En la bicameral, el radicalismo se convirtió en la llave para evitar el tratamiento del tema pese a que, la semana pasada, el bloque de diputados se había pronunciado en contra del DNU. El propio Monti había publicado en redes sociales que “no corresponde la ampliación de fondos (para la Side) ni la condición de reservados”, pero rechazó sumarlo este jueves al temario. “No voy a acompañar la moción del kirchnerismo, pero asumo que va a tomar con seriedad el tema”, argumentó el catamarqueño al reclamarle a Pagotto que cumpla con lo pactado y convoque periódicamente a la comisión para tratar todos los decretos en forma cronológica. En el mismo sentido, Zimmermann pidió “hacer un esfuerzo por tratar los DNU pendientes en tiempo y forma”, incluidos los de inteligencia. “Tenemos que tratar estos dos decretos, ojalá lo hagamos en un tiempo prudencial”, dijo. También pidió conformar “lo antes posible” la Bicameral de Inteligencia, que debe controlar el uso de los fondos reservados. La comisión no se constituye porque el PRO reclama la presidencia (postula al senador misionero Martín Goerling) pero el oficialismo no cede y propone a otro aliado, el entrerriano Edgardo Kueider (Unidad Federal). El kirchnerismo cargó contra Pagotto por haber ignorado una nota presentada el 1ro de agosto en la que solicitaban abordar los dos decretos de inteligencia, que son los únicos que están en plazo de ser tratados por la bicameral. Los 39 que fueron incluidos en la convocatoria ya están en condiciones de ser votados en los recintos y la gran mayoría data de las gestiones de Mauricio Macri y Alberto Fernández. De Milei se incluyeron solo cinco, entre ellos el que dispuso la intervención de la ya disuelta Agencia Federal de Inteligencia (AFI). “Este es un tema muy delicado, muy complejo, que requiere un acuerdo de todas las fuerzas políticas para legislar y no puede ser regulado por DNU”, advirtió la diputada kirchnerista Carolina Gaillard. Y cuestionó la asignación de $ 100 mil millones: “Además de entender que hay otras prioridades, de acuerdo a la Ley de Administración Financiera el monto total del Presupuesto y de los fondos reservados no puede ser modificado por DNU, tiene que ser hecho por ley”. Pagotto emprendió una escueta defensa. “Estamos terminando de poner al día los DNU”, se excusó el riojano, pero Massot lo acusó de incumplir el mandato de realizar reuniones periódicas. “Si hubiesen cumplido los jueves con la moción, ya estaríamos al día hace rato”, le retrucó el diputado. La discusión se cerró con la aprobación de una moción del diputado del PRO Hernán Lombardi (PRO) para realizar reuniones quincenales. Las próximas serán los días 22 de agosto, 5 y 19 de septiembre.",
