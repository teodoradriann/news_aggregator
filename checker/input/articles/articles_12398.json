    "text": "NEW DELHI, Dec 29: President Droupadi Murmu has given her assent to a bill that seeks to put in place a mechanism for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners, according to a Government notification issued today. The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023, has provisions to set up a search committee chaired by the Law Minister and two other persons not below the rank of Secretary, to prepare a panel of five persons for consideration of the selection committee for appointment as CEC or ECs. The bill also has provisions for a Selection Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and a Union Minister, to make recommendations to the President for appointment of CEC and other ECs. The President also granted assent to the Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill, to replace a British-era law governing the publishing industry and simplify the process of registration of periodicals. The Bill replaces the Press and Registration of Books Act of 1867. Rajya Sabha passed the Bill on August 3. “This bill is simple, smart and has a simultaneous process for registration of newspapers and periodicals. Earlier newspapers or magazines had to pass through an eight-step registration process. This can now be done at the click of a button,” Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said responding to the discussion on the bill in the Lok Sabha on December 21. He said newspapers and periodicals will now be able to get registered within two months as against the two to three years required earlier. The President also granted assent to the Central Goods and Services Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 2023, and the Provisional Collection of Taxes Bill, 2023.

Nella finale del doppio misto degli US Open, disputata sull'Arthur Ashe Stadium di New York, hanno sconfitto la coppia americana composta da Taylor Townsend e Donald Young con il punteggio di 7-6, 7-5. Questo risultato li consacra come la prima coppia italiana a vincere un titolo del Grande Slam in questa categoria. Il percorso verso la vittoria non è stato semplice. La partita è stata caratterizzata da momenti di grande tensione e intensità. Nel primo set, gli azzurri hanno dimostrato una notevole capacità di gestione dei momenti cruciali, imponendosi al tie-break con un netto 7-0. Nel secondo set, dopo un equilibrio iniziale, Errani e Vavassori hanno realizzato il break decisivo sul 6-5, chiudendo così l'incontro. Questo trionfo rappresenta un'importante conferma del talento e della determinazione dei due tennisti italiani. Sara Errani, già nota per i suoi successi in singolare e in doppio femminile, ha aggiunto un altro prestigioso titolo al suo palmarès.
