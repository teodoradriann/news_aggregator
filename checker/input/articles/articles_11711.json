    "text": "Finding the best base layer or sailing thermal is the foundation of any layering system. It adds warmth and comfort for minimal bulk.\nWhile some elite athlete sailors may grind winches all day long, the majority of us who sail in weather cool enough to warrant wearing a base layer are static a lot of the time when afloat and will benefit from a thermal insulating layer.\nBest base layer for sailing Helly Hansen HH Lifa Stripe Crew Long Sleeve T-Shirt Helly Hansen brought performance base layers to sailing and Alpine sports with its Lifa range, characterised by the striped sleeves.\nI have used the original Lifa stripe garments for nearly two decades for lightweight insulation while exercising.\nThe 100% polypropylene Lifa construction of the Stripe garments is quick-drying and highly breathable. The synthetic material does pick up odour so this is a wear and wash garment for short periods afloat.\nBuy the Helly Hansen Lifa stripe Long sleeve top from Amazon\nWith each product is a ‘Buy it now’ link. If you click on this then we may receive a small amount of money from the retailer when you purchase the item. This doesn’t affect the amount you pay. Musto Active Base Layer Long-Sleeve Top Having relied on these for nearly a decade, I’ve found not only are they still going strong, but they remain the most comfortable base layers I’ve tried.\nDespite the synthetic mix of polyamide, polypropylene and elastane, they don’t tend to smell badly either – perhaps thanks to an anti-bacterial treatment.\nA variety of knits and weaves, including mesh and honeycomb knits, and a minimum number of seams really help provide comfort – these are base layers you really can live in.\nBuy Musto Active Top from Musto\nZEROFIT Mens Baselayer Zerofit’s Heatrub Ultimate top and leggings are made of a stretchy mix of acrylic, nylon, wool, polyester and polyurethane, with a deep pile of long fibres that traps a thick layer of warm air next to your skin, writes Rupert Holmes.\nAccording to Zerofit, extra heat is generated by friction whenever you move. I used the Ultimate top during six hours on a RIB for the start of the Vendée Globe in November. Despite the damp and wind chill from travelling at speed I stayed impressively warm without needing many additional layers.\nThe high neck also makes a telling difference in cold breeze.\nBuy Zerofit Ultimate top from Amazon\nZhik HydroMerino Zhik has established a reputation with performance sailors for its technical clothing. Its Hydrobase garments blend merino wool with synthetic fibres (polyester, polypropylene and elastane) to create durable, high-performance warmth.\nThe thermals are designed for long periods of activity and were developed with the Dongfeng Race Team during the Volvo Ocean Race.\nI’ve worn these thermals over the last couple of years, especially in the colder winter months, and particularly like the external stitching which helps reduce chafe, and the high-stretch, Lycra-like ankles and cuffs.\nOn the down side they are one of the most expensive choices and the wool content means they can sometimes feel itchy.\nBuy Zhik Hydromarino Top from Zhik\nAlso consider Finisterre Merino Merino and bamboo fibre base layers from the Cornish brand of functional and eco-conscious clothing.\nBuy Finisterre Long sleeve top from Finisterre\nGill Long Sleeve Thermal Nearly half of this synthetic fibre top comprises a performance yarn made from recycled plastic bottles.\nBuy Gill Long Sleeve Thermal from Amazon\nHow to pick the best base layer for sailing Base layers are designed to transfer/wick moisture away from the skin and in some cases to create a layer of insulation and warmth (hence the name thermals). Wicking works by capillary action from the skin to the exterior surface, so to achieve this base layers need to be tight fitting.\nA good long-sleeved base layer and trousers has long been my first garment to pack for cold weather sailing. I also wear these performance base layers for exercise from running to skiing, and through the colder winter months working in my ‘office’ – believe me, days spent in a poorly insulated shed can be as unforgiving as long stints on the rail.\nSailing base layers are typically made from synthetic fibres, such as polyester, which is good for wicking and durability, or polypropylene, known for its hydrophobic and thermal properties.\nNatural fibres such as merino wool and bamboo have also become a popular choice. Merino is naturally insulating and breathable, is soft against the skin and doesn’t pick up odours as quickly as man made materials. However, it is more expensive than polyester and takes longer to dry.\nMost sailing clothing brands now offer both natural and synthetic base layers or a composite of both, so it’s easy to find something that suits you. Cotton should be avoided as a technical layer as it absorbs moisture which then cools and makes you feel cold.\nIf you enjoyed this….

But Amad had other ideas.\nHe forced home the equaliser in the 82nd minute before playing a delightful one-two with Christian Eriksen in the 90th minute to put United ahead. Amad then latched onto a characteristic Saints defensive mishap to clinch the match-ball and transform the night.\nIt was a struggle for much of the evening but the victory lifts United above three London clubs into 12th and builds on that FA Cup win over Arsenal at the weekend. For Ivan Juric and Southampton, it is a desperate blow. They remain 10 points from safety.\nAlejandro Garnacho did miss a big chance to slot United in front early on but that was a rare opening for Amorim's tentative team with Southampton looking the better side in a first half in which only Andre Onana came out with any credit for the home side.\nThe United goalkeeper kept out the lively Kamaldeen Sulemana, who tormented Leny Yoro throughout, before producing a sensational double stop to deny Tyler Dibling and Mateus Fernandes. But Onana was helpless to prevent Ugarte's own goal.\nSouthampton had been the only team not to score a Premier League goal from a corner prior to this game but United's weakness from set-pieces was evident again, a tenth goal conceded from a corner. Sulemana might have doubled Saints' lead after that.\nAnd when substitute Antony contrived to miss an open goal, the mood at Old Trafford turned bleak. Amad, as he has so often this season, changed that. As others shrink, he seems to grow under pressure, always wanting it, offering movement on and off the ball.\nIt was enough to salvage the three points against a Southampton side that crumbled like a team that has won only once all season. Amorim can hardly be satisfied with the overall performance. But for the second time inside a week, he could point to the spirit.",

    "title": "Panvel innovator grows exotic fruits in tropical climate | Mumbai news - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "Navi Mumbai: Cultivating strawberries, red apples, dragon fruits or even for that matter foreign origin water melons or even Japanese rice might seem impossible in the tropical climate of Navi Mumbai but Panvel based scientist Minesh Gadgil claims otherwise. M.Sc graduate and resident of Gulsunde Village, Gadgil for the past 10 years has been demonstrating the scientific and organic way of engaging in unconventional farming.Gadgil calls himself an inventor and has reserved a half acre plot just 15 kilometers away from Panvel city to demonstrate the ways to cultivate these exotic types of fruits and grains. “The general perception is that farming is a loss making venture and I wish to change this notion. Farming when done as per the market demand can be a rewarding experience. With little bit of research and by using proper techniques any form of grains or fruits can be grown successfully and even fetch a good market price,” said the recipient of Krushibhushan 2019.Essentially hailing from a chemical science background, Gagil’s foray into farming happened by chance. To pursue his primary passion of doing research work, the scientist took voluntary retirement from a petrochemical company at the age of 28. “ Post VRS I was researching on deriving bio fuel from the remains of rice husks when the thought of branching into farming happened. I realized that the residue of the husk contained nutrients which could be processed further to develop organic pest preventing solutions. In the process I identified 20 odd variants of leaves which possessed similar nutrients and developed products that enhanced productivity while farming,” said Gadgil, a member of Agriculture Technology and Management Agency (ATMA) Raigad District.In addition to exotic fruits the scientist has experimented in cultivating grains like Telegana Sona Rice known for its low glycemic index , red rice and even black rice. Presently the half acre plot is awaiting the yields from 100 odds seeds of African origin watermelons sown in October. “ I keep experimenting with different types of seeds and grains. In October I procured seed of African origin water melons and some of these have borne fruits which are yellow in color unlike the commonly found green melons. Additionally the saplings of blue and black berries planted earliest are expected to yield fruits at the earliest,” said gadgil.The scientist takes immense pride in recalling successfully cultivating almost 30 grams weighing strawberries last year. “ The mindset needs to change with regard to restricting only traditional farming practices. I have showcased my successes in various government programs and even impart my understanding with farming communities,” he adds.",
