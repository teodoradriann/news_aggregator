    "title": "From stray shots to running hot: Brisbane Lions forward Charlie Cameron has a smile after Jekyll and Hyde season",
    "text": "CHARLIE Cameron is heading to a place he belongs on Saturday night – a final at the Gabba – but the road to get there in 2024 has been vastly different to the one of years past. Cameron has been a lightning rod for Brisbane's success since he headed north from Adelaide at the end of 2017, integral in taking it to six straight finals appearances with his electric play inside 50 and an infectious nature that endears him to teammates and supporters alike. Just less than 12 months ago Cameron looked like being a Grand Final hero, beating Brayden Maynard and Isaac Quaynor to a loose ball and putting the Lions in front with five minutes remaining. But alas for him and his team, Collingwood fought back to snatch the premiership in one of the most memorable deciders this century. Since that moment, it's been anything but smooth-sailing for Cameron as he's overcome a spate of off-season surgeries, an unlikely crisis of confidence around goals and a new-look forward line that has unearthed his inner leader. The rollercoaster really began halfway through 2023 when a head clash with Richmond's three-time premiership skipper Trent Cotchin knocked out Cameron's front teeth. One aspect of the lively small forward's career that is often overlooked is his resilience. Not only did he return to the Gabba that night and kick two goals in a huge win, he played the next week, the week after and the remainder of the season with false teeth in place of the missing ones. Remarkably, when Cameron runs out against Carlton on Saturday night it will be his 142nd consecutive match, taking him in the top 20 for all-time player streaks in VFL/AFL history. Fixing the teeth long-term was an ordeal though. He required six surgeries between the end of last season and the beginning of this one. Unlike the previous five years, which have been relatively uninterrupted for Cameron during pre-season, this was different, regularly missing sessions for surgery and then handled a little more cautiously on return. \"I've got six new teeth thanks to Cotchin,\" Cameron laughed as he sat down to discuss 2024 in the café adjoining Brisbane's training base at Brighton Homes Arena. \"He's working here at the moment (in a leadership advisory role) and I remind him every day about it. \"This pre-season … it was an obstacle, but you adapt and overcome it. \"You miss a few sessions here and there, but I thought I had a decent pre-season still. \"It was a good lesson for myself because the last few years I haven't had those challenges and obstacles.\" In Brisbane's first pre-season hitout against Gold Coast, Cameron had four goals shortly after quarter-time, using his nous more than anything to teach unproven Bodhi Uwland a few valuable lessons. By the time Opening Round against Carlton rolled around, Cameron thought he was in a good spot, but it was then that another unexpected obstacle would jump up. The Mornington Island-raised product has not been automatic around goal over his career, but as close as you could expect from someone that takes shots from all sorts of angles and under all sorts of pressure. Cameron had topped 50 goals in four of his previous five seasons. He kicked 57 in 2019, 55 in 2021, 54 in 2022 and 59 last year. The only glitch in that streak was his 31 goals in the COVID-impacted 2020 season. If you extrapolate that output to a regular season length with regular game durations, he would have been right around 50 again. In every season at Brisbane, Cameron's accuracy for all shots at goal – including ones that miss everything – has always been over 50 per cent. Which brings us back to the Blues at the Gabba. With the Lions leading by 45 points midway through the second quarter, Cameron took a mark 20m from goal, just off centre, and on the good side for his right foot snap. It's a shot he could likely do with his eyes closed, but on this occasion, he curled it a little too much. Behind. That 46-point lead would evaporate, and Carlton would famously win. It would start a string of unusual misses for Cameron over the early stages of the year. Simple set shots were going astray, left foot snaps from straight in front were sailing wide, there was indecision in how to set up for kicks at goal. It was an unusual sight after being so prolific and efficient for so long. \"The Carlton game, I had that shot from right in front and I missed, and it knocked the confidence a little bit,\" he said. \"Then when I was in front of goal (next time) I was thinking about missing and not thinking about the process. \"When you're getting opportunities and missing ones you'd normally kick, your confidence does get knocked, but you've got to try and block it out. \"You do a lot of work out here on the training ground and it's not showing up in games, which is frustrating. \"Murray (forward line coach Murray Davis) told me to think like a goldfish. If you make a mistake, just move on and forget about it. \"At the start of the season I was in my own head.\" To help overcome his struggles, Cameron came up with a cue, a simple word he wrote on his wrist prior to each game. Smile. \"I'm playing a game I love and enjoy, so I might as well smile and have fun out there and engage with everyone and bring energy. \"It's a small thing, but it's helped me.\" Although not at his All-Australian level of last year (he also earned a jacket in 2019), Cameron has steadily improved in the second half of the season. Although his finishing statistics are below his usual high standards, the 46.8 per cent conversion rate has been on the rise since the mid-season bye. Crucial goals from difficult angles late in matches against Sydney and Collingwood have shown his flare for the key moment is still there, while the renowned forward pressure has also risen a cog. The new element of Cameron's game he's had to develop though is his leadership. With Lincoln McCarthy and Darcy Gardiner both suffering season-ending knee injuries in round eight, Zac Bailey missing five weeks with an ankle problem and Eric Hipwood also missing the odd game, Brisbane's forward line took on a new look. Kai Lohmann has become a regular, as has Logan Morris. Suddenly, the guidance from 30-year-old Cameron became more important. \"I had Eddie Betts in my first couple of years, he helped me out a lot. He's one of the best small forward of all time, so to learn off him was key. \"With Kai, I'm just trying to set him up, let him play on instinct and help him out when he needs it. \"He's a confidence player like myself. He's an exciting young player. He has his moments where he does a bit too much, but we all say to him, if you make a mistake, move on and we'll move on during the week. \"Kai's had some big moments this year. He's played his role and he's an exciting young player.\" Lohmann (27 goals) and Morris (18 goals) have more than pulled their weight in a team that has been the fifth highest scoring of the season. The dental surgeries, wayward radar, questions of confidence and extra leadership has been a different path for Cameron, but it's led to the same place – back to the finals. His record in the competition's biggest matches is one of the greatest ever among small forwards. Whether it's Adam Saad or Nic Newman that lines up alongside him on Saturday night, they'll know they're manning one of the most dangerous players inside 50 in the modern game. Cameron's 40 goals from 19 finals appearances is only bettered by Tom Hawkins (56) in terms of goals among current players. It's more than Jack Gunston, Jeremy Cameron, Dustin Martin and Toby Greene – and at a better goals-a-game average than the latter trio. \"It's all about the moments in games and taking those opportunities,\" Cameron said. \"As a small forward you don't get opportunities too often. Finals is exactly like that, taking your moment when it comes around. \"The real season starts now. We're excited and we're looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. \"We had a taste last year with the Grand Final … you do want to get back there and feel that excitement. \"I've played in two Grand Finals. You want that opportunity again. The opportunity is there, it's just a matter of taking it.\"",

    "text": "More tax benefits for health insurance under the new tax regime, relaxation in payment norms for MSMEs and incentives for the agri-tech sector are among the expectations of stakeholders from the first budget of the Modi 3.0 government .\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the full Budget for fiscal 2024-25 on July 23, which will be the first major policy document of the new government.\nClick here for more 2024-25 Budget related updates\nAnup Rau, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Future Generali India Insurance Company, said the deduction limit on health insurance premiums under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act has remained unchanged for the past nine years despite the fact that there has been a significant rise in healthcare costs across the country.\n\"It would be best if the limit for medical insurance is linked to inflation and gets revised automatically every year or once in a couple of years. Also, the benefits need to be extended to the New Tax regime since increasing health insurance penetration is critical. So, we hope the upcoming Budget to announce some hike in the deduction limit on health insurance premiums,\" Rau said.\nTapan Singhel, MD & CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said reforms like offering health insurance to employees at negotiated rates, reducing GST on health insurance premiums, and offering tax benefits like increased Section 80D exemption limits would make health insurance more affordable and accessible, especially for the 'missing middle' segment of our population.\n\"Additionally, for senior citizens, removing the limit on deductions for health insurance premiums would significantly ease their financial burden,\" Mr. Singhel said.\nThe Finance Minister is likely to lay out the government's economic agenda in the budget.\nOn expectations from the Ms. Sitharaman's budget, D S Negi, CEO of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC), said the focus on reforming cancer care in India is crucial and it is important to prioritise funding for advanced treatments like immunotherapy and personalised medicine, ensuring more patients can access these cutting-edge therapies.\n\"Extending Ayushman Bharat to those aged above 70 years will be highly beneficial for senior citizens. However, the current coverage limit of ₹5 lakh may not be sufficient for critical illnesses such as cancer, where treatment costs can range from ₹15-20 lakh.\n\"Therefore, it is essential to consider increasing the coverage limit for critical illnesses like cancer to ensure adequate financial support for cancer patients,\" Mr. Negi added.\nThe budget is likely to include steps to fast-rack reforms to make India a USD 5-trillion economy in the near future and turn the country into a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.\nAhead of the budget, Chairman of the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI) Pavan Choudary said that customs duties and taxes levied on medical devices in India are one of the highest in the world which directly impacts patient affordability.\n\"On the other hand, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Italy, and Norway impose no such duties. Australia and Japan levy only a minimal 0.5 per cent duty, while in the United States, it stands at 2 per cent, and in China at 3 per cent.\n\"This stark contrast creates risk for illegal imports of medical devices in India that are not backed by legal and service guarantees. Furthermore, such trade would undercut the Indian government's tariff revenue,\" he said.\nVivek Jalan, Partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, said as per recommendations of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Section 43B(h) in the Income Tax Act was introduced from AY 24-25. However, the alignment of the disallowance for payables under sections 43B(h) of the Act has been made with the MSME Act, which requires that payment has to be made to an SME within a maximum of 45 days.\n\"This is difficult in the present-day trade where a 60-90 days credit period is the norm.\n\"In this budget, it is expected that this provision will be relaxed/amended aligning the same with the CGST Act w.r.t. disallowance when payment to SMEs is not made within 180 days. Hence, in case a taxpayer does not pay an SME within 180 days, then the expense may be added back to his income,\" he said.\nIn anticipation of the budget, Saurabh Rai, CEO of Arahas, has expressed high expectations for substantial investments in sustainability and geospatial technology.\n\"We anticipate significant allocations towards renewable energy projects and incentives for companies embracing green technologies,\" he said.\nAdditionally, Rai said that boosting agri-tech innovations, providing tax incentives for tech companies and investing in human capital development is imperative for driving sustainable growth.\nSanjay Kumar, Founder and CEO of Geospatial World, said that to fully leverage the power of digital twin technology, it is crucial to allocate dedicated funds to it in the Union Budget.\n\"This allocation will facilitate the widespread adoption of digital twins, driving efficiency gains, cost savings, and improved decision-making in infrastructure projects. By investing in this technology, India can achieve significant long-term benefits, such as enhanced asset management, reduced downtime, and increased resilience to environmental challenges,\" Mr. Kumar said.\nMs. Sitharaman was given charge of the finance portfolio in the second stint of the Modi government after the 2019 general elections, becoming the first full-time woman Finance Minister in independent India.\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "Can a 5 oz Bird Really Carry a 1 lb Coconut? Unraveling the Monty Python Paradox The short answer is a resounding no . A bird weighing a mere 5 ounces is physically incapable of carrying a 1-pound coconut (16 ounces). The weight disparity is far too significant. While the iconic scene from Monty Python’s “Holy Grail” is hilarious, it’s firmly rooted in comedic absurdity, not avian biology. The reality of bird flight and weight-lifting capacity makes the scenario impossible.\nUnderstanding the Limits of Avian Flight Birds are marvels of evolutionary engineering, exquisitely adapted for flight. This adaptation prioritizes lightness and aerodynamic efficiency . Every gram counts, influencing factors such as wing surface area, muscle strength, and overall skeletal structure.\nWeight Ratios and Flight Dynamics The ability of a bird to carry a load is primarily determined by its power-to-weight ratio . This ratio describes the amount of power a bird can generate relative to its body weight. A higher power-to-weight ratio allows a bird to lift heavier objects. However, even the strongest birds have limitations.\nConsider that many birds struggle to even lift their own weight. Therefore, lifting something more than three times their body weight is impossible.\nThe Case of the European Swallow and the Coconut The Monty Python sketch specifically references the European swallow. Research from the Avian Demography Unit of the University of Capetown indicates that the average adult European swallow has a body mass of approximately 20.3 grams (0.72 ounces). Even if the bird were exceptionally strong for its species, the physics simply don’t support it carrying a 1-pound coconut.\nBeyond Monty Python: Exploring Bird Lifting Capabilities While a 5-ounce bird can’t manage a 1-pound coconut, the question raises broader inquiries about bird lifting capacity. Several factors influence what birds can carry:\nSpecies: Larger, more powerful birds, such as eagles, hawks, and owls, can carry significantly heavier loads than smaller birds like swallows or hummingbirds. Wing Size and Shape: Birds with larger wings and a more suitable airfoil can generate more lift. Muscle Strength: The strength of the flight muscles is crucial for both lift and propulsion. Flight Style: Birds that soar and glide (e.g., vultures) can carry heavier loads with less energy expenditure than those that rely on continuous flapping. Examples of Bird Lifting Prowess Certain bird species do showcase impressive lifting capabilities, usually for the transport of food.\nEagles: Golden eagles, for instance, can carry prey weighing several pounds, occasionally approaching or even exceeding their own weight. Ospreys: These birds are known for carrying large fish, often weighing a significant portion of their own body weight. Seabirds: Some seabirds, such as gulls, can carry relatively large shellfish or other food items back to their nests. However, even these strong fliers have limitations. None can remotely approach lifting something weighing three times more than themselves.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are 15 frequently asked questions related to bird flight, weight, and the infamous coconut paradox:\nWhat is the average weight of a European swallow? The average adult European swallow weighs around 20.3 grams (0.72 ounces). How much does a typical coconut weigh? A full-sized coconut typically weighs around 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds 1 ounce), or 48 oz. What is the fastest flying bird? The peregrine falcon can reach speeds exceeding 320 km/h (200 mph) in dives. In level flight, the white-throated needletail can reach up to 169 km/h (105 mph). How far can a swallow fly in a day? Swallows can fly up to 200 miles a day during migration. Can birds sleep while flying? Some birds, particularly those that migrate long distances, are thought to be able to enter a state of unihemispheric sleep, where one half of the brain rests while the other remains alert. Are swallows aggressive birds? Swallows can become territorial around their nests and may “divebomb” to protect their young, but they are generally not as aggressive as other birds. What does a barn swallow look like? Barn Swallows have a steely blue back, wings, and tail, with rufous to tawny underparts, and a deeply forked tail. How fast do swallows beat their wings? Swallows beat their wings at a rate of approximately 7-9 beats per second. Is it okay to feed birds coconut? Yes, fresh coconut is a good treat for birds. Avoid desiccated (dried) coconut, as it can swell in the bird’s stomach. How do you prepare coconut for birds? You can offer fresh coconut halves. Also, you can fill a coconut shell with melted lard, seeds, raisins, and mealworms. How many miles does a swallow tattoo represent in naval tradition? Each swallow tattoo represents 5,000 nautical miles in a sailor’s career. Can two swallows carry a coconut if they work together? Even with a makeshift litter, the weight disparity would likely prevent even a team of swallows from transporting a coconut over any significant distance. What factors determine a bird’s lifting capacity? Species, wing size and shape, muscle strength, and flight style all influence a bird’s ability to carry weight. What are some examples of birds that can carry heavy loads? Eagles, ospreys, and some seabirds are capable of carrying relatively heavy loads, typically prey items. Where can I find reliable information about environmental topics? The Environmental Literacy Council, found at enviroliteracy.org, provides excellent resources on a wide range of environmental topics. **What is the **power-to-weight ratio ? This is the ratio of how much power a bird can generate relative to its body weight. A higher power-to-weight ratio allows a bird to lift heavier objects. Conclusion While the image of a European swallow carrying a coconut is undeniably humorous, it clashes with the laws of physics and avian biology. Birds are marvelously adapted for flight, but their lifting capacity is limited by weight ratios, wing structure, and muscle power. The Environmental Literacy Council promotes science-based information and helps inform the public about such topics. The next time you enjoy the Monty Python sketch, remember that it’s a delightful flight of fancy rather than a realistic depiction of a bird’s capabilities.",

    "text": "It was the highest-income year in the history of Burghausen tourism, reports managing director Sigrid Resch. 110,000 overnight stays, more than 30,000 guests on around 1,600 guided tours, more than half a million visitors to the castle and 231 boat trips on the Salzach: all record values ​​in 2023 that Burghauser tourism can look back on.\nThe tourist attraction is undoubtedly the world’s longest castle. But more and more people not only want to take a walk around the castle, but also learn about history. “The demand for our guest tours is enormous, the tours in historical clothing are particularly popular. But the numerous themed tours and, last year in particular, the culinary tours are also highlights for our guests,” says Resch.\nShortage of tour guides The demand is so high that the tour guides are now reaching their capacity limits. “We hope that more guides can be trained this year so that we can continue to meet demand in the future,” says the managing director.\nThe tourism experts are particularly pleased that Burghausen is not only popular for short and day trips, but that the average length of stay has increased to more than two days. The mobile home parking space is also popular; around 3,000 mobile homes stopped in Burghausen last year. The cross-border discovery district also posted record values, the OÖN reported. Among other things, because there are many cycle tourists in the region – and they also often head to Burghausen as a destination.\n2024 is already promising The new year is also off to a promising start, as Sigrid Resch explains. Up to 2,000 visitors come to the castle on the weekends, the booking situation is already good, although the official season only started with the start of the International Jazz Week (March 12th to 17th).\nePaper\nRead the ePaper now!\nRead the daily ePaper edition of the OÖNachrichten – browse through it digitally now!\nto the e-paper\ninfo By clicking on the icon you can add the keyword to your topics.\ninfo\nBy clicking on the icon you open your “my topics” page.

    "text": "Gigantesco árbol caído en la Alameda provoca interrupción total del tránsito hacia el oriente El Ministerio de Transporte informó de la situación en la comuna de Santiago, la cual no provocó lesionados. Durante la mañana de este viernes, un gigantesco árbol cayó en la Alameda, obstruyendo las tres pistas hacia el oriente en la comuna de Santiago, región Metropolitana. Este evento fue provocado por [las intensas lluvias y fuertes ráfagas de viento](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/08/02/sistema-frontal-una-persona-muere-por-caida-de-palmera-en-estacion-central-tras-fuertes-rafagas-de-viento-en-la-region-metropolitana/) que alcanzaron los 120 km/h. Revisa también: En concreto, según lo reportado por el Ministerio de Transporte, poco antes de las 7.00 de la madrugada, un árbol cayó en la intersección de la calle Almirante Latorre con la Avenida Libertador Bernardo O’Higgins, frente al colegio Sagrados Corazones. Hasta el lugar se ha movilizado personal especializado para la remoción del árbol, que por sus características debe ser quitado por equipos profesionales. Ante esto, los automovilistas en la zona están desviándose por calle Brasil hacia el norte para luego tomar rutas aledañas y continuar en dirección al oriente. No se registraron personas heridas y usuarios en redes sociales reportan que, al cierre de esta nota, la situación continúa de la misma forma.
