    "title": "Wollongong City Council assures its mulch is asbestos-free",
    "text": "Wollongong City Council produces most of the mulch it uses in parks, allowing it to be sure the material is free of asbestos, the council said. Sydney's growing crisis of parks and gardens affected by asbestos contamination this week prompted the launch of asbestos taskforce, with the problems so far understood to involve a single supplier of mulch. With schools, hospitals and public parks among hundreds of sites in Sydney suspected to be contaminated, Wollongong deputy mayor Tania Brown said she had written to the council's general manager asking for assurances about potential contamination in this city. She didn't have to wait long before the [assurances](https://wollongong.nsw.gov.au/council/news/articles/february-2024/statement-to-our-community-mulch-in-parks) came. \"I want to be able to assure our community that the mulch used in our local parks and playgrounds is safe and contaminant free,\" Cr Brown said. \"I have written to the general manager of Wollongong City Council seeking confirmation that the supply of mulch used by Wollongong City Council is safe and that we can verify where the mulch has been sourced.\" The council's response came just hours after Cr Brown put out a media release titled \"Are our playgrounds safe?\" The council said its practice was to generate its own mulch for the majority of projects. \"We wish to assure our community that Wollongong City Council self-generates the majority of mulch that is used across our parks and open spaces,\" a council statement said. \"This means we know where our mulch is sourced, how it is processed and ensures it's used in accordance with the NSW EPA Mulch Order 2016. \"We're able to document the use of the mulch through council's waste classification process. \"This practice also allows us to sustainably reuse and repurpose materials collected from our natural areas projects and local tree loppers. \"From time-to-time, some projects do require us to purchase additional mulch from an external supplier. We have not purchased any materials from the supplier associated with the EPA's investigation.\" Cr Brown herself helped launch the council/'s Food Organics, Garden Organics program, where kitchen waste is included with other garden materials in \"green waste\" bins. This is then processed at Kembla Grange company Soilco, and mulch is available for sale to the public at the nearby Whytes Gully tip. Wollongong has had its share of asbestos problems, including the Helensburgh off-road cycling track which remains closed after asbestos was found to be present in fill across the site. And this week Port Kembla company South Coast Equipment [was ordered](https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/8522927/asbestos-contamination-in-illawarra-adds-to-sydneys-problems/) by the Environment Protection Authority not to store asbestos waste on-site after testing late last year revealed it was present in a stockpile of \"fines\" which may have been destined for use as construction fill.

    "title": "‘Twice witness to Nakba’: Gaza grandmother's story of survival and death in 1948 and 2024 | Middle East Eye",
    "text": "Halima Abu Dayya thought she lived the worst day of her life when Zionist militias expelled her from her home during their ethnic cleansing campaign of\nPalestinein 1948, known to Palestinians as theNakba.But that day turned out to be merely a glimpse of the hardships she endured during the ongoing\nIsraelicampaign of bombardment, starvation and forced displacement in Gaza. Hardships that eventually led to her death in Gaza City, according to her family.Middle East Eye spoke to the grandmother, a resident of Gaza City,\nin 2018, when she was 91. Then, she recalled her forced displacement from her home in Dayr Sunayd, a village in the Gaza subdistrict, as Zionist massacres and destruction of Palestinian towns paved the way for the creation of the state of Israel.“We were forced at gunpoint to get in cars that drove us to a place near the borders with Gaza, where we stayed for three days, and then were moved again to the Gaza Strip,” Abu Dayya told MEE at the time.\n“I had three children and was pregnant when we were displaced. It was the hardest day of my entire life.”\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nAs the ongoing, year-long Israeli\nwar on Gazaescalated, MEE contacted Abu Dayya’s family for another interview.The family said Abu Dayya was displaced over 10 times in nearly seven months. They struggled to provide her with food during the Israeli-triggered famine in northern Gaza earlier this year, as she couldn’t eat the bread made from animal fodder - the only food available at the time.\nAnd ultimately, she passed away.\nHaunting fear of leaving\nAfnan Abu al-Qumsan, Abu Dayya’s granddaughter, accompanied her during her multiple displacements. She recalled her grandmother's final days as being filled with confusion: as her Alzheimer’s kept getting worse, Abu Dayya began to think her son was her father.\n“She was constantly asking about her home town and the orchard [owned by her family before the Nakba],” Qumsan told MEE.\n'Almost every morning, she asked to return home... Every house we entered confused her'- Afnan Abu al-Qumsan, Abu Dayya’s granddaughter\nThe first displacement was to a neighbour's home, Qumsan added, after their area, al-Tawam in northwestern Gaza City, was carpet-bombed by Israeli fighter jets.\n“We took refuge with our neighbours in their basement and reached out to the Red Cross, but they could only make it [to our area],” the 29-year-old said.\n“It was difficult for us to move, especially with the fire belts, which didn’t stop. Even an ambulance that came for one of our neighbours was bombed as soon as it reached them.”\nAbu Dayya and her family moved multiple times between different neighbourhoods in Gaza City in the following months, adjusting to the incursions of Israeli troops.\nWhile hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to move to the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip following Israeli ejection orders, Abu Dayya’s family preferred to stay in the north, fearing a repeat of the Nakba.\nThe Nakba, or \"catastrophe\" as it is known in English, refers to the ethnic cleansing of some 750,000 Palestinians from their lands and homes in historic Palestine to make way for the creation of Israel in 1948.\nQumsan said that her grandmother still carried a haunting fear of leaving her home behind, just as she did 76 years earlier.\n“She would constantly ask why we left the house, demanding to be taken back and asking about her belongings and clothes. Almost every morning, she asked to return home,” Qumsan told MEE.\n“Every house we entered confused her, and she kept asking where she was, pleading to go back.”\nIn 1948, Abu Dayya was pregnant with Qumsan’s father, moving from one area to another while carrying him in her womb. During this current war, her 76-year-old son reversed the roles, carrying his elderly mother during the multiple displacements.\n“Grandma couldn’t walk, so she needed a wheelchair, and someone had to carry her. My dad carried her with the help of my 12- and 14-year-old nephews,” Qumsan said.\n“One time, on 29 March, we left the al-Shifa Hospital area in the early morning of Ramadan while fasting, having gone days without sleep, food, or clean water. There was a tank in the street.\n\"We left with our neighbours, but we were the last to move because we had to carry Grandma, and it was hard to push the wheelchair. They fired shells towards us after we crossed the intersection, but God spared us. The streets were filled with rubble, and her feet were injured.”\nAn ‘even worse’ Nakba\nAbu Dayya lived through two major displacements - the Nakba and the current war on Gaza - and her granddaughter says this one “might be even worse” than 1948.\n“She was twice witness to the Nakba. In 1948, she was displaced once from Deir Sunayd to Gaza. But during this war, she was displaced about 10 times. At her old age and with her inability to walk, the displacement was a thousand times harder for her.\n“Every time we fled, the devastation and shelling left her in shock and tears. Sometimes, she saw martyrs lying in the streets.”\nThe scenes triggered painful memories for Abu Dayya, which her children and grandchildren had heard many times before.\nDuring the Nakba, the shelling was heard everywhere, she would tell them.\nThe terror was also at its peak, especially after the news of the\nDeir Yassin massacrespread.The massacre was committed on 9 April 1948 by Zionist militiamen who went house to house, killing more than 100 people in the small Palestinian village near Jerusalem, despite having agreed to an earlier truce. Many of those killed were women, children and the elderly.\n“During that time, they heard that pregnant women in Deir Yassin were being killed or forced to miscarry,” Qumsan said.\n“I think this only increased her fear, of being pregnant and having children with her. They were forced out at gunpoint, under bombardment, to Gaza.\"\n'There was a time when we only had bread made from animal fodder, which she couldn’t eat. Both she and my father became weaker from their age'– Afnan Abu al-Qumsan\nToday, nearly two million Palestinians are internally displaced in Gaza.\nAbu Dayya told her grandchildren that when she left her home in Deir Sunayd, she thought that she would return in a few days.\n“[We] dug a pit and put our clothes in it, thinking we would return. We didn’t,” Abu Dayya said in a video recorded by her grandchildren and seen by MEE.\nFor months, Israel’s military has prevented or severely restricted the entry of essential, life-saving food into the northern parts of the Gaza Strip, ultimately causing widespread famine that claimed the lives of many Palestinians, particularly children and the elderly.\nLike most elderly people in Gaza, Abu Dayya’s health deteriorated rapidly during that period.\n“In her last days, she stayed with us at my sister's house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood. Her health began to deteriorate, especially with the lack of basic necessities like fruits, vegetables, milk, or yoghurt,\" Qumsan recalled.\nThere was a time when we only had bread made from animal fodder, which she couldn’t eat. Both she and my father became weaker from their age and the continuous displacement without proper transportation.”\nReturning to Haifa\nAbu Dayya died on Sunday 26 May.\nInitially, the family were going to bury her in a stadium-turned-mass grave for people killed in the current war, due to the danger of reaching the Sheikh Radwan Cemetery.\nBut the family took the risk and made their way to the cemetery, burying her next to her husband, Mahmoud Moussa Abu al-Qumsan.\nAt the time of her death, Abu Dayya was separated from most of her family, as some of her daughters and one of her sisters had fled to southern Gaza, while most of her sons were abroad.\n“After her death, we returned to [our neighbourhood] al-Tawam. A large part of the house was destroyed, and the area was almost deserted. Most people had gone south, or their homes were completely wiped out,” Abu al-Qumsan recalled.\nShe spoke of how, despite the family's constant efforts to comfort her grandmother and help her move past the traumatic memories of the Nakba, the conditions she endured during the war kept triggering her.\n“She couldn’t sleep at night, waking up startled by the sound of bombings. Whenever there was shelling during our displacement, she became terrified of the sound and the destruction, saying, ‘The [Israelis] are going to bomb us,'” she explained.\n“Before the war, Grandma loved the series 'Returning to Haifa', based on\nGhassan Kanafani's novel about the Nakba. She used to watch it with me on the phone and would always ask about Safiya [a Palestinian refugee], and whether she found her lost son.“She would cry for them as if they were her own family.”\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

    "text": "El sábado será exhibida por primera vez en público una antigua “cabeza romana” hallada en las inmediaciones de una [casa señorial británica](https://www.clarin.com/viajes/inglaterra-escocia-castillos-visitar-alojarse-realeza_0_n5RTK82ICN.html). El tesoro fue descubierto a finales de 2023 por Greg Crawley, un conductor de excavadoras que trabajaba en el estacionamiento de la mansión cuando lo halló. “Fue una verdadera sorpresa cuando el cubo de la excavadora pasó sobre lo que pensé que era una piedra grande para revelar una cara. Cuando lo recogí me di cuenta de que era la cabeza de una estatua”, dijo Greg al sitio oficial de Burghley. Y añadió: “No lo podía creer cuando me dijeron que era una estatua romana de mármol. Fue una sensación increíble haber encontrado algo tan antiguo y especial; definitivamente, mi mejor descubrimiento”. La cabeza de mármol La cabeza de mármol es la de una dama romana y data del siglo I o II d.C, según los especialistas. Además, dos semanas más tarde también encontraron cerca del lugar en donde estaba enterrada la cabeza el busto de la estatua. Para exhibir ambas piezas se les añadió una clavija de hierro que permite mantenerlas erguidas. Se cree que la cabeza llegó desde [Italia](https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/italia-destino-elegido-van-pais-ciudades-van_0_9LYAUUY0GE.html) aproximadamente en 1760 y, si bien afirman que la ingresó al país el “noveno conde”, aún se desconoce cómo llegó específicamente al patio de Burghley. Las teorías son de lo más alocadas: van desde un robo fallido hasta un descarte con entierro incluido. La exhibición La cabeza y el torso serán exhibidos dentro de la Escalera del Infierno de Burghley el próximo 16 de marzo en la apertura de la temporada 2024. La antigüedad estará acompañada de una explicación sobre su descubrimiento. Según describe el sitio de Burghley, la casa señorial en donde se encontraban las piezas \"es una de las más grandes y majestuosas que se conservan del siglo XVI y un maravilloso ejemplo de las grandes casas prodigio isabelinas construidas en honor a la Reina\". William Cecil, Lord Alto Tesorero de la Reina Isabel I, la concibió y construyó entre 1555 y 1587. \"Burghley es un testimonio de la ambición y la visión del cortesano más poderoso de la primera época isabelina\", se lee en el portal del lugar.

    "title": "A bittersweet goodbye: Spokane Police Chief Craig Meidl reflects on his time leading department - Fri, 29 Dec 2023 PST",
    "text": "A bittersweet goodbye: Spokane Police Chief Craig Meidl reflects on his time leading department The six weeks since Spokane Police Chief Craig Meidl announced his resignation have been bittersweet. The hundreds of messages and dozens of honors have been “beyond my wildest imaginations,” Meidl said Friday, his last day. But he said giving up the career he has dreamed of since being a little boy has been tough. Meidl has said he intended to step down soon regardless of who won the mayoral race, but he believes his views on policing wouldn’t mesh with incoming Mayor Lisa Brown’s. Meidl was born in California then moved around quite a bit, ending up in Seattle. “All of those states that I lived in, all those places that I lived in, all of it,” Meidl said. “I wanted to be a police officer.” He came to the Spokane Police Department in January 1994 and never left, rising through the ranks until he became chief seven years ago. “It has just been a tremendous honor,” Meidl said of leading the department, especially over the past few challenging years with nationwide calls for police reform and the COVID-19 pandemic. Meidl’s leadership through difficult times was recognized when Assistant Police Chief Justin Lundgren presented Meidl with the Distinguished Service Medal this week. “During his tenure as Chief, the state and nation experienced significant and sustained challenges making his time at the helm one of the most challenging periods in modern law enforcement history,” Lundgren wrote in his nomination. Lundgren noted Meidl served as president of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, and was recognized statewide for his leadership. The Distinguished Service Medal was just one of a slew of awards presented to Meidl over the past six weeks, said Julie Humphreys, department spokesperson. Those awards included recognition from the local contingent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, Frontier Behavioral Health, U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and outgoing Mayor Nadine Woodward. “The depth of support and appreciation that I have heard from the community members was something that I never fathomed,” Meidl said, before noting all his accomplishments are really due to his team. “My entire team deserves that level of support, because you cannot do this job by yourself,” Meidl said. One of the best parts of the job, Meidl said, has been connecting with so many facets of the community in such a unique way. “I want this community to know honestly how amazing they are,” he said. Meidl hopes the Spokane community knows their support is a huge reason many people apply to work for the Spokane Police Department. “We do have an amazing department of men and women. We hire humans, so we have to acknowledge they make mistakes and do things we’d prefer they not do,” Meidl said. “But overwhelmingly, every employee comes in every day and does the best for their community, and that is not going to change no matter who the chief is.” As for Meidl, he still hasn’t solidified his plans but is excited for the next chapter. He recently went to Montana to watch his son, Matthew Meidl, 23, graduate from the Montana Highway Patrol academy. It was a bit of a passing of the torch, he said. “He has such a good heart, and he is doing such a good job as well,” Meidl said. Lundgren was selected by incoming Brown to take over the department as acting chief.",

    "title": "Fedeli arrivano in ritardo alla messa, il parroco nega loro la comunione: è polemica - ilGiornale.it",
    "text": "Il parroco avrebbe negato la comunione ad alcuni fedeli, nel corso della messa. Il motivo? Le persone in questione sarebbero entrate in chiesa a funzione liturgica già iniziata. Per una scelta che i diretti interessati non avrebbero a quanto pare gradito, e della quale avrebbero già provveduto ad avvertire il vescovo. La messa della vigilia di Natale sembra insomma aver già dato origine a polemiche, ad Arezzo. Se non altro stando a quel che riporta la testata online ArezzoNotizie a proposito della vicenda in oggetto, con tanto di testimonianza di una fedele alla quale sarebbe stata negata la comunione proprio per essere arrivata a messa iniziata. L'episodio in questione risalirebbe a stamani e sarebbe avvenuto nel capoluogo aretino, nella chiesa di Sant'Egidio di via dell'Orciolaia. Sulla base di quanto ricostruito, diversi parrocchiani sarebbero arrivati nei minuti successivi all'inizio della funzione liturgica.\nUn ritardo che il nuovo parroco non avrebbe a quanto pare gradito particolarmente. E lo avrebbe oltretutto fatto presente, in qualche modo, già durante il sermone. \"Quando sono entrata, già ho notato un clima strano. La liturgia era iniziata da poco, ho ascoltato il Vangelo, ma non è stata fatta l'omelia - ha raccontato la fedele al sito - il parroco ha pronunciato qualche parola di polemica, che ho appena colto. Intorno i presenti hanno rumoreggiato. Ma il fatto più grave è accaduto al momento dell'eucaristia. Tutti si sono messi in fila, io ero l'ultima. Ma molti si lamentavano, c'era chi tornava via chiedendosi che prete fosse\". Il parroco, sempre secondo quanto raccontato dalla donna, avrebbe insomma operato una sorta di selezione fra i parrocchiani in fila durante l'eucaristia. Avrebbe in buona sostanza consentito di ricevere la comunione solo ai fedeli arrivati in chiesa in orario e che hanno quindi seguito l'intera funzione, negandola agli altri.\nPer i \"ritardatari\" non ci sarebbe insomma stato niente da fare. \"Il parroco, con fare rigido e polemico, si è rifiutato di darmi l'ostia - ha proseguito la donna - molti fedeli erano arrabbiati e lui si è praticamente messo a rispondere polemizzando durante l'eucarestia. Una cosa mai vista\". Al termine della messa, i parrocchiani ai quali sarebbe stata negata la partecipazione all'eucaristia si sarebbero dunque riuniti all'esterno dell'edificio religioso: delusi ed arrabbiati, non avrebbero nascosto il malcontento per quel che sarebbe avvenuto. Della storia sarebbe a quanto pare stato informato anche il vescovo di Arezzo - Cortona - Sansepolcro, Andrea Migliavacca. E a breve potrebbero quindi esserci ulteriori sviluppi.",

    "title": "WhatsApp enfrenta instabilidade e deixa usuários sem acesso nesta quarta-feira",
    "text": "Na tarde desta quarta-feira, 13 de agosto de 2025, o WhatsApp enfrentou uma instabilidade significativa que afetou milhões de usuários em todo o mundo, dificultando o envio e recebimento de mensagens, especialmente na versão web do aplicativo. A falha, que começou por volta das 16h no horário de Brasília, gerou reclamações em diversas regiões, com pico de relatos registrados por plataformas de monitoramento como o Downdetector. Usuários reportaram problemas como mensagens não enviadas, falhas na conexão com o servidor e dificuldades para acessar a versão desktop. A Meta, empresa responsável pelo aplicativo, ainda não emitiu um comunicado oficial sobre a causa da instabilidade, mas o impacto foi sentido em atividades pessoais e profissionais que dependem do serviço. A interrupção destacou a dependência global do WhatsApp como ferramenta essencial de comunicação, enquanto usuários buscavam alternativas para manter contato.\nA falha pegou muitos de surpresa, especialmente por ocorrer em um horário de alta demanda. Relatos nas redes sociais apontaram que o problema não se limitou ao Brasil, mas também atingiu países da América Latina, Europa e Ásia. O WhatsApp, com mais de 2 bilhões de usuários globalmente, é um dos principais meios de comunicação instantânea, e interrupções como essa geram transtornos significativos.\nPrincipais problemas relatados: dificuldade em enviar mensagens, falhas na versão web e erros de conexão. Regiões afetadas: Brasil, Argentina, Reino Unido, Índia, entre outros. Horário de pico: entre 16h e 18h, horário de Brasília. Plataformas de monitoramento: Downdetector registrou cerca de 4 mil reclamações no Brasil às 17h. Reações dos usuários e impacto imediato A instabilidade no WhatsApp gerou uma onda de reações nas redes sociais, onde usuários compartilharam frustrações e buscaram informações sobre a extensão do problema. Muitos recorreram a plataformas alternativas, como Telegram e Signal, para manter a comunicação. Profissionais que dependem do aplicativo para trabalho, como vendedores e prestadores de serviços, relataram dificuldades em contatar clientes, o que gerou atrasos em negociações e atendimentos. Pequenas empresas que utilizam o WhatsApp Business também foram impactadas, especialmente aquelas que operam com pedidos online.\nNo Brasil, onde o WhatsApp é amplamente utilizado para comunicação pessoal e comercial, a falha foi particularmente sentida. Usuários de cidades como São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e Belo Horizonte compartilharam capturas de tela mostrando mensagens travadas com o ícone de relógio, indicando que não foram enviadas. A ausência de um pronunciamento oficial da Meta intensificou a busca por respostas, com muitos questionando se a falha estava relacionada a atualizações recentes ou problemas de infraestrutura.\nSetores afetados: comércio eletrônico, atendimento ao cliente, comunicação corporativa. Alternativas utilizadas: Telegram, Signal, e-mails e chamadas telefônicas. Reações nas redes: hashtags como #WhatsAppCaiu ganharam destaque em plataformas como o X. A interrupção também reacendeu debates sobre a dependência de aplicativos centralizados para comunicação. Especialistas apontam que falhas como essa evidenciam a necessidade de diversificar ferramentas de contato, especialmente em contextos profissionais.\nHistórico de falhas e contexto técnico O WhatsApp não é estranho a instabilidades, embora interrupções globais sejam raras. Em julho de 2025, o aplicativo enfrentou uma falha semelhante, que afetou o envio de mensagens e a postagem de status por algumas horas. Na ocasião, a Meta atribuiu o problema a uma sobrecarga nos servidores, mas não detalhou as causas. A instabilidade desta quarta-feira, no entanto, parece ter tido um impacto mais amplo, especialmente na versão web, que depende de uma conexão estável entre o dispositivo móvel e os servidores da plataforma.\nProblemas técnicos em aplicativos de mensagens podem decorrer de falhas em servidores, atualizações mal-sucedidas ou até mesmo ataques cibernéticos. Embora não haja indícios de que a instabilidade de hoje tenha sido causada por um ataque, a falta de transparência da Meta sobre o ocorrido alimentou especulações. Engenheiros de tecnologia sugerem que o aumento do tráfego de dados, especialmente em horários de pico, pode sobrecarregar a infraestrutura do aplicativo, levando a falhas em cascata.\nCausas possíveis: sobrecarga de servidores, falhas em atualizações ou problemas de sincronização. Incidentes anteriores: julho de 2025, outubro de 2024, abril de 2024. Impacto técnico: falhas na sincronização entre a versão mobile e a web. A versão web do WhatsApp, que permite aos usuários acessar o aplicativo por navegadores, foi a mais afetada. Usuários relataram que, mesmo com conexão à internet estável, o aplicativo exibia mensagens de erro ou não carregava as conversas. Isso sugere que o problema pode estar relacionado à infraestrutura de servidores que gerenciam a sincronização entre dispositivos.\nMedidas tomadas e soluções temporárias Enquanto a Meta não se pronunciava oficialmente, usuários e especialistas compartilharam soluções temporárias para contornar a instabilidade. Muitos conseguiram recuperar o acesso ao aplicativo ao reiniciar o dispositivo ou reconectar a versão web escaneando novamente o código QR. Outros optaram por desinstalar e reinstalar o aplicativo, embora isso nem sempre resolvesse o problema. Em alguns casos, mudar para redes Wi-Fi ou dados móveis alternativos ajudou a restabelecer a conexão.\nSoluções sugeridas: reiniciar o dispositivo, limpar o cache do aplicativo, verificar a conexão de internet. Alternativas de comunicação: Telegram, Signal, iMessage (para usuários de iPhone). Ações preventivas: manter o aplicativo atualizado e evitar redes instáveis. Empresas que dependem do WhatsApp Business foram orientadas a migrar temporariamente para outros canais, como e-mails ou plataformas concorrentes, para evitar perdas. A instabilidade também destacou a importância de manter backups regulares das conversas, já que alguns usuários relataram dificuldades em restaurar mensagens após reinstalar o aplicativo.\nDependência global e lições do incidente A interrupção no WhatsApp expôs a dependência global de um único aplicativo para comunicação diária. Em países como o Brasil, onde o aplicativo é usado por mais de 120 milhões de pessoas, falhas como essa afetam desde conversas pessoais até transações comerciais. Pequenos negócios, que muitas vezes operam exclusivamente pelo WhatsApp, enfrentaram dificuldades para processar pedidos e responder a clientes. Escolas e grupos comunitários, que utilizam o aplicativo para coordenar atividades, também relataram transtornos.\nA falha também gerou discussões sobre a centralização de serviços digitais. Especialistas sugerem que empresas e indivíduos invistam em planos de contingência, como a adoção de múltiplas plataformas de comunicação. Aplicativos como Telegram e Signal, que oferecem funcionalidades semelhantes, ganharam visibilidade durante a instabilidade, com relatos de aumento no número de downloads.\nImpacto no Brasil: 120 milhões de usuários afetados, com destaque para pequenas empresas. Alternativas em alta: Telegram registrou aumento de 10% em downloads durante a falha. Recomendações: diversificar plataformas e manter backups regulares. A ausência de um comunicado oficial da Meta até o momento da redação desta notícia deixou usuários sem uma explicação clara sobre a causa da falha. Enquanto o serviço começava a ser restaurado em algumas regiões por volta das 19h, a instabilidade serviu como um lembrete da fragilidade dos sistemas digitais e da necessidade de maior transparência por parte das empresas de tecnologia.\nPróximos passos e expectativas Com a gradual retomada do serviço, os usuários aguardam esclarecimentos da Meta sobre o que causou a instabilidade. Atualizações no aplicativo ou melhorias na infraestrutura de servidores podem ser necessárias para evitar falhas futuras. Enquanto isso, a experiência reforça a importância de diversificar ferramentas de comunicação e manter backups atualizados. Pequenas empresas, em particular, devem considerar a adoção de sistemas alternativos para evitar interrupções em momentos críticos.\nA instabilidade também pode pressionar a Meta a investir em maior redundância em seus servidores, especialmente para a versão web, que tem se mostrado vulnerável em incidentes recentes. Usuários esperam que a empresa adote uma postura mais proativa na comunicação de falhas, oferecendo atualizações em tempo real para minimizar a incerteza.\nExpectativas dos usuários: comunicados oficiais, maior transparência, melhorias técnicas. Possíveis melhorias: redundância de servidores, atualizações mais estáveis. Ações recomendadas: diversificação de plataformas e backups frequentes. A instabilidade no WhatsApp, embora temporária, revelou a fragilidade de depender de um único serviço para comunicação global. Enquanto o aplicativo volta ao normal, a experiência serve como um alerta para usuários e empresas sobre a importância de estarem preparados para interrupções inesperadas.",

    "title": "How a Strong Warfighting Culture Guides the Spruance to Success",
    "text": "The foundation of the Navy’s Surface Force is a resilient and connected culture, enabling ships to thrive in challenging and austere maritime environments.\nDefining what warfighting culture and connectedness are and how they impact the readiness of a ship isn’t easy and can vary by command, but the fundamentals aren’t rocket science.\nFor the crew of Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Spruance (DDG 111), their building blocks are taking care of people, taking care of the ship, setting expectations, and uniting behind a clear vision of preparing Sailors to go to sea thrive, fight, and win.\n“We focus a great deal on treating people with dignity and respect,” said Cmdr. Christopher Ivey, Spruance’s commanding officer. “If you have trust, loyalty, and respect as your foundation, you can build a strong culture of ownership at every level and that brings connectedness for our crew. Spruance Sailors are proud to show off what they own and they aren’t afraid to make mistakes because they know their leadership will support them and teach them to re-attack the right way.”\nFor Ivey, this starts with instilling a strong culture early for young Sailors. Sitting down with every new crew member one-on-one, he articulates his command philosophy and emphasizes leadership’s expectations for each individual while describing their integral role in warfighting readiness. The result is each Sailor believes, soon after reporting to Spruance, they are part of something bigger than themselves.\nProfessional competency, Ivey notes, is one key to success.\n“I assign ownership to programs at the lowest competent level,” said Ivey. “That opens up opportunities for people to advance, make rank, and obtain advanced qualifications that wouldn’t normally be available to them.”\nGranting ownership at lower levels benefits the ship while giving Spruance Sailors earlier opportunities to succeed professionally and builds their confidence by honing Navy-specific skills. Thus, in the event of combat, as the ship shifts to an increased readiness condition such as general quarters, there’s more qualified Sailors available to every watch station. This greater depth in personnel will ensure mission success through a stronger and more flexible fighting team.\nIvey calls this “building the bench,” which is one of the command’s three leadership tenets. The other two are “planning to practice to execution” and “quality of service both at the waterfront and at home.”\nSpruance values servant leadership where supervisors are actively mentoring Sailors and guiding them through their personal and professional development. This gives Fire Controlman (AEGIS) 2nd Class Casey Kroger, work center supervisor for the combat fire control division, the opportunity to develop his leadership skills at an early stage in his career.\n“As a supervisor, I’m focused on training and preparing my Sailors, ensuring they have the mentorship they need, so when we are called to action, we have people who are ready to go to sea and effectively perform the missions we are tasked,” Kroger said.\nDrawing on his knowledge and experience, Kroger routinely helps Sailors learn about their equipment and increase their technological proficiency. This development focus not only leads to the enhanced readiness of the work center, but also the ship.\nSenior Chief Petty Officer Ilan Saulnier is the combat systems division leading chief petty officer (DLCPO) and acting senior enlisted leader for the whole department. Saulnier actively mentors junior enlisted and is also deeply invested in developing junior officers as well. It’s a roll he says increases connectedness and the proficiency of the crew.\nChief petty officers, Saulnier says, play an integral role in setting the tone for a connected crew and developing the ship’s strong warfighting culture. “I have an honest dialogue with Sailors, chiefs, and officers about what to expect and what ‘right’ is supposed to look like,” he said.\nSaulnier emphasizes the key to being prepared for the potential trials while on deployment is visualization. “We are a wartime institution,” he said. “Until we can visualize the fight, we will not be prepared for what is on the horizon.”\nFrom the top down, the ship has mentors who teach the crew qualities that make an effective Surface Warrior while it’s the connectedness of the crew that truly fosters a “next Sailor up” mentality among the crew that will be critical to sustaining and winning in the fight.\n“As Surface Warriors we fight with a shield wall, interlocked and ready to fight shoulder to shoulder, said Lt. Cmdr. Sean Lawlor, Spruance’s plans and tactics officer. “If you are taken out of the fight, someone will step up behind you and plug the gap,” he said. “In the day-to-day operations I could fall out sick and you bet there is another officer or principal assistant that will step up and get the job done.”\nAnd when culture and connectedness on one ship thrives, this enables Sailors to bring this mindset to other ships when they leave Spruance.\nLawlor believes the core processes developed and put in place by Spruance’s leadership can be replicated throughout the fleet and he hopes to be a part of the movement. “If we get culture and connectedness right on our ships, our warfighting readiness will thrive.”\n|Date Taken:||10.19.2023|\n 36|\n|Story ID:||461071|\n|Location:||SAN DIEGO, CA, US|\n|Web Views:||7|\n How a Strong Warfighting Culture Guides the Spruance to Success, by\n[LTJG Matthew Coffin](/portfolio/1820290/matthew-coffin),\nNo keywords found.",
