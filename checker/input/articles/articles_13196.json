    "text": "Troopers save elderly Lake George pair, pets from burning mobile home\nTroopers pulled two elderly Lake George residents out of their burning mobile home on the Thruway in Catskill.\nThe incident happened just before 3 p.m. State Police were dispatched to a vehicle fire on the right shoulder in the area of 107.6 southbound.\nThe 2005 Allegro motor home, which was towing a 2018 Jeep, had a mechanical failure and become fully engulfed in flames in excess of 20 feet, police said.\nThe door to the motor home was blocked because it was located close to the guide rail, according to police. The troopers were able to break the window out of the door with a baton and pulled the couple and their family pets to safety through the window.\nThe driver, 82-year-old Raymond J. Hanas and his 81-year-old passenger Patrica A. Grabley had minor injuries and smoke inhalation. They were evaluated by EMS at the scene and declined further medical treatment, police said.\nPolice credited the quick actions of the troopers for saving the lives of the family.",

    "text": "NEVADA COUNTY, Calif. — An investigation is underway after a PowerSchool data breach that could have taken some personal information from customers, like the\n[Pleasant Ridge Union School District](https://www.prsd.us/).\nThe\n[Grass Valley](/local) school district recently told families about a cybersecurity incident involving PowerSchool, a software that provides the student information system. The district was notified by PowerSchool on Jan. 7.\nOfficials said some of the information belongs to the district's families and educators. It includes data like contact information for students and parents and data elements like names and addresses.\n\"Across their (PowerSchool's) customer base, they have determined that some personally identifiable information (PII) was taken from some individuals. (PRUSD does not collect personally identifiable information like Social Security Numbers.) They are urgently working to complete their investigation and determine whether PII belonging to our students was included,\" said Superintendent Rusty Clark in a letter to parents.\nA full statement from PowerSchool is available below.\n\"On December 28, 2024, we became aware of a potential cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to certain PowerSchool SIS information through one of our community-focused customer portals, PowerSource. PowerSchool is not experiencing, nor expects to experience, any operational disruption and continues to provide services as normal to our customers.\nAs soon as we learned of the incident, we immediately engaged our cybersecurity response protocols and mobilized a cross-functional response team, including senior leadership and third-party cybersecurity experts.\nPowerSchool is committed to protecting the security and integrity of our applications. We take our responsibility to protect student data privacy and act responsibly as data processors extremely seriously.\nPowerSchool is committed to providing affected customers, families, and educators with the resources and support they may need as we work through this together.\"\nWATCH ALSO:",

    "title": "WATCH: Waves Topple Pier, Woman Caught in Surge During Crazy California Swell",
    "text": "A massive swell is absolutely pummeling California right now. In fact, it’s not just one swell; rather, a flurry of swells. Accordingly, surfers and surf spectators are flocking to the beaches up and down the coast to: 1) watch the swell from the presumed safety of the shore (not always the case), or 2) paddle out. But in some cases, and at some spots, there’s a little too much swell. View the original article to see embedded media. Like Capitola, CA – north of Big Sur, and south of surfing hotspots like Santa Cruz and the Golden State’s most revered big-wave spot, Mavericks, in Half Moon Bay. On Thursday, December 28 th , the swell was so big, so strong, so mighty that waves were washing over the pier (see above) and a rogue wave nearly swept a woman out to sea (see below). Chaos in Capitola. Just north, at Mavericks, a similar scene went down when a sneaker wave washed ashore and took down a flock of spectators trying to get a glimpse of California’s premier big-wave surfing destination. It was like a wet mop going at a trail of ants. This is just the beginning, too. More is on the way. Here’s the latest from surf forecasters, Surfline , regarding this run of swell: It’s already been an eventful week in California – especially north of Point Conception – and there is more to come. Finding the windows of favorable wind in between storms will be a challenge. Things to note:\n-Solid to locally XXL W-WNW swell Thu-Fri for California\n- Stormy wind for NorCal with some brief windows, SoCal AM wind is generally light\n- Another big W swell arrives over the weekend but wind is pretty tough statewide Stay tuned; stay safe. *** Don't miss another headline from SURFER!

El Grupo de Infancia y Adolescencia del Departamento de Policía Antioquia y el Gaula de la Policía Nacional rescataron a tres adolescentes en el corregimiento de Puerto Valdivia, en el municipio antioqueño de Valdivia, los cuales habían desaparecido hace 15 días en Funza, Cundinamarca. En una operación conjunta se dio el rescate de los adolescentes de 13, 14 y 15 años de edad en una operación conjunta. Uno de los menores había sido reportado como desaparecido desde el 13 de enero del 2024, y fue utilizado para extorsionar a sus padres, que recibieron exigencias de un rescate a nombre de un grupo armado.

Durante su atención médica, indicó que los demás estarían llegando a Tarazá. Así que las autoridades se pusieron en la tarea de hallarlos, lo cual se logró en Puerto Valdivia, cuando se encontraban con un adulto de 20 años, que actualmente está bajo investigación para determinar sus intenciones con respecto a los adolescentes.

El restablecimiento de derechos de los adolescentes se llevó a cabo junto con la comisaría de Puerto Valdivia. Adicionalmente, se adelantan las investigaciones del caso para proteger a los menores y determinar las responsabilidades correspondientes.",
