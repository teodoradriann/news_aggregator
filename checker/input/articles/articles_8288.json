    "text": "The evening before Russia invaded Ukraine, [it seemed](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-putin-wont-invade-ukraine/) to [many observers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/12/06/quick-take-why-putin-wont-invade-ukraine/?sh=5f6437812927) – [me included](https://theconversation.com/invading-ukraine-may-never-have-been-putins-aim-the-threat-alone-could-advance-russias-goals-177178) – nearly unimaginable that Putin would carry through with weeks of a threatened military attack. As I wrote at the time, Putin [is not as erratic or rash](https://theconversation.com/invading-ukraine-may-never-have-been-putins-aim-the-threat-alone-could-advance-russias-goals-177178) as he is sometimes painted. I had failed to take into account that Putin is, in the words [of French statesman and revolutionary](http://blog.catherinedelors.com/no-one-likes-armed-missionaries-or-what-the-french-revolution-could-teach-us) Maximilien Robespierre, an “armed missionary.” Writing in 1792, [Robespierre explained](http://blog.catherinedelors.com/no-one-likes-armed-missionaries-or-what-the-french-revolution-could-teach-us/), “The most extravagant idea that can take root in the head of a politician is to believe that it is enough for one people to invade a foreign people to make it adopt its laws and constitution. No one likes armed missionaries; and the first advice given by nature and prudence is to repel them as enemies.” Those words seem fitting as Vladimir Putin’s disastrous war in Ukraine drags on. Putin’s decision marked the beginning of a year of [massive destruction and death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63580372) in Ukraine and of extraordinary costs – both [economic](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/12/24/the-cost-of-war-russias-economy-faces-a-decade-of-regress-a79783) and [in lives lost](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-war-death-toll-soldiers-1763829) – for Russia. It was also a colossal blunder on Putin’s part: It has [weakened Russia significantly](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/31/1145981036/war-against-ukraine-has-left-russia-isolated-and-struggling-with-more-tumult-ahe), [solidified the NATO powers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/23/nato-unity-ukraine-tanks-lloyd-austin/) around the leadership of the United States and created a more unified, [nationally conscious Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3184593/ukraine-everything-so-patriotic-now-even-fashion-military) than had existed before the war. As a fading power, Putin’s Russia has refused to accept its own limitations, both economically and militarily. In invading its smaller neighbor, Russia made a bid to [upset the international system](https://doi.org/10.1163/18763324-04401006) [headed by the United States](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-united-states-moscow-5cc322a7ef3b0407c529ebf8bb1fbfd2). It also sought to establish its own hegemony over Ukraine, and by implication, over much of the former Soviet Union. But Russia’s failure to “ [decapitate” the Ukrainian government](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-believes-russia-planning-decapitate-ukraines-government-2022-02-24/), which in turn inspired heroic resistance by Ukrainians, proved a disastrous example of what might be called “ [imperial overreach](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/07/15/the-danger-of-imperial-overstretch/)” – when a state tries to expand or control other states beyond its own capacity to do so. It has produced a weakened Russia – an isolated pariah state perceived as a threat to democracies and the rules-based liberal international security system. Meanwhile, Putin’s diatribes against the West have evolved from [complaints about the expansion of NATO](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-putin/putin-criticizes-nato-expansion-as-alliance-holds-london-summit-idUSKBN1Y71K5) to attacking the [permissive culture of the West](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-06/putin-aims-to-triumph-in-battle-for-cultural-supremacy?sref=am1wYMj6&leadSource=uverify%20wall). Putin deploys rhetoric about dangerously subversive liberal, democratic values and practices – echoing right-wing politicians like [Hungary’s Victor Orbán](https://theconversation.com/viktor-orbans-use-and-misuse-of-religion-serves-as-a-warning-to-western-democracies-146277) and [Giorgia Meloni](https://theconversation.com/giorgia-meloni-the-political-provocateur-set-to-become-italys-first-far-right-leader-since-mussolini-190116), the far-right Italian leader. It appears that a new “International” – just as ominous to the liberal West as the Communist International was – is being formed of illiberal and authoritarian states, with Russia a key member. This view of the Ukrainian war as a cultural struggle plays in the Russian media as an emotional rallying cry to mobilize the basest fears of Putin’s people. [Propaganda disguised as news](https://theconversation.com/how-russias-unanswered-propaganda-led-to-the-war-in-ukraine-180202), social media posts and the screeds of government officials are being deployed to shape ordinary Russians’ perceptions of the war. The consequences of Putin’s miscalculation are not limited to the war itself, or to Europe. Rather, they have had reverberations far beyond the battlefields of Ukraine and the homes of Russians whose sons have been slaughtered or [fled abroad](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-men-leave-country-fearing-call-to-fight-in-ukraine). Putin’s imperial aggression against Ukraine – implausibly proclaimed to be a defense of a united Russia and of Ukrainian peoples against Nazi usurpers – has a long genealogy. Ever since his famous speech at the [Munich Security Forum in 2007](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/copy/24034), Russia’s president has [railed against the “unipolar](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-united-states-moscow-5cc322a7ef3b0407c529ebf8bb1fbfd2)” military and economic dominance of the United States. What he wants is “multipolarity” – that is, the ability of other great powers to hold sway over their neighborhoods. In such a multipolar world, Ukraine and Georgia would never join NATO and much of the former Soviet Union would fall under the umbrella of Russia. China would have paramount influence in East Asia, likewise India in South Asia. And perhaps this is Iran’s ambition in much of the Middle East. To countries hostile to the United States – and even to some friendly states – this multipolar rearrangement of the international order has considerable appeal. Yes, the war in Ukraine has solidified the Western alliance around its idea of the rules-based international order that has been in place since 1945. But it has also [awakened the aspirations of “the Global South](https://theconversation.com/as-ukraine-war-deepens-great-power-divisions-a-revitalized-non-aligned-movement-could-emerge-181136)” – those countries in neither NATO nor the former Soviet bloc, largely in the Southern Hemisphere. Countries from Latin America and Africa to Pacific Island nations have urged a greater dispersion and sharing of international clout. The two most populous countries in the world, India and China, [have expressed their support](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-g7-is-one-part-of-indias-pursuit-of-a-multipolar-world/) [for a new multipolar international order](https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt183p561) and have not been openly critical of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has also had ripple effects on other global tensions. With [Taiwan as a potential flashpoint](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/yearender-eye-storm-taiwan-centre-sino-us-tensions-2022-12-06/) and [saber-rattling by North Korea](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/26/asia/north-korea-missile-testing-year-end-intl-hnk/index.html), Japan, South Korea and the Philippines are gravitating toward closer military cooperation with the United States in East Asia. China and North Korea are moving in the opposite direction, closer to Russia. The Ukraine war is also [reshaping the long-festering conflict](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/14/1122895383/how-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-is-reshaping-the-armenia-azerbaijan-conflict) between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both states desire sovereign power over the disputed region of mountainous Karabakh. But with Russia bogged down militarily and economically, Putin has been disinclined to aid Armenia, its one loyal ally in the South Caucasus. This is despite the fact that Azerbaijan has [repeatedly violated the borders](https://www.france24.com/en/access-asia/20220913-deadly-clashes-erupt-along-azerbaijan-armenia-border) of its neighbor. Azerbaijan, by contrast, has been increasingly aided by its regional allies Israel – spurred by a shared hostility to Iran – and Turkey. Both have supplied Azerbaijan with advanced weaponry, giving the country an upper hand in the conflict. The Ukraine conflict also has an effect on the great global power struggle to come: China and U.S. With EU states and regional rivals to China forging closer ties with Washington, Beijing may eye a growing threat – or even an opportunity to exert its influence more aggressively as regional power dynamics evolve. American policymakers in both the Trump and Biden administrations have warned that the rise of China, economically and militarily, is a serious threat to the continued position of the U.S. as the strongest, richest state on the globe. To its competitors on the global stage, the U.S. also looks like an armed missionary. The uncertainty of the Ukraine war, and the still uncertain ways in which it is reshaping geopolitics, will do little to dislodge those fears. Rather, it may encourage international relations scholars, such as [Harvard professor Graham Allison](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/destined-war-can-america-and-china-escape-thucydidess-trap), who believe in the “Thucydides’ Trap.” Based on the ancient Greek historian’s explanation for the origins of the Peloponnesian War, the theory has it that when an emerging power threatens to displace a regional or global hegemon, war is inevitable. As someone trained to look to the past to understand the present and possible futures, I believe that nothing in history is inevitable; human beings always have choices. This was true for Putin on the eve of the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion, and it is true for policymakers around the world today. But the decision to invade Ukraine underscores a clear danger: When statesmen perceive the world as a Darwinian zero-sum game of winners and losers, a clash between the West and the rest, or as an ideological conflict between autocracies and democracies, they can create the conditions – through provocation, threat or even invasion – that lead to wars with unintended consequences.

    "text": "Goodwill in Mason opens to the public MASON, Mich. (WILX) - On Thursday, the Mason Area Chamber of Commerce held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Mason Goodwill Community Open House. The goal of the Goodwill is to serve as a hub for community engagement, support and be an amazing community resource. The Goodwill will take in donations from the community and provide affordable clothing and recourses to low income families. They also hope to provide new jobs to the area and help people become more financially self-sufficient. “I think we live in a time where we don’t understand poverty levels,” said Sharla Horton, the Mason Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director. “And I think items that come into Goodwill are at a price point that people can afford things for their home clothing, for their children, those kinds of things. So I think it’s just a good service for those people that don’t make a lot of money but can still have something nice to take home to, to sit on, to eat off from, to wear those kinds of things.” The Mason Goodwill is open till 8 p.m. six days a week and until 6 p.m. on Sunday.

    "text": "Efectivamente. Los datos de AEMET no dejan lugar a dudas : el episodio de altas temperaturas de esta semana es cosa del pasado. Ahora la península vivirá un pequeño alivio térmico, pero no durará mucho. En cuestión de días, las temperaturas volverán a subir. Ha tardado, pero el calor intenso ha llegado para quedarse. ¿Qué está pasando? Un pequeño golpe de suerte. La llegada de una vaguada y una masa de aire más fría ha provocado que la estabilidad que llevamos arrastrando durante la semana se deshaga. Eso va a provocar un descenso térmico generalizado en todo el país y de hasta 8 grados en zonas de Castilla y León, Navarra o Aragón. Esta entrada es lo que va a hacer que tampoco en esta ocasión se consigan reunir los requisitos para considerarla una ola de calor. No obstante, hay muchas zonas del interior de la mitad sur donde las temperaturas se van a quedar en 36-38 grados . Un alivio térmico con truco. El descenso de temperaturas viene acompañado de tormentas muy fuertes que, según Samuel Bierne r, \"dejarán decenas de litros en muy poco tiempo\". Hablamos de nucleos muy organizados en toda la zona de Cataluña, Aragón, el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana y algunos puntos de Castilla la Mancha. Es decir, entre 40 y 60 litros por metro cuadrado en cuestión de minutos. Eso complicará los próximos días en este cuadrante del país, porque no es solo la lluvia (y el posible granizo): es también el riesgo de crecidas súbitas en ramblas y barrancos. ¿Cuándo volverán a subir las temperaturas? El domingo. Ese será el día en que las temperaturas volverán a subir en la mayor parte del país y todo indica que el ascenso continuará durante el lunes. Hablamos de 40 grados en los valles del Guadalquivir, el Guadiana y el Tajo. El Alto Ebro también tendrá un episodio de calor, pero no intenso. Eso sí, los modelos predictivos dibujan algunos descensos en el Atlántico a partir del martes. El resultado final será una semana muy cálida, aunque los termómetros no llegarán a marcar las cifras de esta semana. Y ya estaríamos en agosto. Aunque, esta vez, no tenemos buenas noticias. AEMET acaba de publicar el pronóstico para el mes y todo indica que \"las próximas tres semanas serán, probablemente, más cálidas de lo normal en la práctica totalidad del país\". Es decir, que si se cumple el pronóstico \"buena parte de agosto transcurrirá con temperaturas muy altas\". La primera semana, además, será especialmente seca. Y, visto lo visto, el resto del verano se nos hará especialmente largo.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Nicollet County, Minnesota from 1901-2000 was 17.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Nicollet County, Minnesota experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Nicollet County, Minnesota history.",

    "title": "Clinging to debris, an esky in the ocean and staying put on a boat: Stories of survival from Florida's Hurricane Milton",
    "text": "In the days before its arrival, [Hurricane Milton](/news/2024-10-11/hurricane-milton-rips-through-florida-killing-10-people/104458662) was spoken about as a historic weather event facing Florida in the south-eastern United States. It was set to be the first major storm to make a direct hit on the state's Gulf of Mexico-facing Tampa Bay — a region with a population of more than 3 million — since 1921. Meteorologists sounded the alarm about forthcoming storm surges, life-threatening flooding, and strong winds after Milton intensified from a category one storm to the highest level of five in under a day, warning those in the storm's path remaining in their homes was not an option. Much of the powerful storm surges (an abnormal rise in sea level) feared never materialised. By landfall Wednesday night, the hurricane had lost some of its intensity and crossed Florida into the Atlantic as a category three storm. But it didn't come without leaving behind a trail of destruction in an already storm-battered state, destroying homes, whipping up a spate of tornadoes, and cutting off power to millions of properties. At least 12 people were confirmed dead in Milton's aftermath and that number may well rise as flow-on flooding continues to pose a threat in the days and weeks to come. Here are some stories of how people made it through the worst of the storm. A scene from Cast Away In Hillsborough County, a teenager survived after floating on a piece of debris in an area almost entirely submerged by floodwaters on Thursday. The local county sheriff's office posted a video to social media showing a rescue unit pulling the 14-year-old boy out of what appeared to be head-deep water and onto a boat. Surrounding properties and cars were seen swamped at the time. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister told CNN the boy was laying on a broken fence when the rescue boat circled around, and appeared in clear distress. \"He was waving us down, flagging us down … most (other) people were saying 'hello'. He was frantically flailing his arms,\" Mr Chronister said. \"We went over, and it literally was like the scene of a Cast Away movie, how he's hanging on for dear life. His mum evacuated him to a safer area last night, he was walking home, and didn't realise the water was going to get as flooded as deep as it did, and he's not a great swimmer, hence the rescuing. \"He was visibly shaken. He hugged us. He was just so grateful that we took him to some dry land.\" About 200 people were rescued from floodwaters elsewhere in Hillsborough county, including 135 residents of an assisted living facility. Esky in the Atlantic Loading...Near the town of Longboat Key in Sarasota County on Thursday, a man was found floating in open waters about 50km offshore, clinging to an ice chest. US Coast Guard officials found him on the cooler following an eight-hour search operation that was launched after reports the captain of a fishing vessel had gone missing hours before the storm made landfall. On Wednesday afternoon, Captain Dave had gone out to his boat to make repairs, two days after it got disabled at sea and a rescue crew had to be sent out to bring back its crew. The boat's rudder malfunctioned again while he attempted to transit back to port, stranding the captain in rough weather. US Coast Guard officials instructed him to put on a life jacket and remain with the ship's locator radio — which is how he was ultimately found the next day. \"This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,\" Sector St. Petersburg's command centre chief, Dana Grady, said. \"To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph (120 -144kph) winds, 20-25 foot (6-7m) seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. \"He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.\" Defiant 'Lieutenant Dan' Tampa resident Joseph Malinowski became something of a social media sensation after deciding to weather Hurricane Milton — and Helene two weeks earlier — on his sailboat. It has since emerged that Malinowski has a criminal history and was once accused of trying to set a woman on fire. In April 2022, he was released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for punching a police officer in the nose, News and Public Media for North Central Florida reports (WUFT). Last year, in a separate case, he was reportedly arrested for aggravated battery after a woman alleged he poured petrol on a park bench she was sitting on. Malinowski then set the bench on fire before allegedly pouring petrol over the woman, who feared for her life as she was smoking a cigarette, WUFT reports.The case was later dropped without explanation by prosecutors. The 54-year-old, dubbed \"Lieutenant Dan\", walked away unscathed from both storms after refusing to comply with authorities' pleas for taking shelter. University of Tampa student Terrence Concannon documented the course of Mr Malinowski's sailboat encounters on TikTok over days, including his preparations, refusal to budge when officers came along, and moments post-survival. \"Hell no,\" Lieutenant Dan said, when asked if he'd be wearing a life jacket in case his boat capsized. \"The water's going to come in, it's going to rise. If you're on land, it's going to flood, you're risking drowning,\" he said, explaining his decision . \"I'm on a boat. A boat goes up with the water. So even if the boat goes up a 100ft in the air, I'm going to be 100ft up in the air with the water. \"The safest place in the world to be, is in my boat.\" Mr Malinowski has been homeless for more than a decade, he told NBC News, and has half his leg amputated. He told local media outlets he felt \"fine\" after the hurricane had passed on Thursday afternoon, even as strong winds and roiling waters pummeled his sailboat into Tampa Bay Harbour.",

Y, con la incorporación de Suecia hoy, la OTAN está más unida, decidida y dinámica que nunca ahora que cuenta con 32 naciones”, dijo en un comunicado difundido por la Casa Blanca. MIRA AQUÍ: [Estado de la Unión EN VIVO: Joe Biden se alista para un discurso que podría definir las elecciones] La histórica entrada de Suecia en el organismo se certificó cuando el primer ministro sueco, Ulf Kristersson, hizo entrega del instrumento de acceso al secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Antony Blinken, en la capital estadounidense. Estocolmo solicitó entrar en la OTAN en mayo de 2022 junto a Finlandia. Aunque en un primer momento se esperaba que la inclusión de Suecia fuera casi inmediata tras la petición, las reticencias de Turquía y Hungría han retrasado el ingreso. “Cuando (el presidente ruso, Vladímir) Putin lanzó su brutal guerra de agresión contra el pueblo de Ucrania, pensó que podía debilitar a Europa y dividir a la OTAN. En cambio, Suecia y Finlandia -dos de nuestros socios más cercanos, con dos Ejércitos altamente capacitados- tomaron la decisión histórica de solicitar el ingreso de pleno derecho en la OTAN”, recordó Joe Biden. MÁS INFORMACIÓN: [Biden ordenará establecer un puerto de ayuda humanitaria en Gaza durante el Estado de la Unión] Con la llegada de Suecia, según insistió, se reafirma que los valores democráticos que comparten sus miembros hacen de la OTAN “la mayor alianza militar en la historia del mundo”. “Junto con nuestro aliado más reciente, Suecia, la OTAN seguirá defendiendo la libertad y la democracia durante generaciones. Estoy deseando recibir a los 32 aliados en la cumbre del 75º Aniversario de la OTAN, que se celebrará este verano en Washington D.C”, concluyó Biden.

Le autorità locali hanno annunciato che le tradizionali luci non saranno posizionate come solitamente accade in ogni angolo di Betlemme, mentre per la prima volta l'antistante Piazza della Mangiatoia non sarà allestita con il tradizionale albero di Natale e le decorazioni festive. Al suo posto è stata installata un'opera d'arte chiamata 'Natività sotto le macerie'.\nL'evento è stato inaugurato ieri sera da Rula Maayah, ministra palestinese del Turismo, e Hana Hananiyeh, sindaco di Betlemme. L'opera d'arte raffigura il presepe tra i resti di un edificio demolito, a simboleggiare la sofferenza dei palestinesi di Gaza.\n\"Questo è il messaggio: il mondo intero sta festeggiando il Natale, ma non Betlemme. Betlemme quest'anno celebra il Natale in modo diverso dicendo al mondo che la Palestina sta soffrendo. Che Betlemme sta soffrendo. Questa Betlemme festeggia il Natale dalle macerie. Non come tutte le altre persone al mondo\", ha detto Maayah.\nnatale Guerra betlemme Contenuto in: La guerra Israele-Hamas STORIA",

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
