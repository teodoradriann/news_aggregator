    "text": "Alerta en Neuquén y Río Negro por viento y fuertes ráfagas este domingo: cuáles son las zonas afectadas El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional informó que este domingo se volverán a repetir las ráfagas que ronden los 100 km/h, pero se espera que no repercuta en el Alto Valle. Los detalles. [https://www.rionegro.com.ar/sociedad/alerta-por-fuertes-vientos-en-neuquen-como-va-a-estar-el-fin-de-semana-3866018/] Noviembre arrancó con [fuertes vientos en toda la provincia de Neuquén](https://www.rionegro.com.ar/sociedad/fuertes-vientos-en-neuquen-y-rio-negro-a-que-hora-llegan-las-rafagas-mas-fuertes-3864941/). Desde el Servicio Metereorológico Nacional (SMN) anunciaron alerta amarilla para este viernes y, si bien se espera que el contexto mejore este sábado, el domingo se replicará el mismo panorama en gran parte del norte de la Patagonia. Según precisaron, gran parte de Neuquén estará afectada por vientos del oeste, con velocidades entre 50 y 65 km/h, y ráfagas que puedan superar los 100 km/h. Asimismo, la alerta amarilla regirá para toda la provincia salvo para Confluencia, Añelo, Pehuenches y Picún Leufú. Qué pasa en Río Negro este domingo A su vez, también se aguardan ráfagas que ronden los 100 km/h en las mesetas de Pilcaniyeu y Ñorquinco; y en 9 de Julio, 25 de Mayo y el oeste de El Cuy. El viento soplará desde el oeste a más de 50 km/h y se estima que la tarde sea el horario de mayor incidencia. Un freno al viento y al calor Desde la Autoridad Interjurisdiccional de Cuencas (AIC) anticiparon que este sábado habrá un parate, no sólo con respecto al viento, sino también al calor en la ciudad. Se espera que la mínima durante la mañana sea de 2ºC, mientras que la máxima durante la tarde llegará a los 23ºC. A su vez, será una jornada mayormente despejada en la capital, salvo por algunas nubes durante la noche. Por otro lado, habrá una leve brisa durante las primeras horas del día provenientes del sudeste. Para la tarde, cambiará de sentido y vendrá desde el nordoeste, con ráfagas a 24 km/h, las cuales irán perdiendo intensidad al llegar a la noche. Alerta por viento este domingo: qué pasa en la capital Ya en el fin de la semana, se esperan fuertes ráfagas en la ciudad de Neuquén, pero no durante toda la jornada. La AIC señaló que durante la mañana del 3 de noviembre, el viento vendrá desde el oeste a 34 km/h y las ráfagas llegarán a 76 km/h. Sin embargo, para la tarde, el viento surcará desde el sudoeste a 24 km/h, con ráfagas a 38 km/h. Por otro lado, también volverá el calor y la máxima anunciada es de 27ºC.",

Using fresh vegetables, fruits, spices and seasonings, he puts out six premium salsas ($10) including mango and prickly pear varieties, plus his newest additions: salsa verde with tomatillos and green chiles, and Santa Muerte, a blistering blend of chiltepin, chipotle, ghost and reaper peppers.

    "text": "Argomenti trattati\nUcraina, Papa Francesco: appello per la negoziazione e la pace\nPapa Francesco ha recentemente espresso parole significative riguardo alla situazione in Ucraina e in Palestina durante la sua apparizione su Cliché, un magazine culturale in onda sulla Radiotelevisione svizzera. Le sue dichiarazioni sono un appello alla negoziazione e alla ricerca di soluzioni pacifiche per i conflitti in corso.\nSituazione in Ucraina\nIl Papa ha sottolineato l’importanza del coraggio nella ricerca della pace, incoraggiando l’Ucraina a considerare la possibilità di negoziare per porre fine al conflitto e salvare vite umane. Ha enfatizzato che il vero coraggio risiede nel riconoscere la situazione attuale, pensare al bene del popolo e avere il coraggio di alzare la bandiera bianca e avviare trattative di pace. Il Pontefice ha sottolineato che il negoziato non è una resa, ma piuttosto un atto di coraggio per evitare un ulteriore deterioramento della situazione.\nAppello alla negoziazione\nIl Santo Padre ha evidenziato che la parola “negoziare” porta con sé un significato di coraggio, specialmente quando ci si trova in una situazione di sconfitta e le prospettive appaiono cupe. Ha esortato le parti coinvolte nel conflitto ad agire tempestivamente e cercare mediatori neutrali per avviare un dialogo costruttivo.\nIl ruolo di Papa Francesco\nIl\nPapa ha anche fatto riferimento al suo ruolo personale nella promozione della pace, menzionando di aver inviato una lettera agli ebrei di Israele per stimolare una riflessione sulla situazione attuale. Ha chiarito che il suo impegno per la negoziazione non rappresenta una resa, bensì un atto di coraggio, sottolineando la necessità di prevenire ulteriori sofferenze e tragedie.",

    "title": "90-year-old Richmond woman sets sight on 26th marathon - Richmond News",
    "text": "A decade ago, the headline read “She’s 80 and running strong.” Now, 10 years later, Gwen McFarlan is itching to return to running and is determined to complete a marathon in her ninetieth year. This will be just one more on top of the 25 full marathons she’s already done in the past 30 years. At the moment, McFarlan has a slight setback with her running as she needs to have a leaky heart valve fixed, but she expects that to be done soon so she can get back to pounding the pavement. McFarlan turns 90 on Thursday (April 4) and she has three major races planned for this year – the Sun Run in April, which she plans to walk, the UBC 5K Longest Day in June and the Forever Young 8K in September. The 8K is organized by the Richmond group Forever Young, which she’s a fixture at. McFarlan credits her love of running and physical activity in general to an active childhood. Growing up in Moose Jaw, Sask., McFarlan was surrounded by boys whose games and activities she wanted to be a part of. “I became the pest – I wanted to do everything they did,” McFarlan said. Her advice to parents on how to bring up kids is to tell them: “Go outside and play.” McFarlan’s list of races she’s won is long – and running has taken her around the continent. One of her most memorable running events was participating in the \"Goofy\" at Disney World in Florida. This event involved completing a 10-kilometre race, a half-marathon and a marathon, all in a single weekend. This earned her the Goofy Award. The Boston Marathon, where she placed sixth in her age category in 2002, was another race to remember. Just being part of this famed race was an experience, McFarlan explained, and she might have achieved a better time if she hadn’t slowed down to high-five students along the way and greet care home residents also lining the race path. McFarlan started running at the age of 60 and along with friend and fellow runner Joan Young, they started the “Kilometre Run” at Tomsett elementary where they were both teachers. Around this age, McFarlan was diagnosed with osteoporosis and was told she needed to “pound” in order to get her bones stronger. “The only way I could pound was to run,” she said. Since then, she’s placed first in numerous races across North America. Just last year, at 89, she came first in her age category at the 10-kilometre Vancouver Sun Run with a time of 1:27:58. She also set Canadian records at two BC Seniors Games, in the 5,000-metre and 10-kilometre races. McFarlan finds running an accessible sport. “All you have to do is open the door,” she said. However, she noted that running does require good shoes and waterproof clothing. Injuries have come along the way including a stress fracture to her hip, a broken wrist, a broken tooth as well as a broken ankle. The last one forced her to do “pool running” for rehab until it healed, allowing her to return to running on a hard surface. McFarlan can be seen several times a week with her fellow Forever Young members taking long, rigorous walks around Richmond, which brings a social aspect to her favourite activity. And her physical fitness routine inspires others to keep pounding the pavement. “Gwen is the one who gets us out of bed and she’s always ready to go,” said Young.

    "title": "Are Narcissists Delusional?",
    "text": "I have a feeling you’re going to have some real insight to this piece.\nIn fact, I’d hedge bets that you’re already laughing about a certain delusion the narcissist in your life has had over the time you’ve known them.\nYes, it’s true that narcissists come with a self-centered air of delusion around them. But it’s more than that. It goes beyond simply thinking they’re the best, or that they live in a world of their own.\nIt actually almost makes me pity the narcissist, actually.\nI said almost…\nSo – what is it about delusion that seems to sit so well with narcissists?\nDid You Say Delusional?\nHard to believe, right?\nWrong!\nDelusion goes hand in hand with anybody narcissistic. If you’re unlucky enough, you’ll get to witness it in action.\nNarcissists really do believe they are a gift from God. They act as though they’re walking angels upon this green earth, and that everybody must stop and be in constant awe of them.\nOh dear.\nOnly those who are clued up on narcissism can see through this act.\nThe Driving Force of a Narcissist\nDelusion has to be the driving force behind all narcissistic people. If they were just themselves, they wouldn’t get a fraction of the attention they get in the shoes of their masked alter-egos.\nThey need those delusional thoughts in order to impress.It’s how they justify their heavily entitled view of themselves.\nAnd it’s how they get the average person to fall at their feet and believe every single word they say.\nExamples of Narcissistic Delusion\nSo let’s get right into this!\n#1 That They’re The Best\nShow me a narcissist who doesn’t think they’re the best, and I will show you a fake narcissist.\nNow, it doesn’t matter at all what ‘the best’ is defined as, because narcissists don’t always have to be specific.\nThis can be anything from, “I am so much better than everybody in this room, I’m almost bored,” to, “I am the best and nobody is better than me in the whole world!”\nWhen thinking about this form of delusion, you can also get way more specific.\n“I work as a hairdresser, and I am the best in my field. I would do a much better job than any celebrity stylist.”\n“I was chosen for the promotion because there is literally nobody else in the world who is able to do the job as well as I can.”\n“My child cannot even do their homework by themselves. They need me to help them with their math, obviously the teacher doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”\nIn reality, they might be great at their job, or exceptional at math. Does that make them ‘the best?’ Define the best, anyway? Narcissists don’t care about who else might come in and be better, they don’t want to talk about it.\nFor them, they are the best, and that’s final.\n#2 They’re Never Wrong\nYou know, you could back a narcissist into a corner of a room and tell them they’re wrong, and they still wouldn’t believe you.\nNarcissists. Always. Have. To. Be. Right. It goes so much deeper than that, though! This is not just wanting to be right, it’s automatically knowing they’re always right.\nNobody argues. Nobody Questions. Everybody accepts.\nIt’s delusional for obvious reasons, right?\nI mean, nobody on this earth is right all the time. Nobody.\nWe get things wrong. We misjudge. We misinterpret. We count change wrong. We sometimes pay our bills late because we forget.\nThese things are nobody’s fault but ourselves. And we don’t mean to, but we’re human. So how can you convince a narcissist that they’re wrong?\nYou can’t! Stop wasting your time!\n#3 Everyone Loves Them\nNot true. A lot of people will dislike the narcissist in your life, even if it doesn’t seem that way to you. The reason they dislike them is because they long figured out who the person behind the mask was.\nYou’ll hear words like, ‘arrogant,’ or, ‘sensitive,’ or even, ‘miserable.’ Narcissists are good at blanking people who don’t matter in that moment, and those people, it can actually seem rude. It’s enough for them to make their own minds up.\nThen of course, you’ll have those who have had direct run-ins with them. The ex partners too.\nThe fact is – they aren’t loved, or even liked, by some people.\nNarcissists are way too ignorant and entitled to be aware of this, as they live firmly in their own egotistical bubble.\n#4 They’re Never Afraid\nNarcissists live in a world of fear, but you’d never know. The reason you’d never know is because they hide it so well. It’s the reason their personality is seemingly so big. They’re some of the most confident people you’ll ever meet.\nNarcissists also love to tell people who much they’re worth, or the adventures they seek. They play on their own strengths daily, and will ensure you know everything there is to know about them.\nNow let’s dig a little deeper…\nNarcissists act. They play – and when I say it, I really mean it. They have not got a brave bone in their body. They fear you leaving, they fear not being good enough, and they fear being caught out.\nWhat does that tell you about them?\nWell, personally speaking, I feel it leaves narcissists looking as though they constantly need to fit in. They have to. Not wanting to be the ones left out, it’s in their best interests for people to see them as ‘one of them.’\nAs a result, these toxic people are going to do what it takes to hide their utmost fears that derive from needing to be perfect from a young age.\nThey will bury their fears, and hide them with a personality so toxic that nobody will suspect what’s underneath. The charm will coat their insecurities, but this coat will eventually wear off.\nNarcissists don’t see it that way – as they deem themselves a force of unbreakable nature. Their delusion is wrapped around the idea that they are better than everybody else, and will forever remain so.\n#5 Finances…\nThis is probably the most entertaining of all. Narcissists love to appear rich because it gives them a boost to the status they’re trying to live by. If something has a price tag on it, you’re going to need to assume two things:\n- The price tag is the most expensive. To the narcissist, if you own a lot, you’re worth a lot.\n- The narcissist is living an enviable life where they can simply afford to buy whatever they want.\nBoth are delusional. Money is materialistic, and you cannot buy a kind heart or soul with it. The right people won’t be impressed by price tags.",

    "text": "(Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\nAfter a disappointing short stint with the Denver Broncos, one-time Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson has been given a chance at another fresh start in the NFL by signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers to become their new starter under center.\nEven though the Steelers did not wait long before creating a quarterback controversy by trading for Justin Fields, who was pushed out of town due to the Chicago Bears drafting Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick, Wilson presumably will start the upcoming 2024 NFL season on top of the depth chart at the quarterback position.\nUnfortunately for Wilson, an injury issue has popped up at the start of training camp with the Steelers, as longtime head coach Mike Tomlin let it be known that the veteran quarterback was held out of practice on Thursday due to a calf issue, resulting in Fields getting first-team reps, according to Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\n#Steelers QB Russell Wilson woke up with a calf issue this morning and was held out of practice, per HC Mike Tomlin. He’s considered day-to-day. Justin Fields took first-team reps. pic.twitter.com/fxH0wco0JK\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) July 25, 2024\nAt 35 years old, with as many miles as Wilson has on his body from all the games played with the Seattle Seahawks and Broncos, a calf issue is a legitimate concern because it can lead to a more severe problem like a torn Achilles tendon, like fellow veteran quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers, suffered last year with their respective teams.\nIt’ll be interesting to see how the Steelers handle this calf issue and if it helps give Fields an opportunity to jump ahead of the veteran on the depth chart in Pittsburgh.",
