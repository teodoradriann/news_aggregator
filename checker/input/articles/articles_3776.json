    "title": "Tech giants stumble: Communication services slump amid mixed market signals",
    "text": "Sector Overview\nThe stock market is showcasing a mixed bag of performances today, characterized by a notable decline in communication services, while some tech giants experience pressure. Simultaneously, healthcare and consumer defensive sectors are displaying strength.\n- 📉 Communication Services: This sector is seeing substantial declines, with Google (GOOG) facing a significant drop of 1.52%. Meta (META) also falls by 0.36%, reflecting cautious investor sentiments.\n- 📈 Healthcare: On the brighter side, the healthcare sector is gaining traction. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and AbbVie (ABBV) are shining, with ABBV rising notably by 1.40% and LLY climbing 1.03%.\n- 🔋 Consumer Defensive: Companies such as Walmart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG) are up by 1.19% and 0.74%, respectively, suggesting stability and investor confidence in defensive plays.\nMarket Mood and Trends\nThe prevailing market sentiment is one of caution, as investors weigh mixed cues from various sectors. The drop in communication services might indicate looming concerns or reactions to sector-specific dynamics. In contrast, gains in healthcare and consumer defensive suggest that investors may be seeking safe havens amidst the volatility.\nStrategic Recommendations\nInvestors should consider adjusting their portfolios to mitigate exposure to sectors experiencing declines, particularly communication services. Diversifying into healthcare stocks or consumer defensive plays could provide some stability and growth potential. Keeping an eye on upcoming news or reports from major tech companies might be prudent, as they could sway future market trends significantly.\nFor more insights and real-time updates, keep visiting ForexLive.com for comprehensive analysis and expert opinions on market movements.",

    "text": "PARIS: The water quality of the Seine has improved, test results showed on Thursday, three weeks ahead of the start of the Paris Olympics when the river is set to host outdoor swimming events. Results published by the Paris mayor´s office showed that E.Coli bacteria levels at an Olympics swimming spot in central Paris had fallen to within acceptable limits for four days in a row following warm and sunny weather in the French capital. “This positive development is a consequence of the return of sunshine and warmth as well as the effects of the work done as part of the strategy to improve the quality of the Seine´s waters,” a statement from the mayor´s office said. The period covered June 24-July 2. The previous week, levels of E.Coli -- a bacteria indicating the presence of faecal matter -- had been above the upper limits used by sports federations every day at the Alexandre III bridge location in central Paris, which is set to be the jumping off point for the swimming. At one point, E.Coli levels were 10 times the upper limit of 1,000 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres (cfu/ml), with heavy rain over the previous two months leading to fears for the Olympic events. The Seine is set to be used for the swimming leg of the triathlon on July 30-31 and August 5, as well as the open-water swimming on August 8-9. The readings for enterococci bacteria last week -- a second key measurement of water quality -- also improved markedly and were within acceptable limits every day at the Alexandre III bridge. French authorities have spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in the last decade trying to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewerage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities. But major storms still overwhelm the capital´s waste water network, some of which dates back to the 19th century, leading to discharges of untreated sewage directly into the river.

    "title": "'I would be bragging about it too': Trump economic adviser admits Biden economy is 'good'",
    "text": "'I would be bragging about it too': Trump economic adviser admits Biden economy is 'good'\n(Image: Screengrab via X / @atrupar)\nLarry Kudlow, who served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in then-President Donald Trump's administration, recently acknowledged that President Joe Biden is overseeing a strong economy.\nIn a Fox Business appearance on Thursday, Kudlow pointed to the news that the US economy grew by 3.3% in the 4th quarter of 2023 as evidence of the strength of the economy heading into an election year. That increase is much higher than the projected 2% growth forecasted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. While that level of growth could be partially attributed to higher than average spending in a holiday season, the fact that expectations were shattered is a byproduct of other positive factors, like higher wages, lower costs and a decrease in the rate of inflation.\n\"Yes, I'm an honest broker, he got a good 3.3% for the fourth quarter, following a good 4.9% in the third quarter, OK?\" Kudlow said. \"If I were he, I would be bragging about it too. And inflation has come down. All's fair in love, war and politics. Brag when you can. I get it. I've been there.\"\nPOLL:\nShould Trump be allowed to hold office again?\nWhile his term began with a rocky start given the mass layoffs and broken global supply chains as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden has presided over a massive turnaround after his first three years in office. As NEC director Lael Brainerd stated in December, the US unemployment rate has remained under 4% for the longest stretch\nin more than five decades, and wage growth is outpacing inflation, meaning more workers have more money in their pockets.\nCosts are also coming down for many Americans. Bloomberg reported on Monday that median rents — typically the biggest monthly expense for millions across the country — have declined for\neight consecutive months. A gallon of gas costs roughly 34 cents less today than it did at this time last year. And while food prices have gone up, the rate at which they've increased is far lower. Nerdwallet found that while groceries went up in price by more than 2% between December of 2022 and December of 2023, that pales in comparison to the 10% increase that happened during that same window between 2021 and 2022.\nThe stock market has also fared well under Biden's leadership, in spite of Trump's October 2020 prediction that markets would crash. In fact, the S&P 500 closed at an all time high of over 4,839 last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average\nclosed above 38,000 this week for the first time in history. Biden's economic performance has also been touted by his fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives, who will be sharing a ballot line with him this November. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pennsylvania) pointed out that a side-by-side comparison of the Trump and Biden economies shows Biden's has been more prosperous.\n\"The 3.3 percent GDP increase in [the fourth quarter] of 2023 caps off a year of exceptional growth for our economy,\" Boyle stated. \"With last year’s numbers, average annual GDP growth for the first three years of the Biden administration comes in at 3.4 percent, far outpacing the 2.6 percent during the first three years of the Trump administration.\"\nREAD MORE:\n'Longest stretch in 50 years': Unemployment historically low despite experts' predictions\nWatch the video of Kudlow's comments below, or by\nclicking this link.

    "text": "HOLLAND, Mich. — After 32 years of carrying the sandy feet of beachgoers to and from the waterfront in Holland, the stairs at Laketown Beach Park are gone.\nThe stairs were initially closed on March 26 due to safety concerns. Deconstruction of the stairs began on April 17 and the remaining debris is expected to be cleaned up by May 9.\nThe Laketown Parks Commission is now in the process of considering new stair designs to help beachgoers access Lake Michigan.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, the commission held a special meeting where they reviewed two options for possible stairways.\nThe commission did not reach a decision at that meeting and asked Matt Levandoski, senior landscape architect for the engineering firm Prein&Newhof, to come back with modifications for a May 21 meeting.\nThe original options presented were to build a stairway from \"the plateau,\" or the area just west of the parking lot, through an area called \"the bowl\" and to the beach.\nBoth options offer 220 feet of 5-foot-wide wooden stairs with railings that would be north of where the previous stairs existed.\nOption one:\nThe commission said the first option presented was called the \"Get 'er done approach\" by Levandoski.\nThis option would essentially create a stairway that was a straight line down the dune with nine landings.\nThe cost of the stairway is estimated to be $137,500. However, with the removal of old snow fences and the addition of fencing, the estimated total cost would increase to $163,575.\nOption two:\nThe second option would create a stairway that \"zigzags\" through the dune with resting and viewing balconies and benches.\nThis option is pricier, with an estimated cost of $181,250. With the removal of old snow fences and the addition of fencing, the total estimated cost of this plan comes out to $207,325.\nThe price tag for both options could creep even higher with site restoration costs.\nThe commission said Levandoski also estimated what the total costs could come out to if they added dune grass plantings, shrubs, trees and snow fences. With those costs included, option one's estimate increases to $247,835 and option two's increases to $291,585.\nWith proper maintenance, Levandoski estimated the stairs would last 20-30 years.\nTo help with these costs, the township has around $115,000 of remaining budgeted funds in a capital improvements fund and cost savings. That money could be made available for the project if the board of trustees approves, according to Interim Manager Steven Ringelberg.\nDuring the May 6 meeting, the commission asked Levandoski to come back to their next meeting with modifications made to option one, adding more balconies and benches.\nIn the meantime, as the weather warms up this week, anyone hoping to stop by Laketown Beach Park will face a hike to get to and from the water. The commission asked that parks staff place signs warning visitors of the difficulty they may face getting to and from the beach without stairs.\nThey were also asked to place signs warning beachgoers not to step onto the private property along the sides of the beach to use those stairs.\nThere are no restrictions in place preventing beachgoers from making the climb. However, the parks commission just asks that beachgoers remain on the marked paths to protect the dune.\nThat path is through \"the bowl,\" which has a steep drop with a flat bottom. Beachgoers are asked to stay off the edges of the bowl and avoid disturbing the dune grass.\nIf you decide to visit the beach, you're also asked to heed the no trespassing signs and follow other rules of the beach.",

    "text": "Vagones, taquillas y andenes en distintas líneas del Metro amanecieron este 27 de marzo con cartulinas colocadas por trabajadores adheridos al Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores del Sistema de Transporte Colectivo en demanda de mejores condiciones laborales, prestaciones y aumento salarial.\nEn un documento dirigido al director del Metro y al secretario de Finanzas, los agremiados del sindicato, encabezado por Fernando Espino, piden que se ejerza el presupuesto de servicios médicos, laboratorios y medicamentos.\nPublicidad “Exigimos el pago inmediato a los servicios médicos, ya que se ve afectada nuestra salud”, se lee en una de las cartulinas.\nSeñala que la colocación de cartulinas en las instalaciones se deriva de la falta de pago a la prestación médica, lo que afecta a más de 15,000 trabajadores y sus familias.\nLa representación sindical del Metro advierte que su protesta es solo mediante la colocación de cartulinas en espacios que sean visibles para los usuarios, sin que afecte el servicio o seguridad de quienes usan las 12 líneas.\nDesencuentros y denuncias entre el Sindicato y Calderón\nEl 2023 estuvo marcado por una serie de desencuentros entre el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores del Sistema de Transporte Colectivo; el director del Metro, Guillermo Calderón, y el Gobierno de la Ciudad de México.\nComo cada año, la representación sindical solicitó un aumento en el presupuesto, así como mejoras salariales a la base trabajadora. También denunciaron el cierre de clínicas y un declive en la calidad de los servicios de salud para sus agremiados y familias.\nSin embargo, ese año se sumó una nueva denuncia: las fallas en los sistemas de comunicación “Tetra”, que se encarga de enlazar las cabinas de los conductores y el Puesto Central de Control.\nEsta situación obliga a los conductores a utilizar su teléfono y Whatsapp para comunicarse entre ellos y el centro de mando.\nPublicidad Sindicato acusa al director del Metro de fallas. (Foto: Especial)\nLa problemática se agravó en enero de 2023 tras el choque de dos trenes en la Línea 3 del Metro, entre las estaciones Potrero y La Raza, así como distintos incidentes que afectaron el servicio semanas posteriores.\nUn dictamen de la Fiscalía de la Ciudad de México atribuyó el accidente y otras fallas en el servicio del Metro a una presunta “negligencia” o “sabotaje” por parte de los trabajadores, acusación que fue negada por el líder sindical.\nComo medida de protesta y para evidenciar las fallas en la comunicación mediante el sistema “tetra”, en marzo de 2023 el sindicato del Metro convocó a sus agremiados a trabajar sin el uso de celulares.\nDesde el 17 de marzo, los trabajadores del metro colocaron pancartas en vagones y andenes (David Santiago) En noviembre de 2023, surgió otro desencuentro entre el sindicato y el director del Metro por una denuncia relacionada con el riesgo de descarrilamiento de trenes en la estación Pantitlán, de la Línea 9, ante a hundimientos en la zona.\nEl sindicato argumentó que, en reiteradas ocasiones, alertaron sobre esta situación pero no tuvieron respuesta por parte de las autoridades, lo que ponía en peligro a miles de usuarios que transitan a diario en el tramo Pantitlán-Velódromo.\nDurante 2024, el sindicato colocó en al menos tres ocasiones pancartas en vagones, estaciones y torniquetes para pedir al gobierno capitalino y al director del Metro atender sus demandas de aumento salarial y mejoras en prestaciones.\nPublicidad Newsletter function GetReferrerDomainX() { var preUrl = document.referrer; //console.log(\"GetReferrerDomainX",
