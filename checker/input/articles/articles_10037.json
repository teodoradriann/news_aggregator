    "title": "El papa Francisco dijo que la guerra en Ucrania es un \"acontecimiento vergonzoso para toda la humanidad\" - Infobae",
    "text": "El papa Francisco describió la guerra en Ucrania como un “acontecimiento doloroso y vergonzoso para toda la humanidad” El papa Francisco , actualmente hospitalizado en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma debido a una neumonía bilateral, emitió un mensaje de gran alcance este domingo, en el que calificó la guerra en Ucrania como un “acontecimiento doloroso y vergonzoso para toda la humanidad” .\nEste mensaje, originalmente previsto para el rezo del ángelus, fue difundido por el Vaticano en un contexto en el que el pontífice no pudo celebrarlo debido a su necesidad de descanso y tratamiento médico.\nEl papa recordó que el lunes se cumplirá el tercer aniversario del inicio de la invasión rusa a Ucrania, un conflicto que sigue causando dolor en la región y que, según Francisco, afecta de manera profunda a la humanidad.\n“ Mañana se cumple el tercer aniversario de la guerra a gran escala contra Ucrania: ¡un acontecimiento doloroso y vergonzoso para toda la humanidad!” , expresó el pontífice. En su mensaje, el papa reiteró su cercanía con el pueblo ucraniano, que ha sufrido durante más de dos años los devastadores efectos del conflicto.\nA pesar de su condición médica, Francisco no dejó de manifestar su solidaridad con otros pueblos afectados por la violencia. En su mensaje, pidió oraciones por las víctimas de todos los conflictos armados y recordó a los países que siguen enfrentando graves crisis bélicas. “Los invito a recordar a las víctimas de todos los conflictos armados y a rezar por el don de la paz en Palestina, en Israel y en todo Oriente Medio, en Myanmar, en Kivu y en Sudán” , añadió.\nEl papa Francisco estrecha la mano del presidente ucraniano Volodímir Zelenski, en el Vaticano, el 13 de mayo de 2023 (Vatican Media/REUTERS/Archivo) El mensaje del papa, difundido en formato escrito, se ofreció en lugar de la tradicional oración del ángelus, como ocurrió el domingo pasado, para que el pontífice pudiera descansar debido a su estado de salud. Esta decisión fue tomada para garantizar su recuperación y cumplir con los tratamientos necesarios mientras permanece en el hospital.\nEn su comunicado, el papa Francisco también informó sobre su estado de salud, asegurando que “continúa con confianza” su tratamiento en el hospital , destacando la importancia del descanso como parte de su proceso de recuperación. “El descanso también forma parte de la terapia” , subrayó el pontífice.\nAgradecido por el apoyo recibido, Francisco expresó su profunda gratitud hacia los médicos y el personal sanitario del hospital Gemelli. “Agradezco de corazón a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me están demostrando y por la dedicación con la que realizan su servicio entre las personas enfermas”, afirmó.\nEl papa, quien fue ingresado en el hospital el 14 de febrero tras sufrir una neumonía bilateral, pasó una noche tranquila y descansó, tras haber enfrentado una crisis respiratoria este sábado, lo que requirió la administración de oxígeno y transfusiones de sangre debido a una anemia. Sin embargo, su estado sigue siendo estable , según informaron las autoridades vaticanas.\nEl papa Francisco se encuentra hospitalizado en la clínica Gemelli, en Roma (Vatican News) En el mensaje, el pontífice también destacó el impacto que han tenido en él los numerosos mensajes de apoyo y oraciones que ha recibido desde todo el mundo, especialmente las cartas y dibujos de niños. “ En estos días me han llegado muchos mensajes de afecto y me han impresionado especialmente las cartas y dibujos de los niños . ¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de confortación que he recibido de todo el mundo!”, expresó.\nPor su parte, el cardenal vicario de Roma, Baldo Reina , celebrará esta tarde en la basílica de San Juan de Letrán una misa especial en la que se pedirá por la salud del papa Francisco. En la misa, se orará para que el Señor lo sostenga “con su gracia” y le brinde la fuerza necesaria para superar esta prueba.\n(Con información de EFE)",

    "text": "Welcome to the dog days of summer.\nThese so-called Dog Days mark the climatologically hottest period of the season, which lasts through Aug. 21 . That’s right — there’s more sweatiness on the way. But no worries, we’ve got guides to feel fresh and stay safe in the heat so we can still have fun outdoors all season long.\nAdvertisement To cool off and unwind, Jason takes us to the only lake in Pennsylvania where you can escape to live the tranquil houseboat life .\nBut first, we’re exploring the Pine Barrens, a dreamscape of recreation and a beacon of preservation in our region .\n☀️ Your weekend weather outlook: Sunny days ahead with a slight reprieve from the oppressive heat. Stay hydrated and apply sunscreen.\n— Paola Pérez ( outdoorsy@inquirer.com )\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here .\nNew Jersey’s own Middle Earth Enter the Pine Barrens, a vast open space spread across South Jersey with so much to soak up.\nThe Pine Barrens extend as far north as Plumsted, and as far south as mid- Cape May County. The Garden State Parkway forms its eastern border, and parts of four municipalities form its western front, including parts of Mount Holly and Medford.\nIt’s a forestland, safe from suburban sprawl, with access to hiking trails, kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and lookout spots with stellar views.\nAnd good food. We can’t forget the food. (Fun fact: Anthony Bourdain visited a diner here in 2015!)\nBefore you go, there’s a few things you should know:\n📱 Cell reception may be spotty , so grab a physical map in case your coverage stops you in your tracks\n🐛 Bugs are a problem , especially ticks, biting flies, and mosquitoes, so don’t forget to pack anti-bug sprays and wear appropriate clothing.\n🚗 Be careful driving , because some dirt roads may be not be as reasonably maintained as paved ones. Also, avoid going through puddles if you are unsure about their depth.\n🏠 Remember the “Pineys,” the people who live there. This landscape, while it is more or less nature’s theme park, is home to proud locals.\nReady? Let us show you exactly where to start your journey through the Pine Barrens .\nTranquility on the lake 🎤 Now we’re passing the microphone to Jason Nark. You’ll always find his work here.\nIn the Deep South, in places far from the surf, “lake life” is a big deal, and boating is more than a hobby.\nThere’s a slew of country songs about the lifestyle, too, tunes about specific rivers where it gets hotter than a “hoochie coochie,” as described in Alan Jackson’s “Chattahoochee,” and others about particular boats like the pontoon. There’s even a Merle Haggard song about houseboats, which are like pontoons with small houses on them, an aquatic RV more or less.\nJeremy Hetrick, a South Carolina native, knows all about lake life, but mostly because he’s the administrative assistant at Seven Points Marina on Raystown Lake, the largest lake entirely within Pennsylvania (the state has 77 miles of Lake Erie shoreline). Raystown, created by a hydroelectric dam process in 1973, is a whopping 8,300 acres. The lake is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and, unlike other large bodies of water in Pennsylvania, like Lake Wallenpaupack and Harveys and Conneaut Lakes, Raystown has undergone almost no development.\nThere’s not a single house on its 118 miles of shoreline, but there’s a ton of houseboats, like the eight-person model Hetrick is about to board on the marina’s long network of docks. — Jason Nark\nGo deeper into the lake’s houseboat culture — and what you can expect if you rent one .\nNews worth knowing Heads up, Mile Trail frequenters, part of the popular paved trail is closed while officials investigate a possible chemical contamination at a site near Bartram’s Garden .\nThe Philadelphia Youth Regatta, the largest one-day sprint regatta in the world, takes over the Schuylkill River this weekend with more than 700 races scheduled .\nYogis who baked Yoga on the Banks into their routines over the last decade must now abruptly say goodbye to the beloved outdoor workout class on Sunday .\nA microbiologist explains how to avoid getting sick when gangs of germs are lurking in the woods, in the soil, in the water, and in your food, ready to rain on your summer parade .\nCatch a flick al fresco (for free!) with the help of our guide to watch outdoor movies in Philly all summer long .\n10 seconds of calm 🎤 Jason says: This is in Hammersley Wild Area in Western Pennsylvania.\nSo soothing.\nYour outdoorsy experience Mike Schultheis of Royersford, Montgomery County , shared this delightful image and story with us:\nMy wife and I used to disappear for our annual fall getaway, staying at Cherry Mills Lodge in Dushore in October. Alas it was bought, changed and now closed but was a great, well run laid back B&B where the Little Loyalsock Creek splashing below our window sent you off to a most peaceful sleep. The trip also included well deserved respite at Eagles Mere Inn’s, A.C. Little’s Drinkery for great food and camaraderie after a day of traipsing around Ricketts Glen, feeding Kahlo and Valerie at Artisan Alpacas, drinking in the sunset from High Knob and finding fossils in Loyalsock Creek. Then in 2019, there was Cold Run “road” to the canyon vista. Barely a car wide with a shear cliff on one side that I will forever be grateful to our Subaru “Forrest” for getting us up top and for no car coming the other way. Even though the leaves were past peak this view made it so worthwhile. Our world then breathed relief and put an end to any worries. I think we sat and stared for almost an hour of calm. Also think we should go back. What’s a little terror if the end justifies the journey? Hmmm…\nMy thoughts exactly.\n📮 Give us a review of your outdoors experience for a chance to be featured in this newsletter by emailing me back .\n👋🏽 I hope you get a moment to bask in the glory of nature very soon.

    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "title": "For Colts' defensive line, record-setting sacks are key to wins – but not the group's focus",
    "text": "A year ago, the Colts' defensive line was chasing the wrong thing. The Colts had 43 sacks with two games left, four shy of setting an Indianapolis-era franchise record. The defensive line was chasing the record, not the process that would get them the record. And there were too many selfish rushes and not enough of a collective pass rush. Over the final two games of 2022, the Colts had one sack. In 2023, defensive line coach Nate Ollie doubled down on his core message, one that's resonated with a defensive line that got its record-setting 47th sack last week against the Atlanta Falcons. \"We really talk about chasing God and putting God first,\" Ollie said. \"And if we do that and chase him, everything else will fall into place.\" Through a commitment to unselfish, four-as-one pass rushes, the Colts' defense has one of the most impactful fronts in the NFL. Three players have eight or more sacks (Kwity Paye, Dayo Odeyingbo, Samson Ebukam), and 14 different players have at least a half-sack. The Colts are 7-0 when generating four or more sacks this season, and the impact of the sacks in those games has been significant. Of the 33 possessions in those seven wins on which the Colts have had at least one sack, those drives have ended like this: |Drive end event||Count| |Punt||17| |Field goal makes/attempts||5/7| |Turnovers||5| |End of half/game||2| |Turnover on downs||1| |Touchdowns||1| In those seven games with four or more sacks, the Colts allowed their opponents to score on 27.1 percent of their possessions, underscoring the cumulative impact of getting opposing quarterbacks to the ground so frequently. \"You can kind of feel when you're winning early, you got the O-line on their heels, they're more susceptible to more moves because they're kind of playing on there heels, they're focused on what they got beat on earlier,\" Odeyingbo said. \"So it kind of sets up other moves.\" Another aspect to why the Colts' defense has made such a major impact through sacks is the depth with which they're able to play. Ollie is constantly rotating his \"alpha\" and \"bravo\" groups, subbing four guys on and off like an NHL line change. And through the play of linemen like Tyquan Lewis and Jake Martin, the Colts haven't had a significant dropoff when Ebukam, Paye, DeForest Buckner, etc. come off the field. \"We take pride in not having a weak link,\" Ollie said. \"And that's when you can roll as a group, you can go out there and you could go four guys on and four guys off like hockey subs. If you can do that, any front you're on, you got a good group of guys.\" While these sacks have come in bunches, they haven't come in every game this season. The Colts are 1-7 when getting three or fewer sacks, with that lone win coming in a one-sack Week 5 over the Tennessee Titans. Opponents are scoring on 49 percent of their possessions in those eight games. The difference, defensive coordinator Gus Bradley said, is the Colts generally haven't been able to contain opposition running backs in those seven defeats. \"Looking back at the last couple games where we didn't play well, the backs have come alive against us,\" Bradley said. \"Cincinnati, it was the screen game. This past game, (Bijan) Robinson did a good job – both backs did a good job against us. We gave up some explosive plays whether it was them catching balls on passes, screen game, or on some of the runs. I think that's a common thread right now that we have to take care of – is slowing down these running back type plays that are getting yards against us.\" In those seven games with four-plus sacks, the Colts are holding opposing running backs to 4.7 yards per touch; in their other eight games running backs are averaging 5.8 yards per touch (the NFL average is 5.2 yards per touch allowed to running backs). \"That's the only way to eventually rush the passer is stopping the run first, getting them behind the chains, forcing them to call riskier plays and try to call longer-developing plays down the field,\" Odeyingbo said. \"So that kind of opens up opportunities for sacks.\" Ollie doesn't focus on sacks with his defensive line, though. The thing he's more interested in is the defensive line's effort board, which tracks \"special efforts\" – like a defensive lineman running downfield to make a tackle. The Colts have more of those high-effort plays than they do sacks. But the sacks also won't come without the commitment to those high-effort plays. And they'll need both to win their way into the playoffs over the season's final two weeks. \"That's more a testament of the group than the sacks, just the effort that those guys play with each and every day,\" Ollie said. \"In order to do that, you gotta be able to sub four guys in, four guys off and not missing a beat.\"",

Sin eso es imposible dar ese paso\", ha dicho Putin cuando se le ha preguntado por la ausencia de Venezuela en el grupo de doce países que han sido este jueves incluidos como Estados socio, como paso previo a su inclusión definitiva. \"Nuestras posiciones no coinciden con las de [Brasil] la cuestión de Venezuela. Lo digo abiertamente\", ha reconocido el presidente ruso, quien ha respaldo la victoria de su par venezolano, [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/internacionales/apuntalado-brics-putin-quiere-afianzarse-frente-occidente-20241023-731309.html), en las últimas y polémicas elecciones. En ese sentido, Putin ha expresado que confía en que las relaciones entre Brasil y Venezuela retomen su tradicional normalidad. En la víspera, los medios brasileños adelantaron que Venezuela y Nicaragua se quedaban fuera, a petición de Brasil, de una lista finalmente formada por doce países que pasarían a ser catalogados como Estados socios de los BRICS, entre ellos Bolivia, Cuba, Nigeria, Bielorrusia, Indonesia, o Vietnam. Las relaciones entre Venezuela y Brasil no pasan por su mejor momento, después de que el presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, si bien sin ser tan explícitos como otros líderes de la región, ha reprochado a [Maduro](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/internacionales/brics-piden-guerra-y-mas-financiacion-entregan-detalles-20241023-731198.html) que no haya todavía presentado pruebas de su triunfo en las elecciones.",

    "title": "Opinion | Ed Markey on climate change: Don’t cede future to China",
    "text": "As someone increasingly pessimistic about the world’s ability to mount the carbon dioxide-curbing effort necessary to stave off the worst impacts of global warming, I’m always heartened to talk to Senator Ed Markey, a relentlessly upbeat leader in the climate struggle.\nBut before we turn to Mr. Optimistic, let’s have a little gloom and doom. Long predicted, the dangerous effects of climate change have arrived in an unmistakable (and what would in a more rational nation be an undeniable) way. Much of the country now swelters under dangerous heat waves during summer. In mid-July, regions with upward of 135 million Americans were under heat alerts.\nAround the world, previous high-temperature records have toppled like candlepins in a bowling tournament. Heat-related causes killed more than 47,000 Europeans in 2023, according to a new study. Deaths from heat hit 2,300 in this country in 2023, up 34 percent from the previous year.\nDepressed? Well, here’s Markey with some good news as this country marks the second anniversary of the incentive-based climate law known as the Inflation Reduction Act.\nAdvertisement\n“This year, there is going to be 36,000 new megawatts of solar [electricity] installed in the United States, and 8,000 new megawatts of wind installed in the United States,” Markey said during a phone conversation. (Nationally, solar power is projected to be 58 percent of the total new electrical capacity added this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. ) Markey’s office estimates that when that new solar and wind power is fully available, it will meet the electricity needs of more than 9 million households.\nThe IRA has now leveraged some $370 billion in private-sector investments, which accounts for the creation of some 335,000 clean energy jobs, the senator said, citing Climate Power.\nIndeed, renewable energy, and particularly solar, has taken strong enough root in red and purple states to begin to change the perspective of a GOP whose fossil fuel funding had long made it resistant to most things green. Last week, 18 House Republicans wrote to Speaker Mike Johnson opposing repeal of the energy tax credits in the IRA.\nAdvertisement\n“Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country — including many districts represented by members of our conference,” they declared.\nBut that is unlikely to deter Donald Trump’s aversion to renewable energy should he retake the White House.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has vowed to target “all new spending grants and giveaways under the Joe Biden mammoth socialist bills like the so-called Inflation Reduction Act,” adding that “we’re going to save all that money.” According to The Washington Post, during an April fund-raiser with oil-industry executives, Trump promised to end much of the Biden administration’s green-energy agenda, taking particular aim at wind-generated energy and electric vehicles, and promising to bolster the fossil fuel industry. He then asked the petroleum panjandrums to raise $1 billion for his comeback effort.\nA man who considers climate change a hoax, Trump has adopted Sarah Palin’s energy slogan: Drill, baby, drill. He would again take the United States out of the Paris c limate agreement, which sets voluntary targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, keyed to a country’s level of development, capabilities, and emissions history. The United States, the largest emitter over time, has a more stringent voluntary-reductions schedule than do China and India. That gives conservatives agita, but it’s better to have a voluntary agreement with differentiated national targets than no agreement at all — at least for those who acknowledge the threat of human-caused global warming.\nFor his part, Markey offers a seize-the-future economic argument for the IRA’s tax credits, deductions, grants, and loans : With China trying to dominate the solar and wind energy, electric vehicle, and battery sectors, the IRA has given US producers a vital boost to help them compete.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Après la bordée de neige tant attendue, les skieurs manitobains renouent avec leur sport Après une longue attente, la saison de ski de fond est officiellement lancée dans le sud du Manitoba. Photo : Radio-Canada Les fondeurs manitobains étaient tout sourire sur les pistes, vendredi, à l’ouverture des sentiers, après avoir longtemps attendu une bonne bordée de neige. Cela a notamment été le cas au parc Assiniboine et au parc Windsor, dans le quartier de Saint-Vital, à Winnipeg, où les sentiers ont pu accueillir leurs premiers amateurs de ski de fond, après la bordée de neige tombée entre mercredi soir et jeudi soir. Selon Environnement Canada, une vingtaine de centimètres ont été enregistrés. Le temps doux et l’absence de grandes quantités de neige ont marqué l’hiver dans le sud du Manitoba jusque-là. D’habitude, on peut commencer à skier vers la fin novembre ou début décembre. Ç’a été une longue attente, raconte Calvin Wiebe. J’étais excité en voyant la neige hier [jeudi]. L’an dernier, j’ai skié 30 fois, mais cette année on n’avait pas eu la chance de skier. À lire aussi : C’est l’ouverture la plus tardive pour ce centre de ski fréquenté par les fondeurs depuis les années 70. Nous ne sommes pas malheureux de ce fait. On a de la belle neige et on peut accueillir des skieurs, affirme le gestionnaire du Centre Nordic au parc Windsor, Laurie Penton. Quand je regardais les prévisions, on annonçait de la pluie et, finalement, ç’a été de la neige. Ce fut une belle surprise. M. Penton affirme que les skieurs avaient hâte de chausser leurs skis. Il affirme avoir été surpris d'avoir accueilli un flux constant de clients, alors qu’il croyait que la température basse allait ralentir leurs ardeurs. Le thermomètre affichait -20 °C, vendredi après-midi, à Winnipeg, avec un refroidissement éolien de -31. Malgré la première chute de neige, Laurie Penton espère qu'il y aura d’autres précipitations de neige alors que, dans certains secteurs, il n’y en a pas assez pour établir correctement un sentier. Il estime que 70 % du réseau skiable est ouvert au parc Windsor. Il se réjouit toutefois que des précipitations de neige soient prévues au cours de la semaine. Derek Page, un des skieurs, a apprécié l’état des pistes durant sa sortie vendredi. Je reviens d’un petit 5 kilomètres, affirme-t-il. J’ai préparé la cire ce matin, il fait beau, même si c’est un peu froid. Les pistes étaient très belles. Avec les informations de Richard Sabeh",

    "title": "Rusia avanza sin freno hacia Pokrovsk, nudo logístico clave de Ucrania en el frente de Donestk",
    "text": "Ucrania avanza en Kursk. Ucrania bombardea Crimea. Ucrania intenta irrupmpir en la región de Bryansk. Y sin embargo, sin que nadie le preste demasiada atención, Rusia sigue avanzando en Donestk, donde, probablemente, ha hecho los mayores progresos de los últimos meses. Analistas militares ucranianos creen en cualquier caso que el ritmo del avance enemigo pronto se ralentizará.\nEl Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia ha anunciado en su parte de guerra diario la toma de la localidad ucraniana de Mezhove como parte de su avance hacia el nudo logístico de Pokrovsk. Un avance nimio pero fundamental, en tanto que esa localidad con poco más de mil habitantes, antes del comienzo de la guerra, está a unos 24 kilómetros de Pokrovsk, un objetivo codiciado por las fuerzas rusas, ya que su toma afectaría la logística del Ejército ucraniano en esta región.\nSegún Defensa, la agrupación militar Tsentr enfrentó en este sector las fuerzas de siete brigadas ucranianas de infantería, motorizadas, aerotransportadas y defensa territorial y repelió cinco contraataques ucranianos, ocasionando unas 640 bajas.\nLa víspera, el Ejército ruso anunció la toma de la localidad de Zhelanne, en este mismo sector.\nLa intensidad de los asaltos rusos en la zona no ha decrecido desde el inicio de la operación ucraniana en Kursk, dijo a EFE este jueves Iván Siékach , portavoz de la 110ª Brigada Mecanizada del Ejército ucraniano. Las localidades de Zavitne, Komishivka y Novozhelanne también han sido tomadas por los rusos en un intento de asegurar sus flancos a lo largo del eje de su avance hacia Pokrovsk.\nSin embargo es posible que los avances de Moscú se ralenticen pronto debido a la necesidad de evitar los contraataques ucranianos contra el flanco izquierdo y gracias al terreno más elevado que ocupan las posiciones ucranianas más cercanas a Pokrovsk, escribe el coronel en la reserva y analista militar Kostiantín Mashovéts .\nVoluntarios evacuan a la población civil de Pokrovsk ante el avance de las tropas rusas. Reuters\nEn un análisis para Resistencia Informativa , Mashovéts admite que quizá las fuerzas ucranianas, numéricamente inferiores, no sean capaces de detener la presión rusa durante mucho tiempo a lo largo de las posiciones más favorables entre Selidove al sur y Yelisavetivka al norte. De hecho, las unidades de avanzada rusas ya han penetrado esta barrera potencial en Krasni Yar y Novogrodivka.\nDebido al uso prácticamente irrestricto de bombas aéreas, Rusia puede destruir incluso las posiciones defensivas más fuertes y \"evaporar\" a quienes las defienden, señala Siékach. Aunque, las fuerzas rusas tendrán que reagruparse y bajar el ritmo ante la amenaza de un contraataque desde Selidove, asegura Mashovéts.\nOtros asaltos repelidos Aunque las tropas rusas han logrado limitados progresos cerca de Chásiv Yar y de Toretsk, en otros lugares los asaltos rusos han sido repelidos de forma consistente. Así una columna de 13 tanques y vehículos acorazados fue destruida cerca de Kurajove el pasado miércoles.\nEl uso de equipamiento pesado por las fuerzas rusas es cada vez menos frecuente, debido a las pérdidas que ha sufrido en su ofensiva en Donetsk.\nAunque las bajas de personal rusas ocasionadas por la 110ª Brigada han aumentado en aproximadamente un tercio desde octubre de 2023, sus pérdidas de material han caído a un cuarto del valor original.\nDefensa de Bryansk A unos 1.000 kilómetros al noroeste de Pokrovsk, en la frontera con Rusia al norte de Kiev, efectivos del Servicio Federal de Seguridad (FSB) ruso y de las Fuerzas Armadas repelieron un intento de incursión de un grupo armado ucraniano en la región fronteriza de Briansk, vecina a la de Kursk, según informó el gobernador local, Alexandr Bogomaz .\nEl exdiputado opositor ucraniano refugiado en Rusia, Oleg Tsariov , añadió en Telegram que el incidente tuvo lugar en las cercanías de la localidad de Zabrama sobre las 19.10 hora de Moscú (14.10 GMT), cuando las fuerzas ucranianas intentaron avanzar con apoyo de tres blindados, pero retrocedieron tras media hora de combates.\nUna hora después, las fuerzas ucranianas volvieron a atacar, pero fueron igualmente repelidos. \"En total, según fuentes locales, había unos 200 efectivos del Ejército ucraniano\", señaló Tsariov.",
