    "title": "Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens limping into AFC Week 17 battle, but Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle not expected to play",
    "text": "Sunday’s AFC showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins might come down to which team is the healthiest. If that’s the case, the Dolphins are playing from behind already. The health concerns begin for both teams at the receiver position, as the No. 2 seed Miami Dolphins (11-4) prepare to play the No. 1 Baltimore Ravens (12-3) on Sunday in Baltimore. Miami’s Jaylen Waddle (ankle) and Baltimore’s Zay Flowers (calf) did not practice for the second straight day Thursday . According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Waddle is not expected to play Sunday . While one report said Waddle’s injury isn’t “overly severe ,” he was seen leaving the locker room Wednesday in a walking boot. Meanwhile, Flowers was also wearing short walking boot Wednesday after getting injured in the Ravens’ 33-19 victory over San Francisco, a game in which the rookie receiver caught nine passes for 72 yards and one touchdown. Other than Flowers, safety Kyle Hamilton, who had two interceptions against the 49ers, has been limited in practice this week while nursing a re-aggravated MCL sprain. Related: NFL power rankings: Evaluating all 32 teams after 16 games The Miami Dolphins’ significant injuries extend beyond Waddle, who surpassed the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the third time in three seasons and has been critical to the Dolphins’ No. 1 rated passing attack while star receiver Tyreek Hill has dealt with a recent ankle injury. Like Waddle, Mostert (knee/ankle) didn’t practice Wednesday or Thursday, but he is expected to suit up and play Sunday . The 31-year-old back, tied with the 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey for the NFL lead in touchdowns (21), has dealt with injuries all season and has played in all 15 games during a career-best year, which includes 1,012 yards rushing. At the same time, Hill, running back De’Von Achane (toe) and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were limited participants in practice Thursday. Given the length of each team’s injury list, Sunday’s game could be a war of attrition as the two teams battle for supremacy in the AFC. The Ravens will clinch the No. 1 seed with a victory, while the Dolphins, who still have a 24-percent chance of getting the No. 1 seed, will secure the AFC East title with a win. More must-reads:",

    "text": "Home Business Broadband Broadband News Politics Alabama receives federal approval to deploy $1.4 billion broadband expansion plan By Grayson Everett October 17, 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Email (monsitj/iStock, YHN) Alabama’s $1.4 billion proposal to expand high-speed internet has been approved by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) proudly reported on Thursday.\nThe funding, which comes through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, or BEAD, was initially announced in 2023. As part of the federal requirements, Alabama and the other states submitted proposals for deploying the BEAD funds to connect communities across Alabama with reliable high-speed internet access\nSince 2018, the state has invested more than $500 million in broadband infrastructure projects. Once completed, the over 200 projects are expected to connect an estimated 140,000 households, businesses, and community anchor institutions like schools and libraries.\nWith approval of the plan, ADECA says the state will begin launching the next phase. Alabama will open a process in 2025 to receive applications from internet service providers for projects targeting unserved households and businesses across all 67 counties. The funds will focus on “last-mile” projects that connect homes and businesses to service.\n“From the beginning, my goal to expand access to high-speed internet to every area of Alabama has been a team effort, and our plan to utilize these substantial BEAD funds to close the gap in broadband coverage is no different,” Governor Kay Ivey said.\n“ADECA, lawmakers, local leaders, and internet service providers each play a valuable role to ensure all of Alabama is connected. I commend all our partners in the approval of the plan and look forward to rolling out this funding in 2025.”\nRELATED: Be Linked Alabama: Interactive map lights up broadband growth\nADECA’s Alabama Digital Expansion Division is also managing funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and through the Alabama Broadband Accessibility Fund.\n“High-speed broadband internet access is key to the success of students, families, small businesses, and industries across our nation. With continued state-federal and public-private partnerships making strategic investments in closing the digital divide, more Alabamians will have the opportunity to achieve their American Dream,” U.S. Senator Katie Britt said.\n“I appreciate the leadership of Governor Ivey and ADECA in advancing this tailored plan for our state. I’ve always said we need to put Alabama first, and Governor Ivey is doing just that. I look forward to seeing how increased connectivity elevates our state and our communities long into the future.”\nThe funds are focused on permanent fiber infrastructure, for which the federal BEAD program prioritizes funding. Alabama’s broadband expansion strategy has also prioritized fiber-optic networks to ensure the infrastructure not only meets current needs, but also serves communities well into the future.\nGrayson Everett is the state and political editor for Yellowhammer News.

    "title": "Outreach by PM Narendra Modi to Russian President Putin helped prevent first nuclear attack since Hiroshima and Nagasaki: What a CNN report says",
    "text": "As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started “preparing rigorously” for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials. The report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN.\n“One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” the senior administration official said.\nUS officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n“I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,” CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying.\n“I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the senior administration official added. “I can’t demonstrate this positively, but I think that’s our assessment.”\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\nIn a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that “this is not the era of war” on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement was even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place “in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,” the senior administration official said.\nNotably, late summer 2022 was also proving a ‘devastating period’ for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia’s biggest prize since the invasion.\nAs these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a “potential trigger” for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN.\nAlso, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new “false flag story” about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\nIn October 2022, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was “concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.”\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported.\n“We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.”\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Elige un diseño de estética boho, con olanes y en tejido transparente, la marca de lujo complementó con un enterizo estampado y un abrigo clásico con hombros XL, el look infalible para lucir elegante y única en cada paso que des. Otra de la propuesta de Etro es aprovechar el color estridente del calzado para darle un giro atractivo a los estilismos en clave monocromática, tal como lo vemos en la fotografía. Sigue el consejo de estilo y lleva mules rosas de tacón con un vestido midi transparente con olanes sobre un enterizo con estampado bohemio y un blazer oversize con hombros XL. Una opción distintiva, moderna y con un toque original para hacer voltear dos veces las cabezas en la ciudad. ¿Zapatos naranjas para Otoño-Invierno 2024? Por supuesto que sí. Estos serán clave para construir estilismos de bloques de color que tanto encantan a pasarelas y street style, solo es cuestión de atreverte. Empareja el calzado estrella con una falda de mezclilla sobre un vestido midi en color café, junto con un blazer cropped y medias gruesas acanaladas. Algo que podríamos ver en el street style de Copenhague e incluso Sydney. Nada más acertado que apostar por zapatos de tacón en tonos marrones que encajan con la paleta de color del otoño. Llévalos de manera elegante en un estilismo compuesto por una falda midi con patrón boho, blusa de escote en V, un abrigo XL a juego y calcetas gruesas, la idea es crear un atuendo en tonos cafés que se adaptan a los códigos de estilo de la estación. Perfecto para transformar tu estilo de oficina, o bien, para impresionar en una reunión social. Si alguna vez pensaste que los zapatos de tacón en colores estridentes no son elegantes, deja que Etro demuestre lo contrario. La firma italiana confirmó que un par de mules en naranja mandarina son lo suficientemente distintivos y versátiles para lucir con faldas largas con un toque seductor. Opta por una pieza larga en tejido transparente, de efecto drapeado y abertura lateral, el resto quedará en complementar con una camisa a juego y una chaqueta cropped boho de terciopelo. Distintivo y atractivo, todo lo que requieres para brillar en la ciudad.",
