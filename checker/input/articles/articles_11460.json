    "title": "Venezuela to hold military exercises as British warship heads to Guyana | Hackney Gazette",
    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "text": "TV-Ikone offenbart „harte Zeit“: Sie duschte im Hallenbad\nSie steht für Erfolg und für starke Frauen im TV – aber das war nicht immer so. Diese Moderatorin hat auch dunkle Tage erlebt.\nMallorca – Eine Wohnung in Köln, einen Zweitwohnsitz auf Mallorca und seit kurzem auch noch ein Apartment in München. Birgit Schrowange (67) weiß das Leben in vollen Zügen zu genießen und liebt den Lifestyle, den sie sich jetzt leisten kann. Denn es ist kein geerbtes Geld, was dahintersteckt. Jeder Euro ist selbst verdient.\nIhre Eltern glaubten nicht an Birgit Schrowanges Traum\nIm „Bild“-Interview spricht Birgit Schrowange über ihren Karriereanfang und die Hürden, die ihr in den Weg gelegt wurden. Ihre Eltern hätten sie in ihrem Traum, Fernsehansagerin zu werden, nie unterstützt, erinnert sich die gebürtige Sauerländerin. Ihnen zuliebe besuchte sie eine Mädchen-Realschule und machte anschließend eine Ausbildung zur Rechtsanwalts- und Notargehilfin.\nHeimlich bewarb Birgit Schrowange sich 1977 als Sekretärin beim WDR. „Ich war mir sicher, sobald ich einen Fuß im Sender habe, dann schaffe ich es auch vor die Kamera“, erklärt sie im Interview diesen selbstbewussten Karriereschritt. Und der Plan ging auf. Ihr Chef sah Potenzial in ihr und unterstützte die Quereinsteigerin.\nEin winziges Zimmer ohne eigenes Bad war Birgit Schrowanges Zuhause\nDoch für Birgit Schrowange war es eine harte Zeit. Sie verdiente nicht gut und steckte fast ihr ganzes Gehalt in die Sprechausbildung. „Ich wohnte auf zwölf Quadratmetern“, erinnert sich die TV-Moderatorin. „Die Toilette war eine Etage tiefer, die Dusche im Keller. Wegen der vielen Obdachlosen ging ich ins Hallenbad, um zu duschen.“ Wenn sie heute an die Anfangsjahre zurückdenke, sieht der Fernsehstar trotzdem nur die guten Seiten: „Die Zeiten waren hart, ich hatte wenig Geld. Aber ich war total happy. Ich war frei und ich hatte ein Ziel vor Augen. Ich fühlte mich grenzenlos.“\nAuch die teils abschätzigen Bewertungen durch männliche Kollegen und Vorgesetzte konnten Birgit Schrowange von ihrem Traum nie abbringen. Klar sei für sie anfangs eine Welt zusammengebrochen, gab sie in einem Interview mit dem Portal wunderweib.de zu, doch sie habe gelernt darüber zu stehen. Irgendwann habe sie gemerkt, dass alle nur mit Wasser kochen. „Ab diesem Moment“, sagt sie im Interview, „weißt du: Dir kann nichts passieren.“ Zu diesem ungewöhnlichen Schritt griff ihr Chef kurz vor Birgit Schrowanges Sendung.

    "title": "Did Tim Walz 'let Minneapolis burn' in 2020? Here's what happened.",
    "text": "Tim Walz joining the Democratic Party’s presidential ticket has prompted renewed scrutiny of how the Minnesota governor handled the protests following George Floyd's death. Opponents of the pick by Vice President Kamala Harris wasted no time bringing up the demonstrations that began in Walz’s state and grew increasingly violent during the week that followed Floyd’s killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Four years later, the images of Minneapolis in May 2020 remain striking. Flames bursting from the city’s 3rd Precinct police headquarters and raging inside a looted AutoZone store. A protester illuminated by fire carrying an upside-down U.S. flag , a sign of distress, down a burning street. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page Those snapshots were referenced in a post on X, formerly Twitter, by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said Walz “ sat by and let Minneapolis burn .” Similarly, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan posted that Walz “ let rioters and looters burn a police station to the ground in 20 20 ,\" and Minnesota Republican Party chair David Hann said Walz “did nothing ” to stop the riots. Follow-up interviews with these critics showed a focus on how and when Walz activated the National Guard, an authority reserved for the governor of each state. In an email to USA TODAY, Hann said Walz \"waited three days before activating the National Guard\" and claimed the governor was reluctant to oppose Democrats' characterization of the protests as peaceful. Jordan spokesperson Russell Dye referenced a New York Post article detailing an October 2020 report from a Republican-controlled Minnesota Senate committee that states Walz \"failed to act\" during the riots and specifically criticized the speed of the National Guard deployment. USA TODAY reached out to spokespeople for DeSantis and for Walz's gubernatorial office and the Harris-Walz campaign but did not immediately receive responses. Let’s look back at the chain of events during that tumultuous week in May 2020. Fact check: Gov. Walz does not need to resign after VP selection More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page Protests began after video of Floyd death went viral It started on May 25, 2020 – Memorial Day, a Monday – when the Minneapolis Police Department received a call that someone spent a possible counterfeit $20 bill on cigarettes at a convenience store. Responding officers came across a 46-year-old Black man, later identified as Floyd, and handcuffed him. He was placed on the ground, and Officer Derek Chauvin proceeded to hold his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes while ignoring Floyd's protests that he couldn't breathe. Floyd was declared dead shortly thereafter. A bystander shared a video of his killing on social media – sparking the first of the protests . “By the time we get to Tuesday, we’re already seeing some emergent conflicts between protesters and the police, but they’re relatively small-scale,” said Michelle Phelps , a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of a book about policing in Minneapolis that examines the protests. But by that Wednesday, things changed. The demonstrations became more violent, with officers firing noise devices and projectiles toward crowds of protesters and fires breaking out at the AutoZone and other locations. “Wednesday is when things really started picking up,” said Rachel Moran , an associate professor of law at St. Thomas University and an expert on police accountability. “And then Thursday morning, he calls in the National Guard. … It actually happened relatively quickly. It was just, the protests were massive, and Wednesday … I think that’s when everyone in Minneapolis, they’re realizing, ‘OK, this is going to be bigger than what we’ve seen.’” That prompted Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, to call Walz and discuss activating National Guard troops. The governor – not then-President Donald Trump, as some have wrongly claimed – activated the Guard that Thursday. But with only 90 troops on the ground in the Twin Cities later that night , The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported, protesters set fire to the 3rd Precinct station. That led Trump to call protesters “thugs” and vow that “ when the looting starts, the shooting starts \" in an X post the following day. Walz mobilized the full Guard that Saturday – its first full mobilization since World War II – and conceded his administration underestimated the size of the crowds of protesters. By Sunday, even as protests spread across the U.S., the violence in Minneapolis had calmed. Walz activated Guard after written request, not mayor’s phone call One of the most powerful tools at a governor's disposal is the National Guard , and it's largely up to him to decide when and to what degree to use it . Experts say the rhetoric aimed at Walz's National Guard activation oversimplifies a chaotic and complicated moment. “I don’t think city officials or the governor knew exactly what to do,” Moran said. “But that’s very different than saying he stood by and let it burn. I absolutely wouldn’t agree with that.\" John Harrington, the state's public safety commissioner at the time, told MinnPost in 2023 that [officials in Minneapolis typically do not request state assistance for protests] \"because most of the time, Minneapolis handles their own business.\" So when state help became necessary, the parties involved weren't well-versed in how to make that happen. The question of who to blame for the speed of the National Guard response, then, hinges on a bit of bureaucracy: Walz couldn't activate the guard until Frey formally asked him to do so, and the two leaders disagree on when that request was made. Frey said his call to the governor that Wednesday evening qualified as a formal request and claimed Walz was \"hesitating.\" Walz countered that the mayor misunderstood the requirements of a formal request and recognized the written letter he received a day later as that request. The Guard was activated that afternoon. Harrington characterized Frey’s phone call as vague, and an outside firm that reviewed the response largely agreed . A request for Guard assistance must include specific details typically found in an operations plan or an incident action plan that the firm said in its 2022 report “we did not receive and that we determined through interviews did not exist.” In its report released three weeks before Election Day in 2020 and criticized by Democrats as the product of \" one-sided hearings ,\" the GOP-led state Senate Joint Transportation and Judiciary and Public Safety Committee blamed Walz for poor decision-making and said he wanted to \"wait for assignments \" from the city before mobilizing the Guard. The document paraphrases Harrington as saying during a hearing that officials should have been \"quicker to bring people in \" and that the state could have been more \"successful \" had it mobilized the right personnel and used the right tactics – without specifying what those should have been. \"There were a lot of imperfect attempts to figure out how to respond,\" Moran said. \"Part of the city did burn, for sure. I don't disagree with the actual results. But it wasn't a matter of people standing by.\" Additionally, increasing the police presence prematurely ran the risk of introducing a different set of problems. Moran noted, \"These were protests about the police, and so the presence of law enforcement was, in a way, antagonizing.\" Experts also said attacking Walz over the timing of the Guard's activation oversimplifies the logistical challenge of transporting them and providing them with a mission. Gen. Jon Jensen, the Guard’s former adjutant general, later testified that only 700 of the state’s 13,000 troops had riot training . “It takes a while to get all of those troops on the ground,” Phelps said. That delay was illustrated Thursday, when more than 500 soldiers were activated but reports indicated fewer than 100 troops were on the ground . That number on the ground grew to 700 on Friday and swelled to 4,500 by Saturday , as Walz activated the full Guard for the first time since WWII . More than 7,000 were on duty by Sunday as the violence eased. “To say that he let Minnesota or Minneapolis burn is just a wild misconstruing of the facts,\" Phelps said. “It was a response to a really unusual set of circumstances, and I think they responded as fast as was reasonably possible, given the scale of the operation.\" Thank you for supporting our journalism.

    "text": "Exagerar em bebidas açucaradas pode prejudicar o bem-estar mental\nEstudo brasileiro liga ingestão de refrigerante e sucos industrializados a sintomas de ansiedade e depressão\nRefrigerantes, sucos artificiais e néctares são cheios de açúcar, e o alto consumo predispõe doenças crônicas como obesidade e diabetes. Eis um fato!\nMas agora cientistas estão descortinando a associação entre essas bebidas e comprometimentos à saúde mental.\nÉ o que aponta uma análise da farmacêutica Isabela Biagio em seu mestrado pela PUC de Campinas. Ao esmiuçar dados de mais de 117 mil alunos incluídos na Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar, ela constatou que o consumo regular de refris e afins está relacionado a um aumento de 13% no risco de desenvolver sintomas de depressão e de até 33% nos de ansiedade.\n“Esses produtos ativam uma via cerebral que, em desequilíbrio, afeta a saúde mental”, resume Isabela.\n+Leia Também: Por um copo a menos de refri\nDados\n88 litros de bebidas açucaradas são consumidos por crianças brasileiras todo ano.\n62 litros desses mesmos produtos são ingeridos por adultos anualmente.\n+Leia Também: 5 pontos para entender a relação entre ultraprocessados e doenças crônicas\nNão é ruim só para a cabeça\nAbuso de bebidas lotadas de açúcar reverbera em outras instâncias\nObesidade: O excesso de açúcar e calorias pode se converter em gordura corporal, armazenada entre os órgãos. Um perigo para a saúde.\nCâncer: Estudos ligam o consumo elevado de fontes de açúcar a maior propensão a tumores no intestino e no fígado. Cautela extra!\nCompulsão: Refris e néctares são exemplos de ultraprocessados, alimentos que pedem moderação até pela sedução ao paladar.\nCáries: Não tem jeito: açúcar demais na rotina alimenta as bactérias por trás dos agravos aos dentes.
