    "text": "As children grow up surrounded by smart phones, parents are repeatedly warned about the dangers of allowing too much digital technology in their kids' lives. But phones, iPads, toys with batteries and huge immersive screens were a central part of the Festival of Digital Play, which attracted hundreds of families to the [University of Wollongong](https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/7629587/what-new-uow-students-need-to-know/)'s [Early Start Discovery Space](https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/7953803/take-a-look-at-early-start-discovery-spaces-new-outdoor-playground/) on Thursday. Director of Early Start Research Professor Lisa Kervin said many of the families who regularly attend the children's museum and play space raised the issue of digital technology as something they struggle with in their parenting. \"It's an area that is so contentious for families,\" she said. \"We know that digital technologies are in homes - our families tell us that - so we just really want to be able to give them some strategies and some ways of thinking about using digital technologies in ways that are productive and safe for children. \"We're not about shaming about screen time and all of those sorts of discourses, we just want to have that conversation. \"We really try hard to push against solitary, isolated play with digital technologies because we don't think that's a good use of digital resources at all. \"But if you're engaging with something for a real purpose, then that changes the nature of it.\" To do this, researchers set up various play experiences, showing kids and parents how technology can be used to make activities more exciting and engaging. For instance, at one pop-up in the garden area children were encouraged to make a giant bubble painting, with Early Start staff filming their creations in slow motion to show them how a bubble forms and how it looks when it pops. \"This is simple technology that most families have on their smart phones, so it's about empowering parents without a great expense to do amazing things,\" Prof Kervin said. The festival was also designed to give kids and parents new ways of using commercial digital toys they might already have at home in a way that allows for open ended play and enriching experiences. \"Families are often talking to us about 'what are good things to purchase for my child?', particularly around Christmas, and we thought it would be really great if we could give families some guidance in terms of how to incorporate these resources into some really great evidence-based quality practises,\" she said. Researchers set up a robot rally and robot obstacle course using commercially produced toys, which was designed to create open ended play experiences for the common battery powered toys. \"There's a race track that the team have created for the robots, and they have to navigate around that particular space,\" \"Sometimes we as parents, we invest in these things because we think they're going to be really great, but then the child loses interest really quickly, and then it just ends up in the cupboard and it's never touched again. \"We're showing families some ways that these resources could be used, that do the things that we want them to do - so there's open ended exploration there, with the adults really scaffolding the interaction as well. \"If adults are having fun, then children are having fun too.\" Watching her nieces Goldie and Lakey play with the robot racetrack, Evie Parrish-Gibbons said it was good for all caregivers to know how to use technology with kids. \"We live in a digital world now, kids are surrounded by ipads and phones and at school we use all sorts of different technologies,\" she said. \"At home, a lot of the time, if we don't have enough experience with technology, rather than knowing what to give the kids, they'll end up in front of YouTube or movies or a game - which has its place - but knowing that this sort of stuff exists can mean that you can use technology in a different way with your kids. \"Education is the only way to really make a difference in it.\" ",

The smaller the difference between the inside and outside temperatures, the lower your energy usage and bills. One of the easiest things customers can do for heating efficiency is to change air filters regularly. A dirty air filter makes a heating system work harder, which uses more energy and can increase costs. Also, have heating systems checked regularly by a qualified heating and air conditioning contractor to maintain efficiency and peak performance. Leave drapes or blinds open during sunny winter days to allow the sun's rays to warm the house, but close them at night to help insulate your home. One of best energy-saving habits you can do each year is to check windows, doors and vents for air leaks. Caulking, sealing and weatherstripping leaks can save 10% to 20% in heating costs. Replace standard bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED).Â LEDs are more efficient than regular bulbs, while giving off the same amount of light. Replacing just six of your most frequently used bulbs with LEDs can save up to $480 over the lifetime of the bulbs. Operate ceiling fans in a clockwise direction in the winter, which pushes warm air back down into the room. (Most fans have a switch that allows you to reverse the motor.) While fans move air and make people more comfortable, they do not provide heat, so remember to turn the fan off when you leave the room. Manage water heating. Set your water heater to 120 degrees or less. Water heating is typically the second biggest user of energy in your home.

    "title": "'Time to end the war': Biden sees progress on Gaza deal - Breitbart",
    "text": "President Joe Biden said Thursday that US mediators were making progress in reaching a Gaza ceasefire deal as he called for an end to the Israel-Hamas war. Biden, in a high-stakes, nearly hour-long news conference aimed at repudiating doubters of his reelection bid, acknowledged concerns about Israeli actions despite his overall support for the US ally. “There’s a lot of things in retrospect I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do, but the bottom line is we have a chance now. It’s time to end this war,” he said after a NATO summit in Washington. Biden acknowledged there remained “difficult, complex issues” between Israel and Hamas. “There are still gaps to close. We’re making progress,” Biden said. “The trend is positive, and I’m determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war, which should end now,” he said. Biden more than a month ago laid out a plan in which Israel would temporarily halt its offensive in Gaza and Palestinian militants would release hostages, setting the stage for talks for a permanent end to the devastating nine-month war. Hamas came back with counterproposals and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced pushback from some of his hard-right government allies. But diplomats have spoken of progress in the latest round of talks that closed Thursday in Qatar, the key mediator. Pushing Israel ‘really hard’ Biden threw his support behind Israel after the October 7 attack by Hamas which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,345 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Biden, 81, recalled his meeting a half-century ago as a young senator with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir — and acknowledged that times have changed. “We pushed it really hard, and Israel occasionally was less than cooperative,” Biden said of Netanyahu’s government. “This war cabinet is one of the most conservative war cabinets in the history of Israel, and there’s no ultimate answer other than a two-state solution here,” he said. Biden also stood firm on his decision to hold up delivery of massive 2,000-pound bombs, even as his administration moves forward on other munitions. “I’m not providing the 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage,” Biden said. He again pressed Israel for a “day-after” plan for the war’s end and spoke of his diplomacy to persuade Arab states to help with security. “At the end of the day, there has to be no occupation by Israel in the Gaza Strip,” Biden said. He also acknowledged he was “disappointed” by a pier to deliver aid into Gaza, which Biden announced in March and the US military built at a cost of $230 million as Israel impeded land routes for aid trucks. The United States plans soon to end the use of the pier permanently after it was plagued by problems, including the weather. “I was hopeful that would be more successful,” Biden said.",
