    "text": "Continued tourism recovery, strong promotion and ideal weather helped to make this year’s Winter Festival of Lights a “great success.”\n“Pacing ahead of last year’s visitation and donations at Dufferin Islands,” said David Adames, chief executive officer of Niagara Parks.\n“I believe the lights look the best this year and certainly the return of the interactive lights has been very positively received.”\nPresented by Niagara Falls Tourism, in partnership with Niagara Parks, the province, Tourism Partnership of Ontario and local business improvement areas, the 41st festival of lights began Nov. 18 and concludes Sunday after 51 nights.\nIt spans eight kilometres of Niagara Parkway, with more than three million lights and 75 displays.\nLast year the festival, which ran for 101 nights between Nov. 12 and Feb. 20, was impacted by a Christmas holidays blizzard, which impacted travel to and from the popular annual free attraction.\nBut that was not the case this year.\nYou might be interested in\n“It’s been a great success,” said Janice Thomson, president of Niagara Falls Tourism.\n“We’ve had good partnerships. If you see Lundy’s Lane, they really put their heart into it and invested more funds in it and they’ve got great new light exhibits. We put some new exhibits throughout the destination. The parks had some great interactive pieces that people really enjoyed. I think from that perspective, everything was very positive.”\nThomson said the festival is one of the highlights of living in the area.\n“Because we have a lot of families in the area hosting families visiting from other areas over the holidays, it becomes an event for them to get out in the car or get out and walk around and look at the exhibits,” she said.\n“It is one of those things that’s great to see the intersection of the visitors and the residents.”\nThomson said the success of this year’s festival mirrored the overall success experienced by the local tourism sector in 2023, as it continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Our weather was great this year. Lots of great promotion and lots of partners working together to get the message out that it’s the 41st year, and it was free, and we had new exhibits, and we had great hotel packages and restaurant offerings.”\nShe said the more “compacted time schedule” made people realize there “isn’t that extra month to think about coming.”\n“Last year, we went right through to Family Day in February, and we found that created some pressure, particularly on giving (Niagara Parks) time to disassemble some of their displays and get going on the horticultural work that needs to be done to get their property ready for the spring,” said Thomson.\n“We were creating too much of a tension there, the timelines were too tight, so we agreed we would go to Jan. 7. It also focused us on delivering a great experience, and then it also focused us on what are we going to do after Jan. 7, what’s next for Niagara Falls?”\nWhat’s next is Niagara Falls Tourism launching a new culinary festival called Flavours of Niagara Falls, taking place Jan. 13 to Feb. 11.\nThe monthlong celebration of culinary experiences will showcase Niagara Falls’ diverse culinary scene, featuring renowned celebrity chefs, exclusive dinners and prix fixe menus at more than 20 restaurants.\n“We’re having some guest chefs that are celebrities in other areas that are coming here to pair up with some of our chefs,” said Thomson.\nFollowing that, Niagara Falls Tourism will launch a “very large” spring campaign that will best position the destination to succeed come the busy spring and summer seasons.\n“We don’t generally have a lot of marketing during the summer, but we sort of fill the pump and the funnel early in the spring and that generates the traffic through, so those campaigns are being worked on now.”",

First Gen MTIA The first-generation MTIA has undergone significant technological advancements to its next-gen counterpart to meet the growing demands of AI workloads. Initially built with TSMC’s 7nm process, the first-gen MTIA had a frequency of 800MHz, supporting 1.12 billion gates and delivering up to 102.4 teraflops per second (TFLOPS/s) for INT8 operations. It was equipped with 128MB of on-chip memory and 64GB of off-chip LPDDR5 memory, with a TDP of 25 watts. This setup was optimized for a balance between performance and power efficiency, with a total memory bandwidth capacity that included 400GB/s per processing element (PE) for local memory and 800GB/s for on-chip memory.\nThe next-gen MTIA has shifted to TSMC’s more advanced 5nm process, enabling the accelerator to operate at a higher frequency of 1.35GHz. This upgrade doubles the gate count to 2.35 billion and increases the FLOPS to 103 million, indicating a substantial boost in the chip’s processing capabilities. The next-gen MTIA introduces a threefold increase in local PE storage and doubles the on-chip SRAM to 256MB while expanding off-chip LPDDR5 memory to 128GB. This increase is matched with enhanced memory bandwidth, reaching up to 1TB/s per PE for local memory and 2.7TB/s for on-chip memory, ensuring higher data throughput and efficiency.\nIn addition, the TDP is now 90 watts to accommodate the higher performance levels. The host connection has also been upgraded to 8x PCIe Gen5, doubling the bandwidth to 32GB/s, which supports faster data transfers between the accelerator and the host system. These notable improvements provide a stronger foundation for developing and deploying AI-driven applications and services.\nNext Gen MTIA Features At its core, the MTIA features sophisticated 8×8 grid PEs that significantly boost dense and sparse compute performances. This enhancement is attributed to architectural advancements and a substantial increase in local PE storage, on-chip SRAM, and bandwidth. Moreover, the accelerator’s improved network-on-chip (NoC) architecture facilitates speedy coordination between PEs, ensuring low-latency data processing essential for complex AI tasks.\nMeta’s approach extends beyond silicon innovation. The next-gen MTIA is supported by a robust rack-based system capable of housing up to 72 accelerators, offering considerable scaling potential for Meta’s ambitious AI projects. The system’s design allows for higher operation frequencies and efficiency, easily accommodating diverse model complexities.\nSoftware integration also plays a pivotal role in the MTIA’s ecosystem, with Meta leveraging its work on PyTorch to ensure seamless compatibility and developer productivity. The inclusion of advanced programming and execution frameworks, like Triton-MTIA, facilitates the efficient translation of AI models into high-performance computing instructions, streamlining the development process.\nInitial Performance Results of Next-gen MTIA Meta says preliminary performance metrics indicate a significant improvement over the first generation, demonstrating its capability to process simple and complex ranking and recommendation algorithms efficiently. This chip manages algorithms that vary significantly in size and computational demand, outperforming standard commercial GPUs thanks to Meta’s integrated technology approach. The company is focused on enhancing energy efficiency as it deploys these chips across its systems.\nInitial testing has shown that the next-generation MTIA chip triples the performance of its predecessor across key models. With an upgraded system that includes double the devices and a high-powered dual-socket CPU, Meta has achieved a six-fold increase in model processing throughput and a 50% improvement in energy efficiency over its first-generation MTIA setup. These improvements result from extensive optimizations in computing components and server architecture. Optimizing models has become quicker as the developer ecosystem matures, with ample room for further efficiency gains.\nNow active in data centers, the MTIA chip is enhancing Meta’s AI workload processing, proving to be a strategic complement to commercial GPUs. With several initiatives underway to extend MTIA’s functionalities, this release marks another big move toward the company’s commitment to advancing AI technology and its applications.",

    "text": "Iranian Christians in the diaspora shed few tears over the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash along with the foreign minister and six others in the northwest mountains of Iran. The leadership vacuum will be filled within 50 days by a new election. But it comes at a tumultuous time for the Islamic Republic, which last month launched an unprecedented missile attack against Israel. Coming in the context of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Iran’s other proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen have harassed the Jewish state and its Western allies. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared five days of mourning, assuring there would be no change in the nation’s direction. Raisi’s term in office was beset by internal protests over religious repression, alongside discontent with an inflationary economy. But while he oversaw restoration of diplomatic ties with rival Saudi Arabia, relations with the West severely deteriorated due to strengthening ties with Russia and China, as Iran enriched its uranium supply in suspected pursuit of a nuclear weapon. “Countless thousands of Christians are specifically praying for God’s will in Iran,” said Lana Silk, CEO of Transform Iran, which oversees a network of churches in the nation. “I believe his hand is on all these key events.” She advised the Western church to pray for new God-fearing leadership. Of the now deceased leader, Christians expressed a diverse emotional response. “From all of my contacts, the reaction among educated and socially engaged Iranians is joy,” said Shirin Taber, executive director of Empower Women Media, dedicated to the promotion of international religious freedom. “With the potential for change, there is always hope.” An Iranian-American Christian, she said these deaths demonstrate that not only is the regime not invincible, it is on the decline. Reports [indicated](https://apnews.com/article/iran-president-ebrahim-raisi-426c6f4ae2dd1f0801c73875bb696f48) that the presidential helicopter unwisely departed in deep fog and also suffered mechanical failure. Taber also leads the Abraham Women’s Alliance to strengthen the Abraham Accords, a US government–led effort to normalize relations between Muslim nations and Israel. In this time of transition in Iran, she encouraged Western nations to continue to “lean in” to the push for democracy. Raisi, age 63, was elected in 2021 with the lowest turnout recorded since Iran’s revolution in 1979. Analysts [blamed](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran/iran-death-president) widespread disillusion, as clerical leadership severely limited the pool of candidates to those with demonstrated loyalty to Ayatollah Khamenei. Raisi was also considered to be the primary candidate to succeed the 85-year-old supreme leader. Sources noted the widespread [speculations](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/05/20/iran-president-raisi-death-speculation/) over the crash. Some rumors immediately suspected Israel, while others wondered about internal power struggles. Iran has not suggested foul play. But while state media [broadcast](https://www.dw.com/en/how-are-iranians-reacting-to-president-raisis-death/a-69142629) scenes of mourning at the funeral and in the streets of Iran, diaspora images [showed](https://apnews.com/article/iran-diaspora-raisi-death-reaction-c2d29d9bb3cc4dfde25d00f29bc7685c) dancing in the streets. Some Christian voices were more muted. “My initial reaction is that justice was done,” said Amir Bazmjou, CEO of Torch Ministries and an Oxford-based PhD candidate in political science and Christian theology. “God heard the voices of families who lost their loved ones unjustly because of Raisi.” Referring to the president by his infamous title “Butcher of Tehran” due to his role in the “death committee” that executed thousands of prisoners, Bazmjou cited the Ezekiel 18:23 reference that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Raisi, born into a clerical family, [joined](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/19/ebrahim-raisi-irans-hardline-president-dogged-by-execution-claims) in the initial protests against the Shah of Iran at age 15, and by age 25 became deputy prosecutor of Tehran. In 1988, he was one of four judges on the secret tribunal that retried already imprisoned enemies of the regime. In 2009, Raisi backed crackdowns on protestors and their mass incarcerations following the disputed presidential election. And as president, in 2022, he oversaw the security response against demonstrations sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman detained over her allegedly loose hijab. Over 500 people were killed, with 22,000 detained. The US sanctioned Raisi in 2019 for his role in domestic repression. Bazmjou encouraged Western empathy over the death of Iran’s president, but to stand with the oppressed public while avoiding siding with the regime. Such was the US response, expressing condolences while [reaffirming](https://www.state.gov/on-the-death-of-iranian-president-raisi-and-others-in-a-helicopter-crash/) support for the people and their “struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms.” But as the pool of approved politicians tightens, Bazmjou believed that the helicopter deaths contribute to the further shrinking of core loyalists that can assume future leadership positions. Like Taber, he believes these gaps may foretell significant change in the near future. This would accord with a picture provided in Scripture, he said. MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN, read the writing on the wall in Daniel 5—God’s message to King Belshazzar of Babylon. God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. “I pray for the political leaders in Iran to turn from their dark ways and encounter the God of love, justice, and holiness,” said Bazmjou. “Otherwise, God’s justice will come for the voiceless, Christians included.” A recent survey [suggested](https://christianitytoday.com/news/2020/september/iran-christian-conversions-gamaan-religion-survey.html?share=3AE+li59WeW/wdy3L8Sp2IIthL8Z0gdb&utm_medium=widgetsocial) there are nearly one million believers inside Iran. For any who celebrate, he cited Proverbs 21:15 as appropriate for both Christians and Iranian leaders—When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. Mansour Borji agreed, citing Psalm 55:15—Let death take my enemies by surprise. Christians may not fully comprehend the relationship between God’s mercy and his judgment, said the director of the Iranian religious freedom advocacy organization Article18, but he allows the frustrated to express their anger at those who harm their fellow citizens. As Raisi violated the rights of minorities, Borji is somewhat frustrated still. “It would have been better for him to face trial and be held accountable for his crimes,” he said. “But the world is a safer place without him.” Silk, however, warned that potential internal Iranian power struggles would not bode well for citizens, as authorities will rule with an even tighter fist. Persecution against Christians will continue and perhaps intensify. But as Bazmjou found biblical parallel with the king of Babylon, Silk referenced a prophecy about ancient Elam, located in modern-day Iran. Restoration is promised, she said, but not before judgment. In Jeremiah 49:38, God states, I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy her king and officials. “We cannot presume to know God’s mind,” Silk said. “But things are accelerating, and I wonder if the major shift we have been anticipating is closer than we think.” [Support Our Work](/membership?utm_medium=site&utm_source=support-our-work&utm_content=main-offer) [Subscribe to CT](/membership?utm_medium=site&utm_source=support-our-work&utm_content=main-offer) for less than $4.25/month",
