    "text": "KARACHI: Some parts of Karachi received rainfall coupled with strong winds on the second consecutive day, bringing relief to citizens amid hot and humid weather. Heavy showers with strong winds hit Karachi's Gulistan-e-Johar area, whereas, downpours also lash areas near Sharea Faisal and Karsaz which caused trouble for commuters due to overflowing of drains and traffic jams. Traffic jam was also witnessed at Sharea Faisal as rainwater submerged both tracks of the arterial road from Drigh Road to Karsaz. Additionally, at least four persons sustained injuries after two buses collided near Drigh Road Railway Station, which further affected the flow of traffic at Sharea Faisal, according to police. The fresh spell of isolated rains was already predicted by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) which also forecast earlier today that it will not bring down the provincial capital’s soaring temperature. Mercury in the port city may reach up to 40°C and won't be impacted by the possibility of rain, PMD Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz said. The residents of Karachi, a day earlier, got some respite from the sweltering heat after brief showers accompanied by strong winds and hailstorms hit some parts of the port city, turning the weather pleasant.

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The United States (US) on Thursday (Feb 1) imposed sanctions on four Israeli settlers as President Joe Biden said violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank had reached intolerable levels.\nThe sanctions marked a rare US move against Israelis as war rages with Hamas in the Gaza Strip following the militants' Oct 7 attack. It came as Mr Biden travelled to Michigan, where many in the sizable Arab American community have voiced anger over his support for Israel.\n\"The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability,\" Mr Biden said in an executive order laying the groundwork for US actions.\nThe State Department later announced sanctions against four settlers. Any assets they hold in the United States will be blocked, with Americans forbidden from financial transactions with them.\nThe four include David Chai Chasdai who is accused of leading a riot in the flashpoint town of Huwara in which Palestinian homes were torched and a Palestinian civilian killed following an attack that killed two Israelis.\nOther targets included Yinon Levi, who is accused of leading a group of settlers from the unauthorised outpost of Meitarim Farm who have assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, burned their fields and destroyed their property.\n\"Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,\" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has repeatedly raised settler violence with Israel and leaves shortly on a new trip to the region.\nMr Blinken warned against actions that jeopardize the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, an idea that is strongly opposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government which includes settler advocates.\nIsrael criticised the sanctions by its close ally, saying the \"overwhelming majority\" of its citizens in the West Bank were law-abiding.\n\"Israel acts against all Israelis who break the law, everywhere; therefore, exceptional measures are unnecessary,\" said a statement by Netanyahu's office.\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Israel had prosecuted three of the four settlers but that more action was needed.\n\"We will not hesitate to take additional actions as necessary,\" he said.\nMOST VIOLENT YEAR ON RECORD The action marks the first financial sanctions against settlers although the Biden administration earlier announced that it would refuse visas for extremists involved in violence.\nMr Biden has defended Israel's right to respond, and resisted calls to seek a ceasefire, after the Hamas attack inside Israel on Oct 7 killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nMr Biden, however, has also voiced exasperation with Mr Netanyahu and the high toll on civilians as Israel pounds the Gaza Strip with a stated goal of eradicating Hamas.\nAt least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\nArab Americans largely backed Mr Biden as he defeated former president Donald Trump in 2020 and, while a small part of the national population, they could swing the election in Michigan, which is critical for the Democratic president's success in an expected rematch against Trump in November.\nThe mayor of one Detroit suburb is refusing to see Mr Biden on his trip due to his refusal to press Israel to end the military campaign.\nIsraeli settlers killed at least 10 Palestinians and torched dozens of homes in the occupied West Bank in 2023, making it the \"most violent\" year on record for settler attacks, according to the human rights group Yesh Din.\nAbout 490,000 settlers live among approximately three million Palestinians in the West Bank, in settlements that are considered illegal under international law.\nMr Biden has largely returned to historic US opposition to the settlements after Trump switched gears and declined to criticise the outposts, with his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, visiting a settlement late in his term.\nThe Biden administration is also renewing calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, an idea strongly opposed by Mr Netanyahu's government.

    "title": "What America is Getting Wrong About Health Insurance | CSG Actuarial",
    "text": "The senseless killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has shocked the nation. While the vast majority of Americans are horrified, an unhinged minority has taken delight in this tragedy, revealing a shocking ignorance about how health insurance works.\nInsurance, in general, is an industry people love to hate. It feels like a con: You pay good money for premiums and seemingly get nothing in return if you don’t experience the insured event. But this misses the point.\nWhat you “consume” when you buy insurance isn’t health care — it’s protection from the financial ruin you’d face if disaster struck. That peace of mind is enormously valuable and is the reason insurance exists. Living under the constant threat of catastrophic loss is traumatic. Insurance lets us trade uncertainty for security.\nStill, people feel frustrated with the industry, and much of that frustration stems from misconceptions about what insurance can and cannot do. Ideally, we’d like to insure against getting sick altogether, but that’s impossible.\nInsurance can only limit the financial burden of illness, not the suffering itself. This limitation is understandably unsatisfying. In a perfect world, the agony of cancer could be spread across a thousand people as nothing more than a paper cut. But the world doesn’t work that way.\nDenials of care have also dominated recent conversations. While the primary benefit of insurance is risk protection, it comes with a downside: It reduces or eliminates the consumer’s direct cost of care. When something is free, people tend to use more of it. This is called “moral hazard.”\nThe famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment in the 1970s illustrated this point. Participants in a “free care” plan (with zero cost-sharing) used 30 percent more health care than those in a high-cost-sharing plan where individuals paid 95 percent of their medical expenses. Crucially, this increased utilization had no meaningful effect on health outcomes.\nBut moral hazard isn’t the whole story. Health care providers — particularly those paid on a fee-for-service basis — also respond to incentives. Physicians are almost always motivated by the best interests of their patients, but they’re also human. And humans respond to financial incentives.\nWhen doctors are paid more for doing more, there’s a natural tendency to favor action over inaction, even when the best course might be watchful waiting. This dynamic is amplified when patients face little or no out-of-pocket cost, making “doing something” feel preferable to “doing nothing.”\nAnother critical point often overlooked is the role of employers. Roughly two-thirds of workers are employed by firms that self-insure, meaning the employer pays the claims while the insurer simply processes them. This makes the employer the real payer, not the insurance company.\nEmployers decide how aggressively they want insurers to push back on questionable or excessive treatments. Insurers, in turn, employ physicians and analyze mountains of data to make coverage decisions. These decisions are not arbitrary; they reflect the payer’s desire to control costs in a system heavily biased toward expensive interventions — some necessary and lifesaving, others less so.",
