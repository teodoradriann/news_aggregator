    "text": "Assassin's Creed Shadows delayed again\nVideo game giant Ubisoft has announced a further delay to its upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows.\nThe long-running series is one of the French publisher's flagship franchises, with recent instalment, Valhalla, reportedly making more than $1bn.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows, set in 16th Century Japan, was due to be released on PC, PlayStation and Xbox last November before an initial delay to February 2025.\nAnnouncing the new release date of 20 March, executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté said a \"few additional weeks are needed\" to ensure the game's launch goes smoothly.\nPlayers complained that Ubisoft's major 2024 release, Star Wars Outlaws, was launched with bugs and glitches.\nThe company's bosses told investors the sci-fi tie-in's sales were \"softer than expected\" and said \"learnings\" from Outlaws' launch had prompted the original delay to Assassin's Creed Shadows.\nIn his update, Mr Coté thanked fans for their support and said the extra time would allow the development team to implement \"valuable feedback\" from gamers.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is seen as an important title for Ubisoft - one of the biggest gaming companies in the world with an estimated 13,000 employees worldwide.\nIts other 2024 titles, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and pirate-themed online game Skull & Bones, were also reported to have fallen below the company's expectations.\nThe company also discontinued online shooter XDefiant and closed three of its studios.\nIn a conference call held around the same time as the Assassin's Creed delay was made public, CEO Yves Guillemot told investors Ubisoft was \"taking decisive steps\" to reshape the company.\nIt was also looking to \"drive significant cost reductions\", the meeting heard.\n'Strong appeal'\nBBC Newsbeat previously spoke to James Batchelor, former editor-in-chief of Gamesindustry.biz, who said the Assassin's Creed series is a \"golden goose\" for Ubisoft.\nHe said moving the game from its original November release date meant Ubisoft had missed out on sales from the busy pre-Christmas sales period.\nBut, he also said it would have faced stiff competition in February - a crowded month for high-profile new releases, with Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed and Civilization VII also due to come out.\nWhile Ubisoft's 2024 had been \"tough\", James told Newsbeat that colleagues who'd played preview versions of Assassin's Creed Shadows were impressed with the game.\nHe also pointed out that its feudal Japan setting was one series fans had been requesting for a long time, and he expected this to drive sales.\n\"Whether or not it sells quite the levels it would have done in November, or whether it sells as well as they hope. I don't know,\" he said.\n\"But of all the things they've put out in the last year and the varied performance they've had, this one has got the strongest chance and the strongest appeal.\"",

    "title": "Florida priest who bit woman at communion said it's self defense | wtsp.com",
    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Fla. — An argument over holy communion at a Central Florida church ended with a priest biting a woman in the arm, according to the St. Cloud Police Department. It happened around 1:15 p.m. Sunday at [St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Thomas+Aquinas+Catholic+Church/@28.2331864,-82.3235042,10z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sSt.+Thomas+Aquinas+Catholic+Church+st+cloud%5C!3m6!1s0x88dd8fa662950bc1:0x101ae58dd779ba48!8m2!3d28.2503423!4d-81.3105375!15sCixTdC4gVGhvbWFzIEFxdWluYXMgQ2F0aG9saWMgQ2h1cmNoIHN0IGNsb3VkXJIBD2NhdGhvbGljX2NodXJjaOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F1tf3cbrr?entry=ttu), where a woman was attending mass for her niece's First Communion. Police said the priest refused to give the woman a communion host during the 10 a.m. mass because she did not take the proper steps to receive it. The priest told officers the woman tried to grab the host between her index finger and thumb, \"like you are taking a cookie\" rather than accepting it in the palm of her hand or in her mouth, which is standard in the Catholic Church. In a statement captured on bodycam footage, the priest said her actions led him to believe she had not completed the necessary sacraments to receive holy communion. He told the woman if she did confession after mass, she could return for the next mass and receive communion. When the woman came back for the 12 p.m. mass and went to receive communion, the priest reportedly asked her if she had done confession between the masses. The priest said she refused to answer and instead tried to grab her own host from the tray — an action he called \"sacrilegious.\" The priest told police he grabbed her hand to stop her, and she pushed him in response. \"I have the bowl with the holy hosts which, for us, is sacred. She grabbed all the hosts in the hands because she wants to receive them herself and she is not permitted,\" he told police. \"She breaks all the hosts.\" This action, the priest admitted, led him to bite her arm in self-defense. “The only defense that I can find to defend something that, for all of us, is sacred was biting her. I recognize that I bit her. I am not denying that,\" the priest said in a statement to police. \"I recognize that I bit her as a defense — defending myself and defending the sacrament,\" he added. The woman told police she believed she was singled out because of her sexuality and attire, a white button-down and pants. The priest told police he was not aware of her sexuality and would not judge someone or deny them communion based on their appearance. He added that there are several members of the LGBTQ+ community who attend the church and receive communion. In a statement provided to [WKMG](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2024/05/23/accepted-by-god-florida-priest-accused-of-biting-woman-during-communion/), the Diocese of Orlando claimed the priest was \"trying to protect the Holy Communion\" from the woman's \"sacrilegious act.\" “In the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion. It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,\" the statement said, in part. The state will determine whether the priest will face any charges.",

    "text": "The director of The Zone of Interest accepted his award with an anti-war speech that drew praise and confusion.\nBy Shirley Li\nRich Polk / Variety / Getty March 11, 2024 Share\nSave\nThe Oscars are not built for somber appeals about current events, though the show has tried in the past to balance celebration with seriousness. Sometimes that effort has worked: In 2002, after 9/11, Tom Cruise opened the evening with a vague but elegant speech about needing movie magic “more than ever,” which eased the apparent anxiety in the room. Other times, it couldn’t completely control the proceedings: In 2003, shortly after the Iraq War began, the show tried to dissuade flashy displays of emotion and even scrapped the red carpet. But the notoriously vocal director Michael Moore had other ideas, using his Best Documentary acceptance speech to criticize President George W. Bush until he was booed offstage.\nThis year seemed poised for another festive but dry evening, devoid of any real reminders of life outside Hollywood. But then the historical drama The Zone of Interest won for Best International Feature, and the director, Jonathan Glazer, flanked by two of the film’s producers, used his speech to deliver a stark message to the audience. “Right now,” he said, his hands shaking as he held the piece of paper on which he’d written his remarks, “we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza—all the victims of this dehumanization.” (Unsurprisingly, the response to his remarks has been intense—a mix of praise and derision but also confusion stemming from some people seizing on only the first part of what he said, and assuming he was refuting his Jewishness full-stop.)",

    "text": "[Estauracio](/user/Estauracio)a [ultimasnoticias.com.ve](/go/link/3971617) [#1](c1#c-1) Una cómplice más de la dictadura de Maduro que terminará en la cárcel.\nTienen el ejemplo de Añez que se va a pasar lo que le queda de vida en la cárcel.\nMe imagino que no habrá ningún problema en hacer públicas las actas electorales.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Me imagino que ya habrán tenido tiempo de falsificar las actas.\nTambién piden que hagan públicas las actas, casi un mes después... Se ve venir.\n[#33](c33#c-33) El chavismo lleva custodiando las actas, las urnas con votos y las máquinas de votación desde hace un mes. Ellos dirán que las suyas son las buenas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Eres un facha que no acepta los resultados legítimos de un país democrático y soberano. Las elecciones en Venezuela son las más seguras del mundo y el Supremo es un organismo profesional e independiente.\nNo hay más que ver quienes lo integran para estar totalmente seguro de su imparcialidad y profesional, yo confio >\nEsta es Caryslia Beatriz Rodríguez, la presidenta del Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela [#1](c1#c-1) Bueno, ya era oficial desde 2015 cuando la oposición arrasó en las elecciones legislativas (consiguieron 2/3 de los diputados) y Maduro simplemente ignoró al parlamento se creó su propia asamblea con el 100% de los diputados a su favor. Ahora la dictadura continua.\n[#27](c27#c-27) Ah, que en Venezuela se voto en el 2015, y ya es para siempre, te recuerdo que no fue al presidente.\n[#27](c27#c-27) exacto, dejo esto para que se recuerde lo que ocurrió en 2015 y 2017\nhttps://www.infobae.com/venezuela/2024/07/27/el-recuerdo-de-las-legislativas-2015-la-victoria-opositora-que-llevo-a-maduro-a-terminar-de-convertir-su-regimen-en-una-dictadura/\nLa victoria en las parlamentarias del 2015 parecía sembrar una luz de esperanza en un pueblo que soñaba con un cambio.\nLa victoria en las urnas no solamente representó una ventaja legislativa para la oposición que pasó a ocupar 109 bancas contra 55 del Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) y 3 de Representación Indígena\nEn 2016, el TSJ anuló todas las decisiones de la Asamblea Nacional opositora, alegando que los legisladores incurrieron en desacato al incorporar a tres diputados cuya elección había sido impugnada. Esta medida, junto con otras decisiones del TSJ, limitó significativamente el poder legislativo del Parlamento opositor y llevó al país a un nuevo nivel de confrontación: el conflicto de Poderes.\nEl chavismo se impuso en el poder legislativo por medio de la creación ilegal de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente (ANC) en 2017, Maduro halló el camino para perpetuarse en el poder y evitar que los opositores bloquearan sus políticas y reformas.\nLa razón de ser de la ANC era sostener un parlamento paralelo, en el que solo fueron admitidos diputados chavistas. Si bien la Constitución venezolana contempla la creación de nuevos organismos, para que estos sean considerados oficiales deben ser aprobados por medio de un referéndum.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Resumen: tenemos los resultados de verdad, y las actas pero no se las podemos mostrar. También nos hackearon, de verdad, créannos, se los juramos por este puño de cruces. Porque yo lo digo.\n[#14](c14#c-14) no. Pero que daba igual que dijese maduro, el cne, el TSJ venezolano o el espíritu de Chávez reencarnado en un pájaro dando un mitin en un balcón de Miraflores ni cotizaba.\nSe decidió que había ganado el guaido de turno, y de ahí no se ha de mover nadie.\nMientras el país seguirá manejado por un completo inútil, solo superado por la inutilidad de su oposición\n[#21](c21#c-21) Guaidó Guaidó Guaidó... Comodín universal.\nLo que se os olvida el porqué de Guaidó, la oposición ganó la Asamblea Nacional y el chavismo creo otra y despojo ilegalmente a la original de funciones. La dictadura chavista no empezó hoy.\n[#24](c24#c-24) ¿he negado yo que lo que tienen ahí montado sea una aberración?\nPero de todas formas, puedes volver al comentario inicial. Si hoy el TSJ hubiese dicho que no ganó Maduro entonces de repente si que tendría legitimidad y la separación de poderes estaría restaurada?\nPues eso, que unos no se van a ir por las buenas, y los otros son todavía más inútiles y no han de aceptar nada que no sea un todo. Y así hasta que se líen a tiros bien.\nPero dramas de otra petro dictadura, que por algún motivo nos tiene que importar mucho. Ya me avisas cuando salgan las actas de cualquiera de nuestros otros proveedores de crudo como los sauditas\n[#32](c32#c-32) sí, pero si hoy el TSJ dice lo contrario de repente tendría legitimidad y sería menos dictadura. No?\nVuelve a mi primer comentario entonces, da igual lo que hagan o digan en Venezuela a estas alturas.\n[#42](c42#c-42) Que el chavismo diga que el chavismo ha ganado las elecciones no tiene ninguna legítimad. Legitimidad tendría si hubieran hecho público las actas hace ya casi un mes, lo que presenten ahora, ya poca fiabilidad tiene.\nsí, pero si hoy el TSJ dice lo contrario de repente tendría legitimidad y sería menos dictadura. No?\n[#46](c46#c-46) Maduro tiene de Chávez el pájaro que le habla.\nFlaco favor se le hace a nadie encumbrandolo en su propio discurso de que es continuismo cuando es posiblemente uno de los más mediocres políticos de América latina. Y hay competencia.\nPor suerte para él en su casa lo tiene fácil con la almagama de golpistas con las espaldas cubiertas por 'occidente' que tiene enfrente para bunquerizarse\n[#18](c18#c-18) ¿Realmente estás comparando la seriedad de ambas instituciones? Aunque el TS español sea muy objetable, es que no es lo mismo en absoluto.\nEl golpe de estado de Maduro se ha hecho realidad... una victoria electoral sin mostrar públicamente los resultados detallados y contradiciendo, por mucho, el resultado el 83% de las actas conocidas.\nHabría que recordar a la neutral Presidenta del Tribunal Supremo:\n[#12](c12#c-12) la dictadura de Maduro es dictadura o vecino según interese.\nPor ejemplo hace unos meses pasó a vecino que podía vender petroleo a USA.\nCosas de ser el amo, que ellos mismos definen las reglas y la ley del embudo\n[#16](c16#c-16) EEUU le puso a Maduro como condición hacer unas elecciones limpias y como gesto de buena voluntad retiró las sanciones. Maduro no ha cumplido, pues vuelven las sanciones.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Ahora es cuando dicen tener pruebas de que en Venezuela hay \"arepas de destrucción masiva\" e inician una acción militar preventiva, lo habitual en el matón policía de la democracia en los países con petróleo que no les rinden pleitesía.\nYa lo dijo Trump... \"EEUU se tendría que haber quedado con todo su petróleo\".\n[#20](c20#c-20) Ya sabes, si EEUU mueve ficha Maduro negocia con los BRIC's la cesión de sus reservas y a ver si a China-Rusia le van a quitar el contrato\ninfluencer-venezolano-greg-aventuras-confiesa-haber-recibido/c012#c-12",
