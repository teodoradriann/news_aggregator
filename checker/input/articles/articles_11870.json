    "title": "Best Therapist Hong Kong Maple Tree Counselling Announces New Corporate Wellness Program And Welcomes Dr. Amanda Friday - 新浪香港",
    "text": "12月28日 17:11 GlobeNewswire Central, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Central, Hong Kong –\nCentral, Hong Kong – Maple Tree Counselling is happy to announce that it now offers psychological counselling and corporate wellness programmes. The boutique counselling and therapy practice in Hong Kong also welcomes Dr Amanda Friday, a psychological counsellor, as the newest member of its team of therapists. Dr. Friday is a specialist in organisational and individual change through leading edge consulting, therapy, and narrative research. As an expert in the field of psychology, they are passionate about helping other people grow and enhance their overall well-being. Whether it’s for personal growth, addressing various organisational challenges, or for performance enhancement, Dr. Friday has applied their unique expertise to corporate training, individual therapy, and sports performance and retirement. For more information visit https://www.mapletreecounselling.com/hong-kong/counsellors/\nDr. Friday is Western-educated and classically trained in psychotherapy, and has spent the last seven years conducting advanced research, clinical work, professional development training, and completing their Ph.D. Having served as a professor at Georgetown University and with experience in talent and learning development, research, and psychology, Dr. Friday has the reputation of being a people-mechanic, a gear shifter, and a reconciler of tensions and conflict, whether between individuals and groups, or within themselves.\nIt’s important to note that there are important differences between a psychologist and a counsellor in terms of qualifications, training, and scope of practice. A counsellor helps individuals, families, couples, or groups find a solution for their personal, emotional, or psychological problems. They usually offer support, practical advice and guidance to help their clients cope with various challenges, make decisions, and boost their well-being.\nOn the other hand, psychologists have a wider scope of practice. They are able to diagnose and offer treatment for mental disorders, perform psychological assessments, and provide counselling or therapy services. They need to have completed extensive education and training in psychology, usually by obtaining a doctoral degree (Ph.D. or Psy.D). They typically have a specialisation in certain areas, including counselling psychology, educational psychology, or clinical psychology.\nDr Friday helps clients through various challenges, including: work and sports performance; stress management; life and career transitions; depression; anxiety; burnout; relationship challenges; mood and emotional regulation; sleep difficulties; and trauma and PTSD. They also help clients achieve increased self-awareness and motivation; improved relationships; a greater sense of purpose and direction; empowerment; reduction of psychological distress and other symptoms; improved coping skills; enhanced self-esteem; and better life satisfaction.\nFor their corporate wellness programme in Hong Kong , Dr Friday believes that at the core of every successful organisation lies the vitality and wellness of its team members. It is with this spirit that Maple Tree Counselling’s team has developed its comprehensive list of corporate programmes and Essentials for Change package. With its deep understanding of the influence of mental health and well-being on employee productivity, engagement, and overall organisational success, Maple Tree offers a range of services designed to foster a positive work culture and encourage resilience among employees. The corporate programmes are based on expertise, empathy, and excellence, traits which are indicative of its commitment to providing high-quality wellness services. The programmes are refreshing, research-driven, live-taught, sticky, simple, and focused on game-changer skills to ensure long-lasting impact.\nThe programmes available through Maple Tree Counselling are designed to help teams and groups through conflict resolution; boosting of morale; resolution of stress and burnout; adapting to change; communication challenges; leadership and team dynamics; innovation; organisational change and inclusion; goal alignment; employee retention; and feedback and evaluation. These programmes have the goal of cultivating a significant increase in group cohesion; unity and shared purpose; improved communication and empathy; clarity of goals and vision; enhanced creativity and problem-solving; improved conflict resolution skills; reduced group dysfunction; support for collective and individual growth; improved productivity and performance; and increased motivation and morale.\nLaunched in 2021, Maple Tree Counselling had its beginnings in Hong Kong through the shared vision of a number of friends and colleagues who wanted to respond to the growing demand for mental health services with a real commitment towards helping people. Maple Tree Counselling delivers services to both adult and adolescent clients (14 years old and above). It offers both individual and couples counselling, as well as corporate wellness programmes, delivered both online and in person. Sessions can be conducted in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English.

    "text": "Kashmiri Leader Welcomes South Africa's Move To Hold Israel Accountable For Gaza Massacre\nSumaira FH\nPublished December 31, 2023 | 03:50 PM\nWAHINGTON, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 31st Dec, 2023) A prominent Kashmiri leader has said that\nSouth Africa's move to sue Israel in the world court for \"genocidal acts\" in Gaza and a similar case filed by Gambia against Myanmar for atrocities against Rohingya Muslims were \"significant\" steps towards addressing human right abuses committed against civilians.\n\"Filing of an application at the International\nCourt of Justice (ICJ) may take the veil of secrecy off of the alleged human rights violations,\" Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai, Chairman of World Forum for Peace & Justice, said in a statement released on Sunday.\n\"Perhaps now the global community can\nshare the outrage felt by the people of the region,\" Dr Fai said, hoping the world would now turn its attention to Kashmir where atrocities of a similar pattern are being perpetrated by the 900,000 Indian forces with impunity.\n\"The scale of the human rights atrocities in Kashmir dwarfs those in Kosovo, Bosnia,\nSierra Leone, and East Timor which have triggered international interventions,\" he said.\n\"But the\nworld powers and the United Nations have remained silent, not even employing moral suasion against India's shocking indiscriminate violence in Kashmir as was done in South Africa during its ugly years of apartheid.\"\nPointing out that Dr Gregory Stanton, President of the Genocide Watch, had warned the\nworld community in 2021 that the https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/india.html government’s actions in Kashmir had been an extreme case of persecution and could lead to genocide, he regretted that there was no response to the sounding of that alarm.\n\"It is painful to note the virtual\nimmunity https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/india.html law gives to any type of war crime against humanity perpetrated in Kashmir,\" Dr Fai said.\n\"Common Kashmiris also asks: Are Kashmiris less human than peoples of other nations?\"",

    "text": "Several sportspersons, including wrestlers and bodybuilders, joined the AAP in the presence of party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, giving a boost to the party ahead of the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls.\nKejriwal welcomed Tilak Raj, Rohit Dalal and Akshay Dilawari, who are associated with sports and fitness, at the AAP office and handed party scarves and caps to them.\n“I am very happy that Tilak Raj, Rohit Dalal, Akshay Dilwari, and around 70-80 bodybuilders and wrestlers are joining the AAP. It is very important for all of us to stay healthy. Without health, everything else becomes meaningless. Rohit, Tilak, and Akshay have represented India at various levels—national and international—in wrestling and other sports. They also train many young people and children in Delhi and inspire the general public to stay healthy by offering various types of training,” he said, promising that after retaining power in the capital, the AAP will work towards resolving the issues faced by sportspersons.\nKejriwal said in the coming days, many more gymnasium owners and sportspersons will join the party. Speaker of the outgoing Assembly Ram Niwas Goel said those who joined the AAP on Thursday have significant influence, especially in Delhi's gyms, and wanted to contribute to the party's mission.\nDalal praised the party's initiatives, such as free yoga classes and support for sports development, which inspired him to join it. \"The work done for sportspersons and gyms is commendable. I want to contribute to this mission,\" he added.\nTilakraj expressed optimism about the sporting fraternity's growing involvement in politics. \"Many players from Delhi are planning to join us. We are committed to working hard and strengthening the party,\" he said.\nThe AAP is aiming for a third consecutive full term in the Delhi polls and hoping that this strategic outreach to sports and fitness professionals will resonate with voters.",

    "text": "Ligue 1 would suffer greatly without the Qataris, according to former Paris Saint-Germain striker Nicolas Anelka, who believes their involvement has been good for the French top flight.\n“If Qatar decides to leave, it would be very bad for the French league, which is already in trouble. It is up to them to ask themselves the question. Why so much stubbornness with Qatar and Nasser Al-Khelafi because that’s not the solution,” the former Euro 2000 champions with France told RMC Sport .\nSince the arrival of QS1 in 2011, PSG have dominated French football, winning 10 Ligue 1 titles, seven Coupe de France trophies, and 11 Trophée des Champions.\nAu micro de RMC Sport, Nicolas Anelka s’est exprimé sur le projet de QSI depuis son arrivée au PSG en 2011. Pour l’ancien attaquant du club, le niveau d’implication des Qataris reste intact au fil des années. https://t.co/Gwi4lvhh7g\n— RMC Sport (@RMCsport) March 1, 2025 While they’ve not won anything on the European stage since Al-Khelaifi’s arrival, Les Parisiens have finished as UEFA Champions League runners-up once (2020) and made the semi-finals on three separate occasions.\nThey currently find themselves in the quarter-finals of that competition with a match against Aston Villa coming up. Anelka also points out that the club have made a lot of investment lately in a new training centre.\nWhile he acknowledges the kind of power Al-Khelaifi has, for Anelka, it’s normal for others to be concerned about things , but he believes it’s par for the course when your club has the biggest budget in France and you’re the president of that team.\nHe added that Al-Khelaifi’s power isn’t that different from Jean-Michel Aulas’s tenure at Olympique Lyonnais in the early 2000s and Bernard Tapie’s tenure in the 1980s and 90s at Olympique de Marseille.\nAulas saw Lyon win seven Ligue 1 titles in the 2000s, and by 2008, the club was the 13th most valuable football team according to Forbes, with the magazine valuing them at €383m.\nTapie’s Marseille team was littered with stars and high-end talent winning four French top-flight crowns in the late 1980s and early 90s.\nOM also made two Champions League finals and became the only French side to lift the trophy when it was known as the European Cup in 1993.",

    "text": "Teenager Got Their Step Brother Thrown in Jail After He Destroyed Their Clothes. – ‘I couldn’t stop smiling.’\nby Matthew Gilligan\nJail time over some clothes?\nJust what the heck is going on here?!?!\nWell, we are\ntalking about Reddit’s “Pro Revenge” page, so you know it’s gotta be good.\nThe person who wrote it was a teenager when this all went down…\nDestroy my clothes? Enjoy your time in jail.\n“So this happened when I was 14/15. My mother was married to a man who had an adult son from a previous marriage – I think he was mid-20s.\nThis guy was…interesting…\nHe lived the hippie life – literally on the streets by choice, and about once a year or so he would hitchhike his way to our house with his friends, do copious amounts of laundry and weed, and generally just take over as if it was their house. They even left the gas burners on once because they “forgot” they turned the stove on.\nAnyhow, like any teenage girl, I was obsessed with my clothes. I had laundry sitting in the dryer, including these awesome corduroy pants I had only worn once. Step-bro and friends are doing laundry and instead of doing something normal like moving my stuff aside or putting it in my room, they decide, “oh man it would be so dope to cut these up and make like a sweet cape!” So that’s what they did.\nThen they saw it.\nI saw step-bro wearing this “cape” and recognized the material. “Are those my pants?!?!?” I exclaimed. “They were in the laundry, man, ya know, like finders keepers.” I was furious and his dad wouldn’t do anything about it. My mom was mad because she had just bought these for me and they were pricey. Mom didn’t like this annual visit anyhow, but to keep her marriage, she put up with it.\nI wanted to get back at step-bro but he had nothing of value because of his lifestyle. Then I remembered I overheard my parents fighting and my mom had mentioned step-bro had got a girl pregnant, and the kid was like 2 years old and he hadn’t so much as given the girl a penny or even seen the child since it was born.\nThey decided to take action.\nSo the next day, my parents were at work, step-bro is hanging out, listening to music or something, I decide to call the cops. I wasn’t sure what to say, but I told the dispatcher I knew of someone who might have a warrant out for failure to pay child support (now before you say, how would a teenager know about that?\nWell my birth father is a demon and was at one point nearly arrested for that same offense). The dispatcher asked the name of the person, I gleefully gave step-bro’s name and they confirmed there was in fact a warrant out for him. I gave my address and waited.\n20 mins later, cops roll up. T\nhey knock and I let them in, and lead them right to him, “he’s right here, officers!”\nI couldn’t stop smiling.\nThey cuff him and take him off to jail.\nAnd they got a bit of a surprise from their mom.\nAn hour later my mom calls the house after step-bro had used his phone call to call his dad, and I tell her exactly what I did.\nShe whispered, “good job,” but then pretended to loudly reprimand me as she was with step-dad.\nStep-dad couldn’t get the fine and bail money together fast enough, so step-bro had to sit in jail overnight.\nStill makes me happy 20 years later to remember seeing him being taken away in a cop car.\nMy mom luckily divorced that jerk and is now married to a very nice man.”\nCheck out what folks had to say.\nThis person shared their favorite part of the story.\nAnother individual has dealt with a laundry thief before.\nThis individual talked about the reality of teenagers.\nAnother person was impressed with this revenge.\nThat was a crazy revenge story!\nGood for them!\nWant to read another story where somebody got satisfying revenge?

    "title": "Major leaders laud ‘tit-for-tat’ strikes in Iran - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "• President Alvi says Pakistan will take ‘all necessary measures to defend its soil’ • Shehbaz praises nation for ‘fitting diplomatic, military steps’ • Zardari insists fraternal relations possible only on basis of equality ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership, including President Dr Arif Alvi and representatives from various parties, have commended the armed forces for retaliatory strikes in Iran, describing them as an inevitable action for national security. According to a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, President Alvi said Pakistan would not compromise on its national security and territorial integrity and would take “all necessary measures to defend its soil”. He lauded the professionalism of the armed forces of Pakistan that targeted the terrorist hideouts in the Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran, while avoiding the civilian casualties. The president said terrorism was a common challenge that required global efforts for its elimination. “Pakistan fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states and expects the same from other nations not to violate international law,” he added. He said Pakistan and Iran were brotherly countries and they needed to resolve issues through dialogue and mutual consultation. PML-N President and former premier Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the well-being of its citizens were paramount. “Pakistan has taken fitting diplomatic and military steps for peace and security. We seek peace between our two neighbourly countries but reserve the right to defend ourselves. The nation salutes our valiant armed forces for Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar,” he tweeted, referring to the operation under which Pakistan on Thursday morning struck militant hideouts in Iran. Former president and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari also insisted that any country that looked at Pakistan with ill intentions would be given a response accordingly. Mr Zardari said that Pakistan was a peace-loving country, but those who wish to target it should think a hundred times before doing so. “We have always advocated for peace around the globe and have prioritised it as well,” he said. “Pakistan Army is among the best in the world and our forces know how to defend the country, and we desire cordial and fraternal relations with our neighbours but only on the basis of equality.” The PTI also described the air strikes carried out by Pakistan as the right to self-defence. In a statement, Imran Khan’s party said it stood firmly with the armed forces in the face of any foreign aggression to defend and safeguard the motherland. It said that Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and security were of utmost importance, and no compromise would be made in this regard. JUI-F Central Secretary General Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri criticised the violation of Pakistani airspace by Iran and said that the action by Pakistan was the best possible move under the circumstances. “Iran is a neighbouring country, but it should not cross borders,” Maulana Haideri said. The Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PES) also appreciated the government and the armed forces for immediately responding to Iran’s hostile acts. “Iran’s missile and drone attacks inside Pakistan was not only an aggressive act and unprovoked violation of the country’s air space and international law but also a shocking diplomatic blunder committed by Iran which deflected the world’s attention from Israeli atrocities,” PES President Abdul Qayyum said at a press conference. Mr Qayyum, a retired lieutenant general, said Pakistan kept tracking Kulbhushan Jadhav’s movements in Iran for years but raided his hideout only when he was in Pakistan’s territory. “The TTP and BLA terrorists’ nests and training centres contiguous to our western borders both in Afghanistan and Iran could be struck by Pakistani security forces, but since it would have been a violation of international law, it was not done,” he said. The chief of Tehreek-i-Nafaz-i-Fiqh-i-Jafariya, Agha Syed Hussain Muqaddasi, declared Pakistan’s response to Iranian aggression as representative of the national aspirations and exhibition of unwavering resolve to defend the motherland. “Shias of Pakistan will prove to be a strong wall for the defence of each and every inch of the motherland,” he said in a statement. “Pakistan demonstrated the power of a responsible nuclear state,” he said, adding that Iran must not deviate from the path of Ayatollah Khomeini that the secret of success lies in the unity of Muslim countries.
