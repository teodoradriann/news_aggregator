    "text": "[ Shelagh Fogarty ](/radio/presenters/shelagh-fogarty/) 1pm - 4pm Suella slapped down: Home secretary rejects Braverman's claim 'Islamist cranks are in charge of Britain' 23 February 2024, 09:02 Watch Again: Nick Ferrari speaks to Home Secretary James Cleverly | 23/02 Home secretary James Cleverly has insisted he has not turned a \"blind eye\" to extremism after Suella Braverman claimed \"Islamist cranks\" have taken charge of Britain. Listen to this article Loading audio... \"From the river to the sea\", a chant viewed by some as calling for the destruction of Israel, was projected onto Big Ben on Wednesday night. Police were accused of standing by while it was beamed onto the landmark as Parliament descended into chaos during a vote on a Gaza ceasefire - sparked by fears over MPs' security, according to embattled speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Ms Braverman, [Mr Cleverly's](/politics/parties/conservatives/james-cleverly/) predecessor, wrote in the Telegraph: \"They started with the Jews; there were stern words of disapproval from the top but things only got worse. The Islamist cranks and Left-wing extremists then took control of the streets; the police looked meekly on.\" She added: \"Turning a blind eye to fanatics has got us into this terrible situation: it needs to stop.\" Responding on [LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast](/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/), Mr Cleverly said: \" [Suella](/politics/parties/conservatives/suella-braverman/) was close to this for a long time, she was Home Secretary. \"She's clearly expressing frustrations that she's felt while she was in this role, and I understand that… \"It is absolutely the case that we must crack down on extremist behaviour. It is absolutely the case that we must not let our democracy be distorted through fear or intimidation.\" He added that the government was giving \"more powers\" to the police and said: \"I certainly have not turned a blind eye since I've been home secretary.\" Read more: [Backlash aimed at police after divisive 'From the River to the Sea' slogan was projected onto Parliament](/news/backlash-aimed-at-police-after-divisive-from-the-river-to-the-sea-slogan-was-pro/) The messages projected onto Big Ben - or the Elizabeth Tower, as it is officially known - included \"Stop Bombing Gaza - Ceasefire Now\" and \"Stop Bombs\". But it was the \"river to the sea\" slogan that drew the most criticism - as has the Met's lack of action after months of criticism that it wasn't doing enough to clamp down on alleged anti-Semitic slogans and chants at pro-Palestine demos. The force said the projection, which was called \"genocidal language\" by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, had not broken any laws. \"This is a chant that has been frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations for many years and we are very aware of the strength of feeling in relation to it,\" a spokesperson said. \"While there are scenarios where chanting or using these words could be unlawful depending on the specific location or context, its use in a wider public protest setting, such as last night, is not a criminal offence.\" The demonstration came as a blazing row broke out in Parliament over the Gaza ceasefire vote. The SNP had tabled a motion calling for an immediate end to the fighting between [Israel and Hamas](/hot-topics/israel-gaza-attack/), which would \"stop the slaughter of innocent civilians\" in Gaza. It also made reference to the \"collective punishment\" of Palestinians, which would effectively accuse [Israel](/hot-topics/israel/) of a war crime. Their motion was put forward as part of the SNP's opposition day, where it gets to decide what is voted on. Labour had concerns about the wording but, amid fears some of its MPs could resign if compelled against voting for it, they tabled their own amendment instead calling for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\". Read more: [Keir Starmer denies threatening Commons speaker over Gaza ceasefire vote as embattled Hoyle vows to carry on](/news/keir-starmer-commons-speaker/) The government also tabled its own amendment. However, going against convention, Commons speaker Sir Lindsay accepted putting forward Labour's amendment for a vote. On opposition days, only government amendments are expected to be accepted. It led to a row as Sir Keir Starmer was forced to deny intimidating the speaker into accepting Labour's call for a ceasefire. Sir Lindsay said he did it so the \"the widest range of propositions on which to express a view\" could be heard, and also because he had become \"very, very concerned about the security of all members\" given the strength of public feeling about the conflict. By Friday morning, a motion of no confidence in the speaker had reached 68 signatures from MPs.",

    "text": "China has announced concrete measures in six areas to enhance support for the private economy, following previous measures rolled out in 2023 that saw private enterprises register high trade and investment growth.\nZheng Shanjie, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said on Tuesday that more pragmatic measures will be taken in six areas. He made the statement at a themed conference on the private economy's high-quality development, held in Jinjiang, east China's Fujian Province.\nThe six areas are as follows: accelerating the legislative process of the law on the promotion of the private economy; improving multi-level communications and exchanges and listening to the real voices of private enterprises; strengthening the analysis of the private economy's development; attracting more private capital to participate in major national engineering projects, such as railways and nuclear power, as well as in others covering energy, water facilities, and ecological and environmental protection; promulgating good practices and cases for mutual learning; and improving work mechanisms with a view to better serving the private economy's development.\nA series of policies to promote the development of the private economy was introduced in 2023. \"With the implementation of these policies and measures, the development of the private economy has shown a general trend of steady progress and steady improvement,\" Zheng said.\nGovernment data shows that from January to November 2023, the imports and exports of private enterprises increased by 6.1 percent year-on-year. Excluding investment in the real-estate sector, private investment increased by 9.1 percent year-on-year during the same period.",

Outra preocupação é o resgate de pessoas em situações análogas à escravidão, como explica a deputada estadual Dani Balbi, presidenta da Comissão de Trabalho da Alerj.\n“Nos comprometemos a construir fiscalizações mais contínuas e rigorosas, para que nós possamos interceptar e intervir quando observamos irregularidades como essa”.\nDesde a criação da central de denúncias, há pouco mais de um mês, foram registradas mais de 70 queixas, envolvendo temas como calor extremo no transporte público, principalmente em linhas de ônibus, além de escolas, comércios, com destaque para restaurantes, e outros equipamentos públicos.",

    "text": "Territorios Palestinos. El grupo Hezbolá anunció este jueves que bombardeó una base militar en el norte de Israel en respuesta a ataques que resultaron en la muerte de uno de sus combatientes , generando crecientes temores de una escalada bélica regional. El movimiento islamista proiraní indicó en un comunicado que lanzó “decenas de cohetes Katiusha” contra lo que describió como “la principal base de defensa aérea y antimisiles” en el norte de Israel, en represalia por dos bombardeos israelíes recientes. Uno de los ataques tuvo lugar el jueves en Sohmor, al este de Líbano, y el otro ocurrió el día anterior en Nabatiyé, al sur, donde cinco personas resultaron heridas. Hezbolá informó que uno de sus combatientes murió en el bombardeo de Sohmor, durante el cual, según la Agencia Nacional de Información libanesa (AIN), un dron israelí disparó contra un motociclista en esa localidad. El ejército israelí confirmó que “eliminó” a un miembro de Hezbolá en un ataque aéreo en la región de Sohmor y que sus aviones de combate atacaron “estructuras militares” en el sur de Líbano. El movimiento chiita, aliado de Hamás en Gaza, también reportó otros dos ataques el jueves contra posiciones militares israelíes, incluyendo uno con drones. En paralelo, la ANI reportó ataques israelíes en el sur de Líbano. El ejército israelí mencionó que dos drones procedentes del Líbano cayeron en el norte de Israel sin causar víctimas. Desde el inicio el 7 de octubre de la guerra de Gaza entre Israel y Hamás, la frontera entre Líbano e Israel es escenario casi diario de enfrentamientos de artillería, intensificando los temores de una conflagración regional. El miércoles, el jefe de Asuntos Humanitarios de la ONU, Martin Griffiths, advirtió sobre el riesgo “potencialmente apocalíptico” de que la guerra de Gaza se extienda al Líbano. El ministro de Defensa israelí, Yoav Gallant, declaró en Washington el miércoles que Israel no busca una guerra en Líbano, pero advirtió que podría llevar al país “a la Edad de Piedra” si fracasa la diplomacia. Francia expresó el jueves su profunda preocupación por la gravedad de la situación en Líbano y urgió a todas las partes a ejercer “la mayor moderación”. Desde el inicio de los enfrentamientos entre Hezbolá y el ejército israelí hace más de ocho meses, se registraron al menos 482 muertes en el Líbano, la mayoría de ellos combatientes del movimiento islamista, así como 94 civiles, según un recuento de esta agencia. Del lado israelí, al menos 15 soldados y 11 civiles perdieron la vida, según datos de Israel.",

    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to move top of the Premier League after losing 2-0 to London rivals West Ham United on Thursday night. Premier League Result: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham United Date: 28 December 2023 Venue: Emirates Stadium The Gunners made one change from the 1-1 draw with Liverpool, as Kai Havertz missed out through suspension and was replaced by Leandro Trossard whiel Declan Rice lined up against his former side. The home side did all the dominating early on but it was West Ham who broke the deadlock on 13 minutes when Tomas Soucek fired home from close range from Jarrod Bowen's cross. The Hammers were dealt a blow after 30 minutes as star midfielder Lucas Paqueta, who had bagged five assists in his last two games, was forced off with an injury and replaced Said Benrahma. Arsenal pushed for an equaliser and were unlucky not to have equalised minutes before the break when Martin Odegaard played in Bukayo Saka, who saw his strike crash against the upright. It got better for West Ham ten minutes into the second half when former Gunners defender Konstantinos Mavropanos got ahead of his marker to nod home a cross from James Ward-Prowse. Gunners manager Mikel Arteta responded with a double change soon after as Gabriel Martinelli and Oleksandr Zinchenko made way for Eddie Nketiah and Reis Nelson for the final 25 minutes. Try as they may, there was no back into the contest for the home side who only troubled Hammers goalkeeper Alphonse Areola with efforts from distance as they struggled in the 18-yard area. The Hammers had a chance to bag a third goal in second-half stoppage time after Rice gave away a penalty, but Benrahma saw his spot-kick saved by David Raya as two goals were enough to hand Arsenal their first home defeat of the campaign.
