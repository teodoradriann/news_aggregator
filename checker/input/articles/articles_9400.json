    "text": "SHELBY — [The Shelby Foundation](https://www.theshelbyfoundation.org/) is taking bold steps to make Shelby shine even brighter. With unanimous support, the Foundation’s Board of Directors proceeded on Thursday to purchase the former Dick’s Furniture Building (62 and 64 West Main St.), the current Sutter’s Home Decorating Building (70 and 72 West Main St.), and the parcel located directly behind at 65 Wall St. After listening to donors, business owners and other citizens, the Board developed a strategic plan that concentrates on building an attractive, strong and secure community. Areas of strategic focus include growth and sustainability, city revitalization, quality of life and economic development. By investing in Shelby’s downtown buildings, every aspect of the strategic plan is touched upon. “The Shelby Foundation supports our local nonprofits and infuses them with needed support, and the Foundation will continue to do this,” said Carrie Kemerer, executive director of the Foundation. “However, the Foundation’s impact is for every person who has walked up and down Main Street, who has a business here, who has come here for dinner and walked in our parks, and, importantly, everyone who hasn’t yet but will. The positive effects from the Foundation should be felt by everyone.” Over the years, the Board of Directors has had many conversations about investing in downtown, but when this opportunity presented itself, the timing was right. With so many wonderful things happening in the Shelby community, it was a now or never decision, and the Board asked, “If not us, then who?” Forward momentum Board chair, Dr. Marissa Miller, shared her appreciation to Mr. Dennis Pitsch, Mr. Randy Sampsel, and Mr. and Mrs. John Weaver. “They want what is best for Shelby, and, by partnering with the Foundation, they are doing just that,” Miller said. “They are contributing to the forward momentum that will ultimately result in generational change. “There are so many wonderful things taking place in our community: A new school campus, Black Fork Commons Plaza, new businesses, and the list goes on and on,” she continued. “With these positive changes happening, this is another area for the Foundation to invest in and make a real difference in the future of Shelby.” Shelby Foundation wants investment to ‘be visible’ Location and historical significance were two factors when determining which buildings to purchase. It made sense to acquire and improve real estate on the most heavily trafficked intersection in Shelby. The Board wanted their investment to be visible and is confident it will spur others to join them in this revitalization effort. The Dick’s Furniture Building and Sutter’s Home Decorating Building are in the heart of the historic district. According to the original 1834 Shelby Town Plat map, these two buildings are situated on Lot #1. The lots have been reconfigured over the years, but Lot #1 was the first block created when “the town of Shelby” was laid out. “It is a clever coincidence that the original block in Shelby and The Shelby Foundation are now connected in this way. Both the location and the Foundation represent legacy and permanence. It was as if this was always meant to be,” said Kemerer. Next steps: Revitalization and purpose The first step for the Foundation Board was to acquire the buildings. Now that this step is completed, the Board’s focus can turn to revitalization and purpose. “There are a lot of unknowns regarding improvements and end use, but as we make decisions, we will share our plans. In the meantime, we hope the community is just as excited as we are about this news,” Kemerer said. Shelby Mayor Steve Schag shared his enthusiasm for the Foundation’s enormous investment. “This is another example of why the city of Shelby is so blessed,” he said. “There is so much positive momentum happening here, and it is noticed by other municipalities around the county. “The city is thankful to The Shelby Foundation for their bold actions, and we cannot wait to see the end result.” What's the impact of our reporting?

    "text": "Crianças e adolescentes até 14 anos formam a população mais afetada pelo aumento de casos de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SRAG) causada por gripe, covid-19 e vírus sincicial respiratório (VSR) , segundo alerta do novo Boletim InfoGripe da Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) divulgado nesta quinta-feira, 20. A alta tem relação com a volta às aulas e a entidade recomenda que a população infantojuvenil fique em casa ou saia usando máscaras ao apresentar sintomas gripais.\nOs dados são referentes ao período de 9 a 15 de fevereiro e mostram que, no grupo até 2 anos de idade , os episódios de SRAG foram causados principalmente pelo VSR, causador de bronquiolite e pneumonia . Nesta semana, o Ministério da Saúde anunciou a incorporação de uma vacina e de um medicamento para a condição.\n“Na faixa etária de crianças e adolescentes, onde a gente tem observado aumento de SRAG desde a semana passada, de modo geral, o crescimento de casos de SRAG está relacionado a volta às aulas, quando as crianças passam mais tempo em ambientes fechados e em maior contato, favorecendo a transmissão dos vírus respiratórios”, explicou, em comunicado, Tatiana Portella , pesquisadora do Programa de Computação Científica da Fiocruz e do Boletim InfoGripe.\nA análise mostrou ainda que os casos de covid-19 têm aumentado entre os idosos, população que deve ser vacinada a cada seis meses , de acordo com a nova estratégia anunciada pelo Ministério da Saúde em dezembro do ano passado.\nRecomendações para as crianças e adolescentes Com a circulação de vírus, é importante manter o esquema vacinal em dia , lavar as mãos e evitar o contato com pessoas que estão com sintomas gripais.\nContinua após a publicidade No caso do VSR, é fundamental que as pessoas que vão visitar bebês evitem beijar as mãos, porque eles levam à boca, e se aproximar demais. Caso esteja gripado, o ideal é adiar a visita.\n“No caso das crianças e adolescentes, a gente recomenda que os pais ou cuidadores que evitem levar as crianças para a escola, caso elas apresentem algum sintoma de síndrome gripal. Se não for possível fazer esse isolamento com a criança e não tiver ninguém que possa cuidar dela dentro de casa até ela se recuperar, a gente recomenda que a criança ou adolescente vá para escola usando uma boa máscara, se for possível”, diz a pesquisadora.\nVacina contra VSR foi incorporada no SUS Na última segunda-feira, 17, o Ministério da Saúde anunciou a incorporação no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) de duas estratégias para combater o VSR : o anticorpo monoclonal nirsevimabe, indicado para proteger bebês prematuros e crianças de até 2 anos nascidas com comorbidades, e a vacina recombinante contra os vírus sinciciais respiratórios A e B, , dada em gestantes para proteger os bebês nos primeiros meses de vida.\nContinua após a publicidade A vacina contra o vírus causador da bronquiolite foi aprovada no Brasil em abril de 2024 e deve ser aplicada entre a 24ª e a 36ª semanas de gestação.\nCompartilhe essa matéria via:\nPublicidade",

    "text": "Noticias relacionadas Málaga da la bienvenida a agosto con la temperatura más alta de Andalucía y España: Álora supera los 44 grados Málaga empezará agosto con avisos amarillos y naranjas por altas temperaturas: se superarán los 40 grados Fugaz tormenta de verano en Málaga: lluvia y barro en diferentes zonas de la provincia El calor no da tregua estos días en Málaga. Las temperaturas durante esta mañana de viernes han llegado a los 40 grados en algunas zonas , sobre todo de la costa, según los datos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología. Tal es el calor, que Málaga ha marcado en esta primera parte del día ocho de las diez temperaturas más altas a nivel nacional.\nEl aviso naranja por calor está activo en las comarcas de Axarquía, Costa del Sol y en el Valle del Guadalhorce. Este aviso permanecerá activo hasta las 21.00 horas, y se espera que los termómetros pueden llegar a superar los 40 grados a lo largo del día.\nLos termómetros están ardiendo y no hacen más que marcar las temperaturas más altas del país en diferentes puntos de la provincia. De esta manera, esta mañana, a las 11.00 horas, en Rincón de la Victoria han llegado a los 40,2 grados y un rato más tarde, a las 12.40 horas en Vélez-Málaga estaban a 40,4 grados . En Algarrobo a las 11.50 horas han llegado a los 38,5 grados.\nEn el caso de la capital , las temperaturas más altas de esta primera parte de la jornada han oscilado entre los 39 y los 38 grados , marcando sobre las 13.00 horas 38,8 y 38,2 grados en el Centro Meteorológico y en el Puerto y alcanzando los 39,8 grados en el Aeropuerto.\nPor otro lado, en Torremolinos estaban a 38,6 grados también a las 13.00 horas y a esa misma hora en Coín han llegado a los 37,7 grados.\nPor ello, el 112 incide en que es fundamental beber agua de forma periódica, cada dos horas como máximo, incluso aunque no se tenga sensación de sed. También sostienen que hay que prestar una especial atención a personas mayores , enfermos crónicos y niños pequeños. Además, recomiendan las comidas ligeras, frías y frescas, con alto contenido acuoso, evitando las copiosas y muy calientes.\nDe igual forma, aconsejan durante las horas centrales del día cerrar bien las ventanas, cortinas y persianas más expuestas al sol y usar el ventilador o el aire acondicionado. Asimismo, remarcan que se debe evitar salir a la calle en las horas de más calor , y cuando haya que salir usar protección solar, sombrero o gorra y gafas de sol homologadas para protegerse del sol. Es mejor vestir con ropas claras y de tejidos ligeros y llevar siempre una botella de agua, también en los desplazamientos en coche, para permanecer hidratados.",
