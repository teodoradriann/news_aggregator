    "title": "'Light in the darkness' bishops' Christmas messages reflect on 'year of despair'",
    "text": "Church of England bishops have used their Christmas messages to reflect on a \"year of darkness and despair\", reminding Christians that \"God is with us, whatever we have to face and whatever life may bring.\" They speak of hope and peace in the Christmas story, and the true joy it brings, even at a time of huge challenges – from the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to loss and hardship in the UK amid the cost-of-living crisis. The Bishop of London, Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally, speaks of a “distressing” year of conflicts across the globe, tearing people from their homes and separating them from loved ones: “The story on which we build our faith does not speak of hope whilst ignoring suffering. It speaks of hope into that suffering. It speaks of light in darkness. “Through the sheer vulnerability and yet the extraordinary tenacity of a new-born baby, it speaks of the cost and the risk of God’s utter commitment to the world and its people.” In his message, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, Rt Rev Michael Beasley, said: \"As we look at the world around us at the close of this year, it’s important to remember that Jesus came to be with us not just for the good times, but for the difficult too. \"Jesus is ‘God with us’ everywhere – in trenches in Ukraine, bomb shelters in Israel and Gaza, in hospital wards where loved ones die, in relationships where there is conflict and distress. The baby born in Bethlehem stands with us in all that we experience.\" In a video message, the Bishop of Gloucester, Rt Rev Rachel Treweek, spoke of the suffering inflicted by conflict, poverty, famine and natural disasters on children across the world: “With God one day there will be no more crying – no more pain, no more death. Even now God longs to hold us – as children. Longs for us to cry ‘yes’ and to stretch out our hands to God and to each other. May it be so.” The Bishop of St Albans, Rt Rev Alan Smith, spoke of the \"deep shadows\" cast by the conflict in Gaza and the war in Ukraine: \"Jesus teaches us that the journey to peace starts not with somebody else, but with each one of us. “He calls us to self-examination and penitence and invites us to embrace a way of living whose hallmarks are integrity, generosity and mutual respect.” In his message, the Bishop of Rochester, Rt Rev Jonathan Gibbs, says: “The message of the angels was that a Saviour had been born whose name was Immanuel, which means ‘God is with us’. “This is the heart of the Christmas message: that God is with us, whatever we have to face and whatever life may bring. “God has entered into our world to draw near to us – and He invites us to receive him into our lives, so that we may know for ourselves His love and joy and peace. “That message is as relevant today as it has ever been – and perhaps even more so today with all the challenges that we are facing.” The Bishop of Chelmsford, Rt Rev Guli Francis-Dehqani, says: “At Christmas we remember the astonishing fact that, in the birth of Jesus Christ, God came to dwell with us, to make His home among us. The events of the first Christmas are rooted in a particular time and place, but God’s presence abides still and the invitation to draw near remains for each one of us.” Meanwhile the Bishop of Loughborough, Rt Rev Saju Muthalaly, speaks of joy “even when things aren't going our way, even when times are rough.” “Joy is not something that we acquire, buy, manufacture, or entertain ourselves into this Christmas,” he says. “It is what we receive from what we open ourselves up to God in His Son, Jesus Christ.” The Bishop of Salisbury, Rt Rev Stephen Lake, filmed a message partly in a food bank, which is seeing rising demand. He says: “It’s a very different Christmas this year with so much of concern in our world. And it’s into that world that Jesus Christ is born, the word made flesh, God with us. And for me, that’s what makes Christmas real and meaningful – that God came to us and shares our life. “And in many ways, it’s just as simple as that.”",

    "text": "During his recent\npodcast appearance with ON3, Kirby Smart might have taken a subtle jibe at Deion Sanders and Co. With all the Cormani McClain drama unfolding for the past few months, right from when he alleged them “to be playing for clicks” to him committing to Gators to highlighting the “cultural” loopholes in Colorado.\nBeing the head coach of one of the top seeds of CFB, Kirby Smart took a smart, camouflaged shot at Deion Sanders-Cormani McClain drama by speaking of his recruitment strategy. “First question we ask is why did you go in the portal? And I sit back and listen. If it’s blank blame, all the coaches, all them, I’m really not interested. Because that then would become me at the new place. I want to hear them out and kind of hear what their reasoning is and when they have good reasoning for why they’re leaving, they fit kind of the the unselfish culture we try to promote,” Smart said, throwing indirect shade at Deion Sanders while promoting the ‘unselfish culture’ of his program.\nThis is a developing story. Stay tuned for further updates.",

Crédito: @victoriaruffo31, X Victoria Ruffo ha estado ausente del ojo público desde hace algunos días cuando ofreció declaraciones a la prensa sobre su estado de salud, pues trascendió la noticia de que se había ausentado de sus compromisos profesionales por motivos de salud.\nLa primera en hablar sobre la situación que atraviesa la “Queen de las telenovelas” fue Mara Patricia Castañeda , quien compartió para los micrófonos del programa “Hoy” que su compañera se había ausentado por problemas de salud.\nDías después, la actriz de melodramas como “ La Madrastra ” y “ Corona de lágrimas ” compartió con distintos medios que enfrentaba problemas en las vías respiratorias, pero no se trataba de nada grave.\nLa actriz sigue ausente de la obra \"Las Leonas\". Crédito: IG, victoriaruffo Sin embargo, días después de aquellas declaraciones su salud ha vuelto a ser tema de conversación, pues por segunda vez no se presentó en la obra de teatro, así lo dio a conocer el periodista Gustavo Adolfo Infante :\n“Espero que Victoria esté bien; el fin de semana no estuvo en la obra de teatro”.\nAsimismo, otra de las situaciones que llamó la atención fueron las especulaciones de que la actriz no se presentó a la celebración de cumpleaños de su nieta Tessa , pues no aparece en las fotos y videos que circulan en Internet; sin embargo, sí felicitó a la pequeña a través de su cuenta personal de Instagram.\nVictoria Ruffo debutó como abuela y compartió su alegría por el primer año de vida de Tessa (IG) ¿Cuáles son los problemas de salud que enfrenta Victoria Ruffo? La actriz valora la posibilidad de consultar a un alergólogo ante la persistencia de síntomas como la tos intensa y el dolor de garganta. Ruffo relató que los exámenes ya realizados sugieren que podría tratarse de un cuadro alérgico y no de una infección común, razón por la cual busca determinar con exactitud el origen de su afección para encontrar un remedio efectivo.\n“He estado enferma un poco de la garganta, pero fíjate que ya me revisaron y resulta que es como mucha alergia, puede ser a cualquier cosa“, comentó.\nDe igual forma, también manifestó su intención de someterse a estudios específicos para detectar alergias: ”Hay una cosa que te hacen para ver lo de las alergias; me la voy a hacer para ver a qué soy alérgica y combatirlo porque traigo una tos impresionante y mucho dolor de garganta, de repente se me desarrolla como una gripe“, explicó.\nY aunque ha recurrido a remedios caseros con el objetivo de aliviar la tos, hasta el momento no ha encontrado mejoría significativa en sus síntomas. “Ya no aguanto el tórax de tanta tos“ , afirmó.",

    "title": "Notre Dame swimming controversy, explained: Men's team suspended for 2024-25 season for betting on races | Sporting News Canada",
    "text": "Gambling continues to leave an imprint on the world of professional and college sports. The latest controversy hit college swimming. Sports betting companies, including DraftKings and FanDuel, are changing the economic ecosystem of college sports. Fans can see the impact. Gambling advertisements litter the airwaves during sporting events, with Kevin Hart, Jamie Foxx, J.B. Smoove and others enlisted to convince audiences to empty their pockets in pursuit of the money line. The legalization and subsequent rise of sports betting also has been accompanied by heightened rates of gambling addiction in young men, as Newsweek reported in 2023 and as Siena College found in a 2024 survey . The Notre Dame men's swimming team found this out the hard way. Numerous athletes have been mired in gambling controversy over the past year, including Premier League players Ivan Toney , Sandro Tonali and Lucas Paqueta , former NBA player Jontay Porter and former MLB player Tucupita Marcano . So too have collegiate programs, from Alabama baseball to Iowa football to Temple basketball . Notre Dame is the latest school to be hit with a sports betting scandal. The Irish athletic department is suspending the men's swimming team for a minimum of one year after finding that athletes violated NCAA rules in regards to gambling. Sports Illustrated's Pat Forde was the first to report on the findings. Here's a look at the details behind the program's lengthy ban. Notre Dame swimming controversy, explained Concerns regarding the culture within Notre Dame's men's swimming team surfaced towards the end of the 2023-24 season, prompting Notre Dame to conduct its own internal review of the program. In late June, the school hired private law firm Ropes & Gray to conduct a separate external investigation on the team. The final findings of Ropes & Gray's review were unveiled this week. Notre Dame's men's swim team effectively created its own sportsbook, per reports. Swimmers placed bets on their performances in the pool, with the team crafting \"over/under\" lines for swimmer's times during various events. Wagers would be placed based on the outcome of different races, as well. Most of the swimmers returning to the team for the 2024-25 season are believed to have participated in the betting. \"The external review confirmed and expanded on our initial concerns,\" athletic director Pete Bevacqua said. \"These findings are contrary to the University’s values and all that we stand for in Notre Dame athletics. \"In order to ensure that this behavior ends and to rebuild a culture of dignity, respect, and exemplary conduct, we have decided to suspend the men’s swimming program for at least one academic year. While individual conduct varied, the overwhelming cultural dynamic on the team necessitates a full suspension.\" Neither the women's swimming nor the men's and women's diving teams were affected by Thursday's announcement. The timing of Thursday's announcement is notable. Forde reported that athletes wishing to transfer — including incoming freshmen — should have free rein to do so before the start of classes on Aug. 27. Head coach Chris Lindauer and his staff weren't disciplined, with the investigations finding that “the staff was not aware of gambling or the scope and extent of other troubling behaviors because team members effectively concealed such behaviors from the coaches and staff through concerted efforts.” Those found to have committed gambling infractions will face sanctions even if they depart for other schools, Forde reported. Some Notre Dame swimmers were found to have bet on other sports and schools. Those wagers carry less severe penalties than the prospect of gambling on one's own sport. The team were also found to have cultivated a team culture that Bevacqua called \"dismissive of Notre Dame’s standards for student-athletes.” Much of that claim stemmed from a group chat among men's team members. Per Bevacqua, teammates did not \"treat one another with dignity and respect.\" There was no evidence of any physical abuse within the team. Thursday's announcement could have dire implications for Lindauer, who led the Irish to their first-ever top-10 finish at the NCAA championships. The program also sent its first men's swimmer to the Olympics in freestyler Chris Guiliano. Guiliano competed in the 50m, 100m and 200m freestyles. He also featured on the U.S.'s gold medal-winning 400m freestyle relay team. Guiliano isn't believed to be one of the swimmers who wagered on his team. “As stated at the launch of the review, we take seriously our obligation to foster a community of student-athletes who not only compete and perform at the highest level academically and athletically, but whose conduct reflects the University’s values,” Bevacqua said. “We hope this decision sends a clear and unequivocal message reaffirming that commitment and expectation.” NCAA sports betting policy Here's a look at the NCAA's current set of guidelines on athlete betting: Wagers of $200 or less: Sports wagering rules and prevention education. Wagers from $201-$500: Loss of 10% of a season of eligibility, plus rules and prevention education. Wagers from $501-$800: Loss of 20% of a season of eligibility, plus rules and prevention education. Wagers greater than $800: Loss of 30% of a season of eligibility, plus rules and prevention education. For cumulative wagering activities that greatly exceed $800, NCAA reinstatement staff are directed to consider whether additional loss of eligibility, including permanent ineligibility, are appropriate.",
