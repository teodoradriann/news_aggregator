    "title": "Traditional power Gonzaga eases into NCAA tourney prep for Georgia: 'This is easy for us'",
    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. — Gonzaga players believe they have a built-in advantage over Georgia in the teams’ opening round matchup in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament on Thursday.\n“We’ve been here before,” Zags’ redshirt senior Graham Ike said on Wednesday, previewing the teams’ 4:35 p.m. Thursday match up (TV: TBS).\n“So we have the experience, we’re kind of used to these kind of games and environments. I think it does help us.”\nCoach Mike White’s UGA program is making its first NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament appearance in 10 years when it tips off against a tradition-rich Gonzaga program that has the longest active streak of Sweet 16 appearances in the nation (nine).\nWhite, who has a string of four-straight NCAA tournament opening round wins carrying over from his time as head coach at Florida (2015-22), said it could take his UGA players a few minutes to get the feel of the so-called “Big Dance” environment.\n“Until you actually play in it, I’m not sure that your guys will fully feel it, right?” White said, asked by AJC-DawgNation at his Wednesday press session in INTRUST Bank Arena about UGA’s lack of NCAA tournament experience.\n“I think the first media timeout they will have felt it, and we will have to respond to some positives and to some negatives throughout the game, but this group has done that,” White said. “Now it’s time to do it on the biggest stage.”\nGeorgia won three do-or-die postseason games in the NIT last season, besting basketball schools Xavier and Wake Forest before taking down Big Ten power Ohio State on the road.\nBut the NIT is different, White knows, in terms of the level of competition and the bright lights shining down on the court.\nThe Gonzaga players know and understand the value of the school name on their chest, too, and the values for success that have carried over under the sixth-winningest head coach in college basketball, Mark Few.\n“I think our culture just starts with who we are as a program, the tradition in the Gonzaga program,” said NCAA assists leader and Zags’ single-season record-holder Ryan Nembhard, who transferred to the Spokane, Wash., school from Creighton before the 2023-24 season.\n“I think the culture here is second to none, you know, that’s built through years of different teams, camaraderie, and especially the way Coach Few is just so consistent every year and eery day on what he brings to the table,” he said. “So I think the culture is in us.”\nGeorgia is trying to build a successful basketball culture and change the narrative around a program that has little tradition.\nThe Bulldogs have not won an NCAA tournament game since 2002 — later vacated due to NCAA sanctions — and have won just one SEC regular season title and two SEC tournament titles in school history.\nGeorgia lost to Michigan State, another traditional basketball powerhouse, in its most recent NCAA tourney appearance by a 70-63 count on March 20, 2015, in Charlotte, N.C.\nArriving for NCAA tourney pregame festivities in Wichita was, no doubt, different for the Bulldogs from other venues.\nThe open locker room and elevated stage media press conferences were unique to the NCAA tournament, as was having fans surrounding the basketball court during the Bulldogs’ Wednesday shoot-around session.\nGonzaga shooting guard Nolan Hickman, a first-team All-West Coast Conference selection, shared how casual it feels for himself and his NCAA tourney-tested teammates.\n“With us being here already, I think this is something that’s usual, and it’s easy for us,” Hickman said. “We understand how this thing goes, so I think that’s pretty much the difference between newcomers and us seniors that have been in it for a while.”\nIke agreed.\n“I think for newcomers, like when you get in, I feel something that can be new for them is maybe the highs and lows of March Madness,” Ike said. “Not getting too high, not getting loo low, but just trying to stay in the middle with it …. \"\nFew, one of the most-respected and well-liked coaches in collegiate basketball history, doesn’t get too carried away with the value of the tradition he has built.\n“It’s always nice to have experience,” Few said, “but it’s going to come down to that 40 minutes of basketball, and who’s making plays and getting stops, and who isn’t.”\nIndeed, Nembhard stressed the ultimate difference in who wins the Georgia-Gonzaga game on Thursday could come down to hunger.\n“If you’re not desperate at this time of year, you’re going on,” Nembhard said. “Win or go home at this point, and your season is done, so you have to be desperate.\n“The least desperate team is probably going to be going home and chilling on the couch.”",

    "text": "Abkhaz veteran supports Georgian protesters\nIn Abkhazia , Lasha Zukhba, a veteran of the Georgian-Abkhaz war of 1992-93 , who was awarded the highest military honor of the republic, expressed support for the protest actions against the “ foreign agents bill ” in the capital of Georgia on his Facebook page. Due to this, the pro-government veteran party of Abkhazia, “Amtsakhara,” condemned him, while the opposition, on the contrary, criticized “Amtsakhara” for its “selective approach.”\nGeneration Z protest: Who's leading the frontline against the 'Russian law' in Georgia. Video In this video, we explain what Generation Z is protesting against and how they self-organize to defend their rights\n“I express solidarity with the protesters in Tbilisi, the Georgian opposition, and the entire civil society of Georgia in their protest against the adoption of the foreign influence law. We remember your support for our protest against the Pitsunda agreement, and the protest against the foreign agents bill still awaits us ahead.\nI hope your efforts will not be in vain and the bill will not be passed. I am confident that people, especially the Georgian people, are unbeatable in their determination. I wish you strength of spirit and success in achieving your goal,” wrote Lasha Zukhba on Facebook.\nThis post sparked intense debate in the Abkhaz segment of social media. Mostly, Lasha Zukhba was criticized for his support of the Georgian protest, but there were also those who defended him, emphasizing the veteran’s military merits.\nExploiting ideological division: Opinion on transfer of Pitsunda estate to Russia Society in Abkhazia against the agent law – who said what Kremlin offers Georgia territorial integrity for “foreign agents” law? Opinion from Abkhazia The pro-government veteran party of veterans “Amtsakhara” called on its colleagues and opposition political forces to give a moral assessment of Lasha Zukhba’s words, almost accusing him of preparing similar protests in Abkhazia:\n“How can a citizen of Abkhazia and a veteran of the Patriotic War in Abkhazia express solidarity with the supporters of Mikhail Saakashvili, who unleashed the war in 2008, supporters of the ideology of extreme nationalism, rejecting the very idea of Abkhaz statehood, independence, and sovereignty, supporters of an ideology hostile to the Abkhaz people?\nSecondly, citizen Zukhba, on his own behalf and on behalf of his supporters, thanks Georgian nationalists for supporting protests against the Pitsunda agreement. Opposition forces in Abkhazia criticized the Pitsunda agreement, but what was the nature of this support?\nThirdly, citizen Zukhba announces future protests against the adoption of the foreign agents bill by the Parliament of the Republic of Abkhazia. Does this mean that protests in Tbilisi and future protests in Abkhazia are coordinated from the same center? And finally, a question to citizen Zukhba personally: who are your like-minded people?”\nIn turn, another opposition veteran organization, “Aruaa,” stated that it does not support Lasha Zukhba’s statement, but nevertheless, it is surprised by the accusations from “Amtsakhara,” considering them a display of double standards.\n“Aruaa” provides its list of Georgia-related issues to which “Amtsakhara” did not react:\nThe covert trip to Georgian territory by Abkhazia’s Minister of Economy, Christina Ozgan. Lifting the ban on trade relations with Georgia. The visit of Georgian parliament deputies to Abkhazia, and so on. “We hold the veteran of the Patriotic War of the People of Abkhazia of 1992-1993, Lasha Zukhba, in high esteem for his combat merits and remind ‘Amtsakhara’ that he was an active supporter of the current government, supporting president Aslan Bzhania during the 2020 presidential elections.\nIn conclusion, we demand that ‘Amtsakhara’ provide a moral assessment, first and foremost, of the aforementioned actions of the ruling authorities,” stated “Aruaa.”",

Officials have distributed millions of pieces of protective equipment to high-risk dairy farm workers and launched multilingual outreach programs.\nState authorities are working with federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the US Department of Agriculture to monitor potential cases.\nThe state is also providing dairy workers with additional doses of seasonal flu vaccine to reduce concurrent flu risks, officials said.",

    "text": "A través de un comunicado, el Centro de Predicción del Clima Espacial (SWPC, en inglés) de la Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, en inglés), una división del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, alertó de esta particular situación, de la que se ofrecerán más detalles en las próximas horas.Las tormentas geomagnéticas, según explican, pueden tener impacto en la infraestructura orbital terrestre y en la superficie de la Tierra con el potencial de interferir con las comunicaciones, la red de energía eléctrica, la navegación y las operaciones de radio y de satélites. (Puede leer: En fotos: la Nasa mostró cuál es el verdadero color del océano).La serie de erupciones comenzó el 8 de mayo y las condiciones para que la tormenta persista podrían durar durante todo el fin de semana. \"Una gran mancha solar ha producido erupciones desde moderadas a muy fuertes desde el miércoles\", señaló la agencia. \"Al menos cinco de esas erupciones estuvieron asociadas con eyecciones de masa de la corona solar que parecen dirigidas hacia la Tierra\".(Además: La sonda china Chang'e 6 entra en la órbita lunar: ¿en qué consiste su misión?).Estas eyecciones son explosiones de plasma y campos magnéticos en la corona solar que causan tormentas geomagnéticas cuando ocurren en dirección a la Tierra, explicó NOAA.La gran mancha solar ha lanzado una secuencia asombrosa de cinco eyecciones de masa solar hacia la Tierra, según la plataforma Spacewather.com, que estima que, si se tratara de un huracán, sería de categoría 4.​​EFE",
