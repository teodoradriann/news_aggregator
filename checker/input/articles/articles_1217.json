    "text": "Kalaburagi, Feb 23 (IANS): A police complaint was filed on Friday against two nurses by the Hindu Jagruthi Sene for attempting religious conversion here.\nThe incident was reported from the government-run Primary Health and Welfare Centre at Ratkal village in Kalagi taluk. The complaint was registered against Ashwini and Rubika, both nurses.\nThe Hindu Jagruthi Sene has stated in the complaint that the accused nurses were offering money and converting people to Christianity. After getting a tip-off, the members of Sene went to the spot and questioned the nurses.\n“They had invited religious preachers to the premises of the hospital and preached the Bible. The accused are indulging in religious conversion and creating communal unrest in the village.\n\"Being government staffers, instead of treating all patients without being bothered about their religion, the nurses were indulging in spreading propaganda against Hindu religion among the people in the hospital and indulging in religious conversion,” the complaint stated.\nThe Hindu Jagruti Sene members had intimated the police about the development when they questioned the nurses. The Ratkal police have registered the case.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.

    "title": "Gregg County approves benefits change aimed at helping recruit employees | Local News | news-journal.com",
    "text": "A change in benefits for new employees is designed to help Gregg County recruit employees.\nCommissioners on Thursday approved a change that gives new employees earlier access to medical and dental insurance.\nDawn Brinson of Brinson Benefits explained that her company worked with the county’s benefits committee to bring recommendations for two changes to commissioners.\nNew employees’ medical and dental benefits didn’t kick in until the first day of the month after 60 days. The proposal commissioners agreed to changes that to the first day of the month after 30 days.\n“This particular recommendation is our effort to help with recruiting for new hires to the county,” Brinson said. “In any given year we’re filling about 100 to 120 positions here.”\nThe county has 70 open positions, she said.\nThe 60-day waiting period sometimes meant people actually weren’t eligible for benefits for almost 90 days.\nIf the county hires 100 people in a year, the cost to the county would be about $90,000 a year, Brinson said.\nGregg County Judge Bill Stoudt supported the change, which was unanimously approved by commissioners.\nSign Up for Newsletters Email* Select Newsletters to Sign Up For News Updates Breaking News Sports Digest Obituaries and Death Notices Submit “This year, we’ve been trying to address the pay and other benefits to employees to be competitive,” he said. “This is just another move to be competitive in the marketplace.”\nPct. 3 Commissioner Floyd Wingo said he believes in the “recruitment value” of the change, saying one of the most common questions applicants ask is about when their benefits begin.\nCommissioners on Thursday also approved a benefits change that makes it possible for employees to sometimes pay nothing for prescriptions. The incentive they approved gives employees a discount of $10 on prescriptions that are filled at locally owned independent pharmacies in Gregg County. Brinson said her company has identified nine such pharmacies.\nThe county’s prescription plan has four tiers with co-pays that range from $10 to $100, which means that employees might sometimes avoid a co-pay with the new benefit. Brinson estimates the change would cost the county about $30,000 a year, based on an estimate that about 20% of prescriptions would be filled at qualifying pharmacies.\nIn other business Thursday, in a vote to renew the annual lease agreement for the space the veterans service office occupies at 1204-A East Marshall Ave., county officials discussed what would happen when a new parking garage that will include county office space is completed. The veterans office will relocate to that office space.\nVoters in November approved a debt proposal that will allow the county to borrow up to $19 million to build the new parking garage on property the county already owns across from the courthouse in downtown Longview. Stout had said he expects the county will provide $10 million in cash to the project, which would means the county wouldn’t haven’t to borrow the whole $19 million.\nStoudt said after Thursday’s meeting that the contractor, Houston-based SpawGlass, is working on finalizing the cost of the parking garage. He expects that final cost would be ready in February or March, at which point the county would determine how much debt it would actually need to issue for the parking garage. Construction could start in April, and the county has said it will take about 18 months to complete.\nStoudt warned that the project will disrupt traffic in downtown, considering construction and staging of supplies and equipment. He said the county is working with the city of Longview on those details.",

    "title": "Disputed claims of leaky Big Sky wastewater ponds resurface | County | bozemandailychronicle.com",
    "text": "An admission by the Big Sky Water and Sewer District that officials estimated data in 2020 used to decide litigation has revived allegations that their holding ponds are leaking.\nFor years, Bozeman’s Cottonwood Environmental Law Firm has said the three ponds are leaking far more than the amount allowed by regulators, and that over-irrigation of Big Sky golf courses with wastewater is leaching nitrogen into the Gallatin River.\nCottonwood brought the sewer district to court over the claims in 2020, but lost the federal case and its subsequent appeal.\nThe district and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality both pointed to the failed litigation — and said no state or federal investigation has found evidence of leakage in excess of standards.\nUnlike most American towns, including Bozeman, Big Sky is unique in that they don’t discharge treated effluent directly into waterways. In winter, the sewer district stores treated wastewater in three holding ponds upstream of the West Fork Gallatin River. The rest of the year, the effluent is used to irrigate golf courses in Big Sky and for Yellowstone Club snowmaking .\nBut elevated nitrogen pollution and excess algae growth in the Gallatin River have spurred calls to investigate how much treated wastewater is reaching the river anyway.\nIf the DEQ failed to adequately investigate the leaking holding ponds is the subject of another Cottonwood lawsuit , filed in 2022. A decision for that Gallatin County District Court case is expected sometime this summer.\nCottonwood’s executive director John Meyer said it was in deposition for the current lawsuit that sewer district manager Ron Edwards admitted to estimating data in 2020.\nThe data in question surrounded how much wastewater flowed into and left the district that year.\nIn the deposition , lawyers representing Edwards repeatedly told Meyer his questions about potential leakage were out of scope and didn’t require answers. But when asked if there were any known lapses in monitoring data, Edwards said there was a gap in 2020 because a flood in the irrigation pump room ruined five pump meters, and COVID delayed replacing them.\n“We estimated total water volumes in 2020 because we didn’t have all the meters in place,” Edwards said.\nEdwards told the Chronicle just because the data was an estimate doesn’t mean it was “completely made up” like Meyer is saying. Asked how the district ensured the numbers were accurate, Edwards said his civil engineers made the best possible estimates based on historic data and the working pump meters.\nMeyer said he’s hopeful the revelation will influence Cottonwood’s current litigation against DEQ.\n“It’s going to put more pressure on the DEQ to hold polluters accountable. The Big Sky Water and Sewer District provided the DEQ false records, and if the DEQ looks the other way, it says a whole lot about their commitment to protecting natural resources and their commitment to the law,” Meyer said. “It is not okay for a polluter to make up numbers and then lie to the investigators.”\nThe data is key for estimating potential leakage through a “water balance.” Cottonwood’s expert report, authored by University of Kansas PhD student Trevor Osorno , posits that if the volume of wastewater imported in a given year is less than the amount exported, the water system is leaking.\nUsing water balance calculations, Osorno’s report found that from 2015 to 2020, the sewer district could not account for an average of 25.7 million gallons of treated sewage each year.\nBut state and federal judges found the methodology to be inaccurate . Edwards said Cottonwood has repeatedly targeted him with claims that “have proved meritless time and time again.”\n“The amount of leak loss he was claiming was 21 million gallons. That’s bigger than my entire Pond 3 volume that’s 18 million and change. If we had that kind of leak loss, we would see that. My operators would see that something was wrong,” Edwards said in the federal trial .\nThe facility has two storage ponds that can hold a total of roughly 105 million gallons of wastewater, and an aeration basin that holds roughly 10 million gallons.\nDEQ spokesperson Moira Davin said in an email the agency has completed two separate investigations into Cottonwood’s allegations, once before the federal trial and once after, and “was unable to find credible evidence of leakage in excess of that allowed by state law.”\nThe claims were also considered by a jury of Montanans and investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, she added.\nA March 5, 2024 letter from DEQ closing the investigation said the agency reviewed Cottonwood’s expert report and additional data submitted by the sewer district.\nCottonwood’s expert report “is based on generalized assumptions without supporting data” and “uses outdated, inaccurate averages for precipitation and evaporation calculations,” wrote Susan Bawden, DEQ’s environmental enforcement specialist in the letter.\nThe district did repair a leak found in the “Chapel Drain” and inspected and repaired visible parts of the pond liners in late 2023, the letter said.\nCottonwood’s original complaint was prompted by a fluorescent tracer test in 2021, which dyed holding pond wastewater and then detected dye in the West Fork Gallatin River and tributary Chapel Springs days later.\nThe holding ponds are allowed to leak some, though. In court testimony , Edwards said the more accurate leakage estimation was 270,000 gallons in 2020. That’s still far below the 2.89 million gallons that DEQ allows to leak each year, a number calculated by Cottonwood’s expert.\nDavin said current DEQ standards allow the holding ponds to leak up to six inches per year.\nWhen wastewater systems are constructed, DEQ requires a leak test, Davin said. As systems age, DEQ can investigate leakage allegations and pursue enforcement actions if necessary.\nThe EPA investigation from July 2023 found that Osorno’s report is “not positive evidence” for a water leak — but agreed better records and a more refined water balance could help with investigations.\n“The facility has stated because they do not have a discharge permit, keeping meticulous records of flows and pond volumes is not required, and acknowledges there are gaps in their records,” the EPA letter said.\nThe district isn’t required to hold a Clean Water Act permit because of the federal case that determined they are not a “point source” polluter .\nA point source refers to pollution that comes from a discernible vessel like a pipe or a ditch and is directly discharged into a waterway. The district has an underdrain under one pond that collects groundwater to discharge to a manufactured wetland. The underdrain isn’t connected to the storage ponds, though. It sits underneath to prevent groundwater from “floating” the pond liners, the EPA said.\nSo far, Cottonwood has failed to overturn the court decision, which Meyer said is “unprecedented” and runs counter to a recent Clean Water Act case from Maui . He plans to push for a retrial again.\nThe sewer district has said previously if found necessary, it could apply for a permit to discharge treated wastewater directly into the mainstem Gallatin. The river is currently classified as water-quality impaired by algae, and DEQ is in the midst of a six-year study investigating the causes .\nMeyer said if DEQ wants to figure out where the algae is coming from, they should look at the leaking holding ponds.\nEdwards said ongoing $50 million improvements to the district will significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the wastewater recycled for irrigation.\n“The Gallatin River watershed has faced some challenges in recent years due to population growth. The district has stepped up to be part of the solution,” Edwards said.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Isabel Hicks is a Report for America corps member.

Come sono lì a contraddire Trump l’intero Emilia Pérez, il musical del regista francese Jacques Audiard (72 anni) i cui protagonisti sono quei messicani tanto avversati dal nuovo-vecchio presidente Usa, e le 2 nomination “pesanti“ (attori maschili pragonista e non protagonista, Sebastian Stan e Jeremy Strong), del film su The Donald The Apprentice, che lo stesso Trump aveva cercato di bloccare.\nKarla Sofía Gascón, 52 anni, protagonista di Emilia Pérez: per il film 13 nomination Per l’Italia una delusione: Vermiglio , il film di Maura Delpero girato in dialetto fra le montagne del Trentino, è fuori dalla cinquina per l’Oscar al miglior film internazionale.

È invece candidata all’Oscar come miglior attrice non protagonista Isabella Rossellini, suor Agnes in Conclave di Edward Berger; nella pellicola – 8 candidature – tratta dal bestseller di Robert Harris che vede protagonista Ralph Fiennes c’è anche molta Italia nel reparto costumi, con il lavoro di supervisione di Ilaria Marmugi a fianco di Lisy Christl, candidata per il costume design, e col lavoro di Riccardo Penko, designer delle 500 croci cardinalizie del film. Dieci le nomination a The Brutalist: il film di Brady Corbet Leone d’argento a Venezia, interpretato da un Adrien Brody mai così intenso dai tempi del Pianista è il vero competitor del film di Audiard. Approdato ieri in alcune sale italiane, The Brutalist è uno straordinario racconto/fiume di 215 minuti su un architetto ebreo scampato ai lager, approdato in America, e qui ideatore di un ambizioso, geniale, tragico progetto: la costruzione di un enorme centro multifunzionale. È una storia di immigrazione, di genio, di lotta contro i mecenati, di orgoglio e pregiudizi. Anche questo film parla all’America delle frontiere e dei muri di Trump.\nC’è anche poi molta, moltissima musica , nelle nomination. Oltre a Emilia Pérez , c’è l’impressionante Bob Dylan-Timothée Chalamet di A Complete Unknown di James Mangold, 8 nomination, da ieri nelle sale italiane. E c’è il musical Wicked – altro monito contro l’autoritarismo – che di nomination ne ha ottenute 10, a partire da quelle alle attrici Cynthia Erivo (tra le migliori protagoniste: a proposito, nulla di fatto per Jolie-Callas né per la coppia Swinton-Moore del Leone d’oro Almodóvar) e Ariana Grande (non protagonista). A completare il quadro dei film con più candidature (5) The Substance, il body horror con Demi Moore – 62 anni, candidata come miglior attrice, già vincitrice di un inatteso Golden Globe – e Anora . Palma d’oro a Cannes, Anora di Sean Baker ci porta a Brighton Beach, fra i gangster russi e ermeni di Brooklyn, fra divertimento sfrenato e sentimentalismo inatteso. Nomination per Mikey Madison come miglior attrice, e come non protagonista per l’ottimo Yura Borisov. È meno forte la presenza femminile, fra le registe – candidata solo solo la francese 48enne Coralie Fargeat per The Substance , e c’è sempre solo lei, come regista donna, fra i 10 titoli in corsa come miglior film: riassumendoli sono Emilia Peréz, The Brutalist, Wicked, Conclave, A Complete Unknown, Dune 2, The Substance, Anora poi – con 3 nomination – I’m Still Here (Sono ancora qui) di Walter Salles sui desaparecidos brasiliani e Nickel Boys (2) di RaMell Ross.\nImportanti anche le nomination al miglior film internazionale . Oltre ai bis di Emilia Pérez (perché parlato in spagnolo) e I’m Still Here , ci sono The Girl with the Needle, film in bianco e nero dello svedese Magnus von Horn denso di rimandi al grande cinema espressionista e Il seme del fico sacro di Mohammad Rasoulof. Il regista iraniano racconta una storia emblematica sulle spinte libertarie e le reazioni repressive nel suo Iran. Da cui, dopo il film, è dovuto scappare, condannato a cinque anni di reclusione e alla fustigazione. Una fuga compiuta a piedi, che ha fatto approdare il regista in Germania, dove adesso vive in esilio.\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "Coweta County commissioners shot down a shopping and entertainment development in Sharpsburg after the developers submitted an amended site plan one day before the public hearing. The original plan included more than 24 acres, 13 of which were requested to be zoned C-6 minor shopping commercial and 11 of which were proposed for C-9 commercial amusement zoning. There would have been four retail, restaurant and office buildings on the property zoned C-6 and a miniature golf course and indoor amusements including an arcade and bowling. The property is currently zoned rural conservation. Lisa Eschman, zoning coordinator, presented the original application and the zoning departments recommended conditions before saying that a new site plan had been submitted by email the day before. The original plan was submitted on July 21, 2023. “The revised site plan was not reviewed by staff, therefore it was not included in my presentation,” Eschman said. “The applicant is here, and they are more than welcome to present the revised site plan.” When asked later, she said that after just a cursory look at the new plan a proposed 50,000-square-foot building in the site plan would not have been allowed under the requested C-6 zoning. “The maximum for C-6 is 35,000 square feet for one single enterprise,” she said. “They would have to go to the next zoning district, which is C-7.” Commissioner Paul Poole said the public has not been made aware of these changes. Commissioner Al Smith asked if the commissioners should even continue considering the plan. “I’m conflicted,” Smith said. Commission Chair John Reidelbach agreed. “Making a decision tonight, we don’t know what the outcome will be because they’re going to change the plans,” Reidelbach said. Attorney Nathan Lee said legally the commissioners could consider the new plan, but he questioned whether that would be fair to the public. “I think if you have to base your decision, it should be based on the application that was presented in accordance with your ordinances,” Lee said. County Administrator Michael Fouts said that typically any changes are due seven days prior to the public hearing in order to notify the public of the change and remove it from the agenda. But there had been no request to remove it from the agenda. The application was submitted on behalf of Justin Gibson, who owned the Heirloom Market Company and Bakeshop that was destroyed in a fire in September 2023. Heirloom still operates a bakeshop in downtown Newnan and LaGrange, as well as a store and donut shop in Peachtree City. Neal Spradlin, who represented Heirloom Market Company, said the changes, including consolidating four of the buildings into one two-story building, were made to ease parking and traffic flow, as well as, add more green space. “It doesn’t change the scope of the project at all,” Spradlin said. Ryan Huber, a partner in the project, said they were unaware that submitting the new plan would cause confusion. “Those submissions for the other site plan, we can withdraw,” Huber said. Several residents spoke in favor of the project including Jake Mullins, who said he lived 2,000 feet from the proposed project. “It’s not a matter of if this parcel is going to go commercial, it’s who and what,” Mullins said. Mullins liked that the project was being proposed by local entrepreneurs, particularly by Justin Gibson, owner of Heirloom Market Company and Bake Shop. “(Heirloom) was an amazing place, amazing people, just the community, the support,” Mullins said. “It’s unlike any other bakery shop I’ve ever seen and one of the saddest things I’ve seen in recent history is Justin Gibson, with his head buried in his hands the day after it burned down.” Phil Hensel said the old horse farm where the project is proposed has been up for sale for a long time. “As much as I would like to see the county stay rural, there was clearly not a demand from the public for another horse farm.” There were also several people opposed to the project. Clark Verbockel said the traffic from any additional commercial enterprises would overwhelm the roads there. “I don’t think Lower Fayetteville Road is ready for anything like this yet or any commercialization,” Verbockel said. Linda Menk said that the area’s rural character should be preserved. “(The horse farms are) part of the charm of Coweta County,” Menk said. “That’s one of the reasons that has attracted so many people to Coweta County.” Andy Powell, who with his wife pastures horses on a 30 acre farm on Lower Fayetteville Road, said he believes Heirloom intends the best for the neighbors, but C-9 zoning is intense zoning for that area. Robert Reeder has lived nearby for 30 years, he said. He has a horse farm and raised his family on the rural property and is opposed to the project. It was his understanding that no more commercial entrances would be added to that part of Lower Fayetteville Road, he said. “There was an agreement made,” Reeder said, referring to the Fischer Marketplace project across Lower Fayetteville Road. “It was to protect everybody up that way and on Fischer as well and it’s worked… This would completely undo that.” The commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning request and a second request for a buffer variance for the project. In other business, the council members: Approved rezoning a 3.8-acre vacant lot off of Highway 16 East between East Willow Drive and RV Drive from light manufacturing auto industrial to light manufacturing for a self storage facility. The commissioners also approved a variance allowing a 25 foot buffer along the entire western border of the property. Denied a request for a front yard setback for two lots on Bears Bend Subdivision in Moreland. Approved a 12-month extension for Habiba Investments for a property at 869 Poplar Road. The original agreement was for the company to apply for a building permit within one year. It has already applied for a land disturbance permit. Accepted roadways and the execution of a deed of open space associated with property in Belle Hall Subdivision. Reappointed Reidelbach as a committee member of the Three Rivers Regional Council. Appointed Poole, Director of Transportation Planning Sid Bedenbaugh, Grants Manager Charlyn Shepherd, Communications Manager Cathy Wickey, Tommy Kennedy and Harvey Smith to the Coweta County Transit Technical Coordinating Committee. Their new terms will end on Dec. 31, 2025. Approved spending $20,000 in special purpose local option sales tax dollars for an estimation of engineering services required by the Georgia Department of Transportation for a widening project on Poplar Road and improvements to the intersection of Poplar Road and Highway 16. Approved a number of bids for tree pruning totaling about $99,139. Rejected all bids associated with the construction of the Senoia Fire Station and for renovation of the 911 center because they exceeded the amount budgeted for the projects. The county will rebid the fire station project. Approved an agreement with the Coweta County School System to allow the system to lease space on the telecommunications tower for $6,000 a year. Approved a quit claim deed for the 1.93 acre property at 22 Broad St. to the Coweta County Development Authority for marketing. Approved the Nov. 7 election results for the 2025 SPLOST. The SPLOST was approved by the public. Approved elected officials salaries and supplements. Approved a line of duty death benefit for all employees effective Jan. 1, 2024. The benefit allows a spouse and children of the deceased employee to remain on the group health insurance plan for up to six months in the case of the spouse or up to the age of 26 in the case of the children. Approved a Victims of Crime Act Grant Award to the District Attorney’s Office. The grant is for $81,368 and requires a match of $20,342. Approved right of entry associated with storm drain repairs at 384 Marsha Way, 15, 25 and 30 Navaho Way and 120 Indian Bluff Drive all in Sharpsburg. Approved a request to use the Justice Center for the Regional Mock Trial Competition on Saturday, Feb. 10. Held an executive session to discuss personnel after which they approved an unnamed personnel action. Heard from a number of people about the benefits of hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballots and others who asked that the commissioners implement spay and neuter ordinances in the county.",

A lot of the flavor comes from the sauteed veggies so there’s no need to simmer it for hours either. SO much flavor. Lentils themselves don’t have a big flavor profile but this soup definitely does. The veggies are sauteed first, which adds depth to the flavor, and there’s a generous amount of Aleppo pepper flakes added for a smokey flavor. So, so good! Tastes better the next day. I love making this creamy red lentil soup at the beginning of the week and enjoying the leftovers for lunch throughout the week. Sometimes I’ll even make a batch with plans to enjoy it later. It’s definitely a soup where the flavors get better with time! Great vegetarian (or vegan) option. If you’re trying out Meatless Monday or having some vegetarian friends over, this soup is a great option. Just use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to keep it vegetarian and swap the heavy cream for coconut cream to make it vegan. So easy! What You’ll Need In addition to lentils, you’ll need a few veggies, broth, and a handful of other ingredients to make this soup. You can find the exact measurements of each ingredient in the recipe card below.\nOlive oil – For sauteing the veggies. Veggies – Carrots, onion, and red bell pepper add flavor, color, and substance to this creamy lentil soup. Salt Garlic – For additional flavor. Tomato paste – Adds rich umami flavor to the broth. Aleppo pepper flakes – Aleppo pepper is a traditional Turkish spice and lends a wonderful smokey citrus flavor to the soup. It is less spicy than regular red pepper flakes and gives the soup its bright color. I like this brand. Red lentils – Red lentils cook quickly and have a creamy texture, which makes them perfect for soup. Broth – Use vegetable broth to keep this soup vegetarian (or vegan) or chicken broth if that’s what you have on hand. Heavy cream – If you are opting for a vegan red lentil soup, coconut cream can also be used. Lemon juice – Fresh lemon juice is key. It brightens up the soup by adding a bit of acidity. How To Make Red Lentil Soup This lentil soup is surprisingly quick and easy to make! Scroll down to the recipe card below for the printable version of the instructions.\nCook the veggies. Cook the veggies in oil over medium-high heat. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook until softened and browned, about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the aromatics. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, and Aleppo pepper flakes. Cook for a minute. Simmer. Stir in the red lentils, broth, and water. Bring to a boil then cover and reduce to low. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The lentils should be very soft and the carrots easily smashed against the pot. Blend. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup to your desired consistency. Add the cream. Stir in the cream and lemon juice. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Enjoy. Ladle into bowls, add your desired garnishes, and enjoy! Tips & Variations Here are a few things I’ve learned while making this red lentil soup recipe.\nDon’t try to rush sautéing the vegetables. Most of the flavor in the soup comes from the caramelization of the sugars in the vegetables, so if you don’t let them cook long enough the soup won’t have a deep, rich flavor. Aleppo pepper substitutes. If Aleppo pepper is unavailable, substitute with a pinch of regular red pepper flakes (do not use an entire teaspoon, the soup will be too spicy). Alternatively, regular paprika can be used to flavor the soup without adding spice. What if I don’t have an immersion blender? You can also puree the soup in a blender. Just transfer half of the soup mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Return the puree to the soup pot and stir well to combine. Add more salt if needed. Depending on the salt content of your broth, you may need to add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt at the end of cooking in step number five. Definitely taste test it first as some brands of chicken broth can be quite salty on their own! Serving Suggestions I like to add some garnishes to the bowls before serving this soup. Additional cream, lemon slices, cilantro, Aleppo pepper flakes, and freshly cracked black pepper are all good options.\nFor a heartier meal, I like to serve this soup with a scoop of basmati rice in the bowl. It soaks up the broth so nicely and makes it a bit more filling. Another option is to serve with a side of crusty bread. You just want something to make sure you get every last drop of the tasty broth in the bowl!\nHow To Store & Reheat Leftovers Fridge. Store leftover red lentil soup in an airtight container in the fridge. It tastes even better the next day! Leftovers will last for up to 4 days. Freezer. To freeze the soup, allow it to cool completely then transfer to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge. Reheat gently on the stovetop, stirring frequently. Reheat. Reheat leftovers on the stovetop, stirring frequently. This soup will thicken as it cools. When reheating leftovers, you may wish to add a little extra water or cream to loosen it up.

[Published](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(24)00714-4/abstract) in the American Journal of Infection Control, the researchers say the guidelines could promote early detection of C.auris in high-risk patients and prevent hospital outbreaks. Mount Sinai initially screened people with more obvious risk factors, including patients with a tracheostomy or those on a ventilator, before expanding the guidelines.

    "title": "Not Interested in Playing for Pakistan: Shoaib Malik - Global Village Space",
    "text": "Veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik has officially announced that he has no intention of returning to international cricket for Pakistan. In a candid interview, Malik, who has already retired from Test and One-Day Internationals, confirmed his decision to step away from the national team entirely. “No, I am happy and satisfied after playing for so many years. I have no interest in playing for Pakistan again,” Malik declared. The 42-year-old cricketing icon emphasized his contentment with his past achievements and his enjoyment of league cricket.\nHaving made his international debut in 1999, Malik has had a storied career, featuring in 35 Tests, 287 ODIs, and 124 T20Is. His contributions include over 11,000 runs across formats and 218 wickets. Despite his retirement from the Test and ODI formats, Malik’s retirement from T20 cricket remains pending, though he has expressed a clear intent to eventually retire from all forms of international play. “I have no interest, but as I said in my previous interviews, I will announce my retirement from all forms of cricket once and for all,” he noted.\nCriticizing Leadership and Future Directions Throughout his career, Malik has occasionally criticized Pakistan’s cricket leadership, particularly focusing on Babar Azam’s captaincy. Malik believes that Babar should relinquish his captaincy role to concentrate on his batting. “As for his captaincy, my firm stance is that he [Babar Azam] should play only as a player. That’s my opinion. When he plays as a player, he can do wonders for the team. He should stay away from leadership,” Malik advised. His comments reflect his long-standing perspective on effective cricket leadership and player performance.\nRead More: UN Calls for Action Against Pakistan’s Violence on Ahmadi Community\nMalik’s perspective on leadership aligns with his belief in maximizing player potential by removing distractions such as captaincy roles. His suggestions come amid ongoing discussions about Pakistan’s cricketing strategy and leadership effectiveness. By advocating for Babar Azam to focus solely on batting, Malik emphasizes the importance of player specialization in achieving team success.\nMalik’s Legacy Malik’s achievements in T20 cricket are particularly notable. With 13,360 runs scored in domestic T20 matches, he stands as the second-highest run-scorer in this format, trailing only West Indies legend Chris Gayle. Malik has accumulated 83 fifties in 542 T20 matches, showcasing his significant impact in the shorter format. In international T20Is, Malik has amassed 2,435 runs and taken 28 wickets, demonstrating his all-round capabilities.\nDespite his extensive T20 career, Malik’s focus has shifted to league cricket, where he continues to enjoy playing opportunities. His retirement from international cricket does not diminish his achievements but rather signifies a transition to new pursuits and roles within the sport. Malik’s decision to focus on league cricket reflects his ongoing passion for the game and his desire to contribute to cricket in different ways.\nAs Shoaib Malik moves forward, his contributions to cricket will be remembered not only for his prolific performances but also for his insights into leadership and player development. His departure from international cricket marks the end of an era but also opens new avenues for his involvement in the sport. Malik’s legacy, built on years of dedication and excellence, will continue to influence the cricketing world as he embraces new challenges and opportunities.\nWith his retirement, Malik leaves behind a distinguished career and a wealth of experience that will undoubtedly benefit the cricketing community. His emphasis on player-focused leadership and his continued involvement in league cricket highlight his enduring commitment to the sport.",
