    "title": "Why Tellurian Stock Popped as Much as 25% This Week",
    "text": "Shares of Tellurian ( TELL -7.31% ) climbed as much as 25% this week, then settled to trade up around 5% as of Thursday's close, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . This occurred as the beleaguered natural gas company outlined significant efforts to stave off its potential bankruptcy.\nTellurian is working to stave off bankruptcy concerns The company has struggled with multiple headwinds in the funding and construction of its massive $25 billion Driftwood Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plant project. Shares plunged in October after the company formally asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to delay the plant's opening by another two years, to 2029.\nTellurian then raised eyebrows in early November by issuing a \"going concern\" warning in its third-quarter report. It pointed out that the $59.3 million in cash reserves on its balance sheet at the end of September wouldn't be sufficient to cover its obligations and fund working capital needs for next year.\nIn a letter to shareholders published Thursday morning, however, Tellurian Chairman Martin Houston noted the company has already made substantial progress since he took the helm three weeks ago. Its moves to improve liquidity and bolster its balance sheet so far include a nearly 50% reduction in general and administrative expenses, a new $37.9 million debt-for-equity swap with its principal lender, and an increased stake (to 7.3% from 5.2%) from institutional investor Chatterjee Fund Management.\nWhat's next for Tellurian investors? Mr. Houston pledged \"to be as open and transparent as we can, with the expectation that this will allow you greater trust in assessing our progress.\"\nThat's all well and good, of course, and it's great to see the company moving aggressively to improve liquidity. Still, Tellurian's \"going concern\" warning still highlights that this is a very high-risk stock with a significant risk of bankruptcy .\nThere might be significant upside for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet Tellurian can climb out of this hole. But with plenty of other healthier natural gas stocks in this market, I'm personally content watching Tellurian's progress from the sidelines.",

    "text": "“In Sevastopol, an agent of the Ukrainian military intelligence, a Russian citizen born in 1965, who was trained in the use of explosives and individual firearms, as well as tracking and surveillance work, was detained. He was trained in the use of covert communication methods. It turned out that he had prepared an explosive device that was used in July 2024 to blow up a gas pipeline in the Republic of Crimea. During his detention, a similar explosive device was found in his personal car,” the Russian security service said in a statement.\nIn the port of Kerch in eastern Crimea, a Moldovan citizen, born in 1992, with a criminal record, was detained and in April 2024, he made contact with Ukrainian intelligence On the Internet, on her behalf, he collected and transmitted information about the locations of the Russian military and transport and energy infrastructure facilities in Crimea, as well as photographed the results of enemy missile strikes. A resident of Sevastopol, born in 1973, with Russian citizenship, was also detained. He was recruited by the Ukrainian military intelligence to collect information about the locations of military facilities on the Russian peninsula, as well as the addresses of senior Russian officers in the region and the cars they used.\nAccording to the Russian security statement, the three detainees confessed to all the charges against them.\nThe statement indicated that the investigation is still ongoing, with the aim of identifying all those who cooperated with these detainees.\nSource: TASS\n#Russian #security #forces #arrest #Ukrainian #intelligence #agents #Crimea\n2024-08-22 20:06:16",
