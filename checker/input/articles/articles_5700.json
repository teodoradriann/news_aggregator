    "title": "EXCLUSIVE ART: Scott Hoffman and Alberto Ponticelli's \"WARM FUSION\" Is a Dystopian Body-Horror Nightmare - Rue Morgue",
    "text": "By WILLIAM J. WRIGHT Fifty years into the future, New York City is a dystopian hellscape, ravaged by crime, storms, residual radiation from a devastating terrorist attack and genetic mutations in WARM FUSION, the upcoming sci-fi horror limited comic series from writer Scott Hoffman (Nostalgia, Wag, member of pop icons Scissor Sisters) and artist Alberto Ponticelli (Frankenstein: Agent of S.H.A.D.E., Orc Island). Debuting this November from creator-owned publisher DSTLRY, WARM FUSION promises to plunge readers into a nightmarish vision in which “biotech corporations unleash atrocities to rival the serial killers stalking the night.” From DSTLRY’s synopsis: After a series of murders rip through the city’s brothels, an escort named Vin Young, who cosplays as the Brothers Grimm’s Snow White – and is one of the generation of deformed victims – pursues the killer (or killers), reluctantly joining forces with Jarrod Hannover, the lone cop assigned to the case. The two eventually arrive at a biotech megacorp developing a cellular metal called Warm Fusion, a pioneering technology meant to replace prosthetics limbs, and soon confront the sociopathic scientist Nicholas Fleischer, his monstrous alter-ego, Mr. Barnaby; and the hideous monster that he’s been secretly developing. “Warm Fusion is a deep dive into the grotesque possibilities of biotechnology and its impact on humanity,” says writer Scott Hoffman. “Alberto Ponticelli’s art is transportive, blurring the lines between flesh, machine, and everyone caught in the gutters between. This is an evolution of the body horror classics I watched growing up, and perfect for a time when humanity is obsessed with (and achieving) provocative new levels of post-humanism.” “Working on Warm Fusion has been an exhilarating experience,” adds artist Alberto Ponticelli. “The world Scott and I have incubated straddles horror and hope, and imagining the extremes humanity will warp itself into in the coming decades has been perverse and delightful.” DSTLRY was kind enough to share some concept art for WARM FUSION exclusively with RUE MORGUE. See the gallery below: For more information on Warm Fusion and to keep up with DSTLRY’s upcoming releases, visit [www.dstlry.co](http://www.dstlry.co) and follow DSTLRY on social media at @DSTLRY_Media.",

    "text": "Utilizzare lo stesso lavoratore interinale per anni, sulle stesse mansioni, è irregolare se l’azienda non dimostra valide ragioni.\nIl lavoro somministrato, o interinale, è spesso presentato come uno strumento di flessibilità indispensabile per le aziende, utile per far fronte a picchi di produzione, sostituire personale assente o gestire progetti a termine. Nasce con una vocazione alla temporaneità. Ma cosa accade quando questa “temporaneità” si protrae nel tempo, e lo stesso lavoratore interinale diventa una presenza costante, magari per anni, svolgendo le stesse mansioni di un dipendente diretto? Quando è irregolare il lavoro interinale per anni?\nLa giurisprudenza (da ultimo Corte d’Appello di Lecce sent. n. 196 del 10 marzo 2025) ha recentemente affrontato proprio questa problematica, mettendo in guardia le imprese utilizzatrici. L’impiego prolungato e ininterrotto di lavoratori somministrati, senza adeguate e comprovate giustificazioni legate a reali esigenze di flessibilità, può trasformare un rapporto nato come temporaneo in qualcosa di molto diverso, con conseguenze rilevanti per l’azienda. Andiamo ad analizzare nel dettaglio i principi affermati dai giudici salentini, che si pongono in linea con l’interpretazione della normativa europea in materia.\nUn’azienda può utilizzare lo stesso lavoratore somministrato per anni senza interruzioni? Il lavoro interinale, o somministrazione di lavoro, è una forma di rapporto di lavoro in cui un’agenzia di somministrazione mette a disposizione di un’impresa utilizzatrice uno o più lavoratori per un periodo determinato o indeterminato. Tuttavia, l’uso prolungato di lavoratori interinali presso la stessa impresa può diventare irregolare se non rispetta i limiti e le condizioni previsti dalla normativa vigente.\nLa disciplina della somministrazione di lavoro è contenuta nel Decreto Legislativo n. 81/2015. In particolare, l’articolo 31 stabilisce che la somministrazione di lavoro a tempo determinato è utilizzata nei limiti quantitativi individuati dai contratti collettivi applicati dall’utilizzatore. Inoltre, l’articolo 34, comma 2, prevede che il rapporto di lavoro tra somministratore e lavoratore è soggetto alla disciplina del contratto a tempo determinato per quanto compatibile, con esclusione delle disposizioni relative alla durata massima, alle proroghe e ai rinnovi.\nTemporaneità e limiti del lavoro interinale La Corte di Giustizia dell’Unione Europea ha chiarito che il lavoro tramite agenzia interinale deve avere carattere temporaneo . In particolare, nella sentenza del 14 ottobre 2020 (causa C-681/18) e nella successiva sentenza del 17 marzo 2022 (causa C-232/20), la Corte ha affermato che le missioni successive dello stesso lavoratore presso la stessa impresa utilizzatrice non devono condurre a una durata dell’attività più lunga di quella che può essere ragionevolmente qualificata come temporanea (Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 23494 del 27-07-2022; Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 22861 del 21-07-2022).\nLa necessaria temporaneità delle missioni deve essere assicurata, anche in assenza di una previsione normativa esplicita nei singoli ordinamenti nazionali. Pertanto, è compito dei giudici nazionali stabilire caso per caso se la durata delle missioni possa essere considerata temporanea, tenendo conto di tutte le circostanze pertinenti, comprese le specificità del settore.\nQuando il lavoro interinale diventa irregolare La Corte d’Appello di Lecce, con la sentenza 196/2025, ha stabilito che l’impiego di un lavoratore somministrato per un arco di tempo molto lungo (nel caso specifico si fa riferimento implicitamente a un periodo di circa tre anni, ma il principio è applicabile a durate prolungate in generale) presso la medesima azienda utilizzatrice, per svolgere sempre le stesse mansioni e risultando stabilmente inserito nel ciclo produttivo, configura una somministrazione irregolare ai sensi dell’articolo 38 del Decreto Legislativo 81/2015.\nQuesto avviene, però, a una condizione fondamentale: che l’azienda utilizzatrice non sia in grado di dimostrare l’esistenza di ragioni concrete, oggettive e specifiche che giustifichino la necessità di protrarre le missioni del lavoratore per un periodo così esteso. In altre parole, non basta semplicemente rinnovare i contratti di missione tramite l’agenzia interinale; l’azienda deve poter provare che quel prolungato ricorso al lavoro esterno rispondeva a effettive esigenze di flessibilità e non a un fabbisogno di personale stabile e ordinario.\nNel caso esaminato dalla Corte di Lecce, un ulteriore elemento che ha contribuito a qualificare come irregolare la situazione è stato il ricorso sistematico e massiccio al lavoro supplementare e straordinario richiesto al lavoratore somministrato, indice di un suo stabile inserimento nell’organizzazione aziendale per far fronte a esigenze non meramente temporanee.\nCosa dice la legge sui limiti massimi di durata per il lavoro somministrato? La normativa europea di riferimento, ovvero la Direttiva 2008/104/CE relativa al lavoro tramite agenzia interinale, non stabilisce direttamente dei limiti massimi di durata precisi e universali per le missioni dei lavoratori somministrati presso un’azienda utilizzatrice. Tuttavia, la direttiva persegue un obiettivo chiaro: contemperare le legittime esigenze di flessibilità delle imprese con la necessità di garantire un livello minimo di tutela e sicurezza ai lavoratori somministrati.\nFondamentale, in questo quadro, è il concetto di “ temporaneità ” della missione. Anche se non quantificata in mesi o anni a livello europeo, la natura intrinsecamente temporanea del lavoro tramite agenzia interinale è un caposaldo della direttiva.\nInoltre, l’articolo 5, paragrafo 5, della stessa direttiva impone agli Stati membri (e quindi all’Italia) di adottare misure efficaci per prevenire l’abuso del ricorso alla somministrazione, in particolare per evitare che una successione di contratti o missioni presso lo stesso utilizzatore venga utilizzata per eludere le norme in materia di lavoro (ad esempio, quelle sui contratti a termine o sulla stabilità dell’impiego). È proprio interpretando questo principio di temporaneità e la clausola anti-abuso che le corti nazionali ed europee pongono dei limiti all’utilizzo indiscriminato e prolungato della somministrazione.\nLa Corte di Giustizia dell’Unione Europea (CGUE) è intervenuta più volte per interpretare la Direttiva 2008/104/CE. La CGUE nella sentenza del 17 marzo 2022, resa nella causa C-232/20, ha chiarito che la direttiva europea osta a una normativa nazionale (o a una prassi aziendale) che permetta una successione di missioni del medesimo lavoratore interinale presso la stessa azienda utilizzatrice, qualora la durata complessiva di tali missioni non possa ragionevolmente essere qualificata come “temporanea” alla luce delle circostanze concrete del caso. Esiste però un’eccezione cruciale: questa successione prolungata di missioni può essere legittima se l’azienda utilizzatrice è in grado di fornire specifiche ragioni obiettive che giustifichino il ricorso continuativo a quel lavoratore tramite agenzia interinale.\nQuali sono le “ragioni” valide per un impiego prolungato? Il testo della sentenza della Corte d’Appello di Lecce non elenca specificamente quali siano le ragioni giustificatrici valide, ma si concentra sul fatto che, nel caso esaminato, l’azienda utilizzatrice non le aveva tempestivamente allegate e provate. Tuttavia, basandosi sulla logica della normativa e della giurisprudenza, possiamo ipotizzare alcune categorie di ragioni che potrebbero essere considerate “obiettive”:\nesigenze tecniche, produttive, organizzative o sostitutive straordinarie : ad esempio, la necessità di far fronte a picchi di lavoro imprevisti e significativi, l’avvio di un nuovo progetto a termine con una durata definita ma prolungata, la sostituzione di più lavoratori assenti in sequenza per lunghi periodi (es. maternità, malattie lunghe), la necessità di competenze altamente specialistiche non presenti in azienda e reperibili solo temporaneamente sul mercato per un determinato compito. natura stagionale dell’attività : se l’attività aziendale è intrinsecamente stagionale, il ricorso ripetuto allo stesso lavoratore somministrato durante i periodi di alta stagione potrebbe essere giustificato. Ciò che invece non costituisce una ragione obiettiva è il semplice fabbisogno di coprire posizioni lavorative stabili e ordinarie all’interno dell’organizzazione aziendale. Se il lavoratore somministrato viene impiegato per anni per svolgere compiti continuativi e integrati nel normale ciclo produttivo, senza che vi sia una specifica esigenza temporanea, si presume che l’azienda stia utilizzando la somministrazione in modo elusivo per evitare l’assunzione a tempo indeterminato. L’onere di dimostrare l’esistenza di queste ragioni obiettive ricade sull’azienda utilizzatrice.\nIl lavoro interinale diventa irregolare quando:\nsupera i limiti temporali ragionevoli : se le missioni successive dello stesso lavoratore presso la stessa impresa utilizzatrice si protraggono per un periodo che non può essere considerato temporaneo, si configura un abuso della somministrazione di lavoro (Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 23494 del 27-07-2022; Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 22861 del 21-07-2022); viola le condizioni di utilizzo previste dalla legge . In caso di somministrazione irregolare, il lavoratore può chiedere la costituzione di un rapporto di lavoro alle dipendenze dell’utilizzatore, con effetto dall’inizio della somministrazione; elude le finalità della Direttiva 2008/104/CE : la direttiva europea sul lavoro tramite agenzia interinale mira a garantire che il lavoro interinale non diventi una situazione permanente per il lavoratore. Un uso abusivo della somministrazione, volto a eludere la natura temporanea del rapporto, è contrario agli obiettivi della direttiva (Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 23494 del 27-07-2022; Cass. Civ., Sez. L, N. 22861 del 21-07-2022). Conseguenze legali dell’uso irregolare del lavoro interinale In caso di somministrazione irregolare, il lavoratore ha diritto alla costituzione di un rapporto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato con l’impresa utilizzatrice, con effetto retroattivo dall’inizio della somministrazione. Inoltre, l’utilizzatore può essere tenuto al risarcimento del danno subito dal lavoratore .\nIn pratica, il lavoratore cessa di essere formalmente un dipendente dell’agenzia interinale (per quanto riguarda quella specifica missione/situazione) e diventa a tutti gli effetti un dipendente a tempo indeterminato dell’azienda presso cui ha prestato la sua attività in modo prolungato e non giustificato. L’azienda utilizzatrice si trova quindi con un nuovo dipendente stabile, con tutti i diritti e le tutele che ne derivano. Questa è una conseguenza diretta volta a ripristinare la situazione di legalità e a sanzionare l’uso improprio della flessibilità offerta dal contratto di somministrazione.",

    "title": "Dozens of people get sick after L.A. Times 101 Best Restaurants event; health officials investigating",
    "text": "By Salvador Hernandez ,\n33 minutes ago Health officials are investigating a possible norovirus outbreak after dozens of people became sick after eating raw oysters at the L.A. Times 101 Best Restaurants event.\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed that more than 80 people who attended the annual event — which features some of the area's most celebrated and popular restaurants — reported getting sick with symptoms that included diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting.\nThe illnesses appear to be linked to raw oysters provided at the Dec. 3 event that have since been recalled, according to a public health spokesperson.\nThe dozens of reported illnesses from the event came just days before the California Department of Public Health on Dec. 13 issued a recall for the oysters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has since issued a warning to restaurants and retailers not to sell the oysters on account of potential norovirus contamination. The warning affected restaurants and retailers in multiple states.\nThe oysters were supplied by Fanny Bay Oysters, according to Hillary Manning, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times. The oysters were sourced by Santa Monica Seafood, which was a sponsor of the event, and provided to one of the restaurants featured in the 101 Best Restaurants list, Manning said.\nNews of the possible outbreak was first reported by L.A. Taco .\nLike previous events hosted by the Los Angeles Times, Manning said that all safety protocols were followed for the event.\n\"We have produced culinary events for many years and take food safety very seriously,\" she wrote in an email. \"As is the case with each of our events, we had protocols in place and, based on an inspection from the L.A. County Department of Public Health, we were in compliance with all relevant safety standards. We also know the care that each chef and restaurant takes in preparing and serving food to our community.\"\nWithout specific testing, there is no way for a vendor or restaurant to detect norovirus because it does not affect the taste, smell, or appearance of oysters.\nThe Los Angeles Times first became aware that some people from the event became sick on Dec. 11. Officials at the company, who were unaware of the cause, referred people to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. On Dec. 12, the public health department contacted The Times about a group of people who had reported getting sick.\nThere were people who attended the event who reported not seeing any kind of notice or alert from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\nJamie Clegg, who bought two tickets to the event, said he never saw a notice in his email.\n\"I didn't get anything, unless it inadvertently went to spam,\" he said.\nHe went to the event with a friend who is employed by the L.A. Times, he said, and that person did get an email from county health officials notifying them about the illness cluster and asking them to take an anonymous questionnaire.\nThe oysters served on Dec. 3 were part of a batch of recalled Fanny Bay Select and Fanny Bay XS oysters from Pacific Northwest Shellfish Co., which were packed on Nov. 25, the county public health spokesperson said.\nThe outbreak is still under investigation.\nSomeone infected by the virus could experience symptoms for 12 to 48 hours, according to the FDA.\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times .",

    "text": "Ariel Holan: \"Merecimos una mejor suerte\" El director técnico de Barcelona Sporting Club, Ariel Holan, considera que merecieron mejor suerte en el playoff de la Copa Sudamericana ante el Bragantino de Brasil. El cuadro torero quedó eliminado y Holan encontró las razones. \"Los partidos, muchas veces, tienen detalles que desequilibran. Más allá del trámite del partido, nosotros tuvimos la posesión, mayor cantidad de tiros libres y corners, pero por ahí nos costó entrar con más claridad\", inició en la conferencia de prensa. Para el argentino, el cuadro torero jugó bien. \"Hicimos un muy buen primer tiempo. Fuimos superiores. En el segundo, el gol de entrada nos dejó unos minutos golpeados para reaccionar. Y el de salida no nos dejó tiempo para reaccionar\", agregó. Sobre el gol que desequilibró todo, dijo, \"es una pelota que, antes de la buena finalización del rival, hay unos rebotes, una pelota que no podemos salir limpia de atrás y ahí quedamos mal parados. El balance de los 180 minutos, creo que merecíamos más. Forzaron nuestro error a partir de la intensidad\". El siguiente reto para Barcelona será la Copa Ecuador, ante Independiente Juniors. Para ese juego, Holan anticipó que se apoyará en los juveniles.
