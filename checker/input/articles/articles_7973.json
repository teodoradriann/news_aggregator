    "text": "Severe weather forecast across parts of Hawaii, US, through at least May 13. Flooding and associated disruptions possible. Thunderstorms are forecast across parts of Hawaii through at least May 13. Heavy snow of up to 15 cm (6 inches) and strong winds gusting over 113 kph (70 mph) are forecast across higher elevations. As of late May 9, the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings for the island of Maui in Maui County through 19:30 May 9, as well as winter storm and high wind warnings across the Big Island Summits through early May 11. Flood watches are in place for all the main Hawaiian islands through late May 10. High surf advisories are in effect for the south-facing shores of all Hawaiian Islands through late May 10. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed or a lack of stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding, strong winds, or landslides impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in Hawaii. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "text": "By Thomas Neumann ,\n1 hour ago\nCaitlin Clark is a big fan of Luke Combs, and the feeling is mutual.\nThe former Iowa Hawkeyes standout was selected No. 1 overall in the 2024 WNBA draft on Monday night, to the surprise of nobody in the women’s basketball world. She’s headed to the Indiana Fever, and 36 of the team’s 40 games will be televised nationally this season as a direct result of her popularity.\nIn the moments following Clark’s draft selection, she was treated to a congratulatory video from the country music star.\n“I just wanted to say congratulations on being the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft. That’s incredible,” Combs said. “I know I can speak for everybody all across the United States and the world, probably, that we’ve enjoyed watching you these last couple years, and we can’t wait to continue to do so. So congratulations. You earned it. Can’t wait to see you out there.”\nClark was clearly elated by the message.\n“Luke Combs! That’s my favorite artist of all time,” Clark said. “That’s pretty cool. He’s a big women’s basketball fan, so I appreciate him. That’s amazing. I was not expecting that!”\nClark makes her WNBA preseason debut when the Fever visit the Dallas Wings on May 3. Her regular-season pro debut will be a road game against the Connecticut Sun on May 14 at 7:30 p.m. ET. That game will be broadcast on ESPN2.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "New litter abatement department aims to clean up Livingston Parish LIVINGSTON PARISh, La. (WAFB) - It’s not a sight anyone wants to see — roads and waterways littered with trash — but it’s something Livingston Parish residents are having to look at and live with. “It is easy to see: There is a lot of litter. It causes safety issues, diseases and flooding,” said Livingston Parish President Randy Delatte. Delatte decided to do something about it. The newly-elected parish president is forming a litter abatement department under his administration. “People are concerned. There are things we have to attack, and attack it now,” Delatte explained. To run the new department, he has appointed Lynda Gardiner, the director of “Keep Livingston Beautiful” — an organization already dedicated to keeping the area clean. “We did a litter study last year. We were in the top two,” Gardiner said. This puts Livingston Parish as one of the top two parishes in the state facing a severe litter problem, and that’s not a place Gardiner wants to be. She says litter is stopping the parish from growing. “It reflects the parish. It has stopped businesses from coming in,” Gardiner explained. One of the key early initiatives for the litter abatement department will be to work with the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office and 21st Judicial District Court. “The 21st Judicial requires litter pickup for people that have community service work. We don’t have a mechanism to do that yet. The sheriff has trustees doing that,” Delatte added. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo. Copyright 2024 WAFB. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Risk management : une carrière qui paie\nLe secteur de la gestion des risques dans la finance attire de plus en plus de professionnels grâce à son rôle stratégique et ses rémunérations solides. De l’analyste au managing director, les parcours sont variés et les spécialisations multiples, allant du risque de marché au risque de liquidité. Voici un résumé percutant des tendances 2024 en matière de carrière et de rémunération dans ce domaine, pour mieux comprendre comment y faire sa place.\nUne mission cruciale au sein de la banque\nLes métiers du risk management visent à anticiper, mesurer et atténuer les risques inhérents aux activités financières. Ces risques sont classés en quatre catégories principales : marché, crédit, opérationnel et liquidité. Les gestionnaires de risques ont pour mission d'éviter à leur entreprise des chocs susceptibles de la déstabiliser, tout en respectant un cadre réglementaire strict renforcé après des crises comme celle de Credit Suisse.\nUne spécialisation selon le type de risque\nChaque type de risque demande des compétences spécifiques. Le risque de marché concerne les fluctuations des prix, taux ou volatilités. Le risque de crédit évalue la probabilité qu’un emprunteur ne rembourse pas. Le risque opérationnel couvre les failles internes et événements externes. Enfin, le risque de liquidité mesure la capacité d’une banque à honorer ses engagements à court terme. Tous ces rôles sont essentiels à la stabilité financière d’une institution.\nDes parcours professionnels structurés mais diversifiés\nLes carrières débutent souvent par des fonctions d’analyse ou de reporting. En risque de marché, cela peut mener au coverage de desks, tandis qu’en risque de crédit, cela passe par l’analyse de bilans et peut évoluer vers des postes de direction sectorielle ou vers la gestion de fonds. Les chemins en risque opérationnel et en risque de liquidité sont plus récents, mais offrent des débouchés en cybersécurité, climat, ou trésorerie d’entreprise.\nDes compétences clés : rigueur, curiosité et quantitatif\nRéussir dans le risk management nécessite une curiosité naturelle pour les marchés, une compréhension fine des processus, et une forte compétence analytique. Le raisonnement mathématique, la connaissance des états financiers, l’évaluation des expositions, et la modélisation sont au cœur du métier. Un esprit structuré et un intérêt pour les systèmes financiers sont indispensables.\nUn bagage académique solide et des certifications reconnues\nLes recrues dans les départements de gestion des risques proviennent principalement de filières en finance, économie, droit ou comptabilité. Des certifications comme le FRM (Financial Risk Manager) ou le PRM (Professional Risk Manager) sont des atouts puissants, bien que nécessitant deux ans d’expérience. Le CFA est également présent, mais moins spécifique à cette spécialité.\nUne rémunération attractive, surtout à haut niveau\nD’après les données 2024, les analystes gagnent en moyenne $43K par an, tandis que les managing directors atteignent $595K. Si les salaires de base évoluent fortement avec l’expérience (de $36.8K à $325K), les bonus restent relativement modestes par rapport aux métiers du front-office. Ainsi, seuls 10 à 28% de la rémunération viennent des bonus, sauf pour les MD où cela grimpe à 46% environ.\nConclusion\nLa gestion des risques offre une carrière enrichissante, mêlant expertise technique et vision stratégique, avec des perspectives d’évolution et une rémunération compétitive. Moins intense que les métiers de trading ou de M&A, elle séduit aussi pour sa meilleure qualité de vie. Pour y entrer, il faut de la curiosité, de la rigueur, une base quantitative solide et, idéalement, viser les bonnes certifications.\n- Vues292",

    "text": "The Sela Tunnel, a vital infrastructure project connecting Guwahati in Assam to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Strategic importance of Sela TunnelConstructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at a cost of ₹825 crore, the tunnel holds strategic importance, providing year-round connectivity and significantly reducing travel time in the challenging terrain.Located at an altitude of 13,700 feet in the West Kameng district, the Sela Tunnel offers a lifeline for the region, especially the strategic Tawang area where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in December 2022. The road to Tawang, passing through the treacherous Sela mountain pass, posed severe challenges with temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius and heavy snowfall obstructing passage.World's longest twin-lane tunnel at an altitudeThe completed project is recognised as the world's longest twin-lane tunnel built at an altitude exceeding 13,000 feet. Comprising Tunnel 1 (a 980m single tube tunnel) and Tunnel 2 (a 1555m twin tube tunnel), the latter includes one bi-lane tube for traffic and an escape tube for emergencies. The tunnel system is complemented by a seven-kilometer approach road to Tunnel 1 and a 1.3-kilometer link road connecting Tunnel 1 to Tunnel 2.Described as an engineering marvel, the Sela Tunnel incorporates the new Austrian Tunnelling Method and adheres to the highest safety standards. The project aims to provide a faster and more efficient transport route, holding strategic significance for the country.The lack of motorable roads and rail connections in Arunachal Pradesh has been considered a disadvantage for India compared to China along the border in the northeast. The completion of the Sela Tunnel addresses this gap, ensuring all-weather connectivity to the Tawang region, a part contested by China.The Sela Tunnel holds historical importance, as during the 1962 war, Indian and Chinese forces clashed, resulting in the PLA overtaking Tawang town. The new infrastructure aims to enhance military preparedness by allowing seamless movement for personnel and equipment throughout the year.The recent order for Zorawar light tanks underscores the strategic significance of the Sela Tunnel, offering faster deployment along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the challenging terrain makes the use of main battle tanks like T-90, T-72, and Arjun impractical.Despite facing challenges during construction, including a major cloudburst in July that rendered approach roads inaccessible, the Sela Tunnel is ready for inauguration after a thorough third-party audit post the Silkyara tunnel cave-in in Uttarakhand last November.",
