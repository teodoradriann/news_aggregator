    "text": "Bogotá, 13 jun (EFE).- Un juez colombiano condenó a 64 meses de prisión al excandidato presidencial Rodolfo Hernández, que perdió las elecciones de 2022 con Gustavo Petro, por corrupción en la adjudicación de contratos cuando era alcalde de Bucaramanga (noreste).\nEn su decisión, el togado señaló que Hernández, de 79 años, fue hallado culpable, como autor directo, del \"delito de interés indebido en la celebración de contratos\", razón por la cual también fue inhabilitado para ejercer \"derechos y funciones públicas\" durante 80 meses.\nSegún el juez, Hernández es culpable de beneficiar a terceros en la adjudicación de un contrato para implementar nuevas tecnologías para tratar los residuos sólidos cuando fue alcalde de la ciudad de Bucaramanga, entre 2016 y 2019.\nEl exalcalde anunció que apelará la decisión de este juzgado de primera instancia.\nEl excandidato presidencial, que durante la audiencia en la que fue condenado reveló que padece un cáncer terminal, tenía un interés indebido en la asignación del contrato para el aprovechamiento y disposición final de residuos sólidos a la unión temporal Vitalogic RSU.\nEl objetivo era que con este contrato su hijo obtuviera beneficios económicos, por lo que Hernández se contactó con los representantes de la empresa que iba a implementar la nueva tecnología en Bucaramanga y les entregó información privilegiada para que tuvieran ventajas en la licitación.\nHernández, un magnate e ingeniero civil, irrumpió en la política nacional al presentarse como candidato a la Presidencia de Colombia en las elecciones de 2022 por el movimiento Liga de Gobernantes Anticorrupción con propuestas de corte populista anticorrupción.\nEso le valió pasar a segunda vuelta, en la que perdió con Petro, actual presidente de Colombia y cuyo mandato finalizará el 7 de agosto de 2026.\nGracias a ese resultado Hernández ganó un escaño en el Senado pero renunció dos meses después para enfocarse en el trabajo \"por el país\" desde su partido, con el que aspiró a la Gobernación del departamento de Santander el año pasado.",

    "text": "The deal would have raised wages by 25%, lowered employees’ share of health care costs, and boosted retirement contributions by the company. In addition, Boeing promised that the company's next plane would be built at its facilities in the Pacific northwest — rather than at Boeing's non-unionized plant in South Carolina. But many rank and file union members were unhappy with the offer, which fell short of the 40% raise and pension changes that the union was seeking. The strike vote comes at a difficult time for Boeing, which is already grappling with a safety crisis after a door plug panel blew out of a 737 Max jet in midair in January. That forced the company to slow production of its best-selling plane as it works to shore up quality control across its factories and supply chain, and rebuild trust with airlines, regulators and the flying public. Before the vote, new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg urged workers to approve the contract. “A strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together,” Ortberg said in a letter to employees in Washington and Oregon. The last strike by Boeing machinists in 2008 dragged on for eight weeks, costing the company an estimated $2 billion. Copyright 2024 NPR",
