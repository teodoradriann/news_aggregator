    "title": "Picking Up The Pieces: Ministry Founder Stays Positive, Even After Devastating Fire",
    "text": "Thursday, December 28th 2023, 3:40 pm A fire in Southwest Oklahoma City leaves a ministry without an operational building. News 9 spoke with the director of Grace United Urban Ministries, and some volunteers as they worked to clean up the debris, and salvage what they could from the fire. “We gotta keep moving because we have people depending on us, and we save lives - that's what we do,” said Donna Heins. Donna Heins runs Grace United Urban Ministries in south Oklahoma City, which provides services for those facing homelessness. She does what she can to help those living on the streets. “God, we have to figure out how we still feed people- that's just what I thought, even in this devastation,” said Heins. They serve around 40 people most days, but between their Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, they fed more than 700 people in need. “There's some good people on the street - and we're all just a paycheck away these days and times from being homeless,” said Heins. But her mission was interrupted last night when her building caught on fire. Oklahoma City firefighters responded around 6 p.m. on Wednesday, after the apartment above the ministry caught fire. The building that housed Grace United mostly just suffered water and smoke damage, but Heins says there was too much damage to save the building. But Donna's first thought wasn't fear or panic when she heard about the fire. She was immediately thinking about how she would continue her mission, even with the interruption. “I always know that God makes a way out of no way. I've seen it my whole life and that's how I tell my homeless people, you may be here today, but tomorrow if you make the right decision, you could be in a different place,” said Heins. Some of the people that Donna has helped through the years were at the building this morning to help clean up the damage and debris. “I've been on the streets for like 20 years and about a year ago she asked me to get off the street, I've been helping her ever since then,” said William Beaver. Beaver was moved into temporary housing after he decided he no longer wanted to live a life on the streets. “Last year when we did the emergency shelter, he said ‘I don't wanna go back to the street’ and I said, ‘Well come on home with us Beaver!’” said Heins “He's doing amazing, we're reuniting him with his mom and his family so he came to help today.” Now Beaver is returning the favor, helping Donna, like she helped him. “That's what it's all about, watching people change and do something different with their life,” said Heins. While there’s not much left for them to salvage, Donna says they will keep moving forward. “All I know is God is always with us, he has a plan,” said Heins. “We made it through the holidays, now we just gotta make it through the new year and it's just gonna be another adventure.” Oklahoma City firefighters are still working to determine the cause of the fire, but they do say it started in the apartment upstairs, above the building, and they say luckily nobody was hurt. Heins says they are now looking for a new building to rent, and she is hoping to stay in the Southwest OKC / Capitol Hill area.

    "text": "Hoops star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander named CP male athlete of the year\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander took 2023 by storm, blossoming into a superstar on both the NBA and international stages.\nThe basketball star from Hamilton has added another feather to his cap, coming out on top of an impressive field to be named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\nGilgeous-Alexander broke out in 2022-23 with the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder, who exceeded expectations by almost squeezing into the playoffs. This season, with Gilgeous-Alexander leading the way, the Thunder are currently second in a competitive Western Conference.\nHe also led Canada to its first-ever FIBA World Cup medal in September, earning bronze with a win over the United States. Canada’s performance at the tournament earned it its first Olympic berth since 2000.\n“Representing Hamilton and helping grow the game of basketball in Canada is one of the true joys of playing in the NBA, and I greatly appreciate the recognition from The Canadian Press with this award,” he said in a statement.\n“One thing I take great pride in is my work ethic, and with the Thunder I try to bring my best every single day to make my home country proud.”\nThe 25-year-old finished with 12 votes in a survey of sports journalists and broadcasters across the country, placing just ahead of Edmonton Oilers captain and NHL superstar Connor McDavid (11). Golfer Nick Taylor, who won the Canadian Open this year, and decathlon world champion Pierce LePage were tied for third (10).\n“A tough call with so many deserving candidates, but we haven’t seen this kind of NBA excellence from a Canadian since Steve Nash,” said Postmedia sports columnist Tim Baines. “Even brighter days ahead.”\nThe 2022-23 season was Gilgeous-Alexander’s fifth in the NBA. He finished fourth in the league in scoring (31.4) playing 68 games, his first time competing in more than 56 since his sophomore year.\nThe Thunder finished 10th in the West and made it to the play-in tournament, but fell short of the playoffs after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, Gilgeous-Alexander made his first all-star team — the fourth Canadian to do so — and first team all-NBA for his efforts, becoming the second Canadian to receive all-NBA honours alongside Nash.\nGilgeous-Alexander carried the momentum of his NBA play into the summer with the Canadian team. He averaged 24.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists, and 1.6 steals in eight games at the FIBA World Cup to be named a tournament all-star. He will be looking to lead Canada to the podium at the 2024 Paris Games.\n“Playing for Team Canada is an honour, and being a part of the squad that won bronze at the World Cup is a career highlight, but I can’t wait to put the work in to aim for greater heights in Paris in 2024,” Gilgeous-Alexander said.\nHis run included a 31-point, 12-assist performance in the overtime win over the Americans in the bronze-medal game.\n“Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, I think very clearly could have easily been the MVP of that tournament,” said Canada men’s general manager Rowan Barrett.\nGilgeous-Alexander has upped the ante in 2023-24, and has brought the upstart Thunder along with him.\nOklahoma City has exceeded expectations once again, boasting a 19-9 record.\nMeanwhile, Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named the winner of the 2023 Northern Star Award as top Canadian athlete earlier this month, is third in the NBA at 31.1 points per contest and leads the league in steals at 2.8 a night. He’s the NBA’s lone player averaging two or more steals and averages close to one block per game (0.8) as a six-foot-six point guard.\n“Amazing. Amazing,” Denver Nuggets guard and fellow Canadian Jamal Murray said. “Playing really well — on both ends of the floor, as well, which I think most people talk about (offence).\n“He’s just always aggressive, he’s always a threat out there every time you guard him.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",
