    "text": "‘We’re being penalised’: Breast cancer survivor reveals medical screening double standard\nA breast cancer survivor is calling out a double standard with medical screenings, saying she feels penalised for being diagnosed with cancer.\nDebbie Swain revealed that women who have been diagnosed are expected to pay almost $500 for a mammogram, while women who don’t have cancer get the screening for free.\n“It should be free. To all women, as it is before cancer. I said we’ve all gone through this, and we’re being penalised. So somebody without cancer doesn’t pay, but somebody with does,” she told 4BC Afternoons.\nShe added that because it hadn’t been five years and she hadn’t been declared cancer-free, she’s forced to pay out of pocket because BreastScreen Australia won’t see her.\n“There will be women who are deterred from having vital checkups if they find themselves in a similar situation to you and are skipping those checks because they simply don’t have the money to pay for it,” Sofie Formica added.\nHear more highlights from Sofie Formica below and download the 4BC App on iOS or Android to ensure you don’t miss a thing!\nImage: iStock.\nDownload this podcast\nhere",

    "title": "Greenbrier East High School Engineering and Design Team Inventors Get Ready for MIT",
    "text": "By Annette Slonaker ,\n4 hours ago GREENBRIER COUNTY W.Va. (WVDN) – The Greenbrier East Engineering and Design Team presented the public with two incredible inventions that will better the world we live in, today and tomorrow. Their mid-project review was unveiled at The Cecil Underwood Building at the State Fairgrounds. Although this was a midterm display, the teams wanted to show off their designs that would make life easier, better, safer and more tolerable for some. Team Alpha has invented an adjustable height wheelchair that lifts the rider to an adjustable height to enter and exit the chair. Team Delta has created a mask-integrated thermal imaging system (MITIS) for firefighters, that will allow them to see thermal images and remain hands-free. Under the tutelage of instructor Kevin Warfield, the sky is no longer the limit for East grads.\nTeam Alpha is composed of team managers Delaney Hamrick and Braedon Spangler, communications lead Delaney Hamrick and co-lead Kyliegh Swearingen. In sustainability, the lead is James Yarnell and the co-lead is Kendra Culyer. The technical team is: lead, Nate Smith, co-lead Hailey Ervin, Braedon Spangler and Rodrigo Mendieta-Servin and finally in the research department the lead is Rob Bennett and co-lead is Westen Pence. Together this team was tasked with finding a solution to any given problem. After many discussions and voting sessions, the team decided to invent the Adjustable Height Wheelchair in order to assist wheelchair-bound individuals’ access and transfer to elevated surfaces. The team incorporated a lift under the seat of a wheelchair, powered by a 12-volt battery. This invention will help riders with vertical mobility issues. Imagine a chair that sits at the normal 3-foot level, like a countertop or stove. The individual would be able to push a button and be lifted to the height of a cupboard or medicine cabinet, per se. Also, to assist with getting in and out of bed, simple reaching or taller tables and such. Observers were given a demonstration. Although the invention is in its middle stages, keep your eyes open for this mind-marrowing creation!\nTeam Delta is team managers Rylee Carver and Caden Carver. In communications, there is lead Olivia Warfield and co-leads Delaney Hamrick and Cole Morgan. Technicians are lead Braedon Spangler and co-leads Chris Harrah and Jacob Grim. In research are lead Jacob Grim and co-lead Ashley Mendez. Finally, in sustainability, lead Amelia Hanna and co-lead Ashley Mendez. After many voting sessions and ruling out other designs, the team decided to help firefighters. The design invented is an integrated thermal imaging system (MITIS) that will display a thermal image of what the firefighter is viewing while allowing them to be hands-free. The face-plate mounted thermal camera, outputs real-time data to an integrated screen and camera so that technicians or other firefighters can see what he/she sees, as well as the wearer. This can allow the firefighter to see heat-producing victims, heat in a wall or behind a door. A battery is also planned to fit on the mask that will power the camera and screen. This is an invaluable tool for any rescue person and can save many lives, both in civilian and EMS environments. Their ultimate goal is to increase firefighters’ dexterity and efficiency during a fire rescue situation.\nThe two teams are part of The Lemelson-MIT Invention Education Capstone Course.\n“The Lemelson-MIT Program (LMIT) is a national leader in advancing invention education. LMIT has helped thousands of students and educators learn to invent and has recognized hundreds of collegiate and mid-career inventors for over 25 years. [Their] research offers evidence that [their] creative, transdisciplinary problem-solving approach known as invention education helps students of all backgrounds develop interest, confidence and capabilities in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).” Patents have been awarded to students across the U.S. who are involved with LMIT as well as many other awards and accolades. Lemelson-MIT InvenTeams is an initiative of the Lemelson-MIT Program that awards annual grants of up to $7,500 each to teams of high-school students, teachers and mentors to invent technological solutions to real-world problems. To afford West Virginia Students the same opportunities is a feat taken on by instructor Kevin Warfield. With his teachers looking on, Warfield spoke of his seven years being involved with LMIT and his third trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the InvenTeams will gather for the show. The two East teams will leave on June 10 making their way to Cambridge with their incredible inventions in tow.\nThe Engineering and Design Course is available to all high school students beginning in Freshman year and can be taken each year until graduation, as an elective. This class does earn credit for high school students. This is an incredible opportunity for any student who has an interest in engineering, CAD, science, computer science and computational thinking, making, inventing, entrepreneurship and the arts which will better the world they live in.\nDonations are graciously accepted both monetarily and otherwise by reaching out to Kevin Warfield or East Engineering at Greenbrier East High School, BWarfield@K12.wv.us , calling 304-647-6464 ext.,1509 or follow their journeys on Facebook at Greenbrier East Engineering and Design. Not all the needs are met through funding for the bus, hotels, food, MIT Tees and more; and you never know if a project they’re working on may find the working part in your garage!\nThe students and instructors alike, were proud to display their minds’ work and to represent West Virginia well at MIT in June!\nThe post Greenbrier East High School Engineering and Design Team Inventors Get Ready for MIT appeared first on West Virginia Daily News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
