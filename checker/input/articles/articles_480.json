    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Fajita Pete’s, the “fresh off the grill” fajita catering and delivery concept, has joined forces with Clutch Creator, a smart website platform, to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities into its catering platform. This strategic move is a testament to Fajita Pete'scommitment to continuous innovation during a time of exciting technological developments occurring within the restaurant industry.\nNearly 30% of Fajita Pete’s annual revenue is generated by home and office caterings with average tickets hovering around the $500 mark. Founder Pedro “Pete” Mora notes, “Catering is our bread and butter. The young kids we used to cater for 15 years ago are now hosting college graduation and office parties today. It is for these customers, and the thousands of other catering customers who trust us with their special events, that we chose to continue to invest in our catering platform. And, as one of them told me recently, you can’t spell fajita without A and I.”\nKey highlights of the partnership include:\n● Reducing decisions down to a single prompt: The integration of AI enables customers to answer a single prompt about their event, and AI will generate their entire catering order. What used to require 85 decisions is now reduced to a single prompt.\n● Predictive ordering: Leveraging data from thousands of previous Fajita Pete’s caterings, AI predicts customer preferences to streamline the ordering process. This predictive ordering feature ensures that customers receive personalized and relevant suggestions based on historical choices.\n● Time efficiency: With this new AI-powered platform, customers can place catering orders in less than half the time compared to traditional and cumbersome methods of adding items to baskets on an individual basis.\n“Our partnership with Clutch Creator and the integration of AI into our catering platform demonstrate our ongoing commitment to providing an exceptional customer experience,\" said Hugh Guill, Chief Brand Officer of Fajita Pete’s. \"Catering is a cornerstone of our business, and this technological enhancement not only simplifies the ordering process for our patrons, but also gives us the best chance to exceed their expectation by recommending the ‘perfect’ order.”\nFajita Pete’s will pilot the program in select markets in Q1 of 2024 prior to a full brand roll-out later in the year.\nAbout Fajita Pete’s\nFajita Pete's is a Houston-based \"fresh off the grill\" fajita concept focused on a simple menu with premium-quality, handmade menu items. Founder Pete Mora envisioned a better way to serve guests by focusing on catering, delivery and takeout, a model that has proven successful since 2008.

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Blackford County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Blackford County, Indiana from 1901-2000 was 29.3. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Blackford County, Indiana experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Blackford County, Indiana history.",
