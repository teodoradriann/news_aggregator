    "text": "A monsignor on a motorcycle, a rabbi who escaped the Holocaust, and priests who pack heat: Meet the chaplains of the LAPD\nCNN, KCAL, KCBS, KABC\nBy Mike Valerio and Amber Sumpter, CNN\nLos Angeles (CNN) — Dividing time between his parish and his police family in the City of Angels, there’s a monsignor with a motorcycle, a man who’s both devoted to God – and a devotee of Harleys.\nMonsignor Frank Hicks revs the engine of his 2002 Harley Davidson V-Rod, the roar echoing through the underground garage of his Los Angeles church like a chrome crescendo.\n“There was a retreat for 70 to 80 police officers, and we rode these bikes through the desert to Furnace Creek in Death Valley,” Hicks recalled, gesturing to his other Harleys kept underneath St. Basil’s Catholic Church.\n“A monsignor riding a motorcycle is rather unusual, but being with officers in those types of circumstances, you’ll get a much freer interaction.”\nCultivating trust with officers, whether it’s in the Mojave Desert or at an active crime scene, is a key part of Hicks’ position outside parish walls, a crucial component of his mission with the Los Angeles Police Department Chaplain Corps.\nThe corps enlists 47 chaplains – most of whom are volunteers – representing Buddhist, Catholic, Interfaith, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant and Taoist faiths.\nThe convergence of religion in a job where trauma is a near-daily occurrence offers a distinct form of counseling, making these chaplains at one of the country’s largest police departments a different kind of first responder. LAPD chaplains work to build trust and break down stigmas around fears and emotions, in a job that has historically viewed such topics as signs of weakness.\nEach police chaplain performs a solemn duty: delivering deeply needed solace, spiritual guidance and compassion toward police officers who face relentless pressures and emotional strains.\n“My presence among officers means that someone cares, the community cares,” Hicks said. “I see human beings, people who are trying to do their best. And I just want to walk with them.”\nLess preaching, more listening\nThe chaplain corps in Los Angeles mirrors a national trend, as law enforcement agencies turn to chaplains as a supplemental and, advocates say, meaningful part of bolstering resiliency within the ranks.\n“Since 2020, we’ve grown to more than 600 chaplains in 32 states,” said Mendy Coën, director general of the\nUnited States Chaplain Corps, an organization that trains clergy to serve in police, firefighting, health care and aviation settings.\n“There is a burning need for chaplains in police departments across all 50 states,” Coën said. “There’s often a stigma if officers seek help for mental health needs. So chaplains, while they’re no replacement for clinicians, they’re often the first line of defense, a compassionate ear, a confidential source, before the doctors or the E.R.”\nIn terms of understanding the rigors of the job, 10 of the LAPD chaplains also work cases and patrol the city as sworn officers – pastors who pack heat.\nThe group of 10 includes the department’s chief chaplain, Officer Kenneth Crawford, who says the duties of chaplaincy are less about liturgy, and more about listening.\n“I’m not there to speak sermons to them, I’m not there to try to overwhelm them with whatever I believe theologically,” Crawford said. “I’m there to just be that person who will listen to them, that they can depend on. And hopefully, the experience I have in life and ministry will help them through their difficult times.”\nCrawford described police chaplains as sources of light during dark times for law enforcement. In a survey study published in October 2020, 12% of Dallas-Fort Worth police officers reported a lifetime mental health diagnosis. In the same survey,\npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 26% reported current symptoms of mental illness.\nFrom 2017 to 2021,\nFirst H.E.L.P., a non-profit that tracks law enforcement suicide data, reported 756 officer suicides. The figure is nearly triple the number of officers who were feloniously, not accidentally, killed in the line of duty during the same time period, the FBI said.\n“We chaplains are a human entity. We’re there if officers are overwhelmed with issues personally, professionally, or with their families,” Crawford said.\n“[If officers are] avoiding talking about PTSD, if you’re not able to debrief, if you’re not able to talk about it, if you’re not able to process it, those feelings bottle up in you,” Crawford added. “And then it’s one stress on top of another.”\nBecoming a cop of the cloth\nWith incredibly high stakes tied to the mental health of first responders, LAPD officials detailed a multistep vetting process to become a chaplain.\nOfficer Mike McCarty, a 29-year LAPD veteran who serves as the department’s chaplain coordinator, said candidates are first interviewed by the corps’ eight-person advisory board.\n“If a candidate is qualified, and they must be an ordained minister by a credible school, then a background investigation will be conducted by a LAPD officer,” McCarty said. Then a candidate will be assigned to an area for a “two-year probationary time,” he added.\nMembers of the corps are later issued a LAPD chaplains badge, a uniform, and finally – a bulletproof vest.\nThe vests are worn when chaplains join officers on patrols, as members of the corps are deployed to hostage situations, crime scenes and fatal vehicle crashes.\n“I think if we didn’t have our chaplains, there would indeed be a sense of loss,” said Capt. Aaron Ponce. “And that loss being, an extra layer of resilience, an extra layer of outreach, that extra layer of officers having somebody else who’s familiar with the stresses of law enforcement.”\n“This is a different opportunity for our officers to connect,” Ponce added. “Whether it be for spiritual advice, or whether it’s just for a listening ear.”\nAt a time when law enforcement faces recruitment challenges nationwide, the LAPD chaplain corps has a waiting list of 20 people, officials with the department reported.\nThe number of chaplains at the department is now the largest among its peer police departments in Chicago and New York – the first and second largest police departments in the country, with Los Angeles following in third. The Chicago Police Department employs six chaplains and the New York Police Department employs 12 within its ranks, spokespersons from both departments confirmed.\nBuilding camaraderie\nPerhaps the most essential moments of chaplaincy described by officers and members of the corps are assurances that struggles from witnessing pain and the healing of spiritual wounds are both timeless and can be overcome.\n“I approach our solemn duty by trying to talk to officers as if I were their brother,” said Rabbi Israel Hirsch, who celebrated his 90th birthday in October. “I think that’s the most important thing, for officers to know that there’s somebody there who is thinking of them, who is with them.”\nHirsch is a survivor of the Holocaust and a veteran of the Korean War. The nonagenarian is now seen as a fixture within the LAPD’s police station in North Hollywood and says both trust and consequential conversations often come from the genius of a simple overture.\n“We schmooze!” laughed Hirsch, reveling in years of swapped stories and precious camaraderie with officers.\n“That, in its most essential form, is the best part of being a chaplain,” Hirsch said. “The fact that I can help somebody, see some progress in their demeanor, and see a change for the better in how they look at life.”\nIn January 2022,\noff-duty officer Fernando Arroyos was shot and killed while the 27-year-old looked for a new house with his girlfriend. Arroyos was based in the same police station where Monsignor Hicks serves as a chaplain.\n“I would say the bulk of the department contacted me personally and wanted to get perspective on it so that they could have some understanding,” Hicks said.\n“I tried to impress upon them that, this is a perfect love story,” Hicks offered. “To love someone without having any reservations, to realize their life was important, and that it had been needlessly taken from the community, from their family, and from them.”\nAs he stood before a portrait of Arroyos in the corridors of the Olympic police station, Hicks said the guidance he offers officers is always ongoing.\n“No matter how long that takes, I will be present, I will be available to them.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "It may feel like school just let out for summer break, but in three weeks, several East Valley school districts will be welcoming students back into buildings.\nEvery year, ABC15 receives questions and comments from families, wondering why school starts in July and August when it’s scorching hot in Arizona. ABC15 went to the education experts to see how a school calendar is determined.\nChandler Unified and Apache Junction Unified are the two school districts that start the earliest, from what ABC15 gathered, compared to the rest of the Valley, on July 16. More East Valley school districts start that week, with more to follow in the weeks after.\nArizona’s largest school district, Mesa Public Schools, has its first day on July 31 alongside a few other unified school districts. Additional districts start the first week of August.\n“July 31, already? It hasn’t even reached August and they have to go back to school,” one mom told ABC15.\n“It’s crazy because it’s too hot,” said Susan, a mom of two Chandler students.\nChandler Unified Superintendent Frank Narducci said his district is on what’s called a modified year-round schedule for 30 years now, meaning the district gets two-week breaks in the fall, winter and spring.\n“Usually with year-round, you have three-week intercessions,” he said. “But because our community valued a little longer summer, we went with the modified year-round.”\nNarducci said the district, among a few others, has committees that help determine school calendars. In Chandler, they’re done in five-year cycles, so the calendar this year has been set in stone for quite some time.\nDepending on the district, decisions are made based on goals they may want, which, in Chandler and other education experts' added, districts want to be done by Memorial Day.\n“Our calendar committee valued Memorial Day as the end of the school year for this set of calendars, so it was worked back from that,” Narducci said. “They used that as a nonnegotiable and that’s the date.”\nDistricts are required to have 180 learning days, or equivalent in hours, as some districts are on four-day schedules.\n“The committee takes the 180 days and they divide them up from semesters. The one condition they have is there is equality between the learning segments, so they have ample time to be taught during that time,” Narducci continued. “That’s up to the committee to divide that up and they have to look at where holidays fall.”\nWhile school starts soon for students, the worry with the heat is there, and Narducci said he knows it’s hot in Arizona.\n“We do realize that. And so, we try to take every precaution we can,” he said.\nDo you have a concern in your community or a news tip? We want to hear from you!\nConnect with us: share@abc15.com\nSchools follow what’s called a heat index. There’s a chart and guidelines that are sent out every day from county health officials to school leaders when it’s hot, and it helps them determine whether to limit time outside for students and instead have alternative activities indoors for recess.\nNarducci said buses are air-conditioned and they hope families can help their students be heat-ready.\n“We live around the corner, so either we drive them or we walk. But if it’s too hot, we have to take them in a car,” Susan said.\nEducators and health officials urge families to help their students stay hydrated and to drink enough water.\n“We’re asking our coaches and our teachers, be aware of those signals and signs. Listen to kids, if they’re complaining of a headache or if you see a distressed student, make sure they’re getting shade, make sure they’re staying inside. Make sure they’re properly hydrated,” Narducci said.\nDr. Shane Rainey, a pediatric hospitalist at Banner Children’s, said signs of heat illness in kids could occur later than in adults.\n“Things like being faint or being dizzy or passing out, even, or things like excessive sweating or having cool, pale, clammy skin and fast heart rates and just feeling unwell, nausea… Those types of things are something to move to a cooler place and drink some cold water and try to cool off,” Rainey said.\nFor students who have to walk to school, Rainey said they should try and walk in shaded areas, if possible.\n“If you can, definitely wear a hat. Sunscreen is definitely very important. Anything SPF 30 or higher to protect from that intense sun you see. Carry a water bottle, drink water the whole way, particularly when you're outside or when you're walking, and take frequent breaks if you need to,” Rainey advised.",

    "text": "Viareggio, 6 marzo 2025 – Blackout a ripetizione in via San Martino e aree limitrofe. Ma soprattutto, nessuna indicazione sui tempi di risoluzione dei problemi che causano disagi enormi a residenti e attività . Nella seconda metà del 2024, è successo un paio di volte che la corrente andasse via in modo prolungato, tanto da causare problemi a chi lavora e vive in zona. Da una settimana, però, il fenomeno si è intensificato e di parecchio, con la luce che salta a botte da 3-4 ore .\nAlla braceria Amaro, già nel fine settimana, sia sabato che domenica, ci sono stati dei problemi che hanno compromesso il servizio . Lunedì, giorno di chiusura del locale, i disagi sono stati minimi, ma la corrente è mancata comunque: “Abbiamo spostato il giorno di chiusura dalla domenica al lunedì per il corso di Carnevale – spiega Daniele Belluomini, uno dei titolari – e per due ore la signora che si occupa delle pulizie si è trovata a lavorare al buio . So che altre attività hanno dovuto far fronte ai problemi: un negozio non ha potuto usare il Pos e ha dovuto respingere tutti i pagamenti che non fossero in contanti, mentre le attività di ristorazione si sono trovate con i frigoriferi spenti”. Nella giornata di lunedì, il blackout prolungato ha interessato anche il centro diagnostico di via Sant’Andrea. Oltre alle attività, lo scotto della prolungata assenza di corrente è stato pagato anche dai residenti. “Una signora anziana che abita vicino al nostro locale – continua Belluomini – è stata per diverse ore senza luce nel corso della notte, a non ha potuto portare al bagno il marito che non si può muovere in maniera autonoma. Ha dovuto aspettare che aprisse il fruttivendolo che ha vicino casa per farsi aiutare”.\nFin qui, la cronaca del lunedì. Poi arriva martedì, giorno dell’ultimo corso mascherato e di numeri importanti, in termini di prenotazioni , per la braceria Amaro. Se non che, in pieno servizio, poco dopo le 13, la luce salta di nuovo. “Alla fine, a malincuore, abbiamo dovuto mandare via i clienti – racconta ancora il titolare – perdendo una trentina di coperti . Così non possiamo più lavorare, e oggi (martedì per chi legge; ndr ) mi sta salendo l’ansia al pensiero del servizio serale. Abbiamo bisogno che qualcuno ci dia una mano: non è possibile dover passare le mezzore al telefono per dei guasti. Se sanno che esiste un problema, devono garantire una squadra di pronto intervento”.\nIl fatto è che nonostante i solleciti, il problema non si sa da dove provenga: si parla dei lavori in via San Martino o, in alternativa, di quelli in via Mazzini, con l’asfalto ancora da posare . E si arriva a ieri mattina, quando arriva la doccia gelata. Attaccato alla porta d’ingresso della braceria c’è un foglio della compagnia dell’elettricità che informa che per la sera stessa è programmata la sospensione della fornitura di corrente, fino alle 21.30. “Ma noi abbiamo delle prenotazioni fermate da due mesi, tra cui due compleanni – spiega Alberto Belluomini, l’altro titolare –; non è possibile essere informati di una cosa del genere la mattina stessa. Io che dovrei fare adesso? Chiamare i clienti e dire loro di non venire? Chiedergli di posticipare la prenotazione? E se i lavori alle 21 non sono terminati? Così è oggettivamente impossibile lavorare . Al di là del mancato incasso per un servizio che salta, e che si calcola comunque nell’ordine di qualche migliaio di euro se il locale è pieno, un imprevisto può succedere una volta, due volte a esser larghi. Così stiamo facendo delle figurette e non va bene. Ci devono dire come intendono risolvere il problema”.\n DanMan",
