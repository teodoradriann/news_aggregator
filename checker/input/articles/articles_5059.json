    "title": "​Breast Cancer Symptoms: 5 symptoms women can catch early if they stay alert​",
    "text": "When it comes to breast cancer, catching those signals early could literally save your life. Yet, many women shrug off or miss early signs because they don’t seem like a big deal at first. This isn’t a lecture. It’s more like a heart-to-heart with your bestie who’s telling you, “Hey, maybe check that out.” Because while awareness campaigns scream about monthly self-exams, pink ribbons, and mammograms (all important, by the way), what we don’t talk about enough are the sneaky, weird, not-so-obvious symptoms that women spot way too late.\nLet’s talk about 5 breast cancer symptoms you can actually catch early—if you’re just a little more tuned in to your body.\nWe tend to blame everything on bras, sweat, or hormones. Your nipple itches? “Must be the detergent.” There’s a rash? “Probably just eczema.” It’s leaking? “Wait, what?” Exactly.\nEarly breast cancer can mess with your nipples in subtle ways. A sudden change in shape or position; your nipple starts turning inward when it never did before? That’s not just age. Crusting, scaling, or persistent rash; especially if it’s just one nipple and refuses to go away with creams. Unexplained discharge; and we’re not talking post-pregnancy leaks here. If there’s clear or bloody fluid and you’re not lactating, that’s a big deal. It’s so easy to chalk these off as nothing, but don’t. Your nipples are like tiny messengers. Don’t silence them with excuses.\nEveryone’s obsessed with finding a lump—and yes, that’s a classic sign. But the truth is, many breast cancers don’t start as obvious, round, hard bumps.\nSometimes, it’s more like a thickened area you only notice while showering, a part of your breast that feels denser or firmer than the rest, something that wasn’t there before but isn’t exactly a “lump.” Here’s a little truth bomb: women with dense breasts (which is super common, especially in younger women) already have tissue that feels lumpy or ropey. So, catching a new irregularity requires some familiarity. You’ve got to know your own terrain. This is where self-checks come in—but with a twist.\nDon’t poke and prod once a month like it’s a chore. Just get used to how your boobs normally feel. That way, if something changes, your hands will catch it before it turns into something bigger.\nThis one’s straight out of the “wait, what?” category. One of the more alarming early signs is skin dimpling, especially if it starts to resemble the surface of an orange. Doctors call it “peau d’orange,” and it’s usually caused by something blocking the lymphatic drainage in your breast—often a tumor.\nThis isn’t a surface-level skin issue like a pimple or heat rash. You’ll notice tiny pits or bumps that make your skin look bumpy or stretched, swelling around that area and maybe a little redness or warmth. It’s often painless, and that’s the trap. No pain = no action. But if your breast starts resembling fruit, it’s time to get it checked. Skin is the largest organ, and when it starts changing shape or texture, it’s usually reacting to something deeper beneath the surface.\nWe’ve all been there. Your boobs feel sore, tender, achy—classic signs your period’s about to show up. But what happens when that ache lingers? Or it shows up in just one breast? Or it hits you out of cycle?\nBreast pain (also called mastalgia) isn’t always cancer. In fact, it rarely is. But here’s where it gets tricky: when breast cancer does cause pain, it’s usually localized to one specific spot, sharp or burning instead of dull and achy and not tied to your period. Most people don’t associate cancer with pain, but that’s a myth. Some women report ongoing discomfort in one breast months before diagnosis—pain that was dismissed as “nothing.” If it sticks around and keeps nagging you, especially if it’s new or focused in one area, trust your gut and talk to your doc.\nHere’s something most people don’t realize: your breast tissue extends all the way up into your armpit, and there are loads of lymph nodes there. If something’s going wrong in your breast, your armpit might be the first place to show signs.\nKeep an eye out for swelling or puffiness under your arm, a lump near your armpit or collarbone and a weird heaviness or “full” feeling on one side. The lymphatic system is like your body’s drainage system. When it gets blocked or affected—say, by cancer cells—things start backing up. Early breast cancer might sneak into the lymph nodes before it shows up clearly in the breast itself. So, if your armpit suddenly feels tender or “off,” don’t ignore it.\nLife is chaotic. Most of us are juggling jobs, families, relationships, and daily survival. Who has time to obsess over every tiny change in their body? But here’s the thing: early breast cancer doesn’t always come with drama. There’s no dramatic lump or sudden sickness. It’s subtle. Sneaky. Almost polite.\nThat’s why women catch it late—not because they’re careless, but because the early signs look like stuff we deal with all the time. A rash, a bit of swelling, mild pain. Nothing screams “cancer” right away.\nAnd yet, early detection is the single most powerful tool we have. Breast cancer found early has a five-year survival rate of over 90%. That’s not just a number—that’s more time with your family, more birthdays, more life.\nHere’s your no-nonsense plan:\nKnow your boobs like your favorite playlist. You don’t need a calendar reminder or a checklist. Just check in regularly—while showering, dressing, lying in bed. Learn what’s normal for you.\nDon’t Google. Talk to your doctor. If something feels weird, resist the urge to consult Dr. Internet. Book that appointment. Even if it’s nothing, peace of mind is priceless.\nPush for tests if you’re uneasy. Sometimes, symptoms are dismissed—especially if you're young or don’t have a family history. Advocate for yourself. If you feel something’s off, push for a scan, a second opinion, whatever it takes.\nPay attention to patterns. Is that nipple rash sticking around for more than two weeks? Is that pain getting worse, not better? Patterns help you connect dots that a one-time event might not.\nTalk about it. Mention it to your sister, your best friend, your group chat. Women talking about breast changes openly can save lives. You never know who might read your story and realize they’ve been ignoring the same thing.\nYou don’t need to be paranoid. You don’t need to turn every itch into an emergency. But you do need to listen to your body. And when it whispers, don’t wait for it to scream. Because early breast cancer isn’t invisible. It’s just really good at pretending to be something else. And you? You’re smarter than that. You’re paying attention now. So here’s to being breast-aware—not because we live in fear, but because we care too much not to notice.",

    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - A San Jose man on Thursday plead guilty to three counts of arson on federal property, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced. Gary Stephen Maynard, 49, engaged in an arson spree in the Shasta Trinity National Forest and in the vicinity of the then-ongoing Dixie Fire in the Lassen National Forest, according to court documents. Maynard set some of his fires behind firefighters who were actively fighting the Dixie Fire, effectively surrounding these firefighters as they responded to the Dixie Fire. Maynard admitted to setting the following fires during this arson spree: the Cascade Fire (July 20, 2021), the Everitt Fire (July 21, 2021), the Ranch Fire (Aug. 7, 2021), and the Conard Fire (Aug. 7, 2021). This case is the product of an investigation by the U.S. Forest Service with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, CalFire, the California Highway Patrol, and the Lassen County Sheriff's Department. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shea Kenny, Sam Stefanki, and Michael Anderson are prosecuting the case. Maynard is scheduled to be sentenced on May 9, 2024, by U.S. District Judge Daniel J. Calabretta. Maynard faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count to which he pleaded guilty.",

    "text": "NEW YORK: The US has accused Russia of discussing weapon transfers with Houthis, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping are holding hostage a vital commercial waterway.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking said Moscow was “cutting its deals” with the Houthis to allow their ships to sail through the Red Sea unharmed.\n“We have confirmation that the Russians and the Houthis are in dialogue about ways to cooperate,” including on weapon transfers, Lenderking said.\n“We don’t know that weapons are being transferred as we speak, but it’s come to the point that we’re all sounding the alarm bell to ensure this does not happen,” he added.\nIf the weapon transfers were to materialize, it “could potentially change the conflict in a significant manner,” Lenderking said, warning of “an escalation” that would derail already stalled efforts to end Yemen’s war.\n“The notion that the Russians would provide the Houthis with lethal weapons is deeply alarming to the countries of the region,” he said.\nRussia has been stepping up military relationships with Iran and North Korea, both under heavy sanctions, as it seeks to bolster its arsenal in its war in Ukraine.\nRussia’s relationship with the US has deteriorated sharply since the invasion of Ukraine, with Washington leading the West in slapping sanctions on Moscow and arming Kyiv.\nThe Houthis have been firing drones and missiles at ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November, saying they are targeting vessels linked to Israel, the US, and Britain in a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nThe Houthi campaign has killed at least four sailors and sunk two ships.\nOne vessel — the Galaxy Leader — was hijacked in November and continues to be held by the Houthis along with its 25 international crew.",

    "text": "The top 10 quotes from postgame scene after Ohio State won national championship\nATLANTA — Ohio State is the national champion of college football. The party is still ongoing ahead of the celebration inside the Horseshoe on Sunday.\nAnd the postgame coverage is still nowhere near complete. With that in mind, Lettermen Row is putting together a list of 10 quotes, some funny, some sentimental, some serious and some just outrageous from the postgame celebrations on the field and inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium locker room after a national title win.\nLet’s break down the 10 best quotes Lettermen Row — or other outlets — heard as the confetti was settling Monday night.\n10. Will Howard on what it means to win a national title for Buckeyes\nRex Kern, a 10th-round pick, was what the program needed under Woody Hayes in 1968 and won a national title. Flash forward to 2002, when Craig Krenzel, a fifth-round pick, helped the Buckeyes capture a title. Of course, everyone remembers Cardale Jones for his immaculate run through the four-team CFP. He became a fourth-round draft choice after winning his title in 2014.\nWelcome to the club, Will Howard.\n“It’s humbling,” Howard said Tuesday morning after the Monday night game and celebration. “Coming to Ohio State, obviously the expectation and the goal is in the end to win a National Championship. The fact that we’re sitting here today as national champions, it’s surreal, man. You’ve got to really just take it in and thank God for the opportunity to be here and for the opportunity to be on this stage with these guys that I love. We’re going to be brothers for the rest of our lives because of this. We are bonded for life.\n“It’s more than blood now, man. We’ve got rings to show for it, and we’re going to be able to get together and tell this story of this team for years to come. I’m just so blessed that I was able to come here and be a part of something like this.”\n9. Emeka Egbuka shares what he wants his legacy to be\nEmeka Egbuka broke the Ohio State all-time receptions record during the national title game, passing K.J. Hill (2016-2019). Hill had 201. Egbuka ended his career with 205.\nBut he knows that record will be broken eventually, maybe even by Jeremiah Smith. So Lettermen Row wanted to know what his legacy is for the Buckeyes program.\n“I think my legacy here and what I want Buckeye fans and the whole state of Ohio to remember me for is how I glorify Jesus on the field,” Egbuka said. “That was really my only goal. I tried to do that the best way I could. I came up short many, many times in my career. That can mean more to me than any record could.”\n8. Buckeyes early-enrollee OL wants to meet LeBron\nLakers star and one of the best basketball players of all time LeBron James was in a suite for the game, watching his favorite college football team win a national title.\nSome of the players hoped James would come down to the field and join the celebration after the game.\nEarly-enrollee offensive lineman Jayvon McFadden, a four-star recruit who signed with the program in December and will be on the team next season, asked one of his fellow early-enrollees: “Where LeBron at?”\nHe left, Jayvon. Maybe you’ll get to meet him eventually, but it wasn’t going to be after this title game win.\n7. Ryan Day loves Ohio State\n“It’s an honor to be the head coach at Ohio State,” he said Tuesday morning. “I’d probably say that this job is not for everybody, and every year I’ve learned more about myself than I thought going into the season. A big part of it is these players, and I shared that with the guys this season.\n“I felt like we were knocking on the door several times leading up to this game. You think about the ’19 team, you think about the ’20 team. Every year I felt like we were close, but we just couldn’t get through. This team was different. This team was special. The message was to leave no doubt. Don’t leave it to one play, don’t leave it to one call and don’t leave it in the hands of somebody else. Don’t do that.\n“I felt like the throw-and-catch there to Jeremiah at the end was like, okay, we’re leaving no doubt with this thing.\n“To answer your question about the other part of it, I don’t know. I just know that Ohio State is a special place. It’s an honor to be here, an honor to be around some of those names that you just said, because when you hear some of those names like that, they’re some of the best coaches in the history of the game.\n“But the only way you do that is with great players and great people, and obviously this is a great place.”\n6. Was there any doubt who the ball was going to on third and 11? From College Sports on Sirius XM\nCollege Sports on Sirius XM asked this to Ryan Day and Jeremiah Smith after the game…\nRyan Day: “No.”\nJeremiah Smith: “No.”\nSmith: “I love coach Day to death. I’d do anything for him. Just happy to be on his team and being a Buckeye.”\nSenior receiver Emeka Egbuka added in the postgame locker room scene: “”The only thing that’s freshman about Jeremiah is his age.”\nIn his postgame press conference, Day was asked about why the Buckeyes decided to call that deep shot to Smith with the game on the line…\n“We felt like we had an advantage with Jeremiah on that shot, and we talked about it all week. We really hadn’t thrown one all game, and it was like, you know what, game on the line, let’s just go. Let’s go aggressive.\nGet the On3 Top 10 to your inbox every morning\nBy clicking \"Subscribe to Newsletter\", I agree to On3's Privacy Notice, Terms, and use of my personal information described therein.\n“I just thought to myself, only one National Championship, you only get one opportunity a year to do this, let’s just lay it on the line and put it out there and be aggressive. And that’s what we did.\n“I talked to the defensive guys and I talked to the offensive guys that we were going to continue to be aggressive throughout the game. I told the team that leading up to the game. And I had to make sure I followed through that.”\nBoy, did they. The deep ball now known as “third and Jeremiah” will live in Ohio State lore.\n5. Ryan Day reflects on the change from regular season loss to postseason dominance\n“I wouldn’t say that it was a reset. It wasn’t like at the end of the year we were broken. It wasn’t that way. We had an awful day. I don’t know how else to describe it. We had an awful day, and we just said we could never do that again.\n“And I think it’s the job of the head coach to take the responsibility when something goes bad like that, but then on days like this, make sure that everyone understands it’s the warriors and guys on the field that deserve all the credit, not the coach. The coach gets too much attention sometimes. I want to make sure these guys are the ones getting the attention.”\n4. Carson Hinzman gives hilarious quote to Lettermen Row while puffing cigar\nHinzman replaced an injured Seth McLaughlin in November after starting 12 games as an undersized center in 2023. Now he’s the national title-winning center who replaced the Rimington Trophy-winning center. What a remarkable story for Hinzman, who will be one of the unquestioned leaders of the offensive line next year.\nThe Wisconsin native who grew up on a dairy farm reflected on his journey.\n“The resilience that God has bestowed in me is unquestionable. I think coming from my family and where I’ve been from, and what these guys have done for me, Coach Mick and what the coaches have done, I think I’ve been more than ready to take over the lead. I’m not Seth. I’m nowhere near trying to fill his shoes, but I’m trying to be me and do everything I can to try getting better every day. …\n“Wisconsin cream rises to the top, and that’s what happened here.”\n3. Josh Fryar, Donovan Jackson tell Kings of the North their postgame plans\nThe best quote from the entire postgame celebration came from friends of Lettermen Row, Kings of the North. While Bill Landis was live on the field after the game, he asked Josh Fryar and Donovan Jackson about their postgame plans.\nThe responses from both were epic.\nFryar: “I’m getting hammered.”\nJackson: “I will be right there with him getting hammered. I am 22 years old, and I can legally do it.”\n2. Jack Sawyer answers what it means to know Ryan Day is a national title-winning coach\nLettermen Row then asked the senior leader, star defensive end, Central Ohio native and avid Ryan Day defender what he thinks knowing Day is a national champion:\n“Damn right he is. He’s the best coach in college football. And he’s going to win a couple more of these things here soon.”\n1. Ryan Day speaks about his national title-winning roster\n“I think this playoff system allowed our team to grow and learn and build. You can say whatever you want about people talked a lot about how much money guys were making in NIL and different things like that. That was just because NIL was available. The majority of our team came back. These guys have been here for a long time.\n“Certainly Will was a huge addition, Caleb was a huge addition, don’t get me wrong. But when you hear that number, that doesn’t mean a whole lot other than the fact that the market value for our guys in Columbus at Ohio State is pretty high. That’s what it means. When that got tagged on us early, there was a lot of pressure put on our players.\n“But that’s nothing new at Ohio State. I think the difference is that we finished the season the right way, and we grew. We built, and we responded to tough times. Man, isn’t that what life is all about.\n“These guys learned a bunch of life lessons, but they’re going to go down in Ohio State history as one of the greatest teams to ever play at Ohio State. After all the things that have been said throughout the year, these guys are going to be cemented as one of the best stories in Ohio State history and one of the best football teams ever. Only nine teams have ever done it, and three in over 50 years. These guys right here. There was a point where not a lot of people had that vision, but these guys did, and they saw it through.\n“Ohio State may not be for everybody, but it’s for these guys, and I’m really proud of them.”\nBonus 1: Ryan Day embraces family\nCredit 10TV’s Adam King and his videographer for capturing this moment that absolutely cannot be left off the list.\nRyan’s wife Nina: “Oh my God, you did it!”\nRyan Day, hugging Nina and his family: “We did it. We did it. We did it.”\nDay’s son, RJ: “We’re so proud of you, dad.”",

On Jan. 10, at the advice of roadside assistance from AAA, he called Richmond 911 to see if officers could respond and put out flare flights.\nBut he said no one answered.\n“It went to a recording. It said, ‘stay on the line, all operators are busy,’ and I stayed on the phone for 10 minutes. No one ever came to the line,\" Nelson recalled.\nHe then hung up the phone and called Virginia State Police, but before the agency was able to get an officer on the scene, a tow truck had arrived to bring him to safety.\n“It was a real disappointing, disappointing evening that that happened, and like I said, we could have been killed,\" Nelson said. \"I just hate to think of a situation if someone had been having a heart attack or accident, where you really needed that medical attention immediately to save your life, and you dial 911 and this is what you get.”\nTaylor Fuqua, a spokesperson for Richmond's Department of Emergency Communications (DEC), said DEC received 19 911 calls during the timeframe of Nelson's call, and several of them were for \"serious incidents.\"\nFor seven of those calls, Fuqua said it took more than two minutes for an operator to answer.\nNelson's experience is not unique. City Councilmember Sarah Abubaker shared with CBS 6 a recording of an automated message that she said one of her constituents received after calling 911.\nThe message said in part, “ You have reached the Richmond 911 Emergency Call Center. You have not been placed on hold or sent to voicemail. We are experiencing a high volume of emergency calls at this time.”\nAbubker played that same recording at a public safety committee meeting in March after DEC Director Stephen Willoughby claimed that callers \"never\" get sent to voicemail — a remark that Abubaker dismissed as \"semantics.\"\n“They say it’s not voicemail, but it’s an automated response and they’re still being putting on hold. You can call a rose by any other name. It is voicemail,\" she said.\nDuring that meeting, Ryan Clarke, who said he works at Richmond 911 and is a member of a union, said operators are stretched thin right now, partly due to a change that took effect in July of last year that required DEC to take control over medical calls — something that used to be handled by the Richmond Ambulance Authority (RAA).\nClarke called it a \"huge change\" that staff were not properly trained for.\n“Our members, they feel overwhelmed, they feel unprepared, they feel stressed out going to work. That’s all kind of leading to a level of service that’s impacting the citizens of the city, and it’s not as good as we could be,\" Clarke said. \"This change has added to an already overwhelmed workload for 911 call takers who already face understaffing and increased responsibilities.\"\nBefore July 2024, DEC would transfer medical emergency calls, such as reports of heart attacks and cardiac arrests, to RAA so that its staff could triage the calls and determine what types of response and services were appropriate. But not even a year after the change was implemented, RAA wants to take that responsibility back.\nRAA CEO Chip Decker told councilmembers that the authority's personnel have the more appropriate medical background to properly assess and prioritize medical emergency calls. He said errors in categorizing these kinds of calls have only increased under DEC's management, which in turn impacts RAA's response times.\nBetween July and December 2023, Decker said there were 85 reported \"upgrades,\" which meant first responders arrived on scene of an emergency to find the patient's condition was more serious than initially categorized. Between July and December 2024, after DEC began fielding medical calls, RAA reported 209 \"upgrades.\"\n\"I need DEC to get it right. They have to answer the phone, they have to pick the right event type, then they have to follow it down to the right determinant,\" Decker said.\nMeanwhile, DEC argued that the switch helped save time by eliminating the step of transferring medical calls to another agency. DEC officials said there's been a one-minute reduction in how long it takes to code a call, meaning pre-arrival instructions have been able to begin sooner for people in crisis. Eliminating transfers also reduced the risks of calls being dropped, they said.\nAdditionally, by centralizing resources, DEC Deputy Director Jackie Crotts said citizens no longer have to talk to multiple communications officer which will \"reduce frustration\" for callers.\n\"EMTs and paramedics taking 911 calls is an antiquated way of doing business and delivering service. For instance, police officers and firefighters haven't answered 911 calls or emergency calls in the City of Richmond in 30 years,\" Willoughby said.\nWhen Abubaker asked for data about how many callers receive the automated message and how many calls have been categorized incorrectly, Willoughby did not have that information.\nFuqua told CBS 6 that the average percentage of callers who hang up before an operator can answer is 6% so far this year. It was 13.5% in all of 2024.\nCouncilmembers said they're requesting more data before making a decision on how to move forward regarding the management of medical emergency calls. Following the public safety meeting, Stephanie Lynch said she was left with a \"question mark\" as to whether the city made the right move back in July.\nIn a statement to CBS 6, Abubaker said, \"For years, RAA played a central role in answering medical 911 calls — a system that, by many accounts, worked well. It's unclear why we would move away from something that was reliably serving the public... If returning to the previous model results in faster, more accurate responses and better patient care, then that's the direction we should move in. This isn't about turf -- it's about getting results for the people we serve.\"\nCBS 6 is committed to sharing community voices on this important topic.

    "text": "MERKEL, Tx — According to Merkel residents the roads are a hassle to travel, on even the sunniest day. But when it rains it pours, and the Merkel roads can’t handle the overflow. Anna Maria Salinas says potholes and flooding is a huge issue in Merkel. “We have problems when it rains,” Salinas said. “We ask if we can have gravel and dirt. Sometimes they come and they put some down. But when it rains there is always a hole. It’s everywhere you go, and I wish they would fix the roads.” According to Salinas the water rises extremely fast on Yucca St., but in her opinion the worst flooding occurs where the children play. “It always gets so bad,” Salinas said. Mainly up by the schools.” The three-year Merkel resident only wants what’s best for Merkel, and its residents. “I wish they would fix them so we can have good roads where they won’t be so bumpy,” Salinas said. “I know the elderly likes to go walking and there is always holes everywhere. They get hurt. That’s what I would like, for the residents in this little town to have a safe place to walk.” Merkel’s city manager Brian Weaver says Merkel is working on a budget to repair the roads. The city manager said addressing the flooding problem is going to be a more difficult problem to solve but they are searching for funds to find a solution.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help. Pedaling kindness: Massachusetts Peloton group leaves servers $7,200 tip 'Feed somebody you don’t know': Philadelphia man inspires, heals through food Why strangers raised $450,000 to help a dependable Burger King worker buy his first home Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "« Un sentiment d’impunité total » : Depardieu, Abril… Lucie Lucas dénonce le comportement de certains acteurs",
    "text": "« Ãƒâ€¡a fait 15 ans que je suis comÃƒÂ©dienne et que je protÃƒÂ¨ge une bonne partie de ces boomers dÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©s en ne disant pas en interview tout le mal quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ils font aux autres sur un plateau de tournage Ã‚Â», a affirmÃƒÂ© Lucie Lucas dans un commentaire sur Instagram. LP/Fred Dugit\nSa réaction à l’affaire Gérard Depardieu avait fait beaucoup parler, Lucie Lucas a décidé de sortir du silence. Jeudi, l’actrice s’est exprimée au micro de franceinfo au sujet de la tribune signée par une cinquantaine d’artistes en soutien à l’acteur, mis en examen pour viols et accusé par de nombreuses femmes d’agressions sexuelles. Elle est également revenue sur ses écrits visant l’actrice Victoria Abril, signataire du texte, avec qui elle a beaucoup tourné.\nTout commence mardi sur Instagram. La comédienne Charlotte Arnould, l’une des accusatrices de Gérard Depardieu, publie sur le réseau social la liste des signataires de la tribune en soutien à l’acteur. Dans les commentaires, Lucie Lucas s’emporte.\n« Tu veux qu’on parle de tes nombreuses agressions y compris sexuelles envers tes partenaires ? » «Ã‚Â Ãƒâ€¡a fait 15 ans que je suis comÃƒÂ©dienne et que je protÃƒÂ¨ge une bonne partie de ces boomers dÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©s en ne disant pas en interview tout le mal quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ils font aux autres sur un plateau de tournage (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦) JÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ai beaucoup ÃƒÂ dire sur certaines personnes de cette liste dÃƒÂ©licieuse de cosignatairesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», ÃƒÂ©crit-elle. Avant de sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢en prendre directement ÃƒÂ Victoria Abril, qui joue le rÃƒÂ´le de sa mÃƒÂ¨re dans la sÃƒÂ©rie ClemÂ : Â«Â Tu veux quâ€™on parle de tes nombreuses agressions y compris sexuelles envers tes partenairesÂ ? Ã€ y rÃ©flÃ©chir, je ne suis pas surprise que tu aies signÃ© ce torchonâ€¦ Tu flippes toi aussi et Ã y rÃ©flÃ©chir tu as bien raisonÂ Â».\nJeudi, au micro de Franceinfo, Lucie Lucas a précisé ses déclarations sur sa consœur. « Les violences sexuelles dont je l’accuse n’ont pas été tournées contre moi, mais ce sont des choses dont j’ai été témoin, explique l’actrice. Ce n’est pas Victoria Abril que j’ai envie d’accuser. J’ai eu cette espèce de montée de sang. Je me suis peut-être permis ça, car c’est ma maman du cinéma et je me suis sentie profondément trahie et abandonnée ».\n« Tyranniser des plateaux entiers » Plus qu’un acteur ou une actrice en particulier, Lucie Lucas cible une génération de comédiens. « Ce que je voudrais dénoncer, c’est qu’il y a une impunité, un sentiment d’impunité qui est total chez certaines personnes et notamment chez certaines personnes des générations de Gérard Depardieu et Victoria Abril, qui se permettent de tyranniser des plateaux entiers et d’avoir des comportements que je ne trouve pas admissibles voire qui ne sont pas légaux ».\nVictoria Abril n’a, pour le moment, pas commenté les déclarations de Lucie Lucas. Mais l’acteur Kevin Elarbi, qui a joué aux côtés des deux actrices dans la série Clem, a pris sa défense sur X (ex-Twitter) : « Victoria Abril est intègre, et a sa liberté d’expression. Qu’on soit d’accord ou non, elle a le droit de parole. Sans dictature fasciste de la censure. Je le lui ai dit hier, qu’elle soit assurée de mon soutien inconditionnel. Travailler avec elle sur Clem fut un honneur ».",

    "title": "Granada floor waitresses are planted against the employer for their labor rights: \"Without us there is no hotel\"",
    "text": "Granada floor waitresses have said enough. His reality is drawn exhausting as his stories are known, such as Belén Castañeda. At 54, he is 17 as a flat waitress in hotels in the city of the Alhambra. His body no longer endures the rhythm, being in charge of two children and a dependent husband in a high degree, but stands. “I have osteoarthritis, lumbar problems, shattered dolls and yet I have to continue working because there is no other option,” he explains.\nThe cry of the ‘kellys’ and summer waitresses through literature: “Any resistance exercise”\nDuring his career he has seen how working conditions have worsened: outsourcing of services, more rooms per day -calling 2 euros per room -less salary and less rights. “Before we had eight hours to do our homework, now we have to clean rooms in less than 20 minutes. And if the client leaves the room at 12, at 12:30 there is already another waiting,” says this worker.\nDay after day, Bethlehem and many others are forced to assume “strenuous” working conditions, which go through eternal days, low wages and injuries that are not always enough to be low or, worse, that can be withdrawn because some are disabling. Tired of the disdain with which they are treated from the hotels in which they work cleaning and fixing the rooms and stays, they have been planted before the employer to claim measures that reverse their situation. They will do it first from Granada, but they aspire to make their wick pledge throughout Spain.\nWhile the employer defends that the situation “is not so serious”, the Government opens to assess that certain professions, among which the floor waitresses would be, can retire before they turn 67 without being penalized. To achieve their objectives and gathered in the Assembly, they have launched a manifesto in which they denounce the conditions of exploitation in the sector: low wages, precarious contracts, abusive work rhythms and physical wear that leaves them with sequelae before reaching the retirement age.\nCentral manifestation in Granada\nHe knows well what he’s talking about, since Belén has gone through several hotels and in all he has found the same pattern: “They see us as invisible. In hotels, the face is given and the waiters, but without us, there is no hotel.” Despite the difficulties, he has always fought against precariousness, denouncing hidden before the Labor Inspection, which has made him suffer reprisals. “If you complain, they put you in the blacklist. But you have to report because this work is killing us.”\nThey demand, among other measures, early retirement without penalty in the pensions they receive for withdrawing before stipulated by law, compliance with the hospitality agreement, the end of outsourcing and guarantee that their rest days are respected. They point out that while hotels increase their benefits, they continue to suffer unassumable workloads that seriously affect their health.\nTo make visible their fight, they have joined in the Trade Union Coordination of Workers of Andalusia (CSTA) And they have summoned mobilizations, with a central demonstration in Granada on May 31, in addition to previous concentrations in different parts of the province. “They are squeezing us and, if we don’t go out, nobody listens to us,” they say. The next April 10 will be planted before the headquarters of the hospitality employer of Granada to warn them that this will be the first of many actions that will not stop until their reality improves.\nExhausted and exhausted\nToñi Milla also has 54 years and three decades of experience in the sector. Every morning, before leaving home, you must take a drug cocktail to relieve the pain of your hands, affected by the breakage of the carpal tunnel in both and osteoarthritis. “I get up with my hands asleep, fans. I find it hard to start, but you have to continue,” he says. In their experience, few reach the retirement age without having passed before disabling diseases. “Only 5% of the waiters of floor in Spain arrive at 65. We retire before, but because of illness,” he denounces.\nWorking conditions have changed dramatically since it started working. “Before we were hired by the hotel, now everything is managed by external companies. We have lowered the hours of contract and have uploaded the number of rooms,” he explains. Today, some workers have to clean up to 16 or 17 rooms in a four -hour day, which forces them to stay longer without being paid for it. “They are squeezing us. And if we protect, they tell us that we are not going to get anything. Well, staying at home we do not get anything,” he says.\nPrecariousness is not just the veteran thing. Valentina Álvarez is 27 years old and already drags chronic back pain. He has been working in hotels for almost a decade and has seen how the trend is to hire young women, many of them migrants, hoping that they will end up without complaining. “I thought it was strong, but I’ve been at this hotel only and I already have back pain that doesn’t take me away,” he says. In their company, workers clean the bathrooms One of her companions is low because, literally, she could not stand up after a working day.\nIn recent years, he has seen dozens of companions through the hotel. “They hire young women or with family charges because they know they are not going to complain. We change the shifts without prior notice, they raise the workload and if we protect, they tell us that we are young and that we should not complain.” For her, the fight is essential: “If we don’t fight, nothing will change. They treat us as if we were machines, but we are people. Nobody can endure this rhythm up to 67 years.”\nThe employer denies precariousness\nFrom the Federation of Hospitality of Granada, its general secretary, Juanma López, denies that the situation is so serious. “It is not good to generalize,” he says. Defends that “companies scrupulously comply with the collective agreement” and that “the workload is reasonable.” It also argues that “the business benefit should not be correlated with the discomfort of workers” because “wages and conditions are regulated by collective bargaining.”\nLópez insists that all hospitality cannot be responsible for the bad practices of some companies since there are hotels where the conditions are good. However, it acknowledges that there are establishments where the outsourcing precarizes the conditions, although it defends that, in any case, the hospitality agreement must be fulfilled. It also values ​​the effort of the employer in the last agreement for matching the conditions of the floor waitresses with those of other workers in the sector, such as receptionists and room waiters.\nDespite this, the workers do not see significant improvements in their day to day. The difference between what the employers’ and the reality of floor waitresses says is evident: while some talk about compliance with the agreement, others tell how work rhythms are destroying them. The struggle for early retirement without penalty in pensions is only part of a major problem: to be able to work without its health deteriorating irreversibly. “It is impossible to reach 67 years in this work. We do not arrive. And those who do it, are broken,” says Toñi Milla.\nThe Government values ​​early retirements\nHowever, for some time, the central government values ​​the possibility that floor waitresses can retire in advance without suffering penalties in their pensions. “Our own patterns recognize us that they prefer it because we cost them money being low and if we are usually injured, they have to hire more people,” Valentina explains. However, he emphasizes that they would suffer so many casualties “if they gave good conditions.”\nRafaela and Mar have the “broken body” of cleaning and will fight to be recognized: “We live with pain”\nFrom the Ministries of Social Security and Labor this issue has been addressed, although without concrete advances. In the first one a negotiating table with the unions is kept open to assess this possibility and in the case of the second, its headline, Yolanda Díaz, assumes that the penalties must be “corrected” in certain professions in which “You can’t do more” When an advanced age is reached.\nThrough our Instagram account we move what happens in Andalusia and Seville beyond words: we inform you of the latest news and we offer you extra content so that you know reality in detail.\nGo to our community in This link .\n#Granada #floor #waitresses #planted #employer #labor #rights #hotel",
