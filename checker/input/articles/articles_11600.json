    "title": "China's Xi says ties with Russia became stronger in 2023",
    "text": "BEIJING, China - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday said the foundation of Sino-Russian ties had grown stronger in 2023, as he exchanged New Year greetings with his counterpart Vladimir Putin, state media reported. Beijing and Moscow are staunch allies and have strengthened their relationship even as Western countries have turned their backs on Russia over its military invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Both sides have also made much of the personal relationship between the two leaders, and Xi has referred to Putin as his \"good friend\". Xi said that \"the material and public opinion foundation of our relationship has become stronger\" in his recap of the year to Putin on Sunday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. \"In the face of changes unseen in a century and a turbulent regional and international situation, China-Russia relations have maintained healthy and stable development and moved steadily in the right direction,\" Xi said. \"Under our joint leadership, political mutual trust between the two sides has further deepened, strategic coordination has drawn closer, and mutually beneficial cooperation has continued to achieve new results,\" the Chinese leader was quoted as saying. Xi noted that the volume of bilateral trade exceeded $200 billion ahead of schedule, and said Beijing was looking forward to marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties in 2024. During a visit to Beijing by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin this month, Xi said maintaining close ties with Moscow was a \"strategic choice.\"",

When it is under threat, and you've actually got to call it out, and you've got to stand up and make your contribution,\" Luxon told media after two days of meetings at the NATO summit in Washington.\nWhile not a member of the NATO alliance, New Zealand is part of a group of countries referred to as the Indo-Pacific Four(IP-4), which also includes Japan, South Korea and Australia.\nThe IP-4 held sessions with NATO and EU leaders, while Luxon had bilateral meetings with a number of leaders including from Canada, France and Spain.\nLuxon said in a statement after he chaired the IP-4 meeting that it made sense for four of the most advanced democracies in the region to work together to support international stability.\nNew Zealand is \"making sure that we are going to be a trusted good partner to them to our friends and allies,\" Luxon later told reporters.\nNew Zealand on Friday announced it would extend its contribution to the U.S.-led coalitions operating in the Red Sea.\nLuxon also warned a situation like Russia's invasion of Ukraine had the potential to occur in East Asia.\n\"When you think about the situations we have with North Korea firing missiles over Korean and Japanese airspace, when you think about the challenges in the Second Thomas Shoal reef with respect to the Philippines, and the behavior that we saw from China there, when you think about Taiwan, you know, we have potential flashpoints in our region,\" Luxon said.\nNew Zealand this week announced a further NZ$16 million ($9.74 million) in support for Ukraine and further sanctions against seven individuals and 12 entities providing military assistance to Russia.",
