    "title": "Edtech: The Digital Revolution Transforming Education",
    "text": "In recent years, financial technology, or Fintech, has reshaped how we bank, pay bills, and manage money.\nBut while Fintech has dominated headlines, another tech-driven revolution is quietly transforming a sector just as vital: education.\nEnter Edtech—education technology—a powerful force redefining how we teach, learn, and manage education systems.\nAt its core, Edtech is the integration of technology into education to enhance learning experiences, streamline teaching methods, and improve administrative efficiency. It’s not just about online classes or e-learning platforms, though those are part of it. Edtech encompasses a wide range of tools and systems designed to make education more accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone involved—students, teachers, and institutions alike.\nImagine a science teacher in a remote village in Ghana struggling to explain the complexities of the human heart using only a chalkboard. Now, picture that same teacher using an interactive 3D model on a tablet or a virtual reality (VR) headset that allows students to explore the heart in real-time. Suddenly, a challenging concept becomes vivid, interactive, and unforgettable. This is the magic of Edtech—it bridges gaps, sparks curiosity, and makes learning more dynamic.\nFor students, Edtech opens up a world of possibilities. It enables personalized learning, where lessons adapt to individual paces and preferences. Gamified apps like Duolingo turn language learning into a fun, point-based challenge, while platforms like Coursera and Udemy offer access to courses from top institutions worldwide. For teachers, Edtech provides tools to create more engaging lessons, track student progress, and even automate administrative tasks. Schools and institutions benefit from systems that manage everything from online exams to student records, making education more efficient and scalable.\nEdtech comes in many forms. Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Google Classroom and Moodle help teachers organize lessons and assignments. Virtual and augmented reality tools allow students to take virtual field trips or conduct experiments in immersive environments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms, such as Squirrel AI, tailor lessons to each student’s learning style and pace. These innovations are not just futuristic concepts—they’re already being used in classrooms around the world.\nIt’s important to note that Edtech and e-learning are not the same. While e-learning refers specifically to online education—think remote classes or digital courses—Edtech is the broader ecosystem that supports and enhances education through technology. E-learning is just one piece of the Edtech puzzle, which also includes tools for classroom management, data analysis, and even school administration.\nFor Ghana, embracing Edtech is not just an option—it’s a necessity. With a young, tech-savvy population and increasing access to digital tools, the country is well-positioned to leverage Edtech for educational growth. From improving literacy rates to equipping students with 21st-century skills, the potential is immense. But realizing this potential requires investment in infrastructure, teacher training, and innovative solutions tailored to local needs.\nThe rise of Ghanaian Edtech startups is a promising sign. These homegrown innovators are creating solutions that address unique challenges, from improving access to quality education in rural areas to developing culturally relevant content. Their work is a testament to the transformative power of Edtech and its potential to shape the future of education in Ghana.\nAs we stand on the brink of this digital education revolution, one question remains: Are we ready to fully embrace the possibilities of Edtech? The answer will determine not just the future of learning but also the future of Ghana’s workforce and economy. The journey has just begun, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Stay tuned as we explore how Ghana’s Edtech pioneers are leading the charge in the next installment of this series. The future of education is here—and it’s digital.",

    "text": "[annual 30 Under 30 North America](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2025/)list. More than 600 recipients were spread across 20 categories.\nAccording to\n[Forbes](/music/dallas-singer-erykah-badu-named-best-randb-artist-of-all-time-by-forbes-19899580), the combined social media following of all the recipients in the class of 2025 tops 300 million across all platforms, and they raised more than $3.6 billion in funding.\nCategories included Art & Style, Consumer Technology, Education, Energy, Enterprise Technology, Finance, Food & Drink, Games, Healthcare, Hollywood & Entertainment, Manufacturing & Industry, Marketing & Advertising, Media, Music, Retail & E-commerce, Science, Social Impact, Social Media, Sports and Transportation.\nMost of the honorees are based in California or New York, but there were 32 Texans, six of whom currently reside or originate from North Texas.\nSports\nDallas resident Rawleigh Williams III, 28, [received recognition](https://www.forbes.com/profile/rawleigh-williams/?list=30under30-sports/)for his involvement in creating a sports division within Milk & Honey, a music agency.\n“Being named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list is truly an honor and a humbling moment in my journey,” Williams III said. “When my football career ended, it was a challenging time, but it pushed me to find a new purpose in helping athletes navigate their careers off the field.”\nWilliams says he is grateful for mentors, colleagues and family members who have supported him along the way. He also says it was his goal since joining Milk & Honey in 2021 to build a sports division serving clients with the “same intensity and dedication” he brought to his career before opening the sports arm.\nEducation\nDallasite Carlynn Greene, 25, was recognized for her YouTube videos and her Scholarship Guru business, both of which offer learning resources, free training sessions and advice on navigating scholarships for higher education.“To think that I started my work all the way back in 2017 and was making only about $1,000 per year — despite helping people win millions of dollars in scholarships and graduate debt-free across the globe — to now seven years later being named as one of many for this prestigious list,” Greene said on a LinkedIn post.\nGreene said in the post that at one time she had contemplated quitting this work because she was unable to make a full-time income, but she stayed true to herself and her goal of educating others. She does so through Edfluntial, a new Scholarship Guru initiative partnering with businesses, nonprofits and creators to amplify social impact while ensuring financial sustainability.\nHollywood & Entertainment\nMcKinney resident Mason Thames, 17, was recognized for achievements in the acting world. Thames is the youngest person across all categories to be honored in the class of 2025.Thames took to Instagram to thank Forbes\n[in a story](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18074578849612848/?hl=en)that he has since kept as a highlight feature.\nGames\nShane Gill, 28, and Riley Testut, 29, [both based in Dallas](https://www.forbes.com/profile/altstore/?list=30under30-games/), were recognized for their work on AltStore, an alternative app distribution platform allowing users to sideload apps onto iOS devices without going through the App Store.\n“Honored to follow in the footsteps of incredible role models like Elizabeth Holmes and SBF [Sam Bankman-Fried]!!”\n[Testut wrote on a Threads post,](https://www.threads.net/@oradecima/post/DDJ-mSJoeGv)poking a bit of fun at past honorees who haven't exactly made the most of their years since being named to the list.\nAlso in the games category, Fort Worth resident Christopher Earl, 26, a Marine Corps veteran, was called out for founding Regiment Gaming. The organization aims to combat suicide by uniting veterans and active military members to play video games.\n“While it may show my name on there, I was not able to do this alone,” Earl wrote on a LinkedIn post. “I owe a huge thank you to the entirety of my staff, both past and present. Their hard work, creativity and dedication has been the backbone of Regiment's success.”",

    "title": "Tuco Marine: Words from the CEO 2023",
    "text": "As we approach the end of 2023, I would like to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and share some reflections on our journey together in 2023. This year not only marks the conclusion of 2023 but also commemorates our 25th anniversary. It has been an incredible journey, and we are immensely proud to have reached this milestone with the support of our dedicated team.\nTo celebrate this significant occasion, we recently held a grand jubilee celebration, honoring the dedication and hard work of our exceptional employees. This festive event brought us all together in the spirit of gratitude and camaraderie, reaffirming our commitment to excellence and innovation in the maritime industry.\nI want to thank clients, employees, suppliers and partners, for your unwavering support throughout the year. Your trust in Tuco Marine Group is the driving force behind our success, and we are truly honored to have you as part of our extended family.\nThe geopolitical landscape has presented us with various hurdles, from the ongoing situation in Ukraine to rising energy concerns, high interest rates, and escalating health challenges. Despite these external challenges, we have continued to persevere and thrive in the face of adversity.\nArtemis Technologies Pioneer\nA year of technology Focus\n2023 has been marked by our unwavering focus on technology. Our collaboration with Artemis Technologies and their groundbreaking eFoiler technology has led to the launch of the world’s first high-speed, 100% electric foil-assisted commercial workboats based on our proven ProZero workboat platform. These vessels are designed and built to the highest commercial standards, delivering industry-leading electric propulsion, superior maneuverability, and energy efficiency, even in the harshest environments. In 2023, we were thrilled to introduce a 12-passenger version with a full-beam cabin, expanding our offerings to cater to a wider range of needs.\nUnmanned Surface Vessels\nThe year has also witnessed a significant acceleration in our production of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Our ProZero USVs have garnered attention from major players in the USV industry, showcasing their capabilities in data collection.\nOur Enduruns 8m USV, equipped with hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology and advanced launch and recovery equipment, has undergone successful testing in Klaipeda and Venedi as part of the Enduruns project, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 program.\nFurthermore, our 8m Met-Ocean Methodology USV has proven its capacity for genuine offshore data collection in some of the most challenging areas of the North Sea. And have been showcased for such by our esteemed clients.\nWe’re also proud to announce the launch and recognition of our 10m USV platform by Bureau Veritas, offering even greater payload capacity and extended range compared to our 8m versions.\nIn the defense sector, the demand for unmanned technology continues to grow, and our ProZero USV series is finding new applications and opportunities.\nFuel cell technology\nAs we focus on finding alternative power solutions for the maritime industry, fuel cell technology stands out as a promising candidate. Our collaboration with Blue World Technologies in the Blue Dolphin project, where we install and test a methanol fuel cell in our 11m Torqeedo electric-powered ProZero workboat, is a significant step towards a more sustainable future.\nNew Markets\nExpanding into new markets has also been a priority in 2023, with a particular emphasis on cold climate areas. We have invested heavily in research and development to enhance the operational capabilities of our ProZero Workboats in cold climates. This effort has led to increased sales in the Arctic region, and we have introduced new products tailored to these demanding environments.\nIn conclusion, 2023 has been a year of growth, innovation, and collaboration. We have welcomed new partners, such as Jurgen Vater, representing ProZero in Sweden, and strengthened our international ProZero Workboat partner network. Collaborative partnerships and local content agreements worldwide continue to be a cornerstone of our ProZero strategy, maximizing local input into design development and technology transfer to our partners across the globe.\nAs we bid farewell to this remarkable year, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our loyal customers, dedicated employees, and valued partners. Your unwavering support has been the driving force behind our achievements, and we are excited to embark on the journey that lies ahead in the new year.\nSource: Tuco Marine Group\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

    "text": "CD Projekt Group is confident it can self-fund all 5 of its new video game projects, including a new Witcher trilogy. Following 2015's best-selling The Witcher 3, and 2020's record-breaking Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt has been able to consistently generated high sales revenues from its games. During Cyberpunk's controversial launch, the company sold 13 million copies and made $541 million in sales--almost 5x the budget of the game. Alongside a multi-faceted business model that includes a fully-fledged software distribution storefront, the sci-fi shooter's performance helped CD Projekt amass a significant asset pile to fund future games and growth. Cyberpunk 2077 has seen various price fluctuations and re-releases, including steep discounts post-launch, a game-of-the-year-style re-release for next-gen consoles, and the standalone launch of the Phantom Liberty expansion. The company also re-released The Witcher 3 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. This cyclical product slate is often used in the industry, and it's a key part of CD Projekt's business model. Armed with years of successful game sales across both retail and digital channels, CD Projekt management believes that there's plenty of funds for its large multi-year project slate. This plan includes video games and transmedia. In a recent interview with Polish newspaper [Parkiet](https://www-parkiet-com.translate.goog/technologie/art39620191-adam-kicinski-ceo-cd-projektu-jestesmy-znow-na-ringu-w-pelni-sil?_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&utm_source=pocket_reader), CD Projekt CEO Adam Kicinski talks about the firm's financial guardrails that help ensure long-term success and continued investment: \"There have been various difficult situations in the history of CD Projekt so far. We have drawn conclusions from them and have been operating on the principle of having large buffers for years. We feel safe with the cash we have. \"Our strategy is well calculated. We believe that we will implement it from start to finish using our own funds. We do not need to reach for additional sources of financing.\" The news comes shortly after Kicisnki said that CD Projekt has [no intention of being acquired by a larger company](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95178/cd-projekt-still-not-interested-in-being-acquired-we-value-our-independence/index.html). As per a [Q3 2023 results filing](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/consolidated-report-for-q3-2023/) made last month, the company currently has over $600 million in assets.",
