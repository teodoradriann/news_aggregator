    "text": "My husband Jeff and I were just getting by. We were eating a lot of fast food and we weren’t really thinking about whether it was good for us. We were gaining weight and feeling like we’d been beat, emotionally and physically. Then I was introduced to the Challenge and I told my husband, “We should do this.” I said, “Let’s start eating healthy food and exercising, and see how we feel.” He agreed, so we cut down on carbs and added plenty of protein-rich food and lots of veggies to our meals. It was like night and day. We started to feel so much better. We use several Microsteps throughout the day, like drinking water and paying attention to how food looks, smells, and tastes. Now, we can always tell when we’ve had something that isn’t good for us. It makes you feel sluggish and in a kind of a brain fog, so we make sure we eat good food. We make a great low carb lasagna with noodles made of cheese and eggs. And for dessert, we make delicious low carb, sugar-free peanut butter fudge. Jeff and I enjoy each other’s company — we’ve been together for 38 years. We go for long walks and we ride our bikes. Jeff encourages me to keep going. He says, “You can do it!” I love our bike rides because they help to clear my mind. We get great exercise, and it’s also time for us to learn about the other person’s day and to de-stress. It makes us both feel special. When it’s too cold to ride our bikes, we go to the gym together. I also sometimes do a 20 minute exercise routine on YouTube. I’ve found that it really makes a big difference taking the Challenge with my best friend — my husband. I’ve lost 20 pounds since January and I have much more energy at work. The girls at work are encouraging. They let me know I’m doing a good job with my weight loss journey, and I encourage them, too. Checking into the Thrive app helps me get through my hectic workday. My husband and I have a nighttime routine and wind down in the evening. At bedtime, we turn off the phones and we do one or two breathing exercises, which relaxes us and helps us sleep. We also love watching nature Resets. At work, I’m less stressed. I’m a certified pharmacy technician, and when I’m up front waiting on our customers and the pickup line gets hectic and long, I just breathe for a couple of seconds and think about something that makes me happy, like my family, sunsets, or sunrises. Then I move on to the next person in line and I don’t get upset with customers. If I feel overwhelmed I do a quick stretch routine. I’ve improved my focus by not getting upset. I say to myself: just breathe and relax. Connection Microsteps are motivating me to stay in touch with my loved ones. I’m bonding with two grown kids, David and Austin, and all my family. Austin lives in Denver, my mom and dad and brother are in Kansas City, and I’m in Decatur, so we FaceTime regularly. I have a 54-year-old brother, Rich, who’s mentally challenged. He lives in a group home in Richmond, Missouri, and we’re very close. He calls me on the phone early every morning and we talk over FaceTime. He enjoys talking to me and finding out how we’re all doing. For self-care, I like to keep things simple. I spend time reading and doing puzzles. I also enjoy getting my nails done and playing board games with my family. It’s all about relaxing and enjoying those little moments in life. I also enjoy giving back to the community. For example, I pick up garbage that people have thrown on the ground, whether it’s in a Walmart parking lot or on the street. The Challenge has made me a better person. And I’m going to continue. I’m more attentive to my coworkers and my family. I don’t sweat the small stuff. I tell everyone: start off doing little things and soon you’ll build up to making big changes that will over time improve your well-being. — Tina Roddy, Walmart Supercenter #1690, Decatur, IL; $5K Winner",

    "text": "“No tener déficit fiscal es el gran problema de todos los Estados”, destacó Elisa Carrió. En una entrevista con Nacho Girón en CNN, la dirigente de la Coalición Cívica analizo el ajuste económico que el gobierno libertario llevo a cabo en el primer semestre de gestión. “El tema es como. Si lo hacemos en que grado de desesperación por bajar a cero la inflación en octubre, que es imposible, me lleva a tomar otras medidas donde después puedo tener una devaluación y un choque de nuevo”, detalló la cofundadora de Cambiemos.\nSiguiendo con el tópico económico, la ex legisladora explicó: “Si vos licuas todo y no pagas a nadie, no vas a tener déficit en tu casa. Pero le dejaste pagar al panadero, le dejaste de pagar al carnicero y le dejaste de pagar al que te corta el pasto. Por supuesto, vas a tener superávit. Ahora, sos un ladrón”. Con este planteo, Carrió apuntó directamente a la gestión de la cartera de Economía del gobierno, conducido po r Luis Caputo.\nEl periodista indagó en su reportaje sobre By Lilitas, el emprendimiento de indumentaria femenina que Elisa Carrió desarrolló junto con su hija. “La crisis me pego mucho, 30 por ciento abajo o 40. Lo estamos viendo en la economía real. Hay que seguir, por eso hay que ampliar trabajos y ser muy solidario con los demás. El derrame de un montón de autónomos, hay un 20 por ciento de la población. Depende de la comida diaria de muchísima gente”, confesó la dirigente y concluyó: “Yo no veo de qué manera mejore los ingresos. Si no hay crecimiento, si el agro industrial no sale adelante y si no se dejan de jorobar con las retenciones lo que va ser fin de año”.\nUbicada en Exaltación de la Cruz, la empresa By Lilitas se distingue en el diseño de camisas, blusas, pantalones y zapatos para mujer. También accesorios, como carteras, aros, brazaletes, colgantes, anillos y collares. En la página, se detallan el estilo y confección de la ropa que es ideada por la líder de la Coalición Cívica y su hija. “Fiel a su estilo como dice siempre mi mamá, se anima a los colores vibrantes y a los estampados. Sin importar la talla. En By Lilitas su rol es el más importante, ella elige las telas y piensa los diseños de cada cápsula. Sin escatimar en tela, nuestros talles arrancan del 46 hasta talles especiales”, detallaron de la marca.\n“El motor inicial de la marca fue la pasión que tiene mi madre por la ropa y por las telas, desde pequeña ella ideaba y confeccionaba sus prendas. Luego con el tiempo el tema recurrente era no encontrar talles con diseño a su gusto, por ese motivo desde hace años que ella opta por diseñar sus conjuntos y los confecciona con modistas independientes”, destacó Victoria Benítez, primogénita de la exdiputada nacional, en el portal de Bylilitas.\npor R.N.\nGalería de imágenes",

    "text": "Ex-People's Deputy serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Kyiv is fueling an internal conflict without the help of Russians Former people's deputy of Ukraine Igor Lutsenko, who currently serves in the Armed Forces of the Republic (AFU), accused that no one in power wants to take responsibility for the law on mobilization. Thus, Kyiv is fueling a conflict within the country even without help from Russia, the Strana publication quotes the ex-people’s deputy in [Telegram](https://t.me/stranaua/137325)-channel. “A conflict is being created in society. The way the bill is being promoted, the way they are trying to make some changes to it – it seems to me an extremely malignant approach and one that can lead to serious internal problems,” Lutsenko said. The soldier considers the lack of communication between the authorities and the population a huge problem. “Now it is actually decided who, how and in what order is going to die for the Motherland. And it turns out that there are no people capable of taking responsibility (for the bill – approx. “Tapes.ru”) on yourself,” he said. [See also Permanent representative of the Crimea warned Britain against being drawn into the conflict in Ukraine](https://pledgetimes.com/permanent-representative-of-the-crimea-warned-britain-against-being-drawn-into-the-conflict-in-ukraine/) After the release of the mobilization bill, the document received a lot of criticism from deputies from Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s Servant of the People party, although they were advised not to comment on it and stick to the same line as the faction leader. Thus, the chairman of the Rada’s economic committee and party member Dmitry Natalukha said that if the law is adopted, a significant part of the population will cut off all ties with the state and the negative effect on the economy will be difficult to overestimate. The General Staff also refused to take responsibility for the proposed bill. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny denied Zelensky’s words about the need to mobilize 500 thousand Ukrainians, saying that the command did not make such a request. #Ukrainian #authorities #accused #inciting #internal #conflict #Russia",

    "title": "11 Christ-Honoring NFL Players To Watch This Football Season",
    "text": "Every fall, the kickoff of another church-programming year coincides with the new NFL season. Likewise, many pro football players profess deep Christian faith while using their God-given athletic talents.\nYes, football games might occasionally prevent some worshipers from coming to church on Sundays. But sports can also serve as a segue to conversations about glorifying Jesus in our careers and conversations.\nTo help spark discussions about Christian living, ChurchLeaders often profiles athletes who honor God. For the 2024 NFL kickoff, here’s a fresh lineup of faith-filled NFL players:\n11 NFL Players Who Give God Glory 1. Grant Stuard (Indianapolis Colts) For years, Grant Stuard lied about his home life, trying to hide the instability he and his younger siblings faced. Their mother was a sex worker and a drug addict, and their father had a lengthy arrest and prison record.\nBy age 20, Stuard decided he’d had enough. With both his football and academic performance slipping, the University of Houston student drove to a cliff, intending to jump off. What made him reconsider? He heard the far-off sound of laughter from a father-son fishing duo below.\nAt a church service months later, Stuard heard a word of prophecy that touched his heart. “For me, that was God showing me he existed,” said the athlete, now 25. “[God] was telling me he cared about me, like genuinely cared about me, something that was missing my whole life.”\nAfter that, Stuard got his life back on track—and helped his family do the same. He insisted that his mother stick with rehab and give him custody of his younger sister.\nIn the 2021 NFL Draft, Stuard was the final pick, known as Mr. Irrelevant. But that achievement was incredibly relevant and meaningful for Stuard, based on everything he’d already overcome.\nThe Indianapolis Colts special teams player, who’s heading into his fourth NFL season, is also a husband, new father, rapper, and philanthropist. His foundation raises money to fight poverty, hunger, and sex trafficking in his hometown of Houston.\nStuard is upfront about how God transformed his life. “I would like to thank Jesus Christ, the Lord of my life, for completely changing me and making me into the person I am today,” he posted in 2020. “I want to encourage anyone who does not have a relationship with Jesus to seek Him. You will not be disappointed.”\nLast December on the Sports Spectrum podcast , Stuard shared, “I spent a good amount of time walking and living my life without Jesus and without a purpose. So [when] I finally made a connection with him and surrendered my life over to him, life became life.”\n2. Brandin Cooks (Dallas Cowboys) Before landing in Dallas, veteran Brandin Cooks played with four other teams. But the 30-year-old wide receiver out of Oregon State believes frequent trades offer some advantages.\nThey’re “an opportunity to be able to go around and make my mark on different cities, different people, different locker rooms, still at the same time producing at a high level,” said Cooks. “I look at it as a great thing, in a sense. I’d rather that than get cut five, six times.”\nWhen Cooks played for the Rams, punter Johnny Hekker called him “a spiritual spark” whose faith was “no secret to anybody.”\nIn May, Cooks partnered with He Gets Us to hold a football camp for 700 kids in his hometown of Stockton, California. The wide receiver said the He Gets Us movement shares his passion for loving our neighbors.\n“Our neighbor is someone that may not look like us, talk like us, dress like us,” Cooks told Fox Sports Digital . “We were called to love, and God will take care of everything else. We’ve just gotta continue to be that example on how to love, even in the most uncomfortable moments.”\nWhen Cooks says faith in Christ is his foundation, that’s not just lip service: “I truly mean it when I say it. Everything I have, everything I’ve been blessed with, even from the good to the not so good. [Jesus has] always been my foundation growing up, and [I] just continue to be able to be a light in this world today.”\n3. Bo Nix (Denver Broncos) After a close quarterback competition during training camp, the Denver Broncos named rookie Bo Nix as their starter. Then on Sept. 4, they named him the first rookie team captain since 1967.\nAll summer, Nix’s new teammates and coaches described him as “mature.” Part of that could be his age, 24. Because of pandemic -related eligibility rules, Nix started 61 college games, the most ever for an NCAA quarterback. Plus, Nix is already married.\nBut the maturity also might stem from being grounded in faith . “God has ordered my steps,” Nix said in 2021, while transferring from Auburn to Oregon . “And [God] has a plan for me like he does for everyone else.”\nBack in high school, Nix was already talking publicly about his beliefs. On the Sports Spectrum podcast in 2018, the athlete said he wanted to help people know “it’s not weird or different to…do what’s right and be a Christ-follower.”\nAfter being drafted No. 12 overall in April, Nix referenced Isaiah 55:9 , saying he believes God’s plans are higher than our ways. He’s a “perfect example” of that, the QB added: “You can look at my story and know that [God] has an individual plan for each one of our lives. He sets it out in front of us, and all we have to do is follow.”\n4. DeAndre Hopkins (Tennessee Titans) For Tennessee Titans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins , faith and family define him as much as football does. The South Carolina native, who was baptized in 2012 while playing at Clemson, calls his relationship with God a “major part of my life.”\nThat faith has helped Hopkins, 32, persevere amid tragedy. When he was just 5 months old, his father was killed in a car accident. Then in 2002, his mother, Sabrina Greenlee , was blinded by an acid attack.\nAfter every touchdown Hopkins scores, he gives his mom the ball. He also wrote the foreword to her new memoir, “ Grant Me Vision: A Journey of Family, Faith, and Forgiveness .” In the book, Greenlee describes how hardships have built character.\nCongratulating his mom on her book launch, Hopkins posted, “From selling drugs just to feed four kids , to overcoming depression from being blind. This is more than a book, it’s Us.”\nDespite the family’s struggles, “my mom made sure I knew about God,” Hopkins said. “She raised us in tough times, held down two jobs, and I watched her faith grow stronger and stronger.”\n5. Adoreé Jackson (New York Giants) Another NFL player influenced by his mother’s strong Christian faith is Adoreé Jackson . The 28-year-old New York Giants cornerback said the selflessness of his mom, Vianca Jackson , qualifies her as a true hero. While her son was attending the University of Southern California, she kept her breast cancer diagnosis from him so it wouldn’t be a burden or distraction.\n“I didn’t want his grades to drop; I didn’t want him to get hurt in any sport,” Vianca said in 2017, after beating cancer. “I wanted [Adoreé] to keep his mind clear and keep his focus on Jesus. I knew I was going to be okay.”\nJackson said of his mom , “She taught me to cherish what I have. Seeing her faith in God and her belief showed me that if I keep those things as well, things will work out for me.” Jackson also thanked God for “never letting my faith waver, never letting me stray.” Quoting Proverbs 22:6 , he said his parents raised him up in the way he should go.\nThat’s crucial in a sport played mostly on Sundays. “You don’t get to go to as much church as back in the day when you were kids,” the athlete said. “But I understand the teachings that [my parents] told me, that the Bible taught me, or school has taught me, or church.”\nBefore being selected in the first round of the 2017 draft, Jackson posted, “I have faith that God is living out a divine plan through me. Have faith in God. – Mark 11:22 .”\n6. Ben Stille (Arizona Cardinals) At 26, defensive lineman Ben Stille has already played for three NFL teams. The journeyman out of Nebraska has experienced the pressures—and frequent moves—of trying to succeed as a pro.\nNow with Arizona, Stille has shifted back and forth from the Cardinals’ active roster to the practice squad. But no matter where he lands, he’s determined to make the most of his gifts, knowing they come from God.\nThat attitude “stems from my faith in Jesus Christ,” Stille said on the “ Pro Mindset ” podcast. “In my mind, just playing for him and really his judgment is the only one that matters to me.”\nIt’s been “a huge step…to figure out that my faith isn’t something that’s just lived out in church. It’s lived out in my day-to-day life,” the athlete added. “And ultimately, God has called me to be a professional football player. That’s where I spend most of my time, and that’s where, in this stage of my life, I’m called to live out my faith.”\nStille is also now living out his faith as a new dad. This summer, he and his wife welcomed their first child.\nAt Nebraska, where Stille excelled in the classroom as well as on the field, he was involved with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes . In a 2019 Instagram post, he wrote, “Had an awesome time leading a group of middle schoolers and sharing my testimony at FCA leadership camp this week! All the Glory be to God! # Ephesians 2:8-10 .”\n7. Will Anderson Jr. (Houston Texans) At the NFL Honors in February 2024, Will Anderson Jr. was one of several award winners who publicly praised God. The Houston Texans defensive end, named Defensive Rookie of the Year, said, “Without [God], none of this is possible. He deserves all the honor and praise.”\nAccording to Anderson , serving God is much more important than any football accolade. “My focus is just less on what everybody has to say and more on God,” he said this summer at training camp. “I think my biggest thing is knowing that, like I always tell y’all, my approval comes from him. Ultimately, everything that I achieve in this lifetime, I’m putting him first for it, because he’s the reason why I’m here.”\nThe 23-year-old added, “I just want to be a servant, be a leader, and be a blessing to my teammates and help them out in any type of way. So that’s my whole thing coming into this year. It’s like, ‘God, however you want to use me, I just want to be a blessing to this team.’”\nAnderson also was vocal about his faith while playing at Alabama. Now he’s teammates with outspoken Christian C.J. Stroud , last season’s Offensive Rookie of the Year.\nAnderson credited Houston’s staff for offering spiritual support during his rookie year. Last season, they helped him “be closer to God and understanding his Word and knowing how special he is and how much grace and mercy that he has over our lives.” The defensive end expressed awe at how God works, providing faith mentors and placing him in situations to show that “I always got my hand on you.”\n8. Bijan Robinson (Atlanta Falcons) For 22-year-old first-round draft pick Bijan Robinson , faith and football have been intertwined from a young age. As a child, he carried around a football like a security blanket—and once even snuck it into church. He also filled sticky notes with prayers such as “God, take me to the NFL” and “At the end of the day, make me special.”\nAfter the Atlanta Falcons drafted him eighth overall in 2023, Robinson praised the Lord, saying, “I really can’t wait to see what God has in store for me.” Telling fans he has a big heart, the running back promised to “bring my faith, my positivity, my happiness and smile” to them all.\nAlthough Robinson never knew his biological father, he was surrounded by family growing up. His grandmother was his Sunday school teacher, and his grandfather—a former college football official—guided his athletic pursuits. His aunt is now his manager.\nWhile playing college ball at Texas, Robinson described how that school’s program nurtured his faith. “None of us would be here if God wasn’t a part of our life. He blessed us to do something,” he said. “So when he’s the center and the focal piece of a team, then that’s when you start to see where you want to go and how you want to do it.”\n9. Daniel Carlson (Las Vegas Raiders) Daniel Carlson is an All-Pro, record-setting placekicker for the Las Vegas Raiders . During four years at Auburn, he never missed an extra point. Most importantly, after growing up in a Christian home, the athlete made his faith his own during college.\nCarlson , 29, shares Proverbs 3:5-6 on his social media bios: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”\nThe dad of three young children said fatherhood has helped him understand the unconditional love that God the Father has for us. On the Sports Spectrum podcast in June, Carlson expressed the relief of knowing that God will love us no matter how much we screw up. That sacrificial love and the gift of grace are “everything,” said the kicker, ahead of his seventh year as a pro.\nCarlson said he gains confidence from God’s continued faithfulness and from reading the Bible before games. The veteran player, who now leads some team Bible studies, said it’s exciting when teammates ask questions about Christianity and take steps of faith.\n10. Jalen Ramsey (Miami Dolphins) “Child of God through my faith in Christ”—that’s how Miami Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey describes himself on social media. For some people, that might appear to clash with his reputation as a trash-talker.\nBut Ramsey, who won a Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams, said he’s never cared what other people think about him. “Most of the time, their perception is wrong,” he said. “Also, I just don’t play for humans. I play for all glory to God.” The 29-year-old pushes back against people who call him cocky, saying, “Thinking less of myself” would be “doing a discredit to God,” who has “ blessed me with so much.”\nRamsey, whose grandmother is a retired pastor , is determined to raise his daughters in the faith. “They know that without Jesus Christ we’re nothing, but with Jesus Christ we’re everything,” he told CBS Sports . “They pray every single night with me. Things like that, people don’t know. But I don’t really broadcast or care to broadcast, because that’s not really why I do it. That’s not who I do it for.”\nRamsey is also serious about giving back , saying, “You’ve gotta put action with your beliefs.”\nWhen asked if he’d consider going into ministry once he hangs up his cleats, Ramsey shakes his head no. “In essence, though, I think anybody can encourage others,” he noted. “Anybody can be a pastor , right? I’ve always wanted to do it in a little bit of a different way.”\nThe cornerback said he might coach high school players someday, “encouraging the kids with not only my knowledge about the game of football but about life and about Jesus Christ.”\n11. Reid Ferguson (Buffalo Bills) Long snapper Reid Ferguson is heading into his eighth NFL season—all with the Buffalo Bills. The 30-year-old outspoken Christian has expressed gratitude for Bills chaplain Len Vanden Bos and the team’s strong core of believers. Regular chapel services, Bible studies , and couples nights provide a “breath of fresh air” spiritually, said Ferguson. Plus, they’re a “great way to get the Word in front of more guys.”\nSpeaking to Sports Spectrum in 2022, Ferguson recapped his Southern Baptist upbringing in Georgia, including his involvement with Awana and youth group . At LSU, the athlete’s church attendance slid at first, before he rededicated himself to regular worship and reconnected with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\nDuring a 2020 Facebook Live interview with Ferguson, New York Pastor Pat Jones noted that a long snapper receives little glory but is vital to the team. Similarly, all people play vital roles in the church, even if they’re not always publicly recognized.\nIn that interview, Ferguson shared tips for staying strong both physically and spiritually. “It has to be a daily thing” in both areas, he said. That’s why the athlete values opportunities to stay connected to God and to his Christ-following teammates. “Find a group of people who have your back,” Ferguson advised listeners.\nAs part of his efforts to give back to the Buffalo community, Ferguson supports military personnel and veterans. For two years in a row, he was named the Bills’ Salute to Service award nominee.",

    "text": "Un niño emitió una [criptomoneda en Solana](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/analista-preve-aumento-para-memecoin-basada-en-solana-y-otras-criptomonedas/) y ejecutó en una transmisión en vivo un esquema [«rug pull»](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/trader-gana-us-200-mil-aplicando-estafas-con-memecoins-falsas/) al vender todos sus activos para intentar afectar a los inversores.\nAunque logró sacar notables ganancias, para su sorpresa, los usuarios revirtieron rápidamente la situación y elevaron la capitalización del token en cuestión. La intención era que el menor estafador se arrepintiese de sus actos.\nDetalles sobre la estafa fallida\nEl caso se viralizó el 20 de noviembre, en varios videos compartidos en cuentas de X. El token, de nombre Quant, se emitió a través del servicio Pump.fun. Entre la transmisión vendió la totalidad de los tokens que conservaba, ejecutando un esquema conocido como rug pull (tirón de alfombra).\nCon la venta, el objetivo del menor era [tumbar el precio del token](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/un-holder-de-memecoin-provoca-una-caida-del-60-en-el-precio-entiende-lo-sucedido/). Sin embargo, los traders que seguían la transmisión reaccionaron con rapidez, y en lugar de permitir que Quant se desplomara, comenzaron a realizar operaciones para impulsar al alza su cotización.\nEl mercado del token, de tener un capital de USD 30 mil durante la transmisión, subió a USD 100 mil gracias a los [traders](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/pendle-alta-de-token-hace-a-trader-multiplicar-su-patrimonio-por-siete/). Tomando esto en cuenta, los activos vendidos por el niño fácilmente pudieron cotizarse en unos USD 4 millones, pero como no conservó ninguno, perdió potenciales ganancias bastante sustanciosas.\nSi bien el menor intentó engañar a la comunidad, este probablemente terminó viendo como lo que entendió como una victoria pudo haber sido mucho más notable. De no haber ocurrido esta estafa, el hecho no habría movido a la comunidad a dar la vuelta a la situación.\nEstafas con memecoins\nEste ejemplo cae en cuenta de que es muy fácil crear un [memecoin](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/la-memecoin-comedian-ban-se-dispara-mas-del-1-000-tras-el-anuncio-de-binance/), emitirlo y lanzarlo al mercado. Si bien muchas de estas [monedas digitales](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/que-sucedera-despues-de-la-victoria-de-trump-criptomonedas-y-otros-activos-podrian-dispararse/) se usan para operaciones comerciales, otros deciden crearlas para que sean perjudiciales a otros usuarios.\nEn este caso, el menor realizó una estafa y documentó el caso, pero felizmente sus esfuerzos fueron desechados por la comunidad de traders. Además de dar vuelta la situación, capitalizaron grandes ganancias superando los ingresos del creador del token.\nA la hora de manipular [tokens](https://www.criptofacil.com/es/templeton-migra-su-fondo-monetario-tokenizado-a-ethereum/), ya sea para su creación o comercialización, los usuarios deben ser conscientes de que estos riesgos pueden existir. Asimismo, es conveniente que toda transacción quede documentada para minimizar las posibilidades de malos resultados por desconocimiento o aspectos poco claros.",

    "text": "Altcoin\nEOS crypto rallies 20% – What’s behind the surge and can it last?\n- EOS rallied over 20%, driven by rebranding to Vaulta, high staking yields, and bullish derivatives\n- Social Dominance spiked but then cooled off; EOS price still holds steady with strong buying pressure\n[EOS [EOS]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) is making waves in the market, rallying over 20% and leaving traders buzzing about its transformation into Vaulta.\nWith staking yields poised to outshine\n[Ethereum[ETH]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) and [Solana[SOL]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) and derivatives traders betting big on more upside, EOS is shedding its stagnant past and stepping into the spotlight. But is the hype sustainable, or will profit-taking put a lid on the gains?\nCatalysts behind EOS’s surge\nThe recent EOS crypto rally can be traced to three key factors. First, the buzz around EOS’s impending rebranding to Vaulta is drawing investor attention.\nSet to launch by the end of May 2025, Vaulta aims to transform EOS into a blockchain-powered banking hub, complete with a new ticker and continued integration with exSat, the Bitcoin banking solutions.\nSecondly, the introduction of a staking yield of around 17% for the new Vaulta token is significantly higher than Ethereum’s 2.03% and Solana’s 5.14%, supported by a reward pool of roughly 250 million tokens.\nLastly, derivatives traders are showing growing confidence in EOS. According to data from CoinGlass, Open Interest (OI) in EOS futures has seen a sharp rise, reaching a recent high of approximately $170 million.\nThis represents a significant jump from the $90 million level recorded just a few weeks ago, signaling strong bullish sentiment.\nAdditionally, the data highlights EOS’s price rallying alongside the increase in OI, suggesting that traders are positioning themselves for further gains, driven by the ongoing rebranding excitement and attractive staking incentives.\nThe crowd is taking notice\nEOS’s Social Dominance has also seen a notable rise following the surge in derivatives activity. Santiment data reveals that the metric jumped to nearly 2.8% as EOS’s price climbed above $0.80, reaching its highest level in months.\nThis increase in social activity highlights the growing alignment between retail and institutional interest, driven by anticipation of the upcoming Vaulta rebranding.\nHowever, Social Dominance has since cooled off to around 0.35%, suggesting that while the initial buzz was intense, it may be tapering off.\nStill, the price remains resilient, hinting that the rally’s momentum could persist if social sentiment picks up again.",
