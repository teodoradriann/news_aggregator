Presenti i rappresentanti dei presidi ospedalieri che hanno parlato dei diversi episodi di furto e delle misure aziendali di prevenzione che sono state studiate.\n“La peculiarità del fenomeno è emersa per la rilevanza sociale della refurtiva , costituita prevalentemente da farmaci oncologici, nonché per l’ingente danno economico pari ad oltre 1,5 milioni, cagionato all’Azienda sanitaria, alla platea dei pazienti ed alla collettività” si legge nella nota della Prefettura.\nIl prefetto Signer, dopo aver ascoltato i vari rappresentanti, ha impartito una apposita direttiva per attuare una pianificazione di mirati servizi di vigilanza con una più stretta collaborazione dell’Azienda sanitaria attraverso il potenziamento degli impianti di videosorveglianza, posti a protezione delle farmacie ospedaliere, e il collegamento degli impianti con le sale operative delle forze di polizia.",

    "text": "Resilience Training for a Robust Workforce\nIn an era where change is the only constant, the corporate world is continuously evolving. Companies are realizing the critical role of employee well-being in achieving organizational success. A key component of this is resilience training, which equips employees with the skills to handle stress, adapt to change, and maintain productivity in challenging environments.\nWhat is Resilience Training?\nResilience training involves teaching individuals skills to endure and thrive during times of stress or adversity. It focuses on developing mental toughness, emotional intelligence, and adaptive skills. These trainings are designed to empower employees to manage their reactions to stress, enhance their ability to cope with challenges, and improve their overall mental health and well-being.\nImportance in the Workplace\nThe modern workplace is often a source of significant stress due to factors like tight deadlines, high expectations, and constant change. Resilience training helps employees navigate these challenges effectively. It not only benefits the individual by reducing stress and burnout but also aids the organization by improving productivity, reducing absenteeism, and enhancing employee engagement.\nComponents of Effective Resilience Training\n1. Understanding Stress and Its Impact:\nEducating employees about stress, its sources, and its effects on health and performance is crucial.\n2. Developing Emotional Intelligence:\nTraining in emotional intelligence helps employees manage their emotions and understand the emotions of others, leading to better interpersonal relationships and teamwork.\n3. Building Mental Toughness:\nThis involves cultivating a positive mindset, fostering an attitude of growth, and developing the ability to bounce back from setbacks.\n4. Teaching Coping Strategies:\nPractical skills like time management, mindfulness, and problem-solving are taught to help employees manage their workload and personal life more effectively.\n5. Encouraging Physical Wellness:\nPhysical health is closely linked to mental resilience. Incorporating elements like exercise, nutrition, and sleep hygiene is essential.\nBenefits of Resilience Training\n- Enhanced Employee Well-being:Resilience training leads to improved mental health, reduced stress, and better quality of life.\n- Increased Productivity:Resilient employees are more focused, efficient, and capable of handling high-pressure situations.\n- Improved Adaptability:Trained employees are better equipped to handle organizational changes and challenges.\n- Stronger Team Dynamics:Resilience fosters a supportive and collaborative work environment.\n- Reduced Turnover and Absenteeism:Employees who are resilient are more likely to stay with the organization and have fewer sick days.\nBest Practices for Implementing Resilience Training\n- Tailor the Training to Your Workforce:Understand the unique challenges your employees face and customize the training accordingly.\n- Incorporate a Holistic Approach:Combine mental, emotional, and physical well-being aspects.\n- Ensure Top-Down Support:Leadership endorsement is crucial for the success of any training program.\n- Make it an Ongoing Process:Resilience is developed over time, not just through one-time training.\n- Evaluate and Adapt:Regularly assess the effectiveness of the training and make necessary adjustments.\nResilience training is an essential investment in the workforce of today. It not only enhances employee well-being and productivity but also contributes to a positive and adaptive organizational culture. As companies navigate an ever-changing business landscape, having a resilient workforce is no longer just desirable, it's essential.\nReady to take your workforce's resilience to the next level? is your partner in wellness consulting.

    "title": "OpenAI accidentally erases potential evidence in training data lawsuit - The Verge",
    "text": "In a stunning misstep, OpenAI engineers accidentally erased critical evidence gathered by The New York Times and other major newspapers in their lawsuit over AI training data, according to a court filing Wednesday.\nThe newspapers’ legal teams had spent over 150 hours searching through OpenAI’s AI training data to find instances where their news articles were included, the filing claims. But it doesn’t explain how this mistake occurred or what precisely the data included. While the filing says OpenAI admitted to the error and tried to recover the data, what it managed to salvage was incomplete and unreliable — so what was recovered cannot help properly trace how the news organizations’ articles were used in building OpenAI’s AI models. While OpenAI’s lawyers characterized the data erasure as a “glitch,” The New York Times’ attorneys noted they had “no reason to believe” it was intentional.\nThe New York Times Company launched this landmark battle last December, claiming OpenAI and its partner Microsoft had built their AI tools by “copying and using millions” of the publication’s articles and now “directly compete” with its content as a result. The publication is asking for OpenAI to be held liable for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” for allegedly copying its works.\nThe Times has already spent more than $1 million battling OpenAI in court — a significant fee few publishers can match. Meanwhile, OpenAI has struck deals with major outlets like Axel Springer, Conde Nast, and The Verge’s parent company Vox Media, suggesting many publishers would rather partner than fight.\nOpenAI declined to join The New York Times in filing the update to the court. This declaration was filed by Jennifer Maisel, an attorney representing the news organizations, to formally notify the court about what happened.\nIn an email to The Verge , OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom said that the company disagrees with the characterizations made, and will file its own response soon. The New York Times declined The Verge ’s request for comment.",

    "title": "¿Por qué recomiendan DESACTIVAR Meta AI de WhatsApp 2024? Te decimos",
    "text": "El avance de la tecnología ha permeado en múltiples plataformas y aplicaciones digitales, tal como ocurre con WhatsApp y el arribo de su inteligencia artificial denominada como [Meta AI](https://www.mediotiempo.com/otros-mundos/whatsapp-estas-son-las-preguntas-y-temas-prohibidos-en-meta-ia). A pesar de ser una herramienta que puede proporcionar cierta utilidad a los usuarios digitales, algunos han puntualizado que Meta AI ha generado ciertas problemáticas a la hora de utilizarla. Aquí te compartimos cuáles han sido las inconformidades de diversas personas y por qué recomiendan desactivarla en WhatsApp. ¿Por qué piden desactivar Meta AI? Tras haber aplicado su actualización, WhatsApp implementó dentro del programa de mensajería la opción de utilizar Meta AI como una herramienta para consultar dudas de diversos tópicos. Sin embargo, muchos usuarios han advertido que existen una serie de desventajas a la hora de hacer uso de este programa, entre los cuales destacan los siguientes: Poca precisión y veracidad en datos de la IA: en algunos casos se ha destacado la difusión de información falsa o de dudosa fuente a la hora de ser proporcionada por Meta AI. Daño al ambiente: el uso de la inteligencia artificial puede llegar a consumir hasta la mitad de la carga de los dispositivos móviles, destacando esto a través de la generación de imágenes con la IA. Genera distracciones: utilizar demasiado tiempo Meta AI puede ser un factor de distracción, por lo que las actividades o tareas de las personas pueden verse interrumpidas si se enajenan con el uso de la herramienta. Monotonía creativa: para muchos, Meta AI carece de un estilo variado a la hora de proporcionar respuestas o contenido gráfico, por lo que muchos aseguran que esta función está programada para brindar respuestas básicas y puntuales sobre diversos temas. Limita la innovación: Meta AI no es considerada con limitaciones creativas únicamente, sino que también puede generar un impacto nocivo en la curiosidad humana. Al brindar una síntesis sobre temas de gran trascendencia, las personas creen que esto puede acabar con el interés de profundizar y debatir más allá de las primeras impresiones sobre ciertos tópicos. Además, otra de las dudas que ha generado el uso de Meta AI es la pérdida de privacidad informática, aunque WhatsApp asegura que los chats cuentan con un cifrado extremo a extremo, lo cual prohibe a la inteligencia artificial leer o analizar los mensajes de los usuarios. ¿Cómo desactivar Meta AI? Ante todo este contexto de dudas y opiniones, muchos han optado por seguir la recomendación de desactivar la inteligencia artificial de WhatsApp. La desactivación de Meta AI ayuda a tener menos contacto con ella, aunque no es posible eliminarla por completo de la app. Estos son los pasos que debes seguir si deseas desactivar Meta AI de WhatsApp: - Abre la conversación con Meta AI en WhatsApp. - Tocar el botón de los tres puntos verticales en la parte superior derecha. - Presiona la opción Eliminar conversación o Eliminar chat. - Confirma que deseas borrar el chat. Aunque sigas estos pasos, la barra de búsqueda en la parte superior de WhatsApp seguirá presente. Dicha herramienta no se puede eliminar y, en caso de oprimirla por error, la conversación volverá a aparecer. Para ello puedes también silenciar el chat con Meta AI para siempre y archivarlo para no tenerlo en tu bandeja principal. Estos serían los pasos para hacerlo: - Abre la conversación con Meta AI. - Mantén apretado el chat hasta que aparezca la opción de Silenciar notificaciones y seleccionar la opción Siempre. - Después deberás volver a mantener apretado el chat y clickear en los tres puntos de la parte superior derecha, para seleccionar la opción de Archivar chat.",

Israel struck near Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, state media reported Photo : Twitter Israeli air strikes hit near the Syrian capital Damascus and in the country's south on Thursday, the defence ministry and state media said. \"At approximately 23:05 (20:05 GMT) today, the Israeli enemy carried out air strikes from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting some points in the southern region,\" the defence ministry said in a statement, reporting no casualties. Israel rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow arch-foe Iran, which backs President Bashar al-Assad's government, to expand its presence in the country. \"Our air defences are intercepting hostile targets in the vicinity of Damascus,\" official news agency SANA said. \"An Israeli attack targeted the vicinity of the capital Damascus,\" state television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported Israeli strikes targeting a Syrian air defence position in the country's southern Sweida province, as well as near Damascus international airport. The attack near the airport came \"one whole day after the airport resumed flights,\" said the British-based monitor with a network inside Syria. Damascus international airport had been out of service since Israeli strikes targeted it in late November, just hours after flights resumed following similar attacks the previous month. Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbour since Syria's civil war began in 2011, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces including Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. But it has intensified attacks since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, as tensions rise across the Middle East.

    "title": "France's far right might 'jeopardise' efforts to 'reinforce European defence'",
    "text": "With the increasing likelihood of a significant shift in France&#039;s political landscape is leading to concerns across the policy spectrum, not least with regards to foreign policy. Bardella says that France would not send troops or long range missiles to Ukraine under his government, but he did acknowledge dangers to European security presented by Russia. Take a listen here. My red line is very clear. It&#039;s the sending of troops to Ukrainian territory. I do not plan to create the conditions for and put in place the deployment of French troops into Ukrainian territory. That&#039;s my position, the position of our movement, and it has not changed. For more on the subject, I&#039;m joined by Jean Paul Palomaros. He&#039;s former supreme commander of NATO&#039;s allied forces and former Air Force chief of staff here in France. Mr. Palomaros, thanks for taking the time to be with us. How do you interpret the national rallies stated position on Russia as a threat to Europe given that the party has been financed by Russian interests in the past and until recently refused to take a firm position on that Ukraine war? Well, as we can see defense is not at the forefront of this elections, legislative elections and and this is a true for the two extreme party, if I may say. So here we have Mr. Bardela. There&#039;s a lot of subject which are still on the table like the what will happen with NATO and how much support each party would deliver to Ukraine. And we have heard that the long range missiles, for instance, which are so crucial, are not obviously part of what the National Rally will will provide to the Ukraine. But we must remember for all our our deterrence is that the the defence is a domain reserve of the chief of of the state, Mr. Macron. So, but on the other hand, the the deputy have to to vote for the budget, defence budget. So we have we have there a big question, how much they will supported the overall defence effort to overall defence policy, which is really supported by the the the Mr. Macron President, how much they will support the effort for the world economy as it started in support to Ukraine. This is still to be that. I mean, I see there an ambiguity and only two parties are clear on this domain so far, the Republican and the Mr. Atal party, because obviously they are on the line. The second one are on the line of the President and the 2nd and the Republican, they have stated their position for they&#039;ve been stating their position for a while. I&#039;m Speaking of those who are not who didn&#039;t join the National Rally. Well, obviously the mainstream political sphere fairly troubled by the national rallies rise as 170 current and former French diplomats published an open letter just today warning that a far right victory would weaken French and European security at a time on the continent is seeing its widest ongoing land war since World War 2. Let&#039;s take a listen right now to an excerpt from that letter. Our opponents will read a far right victory as France weakening and an invitation to interfere in our national politics, to be aggressive against Europe, including militarily to the economic vassalisation of France and the continents. Our country&#039;s cracked armour will expose it to more blows from them, delivered with increased energy, spreading the poison of division, communitarianism, racism and anti-Semitism, and threatening both national cohesion and security. Mr. Palomaros, if I could, what would be your concerns for French and European military security overall, if the National Rally were to win these elections? Would you be concerned about increased Russian meddling in security policies? Of course, of course, the Russian will take any opportunity, but not only with the far right but with the far left as well. We know there are connections with Mr. Melenshaw, La Francis Sumiz. So we, we must take a very balanced view on the extreme parties who are really not clear about their position towards Russia and their position overall position about defence. Let&#039;s see on the extreme left, defence is not there. There is not a single word about military, about defence in their in their program. So we don&#039;t, we don&#039;t know. And we know that there are positions between Mr. Merschaan, the one hand and Mr. and Mr. Glestman. So, and this is true for Europe, the European dimension, this is true for NATO. So we have two extreme which are not clear regarding their position to, to, to, to this situation vis a vis Russia. So, but again, there we will, we will have a balanced question about the President&#039;s role in the foreign affairs and in defence and the role of the ruling party, if there is one, if there is one to towards the defence and foreign affairs policy. That will be the first time I think in the French recent history that we could come to this position because before when we have computations, we are more or less on the on the same path with the socialist the the right. Well, there was no big discrepancies. The nuclear was very clearly part of the inventory, etcetera, etcetera. So, yeah, very, very worrying situation, I can say for defence and for military. Well, since you brought it up, let&#039;s turn to the other side of the political spectrum now, the left coalition, the New Popular Front. Obviously, there has been in the past some significant ambivalence about Ukraine and Russia from some of the more leftward elements like left France and Sumis Francis Baud. It seems, though, that the NFP has managed to find some consensus on supporting Ukraine against Russia. Do you then think that that commitment would hold after the elections or no? Well, difficult to say because for the time being we have no real program. So supporting as a principle, yes, I know that they&#039;ve written somewhere that they will support in in giving the weapons to Ukraine. We don&#039;t know which weapons, but this is a starter. So, but if you look back a little bit on the history of this coalition, that will be a tough challenge for them to come with a concrete and, and I would say positive position on, on this specific domain because their vision is, is very different. And, and, and speaking as well of the defense of Europe, It&#039;s so yes, but we are not there yet. This is why it&#039;s, it&#039;s a bit concerning coming from extreme right, extreme left for, for the military, for defence and, and, and we need to keep on the, the defence efforts to be up to the, the challenges of security in Europe. That&#039;s for sure. Well, on that subject to wrap up, I think here, President Macron has been pushing hard in in recent months, in fact, throughout his second mandate for for more European military sovereignty, he calls it. Do you think that a big loss for his Renaissance party in these elections will mean a big step back from these European efforts to build up a military and security capabilities independent of the US? Well, again, there is an ambiguity. Let&#039;s take now the extreme right to say we need more sovereignty, OK, we need to invest in our defence. But they are not very clear on how much this question of defence extend as well to to Europe. They are defending national interest, which is perfectly acceptable. But we don&#039;t know to, to which stage they will come back on the, the, the progress, if I may say so, of a European defense and to which level they they will keep it so kind of ambiguity. But to there is a risk that, yes, the, the effort which has been done to reinforce European defense as a whole would be jeopardized. There is a risk, you see. All right, Jean Paul Parrameros, former supreme commander of the NATO, Allied of Forces and former Air Force chief of staff here in France. That&#039;s all I have time for. Thank you so much though for your insight.",

    "text": "O Corinthians voltou de Caracas, na Venezuela, com um grande problema para o técnico Ramón Díaz. Substituído logo aos 18 minutos do duelo de ida com o Universidad Central pela 2ª rodada da fase prévia da Libertadores, o volante Raniele teve uma lesão muscular de grau 2 detectada e está fora do jogo de volta, de um possível embate da terceira fase e do Paulistão.\n“O meio-campista Raniele sofreu uma lesão de grau dois no bíceps femoral da coxa direita. Nesta sexta-feira (21), o camisa 14 iniciará a recuperação com a equipe de fisioterapia”, informou o Corinthians.\nOs problemas musculares de grau 2 costumam demandar até seis semanas de recuperação. Desta maneira, Raniele só voltaria no Brasileirão e caso o Corinthians avance à fase de grupos da Libertadores. Já garantido nas quartas do Estadual, o duelo eliminatória ocorre já no fim de semana do carnaval, possivelmente dia 1º de março. A competição acaba no dia 23.\nJá no caso da Libertadores, o Corinthians recebe o Universidad Central já na quarta-feira, dia 26, e caso avance – empatou por 1 a 1 fora de casa – teria um último mata-mata nos outros dois meios de semana.\nBreno Bidon, de volta da seleção sub-20 onde conquistou o Sul-Americano, surge como favorito à vaga. Mas, como atua como segundo homem de marcação, deixaria José Martinez como primeiro volante. Outra opção seria Charles, já que Alex Santana, Ryan e Maycon também não são volante de primeiro combate.\nRaniele vinha se firmando no Corinthians depois de perder a vaga em 2024. E estava empolgado por crescer de rendimento a cada rodada e recuperar a confiança da torcida e de Ramón Díaz.",
