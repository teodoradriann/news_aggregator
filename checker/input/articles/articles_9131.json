    "text": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham\nThe Gunners went down 2-0 at home\nArsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nHis West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nArsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nArsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nFormer West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",

    "text": "Ahoua Don Mello, vice-président de l’Alliance internationale des Brics, déclare àMondafrique: « Les déguerpissements sont une opération d’accroissement de la pauvreté » Ancien directeur général du Bureau national d’études techniques et de développement (Bnetd) et rompu aux questions de planification du développement, Ahoua Don Mello analyse les opérations déguerpissements qui ont eu lieu dans la ville d’Abidjan et explique pourquoi cela constitue un accélérateur de pauvreté. Correspondance à Abidjan, Bati Abouè Mondafrique. Avec beaucoup de recul, qu’avez-vous pensé des déguerpissements et celui d’Adjamé en particulier, vous qui avez été pendant dix directeur général du Bureau national d’études techniques et de développement (Bnetd) ? Pour répondre à votre question, je dirai que le déguerpissement au sein du village d’Adjamé, qui aurait dû être une opération de développement du village, est devenu une opération d’accroissement de la pauvreté, de la mortalité et de la mauvaise gouvernance. Il exprime le caractère non démocratique de l’état de Côte d’Ivoire. Car cela montre que le pouvoir s’exerce contre le peuple au lieu d’être exercé par le peuple et pour le peuple. Mondafrique. En tant qu’ancien patron du Bnetd, qu’est-ce que l’Etat a prévu pour les villages Atchans en particulier ? Et que répondez-vous au ministre de la construction et de l’urbanisme qui s’étonne qu’il y ait encore des villages à Abidjan avec un mode de vie qui ne reflèterait pas celui de notre capitale ? Les techniques et les communautés villageoises évoluent avec le temps ainsi que les besoins et les aspirations de ces communautés. Les techniques de planification urbaine sont passées de la planification technocratique qui se faisait par des experts sans la participation de la population à une planification démocratique qui se fait avec la participation de la population dans l’intérêt des populations. Les besoins socio-économiques des villages atchans sont passés des besoins primaires à des besoins secondaires et tertiaires compte tenu du caractère urbain de la ville d’Abidjan et de l’élévation du niveau de formation et d’éducation de sa population. La planification de la rénovation urbaine doit donc permettre de prendre en compte la création de nouvelles opportunités d’emplois et d’entrepreunariats pour la communauté et un nouveau mode de vie définit de concert avec la population qui épouse l’histoire, la géographie, la culture et la modernité de la population qui a intégré en son sein de nouvelles communautés. Mondafrique. Quelle traduction politique aux récriminations du fait de ces déguerpissements? Cela prouve qu’il faut changer d’approche pour prendre en compte les justes récriminations et les nouvelles aspirations de la communauté. Ceci dit, faut-il détruire les villages pour qu’Abidjan en soit débarrassé une fois pour toute comme semble le suggérer le ministre Bruno Koné, ou les intégrer dans le plan de développement global de la ville ? Si une planification urbaine se fait avec la participation de la population, il n’y aura aucune contradiction entre les besoins actuels de la communauté et les besoins modernes qui sont aussi ses besoins. Sous notre magistère, le Bnetd a eu une approche du développement qui consiste à s’inspirer des meilleurs exemples au monde pour les adapter au contexte socio-économique de la population bénéficiaire du développement. Et l’exemple marocain et brésilien ont retenu notre attention lorsqu’il a fallu proposer un programme de rénovation de la ville d’Abidjan qui a donné naissance au programme du grand Abidjan et au programme de transfert de la capitale. En effet, la densité de la population d’Abidjan approche les 200 habitants au km2 contre une moyenne de 80 à l’intérieur du pays. Abidjan exerce donc une forte attractivité compte tenu de la concentration des activités publiques et privées modernes et de la concentration des investissements publics de modernisation des infrastructures urbaines. En conséquence, la rénovation de la ville d’Abidjan devait être conduite de pair avec le transfert de la capitale à Yamoussoukro pour rééquilibrer l’attractivité des villes de Côte d’Ivoire ainsi que les opportunités d’emplois et d’entrepreunariats. Quel a été pour vous le meilleur exemple entre le Brésil et le Maroc à cet égard ? L’exemple marocain offrait une expérience intéressante, vu que la population participait à la conception et à la construction de son futur et à la démolition de son passé qui était dépassé. Cela préservait l’essentiel de son patrimoine historique et culturel d’une manière homogène sur toute l’étendue du territoire par la puissance d’une véritable politique de décentralisation administrative et socioéconomique. L’expérience Brésilienne de transfert de la capitale de Rio de Janeiro à Brasilia a permis de voir une nouvelle ville aux normes environnementales avancées et à la pointe de la technologie avec le développement industriel, urbain, scolaire et sanitaire des villes environnantes pour satisfaire les besoins modernes de la population administrative et politique de Brasilia. Le transfert de la capitale à Brasilia a permis de développer l’attractivité des villes secondaires. Le régime du Président Ouattara a abandonné ces options et la multiplication des infrastructures à Abidjan ne fait qu’accroître son attractivité et donc une augmentation incontrôlée de la population abidjannaise ainsi que le déséquilibre du développement national. Abidjan s’hypertrophie tandis que les villes de l’intérieur s’atrophient. D’ailleurs, Abidjan est devenu une succession de lotissements avec une succession de bitumes et de béton sans espace environnemental et sans un projet urbain capable d’absorber la population, le trafic et l’eau en saison des pluies. Est-ce que ces déguerpissements peuvent provoquer la désintégration des villages et donc leurs habitants ? Absolument. Le déguerpissement d’Adjamé nous fait tous prendre conscience des risques de désintégration que fait courir le gouvernement d’Alassane Ouattara aux villages incrustés dans la ville. Que faut-il faire maintenant pour anticiper les problèmes de survie de ces entités que l’on perçoit clairement aujourd’hui ? Faut-il convoquer des états généraux ou un dialogue national autour de cette question ? Il faut populariser la méthode mise au point par le Bnetd suite à plusieurs missions d’évaluation des réponses aux problèmes similaires à travers le monde.",

    "text": "El 10% más rico de la población mundial es responsable de dos tercios del calentamiento global observado desde 1990 y del consiguiente aumento de fenómenos climáticos extremos.\nEs la conclusión de un nuevo estudio publicado en Nature Climate Change que cuantifica las consecuencias climáticas de las desigualdades sociales, detalla Europa Press.\nPublicidad\nEl estudio evalúa la contribución de los grupos con mayores emisiones dentro de las sociedades y descubre que el 1% más rico del mundo contribuyó 26 veces más que el promedio mundial a los aumentos de los extremos de calor mensuales (1 cada 100 años) a nivel mundial y 17 veces más a las sequías en la Amazonía.\nPublicidad\nLa investigación arroja nueva luz sobre los vínculos entre la desigualdad de emisiones basada en los ingresos y la injusticia climática, ilustrando cómo el consumo y las inversiones de las personas adineradas han tenido impactos desproporcionados en los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos.\nEstos impactos son especialmente graves en regiones tropicales vulnerables como la Amazonia, el Sudeste Asiático y el sur de África, todas ellas zonas que históricamente han contribuido menos a las emisiones globales.\n“Nuestro estudio demuestra que los impactos climáticos extremos no son solo el resultado de emisiones globales abstractas, sino que podemos vincularlos directamente con nuestro estilo de vida y nuestras decisiones de inversión, que a su vez están vinculadas a la riqueza”, explica la autora principal, Sarah Schöngart, exalumna del Programa de Verano de Jóvenes Científicos (YSSP) de 2024, actualmente asociada a la ETH de Zúrich.\nPublicidad\n“Descubrimos que los emisores adinerados desempeñan un papel importante en el impulso de los extremos climáticos, lo que respalda firmemente las políticas climáticas orientadas a la reducción de sus emisiones”, añadió.\nLa mayoría de plásticos que contaminan Galápagos vienen del continente: las costas del sur de Ecuador y el norte de Perú son los principales emisores\nLos jets privados de las celebridades y su enorme huella de carbono: Taylor Swift en primer lugar de la lista\nUtilizando un novedoso marco de modelado que combina datos económicos y simulaciones climáticas, los investigadores pudieron rastrear las emisiones de diferentes grupos de ingresos globales y evaluar su contribución a extremos climáticos específicos. Descubrieron que las emisiones del 10 % más rico de las personas, solo en Estados Unidos y China, provocaron un aumento de dos a tres veces en los extremos de calor en las regiones vulnerables.\nPublicidad\n“Si todos hubiéramos emitido como el 50% más pobre de la población mundial, el mundo habría experimentado un calentamiento adicional mínimo desde 1990”, afirma el coautor Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, quien dirige el Grupo de Investigación Integrada sobre Impactos Climáticos del IIASA. “Abordar este desequilibrio es crucial para una acción climática justa y eficaz”.\nEl estudio también enfatiza la importancia de las emisiones inherentes a las inversiones financieras, más allá del simple consumo personal. Los autores argumentan que focalizar los flujos financieros y las carteras de las personas con altos ingresos podría generar beneficios climáticos sustanciales.\n“Este no es un debate académico; se trata de los impactos reales de la crisis climática actual”, añade Schleussner. “La acción climática que no aborde las enormes responsabilidades de los miembros más ricos de la sociedad corre el riesgo de descuidar uno de los mecanismos más poderosos que tenemos para reducir los daños futuros”.\nLos autores sugieren que sus hallazgos podrían motivar instrumentos de política progresistas dirigidos a las élites sociales, señalando que dichas políticas también pueden fomentar la aceptación social de la acción climática. Hacer que los ricos que contaminan paguen también puede contribuir a brindar el tan necesario apoyo para la adaptación y la gestión de pérdidas y daños en los países vulnerables.\nPublicidad\nConcluyen que reequilibrar la responsabilidad de la acción climática en consonancia con las contribuciones reales a las emisiones es esencial, no solo para frenar el calentamiento global, sino para lograr un mundo más justo y resiliente.
