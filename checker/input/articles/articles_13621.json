    "text": "Mom Of Teen Cuffed For Sleeping During Court Field Trip Says Daughter’s Fatigue Was Due To Family Not Having A ‘Permanent’ Home\nMom Of Teen Cuffed For Sleeping During Court Field Trip Says Daughter’s Fatigue Was Due To Family Not Having A ‘Permanent’ Home\nThe mother of a 15-year-old Detroit teenager put in handcuffs during a group trip is calling out the acting\njudge.\nLatoreya Till condemned\nJudge Kenneth King for placing her daughter in cuffs after she fell asleep in the courtroom earlier this week, arguing that the family’s living situation has greatly impacted the young girl’s life.\nLatoreya Till spoke about the matter during a phone interview, claiming that her daughter Eva Goodman is now afraid to return to work and face her peers following the incident. She stated:\n“My daughter is hurt. She is feeling scared. She didn’t want to go to work. She feels like as if her peers went against her. She was real nervous and intimidated.”\nShe added about the family’s current housing situation:\n“We have to bounce around currently because we don’t have a permanent address. And so, that particular night, we got in kind of late. And usually, when she goes to work, she’s up and planting trees or being active.”\nEva Goodman works with a local non-profit organization called The Greening Project, which works to improve the “green infrastructure” of the city. On Tuesday (August 12th), Goodman and others associated with the project attended 36th District\nhttps://thejasminebrand.com/2024/07/30/young-thugs-latest-bond-attempt-denied-by-new-judge/ Kenneth King’s courtroom to watch proceedings and learn from the judge. However, Goodman allegedly fell asleep multiple times, which caused the judge to grow frustrated.\nIn Video footage, Judge King yelled at Goodman to wake up before claiming she’d be detained if she drifted off again. King then had officers take Goodman outside of the court where she sat for two hours before being allowed to return. The judge furthered the teen’s reprimanding by berating her for falling asleep and threatening jail time. It’s reported that he also asked her coworkers to raise their hands if they felt she should spend time behind bars.\nIn addition, the teen allegedly had to remove her clothes and put on a green jumpsuit, though it’s clarified no one was present while she undressed.\nJudge King reaffirmed his decision in a separate interview, making it clear he doesn’t think he was “heavy-handed,” adding:\n“Do I have any reservations?…No, I don’t because I’ll do whatever needs to be done to reach these kids and make sure they don’t end up in front of me. So that was my own version of scared straight.”\nTill went on to state that upon watching footage of the incident herself, she doesn’t feel her daughter was giving King “attitude” as he claimed, and added that Goodman isn’t aware of courtroom etiquette as she’s never been inside one or in trouble. Till is reportedly exploring legal action against King.\nDo you think Judge King was wrong?

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

With over 4,600 units approved to be built or being built the town does not need anymore development at this time.If this annexation had happened the residents of this town even the Villagers would be on the hook for millions and millions of dollars for infrastructure improvements.We would be taxed out of our homes like the people of Wildwood are now finding out.\nTo Commissioner Gourlie, who is afraid that the town will disappear without all this growth, and is pro-growth, this town will celebrate our centennial next October and is on the way to another hundred years. I do not think this town is going to disappear. With the areas around us expanding as much as they are there will always be places for people to live. Even in Lady Lake people die, people find different jobs and other people come into our town and take their place. Let’s keep Lady lake the small town in the area that people move to because of it being small with reasonable taxes. I would also like the to thank the residents of Lady Lake that showed up Monday night. Let’s not make it a one-time event. We need you to show up at commission meetings and let the leaders of the town know how you would like the town to be managed. This could happen again and we need to let them know it is not what we want.\nTo the people of the community surrounding Grand Oaks, I also want to say thank you to you and especially Kathleen Farner who spear headed their protest and had the foresight to bring in a very competent attorney to state their case. I am sure she had a big impact on the vote. Keep vigilant, because this may not be the end of this.\nRichard Masso is a resident of the Town of Lady Lake.",
