    "title": "“An open wound on the international conscience” believes Bassirou Diomaye Faye",
    "text": "AA/ Dakar/ Alioune Ndiaye The Senegalese President, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, deplored on Wednesday the tragic situation which persists in Palestine, describing the war from which it arises “an open wound on the international conscience”. Faye, who spoke at the 79th ordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, called for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. “I once again express Senegal’s concern about the tragic situation that persists in Palestine. Entire generations have grown up there under the shadow of oppression, deprived of their fundamental right to a viable state,” the president underlined. Faye. “This war, which spares neither women, nor children, nor vital infrastructure, is an open wound on the international conscience,” he said, reiterating on behalf of his country, which chairs the Committee for exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, its support for the two-state solution. “It is imperative that international humanitarian law be reestablished in all conflict zones,” he advised, not without deploring numerous violations of international law around the world. “We see every day that international law, the cement of world peace, is often violated. Resolutions adopted by this same Assembly are ignored. By tolerating these repeated violations, we are trampling underfoot the principles of the United Nations Charter,” he argued. President Faye also pointed out the inertia of the United Nations on the situation in the Sahel. “We can no longer turn a blind eye to the tragedy unfolding in the Sahel (…) This region, once stable, is now prey to daily violence, while the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, too often remain inert,” noted Faye. “Similarly, we cannot accept that the Sahel becomes the scene of rivalries between foreign powers,” he continued, recalling that the peace and security of Africa are inseparable from world peace. “It is imperative that the Security Council fully fulfills its role as guarantor of international stability,” he said. “Leaving no one behind: acting together for peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations” is the theme of the general debate of the session.

    "title": "Juan Soto admits one key factor could endear him to Bronx as free agency looms",
    "text": "What's it going to take to keep The Generational Juan Soto in pinstripes for life?\nBy Jonna Perlinger | 5:41 PM EST\n2024 New York Yankees Spring Training / New York Yankees/GettyImages\nExcitement is permeating through the Bronx as the Bombers’ marquee offseason acquisition Juan Soto elevated the Yankees’ positioning to compete for their 28th World Series Championship.\nAs Soto’s one-year residency gets underway, however, fans can’t help but look ahead to what it’s going to take for the organization to keep the 26-year-old Dominican Republic-native in pinstripes for the remainder of his career upon his free agency next offseason. Fortunately for the Yankees , Soto hinted at one factor that just might tip the scale their way in the campaign.\nUpon reporting to the Yankees’ camp at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa last week, Soto took the stage in the press room almost immediately as reporters were eager to hear from “The Generational Juan Soto.” The outfielder was donning a shirt that said exactly that.\nThat’s the thing about Juan Soto. He is a player of generational talent, and at the ripe age of just 25 years old, he has already been traded twice—a rarity for a player of his talent. In a more recent interview, The Athletic’s Chris Kirschner asked him about that.\n\"The first time I got traded, it really hurt big time. I’ve said it before but I cried the whole morning. After that trade, I learned that this is a business. You just have to follow through with it and see what happens at the end of the day. It was hard. It was tough. But we’re here to keep grinding,\" Soto said.\nJuan Soto has several reasons to stay with New York Yankees It's possible Soto won’t want to relocate yet again, but what is it going to take to make “The Generational Juan Soto” feel at home in the Bronx? A World Series Championship certainly can’t hurt, nor can batting ahead of the AL single-season home run record holder in the lineup. But he eluded to one other thing in his interview with Kirschner that just may help the Yankees in their campaign.\nKirschner asked about what it would be like for Soto playing in front of New York's large Dominican community at Yankee Stadium come April 5.\n“I think it’s going to be great,” replied Soto. “It’s going to be really exciting. It’s going to be unbelievable. It’s going to feel like the World Baseball Classic every night.”\nIt’s no secret the native’s Caribbean home country harbors a lot of Yankee fans. Soto was once one of them. He grew up idolizing the Yankees’ former second baseman Robinson Canó (2005-13). In an interview done with the Washington Post in 2019, Soto’s rookie year, Soto mentioned that his idol once FaceTimed him.\n“I didn’t recognize the number and they were trying to FaceTime me,” Soto told the Washington Post. “Then I swipe to answer and it is Robinson Canó. He starts talking and me? I am speechless. I didn’t know what to say.”\nCanó told The Washington Post in a follow-up interview that he, similarly, had idolized Bernie Williams and was later able to play alongside him. He said he took “a lot of pride in being someone that he looks up to.”\nThe Juan Soto campaign will be one of the biggest in recent history as he and his agent Scott Boras look to secure a high-dollar, long-term deal next offseason, but for now, the Bronx Zoo should enjoy what’s in front of them and take solace in the promise that the Dominican community in the Bronx just may have this generational talent feeling like he has finally landed at home.\n5 New York Yankees who could be traded before Opening Day. 5 New York Yankees who could be traded before Opening Day. dark.

    "text": "Rosalía y Alejandro Sanz se aliaron este jueves para dar una sorpresa a Manuel Alejandro , al que visitaron en su casa con motivo de la fiesta de Reyes Magos , ante la emoción del compositor , que se abrazó varias veces a la cantante catalana.\n\"Te traigo un regalito, mira, es que me la he encontrado en la calle y digo, pobrecita, vamos a darla un café aunque sea\", decía Sanz mientras entraba en el salón de la casa de Manuel Alejandro , seguido de Rosalía , según se puede ver en un vídeo que el cantante ha colgado este viernes en sus redes sociales.\nRosalía se acercaba con una gran sonrisa al compositor de títulos como 'Yo soy aquel', 'Como una ola' o 'Yo soy rebelde', que a sus 91 años se levantó rápidamente del sillón para abrazarse emocionado a la cantante .\n\"¿Qué haces aquí?\", le decía el músico a Rosalía , que también emocionada le respondía: \"Te he venido a ver. Te dije que vendría, ¿no te lo dije? Yo lo decía de verdad. Maestro, ¿cómo estás?\".\nMientras, Alejandro Sanz contemplaba la escena sonriendo y se acercó después al compositor para preguntarle si le había gustado la sorpresa .\nRosalía deslumbró en la última edición de los Grammy Latinos, que se celebró en noviembre en Sevilla.\nLa artista cantó una particular versión de 'Se nos rompió el amor', uno de los grandes éxitos de Manuel Alejandro , conocido en la voz de Rocío Jurado.\nEn sus redes el cantante colgó el vídeo del encuentro, así como tres fotos, en una de las cuales aparecía disfrazado de Rey Melchor, y un breve texto.\n\"Hablando de reyes y reinas, ayer compartí con dos de sus majestades y os puedo asegurar que la magia estaba presente. Así, queda escrito un capítulo más en la historia de la música Gracias padrino Manuel Alejandro y a mi hermadrina @rosalia por apretarme el corazón Os deseo una noche llena de deseos cumplidos. Fdo: Melchor\", decía el mensaje de Alejandro Sanz .\nVideo del momento Rosalía y Manuel Alejandro.

    "text": "Break the silence: a world war is beckoning 13 May 2014 Why do we tolerate the threat of another world war in our name? Why do we allow lies that justify this risk? The scale of our indoctrination, wrote Harold Pinter, is a \"brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of hypnosis\", as if the truth \"never happened even while it was happening\". Every year the American historian William Blum publishes his \"updated summary of the record of US foreign policy\" which shows that, since 1945, the US has tried to overthrow more than 50 governments, many democratically elected; grossly interfered in elections in 30 countries; bombed the civilian populations of 30 countries; used chemical and biological weapons; and attempted to assassinate foreign leaders. In many cases Britain has been a collaborator. The degree of human suffering, let alone criminality, is little acknowledged in the west, despite the presence of the world's most advanced communications and nominally freest journalism. That the most numerous victims of terrorism - \"our\" terrorism - are Muslims, is unsayable. That extreme jihadism, which led to 9/11, was nurtured as a weapon of Anglo-American policy (Operation Cyclone in Afghanistan) is suppressed. In April the US state department noted that, following Nato's campaign in 2011, \"Libya has become a terrorist safe haven\". The name of \"our\" enemy has changed over the years, from communism to Islamism, but generally it is any society independent of western power and occupying strategically useful or resource-rich territory. The leaders of these obstructive nations are usually violently shoved aside, such as the democrats Muhammad Mossedeq in Iran and Salvador Allende in Chile, or they are murdered like Patrice Lumumba in the Congo. All are subjected to a western media campaign of caricature and vilification - think Fidel Castro, Hugo Chávez, now Vladimir Putin. Washington's role in Ukraine is different only in its implications for the rest of us. For the first time since the Reagan years, the US is threatening to take the world to war. With eastern Europe and the Balkans now military outposts of Nato, the last \"buffer state\" bordering Russia is being torn apart. We in the west are backing neo-Nazis in a country where Ukrainian Nazis backed Hitler. Having masterminded the coup in February against the democratically elected government in Kiev, Washington's planned seizure of Russia's historic, legitimate warm-water naval base in Crimea failed. The Russians defended themselves, as they have done against every threat and invasion from the west for almost a century. But Nato's military encirclement has accelerated, along with US-orchestrated attacks on ethnic Russians in Ukraine. If Putin can be provoked into coming to their aid, his pre-ordained \"pariah\" role will justify a Nato-run guerrilla war that is likely to spill into Russia itself. Instead, Putin has confounded the war party by seeking an accommodation with Washington and the EU, by withdrawing troops from the Ukrainian border and urging ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine to abandon the weekend's provocative referendum. These Russian-speaking and bilingual people - a third of Ukraine's population - have long sought a democratic federation that reflects the country's ethnic diversity and is both autonomous and independent of Moscow. Most are neither \"separatists\" nor \"rebels\" but citizens who want to live securely in their homeland. Like the ruins of Iraq and Afghanistan, Ukraine has been turned into a CIA theme park - run by CIA director John Brennan in Kiev, with \"special units\" from the CIA and FBI setting up a \"security structure\" that oversees savage attacks on those who opposed the February coup. Watch the videos, read the eye-witness reports from the massacre in Odessa this month. Bussed fascist thugs burned the trade union headquarters, killing 41 people trapped inside. Watch the police standing by. A doctor described trying to rescue people, \"but I was stopped by pro-Ukrainian Nazi radicals. One of them pushed me away rudely, promising that soon me and other Jews of Odessa are going to meet the same fate... I wonder, why the whole world is keeping silent.\" Russian-speaking Ukrainians are fighting for survival. When Putin announced the withdrawal of Russian troops from the border, the Kiev junta's defence secretary - a founding member of the fascist Svoboda party - boasted that the attacks on \"insurgents\" would continue. In Orwellian style, propaganda in the west has inverted this to Moscow \"trying to orchestrate conflict and provocation\", according to William Hague. His cynicism is matched by Obama's grotesque congratulations to the coup junta on its \"remarkable restraint\" following the Odessa massacre. Illegal and fascist-dominated, the junta is described by Obama as \"duly elected\". What matters is not truth, Henry Kissinger once said, but \"but what is perceived to be true.\" In the US media the Odessa atrocity has been played down as \"murky\" and a \"tragedy\" in which \"nationalists\" (neo-Nazis) attacked \"separatists\" (people collecting signatures for a referendum on a federal Ukraine). Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal damned the victims - \"Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels, Government Says\". Propaganda in Germany has been pure cold war, with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung warning its readers of Russia's \"undeclared war\". For Germans, it is an invidious irony that Putin is the only leader to condemn the rise of fascism in 21st-century Europe. A popular truism is that \"the world changed\" following 9/11. But what has changed? According to the great whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, a silent coup has taken place in Washington and rampant militarism now rules. The Pentagon currently runs \"special operations\" - secret wars - in 124 countries. At home, rising poverty and hemorrhaging liberty are the historic corollary of a perpetual war state. Add the risk of nuclear war, and the question begs: why do we tolerate this? This article first appeared in the Guardian, UK Follow John Pilger on twitter @johnpilger",
