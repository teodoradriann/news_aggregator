    "title": "Jail staffing questioned after violent attack on Hillsborough detention deputy by inmate | FOX 13 Tampa Bay",
    "text": "An inmate in the Hillsborough County jail could be locked up for decades after investigators said he attacked a detention deputy, leaving him with serious injuries.According to court documents, the deputy was questioning inside one of the jail&apos;s housing units and, when the deputy tried to place Fulton in handcuffs, \"the defendant pulled away and struck him in the face with a closed fist.\"The criminal report affidavit indicates the attack, which was recorded by the jail&apos;s security cameras, lasted about four minutes before another inmate was able to pull Fulton off the deputy.Following Fulton&apos;s pretrial detention hearing Thursday, which was continued until Monday, Hillsborough State Attorney Suzy Lopez said she wants Fulton to receive the maximum 30-year sentence.\"This is one of the most violent videos that I have ever seen. It absolutely turned my stomach when I saw it. It&apos;s horrific,\" Lopez said. \"He absolutely cannot be walking amongst us in our community. He deserves to be behind bars. I&apos;m not sure where the jail is going to put him because he&apos;s also shown that he can&apos;t be safe.\"Lopez said Fulton is an accused violent criminal out of Broward County who was arrested in Hillsborough for violating his probation. OTHER NEWS: Florida launches ‘Check My Contract’ portal to help storm victims avoid bad contracts The details of the attack in court documents left former corrections officers questioning how the fight lasted several minutes.\"I was shocked because four minutes is an eternity,\" said Joe Rojas, who is retired after spending 30 years as a corrections officer and federal union representative. \"It seems forever, just for a minute, let alone four minutes. It&apos;s ridiculous and that&apos;s scary. It&apos;s amazing that he survived. Thank God he survived.\"A sheriff&apos;s office spokesperson said the deputy&apos;s radio had been knocked away during the fight, so he couldn&apos;t immediately call for help. The response by deputies monitoring the security cameras is unclear.Rojas, meanwhile, wonders if this is an indication of staffing issues he said are plaguing corrections facilities nationwide.\"The staffing from the state to the city to the county, and we&apos;re all dealing with the same thing, it is incredibly low and dangerous,\" he said.During Fulton&apos;s hearing, the Hillsborough County Sheriff&apos;s Office asked the judge to prevent the media from viewing and recording video of the attack. That decision is expected to come next week. STAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 13 TAMPA:",

Ha parlato poco dopo che l’agenzia delle Nazioni Unite ha pubblicato un rapporto che invita Israele a ridurre la violenza, che ha provocato la morte di 291 palestinesi nella Cisgiordania occupata dal 7 ottobre.\nSecondo il rapporto, i coloni israeliani hanno ucciso otto di queste vittime, e un palestinese è stato ucciso dalle truppe israeliane o dai coloni.\n“Penso che sia estremamente importante sottolinearlo: dove c’è impunità le violazioni continueranno a verificarsi”, ha affermato.\nHa aggiunto: “Queste dichiarazioni [dei funzionari israeliani] incoraggiano i coloni, danno loro un senso di sicurezza, danno loro un certo tipo di permesso di fare ciò che vogliono”.\nArgomenti:\nNazioni Unite",

    "text": "Publicado:\n29 mar 2024 09:49 GMT\n«Todos tenemos pequeños fracasos, grandes fracasos», afirmó Francisco.\nEl papa Francisco realizó el «conmovedor» lavatorio de los pies en la tradicional ceremonia del Jueves Santo que en esta ocasión se celebró en una cárcel ubicada en las afueras de Roma, Italia, informa Vatican News.\nEl pontífice lavó y besó los pies de 12 mujeres encarceladas en la penitenciaría feminina de Rebibbia, donde varias de ellas no pudieron contener las lágrimas por el gesto de Francisco.\n«Jesús lo perdona todo. Jesús siempre perdona. Solo pide que pidamos perdón», afirmó el papa. «Todos tenemos pequeños fracasos, grandes fracasos. Cada uno tiene su propia historia. Pero el Señor nos espera siempre , con los brazos abiertos, y no se cansa de perdonar», agregó.\nEl lavatorio de pies conmemora el gesto de Jesúscristo , que en la Última Cena hizo lo mismo con sus discípulos. En la Biblia, la ceremonia es descrita como una muestra de humildad y servicio hacia los demás sin importar la posición en que uno se encuentre porque somos todos iguales.\nDesde 2013, cuando fue elegido papa, Francisco ha visitado varias prisiones. En el Jueves Santo de 2022 llegó a una cárcel de la ciudad italiana de Civitavecchia para lavar y besar los pies de 12 reclusos.\nEnlace fuente https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/504154-jesus-perdona-todo-papa-pies-12-mujeres-encarceladas?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all",

    "text": "In den vergangenen Jahren hat Amazon zahlreiche Services abgewertet oder eingestellt. Ungewollte Einschübe vermeidet man bei Amazon Music beispielsweise nur noch im Rahmen einer einzelnen Playlist, während Prime Video mittlerweile Werbung schaltet. Auch Amazons Streaming-Plattform Freevee musste weichen. Und selbiges gilt ab kommender Woche auch für einen weiteren Service, der in über 200 Ländern verfügbar war und nach Einschätzung von Amazon allein in der Europäischen Union knapp 45 Millionen aktive Nutzer verzeichnete.\nAmazon stellt App-Service ein\nAm 20. August schließt Amazon die Tore seines Appstores für Android-Nutzer. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt könne nicht mehr garantiert werden, dass Apps, die aus dem Amazon Appstore heruntergeladen wurden, weiterhin funktionieren. Und neue Apps werden sich verständlicherweise ebenfalls nicht mehr installieren lassen. Zumindest nicht über Android. Denn an auf anderen Geräten soll der Appstore weiterhin bestehen bleiben – allen voran auf Fire TV– und Fire-Tablet-Geräten.\nZu den Gründen äußerte sich Amazon bereits Anfang des Jahres: „Wir haben beschlossen, den Amazon Appstore für Android einzustellen, um unsere Bemühungen auf das Appstore-Erlebnis auf unseren eigenen Geräten zu konzentrieren, da dort derzeit die überwältigende Mehrheit unserer Kundinnen und Kunden damit interagiert“, hieß es vonseiten eines Sprechers.\nNutzer müssen handeln – oder eben nicht\nZeitgleich mit dem Amazon Appstore stellt der Händler auch sein Amazon Coins-Programm ein. Diese werden genutzt, um Einkäufe in bestimmten Apps sowie In-App-Käufe zu tätigen. Nun müssen Nutzer die Münzen jedoch bis zum 20. August verbrauchen. Es sei denn, sie wollen stattdessen ihr Geld zurück. Amazon zeigt sich hier nämlich einsichtig. So gab der Versandriese an, alle verbliebenen Coins, nach dem Stichtag zurückzuerstatten. Weitere Einzelheiten zur Erstattung wollte man dabei ursprünglich „zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt“ bekannt geben. Die dazugehörigen FAQ hat Amazon bisher jedoch nicht aktualisiert.\nÜber unsere Links\nMit diesen Symbolen kennzeichnen wir Partner-Links.
