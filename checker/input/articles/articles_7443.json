    "title": "Coach Bareman Reveals Israel Adesanya Will Never Overcome Sean Strickland Loss – “It Was Unexplainable”",
    "text": "Losses can weigh heavily on a fighter’s psyche, and\nIsrael Adesanya, the former middleweight champion, is a prime example of this. Adesanya, the man who once seemed invincible, suddenly finds himself on a losing streak. After two tough defeats, his coach, Eugene Bareman, recently spilled the beans on Izzy’s mental state.\nBareman decided to shed some light on the situation, appearing on a podcast with a name that is actually very memorable called “Who The Fook Is That Guy.” According to the coach, Adesanya’s loss to Dricus Du Plessis was easier to swallow than his defeat by\nSean Strickland.\n“He’s handling it well and you’re right, I love the way he loses. I actually prefer the way he loses than the way he wins…The Strickland loss, he will never get over. He just fought badly and just it was unexplainable…it’s not measurable like what caused it. You just go down a rabbit hole of a million things,” said Bareman.\nThe coach praised Du Plessis, calling his defense underrated. Adesanya was caught off guard and found himself tapping out to the submission. Bareman blamed fatigue for Izzy’s loss. But the Strickland loss? That’s the one that keeps Adesanya up at night, tossing and turning.\nBareman’s words paint a picture of a fighter grappling not just with opponents but with his own legacy. Israel Adesanya, once the undisputed middleweight king, now finds himself in unfamiliar territory, losing\nthree of his last four fights.\nCoach Eugene Bareman Reveals Israel Adesanya’s Comeback Date\nIsrael Adesanya has had a rough time lately. But his coach, Eugene Bareman, recently dropped some exciting news for fans. His recent loss to Du Plessis marked his second defeat in a row, and fans wondered\nwhether he would return to action soon.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral MMA stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nCoach Bareman dropped a bombshell in a recent interview. He hinted that Adesanya might return to the octagon before the year’s out. This might be a bit soon, but Adesanya is adamant about ending the year strong.\n“I would say that Izzy will fight again this year as well. It could be all on again, this year, it just doesn’t stop,” said Bareman via Combat TV.\nOf course, nothing’s set in stone yet. The\nUFC’s schedule is tight, and finding gaps that can adjust a fighter of Israel Adesnaya’s caliber is low. But the UFC usually makes its own way when there’s a potential pay-per-view draw.\nAlso Read:\nIsrael Adesanya Reacts As Alex Pereira Suspected Him Of Having Injury While Fighting Dricus Du Plessis At UFC 305 – “It’s Weird How This Guy Knows Me”",

    "title": "Clarksburg Teen Already Charged As Adult Facing New Charges For Second Maryland Shooting: PD",
    "text": "Clarksburg resident Jaiden Ochieng was first identified and charged following a shooting that was reported in March in the 19300 block of Archdale Road in Germantown. According to a spokesperson from the Montgomery County Police Department, at around 3 p.m. on Wednesday, March 13, Ochieng arrived at a bus stop in a stolen Hyundai, and when his would-be 15-year-old victim got off the bus, he got out of the vehicle and chased after the teen. During the pursuit, Ochieng pulled out a handgun and began shooting at the teen, who was uninjured. Ochieng then fled the scene. Investigators say they recovered two casings at the scene, and it was ultimately determined that Ochieng was the suspect involved in the incident, and a warrant was issued for his arrest, charging him with first-degree murder and other offenses. Last month, officers located Ochieng in the 13300 block of Copper Ridge Road in Germantown, and he was found be in possession of a loaded handgun that was reported stolen out of Clinton. Ochieng was initially charged as an adult with: - Attempted first-degree attempted murder; - First-degree assault; - Use of a firearm in the commission of a violent felony; - Possession of a firearm on school property; - Possession of a loaded handgun; - Underage possession of a firearm; - Related theft offenses. On Thursday, Oct. 24, authorities announced that the teen, still in custody, has been linked to a shooting in August on Crystal Rock Drive in Germantown. In the second incident, police say that on Thursday, Aug. 8, officers were called to the 19600 block of Crystal Rock Drive to investigate a shooting when Ochieng allegedly got out of a vehicle and fired shots at his victim, who was sitting on a park bench. In that case, the victim was able to run away and was uninjured. During the investigation into that shooting, it was determined a Honda used by Ochieng was stolen out of Clarksburg, and his weapon was reported stolen out of Prince George's County. Ochieng now faces additional charges, including attempted first-degree murder, motor vehicle theft, and multiple firearms-related offenses. He is being charged as an adult in both the March and August incidents and is currently being held without bond at the Montgomery County Central Processing Unit.

    "text": "Racing Victoria stewards have taken decisive action against mare Delicious Tycoon, suspending her for the entire racing season following a positive test for the banned steroid trendione. This case marks the second incident in Matt Laurie’s stable, following a similar issue with mare Anahita last September. Laurie, informed of Delicious Tycoon’s positive test, had previously attributed Anahita’s positive result to the seasonal medication Altrenogest. This theory is supported by a parallel case involving trainer Rebecca Waymouth and her mare Maliepo, where the same medication was identified as the likely source of a trendione positive. Confirming the prohibited substance in a blood sample from Delicious Tycoon taken on August 3 last year, Racing Victoria stewards have enforced a 12-month ban from racing, starting from the sample date. This means Delicious Tycoon, with three race wins and nearly $200,000 in earnings, is ineligible to race until at least August 3, 2024. Laurie’s statement highlighted the use of Altrenogest and its cessation on the day of Anahita’s positive result. The ongoing investigation seeks to clarify the circumstances surrounding these findings.",

    "text": "Une fuite de gaz détectée dans un des puits offshore au large du Sénégal et de la Mauritanie\nUne fuite de gaz a été détectée sur le projet Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) au large de la Mauritanie et du Sénégal. L'information est confirmée ce mercredi à RFI par l'entreprise BP, majoritaire dans le projet et l'une des entreprises en charge de l'exploitation du gaz. Une exploitation gazière qui, après plusieurs reports, avait finalement débuté fin décembre 2024.\nPublié le :\n« Des bulles de gaz sous-marines à faible débit » ont été détectées sur l'un des quatre puits d'extraction, dans le cadre des tests de mise en service, explique BP. Des équipements et du personnel spécialisés ont été mobilisés pour régler le problème, a également indiqué la major britannique, évitant soigneusement d'employer le terme de fuite.\nDans une communication sur les réseaux sociaux il y a quelques jours, le ministre mauritanien de l'Environnement déclare lui que l'incident a été découvert le 19 janvier et que les autorités des deux pays « mènent des investigations approfondies afin de gérer efficacement la situation et prévenir tout impact environnemental ».\nSur ce plan, BP se veut rassurant. « L'impact devrait être négligeable » insiste l'entreprise. « Des analyses techniques, une surveillance et des inspections visuelles sont en cours pour suivre la situation ». Cependant, déjà, les inquiétudes sont partagées dans la presse locale. Contacté, un expert du secteur souligne que ce genre d'incident est peu commun, mais peut arriver. Difficile cependant d'évaluer l'importance du problème sans savoir où est exactement localisée la fuite.\nBP précise par ailleurs que la production des autres puits n'est pas impactée pendant les réparations sans en préciser les échéances.\nLe début de l'exploitation était prévu pour 2022, repoussé encore à 2023 puis 2024 en raison de difficultés opérationnelles. Ces retards font l'objet d'audit pour en évaluer les surcoûts. La production de GTA devrait atteindre 2,5 millions de tonnes de gaz naturel liquéfié par an.\nÀ lire aussiGTA: le Sénégal et la Mauritanie font un pas vers l'exploitation de leur gisement de gaz commun\nNewsletterRecevez toute l'actualité internationale directement dans votre boite mail\nJe m'abonne",

I think that game against Crystal Palace is a good example that we need to go there, to Luton, and to think it is going to be really tough. The stadium, the fans, it is a team that loves to fight, loves to work really, really hard.\n\"It is so difficult if you watch the last few games at their stadium, it's always tough for all of the opponents. If we want to get a good result, we need to be ready to of course play football, but we need to match their desire, the capacity to fight in every single goal. It's going to be a good test for us. It's the challenge to be consistent. For us now, it's to go there and first of all to fight, be clever, be focused and then try to win the game.\"\nPochettino added on Kenilworth Road, Luton's stadium: \"Yes, because I am an old man, I am romantic. I love the football of the past and this type of stadium makes you remember when I start to play, you know, the old Wembley. A stadium that smells different.\n\"They're maybe not luxury in the way that we recognise luxury today but these types of stadiums, I think you love to be there because of its history. They are completely different. Today we are living with a million dollar stadium but if you go there and you feel the real football.\" Video of the day:\nAbout the author Paul Vegas",
