    "title": "'Come prepared': Drivers urge caution as snowy conditions create problems on Interstate 80",
    "text": "PLACER COUNTY, Calif. — [Stormy conditions](/weather/) on Interstate 80 are causing havoc for drivers who had to sit in traffic for hours after a big rig crash.\nIt started around 1:30 p.m. when traffic was held on westbound I-80 after the crash at Whitmore. Several drivers pulled over at the Nyack exit instead of sitting in the standstill traffic.\n“I was on my way back up to San Francisco for my office holiday party,” said Tom Gump, who was driving from Tahoe. “In a world of back to office, it was going to be a great time to get together and enjoy the holiday season. I cannot believe that we're stuck here not knowing how long it's going to continue and before we're able to go again.”\nGump says it’s not the first time something like that’s happened to him. He was stuck at the same location for about 16 hours four years ago.\n“A big rig that was carrying milk jackknifed (and) dumped all of its milk on the ground and they were treating it as hazardous material that needed to be cleaned up, so I'm cautiously optimistic we're not going to be here 16 hours today,” Gump told [ABC10](/).\n[Caltrans](https://dot.ca.gov/) is expecting the weather to take a break during the day Friday, but snowy conditions could pick up Friday night going into Saturday, and that’s when people could see more accidents or spinouts, so they want drivers to be ready for delays.\n“Just be prepared. You know, pack chains, even if four-wheel drive/all-wheel drive. We recommend that you pack chains just in case and then bring blankets with you. Bring flashlights, make sure your phone is charged. Make sure your gas tank’s full,” said John O’Connell with Caltrans.\nAs a safety precaution, semitruck drivers like Jason Dennis also want people to look out for them when they must chain up.\n“My biggest concern is the cars drive by, and they don't pay attention to the truck drivers, and they come close to hitting us every time we're putting chains on,” said Dennis.\nEarlier Thursday, some drivers were caught off guard by the snow going up the mountain, but they plan to make the most of it. Still, they recommend others check the conditions before hitting the Sierra this weekend.\n“Just slow down, be careful. (It) makes me nervous with the kids,” said Melody Burns.\nCaltrans says anyone coming through the area should check the [QuickMap website](https://quickmap.dot.ca.gov/) or app. It has the latest on chain controls, access to traffic cameras and information about lane closings.\n“Come prepared. Just because you think it may not be, it might be,” said Thomas Burns.",

    "title": "From Ukraine to Knoxville: UT violinist who fled war will soon cross graduation stage",
    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — From Ukraine to Knoxville — the sound of a violin followed Marki Lukyniuk wherever he went. He arrived in Knoxville as a refugee, after Russia invaded Ukraine and began around two years of intense fighting. That never stopped him from playing violin, though, and he brought his music across the world. \"Violin is just something that I've been playing since I can remember myself,\" he said. \"It's been to Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Poland, gosh, in the U.S.\" He is only 23 years old but captivated the hearts of East Tennesseans during his performances. He performed at hundreds of events and produced his own music, making his mark on Rocky Top through creativity and talent. \"I showed people something that they never saw before, and never heard before,\" he said. \"It's a part of me.\" He said he started playing when he was around 5 years old, and the instrument eventually helped him find a one-way ticket to the U.S. He arrived in 2022 after fleeing the war, hoping to continue his education. \"I knew that it's not safe to stay in my country, and I wanted to finish my bachelor's degree. I wanted to pursue music,\" he said. He has performed at benefit concerts, raising money to support Ukraine. Despite being so far away from home, he embraced his roots. \"To show people how beautiful Ukraine is, and how much talent we have,\" he said. \"I would like to thank everybody who kept supporting me, I'm going to miss you guys.\" He said after graduating from the University of Tennessee's School of Music, he plans to attend the University of Miami as he pursues a master's degree. Spring commencement will start on May 16, when students will start walking across the stage claiming their degrees. It will go through May 20 and will take place in the Food City Center.",

According to reports, he was bitten by a dog he rescued three months back from a drain.\nHe, however, ignored that bite and did not go for a rabies vaccination, thinking that it was a minor injury, which later troubled him and caused his death.\nHis coach, Praveen Kumar, told, “Brijesh mistook the pain in his arm for a regular kabaddi injury. The bite seemed minor and he didn’t think it was serious, so he didn’t take the vaccine,\" as reported by the Times of India.\nBrijesh complained of numbness during a practice session last week and was taken to a district hospital, but his condition worsened, and he was transferred to a private hospital in Noida.\nA few videos before his death show Brijesh in severe pain, and in one clip, he is seen enduring a violent rabies attack.\nSandeep Kumar, his brother, claimed that Brijesh was denied treatment at multiple government hospitals.\n“All of a sudden, he was afraid of water and was showing symptoms of rabies, but we were denied treatment at the government hospitals in Khurja, Aligarh, and even Delhi. It was only in Noida that doctors confirmed he was likely infected with rabies. Brijesh died on Saturday while we were taking him to a faith healer in Mathura,\" he told TOI.\nBrijesh was a resident of Farana village in Bulandshahr. The entire village assembled to bid a final farewell to the beloved kabaddi player.",

    "text": "PLATTSBURGH — Today, Christians observe Good Friday also known as Great Friday, Holy Friday and Black Friday, which commemorates Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and death at Calvary, whose exact location is not known outside of Jerusalem.\nBelow Diocese of Ogdensburg Most Reverend Bishop Terry R. LaValley shares his message for Easter 2024.\n“I am the resurrection and the life, the one who believes in me, though he or she die, yet shall they live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.”\nDear Sisters and Brothers in Christ:\nYes, the Lord has risen! Satan did all he could to break down the love, courage, and fidelity of our Savior. Evil unleashed its arsenal of hatred, injustice, humiliation, and pain. Evil fought a bloody fight, but the Son of God rose victorious. That means absolutely everything for you and me!\nThe resurrection is the sacred stamp that validates everything Jesus did and said: His claim to be God’s Son; His insistence of authority to forgive sin; His universal call to abandon self- centeredness for love of God and neighbor as the path to true happiness and everlasting peace; and His promise to send the Holy Spirit for guidance to His Mystical Body, our Church.\nJesus was not one more person who finished last, one more dreamer whose dreams were squelched by the harsh reality of life on this earth. Jesus Christ has risen! Jesus’ victory over evil and lies; over injustice and suffering is total and irreversible. In the face of over twenty centuries filled with a steady stream of saints, no reasonable person can deny it.\nLet there be no mistake. Evil still wanders about. However, we remain ever vigilant and grateful for the gifts of the Spirit on our earthly journeys. We share this Good News and express our resurrection joy, even amid today’s trials and tribulation. Christ’s victory over sin and death causes us to always be hope-filled pilgrims of faith because we are Christ-led and Christ-fed.\nAlleluia! Blessed Easter to you and your loved ones! Alleluia!\nFaithfully yours in Christ,\nMost Reverend Terry R. LaValley\nBishop of Ogdensburg",
