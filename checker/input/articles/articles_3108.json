    "text": "For years, several workers hired on contract have been waiting for permanent jobs and better wages at the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB).\nThe CMWSSB Labourers’ Union will hold a conference in the city to emphasise key demands. Nearly 2,850 labourers had been hired for sewer and water network maintenance, but most of them are without permanent jobs despite working for several years.\nG. Beem Rao, former Maduravoyal MLA and the Union’s president, said though some of the basic demands, including safety gears and uniforms, have been met, the workers continue to struggle for secure jobs and better wages. “A separate category must be formed for skilled labourers with a hike in monthly salary fixed at a minimum of ₹26,000,” he said.\n’M.Palani, the Union’s general secretary, said labourers have been fighting for secure jobs and hike in wages for eight years now. “The workers who have been engaged on contract for over three years must be provided permanent jobs. We staged several protests in the past. But promises are yet to be fulfilled,” he said.\nA resolution would also be passed in support of the ongoing protest of Greater Chennai Corporation’s sanitation workers.\nPublished - August 10, 2025 01:05 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "title": "Should parents buy school supplies for the entire class? TikTok is divided",
    "text": "“Communal” school supply lists are rattling parents on TikTok, with some asking, “Why should I buy scissors and highlighters for other children?”\nFor many families, back-to-school shopping includes notebooks, markers and folders, not just for their kids but for their peers as well. While certain states require schools to provide basic supplies, classroom budgets are tight. To ensure that all children have enough supplies — we’ve seen how kids treat pencils, right? — teachers often have two options: pay for a portion of supplies themselves, usually without reimbursement , or create “wish lists” requesting families to contribute bulk items once or twice a year.\nIf you’re asked to buy two dozen glue sticks, it’s either because teachers expect your child to use every single one this year or they benefit students whose families can’t afford to buy supplies. Extras are also handy when items go missing or break. Teachers may ask parents to buy specific brands or basic, nondescript supplies without branding or flourishes. Sometimes teachers request bigger items, too, like whiteboard markers, disinfecting wipes and tissues.\nEach teacher has their own system but most agree that no one wants to snatch Billy’s favorite Spider-Man eraser and give it to his mortal enemy. While specific guidelines vary by classroom, the purpose of general supplies is that they all look the same and are there for the taking as needed.\nSome parents contribute, others cannot. And some have complicated feelings about the responsibility.\nOne mom on TikTok wrote, “I spent upwards of $400 on school stuff for seven kids a year. I am not buying for a whole class” while another simply said, “Some parents don’t like to share apparently.”\nFrances Chie, a mom in Ohio, wants to buy personalized supplies for her 3-year-old daughter who is entering preschool this year, but not necessarily her peers. While their school only asks families to buy supplies for their own children, Chie suspects that communal supplies are in her future.\n“If my baby wants Disney Princess pencils, a pencil case (and) erasers and I go and buy them, why wouldn’t she be using them?” Chie said in a TikTok video.\n@lovefranceschiee What are your thoughts? 🤔 | #schoolsupplies #backtoschool #momsoftiktok #greenscreen\n♬ original sound – Love Frances Chie 💕 Parents and teachers responded:\n“I will label each crayon individually with my child’s name, a whole 128 pack. I don’t care.” “What I buy for my children is THEIRS. And I will be telling their teachers the same.” “As a teacher, I understand this but also, we have to pay for so much of it.” “First grade teacher here. The only supplies I use as community supplies are pencils and glue sticks, only because they need help managing supplies at this age. They will need 24 pencils, just not on Day One.” “I don’t think most parents understand how much little kids lose or break pencils and crayons.” “Teachers have to handle 18 to 25 children. Please just do whatever your teacher wants you to do.” Chie tells TODAY.com that she and her daughter are excited to find supplies branded with Disney, Bluey and unicorns.\n“If parents are going school shopping with their little ones, and picking out things that (reflect) their special interests … those kids should use those supplies,” she says.\nChie says she was surprised to learn that many teachers pay for classroom decorations and supplies with their own money and she would be happy to donate more communal items, like paper towels, hand sanitizer and tissues to the classroom, but draws the line at more personal items.\nSarah Spikeston, a Texas mom and community college professor, is in favor of communal school supplies. (@sarahspikeston via TikTok) Sarah Spikeston of Texas pays a flat fee to her daughter’s private school to purchase communal supplies while her son’s private Montessori preschool allows for both personal and shared items.\n“As someone who was chronically poor growing up and homeless for parts of (my youth), meeting the needs of all kids, regardless of their circumstances, is really important to me,” Spikeston, a community college professor in Texas, tells TODAY.com via email.\nShe adds: “I know what it’s like to be the kid that’s left without and that classrooms run more efficiently when they are fully stocked and there’s some level of uniformity in supplies.”\nSpikeston says some parents dislike buying generic brands but kids don’t care about sharing supplies, especially when they’re expressing their individuality elsewhere.\n“We have to remember that any of us could begin to struggle in the blink of an eye,” says Spikeston. “Those of us that are blessed to be able to afford school supplies have a duty to the community because the community in turn funds our public schools.”\nTodd Bloch, a middle school science teacher in Michigan, understands that supplies are expensive and that families may have brand favorites or want to label their children’s supplies.\nSupply lists are a “balancing act” for teachers, too.\n“It’s difficult to know exactly what we need going into the school year, especially when store sales usually happen in June,” Bloch tells TODAY.com.\nWhen parents can afford to buy supplies, says Bloch, it saves teachers from diving into their classroom budgets so they can spend that money elsewhere — like baking soda and vinegar to demonstrate chemical reactions with a “cool” fizz, he says.\nWith experience, Bloch has fine-tuned his supply list: kids trace perfect circles using cheap paper coffee cups instead of compasses, technological information can be stored in the cloud versus flash drives, and standard pencils trump refillable mechanical tools. When Bloch’s students built solar ovens with aluminum foil and cardboard, they brought in their family’s used pizza boxes. It helps that Bloch’s school reimburses him a portion of what he spends. If Bloch wants to do something special, like reward his students with Jolly Ranchers, he pays out of his own pocket.\nBloch communicates his recommendations for supplies to parents and reassures students they will be fully prepared, one way or another.\n“Teachers just want to create an equitable experience for students,” says Bloch. “If parents can’t help make that happen, most teachers totally understand.”\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com .

    "text": "La ola de calor que está a punto de llegar a España, incluido a Castilla y León, hace que los únicos planes que apetezcan sean aquellos en los que el agua es el principal protagonista.\nEn estas fechas en las que el calor aprieta y con fuerza, hay quienes optan por la playa. Otros se decantan por la piscina y luego están los que, por unos motivos u otros, eligen parajes naturales únicos y excepcionales que te harán sentir como si estuvieras en una zona de costa, pero con unas vistas aún más impresionantes.\nUno de estos entornos se halla en la provincia de Segovia, concretamente, entre las localidades de San Miguel de Bernuy y Fuentidueña, en el paraje La Serranilla.\nAllí se ubica el embalse de Las Vencías, también conocido como playa de Las Vencías, un lugar rodeado de naturaleza y ubicado en la ribera del río Duratón, en el que es posible, relajarse, disfrutar y desconectar al mismo tiempo.\nY es que, a dicho embalse se trasladan cada fin de semana y durante la temporada estival, cientos de familias y grupos de amigos para realizar actividades acuáticas, refrescarse, tomar el sol y hasta para divertirse en alguno de sus chiringuitos, siendo el Lago Bar La Serranilla uno de los más conocidos.\nImagen de la playa de Las Vencías y la terraza de uno de sus chiringuitos Lago Bar La Serranilla\nEn él suelen celebrarse todo tipo de fiestas, actuaciones en directo y, además, se pueden alquilar kayaks, piraguas, canoas, tablas de pádel surf y hasta hidropedales. Del mismo modo, cuenta con todo tipo de bebidas y servicio de comidas, para que todos los interesados puedan disfrutar de una estupenda y deliciosa experiencia culinaria a orillas del Duratón. Allí se puede comprar un bocadillo, como encargar las mejores paellas.\nLas Vencías, un embalse que, aunque fue construido con fines hidroeléctricos, hoy funciona como zona de ocio, también cuenta con hamacas y sombrillas, un agua limpia y cristalina y, como no podía ser de otra manera, con una amplia y extensa zona de arena fina. Tanto, que a pesar de que no es poca la gente que frecuenta el pantano, casi nunca se ve masificado.\nAllí también se pueden observar infinidad de buitres que sobrevuelan la zona y una vegetación de ribera que hacen de este espacio un entorno único y excepcional, así como todo un reclamo turístico, ya no solo para los segovianos que se pasan por allí cada fin de semana de verano, sino también para madrileños y castellanos y leoneses que, por lo general, se muestran encantados con este plan. Además, cabe destacar que es un lugar ideal para pescar.\nA todo ello se suma que aquellos que deciden recorrer el embalse, ya sea en canoa, kayak, piragua o hidropedal, pueden contemplar un sinfín de atractivos naturales y arquitectónicos, muchos de ellos acuáticos, que van desde meandros hasta acantilados e incluso ruinas románicas.\nEn definitiva, un maravilloso paraje donde todo, o casi todo, es posible. Es como ir a la playa sin tener que realizar un desplazamiento largo y encima en un lugar con un paisaje de postal. ¿Te lo vas a perder?",

    "text": "¿Crisis en La Bella Luz? Seis cantantes renuncian en menos de un año, algunos por su salud mental\nEl grupo musical La Bella Luz enfrenta una serie de salidas de sus integrantes, desde marzo de 2024 hasta febrero de este 2025. La situación ha generado preocupación entre los fanáticos, debido a que varios artistas explicaron que decidieron irse para priorizar su bienestar emocional.\nEl 23 de febrero de 2024, el empresario Óscar Custodio presentó con gran entusiasmo a su nueva delantera de La Bella Luz, tras la inminente salida de Milagros Díaz. En aquel entonces, celebró la incorporación de las voces de Naldy Saldaña, Alejandra Guerrero, Deyvis Paredes, Hanna Delgado, Kevin Céspedes y Eduardo Ortúzar. Incluso, Briela Cirilo iba a ser la séptima integrante, pero terminó volviendo a Corazón Serrano por una mejor oferta económica.\nSemanas más tarde, el grupo se fortaleció con la llegada de Claudia Salazar, Alexandra Seijas y Mathías Zevallos, quienes resultaron ganadores del casting que se realizó en el programa ‘Mande quien mande’, cuya final fue el 19 de marzo de 2024. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha ninguno de ellos permanece en la orquesta. De hecho, algunos afirmaron que tomaron la decisión de irse para preservar su paz mental.\nMathias Zevallos, Ale Seijas y Claudia Salazar, ganadores del casting en 'MQM', se fueron de La Bella Luz.

Solo agradecieron a la joven por haberlos apoyado en tan corto tiempo. “Ella tiene que continuar con sus actividades personales, le deseamos muchos éxitos”, expresaron en sus redes oficiales.\nDías después, la cantante chiclayana explicó en un live por TikTok que su salida fue por mutuo acuerdo entre la orquesta y su parte. Asimismo, lamentó que no haya podido despedirse de sus compañeros y se mostró agradecida por la oportunidad.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Fue eliminado por Christian Yaipén en ‘La voz Kids’, pero ahora brilla con La Bella Luz: conoce la historia de Stiven Franco]\nKevin Cespedes le dijo adiós a La Bella Luz\nEl segundo cantante de La Bella Luz en irse en el 2024 fue Kevin Cespedes, quien hizo pública su salida a través de un comunicado de prensa. Según dijo, fue por motivos personales. “Espero poder seguir contando con su apoyo en futuros proyectos musicales. A todos mis compañeros musicales, les deseo muchas bendiciones y éxitos en todo”, concluyó.\nAunque ni la orquesta ni el cantante revelaron el verdadero motivo de su salida de La Bella Luz, algunos expertos en cumbia aseguraron que el intérprete estaba incómodo porque no le daban temas a grabar, tal y como sí pasó con los ganadores del casting.\nAle Seijas dejó La Bella Luz por “motivos forzados”\nEl 7 de agosto de 2024, la cantante Alexandra Seijas sorprendió a sus miles de fanáticos al compartir un comunicado sobre su salida de la orquesta. “Anuncio que dejo de pertenecer a La Bella Luz, dejando en claro mi renuncia, por motivos forzados. Muchas gracias a todo el público que siempre me ha apoyado en todo momento. Y espero seguir contando con el apoyo de todos ustedes”, indicó.\nEl comunicado de Ale Seijas disparó las alarmas de que algo estaba sucediendo en la agrupación, pero nadie aclaró nada. Después de su renuncia, la joven intentó hacer una carrera como solista. Incluso, expresó sus deseos de formar parte de Corazón Serrano, pero Edwin Guerro dijo que no contratará a nadie que haya estado en La Bella Luz para evitar problemas con la competencia. Finalmente, la joven fue fichada por Son del Duke, tras la salida de Cielo Fernández, la última contratación de Corazón Serrano.\nClaudia Salazar se fue de La Bella Luz por su paz mental\nClaudia Salazar, reconocida por su dedicación y entusiasmo en La Bella Luz, anunció su salida de La Bella Luz el 1 de enero de este 2025, a través de un comunicado, donde explicó que esta decisión responde a la necesidad de priorizar su tranquilidad. “He decidido dejar este proyecto musical, una decisión difícil, pero necesaria para priorizar mi bienestar y paz mental”, indicó en su mensaje compartido en Instagram.\nAdemás, la cantante expresó su agradecimiento a sus seguidores, quienes han sido un pilar fundamental en su carrera, brindándole inspiración constante a través de sus mensajes y aplausos. “Agradezco profundamente a todos mis fans por su apoyo, que ha sido una fuente infinita de inspiración. A pesar de que cierro este capítulo, espero seguir contando con su compañía en los nuevos caminos musicales que me esperan”, concluyó Salazar, quien en la actualidad se desempeña como cantante de Papillón.\nMathias Zevallos, la joven promesa de la cumbia, se fue de La Bella Luz\nCuando todo parecía que se había calmado en la interna de La Bella Luz, incluso se habían reforzado con el ingreso de Stiven Franco, el cantante Mathias Zevallos sorprendió a más de uno al anunciar su retiro de La Bella Luz, a pesar de que se había convertido en una de las principales voces de la orquesta.\n“Quiero hacer público mi retiro de la orquesta La Bella Luz. Agradezco al Sr. Oscar Custodio por la oportunidad brindada, ya que formar parte de la agrupación ha sido una experiencia que ha contribuido significativamente a mi crecimiento artístico. Asimismo, quiero expresar mi más profundo cariño a mis fans que han seguido mi trayectoria y han apoyado mi carrera musical”, expresó en sus redes.\nEduardo Ortúzar fue el último en irse de La Bella Luz\nUn día después del comunicado de Mathías Zevallos, el cantante Eduardo Ortúzar también anunció su renuncia a La Bella Luz. El intérprete de cumbia indicó que fue su decisión salir de la delantera del grupo, con el fin de “priorizar mi estabilidad emocional”. Asimismo, agradeció al señor Oscar Custodio por la oportunidad y sostuvo que está abierto a nuevas oportunidades de trabajo.",

    "text": "Uncomfortable weather is showing no sign of letting up for a Sydney to Hobart fleet already battered by squally conditions that have damaged yachts and broken ribs.\nMore than 70 boats remained at sea late on Friday afternoon, with the day's first finisher not arriving until 1pm (AEDT) - some 29 hours after LawConnect claimed line honours victory.\nTasmanian yacht Alive, which finished on Thursday, is primed to take out overall honours for a second occasion with a time that appears unbeatable.\nOfficial confirmation is likely to occur on Saturday.\nNo Limit and 12-year-old luxury cruiser Whisper were among a handful of yachts to make it to the safety of Hobart's Constitution Dock on Friday afternoon.\n\"Tough ... wet, lumpy, plenty of wind. But the team did an amazing job,\" No Limit skipper David Gotze said after his seventh-place finish across the line.\n\"We did the best with what we could do in the circumstances.\"\nThe retirement tally stands at 16 from 103 starters following a stormy Boxing Day night at sea.\nA strong wind warning is in place for waters off Tasmania's east coast, where a chunk of the fleet is tracking south.\nCruising Yacht Club of Australia commodore Arthur Lane said winds of 35 knots and 4.5-metre seas were expected on Friday afternoon and night.\n\"It is certainly slower than the last few years and that is because of the wind. It is an uphill race,\" he told AAP.\n\"It's going to be a very uncomfortable night.\"\nNSW entrant Salt Lines, veteran of 22 Sydney to Hobart races, and 52-footer Gunshot pulled the pin on Thursday night because of damage to their sails.\nRobbie Fisher, skipper of 66-footer Helsal 3, reported a broken mainsail rope, torn sail and \"other little things\".\n\"We have a minor injury to a crew ... our navigator was on deck, slipped, and cracked a couple of ribs,\" he said.\n\"We copped a beating across (Bass) Strait. We had over 30 knots and it was pretty bad. We have persevered though.\"\nHong Kong entrant Antipodes, crewed by Lindsay May in his 50th race, was slated to finish at some point on Friday.\n\"We've had some down time ... with breeze holes that our competitors didn't get,\" crew member Brad Kellett said.\n\"We've got a tear in the new mainsail to repair. We blew out our J2 headsail.\"\nThe Darren Hine-skippered Alive, overall winner in 2018, finished as clubhouse leader on handicap time.\nThe overall winner, which is awarded the Tattersall Cup, is judged on handicap which takes into account factors including the size of the boat.\nLawConnect won line honours on Thursday morning, coming from behind to beat fellow 100-footer and 2022 winner Andoo Comanche by just 51 seconds in the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history.\n ",

    "text": "Ashley Jones, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith\n‘Teen Mom’ Star Ashley Jones’ Estranged Husband, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith, Held Her Hostage & Threatened To Break Her Jaw Before Arrest Scary details have surfaced on Bariki “Bar” Smith’s recent arrest.\nAs previously reported, in July news broke that the MTV reality TV dad was arrested in Henderson, Nevada on second-degree kidnapping, coercion with threat of or use of physical force, contempt of municipal court, and harassment charges. At the time of the initial reports, full details on what occurred, including Bar Smith’s alleged victim, were limited. However, some speculated his estranged wife, Teen Mom: The Next Chapter star Ashley Jones , was on the receiving end of the 27-year-old’s attack.\nAshley Jones\nThe recently obtained police report has confirmed those whispers. The crazy incident reportedly started on July 6, after Ashley Jones , 27, posted a now-removed picture of herself with her new boyfriend to her Instagram Story. It’s said that an enraged Bar Smith contacted the mother of his 7-year-old daughter and warned her he was making the drive across state lines from California to her Nevada home.\nThe following day, before walking into her apartment, she reportedly called her mother over concerns her ex broke in. Her mom shared with authorities that while on the phone with her daughter she heard a man’s voice in the background say, “Hello, baby momma” before the call disconnected.\nAshley Jones and her mom\nHer mother immediately called 911 and made her way to Ashley Jones’ home. Per the police report, once officers were able to get Ashley safely to the front door she was “scared,” “crying, shaking, and very emotional.”\nReportedly, Bar has been “harassing and stalking Ashley for years.” After he was arrested she shared with police that he was “waiting for her on her couch,” and quickly took “her phone [and] all her electronics.” She also said he barricaded the doors using two kitchen barstools and said, “If you’re not leaving with me, you’re not leaving, period.”\nBariki ‘Bar’ Smith\nAllegedly, he claimed he’d give the items back only if she would take him to her boyfriend’s house. When she refused he reportedly told her,\n“Say something again, and I will break your f***ing jaw.”\nA threat Ashley believed “due to [Bar’s] violent past with her.”\nBar is currently behind bars on a $35,000 bail. Ashley officially filed for divorce on August 1, noting Bar’s recent attack against her in the filing. She requested sole custody of their daughter.\nAshley Jones, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith, and their daughter\nWhat are your thoughts on this entire situation? Tell us in the comments below!\n[ VIA ]",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | East Anglian Daily Times",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",
