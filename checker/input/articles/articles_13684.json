    "text": "El mediocampista antioqueño Richard Ríos es reconocido por sus recientes actuaciones con la selección Colombia y por la carrera que está forjando en el fútbol de Brasil, donde fue campeón hace un par de semanas con el Palmeiras. También es popular en redes sociales, sobre todo en TikTok, por los bailes con los que celebra sus goles, a ritmo de funk brasileño.Entrando na trend de vídeos do Richard Ríos #TikTokEsportes #PalmeirasEn una reciente dinámica de preguntas y respuestas rápidas en TikTok, Richard Ríos confesó cuál es la mujer que considera la más linda de Colombia y dejó abierto el interrogante sobre su situación sentimental.\"¿Soltero, casado, viudo o comprometido?\", le preguntaron al futbolista de 23 años, a los que él respondió entre risas: \"paso\".Enseguida le lanzaron: \"¿Mujer más linda de Colombia?\", y Ríos no dudó en confesar su admiración por la belleza de la 'influencer' barranquillera Andrea Valdiri, quien el pasado 23 de noviembre anunció su separación del también creador de contenido Felipe Saruma tras un año y medio de matrimonio.Richard Ríos Montoya nació el 2 de junio del 2000 . Hoy, con 23 años, acumula cuatro equipos en su carrera profesional. Debutó en 2020 con el Flamengo , para luego ir cedido al Mazatlán de México. En septiembre de 2021 sufrió una lesión de rodilla que lo apartó de las canchas hasta abril de 2022, lo que llevó al equipo manito a no hacer eso de la opción de compra.Ríos rescindió contrato con Flamengo y firmó con el Guaraní del Paraguay, donde comenzó a darse a conocer, convirtiéndose en pieza clave del equipo Bugre.Esas buenas actuaciones llamaron la atención del Palmeiras, que lo terminó contratando en marzo de este año. Con ‘el Verdao’, Ríos acumula este año 1.585 minutos en 36 partidos jugados, anotando tres goles.Juega de mediocampista interior . Es un jugador de muy buena técnica, que sabe asociarse y que brinda equilibrio.Lo curioso de su historia de vida es que comenzó jugando al fútbol sala , deporte en el que alcanzó a jugar un Sudamericano sub-20 en Brasil (en 2018). Ese campeonato le cambió la vida, porque fue tan bueno su trabajo que el Flamengo le pidió probarse con su equipo juvenil. Pasaron un par de meses y Ríos fue escogido para quedarse en las filas del ‘Fla’, perfilado para surgir al primer equipo, algo que finalmente sucedió en la temporada 2020, cuando estaba latente la pandemia del COVID 19.",

    "title": "Leesburg, Virginia courthouse named after Howard University dean is National Historic Site",
    "text": "LEESBURG, Va. — The Charles Hamilton Houston courthouse in Leesburg, Virginia, where a Howard University dean fought to put an end to all-white juries has been named one of the National Park Service's newest National Historic Sites.\nBetween 1933 and 1934, Houston enlisted an all-Black team of NAACP lawyers to represent George Crawford in that courthouse, a man who had been accused of murdering two white women in Middleburg, Va.\nGeorge Crawford like many Black men during this period had been unlikely to face a fair trial. Although he was convicted for murder, legal professors[ have said](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/the-man-who-killed-jim-crow-the-legacy-of-charles-hamilton-houston/) Houston's efforts likely kept the man off death row, while also bringing national attention to the case.\nDavid Bradley, a now retired journalist living in Sterling, Va., wrote the 2014 book \"The Historic Murder Trial of George Crawford.\" Bradley told WUSA9 he believes the designation reflects a long-awaited reckoning with Northern Virginia's past.\n\"It's overdue. I'm really glad that it's been done and I would commend the Loudoun County government for getting that done,\" Bradley said. \"When I wrote the book there were monuments to confederate soldiers outside the courthouse, so clearly a lot of changes have been made in a short period of time.\"\nThis moment in history has an official place in the roster of National Historic Sites after a nomination by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland.\nThis designation comes a year after the the county voted to rename the courthouse after Houston.\nBradley said he believes the biggest milestone of the case was prosecuting the case against all-white juries with an all-Black team of lawyers.\nThe National Park Service also acknowledged this feat.\n\"Houston ... facilitated widespread recognition of the abilities of Black lawyers and laid the groundwork in the NAACP's campaign to use federal constitutional law to dismantle racial segregation,\" National Park Service said.\nThe courthouse was built in 1894 but looks relatively similar to how it appeared in the 1930s, when Houston prosecuted his case alongside NAACP lawyers.\nThe courthouse is located in the Loudoun County Courthouse Complex near the corner of King and Market Streets.\nThe National Historic Site label gives properties tax credits, access to grants and preservation assistance. There are more than 2,600 NHLs in the United States.\nCharles Hamilton Houston died in 1950, more than a decade before Black Americans were able to exercise voting rights and before Jim Crow segregation ended in the United States. Still, Houston was given the nickname, \"The Man who Killed Jim Crow\" for the case's significance as a step toward racial justice and equality.\nThree other D.C. and Virginia locations were also named National Historic Sites earlier this month:\nWashington, D.C.:\n- Furies Collective in Northeast\n- Slowe-Burrill House in Brookland\nVirginia:\n- Azurest South on Virginia State University's campus in Ettrick",

    "title": "South Africa bishops push back against Chief Rabbi who slammed Pope over Hamas",
    "text": "YAOUNDÈ, Cameroon – After the Chief Rabbi of South Africa posted a social media video accusing Pope Francis of “colluding with the forces of evil” for his stance on the war between Israel and Hamas, the country’s bishops have pushed back, insisting the claims “lack truth and objectivity and have an air of mistrust and character assassination.”\nThe bishops also asserted that while both the Holocaust and the surprise Hamas attacks on Israel of Oct. 7 were “barbaric” and must be prevented from happening again, “these events should not be used to silence and paralyze friends from being critical of the Israeli Army’s inhumane and unlawful acts in this present war.”\nChief Rabbi Warren Goldstein posted the video on YouTube Dec. 19, responding to a late November report in the Washington Post regarding a phone conversation between Pope Francis and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in which the pontiff allegedly said “it is forbidden to respond to terror with terror.”\nGoldstein said the pope’s remarks meant he was placing Israel on the same level as Hamas.\n“In comparing Israel’s just war of self-defense to the barbarism of Hamas, Pope Francis repeats the sins of Pope Pius XII from the Nazi era of surreptitiously supporting the forces of evil who seek to annihilate the Jewish people and betrays his fiduciary duty as the head of the Catholic Church to protect Christians throughout the world from the same murderous hatred directed against the Jews, not realizing that we are in this war together,” Goldstein said in the video.\nHe accused the pope of what he described as “primitive pacifism,” and suggested that the pontiff’s position could actually lead to more suffering.\n“Pope Francis, God has given you an historic opportunity to atone for the sins of Pope Pius and the Catholic Church during the Holocaust,” Goldstein said. “Your church and predecessor stood by while the first Holocaust was perpetrated, and now there are forces that seek a second holocaust.”\n“Yet you have never used your powerful moral voice to condemn Iran for all of this,” Goldstein said. “You have never publicly opposed Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, which we all know it intends to use to exterminate Israel. Pope Francis… you must not stand by as a passive bystander like Pope Pius did during the first holocaust, while Iran seeks to perpetrate a second one and one of the ways that Iran seeks to exterminate Israel is through its proxy army, Hamas.”\nAs of this writing, the video had drawn 116,000 views. In response, the Southern Africa Catholic Bishops Conference\nIn response, the Southern African Catholic Bishops published a Dec. 23 open letter signed by Bishop Sithembele Anton Sipuka of Umtata, South Africa, president of the conference, in which the bishops emphasized both the long-standing relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people, and Pope Francis’s own personal commitment to dialogue and cooperation.\n“Given the renewed religious dialogue with the Jewish people and the diplomatic relationship that exists between the Catholic Church and the State of Israel, your public attack on the pope is regrettable,” the bishops’ statement said.\n“The emotions with which you uttered these statements suggest that you believe that the Pope hates Jews, hence you call him to repent, [but] nothing could be further from the truth. Pope Francis began his papacy by visiting Israel in 2014. During that journey, he expressed joy about Catholics and Jews being ‘bound by a very special spiritual bond,’ pledging to work to advance ‘the progress there has been in relations between Jews and Catholics since the Second Vatican Council in a spirit of renewed collaboration,’” they said.\nThe SACBC defended the Pope’s stance on the war in Gaza, saying that he was not condoning terrorism but condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by Israel, which, they said, has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties, mostly women and children.\nThe SACBC said that the Pope was not anti-Israel, but pro-peace and pro-justice, and that he had shown his solidarity and compassion for the victims of violence on both sides.\n“When the atrocious attack, murder and abduction of innocent Israeli citizens by Hamas occurred on the 7th of October, Pope Francis clearly and unambiguously condemned it. He personally received some members of families of abducted Israelis by Hamas.”\n“Pope Francis is not anti-Semite, and neither is the Catholic Church anti-Semitic. He is a friend to the Jewish people and Israel,” the bishops said.\nThe SACBC challenged Goldstein’s assertion that the Israeli Army has done more to minimize civilian casualties than any army in history, citing the reports of shelling schools, hospitals, refugee camps, homes, mosques and churches in Gaza, and blocking humanitarian aid. The SACBC said that these actions could not be justified by the criteria of a just war, and that Israel had no moral right to engage in such conduct.\nThe SACBC also lamented the recent attack on a Catholic church and a convent in Gaza, where two women were killed by an Israeli Army sniper, and several others were injured by mortar fire. The SACBC said that this attack was an example of the brutality and injustice that the pope was denouncing, and that it contradicted Goldstein’s portrayal of Israel as largely innocent.\nThe SACBC concluded its letter by criticizing Goldstein’s description of the pope’s desire to see a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine as a “betrayal” of the Jewish people.\nThe SACBC said that the pope’s desire was in line with the international consensus and the legitimate aspirations of both peoples, and that it was not a threat to the existence or security of Israel, but a guarantee of peace and stability in the region.\nThe bishops also offered to meet Goldstein personally to further the discussion.",

    "text": "O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sancionou nesta sexta-feira (29) o projeto que cria um protocolo de combate e prevenção à violência contra mulher em casas noturnas, boates, shows com venda de bebida alcoólica e competições esportivas. A autora do projeto é a deputada Maria do Rosário (PT-RS). As regras foram aprovadas no Congresso no início de dezembro. Além de Lula, assinaram a lei, Cida Gonçalves, ministra das Mulheres, Camilo Santana, ministro da Educação, e Ricardo Capelli, ministro interino da Justiça. \"A proposta envolve setor privado e setor público, criando uma cultura de prevenção à violência para que toda mulher, de qualquer idade, possa frequentar um lugar sabendo que todas as pessoas lhe devem respeito acima de tudo\", diz a deputada. O protocolo determina que, no mínimo, uma pessoa da equipe do evento esteja preparada para executar a medida. Além disso, os eventos deverão ter informações sobre como acionar o protocolo e telefones de contato da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher (180). Segundo o protocolo, quando houver indícios de violência, o estabelecimento fica obrigado, entre outras coisas, a: - proteger a mulher; - afastar a vítima do agressor, inclusive do seu alcance visual; - garantir à mulher a escolha de seu acompanhante; - colaborar para a identificação das possíveis testemunhas; - solicitar o comparecimento da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente. Caso Daniel Alves A iniciativa foi apresentada em janeiro de 2023, como gancho do caso do jogador de futebol Daniel Alves, [ acusado de estuprar uma mulher de 23 anos em uma boate na Espanha. Ele está preso desde janeiro. O caso ainda está em julgamento](https://www.otempo.com.br/sports/futebol/justica-espanhola-marca-data-para-julgamento-de-daniel-alves-1.3297522). \"Foi a existência deste mecanismo e a adesão da Discoteca Sutton ao mesmo, o que assegurou à jovem de 23 anos ser retirada de imediato do local e levada de ambulância para exame de corpo de delito, ser observada por câmeras, ser atendida prontamente, ser protegida de possíveis novas agressões, ser acolhida para possíveis impactos sobre sua saúde integral\", disse Maria do Rosário.",

    "text": "Desde Chuquicamata el mandatario recordó la figura del presidente Salvador Allende y la creación de Codelco en 1971, cuando se nacionalizó el cobre.\nEl presidente Gabriel Boric celebró este jueves el 53 aniversario de la nacionalización del cobre y dijo que el mineral rojo es “el sueldo de Chile” y “la vía hacia un país más justo, libre y soberano”.\nEn una ceremonia en Chuquicamata, considerada la mina de cobre a rajo abierto más grande del mundo, Boric aseguró que la producción de cobre -del que Chile es el mayor productor del mundo- le ha reportado al Estado más de 160.000 millones de dólares desde 1971.\n“Ha sido el sueldo de Chile, pilar sobre el cual se han construido muchos de los beneficios sociales y políticas de bienestar con la que hoy cuentan los chilenos y chilenas”, indicó el mandatario.\nEl 11 de julio de 1971, durante el gobierno del presidente Salvador Allende, el Congreso aprobó por unanimidad la ley N°17.450, que traspasó al Estado la propiedad de la gran minería del cobre y creó la estatal Codelco, la mayor cuprífera del mundo.\n“Nuestro cobre sigue siendo una viga maestra y una vía hacia el futuro, hacia un Chile más justo, libre y soberano”, indicó el gobernante.\n“¡Codelco no se privatiza! Es más, Codelco no sólo no se privatiza, sino que avanza en nuevas funciones y exploraciones, como lo estamos haciendo con el litio, que también tiene que ser profundamente chileno”, agregó Boric, en referencia a la nueva estrategia que ha impulsado para convertir a la estatal en un actor relevante en la industria del litio.\nChile es el segundo productor mundial de litio, detrás de Australia, pero su producción en la actualidad se concentra solo en el Salar de Atacama y está concesionada a la chilena SQM y la estadounidense Albemarle.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "title": "EPA seeks input on new program to label cleaner construction materials as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda | US EPA",
    "text": "February 15, 2024 Contact Information EPA Press Office ( ) WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced an opportunity for public input on the draft approach for implementing a $100 million Label Program for Low Embodied Carbon Construction Materials as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.\nEPA’s new program, which was made possible by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – the largest-ever climate investment – aims to cut climate pollution linked to the manufacturing of construction products and materials, which accounts for 11% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions while supporting good-paying jobs and America’s industrial competitiveness. The improved air quality that results from climate pollution reduction aligns with President Biden’s environmental justice agenda.\nAs part of the Federal Buy Clean Initiative, the label program will help to define what constitutes “clean” construction materials in support of the Biden-Harris Administration’s landmark Federal Buy Clean Initiative , which leverages the Federal Government’s power as the world’s largest purchaser to spur demand for low-emissions manufacturing. The draft approach for the label program proposes to standardize and improve the data that manufacturers use in developing Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which disclose products’ key environmental impacts. It also proposes a process by which EPA would use data from EPDs and other sources to set thresholds for the amount of embodied carbon a product can have, relative to similar products, to qualify for the low embodied carbon label. The final phase of the draft approach is for the program to certify materials and products and to create a central registry of certified products.\n“President Biden is not only leading the transition to a clean energy future, but ensuring American workers and manufacturers are at the front of the pack,” said Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Michal Freedhoff. “The Biden-Harris administration’s new label program will expand market access for lower embodied carbon construction materials and help federal purchasers prioritize these materials.”\n“As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal Buy Clean Initiative, the federal government has begun procurement of over $4 billion in American-made low embodied carbon steel, concrete, asphalt, and glass for use in federal projects,” said Federal Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock, with the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “The Biden-Harris Administration is catalyzing markets for innovative and cleaner construction materials.”\n“Reducing emissions from construction materials is critical for our transportation climate strategy. EPA’s work on creating a Carbon Label Program will support the Department of Transportation and our stakeholder efforts to promote the use of low carbon construction materials by increasing transparency and consistency for tracking environmental considerations,” said Ann Shikany, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Department of Transportation.\n“GSA is pleased to be supporting this effort to increase transparency in low embodied carbon markets, including for the construction industry that we work with every day,” said Elliot Doomes, Commissioner of GSA's Public Buildings Service. “This is another key role for the federal government in helping develop a job-creating, American-made industrial base that drives sustainability and lowers costs for taxpayers.”\nEPA developed the draft approach for the label program with input from stakeholders, including the Federal Highway Administration in the Department of Transportation, the General Services Administration, other federal agencies, and members of the public who responded to a Request for Information that EPA published last year.\nUpon publication of the Federal Register notice, written comments should be submitted to docket EPA-HQ-OPPT-2024-0038 on the government Regulations page by March 15, 2024.\nOn Feb. 27, 2024, from noon – 1 p.m. ET, EPA will hold a webinar to solicit feedback on the draft approach. Register for the webinar .\nBackground:\nPresident Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act invests billions of dollars to reduce industrial emissions while supporting good union jobs, greater equity, and a strong manufacturing base, including $350 million to support EPA’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from construction materials. Today’s announcement follows EPA’s announcement of a $100 million funding opportunity for its Reducing Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Construction Materials program, which offers grants to help businesses develop EPDs to report climate pollution linked to the manufacturing of construction materials and products.\nThese actions support President Biden’s Buy Clean Initiative , which leverages the Federal Government’s power as the largest purchaser in the world to advance low embodied carbon construction materials in procurement and infrastructure projects. The Inflation Reduction Act also appropriated more than $2 billion to the General Services Administration to use low embodied carbon materials in the construction and renovation of federal buildings and $2 billion to the Federal Highway Administration to incentivize or reimburse the use of low embodied carbon construction materials in certain transportation projects.\nLearn more about these new programs funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
