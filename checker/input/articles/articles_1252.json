    "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an\nexecutive order on Wednesday “addressing acts of antisemitism in institutions of higher education.”\n“Antisemitism is never acceptable in Texas, and we will do everything we can to fight it,” he stated.\n“The State of Texas stands with Israel and the Jewish community, and we must escalate our efforts to protect against antisemitism at Texas colleges and universities and across our state,” the Republican governor added. “Across the country, acts of antisemitism have grown in number, size, and danger to the Jewish community since Hamas’s deadly attack on Oct. 7.”\nAbbott said the state “took immediate action to protect Jewish schools, synagogues and other key locations.”\n“Many Texas colleges and universities also acted quickly to condemn antisemitism, but some radical organizations on our campuses engaged in acts that have no place in Texas,” he said. “Now, we must work to ensure that our college campuses are safe spaces for members of the Jewish community.”\nThe executive order notes that “protected free speech areas on Texas university campuses, as well as the buildings and parking lots of Jewish student organizations, have been covered in antisemitic graffiti.”\nIt adds that students have chanted “antisemitic phrases such as ‘from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,’ which has long been used by Hamas supporters to call for the violent dismantling of the State of Israel and the destruction of the Jewish people who live there.”\nThe governor directs Texas colleges and universities to “review and update free speech policies to address the sharp rise in antisemitic speech and acts on university campuses and establish appropriate punishments, including expulsion from the institution.”\nHe also tells institutions to discipline the Palestine Solidarity Committee, Students for Justice in Palestine and other related groups when they violate such policies and to include the definition of antisemitism, which the state adopted, “in university free speech policies to guide university personnel and students on what constitutes antisemitic speech.”\nThe state has\ncodified the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHA)’s working definition of antisemitism into law.\n“The Combat Antisemitism Movement commends Governor Abbott’s decision today to issue executive order GA-44, aimed at combating antisemitism on college campuses,” stated Sacha Roytman, CEO of the Combat Antisemitism Movement.\nRoytman noted that the IHRA working definition “has shown to be one of the most effective tools for identifying and countering on-campus antisemitism.”",

    "title": "Rare Heath Fritillary butterly spotted on Exmoor - Somerset Live",
    "text": "One of the rarest species of butterfly in the UK has been spotted at a new location in Exmoor National Park. Heath Fritillary butterflies have been seen on Exmoor National Park Authority (ENPA) land at Ashton Cleave about 8km west of Hawkcombe Woods.\nENPA have been engaged in a long-term project to restore oak coppice in Hawkcombe Wood National Nature Reserve near Porlock to help the recovery of this Nationally rare butterfly, also traditionally known as the “woodmans follower\" because of its habit of occupying recently coppiced areas. It has been breeding successfully in Hawkcombe for a few years.\nThe first butterfly this year was spotted by a holiday maker in the area, they sent their findings to Butterly Conservation who work in partnership with ENPA.\nSenior woodland officer for ENPA Graeme McVittie said: “Working with Butterfly Conservation has led to some exciting work in our woodlands that will increase biodiversity and benefit rare species like the Heath Fritillary. Now is peak flight time for the Heath Fritillary, and it’s a sign that the mass emergence and dispersal of these butterflies last year resulted in a successful breeding population beyond their established core in Hawkcombe. This bodes well for potential colonisation of other Exmoor National Park habitat historically occupied by this type of butterfly”.\nThe sightings follow a report of the species last year at Heddon Valley (midway between Lynton and Combe Martin), which was probably the first seen in North Devon for at least a couple of decades.”\nExmoor National Park Authority is encouraging people to get involved with the ‘Big Butterfly count’ until Sunday, August 4. You can call in to any of the National Park centres in Dulverton, Dunster and Lynmouth to pick up a free butterfly identification guide and become a citizen scientist, helping to record rare and interesting species of wildlife like the Heath Fritillary.\nFind out more on the Big Butterfly Count website.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
