    "title": "House Speaker Says GOP Has \"Obligation\" to \"Eliminate\" Medicaid. What Will Monica De La Cruz Do?",
    "text": "De La Cruz & House GOP would risk health coverage for 27,000 people in TX-15 With inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Monica De La Cruz and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations. House Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.” Last week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid. Despite campaigning on making life more affordable for Texans, De La Cruz is poised to do just the opposite. DCCC Spokesperson Nebeyatt Betre: “Monica De La Cruz knows exactly what she is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.” ###",

Entonces, eso me fue afectando y desgastando las ganas de estar aquí en chile”, explicó. Debido a esto, buscó ayuda profesional y descubrió que estaba pasando por una depresión, que se desencadenó principalmente por estar alejado de sus hijos, quienes viven en Suecia. “No hay profesional en el mundo que me pueda ayudar de la forma que me entregan mis hijos”, confesó A pesar de todo, el músico volvió a Chile y actualmente está emparejado con Beatriz Fuentes, una chilena de 32 años.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "A new trailer for a documentary highlighting the pattern of sexual abuse [perpetrated by](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/09/louis-c-k-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-five-women-in-blistering-expose/) comedian Louis C.K. addresses the consequences of serial sexual misconduct in a post [#MeToo](https://www.salon.com/topic/metoo) culture. \"Sorry/Not Sorry,” which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, drags out the men — Joe Rogan, Neal Brennan and several other peers — who downplayed C.K.’s victims, made excuses for the comedian, or rejected accusations outright. It also dives into C.K.’s rehabilitation, and his Grammy-award-winning special, asking viewers to examine how the comedian was effectively able to profit off allegations of severe misconduct against him, even after [admitting](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/10/louis-ck-statement-apology/) to inappropriate behavior. But the documentary isn’t just about the perpetrator, or the culture of apology in our media landscape, as the trailer clues. C.K.’s victims are given screen time via new interviews, details from the journalists who broke the story, and input from fellow comedians. Opening with a clip featuring the disgraced comedian — accused in 2017 of masturbating without consent in front of numerous women — he's shown speaking to Charlie Rose — himself accused of misconduct — who compares C.K. to figures like Lenny Bruce, Bob Dylan, and “philosopher kings.” Here, viewers are reminded that C.K.’s legacy is not as damaged as he’d suggest. But throughout the project, the testimony of women who had their careers stalled, and who watched as a man who harassed them clung to a prolific career, shines through. Per an [interview](https://www.thedailybeast.com/louis-ck-documentary-lets-women-he-harassed-have-the-last-laugh) with the Daily Beast, filmmaker Caroline Suh — who directed \"Sorry/Not Sorry\" alongside Cara Mones — wanted to highlight the story of the victims, not just the perpetrator. “What was really so surprising [in making the film] was learning how hard it is to redirect one’s focus from worrying about the men—why Louis did what he did and what happened to him—to asking why it took so long for anyone to care,” Suh told the Daily Beast. “And most importantly, why we don’t really take much time to think about why women get so much punishment for just saying what happened.” C.K. takes up, like many abusers, the majority of the conversation surrounding his actions. Defenders argue that men like him have had too much of their [career taken away](https://www.salon.com/2019/01/08/why-are-comedy-clubs-still-booking-louis-c-k-comedy-works-ceo-gets-honest-about-the-conflict_partner/), often failing to focus on victims. Last month, fellow comedian Bill Maher amplified these sentiments, saying on an episode of his podcast with Bill Burr that he hoped C.K. would be “welcome[d] back” after he was “canceled.” \"People have done so much worse things and gotten less,\" Maher said. \"There’s no rhyme or reason to the #MeToo-type punishments.\" Watch the trailer for ‘Sorry/Not Sorry’ here ahead of its July 12 release.",

Joe R Biden’s Administration is, even today, still [refusing to sell 27000 US-manufactured M4 rifles](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-blocks-shipment-of-rifles-to-israel-over-concerns-of-west-bank-settler-violence-9764c87d) to Israel, for emergency defense. There are those within the JRB Administration who express concern that some of these rifles could “end up” in the hands of (Heaven forbid!) Israeli civilians, who might actually keep them in their homes for personal/home defense (a drill many Israelis sincerely wish they had practiced prior to 7 Oct 23). “Armed Jews” still apparently represent a truly frightening thought to leftist politicians, both here and ironically in Israel itself! They worry that these weapons might be used to threaten innocent domestic Palestinians (even though no such assaults have occurred). And yet, JRB [nonchalantly abandoned many times that ](https://www.ammoland.com/2022/11/full-list-of-american-weapons-left-afghanistan/)number of American military-grade M4s in Afghanistan during his panicked, helter-skelter “withdrawal” in the summer of 2021. One can only wonder where all that forsaken American [military equipment ended up.[read Hamas]](https://www.ammoland.com/2023/10/afghanistan-weapons-abandoned-by-biden-administration-appear-in-hamas-terror-attacks/) I think it is safe to say that none of it ended up in the hands of Israelis! The real issue here is that even governments that profess to be “enlightened” still don’t trust the very citizens who put them in power. The concept of “armed citizens” (Jews and everyone else) is always morbidly scary to aspiring autocrats who contemptuously look down upon the rest of us and see nothing more than a motley assortment of fools, bigots, clowns, and buffoons, their words! They don’t even trust members of our own (un)armed services, who have courageously volunteered to defend our nation. Leftist politicians will never respect us as sovereign citizens. We will always scare them. They have regard for none of us despite their less-than-honest rhetoric. This absolute reality was well known to our Founders, which is precisely why we have a Second Amendment as part of our Constitution, and it is, therefore, no mystery why leftists are trying so desperately to get rid of it! “I never feel unsafe, except for when the majority is on my side.” ~ Criss Jami. /John Read Related: [Full List of American War Weapons Lost In Afghanistan ~ VIDEO](https://www.ammoland.com/2022/11/full-list-of-american-weapons-left-afghanistan/#axzz8NIBMgfxV) [Afghanistan Weapons Abandoned By Biden Administration Appear In Hamas Terror Attacks](https://www.ammoland.com/2023/10/afghanistan-weapons-abandoned-by-biden-administration-appear-in-hamas-terror-attacks/) About John Farnam & Defense Training International, Inc As a defensive weapons and tactics instructor, John Farnam will urge you, based on your beliefs, to make up your mind about what you would do when faced with an imminent lethal threat.

Las temperaturas pueden alcanzar hasta 40ºC en algunos puntos de Andalucía. Las altas temperaturas activarán avisos importantes en Almería y Málaga, mientras que Córdoba, Huelva, Jaén, Sevilla, Albacete, Gerona, Lérida, Mallorca, Alicante, Valencia y Murcia estarán bajo aviso amarillo. En el caso de tormentas y lluvias, Guadalajara, Lérida, Tarragona, Castellón, Teruel, Barcelona y Gerona estarán en riesgo, con un aviso que sube a naranja para las últimas cuatro localidades. Además, las olas generarán un aviso amarillo en Gerona y Menorca, mientras que las rissagas afectarán a Menorca. En las Islas Canarias, Gran Canaria, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro y Tenerife estarán bajo alerta por fenómenos costeros, y Gran Canaria también tendrá un aviso por altas temperaturas. La jornada se caracterizará por la posibilidad de tormentas en la mitad noreste de la península, siendo más probables y fuertes en los Pirineos e Ibérica. En gran parte del país prevalecerá el tiempo estable, con cielos despejados o con nubes altas, aunque en el área cantábrica se esperan intervalos nubosos y precipitaciones débiles. También se formará nubosidad de evolución diurna en los Pirineos y sistemas Ibérico y Central, con posibles chubascos y tormentas dispersas, que ocasionalmente podrían incluir granizo. La AEMET no descarta tormentas secas aisladas en el valle del Ebro y zonas de la Meseta. En ambos archipiélagos y en el centro y sudeste peninsulares es posible la presencia de calima, y hay probabilidad de bancos de niebla matinales en interiores de Galicia, Cantábrico y alto Ebro. Las temperaturas descenderán en general en la Península y Baleares, especialmente las máximas en zonas del nordeste peninsular, con pocos cambios en Canarias. A pesar de los descensos, se seguirán superando los 35ºC en interiores de la mitad sur y depresiones del nordeste peninsular, y no se descarta que se alcancen los 40ºC en zonas del Guadalquivir. Las mínimas tampoco bajarán de 25ºC en el área mediterránea. El viento soplará alisio moderado en Canarias, con intervalos fuertes en zonas expuestas, y predominarán vientos de componente norte en la mitad norte peninsular y área mediterránea oriental. En general serán flojos o moderados, con intervalos de fuerte en Ampurdán. En el resto de la vertiente atlántica, Estrecho y Alborán soplarán vientos del oeste, con intervalos de poniente fuerte en el Estrecho.",

    "title": "#68 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\n[#65](c65#c-65) Las muertes no son sensacionalistas, la noticia es sensacionalista, y su falta de rigor, una falta de respeto a los que han sido asesinados. Además de aprovechar que el Pisuerga pasa por Valladolid para seguir esparciendo odio y desinformación...\nNo sé tú, pero yo este tipo de cosas ni las tolero ni me quedo callada, prefiero no ser cómplice de estas miserias.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#53](c53#c-53) ridiculizarlo si quieres.... Pero con Israel tenemos todo tipo de relaciones y bien estrechas, vamos de aliados, van de ser occidente, medio entran en europa, sobre todo socialmente, democracia plena etc etc ... No tiene absolutamente nada que ver.\nEsto es una masacre genocida por supuesto, ejem\n[#2](c2#c-2) .... Pro no es comparable. Si acaso, comparable a la masacre de Hamas.\n[#61](c61#c-61) Con Israel si, con Gaza no, mediáticamente deberíamos estar recibiendo un bombardeo de lavado de cara de Israel, pero es al contrario. Lo que esté bien o mal no me meto, no soy experto, pero la actitud de los medios ha cambiado y eso me inquieta.\nEs como si dentro de un mes encontramos todos los medios diciendo que Aznar ha sido el peor presidente, que hipotecó a España para décadas. Sería inquietante, llevan décadas lavándole la cara a Aznar y que cambien de rumbo significaría que algo ha pasado o que está habiendo algún cambio de poderes de influencia.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\n[#13](c13#c-13) \"les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo\"\nLeyenda urbana:\nhttps://www.indy100.com/showbiz/rambo-iii-afghanistan-mujahideen-taliban-b1904082\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",
