    "text": "A Dutch thriller series that debuted in the Netherlands on October 23, 2022 has gotten stellar Season 1 reviews by social media. X (formerly Twitter ) users have spoken highly of the series The Golden Hour (Het Gouden Uur) this month after it became available to stream On Netflix in the US on December 15. The show revolves around a detective of Afghan descent named Mardik Sardagh who searches to find his friend Faysal that may have something to do with terrorist attacks in the Netherlands. Dutch actors Nasrdin Dchar and Abbas Fasaei portray Mardik and Faysal. Season 2 is now possibly in the works but NL Film has seemingly kept quiet on what to expect. The Golden Hour (Het Gouden Uur) has been praised by social media users this month after it became available to stream On Netflix in the US on December 15 The show revolves around a detective of Afghan descent named Mardik Sardagh who searches to find his friend that may have something to do with terrorist attacks in the Netherlands. One report via Comingsoon.net have indicated that NL Film announced Season 2 of The Golden Hour last May, while another said it was only a limited series. Season 1 ends with Mardik realizing that a police officer may have helped Faysal in his attacks. The revelation comes after agent Joelle Walters (Ellen Parren) noticed a man who appeared to be a cop driving in a van to the location of an attack. Joelle tries to have Mardik identify the driver while he's in jail, but there was no luck. The identity of the man has not yet been revealed, which may be a big part of Season 2 if it does indeed happen. If The Golden Hour Season 2 gets the green light, it will come out on AVROTROS and NPO Plus in the Netherlands before debuting on Netflix in the US and other regions. Dutch actor Nasrdin Dchar portrays Mardik. Season 2 is now possibly in the works but NL Film has seemingly kept quiet on what to expect. X users have recommended people watch The Golden Hour since its December 15 release. 'It's got my approval was a really good series,' wrote an X user. Others have rated the show '10/10' despite one user saying it's 'crazy.' Some users that haven't praised the show believe that the show is promoting racism. One user wrote: 'The golden hour on netflix has to be one of the most racist propoganda shows ive sent in a minute.' Another X user who responded to the negative post also agreed with racism and dissed police officers who they said are 'cowardice.' Seen \"The Golden Hour\" on Netflix yet? https://t.co/adrgcco65V Social media users have praised the show but some have also accused the show of promoting racism and called police officers 'cowardice' Actors who starred in The Golden Hour have not yet announced if they would return for a second season of the hit show None of the actors have discussed if they would definitely return for a second season. Daily Mail has reached out to NL Film for comment.",

    "title": "Fairfield: 14 Arrested During Gaza Ceasefire Protest At Travis Air Force Base",
    "text": "Bay City News The Fairfield Police Department announced 14 arrests related to a Gaza ceasefire protest that blocked the entrance of Travis Air Force Base early Thursday morning. The protesters, numbering about 150, began their rally around 6 a.m., at which time the Fairfield Police Department and representatives of the Travis Air Force Base said they met with the organizers to allow them their constitutional right to protest while also ensuring service members were able to get on base. \"Unfortunately, almost immediately after that meeting, some of the protestors moved into the street and blocked both the North and South gates,\" a release from the police department said. The department also said that the protesters were then asked to leave the roadway several times individually and told they could continue their demonstration on the side of the road. Fairfield police said that they took 10 protesters from the North Gate and four from the South Gate entrance into custody after they allegedly did not comply with these commands and were subsequently booked into Solano County Jail for refusal to disperse. Travis AFB also confirmed that one protester, after crossing onto Travis AFB property, was briefly detained at the scene by Travis AFB Security Forces and promptly turned over to the Fairfield Police Department for further processing. Organizers said groups and attendees at the protest included Youth4Palestine-Sacramento, SF Bay Area CODEPINK, the Peace & Justice Center of Nevada County and Veterans For Peace. \"At a time when 70% of Americans polled, including 80% of Democrats, support a ceasefire resolution, it is appalling that the vast majority of Congress and our Democratic president are inhibiting a ceasefire, and continuing to send military aid to Israel,\" a press release from organizers stated. \"We have very few choices left, but to call on our own military to act out of conscience, and stand up for basic human rights of the Palestinian people,\" said Toby Blome, one of the organizers. The department said no force was used and no injuries were reported as a result of the protest or arrests. As of 9:30 a.m., the roadways were cleared and access to the base had returned to normal.
