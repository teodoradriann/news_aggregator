    "text": "The Oregon track and field team kicked off its calendar year with a stellar showing at the Graduate Classic in Lincoln, Nebraska. Across two days of competition, the Ducks collected 14 wins, broke a school record, and achieved several top-10 program marks.\nDay One: Pole Vault and Middle-Distance Victories\nThe Ducks tallied three top-10 program marks in the pole vault, highlighted by wins from Kyle Gibbs and Isabella Nilsen. Gibbs, making his Oregon debut, cleared a lifetime best of 5.39m (17-8.25), becoming the No. 6 indoor performer in program history. Nilsen, meanwhile, claimed the women’s title with a clearance of 4.19m (13-9), tying Nebraska’s Kylie Clark but taking the win on fewer misses. Nilsen’s mark moved her to No. 4 on Oregon’s all-time list, while teammate Emily Fitzsimmons placed third with an indoor best of 4.09m (13-5), good for No. 8 in program history.\nBella Nilsen DUB.\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nDucks go 2-2 in pole vault completions today with Nilsen vaulting 4.19m for a new PR![#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/A2LCuHTIvF][January 18, 2025]\nMatthew Erickson led a 1-2-3 Oregon sweep in the men’s 1,000 meters with a personal-best time of 2:20.66, while Tayson Echohawk secured the men’s mile title in 4:01.94, pacing a sweep of the top five spots. In the field, Safin Wills won the men’s long jump with a leap of 7.32m (24-0.25) and was joined in the top eight by three teammates, including Cheikh M’Baye, who placed third with 7.14m (23-5.25).\nCalm opener\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nIn his first competition as a Duck, Safin Wills wins the men’s long jump.

Redshirt freshman Kobe Lawrence broke the program record in the men’s shot put with a throw of 18.93m (62-1.25), surpassing the previous mark set in 2016. Lawrence placed second overall but delivered a performance that firmly etched his name in Oregon’s record books.\nFirst school record of the indoor season?\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nKobe Lawrence takes over the top spot in the shot put Saturday at the Graduate Classic.\n18.93m/62-1.25\nAll four legal marks were beyond the previous mark.[#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/DfRxZ36Bw6][January 18, 2025]\nIn the triple jump, Ryann Porter soared to victory with a personal best of 13.36m (43-10), becoming the fourth Duck in program history to surpass 43 feet indoors. The sprinters also had a banner day, with Jadyn Mays winning the 300 meters in 37.24 and leading a sweep of the top five spots. PJ Ize-Iyamu captured the men’s 60 meters in 6.70, and Aaliyah McCormick claimed the women’s 60-meter hurdles in 8.22.\n“I don’t even do this”\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nJadyn Mays after running a 300m in 37.24[#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/4Sd5ac4J9W][January 19, 2025]\nThe Ducks swept the 600 meters with wins by Matthew Erickson (1:17.38) and Ella Clayton (1:30.36).

For 2023, more retailers have signed up with Affirm, making it possible for consumers to enjoy a different payment option. In November, the company got a big boost during Cyber Monday as part of its expanded partnership with Amazon. Shoppers who opt for the BNPL service can split the cost of their purchase into four or more installments, which can be paid within three months to one year. One of the major selling points of Affirm is that the purchase does not accrue compounding interest. Money lenders are known for making money from interest payments, and higher interest rates are a pain for customers. Affirm's Finds Success Affirm was founded in 2012 by Paypay co-creator Max Levchin. The company is not alone in the BNPL service as it competes with Klarna, Block's Afterpay, and Zip. Regardless, shoppers have put their trust in Affirm, as evidenced by the company's skyrocketing sales. According to the company, their BNPL service is currently used by 16.9 million customers and has more than 266,000 merchant partners. With this, reports revealed that the company is seeking an international expansion. During its investor day last month, the company announced its plans to launch a spending account directly connected to its debit card, allowing ATM access and direct deposit. \"We get more data. We underwrite more transactions. We meet more people,\" an Affirm spokesperson promised.

    "text": "Oklahoma attorney general boots Board of Education counsel after friction over executive sessions The Oklahoma State Board of Education voted to table much of its agenda at Thursday’s meeting, saying it was uncomfortable voting due to a sudden change in the board’s legal counsel, affected by State Attorney General Gentner Drummond. If a state board chooses to use a private attorney, it must get approval from the Oklahoma Attorney General. It had been using attorney Cara Nicklas of the firm McAlister, McAlister and Nicklas. According to the Attorney General’s Office, Nicklas’ contract expired in June, but the department did not submit a contract extension for attorney general approval until mid-October. The State Department of Education did not immediately return questions on why the extension approval request was sent four months after the contract expired and if Nicklas had been receiving state funds for her legal counsel without an approved contract. Because the AG’s office is now serving as legal counsel for the board, a spokesperson for the office told StateImpact it could not comment on whether there would be consequences for the board to have used state funds on an unapproved attorney for four months. Records obtained through the AG’s office reveal friction between Nicklas and Attorney General Gentner Drummond spanning the last several months over lawmaker access to executive sessions. In June, Sen. Mary Boren (D-Norman) [was denied entry](https://oklahomavoice.com/2024/07/02/state-senator-says-she-intends-to-take-walters-education-officials-to-court/) to the board’s executive session. The [issue escalated](https://www.kgou.org/education/2024-07-31/ags-office-looking-into-potential-open-meeting-act-violation-during-state-board-of-education-meeting) with two additional lawmakers at the board’s July meeting, prompting the attorney general’s office to look into a potential Open Meeting Act violation. On Aug. 21, Drummond [issued a formal opinion](https://www.kgou.org/education/2024-08-21/oklahoma-ag-says-state-board-of-education-must-allow-lawmakers-into-executive-sessions) saying the board must allow lawmakers into executive sessions. Aug. 16, Drummond sent a letter to Nicklas admonishing her continued counsel to the board that lawmakers did not have a right to attend the executive sessions. In it, he said the board contacted Deputy General Counsel Thomas Schneider in June to seek guidance on whether lawmakers had a right to attend. “Since you did not agree with the answer or preferred a different answer, you essentially ignored it and now dismiss it as ‘non-binding.’ Based on your brazen disregard of sound counsel, you confuse ‘non-binding’ with ‘worthless,’” Drummond said. “Just because you are legally permitted to disregard the informal opinion of this office does not mean it is wise to do so. I frankly expect to see better judgment demonstrated by the attorneys I approve to represent state actors.” He added Nicklas’ original approved application to be the board’s legal counsel was made at a time the Legal Counsel Unit was “short staffed and did not have the bandwidth to provide adequate time and attention to [the board].” That process is [outlined in Oklahoma statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-74/section-74-20i/), shorthanded “20i.” “That is no longer the case,” Drummond wrote. “Accordingly, you are on notice that your firm’s 20i approval may be rejected at my discretion.” Wednesday, Attorney General Gentner Drummond sent a letter officially denying Nicklas’ approval and told the board it had three options: employ in-house counsel, present a contract for a different private counsel, or use an attorney from the AG’s office. For Thursday’s meeting, the board opted for the AG’s attorney, Brad Clark, who previously served as counsel for OSDE. It is unclear how the board will choose to move forward with counsel selection in the future. Board member Sarah Lepak raised questions at the meeting about how Clark would represent the board in circumstances when it conflicts with the attorney general, such as the recent issue of disallowing lawmakers access to executive sessions. “We were operating on advice of counsel, but if our counsel is also provided by the AG’s office to advise us or maybe defend us in those kind of situations, how does that work from a conflict perspective?” Lepak asked. “Because, I mean, you and I know, we’re both lawyers. In a regular setting, you can’t — as a lawyer — can’t be the prosecutor and the defense counsel.” Clark said he was “not aware” of the instance Lepak referenced. He said attorney general opinions are binding and would expect state officers to follow them. The board ultimately tabled much of the meeting’s agenda, saying it had legal questions and didn’t feel comfortable voting without prior conversations with the new board attorney. Those items included the proposed 2025 School Capital Improvements Budget, approval requests for a Christian school’s accreditation and a district to use textbook funds on non-approved books, and all teaching certificate revocations.

Num canto que parecia controlado por Butland, o guarda-redes do Rangers borrou a pintura ao desviar a bola para o interior da sua baliza.\nRuben Amorim podia respirar de alívio, mas nunca se terá sentido verdadeiramente confortável, sobretudo pela incapacidade do United em fechar o jogo.\nO Rangers, com uma resiliência a toda a prova, não atirou a toalha ao chão e chegou ao empate a dois minutos dos 90, por Dessers, que instantes antes tinha acertado no poste, num lance, ainda assim, em que parece ter partido de posição irregular.\nNo momento de maior aperto, elevou-se o capitão. Bruno Fernandes guiou os «red devils» ao triunfo ao finalizar, na cara de Butland, um cruzamento perfeito de Lisandro Martínez.\nO triunfo deixa o Manchester United no quarto lugar da fase regular da Liga Europa, com 15 pontos, em boa posição para avançar diretamente para os oitavos de final. Já o Rangers é 13.º, com 11 pontos.",

We see great potential in cooperating with Vietnam, a country that has made remarkable progress in promoting the transition to a circular economy. By leveraging all our shared experience, expertise and innovative solutions, we can achieve even more together,\" said Stork.Nguyen Hoa Cuong, deputy director of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said that the government has assigned ministries, branches, and localities to implement contents related to the development of a circular economy.Faced with increasing environmental pressures such as increasing waste and resource scarcity, the application of the circular model in Vietnam has become more urgent than ever. With the theme “Continuous Action”, this year’s VCEA event highlighted the importance of integrating circular initiatives and solutions into production and business activities, especially in areas such as industrial production, agriculture, packaging, and garments.A report on the current situation and development strategy of the circular economy shows that Vietnam has formed new markets for environmental goods and services, secondary raw materials, environmentally friendly products, green jobs, and especially the capital market for the circular economy.By June 2024, outstanding green credit had reached VND650.3 trillion ($27 billion), with more than 45 per cent for renewable energy projects and nearly 30 per cent for green agriculture. These investments play an important role in promoting circular economy initiatives in many fields.Kim Le, founder and CEO of CL2B, said that CL2B is aiming for a future where economic growth is no longer tied to the risk of resource depletion – a regenerative economy, where nature and business thrive together.“The circular economy is not only an opportunity to transform businesses, but also a necessary change in the way we think about socioeconomic development. Towards that future, we need to transform business models in an innovative way based on data and transparent policies. CL2B wants to lead that transformation by breaking down economic, social, and technological barriers based on respect and conservation of natural resources, while promoting social equity,” said Kim.The report on the implementation and strategic direction for advancing the circular economy in Vietnam reveals the initial establishment of capital markets dedicated to this model.The strategic partnership between CL2B and Rx Tradex has delivered significant impact for both events: VCEA 2024 and Waste & Recycling Vietnam Expo 2024.The conference was held alongside the exhibition, creating a unique synergy between two major sustainability platforms.This collaboration attracted new sectors, particularly in manufacturing, and increased the value of participation for attendees. By aligning VCEA with the Waste & Recycling Expo Vietnam 2024, both events gained a wider audience and greater impact, positioning themselves as the go-to platforms for driving sustainability initiatives in Vietnam.“This partnership with CL2B to deliver VCEA 2024 enables us to create a more comprehensive experience for participants and bring deeper insights into the waste management and recycling ecosystem. We hope that the integration of two events strengthens the sustainability dialogue and accelerates the circular economy in Vietnam.” said Vu Trong Tai, general manager of Rx Tradex Vietnam.Recognising the vital role of consumers in the circular economy, VCEA 2024 engaged the public directly for the first time by partnering with local artists. This collaboration used artistic expression as a powerful tool for encouraging sustainability, inspiring the community and advancing circular economy practices.In line with its theme of “Continuous Action”, VCEA 2024 extended its impact through two community-focused activities, from online to offline.As an annual non-profit initiative, this year's sponsorship and event proceeds supported the Regeneration Art Exhibition.Led by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Quoc Dan, the exhibit titled “Scrap Species” showcased how waste materials can be transformed into impactful art. The exhibition emphasised material regeneration and aimed to foster a deeper sense of responsibility for waste separation and environmental impact.One of the key art installations will be open to the public from October 4-20 at SunLife De La Sol Exhibition Centre in Ho Chi Minh City.Another activity, the Circular Momentum Podcast series, created an engaging platform for ongoing dialogue about the circular economy, featuring interviews with key thought leaders in the circular economy to spark further conversation and action. The six-episode series continues throughout the rest of the year, airing on CL2B’s YouTube channel. Chairman and CEO Jareeporn Jarukornsakul of WHA Corporation Public Co., Ltd. outlines five global initiatives, focusing on recycling resources in the production and consumption process through remanufacturing or reuse. The Vietnamese agro-forestry-fishery sector is building its own circular economy through enhancing international cooperation and multi-sectoral coordination. Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam, in tandem with VietCycle, held a training course on August 23 for informal workers who collect waste to show them how to classify everyday items that can be recycled.",

    "text": "Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez e Gayle King viajarão ao espaço na primavera\nPor Rita García - 27/02/25 às 20:00\nUm grupo de mulheres está prestes a realizar o sonho de viajar ao espaço: Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez e Gayle King estão prontas para abordar a nave Blue Origin para sua primeira viagem com uma tripulação inteiramente feminina.\nKaty Perry preserva seu teste de gravidez positivo: ‘Meu bastão de xixi’\nAs três se juntarão nessa aventura com outras três mulheres com trajetórias notáveis: Aisha Bowe, ex-cientista de foguetes da NASA; Amanda Nguyen, uma ativista dos direitos civis, e Kerianne Flynn, produtora de cinema.\nA notícia foi recebida com entusiasmo e um toque de apreensão por King, que descreveu a experiência como “aterrorizante e emocionante ao mesmo tempo”, comparando a sensação à expectativa do nascimento de um filho.\nPara tomar a decisão de viajar ao espaço sideral, King buscou a aprovação de seus filhos, Kirby e William, e de sua amiga íntima, Oprah Winfrey.\nA resposta de Oprah, em particular, foi crucial: ela incentivou King a aproveitar a oportunidade, argumentando que o arrependimento seria maior se ela deixasse a chance passar.\nReceba as Notícias de OFuxico em seu celular\nLauren Sánchez, noiva do fundador da Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos, desempenhou um papel fundamental na formação da equipe. Em uma publicação no Instagram, ela expressou sua empolgação e seu sentimento de honra em liderar um grupo de “exploradoras e contadoras de histórias”.\nA missão marcará o 11º voo humano do programa New Shepard da Blue Origin, consolidando o avanço do turismo espacial e inspirando futuras gerações de exploradoras.\nO voo espacial com Katy Perry e as outras celebridades está previsto para a primavera do Hemisfério Norte, ou seja, entre março e junho. No entanto, a data exata não foi divulgada.\nComo São os Voos ao Espaço?\nOs voos turísticos da Blue Origin, empresa de Jeff Bezos, oferecem uma experiência de curta duração no espaço suborbital. A nave é composta por um foguete propulsor e uma cápsula de passageiros, ambos projetados para serem reutilizáveis.\nOs voos não chegam a orbitar a Terra, mas atingem o espaço suborbital, ultrapassando a Linha de Kármán (100 km de altitude), considerada o limite entre a atmosfera terrestre e o espaço exterior.\nA viagem completa dura cerca de 10 a 12 minutos, desde a decolagem até o pouso da cápsula.\nOs passageiros experimentam alguns minutos de ausência de peso dentro da cápsula.\nA cápsula possui grandes janelas que proporcionam uma vista panorâmica da curvatura da Terra e da escuridão do espaço.\nAntes do voo os passageiros passam por um treinamento, que inclui instruções de segurança e simulações da experiência.\nRita García\nFormada em Ciencias de la Comunicación (México), louca por gatos e fascinada com o mundo dos famosos. Feliz de ser parte do OFuxico desde 2000.",

    "text": "Coal City fifth grader Hailey Fisher’s design was chosen as the Grundy County Sheriff’s office holiday greeting card for 2023. The Grundy County Sheriff’s Office sends around 250 Christmas cards each holiday to law enforcement agencies, businesses and community members. Past greetings have featured members of the sheriff’s staff including the canine cops. This year’s card features a penguin dressed as a police officer wearing a gold badge denoting service to the Grundy County Sheriff. Sheriff Ken Briley sent out a message in October seeking submissions for his department’s annual holiday greeting card. The contest was open to third to fifth grade students enrolled in a Grundy County school or homeschool. The rules were rather simple. The card needed to be in color, had a holiday theme and contained “no glitter.” Over 100 entries were received and Haileys design was one of the top selections. The top designs were then posted in the sheriff’s office and the deputies and staff voted for the one they liked the best and it was Hailey’s penguin card that stood out to the sheriff’s staff. Megan Wharrie, the sheriff’s administrative assistant, said it was the details in the design that set Hailey’s card out from the rest. In having her design selected in the first annual holiday greeting card contest won her entire class a pizza party. Sheriff Briley stopped by the classroom on Thursday, Dec. 21 to congratulate Hailey and meet with her class.",
