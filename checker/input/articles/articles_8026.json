    "text": "TWICE a day, sirens sound at Cambodia’s Chip Mong Insee cement kiln, warning that limestone will soon be blasted from the karst mountain towering over the sprawling industrial site.\nAt night, white smoke billows from its silver chimney, while dust coats much of the surrounding area.\nResidents complain of persistent respiratory illnesses that have arrived along with the kiln.\nThe plant might seem an unlikely player in the fight against plastic pollution, yet cement kilns are central to the burgeoning plastic credits market.\nBuyers pay for the collection and disposal of plastic waste, ostensibly to combat pollution and increase recycling. However, there is no requirement for them to reduce their own production or use of unrecyclable plastic.\nAn investigation by AFP and SourceMaterial reveals that the industry relies heavily on cement kilns to incinerate plastic waste as an alternative fuel, despite concerns over health risks and carbon emissions.\nThis technique, known as co-processing, can release toxic chemicals into nearby communities, particularly in countries with limited monitoring and regulatory enforcement.\n“The burden... is borne by the community, and the benefit is borne by those companies,” said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, a public health scientist. “You have a complete divorce of who benefits and who is harmed.”\nAround the kiln, local residents describe similar health issues.\nSmoke rising from a quarry at the Chip Mong Insee cement factory in Kampot province. — AFP\n“We’re often coughing,” said Pheara, a resident who, like others, asked to be identified only by a first name. “Before, when we got sick, we’d take a bit of medicine, but now we have to take multiple rounds and even change doctors to get better.”\nThe kiln has brought jobs to the area, but the trade-off has been steep.\n“I don’t want to live here because it’s so dusty,” Pheara added. “But I don’t know who would buy my house.”\nA ‘lazy’ solution?\nThe plastic pollution crisis is undeniable – at least 22 million tonnes of plastic waste entered the environment in 2019, according to the OECD.\nDeveloping countries like Cambodia, where waste management is inadequate, are among the worst affected.\nPlastic credits are supposed to help by funding waste collection and processing, with one tonne of waste generating one credit.\nBuyers, including subsidiaries of large corporations, use these credits to “offset” their plastic footprint or demonstrate environmental action.\nHowever, the sector lacks universal regulations.\nCredits are certified by self-appointed auditors with little government oversight. The market is still small, but BloombergNEF predicts it could generate US$4.2bil (RM18.5bil) by 2050.\nCritics argue that plastic credits provide a convenient loophole for corporations to continue business as usual.\nA general view of the Chip Mong Insee cement factory in Kampot province. — AFP\n“It’s a lazy, lazy solution,” said Piotr Barczak, circular economy programme manager for ACEN Foundation. “It enables plastic-producing companies to further continue their business model.”\nCompanies that offer and certify credits acknowledge that buyers are not required to change their practices.\nHowever, they argue that at US$140-670 (RM618-2,900) per credit, plastic credits make business-as-usual more expensive.\n“You start to hit a break-even point, where the economic incentive (is) to take more action,” said Sebastian DiGrande, CEO of credit registry PCX Markets.\nThe risks of co-processing\nPlastic credits heavily depend on co-processing, in which plastic waste replaces coal in cement kilns, with leftover ash used in cement production.\nAn analysis by AFP and SourceMaterial of four major credit marketplaces found that only about a quarter of credits were for recycling projects, while more than two-thirds were for co-processing or other forms of incineration.\nThis is partly because so much plastic waste is non-recyclable.\nHowever, co-processing also benefits the cement industry, which accounts for around 8% of global emissions, by allowing it to claim “circular economy” credentials.\nWhile co-processing is regulated in developed countries, oversight is often weak in other regions.\n“Often you might even have laws on the books, but they can be completely meaningless since they are not enforced,” said Jorge Emmanuel, an environmental health specialist at Silliman University in the Philippines.\n“Nobody is really monitoring emissions.”\nPeople travelling on a motorbike past burning plastic waste on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. — AFP\nInvisible pollutants\nCement kilns operate at high temperatures that should prevent the release of persistent organic pollutants like dioxins and PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”.\nHowever, Emmanuel warned that dioxins can still form when temperatures fluctuate or as mixed fuel is fed into the kiln.\n“When you introduce waste... you’re bringing in a whole new cocktail of contaminants,” said Lee Bell, policy advisor for the International Pollutants Elimination Network. “These are ending up in the cement kilns that are not designed to filter (them) out.”\nEven without co-processing, cement production is linked to pollution and health risks, including cancer, heart and lung diseases and adverse birth outcomes, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.\nJust outside the kiln, Kongthy, 56, runs a roadside cafe.\nShe says the smell of burning plastic frequently wafts in, and like her neighbours, she no longer collects rainwater due to dust contamination.\n“We don’t dare to collect it. We have to drink bottled water instead.”\nA flawed system\nSeveral kiln workers claimed they were not worried about safety, citing annual health checks and protective gear provided by the company.\n“They have filters,” said Vork, a kiln machinery operator. “It’s not like they’re burning it in a field.”\nChip Mong Insee did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe company receives plastic from Tontoton, a credit-generating firm. Neither firm replied to inquiries, while Tontoton declined to answer questions about its operations.\nCo-processing is often defended as the best available option.\n“We’re trying to do something better,” said Vincent Decap, co-founder of Zero Plastic Oceans, which sells Tontoton’s credits. “We’re not trying to do something perfect. If you try to do something perfect, you do nothing.”\nHowever, some experts believe co-processing simply replaces one form of pollution with another.\nA worker carrying a bag containing plastic bottles at a recycling depot on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. — AFP\n“Combusting plastic waste will displace further coal extraction,” said Ed Cook, a research fellow at the University of Leeds.\n“But we should avoid, and look for alternatives to, combusting fossil fuels whatever their source.”\nPlastic waste is expected to triple by 2060, yet less than a fifth is currently recycled.\nLast year’s negotiations for the world’s first global plastic pollution agreement ended without a deal.\nCritics argue that co-processing is a distraction from the real issue: reducing plastic production.\n“It’s a false binary,” said Neil Tangri, a senior fellow at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School.\n“Co-processing is mismanagement of waste that poses as a waste management system.”\nAs long as companies can buy credits without changing their plastic consumption, the fundamental problem remains: more plastic waste keeps piling up, and communities near cement kilns bear the hidden costs. — AFP\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

    "text": "By Shirley Gómez - New York April 04, 2024 5:16 PM EDT Sea buckthorn berries, a staple in traditional medicine across various cultures for centuries, are now gaining recognition for their potent medicinal properties, as highlighted by a recent study conducted at Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada.\nPublished in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture , this study underscores the remarkable potential of sea buckthorn berries in combating diabetes and obesity , attributed to their rich antioxidant content.\n©GettyImages\nThe harsh coastal environments where sea buckthorn thrives might be the key to its exceptional antioxidant properties. As the shrub faces environmental stressors, it responds by producing an abundance of antioxidants, offering a natural defense mechanism against the detrimental effects of free radicals on the body’s cells.\nRelated The Mediterranean Diet: Healthy and delicious pasta recipes\n‘Oatzempic’: the new dubious trend that offers a quick-fix solution to weight loss\nIntermittent Fasting: The surprising risks of time-restricted eating\nAntioxidants found in sea buckthorn berries are crucial in mitigating cellular damage caused by free radicals, which are byproducts of environmental stressors. The medicinal value of sea buckthorn berries extends beyond their antioxidant properties; they have been utilized for supporting digestive health, addressing cardiovascular concerns, managing skin diseases, and even treating ulcers. Dr. Menka Gupta , a functional medicine doctor, emphasizes the extensive historical use of sea buckthorn berries in traditional medicine across Asia and Europe. “The most documented use cases are for digestive health, stomach and intestinal problems, cardiovascular health, skin diseases, and ulcers,” Dr. Gupta told Medical News Today.\nThe recent study’s findings provide further evidence of the therapeutic potential of sea buckthorn berries, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. In vitro tests conducted as part of the study revealed promising outcomes, potentially shedding light on the berries’ ability to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Michelle Routhenstein , a registered dietitian, attributes these benefits to sea buckthorn’s rich nutritional profile, which includes vitamins C and E, flavonoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and dietary fiber.\n©GettyImages\nSea buckthorn berries have been used in natural remedies for a long time and are known for their medicinal properties in different parts of the world. They are a dietary staple in Asia and are prevalent in Europe for their ability to manage inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. Recognizing sea buckthorn berries as potent nutraceuticals highlights the combination of traditional knowledge and modern scientific validation.\nHealthy ways to consume sea buckthorn berries Sea buckthorn berries are known for their tart taste and high nutritional value. They are rich in vitamins C and E, flavonoids, and essential fatty acids. Here are several ways to consume this fruit.\n©GettyImages\nFresh: Eat them raw right off the bush. Be cautious of the sharp thorns on the plant while harvesting. Juice: Press the berries to extract their juice. Mix it with other fruit juices or water to dilute the strong flavor if desired. Smoothies: Blend the berries into smoothies with other fruits, yogurt, or plant-based milk for a nutritious and tangy drink. Tea: Steep dried or fresh sea buckthorn berries in hot water to make a tangy and nutritious tea. You can also mix it with other herbal teas for added flavor complexity. Jams and Preserves: Cook the berries with sugar to make jams, jellies, or preserves. This method helps to preserve the berries for a longer time while maintaining their nutritional value. Sauces: Cook the berries with sugar or honey to make sauces or syrups. These can be used as toppings for desserts, pancakes, or waffles. Salad Dressing: Blend sea buckthorn berries with olive oil, vinegar, honey, and herbs to make a tangy salad dressing. Supplements: Sea buckthorn berry oil is available in supplement form, which can be taken orally as capsules or added to foods and beverages for an extra nutritional boost. When consuming sea buckthorn berries or products made from them, it’s essential to consider their tartness and adjust recipes or combinations accordingly to suit your taste preferences. They can also be mixed to create ice cream, sorbet, or baked goods.\nRelated Video: Yelling At Your Dog Can Have Long Term Negative Effects Sign up to our newsletter to stay in touch with your cultura.

    "text": "There are a ton of great products that drop every week — and we’re here, as always, to keep you up to date on the best of them. Each week, we’ll be rounding up a short list of our favorite product drops from the last seven days for you to shop as you sip your morning coffee or take a quick break from work (trust, it’s the only list you need for staying up to date on these things).\nThis week brings the launch of Beast ’s stylish mini blender, a new sports collection from Draper James and Ikea ’s double launch of an at-home workout equipment line and retro-inspired collection. Shop our favorite new releases below, but be fast — they’re prone to selling out.\nDraper James Sport Activewear in florals and yes, gingham\nDraper James Reese Witherspoon’s lifestyle brand, Draper James, has just come out with a Sport collection — and if you’re sick of black and other utilitarian colorways and patterns on your workout apparel, this might just be your line.

Tones are rich — think deep burgundy and olive — and come in Persian and Heritage styles that go with a ton of types of decor.\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet and Brow Freeze Gel New year, new brows (and lip colors!)\nAnastasia Beverly Hills A matte liquid lipstick that goes on easily and doesn’t wear off? Here for it. Anastasia Beverly Hills’ newest $24 “lip mousse” gives you a ton of color and a weightless finish that doesn’t dry out your lips.

    "text": "Vikings agree to terms with free agent wide receiver Rondale Moore\nThe Minnesota Vikings agreed to terms with free agent wide receiver Rondale Moore on Wednesday.\nContract terms were not immediately clear.\nMoore, 24, spent his first three seasons with the Arizona Cardinals but missed all of last year after being traded to the Atlanta Falcons due to a knee injury suffered in an August practice. Moore was a second-round draft pick in 2021 and played in 39 games over his three seasons with Arizona, recording 135 catches for 1,201 yards and three touchdowns.\nThe New Albany, Ind., native built a reputation as a speedster during his college career at Purdue, and has been utilized in the run game during his NFL career, too. Moore will likely have the chance to compete alongside Jalen Nailor as the third receiver for the Vikings. He could also potentially be used in the return game, where he was a standout when at Purdue.\nMoore was the Big Ten Receiver and Big Ten Freshman of the Year during his freshman season at Purdue. The Vikings likely see the former second-round pick as a player who still has plenty of upside and could break out in Minnesota.",

After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

Bison Futé voit noir sur les routes et les autoroutes et recommande de décaler son départ. Même sur le chemin du retour, la circulation s&#039;annonce très dense. C&#039;est l&#039;heure du grand chassé-croisé des vacances. Et à cette occasion, la circulation sur les routes et autoroutes de France s&#039;annonce compliquée. Bison futé voit noir sur la route des vacances samedi. La circulation routière devrait être très dense de vendredi à lundi inclus avec un pic samedi donc. Bison Futé recommande d&#039;éviter la région parisienne pendant les JO 2024. La circulation sera difficile aussi dans la vallée du Rhône et le long de la Méditerranée, en particulier samedi &quot;extrêmement difficile sur l&#039;ensemble des grands axes du pays&quot;. Le conseil est &quot;dans la mesure du possible, de décaler votre déplacement pour éviter de prendre la route&quot; samedi, journée classée noire dans le sens des départs dans tout le pays, rouge en Île-de-France et sur l&#039;arc méditerranéen dans le sens des retours. Aucune zone épargnée Les difficultés commencent dès vendredi, classé orange dans le sens des départs, rouge autour de l&#039;arc méditerranée dans le sens des retours. Samedi, &quot;dès le début de la matinée et jusqu&#039;en fin de soirée, les axes desservant les régions côtières et frontalières du pays ainsi que les différents lieux de villégiature seront très fortement fréquentés&quot;, avec un pic en milieu de journée, prévoit Bison Futé. Dimanche, la circulation restera au rouge en Ile-de-France et en Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, mais reviendra à la normale partout ailleurs dans le sens des départs. Circulation compliquée dans le sens des retours Dans le sens des retours, les déplacements resteront difficiles sur l&#039;ensemble du territoire, en particulier sur l&#039;Ile-de-France qui reste rouge. La journée de lundi est classée orange dans les deux sens, rouge le long de la Méditerranée pour les départs. Rappelant que 185 km de voies autour de Paris sont réservées aux véhicules accrédités pour les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques, Bison Futé conseille par ailleurs aux vacanciers d&#039;éviter de traverser la région parisienne.",

    "text": "If you often notice the time is 10:10 and think there might be a special meaning behind it, you’re probably right. Seeing the number 1010 is not just a coincidence, it can be a divine message for you. The universe and your guardian spirits are trying to convey a message of action and forward movement. This angel number means you're on the right path to finding your true purpose in life. Trust that the universe has a plan for you, everything happens for a reason, and your higher self knows the best way to get you where you need to be. Believe that everything is happening for your benefit, and remember that everything will work out for you in the end.Keep in mind to trust your intuition and figure out what 10:10 means to you personally. Once you understand this message, you'll realise why you keep seeing this number and can use this knowledge to go further in your journey with guidance. To help you, here are the spiritual meanings of 1010 and the reasons why you might be seeing this number everywhere.Spiritual Meaning Of 1010The first two numbers 1 and 0 have great significance in the Angel Number 1010. Number 1 means moving into a new beginning, starting fresh or opening toward a new path in life. On the other hand, 0 signifies moving into the great void, where everything comes from the greater and will return to the creator. The numbers suggest you are moving towards a higher, more positive energy that is closer to the Divine. So, when you see 10:10 often, it means you should trust that the Universe is working behind the scenes to help you and be open to receiving what you need for your soul's growth.Another reason why you might be seeing this special number is that you might be in the process of awakening your true self. In this case, you are ready to walk on a new footpath that will lead you to achieve higher states of consciousness as you begin to explore your spiritual role.

    "title": "La publicidad en las redes sociales, tan omnipresente como aborrecida por el usuario",
    "text": "La gente abjura de la ubicua publicidad en las redes sociales\nLa publicidad en las redes sociales, tan omnipresente como aborrecida por el usuario\nEl 50% de los usuarios rechaza de plano los anuncios en las redes sociales y los tilda de inaceptables. Este porcentaje escala hasta el 55% en el caso de la publicidad de los influencers.\nPuede que la publicidad en las\nredes sociales encandile a los anunciantes, que son cada vez más dadivosos a la hora de invertir en esta fórmula publicitaria, pero al usuario de a pie no le entusiasman demasiado los anuncios en las plataformas 2.0. La gente contempla en términos generales con elevadas dosis de escepticismo la publicidad que se abren paso en las redes sociales.\nLo que menos agrada a los usuarios de la publicidad en las redes sociales es la flagrante ausencia de transparencia que se observan en los anuncios en las plataformas 2.0, según\nun reciente estudio llevado a cabo en Alemania por Die Medienanstalten. El 73% de los usuarios cree que la línea que se separa el contenido orgánico de la publicidad en las redes sociales es a menudo difusa (aunque existe la obligación legal de etiquetar como tales aquellos contenidos de naturaleza comercial).\nEl 50% de los usuarios consultados en el marco del informe rechaza de plano los anuncios en las redes sociales y los tilda de inaceptables. Ello convierte a la publicidad en las redes sociales sustancialmente menos popular que la que se abre paso en la radio (30%), la televisión (36%), las webs (38%) y los podcasts (39%), donde la proporción de usuarios que califican de inaceptables los anuncios merma considerablemente.\nLa publicidad de los influencers suscita aún más suspicacia entre los usuarios\nCon aún peores ojos contempla la gente la publicidad de los\ninfluencers. El 55% de los usuarios la rechazan de manera taxativa (y el porcentaje pega ostensiblemente el estirón entre los usuarios de más edad). En el caso de los mensajes comerciales de los influencers la mayor parte los usuarios se lamentan de la falta de transparencia a la hora de diferenciar con suficiente nitidez el contenido orgánico de la publicidad. Y quizás por este razón las recomendaciones de productos efectuadas por los influencers son rara vez contempladas como creíbles y ajenas a los intereses comerciales.\nMenos problemas parece haber, no obstante, a la hora de reconocer la publicidad en las redes sociales cuando no hay influencers de por medio. El 48% de los usuarios se ufana de tener un conocimiento más o menos sólido de la publicidad en las diferentes plataformas 2.0, aunque este porcentaje fluctúa lógicamente hacia arriba en el caso de los más jóvenes y hacia abajo en el caso de los usuarios más talludos.\nAsí y todo, conviene hacer notar que las etiquetas que advierten al usuario de que está siendo confrontado con contenidos comerciales en las redes sociales son a menudo pasadas por alto por la gente y no tienen demasiada incidencia a la hora de reconocer la publicidad como tal.\n[ ¡Suscríbete a nuestra newsletter! ](/newsletter) Sigue a MarketingDirecto.com en WhatsApp",

    "text": "Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes across Britain increased dramatically in the weeks after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, new figures revealed today.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nGreater Manchester Police saw the number of anti-Jewish hate crimes rise five times, while the British Transport Police saw offences spike more than tenfold.\nThe Community Security Trust (CST) described the figures as ‘shocking’ and said they made clear ‘the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7’.\nThe Home Office also condemned the rise in offences, adding: ‘There is no place for hate in our society.’\nAnti-Semitic calling Jews ‘evil’ was recently sprayed on skate ramps used by children in a park in Notting Hill, west London\nThe figures have been obtained using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\nGreater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). A spokesman for the CST said: ‘This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n‘It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.’\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that ‘levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging’.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a ‘significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7’, adding: ‘The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n‘We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.’\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nFull responses were obtained from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nTens of thousands of people gathered in central London for a rally against antisemitism in November\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings ‘provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7’.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had ’caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress’.\nA spokesman added: ‘We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.’\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n‘The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.’\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: ‘There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n‘We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n‘Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.’",
