    "text": "By Adam Holt ,\n2 hours ago\nThe Green Bay Packers are looking to get to 2-1 in Week 3 against the Tennessee Titans. If they want to do that, they will need to succeed on the ground once again.\nJosh Jacobs dominated in Week 2 with Malik Willis at quarterback. Jordan Love may return for the matchup against Tennessee, but we won't know that until ninety minutes before kickoff, according to head coach Matt LaFleur.\nRegardless, Jacobs just received some extra motivation to have an impressive outing against a Titans rushing defense that has allowed 92.5 yards per game in two games this season.\nJeffery Simmons doubts Packers' run game Simmons said that nobody runs the ball on the Tennessee Titans.\nIs he actually correct , though?\nThe New York Jets averaged around 4.5 yards per carry against the Titans last weekend. In Week 1, Tennessee did play the run a bit better. Chicago Bears starting running back Deandre Swift averaged just three yards per carry on ten carries.\nTennessee has the talent on the defensive line to slow down the Packers running game, but you can argue that Green Bay has had the best rushing attack in football through two weeks of play.\nThey're averaging 212 rushing yards per game, and Jacobs looks fresh in their offense. Emanuel Wilson has been efficient for GB, too. He's averaging 6.1 YPC so far this season. He deserves the clear backup role for the Packers.\nNo matter what - Jacobs is the X-Factor for the Pack in Week 3. He's breaking off chunk plays better than any other RB in the league, and that needs to play a factor this Sunday against the Titans.\nNow, the recent disrespect from a top Titans talent may raise his standards for himself in this matchup even more.\nRelated: How to watch, stream, and listen to Green Bay Packers at Tennessee Titans in week 3\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

(From NTSB) The woman who was a passenger in a plane that crashed near Anchor Point earlier this month, killing the pilot, has died as federal investigators say one of the plane’s wings was seen on video buckled during its descent.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report Wednesday about the Dec. 8 crash that killed Kurt Stjean and seriously injured Kristen Fenske. Alaska State Troopers said Fenske died Wednesday morning.\nReport_ANC24FA008_193500_12_27_2023 3_59_10 PM Download According to the report, the plane – a Piper PA-18-150 – was flying from King Salmon to Homer when it crashed at around 1:15 p.m. on Dec. 8. NTSB investigators retrieved video from a vehicle’s dash camera that showed the plane spinning before the crash. While falling, the left wing appeared to be folded against the main body of the aircraft.\nAfter the onsite investigation, the board brought the wreckage to Wasilla. There, a board investigator and structural engineer from the plane’s manufacturer will examine the plane to determine the cause of the crash.\nThe plane wreckage near Anchor Point, seen during an on-site investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. (From NTSB) Clint Johnson, the NTSB’s Alaska chief, said the video indicates the left wing somehow failed before the crash.\n“We don’t know what the initiating event was, but we’re going to be centering it on the left wing at this point right now,” he said.\nThe investigation typically takes around a year to complete, Johnson said, but anything related to the aircraft’s safety will be released immediately.\nJohnson asked that any crash witnesses the board has not yet contacted to email witness@ntsb.gov.\nJamie Diep, KBBI - Homer",

    "text": "I was watching a member of the stolen generation explain on a television show that when the children were taken away from their homes, from their parents and relatives, not allowed to speak their language, beaten and abused, that it was thought at that time, that that was in the best interests of the removed children. Today we are horrified that anyone would consider that this policy was in the best interests of children.\nToday, to determine what is in the best interests of children of\nseparated parents we look to the\nFamily Law Act 1975 (Cth).\nFundamental to the operation of Courts today administering the Family Law Act is that when a Court considers the decision it is required to make in parenting matters that its paramount consideration is the best interests of the children. How a Court determines what is the best interests of the children is to some extent governed by the Act itself.\nThis is important because the Act is about to change on 6 May,\n2024 and the change is driven by a number of family law reviews\nover the past decade, the latest being the Australian Law Reform\nCommission's 2019\nreport and the 2023 Government Response to the Joint Select\nCommittee on Australia's family law system.\nThe changes include:\n- The objects of the Act have been simplified to require the Court to ensure the best interest of children are met, including by ensuring their safety.\n- The presumption that it is in a child's best interest that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility is out.\n- The Act now provides that each parent has parental responsibility for making joint decisions about matters that affect a child in the long term, but this can be overruled by a Court order.\n- Parents are now required to consult when making joint decisions about matters that affect the child in the long term and when making those decisions the best interests of the child have to be the primary focus of the parental decision making.\n- The 16 factors a Court previously had to consider when determining a child's best interests are out.\n- A Court is now required to consider the child's safety, the child's view, the child's needs, the capacity of the child's carer to provide the child's needs, the benefit of the child having a relationship with the parents or other significant person to the child, any other relevant matter, and a child's right to enjoy their Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.\n- The section that required a Court to consider whether a child spending equal time with each parent was in the child's best interest is out.\n- An additional clause has been inserted in the Act which has codified the case of Rice & Asplund (1979) FLC 90 725. Now in a matter where there are previous Court orders, a Court must not reconsider the case if there has not been a significant change of circumstances and it is not in the child's best interest to re-open the case.\nThese changes are the beginning of a range of family law reforms aimed at ensuring separating couples can better understand the family law decision-making framework to resolve parenting matters safely and effectively.\nThe evolution of the law insofar as it relates to children in Australia reflects a significant shift from prioritising parental rights to emphasising the best interests of the child. This change underscores the importance of safeguarding children's well-being during and after family breakdowns. While challenges persist, the ongoing commitment to prioritising children's needs within the legal framework bodes well for the future of Australian families, by helping them resolve parenting matters in an amicable and child-centred way.\nFurther reforms are coming in relation to property settlement, children's contact services; and the Court's Case Management and procedures, so stay tuned.\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.",

    "text": "The Denver Broncos benched quarterback Russell Wilson on Wednesday, a move that will protect the team from having to pay the quarterback future salary that’s guaranteed for injury.\nHad Wilson suffered a serious injury in one of the team’s final two games of the 2023 season, $37 million of his 2025 salary would become locked in. Broncos coach Sean Payton insisted Wednesday that he made the decision in an effort to win , but multiple outlets have reported that the benching was financially motivated.\nWilson has not publicly spoken to the media since his benching, but he “liked” a series of tweets on Twitter/X that suggest Denver benched him for financial reasons, not his performance.\nIn today’s age of social media, “liking” the tweets is just as revealing of a statement as a literal statement from the quarterback. Wilson clearly seems to be endorsing/confirming the story that the Broncos threatened to bench him if he did not adjust his contract.\nWilson “liked” the following tweets on Wednesday:\nRussell wilson has the seven ties passer rating in the nfl, 26 passing TDs which ties him with Tua and Mahomes (with fewer INTS than either), and leads the NFL in 4th quarter comebacks and game winning drives.\nThere's no marrative from me bud.
