    "title": "Fact Check: Video Does NOT Authentically Depict DNC Attendees Chanting 'Death To America' -- Audio Is Added",
    "text": "Does a video shared to X genuinely show attendees at the 2024 Democratic National Convention chanting \"Death to America\"? No, that's not true: The video on social media has added audio from a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Oakland, California. An unedited video of former first lady Michelle Obama's speech, which is shown in the video on X, does not include the chanting.\nThe claim originated in a\nvideo shared to X on August 21, 2024, (archived here) with a caption that read:\n🚨🚨'Death to America' chant heard at DNC 🚨🚨\nHere is how the post appeared at the time of writing:\n(Source: X screenshot taken Thu Aug 22 08:07:00 2024 UTC\nMichelle Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention on August 20, 2024, in Chicago. Lead Stories watched several unedited videos of her speech, including those posted by\nCBC News (archived https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/LjPrX2H7YeA) and PBS NewsHour (archived https://ghostarchive.org/search?term=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYgJBFBwRXvc&go=Go). No version of the actual speech included audio that matched the \"Death to America\" chants heard in the video on X.\nThe audio was taken from a video posted by\nGrabien (archived https://archive.ph/lTwXX), an online news video marketplace where users can buy and sell pre-edited news clips. The video, titled \" BLM Protesters in Oakland, Calif. Chant 'Death to America!'\" was posted to YouTube on September 1, 2020, (archived https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/Kb9rT611WQw) by Grabien. The video description links to the https://news.grabien.com/story/blm-protesters-oakland-calif-chant-death-america (archived https://archive.ph/qb1Rm) on the Grabien website with the same title.\nThe\naccount (archived https://ghostarchive.org/archive/YAJzs) that posted the video with added audio on X included a link to a website for Dilley Meme Team, which is described on its \"About\" page (archived https://ghostarchive.org/archive/XMBI7) as:\nYou know who we are, it's why you're here.

    "title": "Marriage binding rules (II)",
    "text": "THE next categories of these roles are exclusive to the wife, and first among them is the need for her to surrender herself to the authority of her husband. Her allegiance is to her husband. She rarely goes to see her parents once she was given in marriage. Her loyalty to the husband is foremost. Instructions given by her husband are paramount over and above those which may come from her parents because that is the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). The woman must take permission duly from her husband for whatsoever she may want to involve herself in. An authentic narration from Nahnah Aisha (R.A.) subscribes to this tradition.\nSecond is the sacred role of a faithful watch which the woman must assume over her husband’s assets, including herself. Muhammed Ibn Saheed Ibn Saab (R.A.) narrated that the Prophet (SAW) spoke of three indications which confirm a Muslim as very fortunate in the sight of Allah (SWT). The Prophet (SAW) mentioned a dutiful wife who keeps her chastity at all times and keeps watch over her husband’s property in his absence. The Prophet (SAW) said such a wife remains abundantly favoured in the sight of Allah (SWT) and the husband, too, shall relish her goodness. Reverse shall be the case for a Muslim considered very unfortunate and ill-fated, because his wife is unfaithful and negligent about his belongings. This narration buttresses the significant role the wife needs to undertake by safeguarding her sacredness and all other belongings of her husband when he may be away from home. The husband is expected to be glowing in happiness for the gift of a virtuous and pious woman with whom he is blessed by Allah (SWT).\nClose to this is the duty that bars the woman from having association or affinity with any other man. Her doors and vicinities should be out of bounds to other men who are not her relations. She should not keep company of any unidentifiable adult male. The Prophet (SAW) insisted that a woman whose husband has provided for all her material needs upon his leaving on a journey does not have much justification leaving her home. The Prophet (SAW) admonished the Ummah to hold such a woman responsible for any evil done onto her by unforseen circumstances, particularly because she has no business being outside the roof of her legitimate home. In fact, the Prophet (SAW) invoked heavily on women in the Ummah who go out of their husbands’ shelter undressing themselves or being undressed by other men, even when intentions behind the act were nothing amorous. The Prophet (SAW) invoked that such women would never enjoy the good sight of Allah (SWT) [Maliyah Alhudahiyu (R.A.) narrated].\nEqually, Islam mandates wives to take instructions from their husbands. These directives become golden inasmuch as they do not run foul of all that the Qur’an prescribes and are treated in the Khitaab Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). A woman has no other principal in the whole wide world besides the man she is legitimately married to. She must practically take to his orders, albeit orders which must not contravene Allah (SWT)’s sacred injunctions in the Qur’an and tradition of the Prophet (SAW) in the Hadith. Read Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 34 (Qur’an 4:34) for more insights. Spiritual benefits abound for the wife whose affairs are guided and led by her husband’s authority.\nOne of the authentic Hadith holds that such a woman shall be offered a blank cheque on the Day of Qiyaohm (Day of Accountability) to choose freely from one of the eight levels of the Paradise (Jahnah) for Allah [SWT]) is well pleased with her conducts here on earth. Another benefit that comes her way is Allah (SWT)’s magnanimous acceptance of every bit of her ibaadat’lah (acts of worship) such as her eeman (faith in monotheism), sohlat (the five obligatory prayers), saawm (the yearly obligatory fasting) etc.\nAncillary matters abound with a woman taking orders and instructions unquestionably from her husband. For instance, she should not dole out a grains of food items (rice, beans, millet, corn, bread, meat, fish, even water) belonging to either her or her husband except she takes prior permission from the husband. She must be alive to and respond to her husband’s intimate desire of her, even at times when she may not be well disposed. Otherwise, she stands the wrath of Allah (SWT) till the break of a new day.\nTaking the express permission of the husband for virtually all she does on a daily basis is equally important for the woman to uphold as a duty to the husband. She must always seek the permission and consent of her husband whenever she must go to attend to matters outside her home. She must carry the husband along in every major decision she may have to take. She cannot afford to take him out of the picture in any matter before or after the husband knows about such. As stringent as it were, the woman should not engage in any of the very noble acts of extra-rewarding ibaadah (religious worship to Allah[SWT] alone) which are required but voluntary if she has not obtained express permission of her husband. Examples of these include fasting in the tradition of the Prophet (SAW) on Mondays, Thursdays and 13th, 14th, 15th day of every lunar month, undertaking if umrah pilgrimage (lesser hajj), all forms of charity, get-well visitats to the sick in hospitals, withdrawal into spiritual seclution in the final days of lunar month of Ramadan (I’tikaf), as well as pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina on hajj.\nMuslim women must also avoid causing their husbands any kind of harm, misfortune or calamity. The Prophet (SAW) in an authentic Hadith made it known that any evils caused deliberately by a woman onto her husband is duly noted in Jahnah (Paradise) by virgins of Paradise in the High Heaven where the husband shall eventually take an everlasting abode with these virgins who shall dispense evil invocations on such a woman inflicting unprovoked and unwarranted pains and inhuman treatment against their husband in paradise.\nIt is equally considered a very huge responsibility for a Muslim woman to take absolute care of the day-to-day well-being of her husband. The entire chores in the household ranging from cooking, laundry, cleaning and general hygiene in the house are within the purview of the woman. It was reported in the Hadith (authentic) that Nana Aisha (R.A.) was just too overwhelmed with her daily domestic chores that she chose to request the Prophet (SAW) to employ the service of a housemaid who would do some of the chores. However, the Prophet (SAW) discouraged her, pleading with her that it would be rewarding for her to continue to discharge those chores, and in addition she should begin suplicating to Allah (SWT) with ‘Adhkar’ (selected rendition which a pious Muslim does regularly by praising and adoring Allah (SWT) in exaltation), saying “Subhanalah” 33 times, Alhamdulilah 33 times and “Allahu Akhbar 34 times.\nPart of expectations from a dutiful wife is her gratitude to the husband out of genuine sense of appreciation in all forms towards great gestures extended to her by the husband, intimacy between them inclusive. The Prophet (SAW) particularly insisted on this very simple but significant role for the wife, saying that one of the reasons women are considered dominant residents of Jah-ahnam (hellfire) may be for their sheer flippancy when they should acknowledge every favour and kindness done onto them by their husbands and show appreciation to them.\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM\n NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Primate Ayodele releases 91-page prophecy for 2024\nThe leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released his prophecies for 2024 as it is…\nNIMC issues new guidelines for date of birth modification\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued new guidelines for the modification of…\nSen Natasha spreads Christmas cheer with generous palliatives in Kogi Central\nIn commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), has put smiles on…\nFive Nigerian musicians who had the biggest hit songs in 2023\nNigeria’s music industry had a remarkable year, with talented singers and hit songs making…\nHistory will judge me, I gave Nigeria my best as ‘president,’ IBB declares\nFormer military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) has said history will judge him as leader of the country for…\nAnthony Joshua beats Otto Wallin in five rounds\nAnthony Joshua delivered one of his best displays in recent memory with an impressive stoppage of Otto Wallin in…",

    "text": "Los Angeles, California--(Newsfile Corp. - December 28, 2023) - Locker Room Insurance is a forward-thinking insurance brokerage co-founded by 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Calvin Johnson Jr. and Rob Sims, his former NFL teammate, along with experienced business executive and licensed insurance agent Craig Freeman. Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance.\nJohnson Jr. , known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation , which has made a difference for nearly 13 years.\n\"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said.\nSims , a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people. It fills us with excitement to empower those without similar opportunities, enabling them to secure their family's financial future and enhance the community.\"\nLocker Room Insurance\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8798/191320_bd8138025409e9b3_001full.jpg\nFreeman, a mission-driven executive known for his broad business acumen and servant leadership style, is equally excited about the program and its impact on the community.\n\"A quarter of the population doesn't have any type of insurance,\" Freeman observed. \"We want to be able to help. Rob and Calvin have a lot of people they love to help in various ways, but they can't take all of them to the NFL. They might also not be able to help them with other capital-intensive ventures. With insurance, they'll help many agents change their lives and their families' futures through a low barrier entrance, low capital insurance model.\"\nTo get an in-person look at how they operate, apply for an opportunity to attend the Locker Room Insurance launch party in the Detroit area later this year, where they will hosting a NFL Playoff watch party as well as providing a business overview for prospective agents.
