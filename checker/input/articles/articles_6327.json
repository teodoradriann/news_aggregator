    "title": "Amid Trump battle, layoffs, cuts spread at Harvard",
    "text": "The war on harvard Some postdoctoral researchers at Harvard University this summer are seeing their contracts renewed for three months, rather than the usual 12. Labs are killing their mice to save the $1.40 per day it costs to feed each cage and clean up after. And a Harvard Medical School facility designed to create teensy devices like nanosensors — a resource for researchers on the Cambridge campus and its affiliate hospitals — is shutting down next month after 18 years.\nEach small cut is a way to make up for the $686 million in federal research funding Harvard received last year but cannot count on anymore. Rumblings of an impending deal with the Trump administration to restore funding in exchange for tweaks to university policies do not change the reality on the ground: Right now, Harvard is pulling from a far smaller pool of money for day-to-day operations than it expected, and cuts are rippling through the university, according to interviews with dozens of faculty, staff, and graduate students.\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up Department chairs are drafting memos planning belt-tightening measures. Rumors are spreading about widespread layoffs in the coming weeks. And a research scientist who created an acclaimed database of lost federal funding across the country will be terminated himself in October, unless his grant is somehow re-upped.\nAdvertisement\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the center of undergraduate and PhD studies at Harvard, is largely spared, though it has lost 320 grants, worth about $400 million. And the Harvard Kennedy School is laying off “some members of our team,“ eliminating some office space, and pausing ongoing construction projects, its dean wrote in an email Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nHarvard’s medical and public health schools, which rely on federal dollars to support up to 40 percent of their operations, will bear the steepest consequences. Harvard Medical School also operated in the red for several years before President Trump’s second term.\nThe public health school has already made “deep cuts across our administrative and operations budgets,” according to a schoolwide email its dean Andrea Baccarelli sent in early June, instructing researchers to pause equipment purchases, new contracts, and hiring.\n“Over the next year, we must adapt to a new world,” he wrote. “Our sources of research funding will change. Our commitments to academic excellence and high-impact scientific discovery will not.”\nFaculty at both the medical and public health schools are eyeing the end of the fiscal year next week as a time when more layoffs could come down.\nFaculty at Harvard Medical School are eyeing the end of the fiscal year next week as a time when more layoffs could potentially come down. Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff It’s like no challenge the university has faced before. After the 2008 recession dented Harvard’s endowment by $9 billion, the school trimmed its budgets, pulled back on outside investment, and hit pause on its expansion in Allston. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard avoided widespread furloughs or job layoffs .\nBut this year’s federal funding cuts take away cash, perhaps for good, that Harvard researchers were already promised and had made plans for.\nThe Trump administration teased an ongoing negotiation with the university last Friday for a “historic” deal, but has not provided details. In the future, the federal government hopes to cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by 40 percent . And even if Harvard wins lawsuits to protect its current grants or reaches a detente, there is no guarantee any new federal spending will come its way.\nAdvertisement\nFor many faculty and staff, the focus now is not to shrink Harvard’s workforce and research arm more than necessary. While most of its $53 billion endowment is restricted for specific uses, Harvard certainly has enough in the bank to make payroll, and in May, committed $250 million to extend funding to some projects whose grants were terminated.\nBut even that only covers 80 percent of lab expenses at most until the end of the month.\nWith limited funding, discoveries backed by years of data and trials may be cut short, and the scientific community has raised the alarm about a backslide in the country’s competitiveness on the international stage.\nFor next year, Harvard Medical School has created a plan that patches together $90 million in university funding, $90 million more in reserves from HMS, and a $30 million loan. That will backfill most of the $291 million in lost grants through next June.\nStephen Blacklow, chair of the department of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at the medical school, said that money helps “prevent overcorrection” to the White House’s cuts.\n“These are huge expenses being absorbed by the institution in the short term with the goal of helping existing robust and vital programs get through a year without irrevocable harm,” he said.\nAs for students, Harvard has issued statements vowing to support both master’s and PhD candidates through the end of their programs, but some students said they are already being urged to graduate early by professors who are wary that the funding that supports their work will not come back.\nAdvertisement\nRumblings of an impending deal with the Trump administration do not change the reality on the ground: Right now, Harvard is pulling from a far smaller pool of money for day-to-day operations than it’s used to. Heather Diehl for the Boston Globe Kees Benkendorfer, a Harvard PhD candidate in particle physics, sped up the timeline to present his dissertation from next May to this fall as he hunts for jobs in Canada and Europe. He has spent four years in the Harvard ATLAS program, which explores high-energy particle collisions, but federal support for his work is fading, Benkendorfer said.\n“There is a sense that there is no longer any security with US scientific funding,” he said.\nThen there’s the Harvard staff. A web of grant writers, administrators, and research scientists who are neither faculty nor students play a crucial role at many labs. Most of those positions are entirely funded by federal dollars and outside contributions and are vulnerable with most of that money now gone.\nThe positions are not being eliminated in lump sum or big announcements, but news of piecemeal cuts has dribbled out. Several nonunionized staff members at the public health school have been told their contracts will not be renewed after they end in a few weeks, according to two administrative staffers who’ve been told they’ll soon lose their jobs. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized by Harvard to speak about the cuts.\nIn the public health school, “cheat sheets” that describe protections for laid-off employees — later reviewed by the Globe — show that Harvard eliminated many benefits it typically provides for people let go after February, when Trump first threatened federal dollars at Harvard. Because of the changes, an administrative staffer said she will not receive severance or health benefits after her contract ends.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "En un nuevo estudio, dirigido por el Departamento de Física de la [Universidad de Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) y publicado en Nature, un grupo internacional de autores que desarrollaron la ciencia en la que se basa el cero neto demuestra que confiar en los \"sumideros naturales de carbono\", como los bosques y los océanos, para compensar las emisiones de CO2 derivadas del uso de combustibles fósiles no detendrá realmente el calentamiento global. La ciencia del cero neto, desarrollada hace más de 15 años, no incluye estos sumideros naturales de carbono en la definición de emisiones netas de CO2 inducidas por el hombre. Los sumideros naturales desempeñan un papel vital para moderar el impacto de las emisiones actuales y reducir las concentraciones atmosféricas de CO2 después de la fecha del cero neto, estabilizando las temperaturas globales. Sin embargo, los gobiernos y las empresas recurren cada vez más a ellos para compensar las emisiones, en lugar de reducir el uso de combustibles fósiles o desarrollar opciones de eliminación de CO2 más permanentes. Las normas de contabilidad de emisiones fomentan esta práctica al crear una equivalencia aparente entre las emisiones de combustibles fósiles y la reducción de CO2 por algunos sumideros naturales de carbono, lo que significa que un país podría parecer que ha “alcanzado el cero neto” mientras sigue contribuyendo al calentamiento. Los autores piden a gobiernos y empresas que aclaren hasta qué punto cuentan con los sumideros naturales de carbono para cumplir sus objetivos climáticos, y que reconozcan la necesidad de alcanzar el Cero Neto Geológico.",

    "text": "转自：贝壳财经\n“求靠谱的志愿填报老师，不在乎价格，只想上好大学。”“真的需要花上万元找人帮忙选专业吗？”2025年的志愿填报季刚到，此类疑问与求助就占领了各大社交平台。\n志愿填报找机构，真的比自己填更靠谱吗？据《中国新闻周刊》披露，2024年，山东考生杨楠花5499元，请高考志愿填报规划师帮助填报志愿。录取结果公布后，杨楠的96个本科志愿全部滑档。接下来是专科志愿填报，她报了61个“3+2”专本贯通专业，“规划师说能稳上”，结果又全部滑档。\n据报道，杨楠这样的案例并不罕见。一些机构的规划师只会简单地使用相关软件，就敢收取四五千元的咨询费，在纯线上服务中，这一现象尤为普遍。\n高考志愿填报，事关考生的未来。对于相关机构而言，这里充满商机。杨楠的遭遇并非孤例，反映出当前这一市场中存在值得警惕的乱象。基于家长和考生对“上好大学”的执念，一些机构以专业之名行“收割”牟利之实。\n艾媒咨询最新报告显示，2025年中国高考志愿填报市场付费规模预计达10.9亿元，超九成考生愿借助专业服务规划志愿。然而，当前的高考志愿填报市场，短时间内，大量从业人员涌入，市场良莠不齐，“水分”很大。\n此前据新京报报道，有的志愿填报辅导机构急于扩充业务，快速招募所谓高考志愿填报规划师后，仅简单培训一些“话术”就安排上岗；有的机构在社交平台引流，提供实际辅导时却“货不对板”，服务水平大打折扣。\n而一些机构的“业务”之所以被家长和考生抢购一空，乃至能卖爆，除了其包装话术光鲜亮丽、家长普遍存在焦虑心理等客观因素外，还在于其利用了家长容易陷入的认知误区：一是将复杂的人生规划简化为技术性操作，二是将学业决策权让渡给所谓的机构“专业人士”。\n除了“花得不值”，更值得警惕的是，一些机构的营销话术可能还会带来严重的误导。例如，一些机构用所谓“冲稳保”策略包装投机心理，可能会影响考生在填报志愿时做出不符合其真实水平的非理性抉择；还有网站自称掌握内部大数据，能“精准定位院校”“一分不浪费”等。对此，教育部曾表示，市面上的机构或个人并不掌握任何特殊的内部信息，夸大宣传是这类网站和人员一贯招揽客户的手段。\n这说明，这些志愿填报机构使用的分析系统与教育部门公开的志愿填报辅助系统并无本质区别。同时也意味着，这类机构尽管以AI等“技术手段”来包装自己，但其本质上借助的仍是普通的辅助工具，并无多少“过人之处”。相反，一些不负责任的机构和规划师，其“规划实力”很可能不如家长和考生。\n志愿填报的终极目标是分数与学校及专业的匹配。但匹配是一个系统工程，需要各方用力。政策层面，各地需完善官方志愿填报系统。不久前，教育部发文要求，各地要持续完善本地志愿填报辅助系统，充分运用多种宣传媒介，通过专题讲座等方式，提升志愿填报服务普惠性、可及性、便捷性。这无疑有助于考生和家长正确填报志愿。\n对家庭而言，则需要建立理性认知，最关键的，是要掌握基础填报规则，这比依赖机构更重要。\n新高考方案实施以来，学生被赋予更多的自主选择权，高考志愿填报机构由此也有了更多商机。如果学生和家长把这种选择权放手交给这类机构，省事的同时也意味着风险。破除对志愿填报机构的迷信，在大量信息的搜集与对比中做出独立判断和审慎选择，才是志愿填报的靠谱做法。\n撰稿 / 辛河(媒体人)\n编辑 / 柯锐",
