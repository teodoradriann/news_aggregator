Con decreto della Direzione per gli incentivi alle imprese del Mimit – Ministero delle Imprese e del Made in Italy, guidato dal ministro Adolfo Urso (nella foto) –, sono stati finanziati ulteriori progetti pilota proposti dai soggetti responsabili di Patti Territoriali. Fra questi, uno riguarda la montagna modenese per 10 milioni di euro, destinati ad agevolazioni alle aziende e contributi agli enti locali volti a sviluppare il tessuto imprenditoriale territoriale, anche attraverso la sperimentazione di servizi innovativi.\nAl bando della Provincia di Modena, cui fanno capo i Patti territoriali, avevano partecipato i 18 comuni dell’Appennino, con progetti di sviluppo e mobilità sostenibile per la Valle del Panaro, la Valle del Dolo e del Dragone e la Via Vandelli. Il progetto pilota della provincia di Modena è arrivato fra i primi 10 su oltre 150 presentati. Una parte dei progetti riguarda i privati per la valorizzazione delle risorse naturali, culturali e della competitività del sistema produttivo, in relazione alle potenzialità di sviluppo economico dell’area interessata. A questo punto la Provincia procederà con un bando di gara europeo attraverso il quale individuerà il partner tecnico e inizierà la gestione dei patti e a la preparazione dei progetti veri e propri.\nI lavori potrebbero già iniziare la prossima primavera. La durata della procedura è di cinque anni per la rendicontazione.\nw.b.\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos R. H. Badajoz Jueves, 15 de agosto 2024, 23:03 Necesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Opciones para compartir El Badajoz B disputaba este jueves el Trofeo Ferias y Fiestas 2024 de Villar del Rey, un triangular entre el equipo blanquinegro, el cuadro local y el Alburquerque donde el fútbol pasó a un segundo plano. En el choque entre los pacenses y el Alburquerque el jugador del Badajoz B Javier Ocaña cayó lesionado y todo apuntaba a una lesión grave. El silencio se hizo en el Estadio Municipal Las Crucitas de Villar del Rey y lo peor fue, dicen, la tardanza en llegar de la ambulancia, lo que provocó las quejas en redes de los asistentes. El CD Badajoz emitió un comunicado poco después indicando que su jugador había sufrido una lesión en la pierna izquierda, a la espera de dar un diagnóstico más preciso, aunque sin mencionar algún retraso en la atención médica como sí hicieran otras cuentas afines al club extremeño. En un segundo comunicado, el Badajoz anunció que Julio Ocaña tenía una rotura abierta de peroné y que iba a ser intervenido en el Hospital Universitario de Badajoz, deseándole además ánimo y una pronta recuperación.

    "text": "Case dismissed over plans to build new men's prison near Harrisburg\nA [Lincoln County](https://ujs.sd.gov/Circuit_Court/Default.aspx) judge dismissed a lawsuit over the [Department of Corrections’](https://doc.sd.gov/) plans to build a men’s prison near Harrisburg.\nAt the heart of the lawsuit is whether new state law trumps an existing local government’s law.\nThe suit was filed last year by the [Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion](https://nopelincoln.com/about/) – or NOPE – group and a few other individuals who own property adjacent to the proposed prison site. NOPE claimed the state needed to request a conditional use permit as required by [Lincoln County law](https://lincolncountysd.org/186/Planning-Zoning).\nThe Department of Corrections argued the state does not have to abide by local governmental law under [South Dakota’s constitutional right](https://sdsos.gov/2023SouthDakotaConstitution20220124.pdf) to sovereign immunity.\nThe DOC also argued that [House Bill 1017](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24675) passed in March 2023 preempts the county’s zoning law.\n[HB 1017](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24675) immediately appropriated funds to go towards the planning and construction of the new prison. In that law, the DOC was authorized to purchase land for the new site.\n[In October 2023](https://www.sdpb.org/news/2023-10-06/state-buys-land-for-prison-to-replace-sioux-falls-penitentiary) the DOC Secretary Kellie Wasko used the appropriated funding to buy state-owned land between Canton and Harrisburg for almost $8 million.\n[Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Mammenga](https://www.sdpb.org/news-and-information/2021-08-10/noem-appoints-mammenga-as-judge-for-south-dakotas-2nd-circuit-court) dismissed the case based on the grounds that Lincoln County’s zoning laws do not apply to the DOC.\n[Judge Mammenga wrote in her opinion](https://www.keloland.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2024/10/41CIV23-000877_MEMORANDUM-DECISION.pdf) “a county by its very nature is a legislative creation, and therefore seemingly lacks authority to preempt state law.”\nShe also said the need for the creation of a new prison likely out balances the surrounding landowners’ interests.",

    "title": "With war raging in Gaza, Christmas is effectively cancelled in Bethlehem",
    "text": "Church bells echo through the labyrinth-like streets of Bethlehem. With Christmas approaching, the city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank should be teeming with visitors. But this year, it is almost deserted.\nLocal leaders made the decision last month to scale back festivities in solidarity with the Palestinian population﻿, as heavy fighting raged between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s air and ground offensive, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza and nearly 85% of the strip’s total population has been displaced.\nThe war was sparked by Hamas’ terror attack on October 7 on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage.\nMany here have ties to Gaza through loved ones and friends, and a sense of misery has fallen upon the city revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus Christ.\nDecorations that once adorned neighborhoods have been removed. The parades and religious celebrations have been canceled. In the city center, the traditional enormous Christmas tree of Manger Square is conspicuously absent.\nTraveling into Bethlehem, about eight kilometers south of Jerusalem, isn’t ordinarily an easy journey. The Israeli-built West Bank barrier restricts movement, as do the various checkpoints leading in and out of the city. It’s only got worse since Hamas’ brazen attack.\nSince October 7, Israel has restricted movement in Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank, with military checkpoints allowing access in and out, impacting Palestinians trying to get to work.\nThe occupied territory has also experienced a surge in violence, with at least 300 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n“My son asked me why there’s no Christmas tree this year, I don’t know how to explain it,” Ali Thabet tells CNN.\nHe and his family live in Al Shawawra, a Palestinian village near Bethlehem, and visit each Christmas “because our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship.”\nHe explains: “We join them in their celebrations, and they also join us in our celebrations. But this year’s holiday season is very bad.”\nWalking down the cobble-stone streets, the impact of the conflict is evident.\nBusinesses were banking on a busy festive period after suffering through the hardships and travel restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic. But without the usual crowds of tourists and the faithful, many of the hotels, shops and restaurants have shuttered.\nBethlehem’s economy depends on pilgrims and tourism, explains third-generation shop owner Rony Tabash, who stands outside his store waiting for customers who will never arrive. Souvenirs and intricately carved olive wood carvings of the nativity scene sit on shelves gathering dust. Tabash’s store is one of the handful to remain open, out of a wish to support the skilled artisans that delicately make his merchandise.\nTabash brings his father with him to the shop each day to get him out of the house. His grandfather opened the store back in 1927 and this place, along with the square and its famous church, have become “part of our heart.” “We’ve never seen Christmas like this,” he continues. “Since three months, honestly, we don’t have one sale. I don’t want to keep my father at home. I don’t want to give up hope.”\nEven the Church of the Nativity – which became the first World Heritage site in the Palestinian territories in 2012 – is largely empty. In a normal year, queues of hundreds would snake around the car park outside with pilgrims patiently waiting to enter its grotto, considered since the 2nd Century to be the exact location of Christ’s birth. A 14-pointed silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born.\nIn the 4th Century, Emperor Constantine founded a church on the site, which was destroyed in the year 529, only to be replaced by larger structures, which form the basis of the church today.\nInside, it would usually be standing room only. But this year, the fighting in Gaza has changed everything. Now, you can practically hear a pin drop.\n“I have never seen it like this,” says Father Spiridon Sammour, a Greek Orthodox priest at the Church of the Nativity.\n“Christmas is joy, love and peace. We have no peace. We have no joy,” he says solemnly. “It is out of our hands, and we pray for the leaders who will make the decisions [all] over the world to God to help them, give them his light to make peace here and all over the world.
