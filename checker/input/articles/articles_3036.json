    "title": "Argentina’s trade union federations call for national strike on January 24 - Buenos Aires Herald",
    "text": "Argentina’s trade union federation called for a national strike for January 24 to protest the [mega-decree President Javier Milei issued last week](https://buenosairesherald.com/politics/milei-decrees-sweeping-economic-deregulation-and-privatization-measures). The federation, called the General Confederation of Labor (CGT by its Spanish acronym), will be marching en masse to Congress, according to a communiqué released on Thursday. “This is in response to a decree that is illegal and unconstitutional,” Héctor Daer, one of the three CGT leaders, said at a rally in the federation’s headquarters. The CGT encompasses nearly two out of three unionized workers in Argentina and has three leaders: Daer (Healthcare Union), Carlos Acuña (Dredging and Signaling Union), and Juan Carlos Schmidt (Valets Union). Two other trade federations, Argentina’s Workers Central and the Autonomous Argentine Workers Central Central, joined the CGT’s call for a national strike. The informal worker’s union (UTEP, by its Spanish initials) will also join the protest. The last time the CGT called for a national strike was in 2019, when they protested against then-President Mauricio Macri’s austerity measures and the record-high debt he had taken out with the International Monetary Fund. “There is neither a need nor an urgency for so many articles that turn the administrative matrix of our country upside down,” Daer added. The union leader also said the decree targets workers’ individual and collective rights, including the healthcare system. He said that the mega-decree forced the CGT to march on Wednesday after filing a complaint calling for the unconstitutionality of the norm. The legal presentation made by the union federation is not the only complaint that has been filed against the mega-decree — lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez filed one calling the project a “covert constitutional reform” and a “coup d’etat.” The decree [ will impact tariffs](https://buenosairesherald.com/politics/what-does-mileis-massive-presidential-decree-actually-say) and healthcare while completely deregulating the economy, overturning laws that protect workers, including the right to strike, and limiting benefits like severance pay and maternity leave. “This is a clear fund transfer to a small sector of society, which has the most and earns the most,” Daer said. Daer also called CGT delegations nationwide to a plenary meeting on January 10 to develop strategies, as well as the march on January 24 to Congress to support senators and deputies that reject the mega-decree. The union leader added that, while they were marching on Wednesday, they found out that [the so-called “omnibus” bill](https://buenosairesherald.com/politics/milei-sends-massive-bill-calling-for-power-to-legislate-privatize-public-companies) had been sent to Congress. The bill aims to give Milei the power to legislate without having to go through Congress during his tenure. “We would be facing a president who would have the sum of all public authority for his entire term in office,” Daer said. If approved, the bill would also give Milei the power to privatize 41 state-owned companies and to transfer the Sustainability Guarantee Fund (FGS), a sovereign investment fund that partly finances retirement pensions, to the Executive Branch. “The country is not for sale,” Daer said, quoting a chant that was heard in [the cacerolazos all over Argentina](https://buenosairesherald.com/politics/spontaneous-protests-erupted-after-mileis-unprecedented-deregulation-decree) after the decree was first announced.",

    "text": "Photo: ivanastar/E+ | fotostorm/E+/Getty Images\nThis Christmas is definitely one for the books for a family in North Carolina after their toddler opened the entire family's gifts in the middle of the night while everyone was asleep.\nMost young children on Christmas Eve try to get a peek of the presents under the tree, but one toddler took his curiosity a step further and decided to unwrap his entire family's Christmas gift haul at 3 a.m. while his household was sleeping, per NBC News . It wasn't until Scott and Katie Reintgen were awoken on Christmas Day to their 3-year-old asking for scissors that they realized what had happened and discovered the \"terrifying\" scene.\n\"The 3-year-old had found his Spider-Man web shooters, and so he wanted scissors to cut them out,\" Scott told the outlet on Tuesday (December 26). He also shared a photo of the aftermath of his middle child's midnight mayhem on X (formerly Twitter ) .\nThe Reintgens have three children, ages 6, 3 and 1, so there were quite a few presents under the tree; but that didn't hold the 3-year-old back. Katie said \"the midnight perpetrator\" opened \"literally everything, from the tiniest eraser to the biggest box\" that the couple had wrapped the night before because he didn't want his family to be confused.\n\"He wanted us to be able to see our presents so we knew what they were,\" said Scott. \"I think he legitimately just felt that he was doing a service to everyone. He will not do it again next year, we hope.\"\nWhile the toddler may not remember his Christmas impatience, his parents will make sure he won't ever forget it. Scott even joked on X it will be a story they tell when their little one grows up and gets married.\n\"Luckily my wife repackaged enough of the presents to stop the villain origin story for the 6 year old,\" he wrote. \"We, on the other hand, are sipping coffee and plotting to tell this story at his wedding.\"\nThe Reintgens said their oldest child is a \"rule-follower\" that would be confused by someone who \"would just go down and open all the presents,\" so they had to act quickly to ensure his Christmas went smoothly. Katie tried to salvage as much of the ripped wrapping paper as she could to repackage the gifts while Scott put the kids back to bed, making sure to put the presents on the mantle and out of the reach of the 3-year-old.\nIn a follow-up video to his original X post, Scott added that he and his wife aren't mad, calling their 3-year-old a \"good kid\" and adding that the story is one they'll tell \"for the rest of our lives.\"",

    "title": "Closed Season: A boost for sustainable fisheries",
    "text": "In a landmark move, three West African countries: Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana have joined forces to protect their marine resources by implementing comprehensive closed seasons for their entire fisheries sub-sectors. This coordinated effort marks a significant step towards establishing a regional fishery closed season, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the fisheries.\nBenin is observing the closed season in the artisanal fisheries sub-sector from July 8 to August 8, 2024. Côte d’Ivoire is observing the closed season in the artisanal fisheries sub-sector from July 1 to August 31, 2024, and has also extended the ban to lagoons and lakes.\nGhana is observing the closed season in the artisanal and inshore fisheries sub-sectors from July 1 to August 31, 2024. Additionally, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are enforcing fishing bans in the industrial trawl sector from July 1 to August 31, 2024.\nThe closed season offers a welcome break for fisher folk, providing an opportunity to recharge, bond with family and friends, and perform essential maintenance work on gear, equipment, and boats. However, the temporary ban on fishing activities can also lead to fish scarcity, economic hardship, and potential illegal fishing.\nThe Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) and the Feed the Future Ghana Fisheries Recovery Activity (GFRA) are proactively addressing these challenges. Through the Livelihood Empowerment Programme, they are providing alternative livelihood support to fisher folk, including:\nTraining and capacity building in alternative livelihood skills Provision of equipment and tools Support for business development and market access Mentorship and coaching This initiative aims to support 8,000 beneficiaries this year, up from 5,000 in 2023. By providing alternative livelihood opportunities, MoFAD and GFRA are helping to reduce economic hardship, promote economic independence, and ensure a resilient and sustainable future for Ghana’s fisheries.\nThe closed season is a crucial step towards sustainable fisheries management, and the efforts of MoFAD and GFRA demonstrate their commitment to supporting fisher folk and their communities. By working together, we can ensure a thriving fisheries sector that benefits both people and the planet.",

    "text": "Un par de semanas atrás, el gobernador chavista del estado Anzoátegui, Luis Marcano, anunció el “Reto Anzoátegui te Enamora”, en el que se repartirán 30 mil dólares en premios a quienes participen tomándose fotos en cuatro lugares específicos de la entidad.\nCorresponsalía lapatilla.com\nAnte esto, las reacciones de los dirigentes sindicales del sector salud y educación no se hicieron esperar. Consideran una burla que se estén haciendo “concursos absurdos”, cuando el hospital Luis Razetti de Barcelona sigue con notables carencias y hay escuelas en las que los niños se sientan en el piso, porque no hay pupitres, sin contar los problemas salariales de los maestros.\n“Así como hay recursos para impulsar el turismo, también debe tener para honrar a los educadores, que pedimos al menos una bonificación en diciembre ante la ausencia de una contratación colectiva, pero no recibimos nada”, expresó Maira Marín, presidenta del Sindicato Venezolano de Maestros (Sinvema) en la entidad.\nLa vocera señaló que hay más de 2.000 docentes que siguen en nómina, además de los empleados administrativos y obreros, junto a más de 5.000 jubilados, que siguen esperando algún beneficio económico para compensar los pobres salarios que devengan.\n“Hay 1.374 planteles en el estado y la mayoría sigue con problemas de agua, luz e infraestructura en general. Es una lástima que hoy estén en condiciones de decadencia y deterioro también en dotación, pues hay niños que ven clases en el suelo. Señor gobernador, la educación merece ser atendida y usted tiene los recursos propios del Estado para hacerlo”, enfatizó.\nHospital Razetti\nEdisson Hernández, coordinador general del Movimiento de Trabajadores de la Salud (Motrasalud), criticó que el mandatario estadal “vive en el país de las maravillas”, pues “está gastando el dinero del pueblo en premios absurdos, cuando debería invertirlos en el hospital (Luis) Razetti”.\n“Acuérdese de la morgue, que tenemos casi cinco años exigiendo que reparen las cavas y los trabajadores se están enfermando. Acuérdese del área de observación de la emergencia de adultos, que empezaron unos trabajos de reparación, pero van a paso de tortuga y no le han hecho más nada. Acuérdese, señor gobernador, que el área de Rayos X tiene dos años que no funciona esperando nuevos equipos”, manifestó.\nEl también delegado de prevención del principal nosocomio de la entidad afirmó que el área de psiquiatría en el piso 8 lleva cuatro años cerrado y que siguen con deficiencias en la dotación de insumos como tapabocas, lo que los preocupa por la ola de enfermedades respiratorias que se ha registrado últimamente en el estado.\nHernández agregó que el cuarto de archivo de historias médicas luce cada vez peor por las filtraciones y la humedad, pero tampoco ha sido tomado en cuenta para brindar una solución.\n“Le pedimos al gobernador que se enamore del Hospital Razetti e invierta ese dinero en él para que sea la envidia de las clínicas del estado”, finalizó.",

    "title": "A nationwide strike in Argentina poses major test to Milei’s economic ‘shock therapy’ | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",
    "text": "Argentina’s largest labor union grouping on Wednesday held a nationwide general strike to protest President Javier Milei’s shock economic agenda.\nThe strike comes just 45 days after the right-wing leader took office, making it the fastest action of its kind into the term of a new Argentina government.\nThousands of workers took to the streets after a mobilization called by the opposition aligned Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT), the largest and most influential union in the country, and other union forces.\nThe strike represents a significant test for Milei, who has announced sweeping measures to deregulate Latin America’s third-largest economy.\nAnalysts said the general strike was unlikely to have a significant impact on Milei’s policies in the near term but warned the potential for the labor union’s movement to grow in both size and potency could become a serious disruptor of economic activity.\nArgentina’s government has not responded favorably to the strike action. Milei’s administration has reportedly said it will dock a day’s pay from each striking public servant, and established an anonymous toll-free line for people to report “threats and pressure” on workers to stay away from their jobs.\n“The general strike is more of a political test for the labour unions than for Milei,” Jimena Blanco, head of Americas at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC via email.\n“Regardless of attendance, the strike caters to the unions’ own support base and, at this stage, is not representative of wider social sentiment. However, it has the potential to grow in the future as the impacts of the economic shock plan become palpable.”\nBlanco said history shows that during Argentina’s hyperinflation crisis in the late 1980s, the Peronist-aligned unions held 13 strikes, eventually bringing an early end to the Raúl Alfonsín’s government.\n“And while we do not expect the pursuit of a similar strategy, the relentless use of labour action to pressure the executive means mobilisations could become a serious disruptor of economic activity and suppress potential investor appetite, particularly if they turn violent and result in the damage of assets,” she added.\nThe left-leaning Peronist movement was founded by Juan Peron, who first became president in 1946. Peronist candidate Sergio Massa conceded defeat to Milei in the country’s presidential run-off late last year.\nEconomic crisis\nArgentina is once again in the grip of a profound economic crisis.\nThe purchasing power of Argentinians has been ravaged by an annual inflation rate of more than 211%, its highest level in 32 years, while two in five citizens now live in poverty after decades of financial mismanagement.\nMilei has said there is no alternative to his proposed “shock therapy” to remedy the situation. He has announced plans to dollarize the economy, abolish the country’s central bank and privatize the pension system.\nLast week, Argentina’s libertarian president called on business and political leaders to reject socialism and instead embrace “free enterprise capitalism” to bring an end to world poverty.\nNicolas Saldias, senior analyst for Latin America at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the unwillingness of the highly partisan unions to call a strike during the last administration had likely sapped their credibility with the wider public.\n“As a result, I think that many Argentinians will not interpret the strike favourably as it is too soon and the union leaders are extremely unpopular with the wider public,” Saldias told CNBC via email.\n“The government was wise to leverage its honeymoon period to fast-track its reforms and it is making important progress on its legislative agenda as there is still goodwill among non-Peronist parties,” he added.\nHowever, Saldias said that if the economy fails to recover quickly enough, subsequent strikes could have more of an impact on Milei’s agenda.\nSource: CNBC\n2024-01-26 hellenicshippingnews...",
