    "text": "Six mois après l'explosion du dépôt de carburants de Conakry qui a fait au moins 25 morts et des centaines de maisons endommagées, les sinistrés demandent leur indemnisation. Faute d'accord avec les autorités, des habitants du quartier populaire de Coronthie, le plus touché par la déflagration, ont décidé d'entamer la reconstruction par leurs propres moyens. Système D et solidarité sont les maîtres-mots de ce chantier à deux pas de la présidence et des ministères.\n« Ici, c'est ma maison » : Mamoudou Cifo Kétouré est en train de rénover la petite bâtisse. Deux pièces ont été inondées par les dernières pluies. « Il y a de l'eau parce que justement ce n'est pas encore couvert. C'est pour cela que les menuisiers sont en train de travailler », explique-t-il.\nCe jeune professeur de philosophie est le président du comité des sinistrés des hydrocarbures de Coronthie . « Nous sommes dans la zone la plus touchée, située à 500 mètres du dépôt d'hydrocarbures. Ici, nous avons 55 concessions. Jusqu'à présent, il y a des familles qui n'ont pas réussi à poser une seule brique. Nous sommes en train de faire nos maisons nous-mêmes et à nos propres frais. C'est un quartier populaire, un quartier très pauvre. En réalité, les circonstances ont fini par montrer aux populations qu'elles doivent se lever elles-mêmes pour leur propre sort. C'est ce qui les a amenées à chercher des moyens, même en ayant des dettes, des crédits pour venir faire leur maison », continue-t-il.\n% Mamoudou porte aujourd'hui les revendications de tout son quartier : « Nous demandons l'indemnisation. Le deuxième point est la restitution complète de tous les dons. » Au lendemain de la catastrophe, les dons ont afflué dans un élan de solidarité nationale. Mais selon Mamoudou, ils ne sont pas parvenus en totalité aux sinistrés. « Une chose reste claire quand même : ce que nous faisons est provisoire et en attendant le dédommagement parce que c'est la loi qui l'exige », termine-t-il.\nL'État a débloqué 800 000 euros pour reloger les sinistrés. Cette solution n'a pas été discutée avec les habitants, dénonce Mamoudou Cifo Kétouré. Aujourd'hui, Coronthie est dans une impasse.\nCliquez ici pour lire l'article sur le site de RFI.",

    "title": "Pokémon Legends: Z-A Is What The Franchise Needs",
    "text": "Summary - Pokémon Legends: Arceus stands out with an impressive Metascore of 83, while Scarlet and Violet score lower at 71 on the Nintendo Switch. - Arceus reinvents the typical Pokémon game with a focus on the Pokédex and world history, shaking up the series convention. - Z-A has the potential to refine Arceus and Pokémon X and Y , introducing new mechanics like city building and improving gameplay. Which [Pokémon](https://www.cbr.com/tag/pokemon/) game is the worst and why will differ between anyone you ask, but when it comes to reviews, the Switch era has had a rough time. Of Pokémon's mainline Nintendo Switch releases, the game with the highest Metascore is Pokémon Legends: Arceus with an 83, and the game with the lowest is Violet at 71. Two of the Switch pairs, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, as well as Scarlet and Violet, are currently the lowest-scoring main series Pokémon games on Metacritic. Though the Switch era of Pokémon has been swimming in controversy, one game managed to shock players and critics by shaking the series up: Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Arceus was a surprisingly fun reinvention of the typical Pokémon game, if technically unimpressive even by the Switch's standards. While it wasn't the first game to ditch the Gym Challenge, its focus on the Pokédex and development of the Pokémon world's history made it stand out. After 25 years of defeating the Champion to become the very best, Arceus ditched the Pokémon League altogether in favor of catching 'em all. Now that Pokémon Legends: Z-A has been announced, the second Legends game has the potential to refine the best parts of Arceus and Pokémon X and Y to create [a new foundation for Pokémon games going forward](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-mainline-games-legends-arceus-gameplay-new-standard/). How Hisui Succeeded Where Paldea Failed [ ](/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-largest-missed-opportunities/) The Paradox Pokémon were fancy new additions to the roster in the Gen IX games Scarlet & Violet, but how could they have been even better? [ The Biggest Missed Opportunities of the Paradox Pokémon ](/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-largest-missed-opportunities/) Scarlet and Violet are notorious for presentation and gameplay issues. Arceus is a more stable product, but it also managed to handle exploration better than the Paldea games despite not having an open world like them. While Hisui is far from a bustling society, the narrative justifies the lack of NPCs outside of Jubilife Village by setting the game during Hisui's colonization. The more streamlined system that lets the player catch Pokémon without engaging them in a battle first makes filling the Pokédex more fun: while the player is free to approach the Pokémon in a standard encounter and lower their HP, they can also try sneaking up on it and using non-battle items to distract or stun it before throwing the ball. Scarlet and Violet had overworld encounters where players could sneak up on Pokémon too, but the need to switch into a battle to catch the Pokémon would bring the momentum of open-world roaming to a screeching halt. Paldea is still fun to explore, but Hisui provides a much smoother experience. If it makes things easier for Game Freak and means the return of Arceus' catching system, having multiple separate but large maps rather than one singular huge map would be a great choice for Z-A. When it came to battling, some of Arceus' greatest moments were the Noble Pokémon battles. Serving as Arceus' closest replacement for the Gym Challenge, the Noble Pokémon were bosses that didn't just test the player's Pokémon, but the player themselves. Instead of facing off against them in a turn-based battle, the player would have to dodge the Noble's attacks in real-time while throwing special medicine to subdue them. There's occasionally a chance to send out a Pokémon to try and wear out the Noble a little faster, but most of the experience would involve dodging the angry Pokémon's attacks. The Noble Pokémon were fun to take on, but [the difficulty spike that accompanied them](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-games-gens-difficulty-ranked/) was sometimes more of a design issue than a player skill issue. Sometimes the arenas weren't wide enough to easily dodge in, or the player only being able to take a few hits made it too easy to lose. Z-A could have its own version of Noble Pokémon battles, but also revamp the arenas and give the ability to upgrade the player character's HP to make things more manageable. What Z-A Can Improve Upon From Arceus [ ](/young-pokemon-trainer-downside/) The life of a Pokémon Trainer has often been depicted as glamorous and full of adventure. However, one manga showed that this isn't always the case. [ This Pokémon Manga Shows The Dark Side Of Becoming A Child Pokémon Trainer ](/young-pokemon-trainer-downside/) There's plenty of speculation on what Z-A will take from Arceus, but since Arceus is the only Legends game so far, there's not a lot of solid precedent to base Z-A theories on. A pattern isn't a pattern if it only happens once. While it'd be great to see things like the boss battles and catching system from Arceus return in Z-A, it'd be even better if traditional series mechanics like abilities and online battling returned with them. Imagine the potential of Arceus' strong and agile style moves combined with abilities and Mega Evolution online; the meta would either collapse or ascend from the potential new strategies. If Game Freak decides against making Z-A a more competitive game, there's still plenty of potential for it in other areas. The battle system in Arceus was fine, but there was a much bigger focus on catching Pokémon. Z-A might follow in its footsteps by putting more of the spotlight on a non-battle mechanic. Maybe the focus will be on filling the Pokédex again, but it could be something completely different. What if Contests make a major return since they were referenced at the end of Arceus' \"Daybreak\" update? What if they bring in completely new mechanics like resource management and city building? It's the \"Lumiose City Redevelopment Plan,\" after all. Whether Z-A takes place in the past or the future, something major is being built in Lumiose City. It'd be the perfect chance to bring in a city building mechanic. Of course, less can be more. If the game steers too far and puts too much investment into something that Pokémon isn't known for, it could result in a disjointed gameplay experience. Pokémon is in a precarious position, balancing right on the line between \"too safe and stale\" and \"too risky and different.\" However, the nature of Pokémon as hyper-intelligent superpowered animals that live alongside humans allows for them to be used in many different roles without being too jarring. Spin-off games like Pokémon Café ReMix and the Detective Pikachu duology showcase this with many different Pokémon who don't battle. The two main anime series are even better — Orla using a Metagross to help with her mechanic duties and Murdock using his Alcremie when he cooks in [Pokémon Horizons: The Series](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-horizons-rising-volts-explained/) are recent examples. Picking Up On Old Plot Points [ ](/pokemon-game-for-older-audiences/) Pokémon has captured the hearts of kids for over a quarter-century, but what would it look like if they made a T-rated Pokémon game? [ How Would a Pokémon Game for Older Audiences Look? ](/pokemon-game-for-older-audiences/) One of the most exciting things about Z-A is its return to Kalos. Pokémon X and Y were very impressive graphically for the mainline games' first venture into 3D and introduced the beloved Mega Evolution mechanic, but they were criticized for feeling unfinished and being much easier than previous games. It wasn't that they were glitchy or bad-looking, but rather that there were elements that were never explored in much depth or ever followed up on. [AZ, the Pokémon War](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-x-y-dark-lore/), and Zygarde were the biggest missed opportunities in Kalos. While AZ's story plays a major role in Kalos' history, it feels so disconnected from the main plot that most people forgot about it. Zygarde was a Legendary Pokémon meant to round out a trio with Xerneas and Yveltal, who were on the boxes of their own games but never got a game of their own to headline. This was especially egregious since Zygarde was a major focus in the Pokémon the Series: XY arc of the anime. Z-A, from its name alone, can be assumed to feature both AZ and Zygarde in some capacity: AZ is Z-A obviously backward, and Zygarde comes to mind because it's a Kalos game that has a \"Z\" in the title. If Z-A decides to go into Kalos' backstory like Arceus did with Sinnoh, then AZ's reign and the Pokémon War would be a goldmine of storytelling to pull from. In X and Y, all the player is told about the Pokémon War is that AZ, the old king of Kalos, used a weapon powered by the box Legendary and the lives of dead Pokémon to first bring his Floette back to life and then to end the war by causing a calamity. What caused the war besides \"people suck\" is never explained, but it must have been bad if the king's own Pokémon was forcibly drafted. Could Zygarde have had something to do with it? Most of its Pokédex entries describe it as some kind of guardian of the ecosystem, so after AZ used the weapon, did Zygarde do anything? These are all great questions that the player could witness the answers to rather than just be told about. [ ](/is-mewtwo-strongest-pokemon/) Mewtwo was known for being Pokémon's strongest creature at the franchise's start, but how does it compare to new Legendaries, such as Arceus? [ Is Mewtwo Really The Most Powerful Pokémon? ](/is-mewtwo-strongest-pokemon/) With only one trailer and an X post to pull from, there's still a lot of mystery surrounding Pokémon Legends: Z-A. If the whole game takes place in Lumiose City, what's the main goal going to be? Does it take place in the past or the future or does it switch between both? Will that one Hex Maniac ever reveal what she meant when she said the player isn't \"the one?\" (The answer to the last one is \"probably not.\") With hindsight and taking more time to come out than the Paldea games took to release after Arceus, Z-A has a lot of potential to be the best Pokémon game on the Switch. The real thing that they need to bring back, though, is Kalos' level of character customization. Time to let the player be the very best on the fashion runway again.

    "text": "Fiji 19-15 Ireland\nIreland's chances of securing an Olympic medal in the rugby sevens are over as they were beaten 19-15 by Fiji in the quarter-finals at the Stade de France.\nFacing the Olympic champions in their last-eight clash, having failed to top their group, Ireland lost a second-half lead to lose by four points in Paris.\nIt took just 30 seconds for Fiji to make it a perfect start as Iosefo Baleiwairki handed off Niall Comerford before racing through from the half-way line to touch down under the posts.\nIreland looked for a response and Raisuqe Josaia’s high tackle on Zac Ward allowed them to kick to the corner and look to work an opportunity from the line-out.\nA poor set-piece, but it resulted in an Ireland scrum that was moved quickly out to the right. Chay Mullins then cut back inside to power over and touch down – the conversion was missed, however, which meant that a two-point gap remained approaching half time.\nBut Ireland were quickly back in possession and looked to hit Fiji once again with the reigning champions’ ill-discipline leading to consecutive infringements.\nAnother Ireland scrum from a central possession allowed James Topping’s side to exploit the space on the left and Mullins was there once more to power over and force the ball to ground.\nAnother conversion kick missed as Ireland led by three at the break.\nBut Ireland came out with all guns blazing to start the second half and their pressure eventually paid dividends with Ward getting over in the corner to open up an eight-point lead.\nAnother Fiji knock-on handed Ireland possession once more, however, they were unable to capitalise, and it sparked their opponents into life as they went the length of the field with Joji Nasova touching down.\nAnd then disaster, as Ireland made a mess of the re-start, and a knock-on appeared to be missed by the officials, allowing Waisea Nacuqu to race in to put Fiji in front 19-15 with just one and a half minutes on the clock.\nIreland went in search of a deciding score as they opted for touch to work a set-piece opportunity, however, despite prolonging the game for three additional minutes they were unable to break through as Fiji progressed to meet Australia.\nFrance will meet South Africa in the other semi-final on Saturday, with the gold medal to be decided later that evening.\nIreland will now contest the fifth to eighth place play-offs, where the United States will be their initial opponents on Saturday, before a clash against either New Zealand or Argentina.\nFrance, beaten by Fiji in their earlier group game, powered past Argentina 26-14 in front of an enthralled home crowd.\nLes Bleus stunned the Pumas – bronze medallists at Tokyo 2020 – to take a 21-0 interval lead through an Andy Timo try and Aaron Grandidier Nkanang's brace. Rayan Rebbadj added three conversions.\nArgentina fought back as Rodrigo Isgro and Marcos Moneta touched down, but Dupont, the former World Rugby men’s 15s player of the year, came on as a replacement to settle the contest with a late score.\nNew Zealand, silver medallists at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, were surprise quarter-final casualties as South Africa reversed the Pool result to beat them 14-7.\nAustralia coasted to an 18-0 victory over the United States.",

    "text": "2023-12-24 11:52:06 You have to imagine Vienna at the end of the 18th century as a gigantic musical circus. Full of artists. They came to the Danube from all over Kakania, from Europe, which at that time was musically as good as the whole world. One was even better at juggling notes, keys and strings than the other (or at least he thought so). They threw balls to each other, copied numbers, varied them, mixed the languages they brought with them from Bohemia, France and Italy into an Esperanto that is now called classical. One likes to imagine that people walked through the streets of the city center, which at that time could easily be crossed in less than an hour, and music from sonatas, quartets and symphonies emanated from every other palace onto the street. Hardly any of the virtuosos or composers became rich. They were struggling. A few stayed. Many were lost in the world – and later in the shadow of the big three – Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven. also read Occasionally, as in the Beethoven year, they are conjured up to the general astonishment and then their works demonstrate that none of the three geniuses fell from heaven and that you only half understand them unless you also hear names like Kozeluch, Eberl, Hummel , Clementi and Abel. However, Joseph Johann Baptist Woelfl, who would be celebrating his 250th birthday on Christmas Eve, has so far missed all the excitement of discovery – despite the commitment of the Vienna Woelfl Society and its Bonn branch (Woelfl has never been to Bonn). Of Woelfl’s almost 700 surviving works (ten operas, more than sixty sonatas, a good dozen symphonies), there are just three albums on Spotify (with quartets and piano sonatas). He could grab a Tredezime Woelfl, born in Salzburg in the house of Johann Michael Haydn, grew up with the Mozarts as a family member, so to speak, and was taught by Nannerl and Leopold, sponsored by Wolfgang Amadeus, who was 17 years his senior. This Woelfl towered over the big three by a good twenty centimeters, and had huge hands ( he could play a tredecime, i.e. thirteen tones).

Woelfl (who still spelled himself Wölfl until the start of his international career) had made his debut on the violin at the age of seven, then completed rigorous, long-term studies at the Salzach and then, in two years, trained himself all the muscles necessary for highly virtuosic piano playing. In 1790 he came under the Viennese wing of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He recommended the 17-year-old to the court of Prince Michal Kleofas Oginski as a piano teacher – perhaps because Vienna was so full of promising music scorers and pianists. Woelfl set up his own business, helped invent the polonaise, and returned to Vienna a made man. The first operas were created for the theater by the “Magic Flute” librettist Emanuel Schikaneder. Woelfl’s reputation as a piano virtuoso continued to spread. In the winter of 1798/99 there was a legendary improvisation duel with Beethoven. Woelfl won the audience award, so to speak. Overall, the duel ended in a draw. The two very different fireheads remained friends. also read Beethoven stayed in Vienna, Woelfl went out into the world. Concerted in every city with a reasonably wealthy audience between Leipzig and Lübeck. Caused a sensation for years in Napoleonic Paris, where he is rumored to have taught Empress Josephine. Then he got stuck in London. On the tightrope between classic and romantic The impresarios fought over him. He gave at least three concerts a week. Haydn’s legendary agent Johann Peter Salomon ultimately signed him for life. However, that didn’t last long. On May 21, 1812, Woelfl died in the then posh London district of Marylebone. The funeral procession was long. Muzio Clementi, London’s other piano god, went along on the train. Woelfl, it is said, earned more money during his short life than Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven combined.

He shaped the British piano school like no other, apart from Clementi. Schubert, Chopin, Mendelssohn played him. His fame lasted until the end of the 19th century. Then – like for many bridgeheads between classical and romantic music – it was over. Which is a real shame. Woelfl, who was one of the last of the Mozart school and became a distinguished classicist in London, is (you can see for yourself for several hours on YouTube) a real charmer. A traditionalist who was still trained on the old Bach and has a tendency towards the closest melodic development. Not a revolutionary, not a firehead. A sensitive dancer on the tightrope between classical and romantic. An artist who knew exactly which balls to throw into the air.

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power in wake of Storm Gerrit The Met Office confirmed the worst of the conditions passed. Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",
