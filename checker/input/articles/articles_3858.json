    "text": "The state is helping families remove lead from their homes, free of charge LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - The state’s health department has a message for Mid-Michigan -- anyone living in a home built in the 1970′s needs to get it tested for lead, especially if they have children six and under. The City of Lansing said it’s helping families make sure they are living in lead safe homes. The number one source of lead poisoning in Michigan is lead-based paint in older homes, like the ones built before 1978. “I got my house tested for lead and a lot of lead was found inside of my home.” Shamika Deberry said she didn’t know there was lead in the pipes and paint in her home until her five-year-old daughter tested positive for lead during a routine check-up. Through state programs like, [ Lead Safe Lansing](https://www.lansingmi.gov/346/Lead-Safe-Lansing), Community Development Coordinator, Tyler Blakey said the city is removing lead from homes at no cost to the residents. He said “well this is something that we weren’t aware of whenever these houses were being built and lead-based paint was commonly used everywhere until it was outlawed in 1978. According to Blakey, “Lansing has a lot of older homes.” [70% of lead poisoned children in Ingham County are living in rental housing](https://health.ingham.org/health/maternal_and_child_health/lead_poisoning_prevention_program.php#:~:text=Ingham%20County%20Health%20Department,-Medical%20Health%20Officer&text=70%25%20of%20lead%20poisoned%20children,rental%20inspection%20or%20licensing%20programs.), according to the health department. Blakey said peeling or chalky paint are indicators of lead-based paint. Also in the county, lead clearance is not required as part of a rental inspection or licensing. “For pregnant women, [lead] can cause miscarriages and lower birth weight. And for children, it can cause lower IQ’s, developmental issues, and hearing impairment, speech disorders,” said Blakey. Through its [Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund](https://michigansaves.org/leadfund/), Michigan Saves offers free lead inspections, risk assessment, and a 50/50 cost sharing incentive to remove lead from your home. “Something that could be tough for homeowners to navigate so we’re glad to be here to help them navigate that process,” said Nishaat Killeen, Senior Project Manager at Michigan Saves. The Lead Safe Lansing Program offers grants to help remediate lead-based paint hazards in Lansing homes. This program is available to home owners and rental property owners who meet qualification criteria. Those who qualify can receive up to $16,000 for repairs designed to remediate lead-based paint hazards.

The military says 34 of them are dead.\nIsrael&apos;s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory&apos;s health ministry.",

    "text": "Semonza, Gillie, Mucciolo and Koziol Lead Ball State All-MAC Football Selections December 05, 2024 MUNCIE, Ind. – Redshirt freshman quarterback Kadin Semonza was the Mid-American Conference Freshman of the Year for the 2024 college football season, and senior Malcolm Gillie was the league's Special Teams Player of the Year as part of All-MAC football teams that were announced on Thursday. Jon Mucciolo and Tanner Koziol were other top Ball State honorees as part of All-MAC football teams named on Thursday. Semonza completed his first full college season while throwing for 2,904 yards and completing 64.4 percent of his passes. His 25 touchdown passes were the most by a Cardinals quarterback since NFL draft pick Keith Wenning threw 35 TDs in 2013. Gillie, a senior, was Ball State's only first-team selection, earning distinction as an All-MAC kickoff returner. His 25.6 yards per kickoff return were tops in the MAC and 11th nationally. Mucciolo, a grad student, was a second-team All-MAC honoree on the offensive line. He was a preseason All-MAC pick and a member of 247Sports' Transfer All-America Team last season. With Ethan Crowe and Taran Tyo, both third-team selections, Mucciolo helped guide the most experienced offensive line in the MAC. Ball State's most highly touted offensive star in 2024 was junior tight end Tanner Koziol whose 7.8 receptions per game ranked fourth in the country. Unfortunately, ahead of him in the national rankings, second, was Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin who garnered first team All-MAC honors. A highly regarded second-teamer, Koziol broke Ball State's single-season and career receptions records by a tight end. He finished the year with 94 catches for 839 yards. His 94 catches are fourth in Cardinals history by any receiver. Through three seasons, his 163 career receptions are ninth in Ball State history. Crowe and Tyo earned third-team selections while anchoring the veteran offensive line with Mucciolo. Crowe, a senior, earned his second All-MAC selection while Tyo, a redshirt sophomore, earned his first. Another third-team selection was junior wide receiver Cam Pickett whose breakout season followed two years of injury. His 49 catches and 528 yards both were second on the team to Koziol. Ball State's only defensive selection was senior rush linebacker Brandon Berger who had five sacks and led the Cardinals with nine QB hurries. Under the leadership of new head coach Mike Uremovich, season tickets for the 2025 Ball State football season are on sale now at an exclusive presale price.

    "title": "Japón sostiene que su misión ha llegado a la Luna, pero admite problemas técnicos preocupantes",
    "text": "Japón afirma que ha conseguido aterrizar con éxito su primera misión lunar. Pero el logro llega rodeado de muchas (quizás demasiadas) incógnitas como para arrancar las celebraciones. Según explican desde la agencia espacial japonesa (JAXA), la misión SLIM consiguió posarse sin problemas sobre la superficie lunar. Pero poco después de lograr este hito, una anomalía todavía no identificada puso en jaque los paneles solares de la nave y entorpeció las comunicaciones. Los responsables de la misión afirman que siguen “recopilando datos” para saber lo ocurrido. El módulo espacial funcionará durante unas horas con las baterías de reserva. Después, es posible que se apague. Queda la duda de si, tras este aparatoso contratiempo, se puede considerar que Japón es el quinto país que ha aterrizado con éxito en la Luna. Japón sostiene que sí.\nLa misión SLIM (’Smart Lander for Investigating Moon’) despegó el septiembre del año pasado desde el centro espacial japonés de Tanegashima. Durante varios meses, esta misión vagó por el espacio. El día de Navidad consiguió, por fin, insertarse correctamente en la órbita lunar. Y tras varias semanas sobrevolando su superficie, a mediados de enero los responsables de la misión afirmaron que, por fin, estaban en condiciones óptimas para intentar un aterrizaje un aterrizaje de precisión en un cráter situado en el sureste de la cara visible de la Luna. Todo apunta a que el recorrido de la misión transcurrió con éxito hasta que, al final, algo falló.\nTodavía no está claro si la avería en los paneles solares es un problema estructural que venía desde la Tierra. Tampoco se sabe si la maquinaria se pudo haber estropeado durante el proceso de alunizaje. Los responsables de la misión creen que podría tratarse de un problema en la orientación de los paneles. En ese caso, habría que esperar a que el sol cambiara su ángulo para ver si así se consigue generar energía. Ese proceso podría demorar más de 30 días terrestres. Y no está claro cómo estará entonces toda la maquinaria espacial. Por el momento, se han apagado varios sistemas a bordo para ahorrar cuanta más energía posible y alargar el rendimiento de las baterías a bordo.",

    "title": "He was taken from his home a healthy man. He came back on his deathbed. – Mondoweiss",
    "text": "On Wednesday, December 20, a photo began circulating on social media that sparked sadness, outrage, and fear among Palestinians.\nIt was a side-by-side comparison of 30-year-old Farouq Ahmad Issa, before and after a stint in Israeli prison. The “before” photo shows a smiling Farouq, and by all accounts, a healthy 30-year-old man. The “after” photo shows a pained, emaciated and gaunt man, reduced to skin and bones, lying on a hospital bed being caressed by his mother.\nThe photo of Farouq, his head shaved, hollowed eyes, emaciated body and sunken face, quickly went viral, with the initial post shared by Quds News Network reaching well over 8 million views on X . Many people on the platform compared the image of Farouq to those of Jewish prisoners who were starved and tortured in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.\nThe moment when Farouq Khateeb reunited with his family. pic.twitter.com/46noRMTJdO\n— Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 20, 2023 Many speculated as to what caused such a severe deterioration in Farouq’s condition. Was it torture? Starvation? Medical neglect? All tactics that have been widely reported by human rights groups and Palestinians recently released from Israeli custody.\nAccording to his family, Farouq was subjected to everything: beatings, the deprivation of food, and medical neglect. It was the medical neglect, however, that they say is what led Farouq to where he is now: receiving palliative care at a Ramallah hospital, waiting for death to knock on his door.\n“We still can’t really process or understand how we got here,” Husam Issa, 33, Farouq’s older brother, told Mondoweiss . “We are shocked and devastated. The doctors told us there is nothing we can do except pray for mercy from God.”\nThrown in administrative detention Farouq, a resident of the Ramallah-area village of Abu Skheidim in the occupied West Bank, was arrested in late August by the Israeli military. The arrest came as a shock to the family, who had only just gotten Farouq back home two months prior, after he completed a four year sentence in Israeli prison.\nFarouq was sentenced by an Israeli military court to six months in administrative detention, a policy that allows Israel to imprison Palestinians indefinitely without charge or trial. The policy is frequently weaponized against former prisoners like Farouq to allow Israel to throw them back in prison under closed files of “secret evidence.” In short, neither Farouq nor his family were told why he was arrested and put back in jail for another six months.\n“For the first month or so of his detention, as far as we knew, things were okay. His lawyer was in contact with him, and health-wise, everything was fine,” Husam told Mondoweiss .\nBut on October 7, everything changed.\nAfter Hamas’s attack on October 7, Israel began cracking down on Palestinians everywhere, including inside Israeli prisons. Israeli prison authorities conducted widespread raids, transferring prisoners, confiscating their personal belongings, limiting their food intake, and shutting them out from the outside world. That meant no televisions to watch the news, no lawyer visits, and no family visits.\n“All of a sudden, we stopped hearing any news from Farouq and his lawyer. No one could go visit him or even speak to him. But as far as we knew, everything was fine,” Husam said.\nIn late November, after not hearing from Farouq for more than a month, his family got a knock at their door. It was a young man from the area, recently released from prison, who had urgent news about Farouq.\n“Do you know what’s happening to your brother?” Husam recounted, repeating the first question asked by the young man, who said he was in the same prison as Farouq before he was released.\n“When we told him that we didn’t know what he was talking about, he told us that our brother was dying. And we needed to save him before it was too late,” Husam said.\nBeatings and medical neglect Through information gathered from the young man, as well as Farouq after he was released, the family was able to piece together what happened to him.\nAfter October 7, Israeli prison authorities began conducting frequent and arbitrary prison transfers — a common tactic of collective punishment used against Palestinian prisoners, meant to tire them mentally and physically by breaking apart any political groups organized in prison, splitting prisoners up from cellmates with whom they may have formed bonds after longer sentences, and by subjecting them to arduous journeys between prisons.\nDuring one such prisoner transfer from the Ofer prison in Ramallah to the Nafha prison, located in the Naqab desert, Farouq was badly beaten by Israeli prison guards along with several other Palestinian prisoners.\nAccording to Husam, an Israeli prison guard forcefully hit Farouq in the stomach with what he described as a large iron baton.\nIt wasn’t long after that Farouq began experiencing a number of symptoms, including severe abdominal pain and stomach swelling. When Farouq requested medical care, he was denied and thrown by Israeli guards into solitary confinement instead, where he was subjected to sleep and food deprivation.\nFarouq’s condition continued to deteriorate, with his stomach swelling to “the size of a watermelon.” He experienced weakness, vomiting, and dyschezia, and at one point, he was unable to pass a bowel movement for several weeks. Farouq began losing weight rapidly, with his family saying he lost more than 30 kilograms (66 pounds) in the span of a month.\nWith his health severely deteriorating, he was transferred to the Ramleh prison clinic, an Israeli prison clinic notorious for its medical neglect of sick Palestinian prisoners . There, he was treated with painkillers. With no real medical care to address his serious ailments, his health continued to deteriorate.\nEventually, Farouq’s condition became so serious that he was admitted to an Israeli hospital, the Soroka Medical Center, on November 29. For several days, he underwent a number of tests and procedures. A week later, he was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and began receiving a number of intravenous drugs to help with the pain. A week after he received his diagnosis, he was transferred back to the custody of Israeli Prison Service (IPS) doctors.\nDuring the entire ordeal, Farouq’s family was unaware of what was happening to him and that he was being diagnosed by Israeli doctors with terminal cancer.\n“We still had no information about him, but every day after the young man visited us to tell us about Farouq’s condition, we were doing everything we could to try and reach him or get any information about him,” Husam told Mondoweiss .\n“We contacted everybody. Human rights groups, prisoners’ groups, lawyers, PA officials — everybody. Just to try and get someone to be able to visit him and assess his condition.”\nAccording to Husam, every appeal from all the organizations, officials, and lawyers that contacted the IPS on behalf of the family was refused.\n‘He came back as skin and bones’ After nearly a month of trying to obtain any information about Farouq, the family got a call from their lawyer on December 20, saying he was informed by the IPS that he would be able to visit Farouq in prison.\n“We were relieved, but then just one hour later, we got another call saying that Farouq was going to be dropped off at the Nil’in checkpoint near Ramallah and that we should go pick him up,” Husam said.\n“We were shocked and confused because Farouq still had two months left on his administrative detention order. And they [Israel] don’t just release anyone like that,” Husam said, adding that the family rushed to the checkpoint, fearful of the state in which they would find their son.\nTheir worst fears were confirmed when they saw Farouq approaching them.\n“We didn’t recognize him. We were totally shocked. It was a horrifying sight. He looked like skin and bones,” Husam recounted.\nThe family rushed Farouq to a hospital in Ramallah, where doctors did a number of tests to confirm the diagnosis given by Israeli doctors: Farouq had terminal stomach cancer that was spreading to other parts of his body. He didn’t have much time left, and all the family could do was give him palliative care.\n“I can’t believe it. Now we are just waiting for him to die,” Husam said, expressing shock and disbelief held by his family. “When Farouq left us, he was perfectly healthy. When he returned, he came back a ghost.”\nThe family is unsure about what role the heavy beating that Farouq took in Israeli prison contributed to his health situation. They are sure, however, that the medical neglect faced by Farouq played a part in his deterioration.\n“For weeks, Farouq was complaining to them about his pain, but they did nothing. They waited until he got so bad that they had no choice but to take him to the hospital,” Husam said, adding that the family believes if he had been treated when he first began exhibiting symptoms, maybe things would have ended up differently.\n“The Israelis did not give him a chance for treatment. They also didn’t give him a chance to inform his family, nor did they inform us themselves,” Husam said. “This is a crime — what was done to him and to us, his family.”\n“If it weren’t for his cellmate who was released from prison, we wouldn’t know anything about Farouq. Maybe he would have died in prison, and we wouldn’t have known until it was too late.”\nThough it is too late for his brother, Husam hopes that the photos of Farouq will stir something in people and cause them to act.\n“I hope after people see these pictures of Farouq, that it will make the world move, make them take action for the Palestinian prisoners. Look at Farouq before and after. Look at this crime. I can’t comprehend it,” he said, comparing the treatment of Palestinian prisoners by Israel to the treatment of Jewish victims of the Nazis during the Holocaust.\n“The world must open their eyes. Look at what is happening to our prisoners. It cannot be ignored,” he said. “We don’t want our people to come back [from prison] in coffins. We want them to come back alive and healthy. That is our right, and that is their right, too.”",

    "text": "Immagine – Zoo di Houston.\nIl team veterinario dello Zoo di Houston ha improvvisato un collare cervicale minuscolo per salvare una cavalletta.\n+ Studentessa cieca combatte contro ogni probabilità ed è ammessa alla scuola di veterinaria del Texas.\nIl team veterinario dello Zoo di Houston, in Texas, USA, è stato semplicemente brillante nell’improvvisare un collare cervicale minuscolo per salvare una piccola cavalletta. L’insetto è stato soccorso dopo che uno dei custodi ha notato una sorta di ‘piega’ sul collo del piccolo animale.\nLa piccola ruga è apparsa dopo che la femmina della specie di cavalletta, originaria del Perù e dell’Ecuador, ha subito la muta, un processo durante il quale l’esoscheletro viene cambiato, permettendo all’insetto di continuare a crescere.\nDopo la muta, l’insetto ha presentato un’area indebolita intorno alla parte del corpo, simile a un “collo”. Secondo un recente post sul blog dello zoo, questo è stato causato da una piega nella regione toracica; l’area indebolita faceva sì che la testa dell’insetto cadesse completamente indietro ogni volta che cercava di arrampicarsi su qualcosa.\nLa piccola cavalletta è stata portata d’urgenza nella clinica veterinaria, dove Julie, l’entomologa dello zoo, ha avuto l’idea di proteggere la testa dell’insetto con un collare cervicale. Per costruire l’attrezzatura miniaturizzata, ha utilizzato un bastoncino di cotone sterilizzato e un po’ di cerotto. L’ingegnosità ha mantenuto la testa e il torace della cavalletta sostenuti e stabili, consentendo la guarigione della piega.\nImmagine – Zoo di Houston.\nPochi giorni dopo, quando il collare cervicale è stato rimosso, l’insetto è riuscito a mantenere la testa alta. Secondo lo zoo, una piccola cicatrice causata dalla lesione iniziale è ancora visibile, ma la femmina della cavalletta sta bene e è in grado di arrampicarsi e muoversi come prima.\n“Sia che si tratti di un mammifero, di un rettile, di un uccello o anche di un insetto, tutti i nostri animali ricevono cure straordinarie dal nostro team veterinario, indipendentemente da quanto siano grandi o piccoli”, ha detto lo Zoo di Houston, comprensibilmente molto orgoglioso del lavoro di Julie e di tutto il team di entomologia e custodia.\n“Insieme, con l’aiuto del nostro team di entomologia e veterinaria, una delle nostre creature più piccole ha ricevuto un trattamento eccezionale, grazie al design ingegnoso di un collare cervicale temporaneo.”",

    "title": "Here Are All the Pages of Sapporo-Stone’s Union-Busting Playbook (So Far)",
    "text": "Many companies would rather their workers didn’t form unions, because union workers tend to make more money and take less shit than non-union workers, and don’t have to pretend they think of their bosses like “family.”\nSo companies will often try to kibosh their workers’ organizing efforts. Owners and managers like to call this practice “union avoidance,” or simply “persuading,” which is somehow both less and more revealing. Workers, unions, and their allies have another term for it: “union-busting.”\nRegardless of what you call it, Sapporo-Stone Brewing is currently doing it.\nLate last month, I\nbroke the news that workers at Stone’s plant here in Richmond, Va., were organizing with Teamsters Local 322, a branch of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The drive began in 2023 shortly after Sapporo USA unceremoniously handed Anchor Brewing Company’s 150-plus-year legacy over to liquidators and pivoted its American ambitions to the East Coast outpost of the San Diego-based craft brewery it’d bought the year prior. Stone Richmond workers told VinePair they were organizing for all the standard stuff: better pay, conditions, and scheduling.\nIn early June, before the drive even went public, Sapporo-Stone Brewing (SSB) caught wind of it. There are few secrets in brewhouses, after all. The firm, which had just completed a\n$40 million renovation on the brewery to boost its capacity to pump out fresh Sapporo Premium for the U.S. market, did something pretty standard, too. It began trying to bust the union.\nIt’s important to be explicit that this doesn’t have to happen. Stone workers who want to be represented by Teamsters Local 322 signed union cards saying so; the union told me it went public with around 70 percent of cards signed from workers in the proposed bargaining unit (more on this in a moment). If Stone wanted to, it could run a\ncard check, see if the union did indeed have majority support among its workers, then voluntarily recognize the union.\nThis is the easy way. No workers get fired, no bosses get their feelings hurt, no journalists have to dedicate another f*cking column to corporate union-busting. For reasons noted above, companies don’t like this option. But it has merits!\nDare to dream. In Richmond, SSB has chosen the hard way forward for itself and its workers. The hard way is basically:\n- Convince your workers that unions are bad before they organize.\n- Convince them not to sign cards once they start to organize.\n- Convince them to vote against being represented by the union after they sign cards.\nOn paper, these steps seem absurdly straightforward, even impotent. But they’re remarkably effective, and have been for years, because bosses have two extremely formidable weapons at their disposal:\n- Time, because they can force a union election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which often takes months. Stone’s is currently scheduled for Oct. 3 of this year. “Time is huge, and employers know that, especially in a place like a brewery,” one labor scholar who has studied the craft brewing industry\ntoldHop Take for a column about the acrimonious anti-union campaign Creature Comforts Brewing Co. waged against its workers for much of last year. That drive eventually went to an NLRB election nine months after going public; the union lost.\n- “Persuaders,” which is the NLRB’s jargon for the consultants, some of them former union members themselves, who fly in to help bosses flip union elections in their favor. These hired guns “play a crucial role in keeping U.S. union membership near a historic low — and they are well rewarded for their efforts,”\nwrotelabor journalist Dave Jamieson in an excellent package for HuffPost last year shining light on the murky, lucrative industry. “Many now earn more than $2,000 per day.”\nOn July 19, a full month and a half before workers at its brewhouse had even gone public with their drive, SSB struck a deal with Government Resources Consultants of America, Inc., (GRCA) according to a\nmandatory filing by the latter firm with the Office of Labor Management Standards at the U.S. Bureau of Labor. An analysis by the independent pro-labor watchdog Labor Lab found that the firm took in over $3 million in fees in 2022 for its work “persuad[ing] employees to exercise or not to exercise, or persuad[ing] employees as to the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.” Only one “persuader” firm took in more cash than GRCA from companies trying to bust their unions that year. It is notoriously aggressive, even among its bare-knuckled peers.\nGRCA did not respond to a request for comment. SSB’s spokesperson declined multiple requests to comment on hiring the infamous firm, or any of my other questions about the drive.\nPro-union workers inside Stone Richmond have told Hop Take what GRCA’s sub-contracted operatives are up to at the plant since arriving two months ago. Combined with Stone’s in-house bosses’ own tactics, it amounts to color-by-numbers union-busting.\nAs is often the case, SSB went with the carrot first. The company sent workers “a big letter telling us they love us and know they f*cked up and hope we can forgive them,” a pro-union worker told me via text. Richmond supervisors began scheduling round-tables with workers “who have had experiences with unions in the past” to share their experiences with coworkers, and sent out messages to an internal communication board soliciting stories from workers who “experienced, accomplished, or valued something during” their time working at the company, “and how Sapporo-Stone enabled it.” In late July, it issued a round of purportedly pre-planned raises.\nThe company also formed a Richmond-specific “Cultural Action Team” with local bosses and employees, which eventually produced an ice-cream social in mid-August that would allow managers to rub elbows with workers on a visit to Virginia. Workers tie-dyed shirts and ate frozen desserts alongside members of SSB’s executive team, including chief executive Zach Keeling, who is not based in the River City.\n“It felt like a combination of the classic ‘pizza party’ move, plus [Richmond managers] trying to show off to the executives that we sometimes have fun,” another current worker told me, referring to a\npopular pro-labor meme.\nAs it became clear these tactics hadn’t stalled the drive, SSB switched to the stick. All workers within Stone’s Richmond plant who spoke to Hop Take did so on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation during the drive. This is not an idle concern: A week before the drive went public, SSB fired a vocally pro-union worker in Richmond. The union has since\nfiled an unfair labor practice (ULP) against the firm alleging the termination violated federal labor law.\nThe initial filing with the NLRB specified the proposed bargaining unit would only include workers at the Richmond warehouse, not SSB’s separate warehouse east of the city; Teamsters Local 322 has since agreed to loop in workers at that warehouse at the company’s request. “They’re trying to dilute the [pro-union] vote, and they know it’s creating more work for me,” Local 322’s Dwayne Johnson told Hop Take by phone Wednesday. This seemingly innocuous gambit puts organizers in a bind. Either agree to the expansion and dilute the vote, or fight the company before the labor board and give the impression it doesn’t want the workers covered by the proposed expansion in the union, sapping time and momentum in the process. “It’s a little bit of an uphill battle now that they added” around 10 warehouse workers to the proposed unit, conceded Johnson, but he said the union eventually planned to organize the warehouse anyway. “Why make ‘em wait?” The total unit, including shift leads (which the company is also fighting to exclude from the election, apparently because it considers them as likely pro-union voters), now stands at around 100 workers.\nThe company also began handing out a series of anti-union flyers to workers, each titled “Just the Facts.” (I’ve obtained all of them so far, and uploaded them to\nGoogle Drive so you can check them out in full.) It may not shock you to learn that they are not, in fact, just the facts. The unsigned flyers, each of which features the logos of Sapporo and Stone up top and a checkbox graphic at the bottom that says “UNION NO,” are riddled with common near-falsehoods and alarming half-truths about organized labor that bosses have used to bust drives for literal decades. They’re so common there’s a whole book about them (“ Confessions of a Union-Buster,” a mea culpa from a 20th-century practitioner of GRCA’s trade) and a whole website, too ( UnionBustingPlaybook.com, a resource maintained by the Communications Workers of America). Because they’ve been so well-covered, I’m not going to bother addressing each point here. Here’s a taste, though. The flyers ominously cast the Teamsters Local 322 as an “outside third-party,” even though they were almost certainly written by GRCA or its agents — outside third-parties themselves. Hmm!\nWill this union-busting playbook work in Richmond? Who knows. But it will certainly cost SSB a lot of money either way — money it could use to, y’know, simply pay its employees.\n“Where a company has invested to support their success as a business, they should be supporting the success of their employees,” says Andreas Addison, a Richmond city councilmember who is\ncurrently running for mayor. He tells me he supports Stone workers’ drive with an unequivocal “yes.” He’s not a neophyte on union negotiations, either — in 2023, when the city’s transit board negotiated with its union to increase bus drivers’ starting pay 40 percent to address labor shortages, Addison was serving as its vice chair, a position he still holds. “We’re in a housing crisis in the city of Richmond right now, and a lot of that comes down to what our workforce is compensated,” he tells me. Imagine that.\nObviously, this is a smart stance for a politician to take when running for office in a relatively blue city like Richmond. Then again, with pro-labor sentiment at historic highs nationally,\nit could be a smart stance for SSB, too. If only the firm would take a page out of that playbook.\n🤯 Hop-ocalypse Now\nNobody outside the One Percent has accused the modern National Football League of being affordable family fun, and nobody should. But even fans who that think they know what they’re signing up for may want to check the price of beer at their team’s stadium before laying out for tickets. The Washington Commanders led the league this year,\ncharging a staggering $16.49 per 16-ounce beer, more than double the price of the same liquid at a Cincinnati Bengals game ($6.80 apiece). Sure, the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association were https://vinepair.com/booze-news/beer-price-every-nba-stadium-2023/ an absolutely obscene $19.87 for 16 ounces of beer during the 2023 season, so it’s not like football teams are alone in gouging John and Jane Q. Guzzler, but still, who’s paying these prices?! Anyway, I’m sure private equity’s looming incursion into the NFL will work wonders on this front.

    "text": "Assassin's Creed Shadows é adiado novamente: Nova data de lançamento é em março de 2025\nUbisoft explica o atraso como parte de sua estratégia para garantir qualidade e imersão aos jogadores\nhá 4 horas\nA Ubisoft anunciou mais um adiamento de Assassin's Creed Shadows, com a nova data de lançamento agora marcada para 20 de março de 2025. Originalmente planejado para fevereiro, o jogo teve sua estreia postergada em nome de melhorias na qualidade e na experiência dos jogadores.\nMotivo do adiamento\nEm comunicado oficial nas redes sociais, a Ubisoft justificou o adiamento como parte de uma estratégia renovada após lançamentos recentes não atingirem as expectativas de qualidade.

Por outro lado, muitos elogiaram a decisão da Ubisoft de priorizar a qualidade, considerando a importância de Assassin's Creed Shadows como um dos lançamentos mais aguardados da série.\nA franquia Assassin's Creed tem sido uma referência no gênero de ação e aventura, e as expectativas para Shadows são altas. O jogo promete trazer um enredo mais sombrio e mecânicas renovadas, o que reforça a importância de um lançamento impecável.",
