    "title": "145 child welfare workers pen letter of no confidence in agency leadership",
    "text": "By AnnMarie Hilton ,\n11 days ago Addressing the oversight committee Wednesday, DHHS Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said Jaden and every other child who died under the care of the state lost their chance at a future. “We mourn their loss,” she said. “I mourn their loss. And I ask myself and lose sleep over the question, ‘Could each child have survived if something different had been done in the child welfare system?’” (Getty Images)\nFrontline workers for Maine’s child welfare system are again expressing concerns over agency leadership and its ability to listen to employees and keep children safe.\nOne hundred and forty five caseworkers, community care workers and case aides in the Office of Child and Family Services signed a letter of no confidence in the agency’s director, Bobbi Johnson, who has served in the role since January. The letter outlines safety concerns for children in state custody and a pattern of management ignoring staff concerns, according to a news release from the Maine Service Employees Association, SEIU Local 1989, which represents the workers.\nThe letter asks Gov. Janet Mills and Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes to replace Johnson immediately. The Office of Child and Family Services is housed within DHHS.\nMore than 2,500 children were in state custody as of September, according to the most recent data on the state’s Child Welfare Data Dashboard . That is slightly lower but similar to when Johnson took over as director. However, the number of children in state custody has grown over the past few years from about 1,700 in July 2018.\nIn a statement responding to the letter, Gagné-Holmes said Johnson has her full support as she remains “confident in her compassionate, responsive and effective leadership.” As an example, Gagné-Holmes said Johnson has visited every OCFS district office three times since she assumed her role to listen to frontline staff.\n“We recognize no single measure can solve every challenge in a system this complex, but the director’s commitment to listening, adapting, and supporting staff is unwavering,” she said.\nA key issue raised in the letter is the agency’s practice of having children stay in hotels or emergency rooms while they are in state custody. The workers said that continued use of this practice — which has become more of a problem as the number of children in state custody has increased — means Johnson is “unable to ensure the well-being and safety of children and OCFS staff.”\n“The Director’s inaction in finding an alternate to the warehousing of children in hotels or emergency rooms lends to the perception by many frontline workers that those in Central Office are reinforcing the misconception that hotels and emergency rooms are the only options for housing children,” the letter reads. “The focus on scheduling and costs associated with warehousing children in hotel and emergency rooms belies the actual needs of the children.”\nThe letter asks Mills and Gagné-Holmes to work with the Legislature to develop alternatives to having children stay in hotels and emergency rooms.\nMills’ office said her administration has been focused on trying to effectively curb the use of hotels because it believes children in state custody deserve a safe, loving and permanent home.\nBut it added that “the allegations and personal attacks against Director Johnson are meritless and this extreme approach by the union is not productive, nor does it serve the long-term shared goal of trying to reduce the use of hotels.”\nFoster care is not an option for many of these children due to their mental health or behavior histories, the release said. In addition to their regularly assigned job duties, caseworkers and other frontline staff serve as caregivers for these children by making sure their needs are met as far as meals, medication, clothing, hygiene, transportation to and from school and recreational opportunities.\nThe union also filed a complaint with the Maine Department of Labor Thursday morning about OCFS workers being required to stay overnight in hotels with children in state custody. The release said this has resulted in multiple employees being assaulted by minors over the past several years.\nWorkers listed out seven specific safety issues in the letter, saying they have raised each of them repeatedly in meetings with Johnson without resolution. They include staff having to restrain children and not being certified to administer medication. Workers are also concerned that working multiple shifts in a 24-36 hour window can result in them failing to document vital case information, miss deadlines and even drive under unsafe conditions.\nThis isn’t the first time child protective workers are coming forward with concerns. Earlier this year, they testified before legislative committees about understaffing and high caseloads throughout the agency. In July, workers also wrote to Johnson and Gagné-Holmes with concerns over scheduling changes OCFS leadership wanted to implement.\n“The (unilateral) changes will further exhaust an already exhausted state workforce,” the workers wrote in the July letter. “The results are obvious: a rippling effect throughout our entire system, decreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our child protective system statewide.”\nDuring the last legislative session, there were multiple attempts to improve the state’s embattled child welfare system. However, lawmakers’ work came to a close with little to show as far as concrete action. The Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee did put forth a list of more than two dozen suggested reforms , which were informed by the months they spent learning about the system’s failures from caseworkers and others involved with the agency.\nOn Friday, legislative Republicans responded to the letter, calling for major reforms of the child welfare system. Specifically, they want to see the Office of Child and Family Services prioritized in the upcoming state biennial budget.\n“The future of our communities depends on making kids a priority,” said Sen. Jeff Timberlake, of Androscoggin County, who is the Senate Republican lead on the Government Oversight Committee. “We will continue our efforts to hold the Mills administration accountable for its failure to do so.”\nAdditionally, a recently released federal audit showed that a vast majority of child abuse cases in the state failed to comply with best practices. After those results came out Johnson said the agency policy and technology updates that have been implemented under her leadership would produce better results if a similar audit was completed again.\nNote: This story has been updated to include a response from legislative Republicans.\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n2",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content\nThe 20-year-old man, who can’t be named because he was 17 on April 25, 2022, when Leger was shot and killed in his Moncton home, returned to the witness stand in the second-degree murder trial of 20-year-old Riley Phillips after a week’s break to allow the judge and lawyers to work out a legal issue. The witness testified last week and his cross-examination began but was put on hold until his return to the stand on Thursday.\nThe witness previously said he and five others went to Logan Lane to rob Leger and his girlfriend, Chantal Boudreau. He told the jury Thursday they had heard there might be more than $30,000 in the home.\nThe witness said last week that Phillips was the only one to enter the house and he heard several gunshots before seeing Phillips jump down the stairs and run out of the house.\nThe young offender told the court he heard a .22-calibre gun fire, then the sound of louder gunshots. He had testified Phillips was carrying a .38-calibre revolver and told the group after the shooting that he was shot in the hand but put four shots in Leger. Police seized a .22-calibre homemade gun from Leger’s home and the jury has watched videos of him firing it and playing with it on different occasions.\nDefence lawyer Brian Munro asked the witness if shooting Leger was part of the plan.\n“You didn’t intend to shoot anybody that night?” he asked, to which the witness said no.\nThe witness told the jury he didn’t even know Leger, that he had just heard his name in the days before the shooting. During cross-examination he said he had heard Leger was “going around robbing people” that “I was told he put a gun to somebody’s head.”\nMorning Email Times & Transcript A clear and concise roundup to start your weekday morning.\nThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Article content\nThese answers prompted a caution by the judge that the information is hearsay and the witness only heard those things.\nMunro asked the witness about several statements he gave to police and the fact his story evolved over time, with more detail provided. He asked the witness if he was lying but the young offender answered that he was holding back information at first.\n“I was still on the fence about being a snitch,” the witness said.\nWhen prosecutor Stephen Holt later asked him to elaborate on that comment, the witness said he was on the fence about providing information and helping police. He said he grew up being told you don’t “rat.”\n“I know what you mean, but what is a ‘rat,'” asked Holt.\n“Exactly what I’m doing right now,” said the young offender.\nHe said he only decided to tell police the full story after talking to his family.\n“I wanted to do the right thing,” he said. “I felt guilty that I was involved in a very serious offence. We took the life of someone who had a future.”\nHe said it was the right thing to do for Leger’s family, who attend the trial most days.\n“They need justice,” the witness said.\nMunro asked the witness if his goal was to make a deal with the Crown to testify in this trial, but the young offender denied that. Munro suggested he was originally charged with first-degree murder and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n“So was everybody else,” the youth responded.\nWhile all accused in the case were initially charged with first-degree murder, Nicholas McAvoy and Hayden LeBlanc pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced in August, Hunter England pleaded guilty to manslaughter but a publication ban prevents any further reporting on his case at this time and Jerek England will stand trial in the future on charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content\nThe youth denied he got any deal for his co-operation and while the defence lawyer agreed there was no deal on paper, he kept prodding the witness by suggesting he got a deal because he was charged as a youth when he could have been charged as an adult. The witness maintained he got no deal and was given the maximum sentence a youth can get for manslaughter: Three years, including two years in jail and one year on conditions. He said he got out of jail last November and is currently on conditions.\nMunro said the youth would have done anything not to be charged as an adult and got the witness to read a line from a transcript of a conversation he had with an undercover police officer in a cell after his arrest.\n“A judge would have to be the biggest bitch ever if I got charged as an adult,” the young offender said, reading the transcript.\nMunro also asked if he told police he planned to forge his passport and flee to Peru while he was on the run between the shooting and his arrest in June and the witness agreed he told police that.\nThe defence lawyer also asked Phillips if the shooting was not so much a robbery but something that stemmed from ill will between Leger and England, whom the jury has head was the getaway driver.\n“This night was about that fight between Hunter England and Joedin Leger?” the lawyer asked.\nThe witness said he didn’t know anything about that at the time of the robbery but heard something about it after the shooting.\nCourt of King’s Bench Justice Robert Dysart cautioned the jury after the witness was finished, that while they have now heard evidence that the young offender and others may have pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Leger’s death, that has no bearing on whether or not the jury finds Phillips guilty.\nThe trial continues with more witnesses Friday.\nArticle content Share this article in your social network",

    "text": "— News — MSNBC Anchor Shocked By Brutal Responses From Black Voters In Philadelphia About Kamala \"I don't want to be scared because my president's scared, I want my president to feel secure, and manly, and about it,\" a voter said. [MSNBC](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/msnbc) anchor Alex Wagner was clearly shocked by the brutal responses from black voters in Philadelphia when it came to why they were supporting former President [Donald Trump](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/donald-trump) instead of Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/kamala-harris). In the [clip](https://x.com/Kelly4Humanity/status/1848945993263501593) that aired on the network, Wagner sat down and talked to the voters in a blue county of the swing state of Pennsylvania who explained why they couldn’t support the Democratic candidate, with answers ranging from her not having enough experience to not being the right personality to be the leader of the free world. “She’s a woman of color. I’m not putting her down because of that,” one woman said. “I’m not putting her down because she’s a woman … but at the end of the day, I don’t think that [Kamala] has the personality.” “We all know she’s not black” – Surprised MSNBC aired this one. [pic.twitter.com/U7mK7lofUO]— Christy Kelly (@Kelly4Humanity) [October 23, 2024] “I don’t think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this,” she added. “I don’t want to be scared because my president’s scared, I want my president to feel secure, and manly, and about it.” When asked if it was because Harris is a woman that she wasn’t supporting her, another woman said no — she just doesn’t “have the qualification or the education to really run America. Because she don’t have the experience. She don’t understand our struggles. And for me to believe you for another four years, you’re crazy. Like, you’re crazy. You’re saying the same thing that you said four years ago.” A third woman said, “The first time I heard the name Kamala Harris, it was in association to locking up parents for truancy … I really didn’t understand how this person claims to be a black woman, but yet she’s locking up black women and black men and separating families.” [MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28](https://www.amiracist.com/) Another voter was asked about Trump’s comments earlier in the campaign about how Harris previously embraced her Indian heritage before she embraced being black. “Absolutely! She’s sworn into the Senate, it was the first Indian American … and that’s fine, we don’t care,” one woman said. Another woman interjected, “We all know that she’s not black, let’s understand that. … But my point of view is, she’s already been there. She’s in office right now.” Later, a group voters explained why they were definitely pulling the lever for Trump. “For me, it’s immigration. I myself come from an immigrant family. I’m Guatemalan,” one [person](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/10/23/black_republican_women_to_msnbc_i_dont_think_harris_has_what_it_takes_to_go_up_against_putin.html) said. “And for us, seeing the new immigrants come in, they’re more violent, it’s more chaos.” “And we’ve been here for longer than them, and it’s starting to affect us more because stuff is getting stolen,” he added. “They’re making us look bad as immigrants and we’ve been here longer than them. And we’re getting more misrepresentation because of them.” Another person said they were voting for Trump “unequivocally, period. No one else is going to persuade us. We’re two weeks out, and we won’t sleep until November 6,” [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/black-voters-swing-state-pennsylvania-harris-trump-rcna176872) reported.
