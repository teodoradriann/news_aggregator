    "text": "Power Companies are seeing improvements in power outages after the ice storm\nAYR, N.D., (KVRR)- A storm hit the region over Christmas, causing up to an inch of ice to accumulate in some areas. The ice downed miles of power lines and snapped countless utility poles. Power Crews have been working around the clock since Christmas to help bring back power back to the citizens impacted by the ice storm.\nAround 480 Cass County Electric customers were still without power Wednesday morning. At one time, more than 4,600 members were affected.\nDakota Valley crews are also doing their best to return things to normal. Brandon Giesler, Manager of Engineering at Dakota Valley Electric Cooperative, said, “Everybody has been coming in at 7 in the morning and typically working until, you know, the start, it was prolly around 9 or 10 at night. And as its been going along, they’ve been shutting down a little sooner.”\nGiesler also said, “But right now I believe we are down to one hundred and thirty some, i haven’t looked in the past hour or so but i believe that is where we are sitting right now.”\nDakota Valley initially had 3200 people without power. In just a week, Dakota Valley was impressed with the teamwork done to pull this off.\nGiesler said, “But the amount of progress these guys have been making is crazy. I thought it was going to take a little longer to get it to come to this point. But when you get that many people on the ground, it’s been coming together well.”\nDakota Valley Electric has had at least 100 people on the ground throughout the past week and expects the job to be finished soon.\nCass County Electric updated its power outage numbers tonight: they stand at 209 members.\nThe majority should be restored by the weekend.",

    "title": "What to know about the Supreme Court’s ruling allowing mifepristone to stay on the market",
    "text": "By CNN staff (CNN) — The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit on Thursday challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone, allowing the drug to stay on the market.The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court’s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future.Medication abortion accounts for nearly two-thirds of all US abortions , according to some estimates. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy, and it has been shown to be safe and effective. The pill is also often prescribed for miscarriage treatment.Here’s what to know about the ruling: Plaintiffs had no standing The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue .Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the opinion, said the parties do not have standing “simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities — at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government’s alleged under-regulation of others.”Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone — the first drug in the medication abortion process — is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. Biden blames GOP for allowing challenge to abortion access President Joe Biden cast blame on Republicans for the very existence of the case, taking aim at GOP elected officials’ “extreme and dangerous agenda” on reproductive rights. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid.Meantime, former President Donald Trump cautioned Republicans not to go too far on abortion in a meeting with the House GOP conference. The big picture Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement.But the court’s technical reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Much of the opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute.In addition, the Supreme Court is yet to release a decision on a case related to abortions in health emergencies. The justices will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion .

Ahora, la firma de seguridad McAfee ha descubierto 14 aplicaciones infectadas en Google Play Store, y lo más preocupante, es que tres de las cuales tenían más de 100.000 instalaciones cada una . Lo identifican como una puerta trasera de Android llamada Xamalicious y que ya habría infectado a 338.300 dispositivos a través de estas aplicaciones maliciosas. Aunque estas aplicaciones maliciosas ya se han eliminado de Google Play, llegaron a estar disponibles en algún momento, y es probable que te las instalaras. De esta forma, echa un vistazo a alguna de estas aplicaciones fraudulentas por si las tienes instaladas en tu dispositivo Android : Por otra parte, un conjunto separado de 12 aplicaciones maliciosas que llevan esta amenaza, se llegaron a distribuir en tiendas de aplicaciones de terceros a través de Archivos APK. La mayoría de los dispositivos infectados se encuentran en Estados Unidos, Alemania, España, Reino Unido, Australia, Brasil, México y Argentina. El malware después de su instalación, se comunica con un servidor C2 y se activa si se cumplen ciertos requisitos previos específicos como lo geográficos. De esta forma, este malware puede recopilar información del dispositivo y del hardware, puede determinar la ubicación geográfica del dispositivo, puede enumerar todas las aplicaciones del sistema instaladas en el dispositivo e incluso puede informar del estado de los permisos de los servicios de accesibilidad. Por otra parte, también han descubierto, que Xamalicious también es capaz de realizar fraude publicitario en los dispositivos infectados, provocando que el rendimiento de tu móvil sea inferior al estar ocupándose de realizar clics fraudulentos en segundo plano.",

From November there​ is very little sunshine in the northern half. HA⁤ #Paris there⁣ have been less than 12 hours of sunshine as the beginning of December.

In a general flow oriented towards the ‌north-west, humid‍ and‌ very ⁣cool air circulates over France”,⁤ explains the site.\nAnd the same goes for​ the following days,until next Thursday when some rays are expected.“As ofen ⁣happens ⁣at this ⁣time of ⁣year, humidity will be high ⁤in the lower layers⁢ of the atmosphere,‍ which will result in numerous fogs and low⁣ clouds,” ⁤predicts La Chaîne Météo.You will have to​ go to the‌ mountains or towards⁢ the South-East to find the sun. »\nHow⁢ can residents of Paris cope with extended periods ⁣of gray skies? Interview: Exploring the Sunless Skies of Paris\nInterviewer : Welcome to ​Time.news! today, we’re joined ⁢by Dr. Elena Marceau, a climatologist and solar energy expert, to discuss a rather unusual phenomenon that has ‌left many Parisians wondering‍ if the sun has truly gone into hiding. Dr. Marceau, thank you for being hear.\nDr. marceau : Thank ​you for having me! It’s ⁤great to be here, especially to discuss such an intriguing topic.\nInterviewer : Indeed! so, let’s dive right in. Recently, Paris experienced five consecutive days ​without any sunlight. What caused this unusual weather pattern?\nDr.Marceau : This event was primarily due to a combination of seasonal weather factors, including persistent cloud cover and perhaps some atmospheric conditions ‍that trapped moisture in ⁢the air. During⁣ December, especially in northern Europe, it’s not uncommon to see prolonged periods of gray skies.\nInterviewer : It’s⁢ fascinating to think⁤ about how weather can influence the daily lives of people in cities like Paris. How do⁤ you think this lack of sunlight affects the residents?\nDr.⁣ Marceau : the ⁤impact can be quite significant! Prolonged lack of sunlight‌ can lead to⁢ mood changes and even Seasonal Affective Disorder ​(SAD) in some individuals. It’s not ‍just about feeling gloomy; the absence of sunlight can influence energy levels and ‌overall well-being. Some people may indeed be tempted to look into vitamin D supplements, as you mentioned earlier.\nInterviewer : Speaking of​ vitamin D, ⁢how vital is sunlight for our health, especially during the ​winter months?\ndr. Marceau : Sunlight is ‌crucial for our bodies as it⁤ helps produce vitamin D, which is essential for bone health, immune function, and overall mood regulation. In winter months, especially in places with limited sunlight, ‌dietary sources or supplements become vital. It’s always good for people to be aware of their vitamin D levels, especially after ⁢such long stretches of gloom.\nInterviewer : That makes sense. Now, for those who turned to this unusual situation as a warning sign of climate change, what would you say? Is this event indicative⁤ of larger trends ​we should​ be concerned about?\nDr. Marceau : While isolated weather events can feel alarming,it’s important to differentiate between short-term weather patterns and long-term climate trends. This gray spell doesn’t directly indicate climate change on it’s⁢ own. Though, it does highlight the urgency and importance of understanding how our climate is changing⁤ and how it might effect weather patterns in the future.\nInterviewer : So, a single event shouldn’t lead to panic, but ​it’s still ⁢a call⁢ for awareness about our climate. As we wrap up, what can Parisians do to cope with these sunless days?\nDr.Marceau : Great question! People in Paris can embrace indoor activities that promote ⁢well-being,such as yoga,reading,or cooking with friends. Light therapy lamps can also be helpful​ for⁢ those feeling a bit down. And, of course, getting any available sunlight whenever ​possible is beneficial, whether through ⁤a walk or sitting by a window.\nInterviewer : Thank you⁤ so much, Dr. Marceau! Today’s discussion sheds light on an frequently enough-overlooked aspect‌ of winter ⁢living in urban areas. Here’s hoping for some sunny days ahead—or⁢ at least a little vitamin D!\nDr. ​Marceau : Thank you for having me! Let’s stay informed and keep looking up.",
