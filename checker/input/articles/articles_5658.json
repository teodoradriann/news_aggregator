    "title": "Celebratory vibe at Cleveland Clinic’s ‘Get Your Pink On’ event",
    "text": "A fluffy pink cloud of hope hovered over the Scully-Welsh Cancer Center at Cleveland Clinic as breast cancer patients, survivors and their caregivers gathered for the annual Get Your Pink On event, which promotes wellness, education and support.\nAttendees had refreshments, including feathery pink cotton candy, as they chatted with representatives from a variety of vendors offering products and services tailored to cancer care, and learned of resources available to them.\nLater, the Cancer Dancers – a troupe of cancer survivors who celebrate life through music and dance – performed a routine to ABBA’s “Dancing Queen,” a song that embodies the positive attitude these women emanate. Their inspiring performance was a powerful reminder of the resilience of survivors.\nColleen Brennan, a founding member of the troupe, introduced each of the dancers and shared a bit of their cancer journeys.\nNext up were several four-footed, furry friends who frequent the cancer center, spreading joy and comfort to patients during treatments. This evening, however, the dogged therapists strutted their stuff in a Therapy Pet fashion show.\nThis year’s event focused on holistic health approaches, innovative technologies and the importance of community engagement. A panel of professionals provided insights into the fields of integrative medicine, including fitness, music therapy and acupuncture, as well as the latest advancements in cancer care technology.\nSeveral of the programs have been made possible through the generosity of Answer to Cancer, a charity group founded by residents of Grand Harbor. The fundraising efforts of the group have provided financial assistance to various initiatives and have enabled some patients to receive services at no cost.\nThe speakers emphasized the benefits of combining traditional cancer treatments with complementary therapies to manage symptoms and improve patients’ overall well-being during and after treatment.\n“Every year we have this celebration in honor of our breast cancer patients who have either completed treatment in the past or are currently undergoing treatment and really celebrate their journey. And not only celebrate the patients but also their family members and friends who helped them through this tough time,” said Dr. Eleni Tousimis, Scully-Welsh Cancer Center director.\nCommenting on the importance of celebrating caregivers and the Cancer Center’s staff members, Tousimis said there are approximately 100 employees working in the building and that the resolve of everyone “is patients first.”\nReferencing the recent tornadoes that swept through our area along with Hurricane Milton, Tousimis noted that the team worked through the weekend to ensure patients received radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\n“It was really touching to see them here on a Saturday and Sunday like it was a regular day.\nComing in on their free time to help our patients so nobody had a delay in treatment. Even during a very unusual situation with very unexpected weather,” she continued.\nAs the evening drew to a close, everyone left with a little more pep in their step, armed with renewed hope.\nPhotos by Joshua Kodis\nCancer Dancers Maureen Leu and Lori McCormick Justin Barenborg and Michele Tal Jeanine Nestor and Dr. Eleni Tousimis Dr. Adesola Awomolo and Sheronda Drisdom Judi Lampert and Boots Lillie Holt, Patty Poysell and Peggy Poysell Betty Ward, Mary Alexander and Elizabeth April Barbara Sloan and Carol VanCleve Alexis Candido, Jalicia Gachelin and Ellie Candido Matt and Joanne Wind.
