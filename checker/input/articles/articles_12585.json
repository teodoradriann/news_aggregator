    "title": "Winter Preparation for 5-Frame Nucs: Ensuring Colony Survival and Health",
    "text": "Introduction Aspiring beekeepers often turn to 5-frame nucleus colonies, or nucs, as a starting point for their apiary adventures\n1. Preparing Your Apiary for Nuc Arrival Before acquiring 5-frame nucs, it's crucial to prepare your apiary to welcome these new additions. Ensure that hive equipment, including additional hive bodies and frames, is ready for installation. Evaluate the placement of hives to maximize forage availability and minimize potential stressors, such as direct sunlight or strong winds.\n2. Establishing a Supportive Environment Creating a supportive environment is paramount to the success of 5-frame nucs. Provide ample forage sources in close proximity to the hives to facilitate colony growth and honey production. Consider planting bee-friendly flowers and herbs and avoiding the use of pesticides that may harm bees.\n3. Monitoring Nuc Health and Development Regular monitoring of nuc health and development is essential for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention. Conduct frequent hive inspections to assess brood patterns, population growth, and pest and disease levels. Keep meticulous records to track the progress of each colony and identify any trends or abnormalities.\n4. Implementing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices play a vital role in maintaining the health and resilience of 5-frame nucs. Employ preventative measures such as screened bottom boards and entrance reducers to deter pests such as Varroa mites and small hive beetles. Utilize non-chemical interventions such as drone brood trapping and powdered sugar dusting to manage pest populations effectively.\n5. Providing Nutritional Support Ensuring adequate nutrition is critical for the growth and vitality of 5-frame nucs, particularly during periods of nectar dearth or inclement weather. Supplemental feeding with sugar syrup or pollen patties can help sustain colonies during lean times and stimulate brood production. Monitor hive weight and consumption rates to gauge the effectiveness of feeding efforts.\n6. Managing Colony Expansion As 5-frame nucs outgrow their initial confines, proactive management is necessary to prevent overcrowding and swarming. Add additional hive bodies and frames as needed to accommodate population growth and provide ample space for brood rearing and honey storage. Conduct swarm prevention measures such as splitting colonies or requeening as appropriate.\n7. Educating Yourself and Seeking Support Continuous learning and seeking support from experienced beekeepers are invaluable resources for success with 5-frame nucs. Attend beekeeping workshops, seminars, and conferences to expand your knowledge and stay abreast of industry best practices. Establish connections with local beekeeping associations and mentorship programs to access guidance and support from seasoned beekeepers.\nConclusion Working with 5-frame nucleus colonies offers a rewarding and fulfilling beekeeping experience, but success requires diligence, patience, and a commitment to ongoing learning. By preparing your apiary, monitoring nuc health, implementing IPM practices, providing nutritional support, managing colony expansion, and seeking support from the beekeeping community, you can set the stage for a thriving and sustainable apiary teeming with healthy and productive bees.\nhoney bees for sale.

    "text": "An analyst's bullish new note on Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and the wider U.S. defense sector provided lift to the company's stock on an otherwise bearish Wednesday trading session. Lockheed Martin's shares closed the day almost 2% higher in price, providing quite the contrast to the tumbling S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 2.2% decline.\nThe analyst in question was Kristine Liwag of veteran white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley. Well before market open that day, Liwag changed her Lockheed Martin recommendation to overweight (i.e., buy) from equal weight (hold). In doing so, she added $50 per share to his price target on the storied defense stock, to $575 per share.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nThe pundit's new take on the company was part of a broader Morgan Stanley update on defense industry stocks. According to reports, the investment bank rates the entire sector as \"attractive,\" as opposed to its formerly cautious view that it'll be an in-line performer. The company sees the U.S. defense budget being set at $1 trillion this year, amid growing international exports of combat goods, as a positive for these stocks.\nWhile Morgan Stanley's top pick in the sector wasn't Lockheed Martin -- that honor went to longtime rival Northrop Grumman, due to better alignment with current U.S. defense priorities -- Liwag still felt Lockheed Martin was worthy of an upgrade. She particularly highlighted its robust and active foreign sales activities as potential motors of future growth.\nThis is indeed a fertile time for the global defense industry, with the grinding war in Ukraine, intense clashes in the Middle East, and rising geopolitical tensions elsewhere. Liwag is spot-on with her view that major defense exporters are in an excellent position just now, and Lockheed Martin is a primary example of such a company.\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $526,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $687,684!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.

    "title": "Justice Clarence Thomas took more trips on GOP megadonor’s private plane than previously known",
    "text": "(CNN) — [Justice Clarence Thomas](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/clarence-thomas-pushes-back-critics/index.html) took several more trips on the private plane of GOP megadonor Harlan Crow than were previously known, a top Senate Democrat revealed Thursday. According to information obtained by Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow’s private jet during trips in 2017, 2019 and 2021 between various US states, as well as on a previously known 2019 trip to Indonesia, during which Thomas also stayed on Crow’s mega-yacht. The newly revealed private plane trips [add to the picture of luxury travel](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/10/politics/clarence-thomas-gifts-hospitality-propublica-report/index.html) enjoyed by Thomas and bankrolled by friends of the justice who have ties to conservative politics. Thomas has come under fire for his failure to include such trips on financial disclosure forms the justices release each year, though he and his defenders argue that he followed the court’s disclosure rules as they were understood at the time. The revelation was likely to add to the tension between the high court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have been pushing for more than a year for tighter ethics rules. A series of ethics scandals involving Thomas and, more recently, [Justice Samuel Alito](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/video/martha-alito-secret-audio-recording-digvid), have left public approval of the court at historic lows. Last year, amid stories by [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow) on the justice’s jet-setting lifestyle, [the federal judiciary’s policy-making body said](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/politics/judiciary-ethics/index.html) that travel on private planes should be reported by the justices closing a loophole that Thomas said had exempted him from reporting the “personal hospitality” he had received form his uber-wealthy friends. The court’s critics argue that the current understanding of the disclosure rules should apply retroactively. Thomas, through a court spokeswoman, did not respond to a CNN inquiry about the new revelations and why the trips were not disclosed. He previously said that he was advised at the time that he was not required to disclose the hospitality he received from the Crows, but that he intended to follow the recent changes to the guidance going forward. His defenders have pointed to a 2012 letter from the Judicial Conference, which administers the regulations for judges’ financial disclosures, that cleared him of claims at the time that he should have been reporting his trips with Crow. Last week, with the release of his financial disclosures for 2023, [Thomas said](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-bali/index.html) he had “inadvertently omitted” from previous financial filings a hotel stay paid by the Crows during the 2019 trip to Indonesia and his accommodations that same year at a private club they are members of in Monte Rio, California. Yet he did not disclose his travel on Crow’s private plane for either of those trips that was revealed by Durbin. In addition to that trip, according to the documents released by Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow’s plane from St. Louis to Montana and then on to Dallas in 2017; on a 2019 round trip from Washington, DC, to Savannah, Georgia; and on a 2021 round trip from Washington, DC, to San Jose, California. “The Senate Judiciary Committee’s ongoing investigation into the Supreme Court’s ethical crisis is producing new information - like what we’ve revealed today - and makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,” Durbin said in a statement that pointed to Supreme Court ethics legislation put forward by Senate Democrats. A procedural maneuver by Durbin on Wednesday to pass the bill on the Senate floor was blocked by Republicans. Mark Paoletta, a former top Trump administration official and prominent Thomas ally, [said on X](https://x.com/markpaoletta/status/1801345222934147558?s=12&t=qE4Yyf6FCGoptJRVqjJeNA) that Thomas disclosed the hotel and private club stays from the previous trips because they were not covered under the personal hospitality exemption – even before the 2023 changes to the disclosure guidance. He argued that a justice’s stays on a friend’s “home, planes” and “boats” were exempted under the rules until the 2023 revision. Durbin and other Democrats launched probes into gifts and lavish travel Thomas received after a bombshell ProPublica report that detailed the Indonesia trip with Crow – during which Thomas and his wife Ginni Thomas stayed on Crow’s 162-foot yacht – and other extravagant trips that the Thomases took with Crow and Crow’s wife. Crow – whom Thomas has described as among his family’s “dearest friends” – [has](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/harlan-crow-clarence-thomas-relationship/674092/) [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/harlan-crow-clarence-thomas-relationship/674092/) that he has never talked to Thomas about matters in front of the judiciary. “Mr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years,” Crow spokesperson Michael Zona said of the information revealed Thursday. “Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow,” Zona added. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

ARSENAL were left furious after West Ham’s controversial opener. Here’s what the pundits said: Moyes’ men march up to sixth as Arsenal flatline TOTTENHAM icon Hugo Lloris is set to join Los Angeles FC, bringing the curtain down on his 11-year stay in north London. THE Government are under pressure to pass new laws to tackle unauthorised entry to football fixtures, following a probe into the chaos of the Euro 2020 final at Wembley. MANCHESTER UNITED could be without Andre Onana for up to four Premier League games after the uncertainty around the goalkeeper’s international standing was crystalised yesterday. IN Brighton, they will treasure 2023. A year when they scaled new heights, finishing sixth last season and taking the show on the road to Marseille and Amsterdam. When they partied into the early hours with Fat Boy Slim in Athens. Ian Ladyman IT’S the final column of 2023 so it feels only right to look back and, to a degree, forwards. So here are the good, the bad and the ugly of my football year. You will be pleased to see that VAR doesn’t even get a mention until the very last paragraph. JOHN STONES is set for more tests on the worrying ankle injury he sustained at Everton on Wednesday but Manchester City hope the central defender will avoid a lengthy lay-off.
